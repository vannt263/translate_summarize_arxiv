    "loss can be introduced by adding a spatially inhomogeneous dissipative term @xmath1694 with @xmath1695 being an odd function : @xmath1696  @xcite .",
    "this yields the model @xmath1697 where lossy and gain domains correspond to regions with @xmath1698 and @xmath1699 , respectively .    for @xmath0-symmetric kg model ( [ pt - kg ] ) ,",
    "the galilean invariance is broken . therefore , unlike its conservative counterpart ( [ kg ] ) , the model does not admit traveling - wave solutions .",
    "nevertheless , stationary solutions are not affected by the dissipation and gain and are given by @xmath1700 , where @xmath1425 solves the equation @xmath1701 .",
    "the most interesting solution is the kink , which is a topological object given by @xmath1702 in the sg model , and @xmath1703 in the @xmath1691 model ( @xmath1299 stands for the position of the kink center ) .    to study linear stability of these kinks , one substitutes @xmath1704 , with @xmath1705 , into eq .",
    "( [ pt - kg ] ) and obtains a linear eigenvalue problem @xmath1706 @xcite performed general analysis of ( [ eq : spectra_kg ] ) as well as a numerical study of stability for @xmath1707 , where the constant @xmath87 characterizes the strength of gain and loss .",
    "the main findings for sg and @xmath1691 kinks can be summarized as follows .",
    "the linear stability spectrum is unaffected by @xmath1695 ( except for a possible shift of the discrete spectrum along the imaginary axis ) if the kink center @xmath1299 coincides with the boundary between the domains with gain and loss , i.e. , with @xmath1324 .",
    "if however the kink center is shifted to the lossy or to the gain gain region , then the kink becomes spectrally stable and unstable , respectively .",
    "the conservative sg equation is also known to admit a breather solution @xmath1708}{a\\cosh[\\sigma ( x - x_0)]}}$ ] , where @xmath1709 , @xmath1710 , @xmath1299 is the center of the breather , and @xmath1711 is a constant .",
    "@xcite addressed the existence and stability of breathers in the @xmath0-symmetric sg model . unlike kinks",
    ", breathers are always affected by the gain and loss because of their time - periodic nature .",
    "this in particular makes their persistence in the @xmath0-symmetric model possible only if they are centered at the boundary between the gain and loss .",
    "numerical analysis shows that even for a small amplitude of the gain and loss @xmath1712 the breather becomes unstable through a hopf bifurcation .",
    "it was also found that if a breather is initially centered at the lossy side , then it will decay away .",
    "if , however , the breather is initially shifted toward the gain region , then its energy will grow until a pair of a kink and an anti - kink is nucleated .",
    "the nonlinear models we considered so far were constructed by adding nonlinear terms ( physically , by accounting for nonlinear interactions ) to linear models with complex potentials , dissipation , or gain . in this section ,",
    "we address another possibility , where the so - called _ @xmath0-deformation _ ( alias @xmath0-extension ) is performed by extending purely real coefficients of a nonlinear equation to the complex plane .",
    "the idea was formulated by  @xcite and can be described as follows .",
    "consider wave dynamics governed by the kdv equation @xmath1713 now under parity transformation ( @xmath1714 ) , @xmath1715 also has to change its sign : @xmath1716 .",
    "since we are dealing with a classical hamiltonian system , the time reversal operator @xmath2 results in the change @xmath1717 with simultaneous change @xmath1718 . then in order to continue @xmath1715 from the real axis to the complex plane , one can `` borrow '' from the quantum mechanics the rule of changing @xmath1719 when applying time reversal .",
    "this suggests to introduce a @xmath0-symmetric extension of the kdv equation as  @xcite @xmath1720 obviously , both equations ( [ eq : kdv ] ) and ( [ eq : kdv - pt ] ) are invariant under the @xmath0 transformation . at @xmath1721 , eq .  ( [ eq : kdv - pt ] ) reduces to ( [ eq : kdv ] ) .",
    "other physically relevant cases include @xmath1722 , which leads to the dispersive equation @xmath1723 with @xmath1724 , and @xmath1725 , which leads to the nonlinear equation @xmath1726 @xcite .",
    "another @xmath0-deformation of the kdv equation can be obtained using the hamiltonian formulation .",
    "the original kdv equation ( [ eq : kdv ] ) can be written in a hamiltonian form as @xmath1727 where @xmath1728 @xcite considered a @xmath0-symmetric generalization of the hamiltonian density @xmath1729 as @xmath1730 which satisfies the relation @xmath1731 .",
    "the latter property ensures that the energy on each symmetric interval @xmath1732 $ ] is real : @xmath1733 equation ( [ eq : kdv_hamilt_eq ] ) with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : kdv_halilt_gen ] ) yields another @xmath0 deformed kdv equation  @xcite @xmath1734    while the physical relevance of models like  ( [ eq : kdv - pt ] ) or ( [ eq : pt_deformed_gen ] ) for arbitrary values of the deformable parameter @xmath1735 remains an open question , the systems themselves possess some interesting properties which justify the attracted interest .",
    "one of them is the existence of integrals of motion , which is a nontrivial issue for nonconservative systems .",
    "in particular , model ( [ eq : kdv - pt ] ) with @xmath1725 admits two integrals of motion @xcite @xmath1736,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1737 and @xmath1738 are the airy functions .",
    "quantity @xmath1739 is strictly positive ( when @xmath1689 is not identically zero ) and therefore can be interpreted as the energy",
    ".    for other @xmath0-deformations of the kdv equation , as well as for examples of their solutions , see  @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied a @xmath0-deformed hopf equation @xmath1740 where @xmath1688 is a well behaved function , and @xmath1735 is a real rational number . for @xmath1741 , eq .",
    "( [ pt - burgers ] ) reduces to the real - valued hopf equation @xmath1742 this deformation extends the earlier results of  @xcite on the @xmath0-deformation @xmath1743 of the inviscid burgers equation @xmath1744 .    the @xmath0-deformed hopf equation ( [ pt - burgers ] ) can be obtained from its original version ( [ eq : hopf ] ) for arbitrary rational @xmath1735 through an explicit map , i.e. , change of variables @xcite . for the particular case of @xmath1745 ,",
    "the map reads @xmath1746{\\varepsilon u(iu_x)^n}$ ] .",
    "this direct mapping allows for the straightforward analysis of wave dynamics in the deformed model on the basis of the knowledge about the `` seed '' real nonlinear equation .",
    "we illustrate this on the example of shock formation @xcite .",
    "suppose the initial condition to the hopf equation ( [ eq : hopf ] ) is @xmath1747 , and consider a characteristic , i.e. , a curve in the plane @xmath1748 for which @xmath1749 . the characteristic has the form @xmath1750 .",
    "at the point of gradient catastrophe two characteristics cross and @xmath1751 tends to infinity .",
    "then by computing @xmath1752 and utilizing the above map , one finds that for @xmath1745 the earliest time for shock formation in the @xmath0-deformed hopf equation ( [ pt - burgers ] ) is @xmath1753^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] requiring the time @xmath1754 to be real , one finds that this condition is satisfied under the replacement @xmath1755 , where @xmath1756 , @xmath1757 , and @xmath1758 .",
    "thus for certain combinations of @xmath1735 and @xmath44 one can not observe shock wave formation for real solutions of the deformed equation ( [ pt - burgers ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the deformed model offers other possibilities for singularities of the solutions to occur @xcite .",
    "such possibilities correspond to a curvature catastrophe . for the inviscid burgers equation ( @xmath1759 ) this phenomenon stems from the relation @xmath1760 $ ] , meaning that the shock of the @xmath1715-field ( @xmath1761 ) always corresponds to the shock of @xmath1762 . in the meantime",
    ", the converse is not necessarily true because @xmath1763 can also occur when @xmath1764 . for other @xmath0-symmetric deformations of the hopf equation",

    "<S> recent progress on nonlinear properties of parity - time ( @xmath0- ) symmetric systems is comprehensively reviewed in this article . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 symmetry started out in non - hermitian quantum mechanics , where complex potentials obeying @xmath0 symmetry could exhibit all - real spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this concept later spread out to optics , bose - einstein condensates , electronic circuits , and many other physical fields , where a judicious balancing of gain and loss constitutes a @xmath0-symmetric system . </S>",
    "<S> the natural inclusion of nonlinearity into these @xmath0 systems then gave rise to a wide array of new phenomena which have no counterparts in traditional dissipative systems . </S>",
    "<S> examples include the existence of continuous families of nonlinear modes and integrals of motion , stabilization of nonlinear modes above @xmath0-symmetry phase transition , symmetry breaking of nonlinear modes , distinctive soliton dynamics , and many others . in this article , </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric systems arising from various physical disciplines are presented ; nonlinear properties of these systems are thoroughly elucidated ; and relevant experimental results are described . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , emerging applications of @xmath0 symmetry are pointed out . </S>"
