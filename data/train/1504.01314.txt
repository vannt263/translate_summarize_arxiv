    "this study focuses on the possibility of creating and studying vortices in a two - component spin - orbit coupled bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of ultracold atoms .",
    "the principal motivation is the theoretical proposal by spielman  @xcite , and the subsequent two experimental papers by the nist group : creation of vortices without rotation  @xcite and the study of spin - orbit structure in the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "these experiments are modeled by a bec in a thin essentially two - dimensional harmonic trap with tight confinement in the perpendicular direction . for a one - component condensate ,",
    "many studies have shown the creation of vortices with a single unit of circulation , mostly by stirring the bec to induce rotation  @xcite . in a few cases ,",
    "experiments have been able to study the real - time vortex dynamics for up to 1 s , typically a uniform precession  @xcite .",
    "the generalization of these ideas to a two - component spin - orbit coupled bec involves the concept of synthetic gauge fields , and sec .",
    "[ syn ] contains an introduction to the nist spin - orbit hamiltonian . here",
    "the principal emphasis is on a bec in a trap provided by one or more focused laser beams . for completeness",
    ", this section also mentions the recent extensive studies of synthetic gauge fields in optical lattices ( for both bosons and fermions ) , but they are not directly relevant to the present study of two - component vortices .",
    "section [ vortex1 ] summarizes the experimental procedure  @xcite that used a sudden thermal quench from the normal cold atomic gas above the bec transition temperature deep into the one - component bec .",
    "roughly 25% of the time , the quench created a singly quantized vortex ( with random orientation ) , and the experiment was able to take 6 - 8 time - lapse images of the dynamical precession over nearly 1  s.    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ syn ] , the nist procedure to create a spin - orbit coupled bec uses a focused red - detuned laser beam to trap the cold atoms , a magnetic field along @xmath1 to separate the @xmath2 hyperfine levels , and a pair of opposing external raman laser beams , typically aligned along @xmath3 .",
    "these external laser beams and the magnetic field are fixed in the laboratory , which makes it difficult  @xcite to use the usual experimental approach of rotating the condensate to nucleate vortices in a one - component bec ( in a rotating frame , these external beams and fields become time dependent ) .",
    "in contrast , the thermal - quench method  @xcite should also work well to nucleate vortices in a two - component bec because no rotation is required .",
    "section  [ theory ] discusses my theoretical analysis that relies on the time - dependent variational lagrangian formalism  @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional vortex position @xmath4 serves as a time - dependent variational parameter , and the resulting dynamical lagrangian equations show that the vortex moves on a contour of constant energy . for a one - component vortex , this picture yields a uniform circular precession . in contrast , a two - component vortex offers a wider set of structures .",
    "each component can have its own circulation quantum number @xmath5 and @xmath6 . if both have the same value ( say @xmath7 ) , then the precession should remain uniform .",
    "other possibilities exist , however , and a thermal quench should sometimes create a half - quantum vortex with ( say ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which has been predicted and observed in exciton - polariton condensates  @xcite .",
    "my theoretical analysis suggests that a half - quantum vortex in a spin - orbit coupled condensate would have topologically distinct orbits , some of which would remain in the condensate , and others that would move to the edge of the condensate and then disappear .",
    "[ sec:1 ] synthetic gauge fields and spin - orbit coupling have generated great excitement over the past decade especially with the initial realization by the nist group  @xcite for a cold atomic gas of @xmath10rb .",
    "this atom has a nuclear spin @xmath11 and the single valence electron has a spin @xmath12 .",
    "thus the vector sum @xmath13 has two values @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the lower manifold @xmath2 has three substates @xmath16 of these , only the state @xmath17 is confined in a typical magnetic trap .    in practice , creating the effective spin - orbit coupling requires an applied magnetic field to split the @xmath2 manifold .",
    "hence it is necessary to use an optical laser dipole trap ( instead of a magnetic trap ) to confine the cold atoms . for a given electric dipole moment @xmath18 in an external electric field",
    "@xmath19 , the energy is @xmath20 .",

    "laser light , the polarizability is positive .",

    "the creation of such synthetic gauge fields for atomic gases usually relies on strong laser fields that couple two or more atomic states .",

    ", these parameters would depend on the wave vector @xmath201 , and the present spinor yields the best constant variational choice .",
    "my wave function also takes the vortex singularity to have the same location for both components .",
    "in addition , the resulting vortex dynamics becomes singular near the outer edge of the condensate . to improve the description , a full numerical solution of the two - component gross - pitaevskii equation is probably preferable to a modified variational trial function .",
    "i have assumed small rabi frequency @xmath202 to ensure miscibility of the two components  @xcite , but experiments for larger values would also be of interest .",
    "since it seems necessary to use an optical trap , techniques are needed to release a small coherent fraction of the condensate atoms , but related methods have served well in similar contexts  @xcite .",
    "the nist group created spin - orbit coupling in a trap , where the raman beams provide a preferred direction .",
    "nevertheless , many groups have proposed a more symmetric rashba coupling , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ rashba ] )",
    ". it will be interesting to extend the current study to include the dynamics of vortices in the presence of such symmetric rashba coupling .",

    "<S> vortices in a one - component dilute atomic ultracold bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) usually arise as a response to externally driven rotation . </S>",
