    "metal borohydrides are potential candidates for hydrogen storage materials because of their high gravimetric density of hydrogen . among borohydrides ,",
    "alkali borohydrides such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 are well known and their properties have been investigated moderately.@xcite since these compounds are thermodynamically too stable and desorb hydrogen only at elevated temperatures , it is required to decrease their hydrogen desorption temperatures for practical applications . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the reduction of the enthalpy change for the hydrogen desorption reaction has been attained by mixing with additives,@xcite whose desorption temperatures are lower than that of pure @xmath6 by a few hundreds kelvins .",
    "although borohydrides composed of non - alkali metals can be found in literature,@xcite a little is known for their properties . in this context",
    ", we have recently investigated the thermodynamical stability of several metal borohydrides , @xmath8  ( @xmath9  li , na , k , cu , mg , zn , sc , zr , and hf ) , both theoretically and experimentally.@xcite it has been found that the stability of metal borohydrides shows a good correlation with the electronegativity of cations @xmath10 .",
    "we have also determined the structural parameters experimentally for @xmath11 and its fundamental properties have been predicted theoretically.@xcite    aluminum borohydirde @xmath0 is liquid at ambient temperatures with the melting point of 209  k. the structures of the solid phase have been investigated by x - ray diffraction measurements.@xcite cooling liquid @xmath0 , the orthorhombic @xmath4 phase was initially grown and then the transition to the monoclinic @xmath3 phase occurred at a temperatures in the range 180 - 195  k. in this study , we predict the thermodynamical stability of @xmath5 and reexamine the correlation between the stability of borohydrides and the cation electronegativity .",
    "the present calculations have been performed using the ultrasoft pseudopotential method@xcite based on density functional theory.@xcite the generalized gradient approximation@xcite ( gga ) is adopted for the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "the cutoff energies used in this study are 15 and 120 hartrees for the pseudowave functions and the charge density , respectively .",
    "the @xmath12-point grids for the brillouin zone integration are generated so as to make the edge lengths of the grid elements as close to the target value of 0.08  @xmath13 as possible .",
    "these computational conditions give good convergence for the total energy within 1  mev / atom .",
    "the computational details can be found in ref .   and the references therein .",
    "the heat of formation for the following reaction is considered , that is , the formation of @xmath0 from the elements : @xmath14 the heat of formation is estimated from the difference of the total energies between the left- and right - hand sides of eq .",

    "the packing of the molecules is slightly denser in the @xmath3 phase than in the @xmath4 phase .",
    "the structural optimization is performed for both phases starting from the experimental configurations,@xcite where the atomic positions as well as the lattice vectors are fully relaxed .",
    "the optimized structural parameters are given in tables  [ table : stra ] and [ table : strb ] for @xmath3- and @xmath4-@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the geometries of @xmath0 molecules are essentially unchanged when forming the solid phases .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data is good except for some of hydrogen related parameters .",
    "this is probably caused by the experimental difficulty in identifying h positions due to their weak x - ray scattering power .",

    "[ fig : dos],width=302 ]    the electronic structure is nonmetallic with a calculated gap of 6.0  ev .",
    "the occupied states consist of several sharp peaks whose energy positions correspond well to those of molecular @xmath0 .",
    "the similar correspondence can be found for @xmath4-@xmath0 .",
    "these also suggest the weak interaction between @xmath0 molecules in the solid phases .      in ref .",
    ", we have found a good correlation between the heat of formation @xmath16 and the pauling electronegativity of the cation @xmath17 , when @xmath16 is normalized by the number of @xmath18 complexes in the formula unit .",
    "this correlation can be represented by the linear relationship , @xmath19 in the unit of @xmath20 . in this section , we refine this relation using the additional results for @xmath3-@xmath0 and @xmath21.@xcite    in order to estimate the zpe contribution to @xmath16 for @xmath5 , the normal eigenmode frequencies are calculated for molecular @xmath0 . the weak interaction between @xmath5 molecules in the solid phases justifies this treatment .",

    "[ fig : hvsen],width=302 ]    it can be found that the results for @xmath0 and @xmath11 also obey the linear relationship .",
    "the least square fitting yields @xmath30 with an absolute mean error of @xmath31 .",
    "the addition of two new data points causes only a little change in the coefficients for the linear relation .",
    "the present study provides the additional support for the linear correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the pauling electronegativity of the cation @xmath17 is a good indicator to estimate the thermodynamical stability of borohydrides .",
    "in this study , we have predicted the thermodynamical stability of @xmath0 and reexamined the correlation between the stability of borohydrides and the cation electronegativity .",
    "the heats of formation are obtained as @xmath1 and @xmath2 without the zero - point energy corrections for @xmath3- and @xmath4-@xmath0 , respectively , which are made up of discrete molecular @xmath0 units .",
    "it is correctly predicted that the @xmath3 phase is more stable than the @xmath4 phase .",
    "the energy difference between the solid phases and the isolated molecule is small and the interaction between the molecules in the solid phases is expected to be weak .",
    "this is most likely related to low melting point of @xmath0 .",
    "the linear correlation between the heat of formation and the pauling electronegativity of the cation , which has been proposed in the previous study,@xcite is also held for @xmath0 as well as for @xmath11 .",
