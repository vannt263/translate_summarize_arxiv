    "the limiting values for the mass represent upper bounds for the sequences .",
    "the convergence of the mass @xmath227 to the mass of the corresponding limiting solution @xmath228 is exponential .",

    "the metric functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 also deviate from the limiting functions @xmath170 and @xmath235 only in an exponentially decreasing inner region .",

    "we have given strong numerical evidence , that both eymd and eym theory possess sequences of regular static axially symmetric solutions , in addition to the known static spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "these sequences are characterized by the winding number @xmath0 , and the solutions within each sequence by the node number @xmath1 .",

    "the regular axially symmetric solutions have a torus - like shape .",
    "otherwise , many properties of the axially symmetric solutions are similar to those of their spherically symmetric counterparts .",
    "in particular , there is all reason to believe , that these static regular axially symmetric eymd and eym solutions are unstable .",
    "since we can also associate the chern - simons number @xmath238 @xcite ( for odd @xmath1 @xcite ) with these solutions , we interpret them as _",
    "gravitating multisphalerons_.    having constructed the axially symmetric solutions in eymd and eym theory , it appears straightforward to construct analogous solutions in other non - abelian theories .",
    "for instance , we expect to find gravitating axially symmetric multimonopoles in su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills - higgs ( eymh ) theory with a higgs triplet , gravitating axially symmetric multisphalerons in su(2 ) eymh theory with a higgs doublet , or gravitating axially symmetric multiskyrmions in su(2 ) einstein - skyrme ( es ) theory .",
    "in particular we expect , that the lowest gravitating axially symmetric @xmath215 multimonopole and multiskyrmion solutions are stable .",
    "we expect , that the axially symmetric solutions represent only the simplest type of non - spherical gravitating regular solutions in eymd and eym theory as well as in other non - abelian theories .",
    "we conjecture , that there are gravitating regular solutions with much more complex shapes and only discrete symmetries left .",
    "such solutions arise in flat space for instance in su(2 ) skyrme theory @xcite and in su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs theory @xcite , representing multiskyrmions with higher baryon number and multimonopoles with higher charge , respectively .    but eymd and eym theory also possess black hole solutions .",
    "the non - abelian spherically symmetric black hole solutions may be regarded as black holes inside sphalerons @xcite . the axially symmetric black hole solutions in eym and eymd theory @xcite , corresponding to black holes inside multisphalerons , will be discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we expect analogous black hole solutions in eymh and es theory .",
