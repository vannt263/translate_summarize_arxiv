    "semileptonic decays of heavy mesons provide an important tool to investigate quark dynamics and to determine cabibbo - kobayshi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements .",
    "hadron dynamics is contained in form factors , which are lorentz invariant functions of @xmath4 , the square of momentum transfer .",
    "these form factors can not be calculated from the first principles of qcd by now . thus various potential models , sum rules and lattice calculations have been proposed  @xcite@xcite .",
    "recently considerable progress has been achieved in describing heavy meson decays by the use of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that in the limit of infinitely heavy @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks their mass and spin decouple from the dynamics of the decay and the description of a process such as @xmath7 is strongly simplified . for @xmath8",
    "decays hqet predictions are less useful , because in this case symmetry breaking corrections appear to be rather large .",
    "it is also important to note that since @xmath9 and @xmath8 mesons contain light quark , relativistic effects are quite significant and consistent relativistic description of heavy - light quark system is necessary .",
    "our relativistic quark model ( rqm ) , has some features that make it attractive and reliable for the description of heavy mesons .",
    "firstly , rqm provides a consistent scheme for calculation of all relativistic corrections and allows for the heavy quark @xmath10 expansion .",
    "secondly , it has been found  @xcite that the general structure of leading , next- to - leading and second order @xmath10 corrections in rqm is in accord with the predictions of hqet .",
    "the heavy quark symmetry and qcd impose some rigid constraints on the parameters of the long - range confining potential of our model .",
    "it gives an additional motivation for the choice of the main parameters of rqm and leads us to the conclusion that the confining quark - antiquark potential in meson is predominantly lorentz - vector ( with the pauli term ) , while the scalar potential is anticonfining and helps to reproduce the initial nonrelativistic potential .",
    "this model has been applied to the calculations of meson mass spectra  @xcite , radiative decay widths  @xcite , pseudoscalar decay constants  @xcite , rare radiative  @xcite and nonleptonic  @xcite decay rates .",
    "semileptonic decays of @xmath9 and @xmath8 mesons have been considered in our model in  @xcite . here",
    "we refine our previous analysis with more complete account of relativistic effects and hqet constraints .",
    "we also consider exclusive decay spectra and @xmath4 dependence of form factors .    in sect.2",
    "we briefly describe rqm .",
    "sect.3 is devoted to the calculation of form factors and semileptonic branching ratios and contains analytical expressions and numerical results for the differential distributions for the decays into pseudoscalar as well as vector final states .",
    "we give our conclusions in sect.4 .",
    "our model is based on the quasipotential approach in quantum field theory  @xcite . a quark - antiquark bound system with the mass @xmath11 and relativistic momentum * p * in the center of mass system is described by a single - time quasipotential wave function @xmath12 , projected onto positive - energy states .",
    "this wave function satisfies the quasipotential equation @xmath13 \\psi_m({\\bf p } ) = \\int \\frac{d^3{\\bf q}}{(2\\pi)^3 } v({\\bf p},{\\bf q};m)\\psi_m({\\bf q}),\\ ] ] the quasipotential equation ( [ 1 ] ) can be transformed into a local schrdinger - like equation  @xcite @xmath14 \\psi_m({\\bf p } ) = \\int \\frac{d^3{\\bf q}}{(2\\pi)^3 } v({\\bf p},{\\bf q};m)\\psi_m({\\bf q}),\\ ] ] where the relativistic reduced mass is @xmath15 @xmath16 and the square of the relative momentum on the mass shell is @xmath17\\left[m^2-(m_1-m_2)^2\\right]}{4m^2},\\ ] ] @xmath18 are the quark masses .",
    "now it is necessary to construct the quasipotential @xmath19 of the quark - antiquark interaction . as well known from qcd , in view of the property of asymptotic freedom the one - gluon exchange potential gives the main contribution at short distances . with the increase of the distance",
    "the long - range confining interaction becomes dominant . at present the form of this interaction",
    "can not be established in the framework of qcd .",
    "the most general kernel of @xmath20 interaction , corresponding to the requirements of lorentz invariance and of @xmath21 and @xmath22 invariance , contains  @xcite , @xcite scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , axial - vector and tensor parts .",
    "the analysis carried out in  @xcite , @xcite has shown that the leading contributions to the confining part of the potential should have a vector and scalar structure .",
    "on the basis of these arguments we have assumed that the effective interaction is the sum of the one - gluon exchange term and the mixture of long - range vector with scalar potentials .",
    "we have also assumed that at large distances quarks acquire universal nonperturbative anomalous chromomagnetic moments and thus the vector long - range potential contains the pauli interaction .",
    "the quasipotential is defined by  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the qcd coupling constant , @xmath25 is the gluon propagator ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the dirac matrices and spinors ; @xmath28 @xmath29 is the effective vector vertex at large distances , @xmath30 @xmath31 is the anomalous chromomagnetic quark moment .    the complete expression for the quasipotential obtained from ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) with the account of the relativistic corrections of order @xmath32 can be found in  @xcite . in the nonrelativistic limit vector and scalar confining potentials",
    "reduce to @xmath33 reproducing @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the mixing coefficient .",
    "all the parameters of our model : quark masses , parameters of linear confining potential @xmath36 and @xmath9 , mixing coefficient @xmath35 and anomalous chromomagnetic quark moment @xmath31 were originally fixed from the analysis of meson masses  @xcite and radiative decays  @xcite .",
    "quark masses : @xmath37=  4.88   gev ; @xmath38=  1.55  gev ; @xmath39=  0.50  gev ; @xmath40=  0.33  gev and parameters of the linear potential : @xmath36=  @xmath41  gev@xmath42 ; b=  @xmath43  gev have standard values for quark models .",
    "the value of mixing coefficient of vector and scalar confining potentials @xmath44 has been primarily chosen from the consideration of meson radiative decays , which are rather sensitive to the lorentz- structure of the confining potential  @xcite .",
    "universal anomalous chromomagnetic moment of quarks @xmath45 has been fixed from the analysis of the fine splitting of heavy quarkonia @xmath46 states  @xcite .",
    "recently , in the framework of rqm , the @xmath10 expansion of the matrix elements of weak currents between pseudoscalar and vector heavy meson states has been performed  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the particular structure of @xmath10 corrections up to the second order predicted by hqet can be reproduced in rqm only with some specific values of @xmath31 and @xmath35 .",
    "the analysis of the first order corrections  @xcite allowed to fix @xmath47 , while from the consideration of the second order corrections it has been obtained that mixing parameter @xmath35 should be @xmath48 .",
    "thus hqet , and hence qcd , imposes strong constraints on the parameters of the long - range confining potential .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath35 is very close to the previous one , determined phenomenologically from radiative decays  @xcite and the value of @xmath31 coincides with the result , obtained from the mass spectra  @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is an important qcd and heavy quark symmetry motivation for the choice of the main parameters of our model : @xmath48 , @xmath47 .",
    "for semileptonic decay @xmath49 of pseudoscalar meson @xmath9 into pseudoscalar ( vector ) meson @xmath50 the differential width can be written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 @xmath53 is four - momentum of initial meson , @xmath54 is four - momentum of final meson , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are four - momenta of lepton and neutrino respectively .",

    "the terms proportional to @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath80 and @xmath81 give contributions proportional to the lepton masses and do not influence significantly the transition amplitude , except for the case of heavy @xmath82 lepton , and thus will not be considered .",
    "the matrix element of the local current @xmath83 between bound states in the quasipotential method has the form  @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the two - particle vertex function and @xmath86 are meson wave functions projected onto the positive energy quark states .    in the case of semileptonic",
    "decays @xmath87 is the weak quark current and in order to calculate its matrix element between meson states it is necessary to consider the contributions to @xmath88 from figs .  1 and 2 .",

    "our previous analysis of the semileptonic @xmath97 and @xmath98 transitions  @xcite was based on the assumption that we could expand ( [ 27 ] ) up to the order @xmath99 with respect to both @xmath5 and @xmath100 quarks .",
    "this assumption proved to be quite adequate in the case of @xmath7 where both @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks are heavy .",
    "however , the final @xmath0 quark is not heavy enough",
    ". it would be more accurate not to expand @xmath96 at all , but one should do it in order to perform one of the integrations in ( [ 25 ] ) .",
    "our statement is that more reliable results for semileptonic @xmath101 decays can be obtained by using @xmath102 expansion instead of @xmath99 in ( [ 27 ] ) .",
    "it is also necessary to take into account that the wave function of final @xmath36 meson @xmath103 is connected with one in @xmath36 rest frame @xmath104 as follows  @xcite @xmath105 where @xmath106 is well - known rotation matrix and @xmath107 is the wigner rotation .",
    "the meson functions in the rest frame have been calculated  @xcite by numerical solution of the quasipotential equation  ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "however , it is more convinient to use analytical expressions for meson wave functions .",

    "we should emphasize that in order to get reliable results for @xmath8 meson semileptonic decays it is necessary to take into consideration all possible relativistic effects , including the transformation of meson wave function  ( [ 28 ] ) from the rest frame , which is ignored in many quark models .",
    "it should be noted that obtained expressions for semileptonic form factors are valid for all @xmath9 and @xmath8 meson decays , except the decays into mesons containing two light quarks ( @xmath212 , @xmath213 mesons ) , where one can not expand in either @xmath99 or @xmath214 at @xmath142 point in the vertex function  ( [ 27 ] ) .",
