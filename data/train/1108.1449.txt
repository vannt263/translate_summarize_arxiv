    "research into the optics of semicontinuous metal - dielectric films has been enjoying sustained interest due to a unique combination of novel physics and the practical applications offered by such composites .",
    "it has been demonstrated , both theoretically and experimentally , that the electromagnetic ( em ) response of these structures is dominated by a non - trivial interplay between anderson - localized and delocalized surface plasmon polaritons.@xcite this results in unusual optical properties that include : greatly enhanced absorption , giant intensity fluctuations of local em fields , giant local chiral response , and strongly enhanced optical nonlinearities.@xcite in a related context , it has been recently shown that the reflectance of semicontinuous silver nanocomposites , chemically deposited on glass substrates , strongly depends on the direction of incident light.@xcite in particular , the reflectance of such a system irradiated from the substrate / film interface side can differ by as much as @xmath0 from its reflectance given film / air side incidence ( see fig.[filmfigure ] ) .",
    "moreover , this large asymmetry in reflectance has been found to be extremely broadband , spanning most of the visible frequency spectrum .",
    "for comparison , the reflectance asymmetry of thin , _ continuous _ silver films does not exceed @xmath1 when measured over the same range of optical frequencies , and does not exhibit any broadband characteristics .",
    "it has been suggested that the origin of this large broadband asymmetry is in the enhanced optical absorbance which is often seen in percolation - type systems .",
    "here we develop a quantitative description of the observed phenomenon .",
    "the geometry of the system described in this manuscript is shown in figure [ filmfigure ] .",
    "we approximate the silver percolation film as a uniform material with thickness @xmath2 [ in our calculations @xmath3 nm ( see section iii ) ] .",
    "the microstructure of the film is characterized by the surface metal filling fraction @xmath4 ranging from @xmath5 for a bare glass substrate to @xmath6 for a substrate which is fully covered with metal . at the critical value @xmath7 , known as the _ percolation threshold _ , the @xmath8 conductivity response of the entire random metal - dielectric composite undergoes an insulator - conductor phase transition.@xcite the unique optical properties of our films are manifest particularly in the vicinity of the percolation threshold , and we therefore adopt the conventional description of the response as function of the parameter @xmath9 for the purpose of both modeling and data analysis .",
    "all theoretical and experimental results in this work use @xmath10 , which correlates well with two dimensional site percolation on a square lattice ( @xmath11).@xcite     , width=205 ]    as mentioned above , the reflectance @xmath12 of the composite film , measured using light impinging from the air / metal interface , strongly differs from @xmath13 - the reflectance measured when light is incident from the substrate / film side . since the transmittance of our system , as the transmittance of any non - chiral homogeneous film is symmetric ( _ i.e. _ @xmath14)@xcite , the asymmetry in reflectance @xmath15 directly reflects the asymmetry in losses.@xcite as we show below , in contrast to vacuum - deposited percolation films , ( i ) @xmath16 as well as the computed combined losses exhibit a local minimum at @xmath17 , ( ii ) @xmath16 exhibits broadband response in the vicinity of @xmath18 , ( iii ) the reflectance exhibits a local maximum in the vicinity of @xmath17 , and ( iv ) the transmittance exhibits a local minimum near @xmath17 .",
    "semi - continuous silver films with controllable filling fractions were deposited on microscope slides using a modified tollen s reaction as described previously.@xcite the amount of silver deposited on the substrates was controlled by monitoring deposition times , with reactions ranging between 1 - 6 h. ensuing deposition , coated substrates were rinsed with ultrapure water before being dried with filtered air and stored under nitrogen until tested .",
    "figure [ semfig ] shows a scanning electron micrograph of a typical film with filling fraction @xmath19 .",
    "these chemically deposited films appear as highly disordered polycrystalline aggregates , with large grain size distributions .",
    "in addition , we note the non - uniform coating of the substrates by the metal , resulting in highly discontinuous morphologies .    .",
    "the scale bar is 500 nm .",
    "[ semfig ] , width=302 ]    optical reflectance and transmittance spectra were collected using a spectroscopic optical microscopy setup.@xcite a tungsten - halogen white - light source was used to illuminate the samples through an inverted microscope whose output was imaged on the entrance slit of a @xmath20 mm spectrometer with a resolution of 0.5 nm . a 10@xmath21 ( 0.25 n.a . )",
    "objective was used to collect the normally incident light for spectroscopic imaging onto a liquid nitrogen - cooled detector . a high - reflectance mirror ( newport broadband supermirror , @xmath22 )",
    "was used to normalize all signals .",
    "in addition , data from @xmath23 m across the films were averaged to obtain each final trace , in order to eliminate spurious effects from local inhomogeneities in the rough films .",
    "the spectral response of the film shown in fig.[semfig ] is depicted in fig.[rtafig ] .",
    "many metal - dielectric composite systems are described by conventional effective medium techniques ( emts)@xcite by representing the composite as an effective homogeneous layer which successfully models the system s average optical properties .",
    "however , it is known that the optical properties of these films close to the percolation threshold can not be adequately described by emts.@xcite the reason for the consistent failure of emts in this case is two - fold .",
    "first , although the dimensions of the components in percolation films are much smaller than the free - space wavelength , the optical properties of the composites are dominated by the dynamics of resonant clusters that can be comparable in size to the wavelength .",
    "second , as result of a _ dc _ metal - dielectric phase transition , the effective parameters of the percolation films in vicinity of @xmath24 become scale - dependent and therefore can not be described by quasi - static effective medium models . although some percolation films have been successfully described in terms of generalized ohm s law ( gol)@xcite , straightforward extensions of gol formalism to our system are not consistent with our experimental observations .    .",

    ", the percolation film appears homogeneous when measured over a significantly large area .",
    "the transition from the scale - dependent to the homogeneous @xmath8 response occurs at the scale known as the _ correlation length _ , @xmath47 , that characterizes the typical cluster size .",

    "the optical properties of the film are calculated as a weighted average of conductive ( dielectric ) film contributions , where the average conductivities are given by eqs.([sigmam ] ) and ( [ sigmad ] ) respectively to yield    @xmath56 p(z ) dz \\\\",

    "a comparison of the experimentally obtained spectral response of the silver films with the predictions of scaling theory is shown in fig.[rtafig ] .",
    "it is seen that both the broadband nature of the reflectance asymmetry and its non - monotonic behavior near the percolation threshold are are well reproduced by the theoretical model , as demonstrated in fig.[deltar ] .",
