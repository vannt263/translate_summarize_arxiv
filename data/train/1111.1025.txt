    "relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments have aimed to create a new state of matter out of color - deconfined particles , i.e.  a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in extreme environments in the laboratory .",
    "presumably it was only up to @xmath1 after the big bang when the early universe was still hot enough to realize the qgp in nature .",
    "experimental data on intrinsic properties of the qgp suggest that this new state of qcd matter found in the heavy - ion collision is not a weakly - coupled plasma but rather a strongly - coupled fluid .",
    "the hydrodynamic description of the time evolution has successfully reproduced the measured particle distributions , in particular , the azimuthal distribution of emitted particles in non - central collisions .",
    "the great success of the hydrodynamic model is a strong evidence for thermalization .",
    "after thermal equilibrium is achieved , the time evolution of the qgp is somehow under theoretical control , though some uncertainties remain in the determination of the equation of state and the implementation of dissipative effects .",
    "in contrast to the hydrodynamic regime after thermalization , our understanding is still quite limited about the early - time dynamics toward thermalization .",
    "this kind of problem is in general one of the most difficult physics challenges .",
    "one would naturally anticipate that the system may form a turbulent fluid during transient stages right after the collision .",
    "in fact , turbulence is a common phenomenon in our daily life whenever the reynolds number exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "nevertheless , it poses a very difficult theory problem even today .",
    "it is widely known that a renowned physicist , richard feynman described turbulence as `` the last great unsolved problem of classical physics '' and it is indeed so also in the context of the qgp study .",
    "a good news is that we already have a powerful theoretical tool to investigate the very early - time dynamics of the high - energy heavy - ion collision .",
    "one may well think at a first glance that any microscopic description of nucleus - nucleus collisions is too complicated to handle in terms of the qcd first principle .",
    "this is truly so unless the collisional energy is sufficiently high .",
    "actually microscopic information of nucleus before collision is far from simple on its own .",
    "the high - energy limit , however , allows for drastic simplification that makes the calculation feasible . in the regge limit , precisely speaking , the strong interactions exhibit totally different characteristics from low - energy hadron physics . in this particular case",
    "the c.m .",
    "energy scale @xmath2 is infinitely larger than other energy scales such as the transferred momentum squared @xmath3 .",
    "then , although the strong coupling constant @xmath4 is small due to asymptotic freedom with large @xmath2 , a resummation is required for a series of non - small terms @xmath5 where bjorken s @xmath6 . in terms of the feynman diagram",
    "this resummation represents quantum processes to emit softer gluons successively .",
    "intuitively , as one goes to larger @xmath2 and thus goes to @xmath7 down from @xmath8 , one should consider more radiated gluons within a bin of @xmath8 to @xmath7 .",
    "naturally the wave function of nucleus is @xmath8-dependent and we should expect more and more gluons inside at smaller @xmath8",
    ".    eventually it should be the most suitable to treat gluons as coherent fields rather than particles once the gluon density is high enough .",
    "this is reminiscent of photons in the weizscker - williams approximation . in the first approximation in the high - energy limit of qcd , therefore , the _ classical _ fields are appropriate ingredients in theoretical computations , which is as a consequence of _ quantum _ radiations .",
    "such a classical description of high - energy qcd is called the color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite . in this way",
    ", the initial condition for the relativistic heavy - ion collision should be formulated by means of the cgc theory .",
    "as long as the gluon distribution function stays large , the cgc picture holds , and it is finally superseded by a particle picture of plasma .",
    "some unnamed physical state between the cgc and the qgp was given a name of glasma as a mixture of `` glass '' and `` plasma ''  @xcite .",
    "the glasma time evolution thus follows the classical equations of motion and hopefully it should be transformed smoothly into a hydrodynamic regime . in this sense",
    "the glasma should play a central role to figure out what the initial condition for the hydrodynamic model should look like .    because qcd or the yang - mills theory involves gluonic self - interactions , it is generally hard to find an analytical solution of the classical equations of motion except for some simple situations .",
    "hence , one has to resort to numerical methods to go into quantitative estimates , and the numerical implementation has been established . in view of numerical outputs , however , there is no indication seen in the glasma evolution toward thermalization .",
    "if all quantum fluctuations are completely frozen in particular , the classical dynamics respects boost invariance .",
    "the coordinate rapidity @xmath9 is simply shifted under a boost on the system , that means that the boost - invariant system is insensitive to @xmath9 .",
    "the pressure is then highly anisotropic depending on the beam - axis direction or on the transverse plane .",
    "this makes a sharp contrast to thermalized matter in which the pressure is isotropic .",
    "quantum ( or structural  see sec .",
    "[ sec : inst ] ) fluctuations including @xmath9-dependence break boost invariance explicitly .",
    "interestingly enough , it was discovered that a small modulation along the longitudinal direction grows up exponentially as a function of time and @xmath9-dependent modes show instability behavior , which is sometimes referred to as the `` glasma instability ''  @xcite .",
    "it is of paramount importance to understand the nature of the glasma instability to fill in a missing link between the cgc initial state and the initial condition for hydrodynamics .",
    "there are several theoretical attempts to account for qualitative features of the glasma instability  @xcite . here , instead of doing so",
    ", we will think about subsequent phenomena at later stages ; turbulence may be formed by instability growth , and then it is sensible to anticipate the decay of turbulence and the associated scaling law in the energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this article contains lectures on the basic facts of the mv model for those who are not necessarily familiar with qcd at high energy . in sec .",
    "[ sec : eikonal ] a stationary - point approximation on the functional integration is introduced , which leads to a classical treatment of the high - energy qcd problems .",
    "the classical equations of motion in the pure yang - mills theory are further discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : mv ] .",
    "then , some numerical results for the @xmath9-independent case are presented next in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , and those for the case with @xmath9-dependent fluctuations in sec .",
    "[ sec : inst ] .",
    "some evidence is presented for the realization of the power - law scaling in the energy spectrum in the non - linear regime where the instability stops .",
    "section  [ sec : outlook ] is devoted to outlooks .",
    "we will see the essence of the eikonal approximation and the scattering amplitudes of our interest in qcd physics .",
    "we will first consider the case of light projectile and dense target , and proceed to the case of dense projectile and dense target next .      before addressing qcd application",
    ", we shall first consider a scattering problem in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "if we want to solve a problem of potential scattering , we should treat the schrdinger equation , @xmath10\\psi({\\boldsymbol{r } } )    = e\\,\\psi({\\boldsymbol{r}})\\ ] ] with the following boundary condition , @xmath11 at large distance ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the term involving @xmath13 represents the scattered wave and one can obtain the scattering amplitude from @xmath14 .",
    "the lowest - order estimate immediately gives an expression in the born approximation . in the high - energy limit , however , the scattering angle is small and the incident and the scattered waves interfere strongly there . in this situation",
    "the following ansatz is more convenient , @xmath15 which is called the eikonal approximation in analogy with the terminology in optics .",
    "the wave length of incident wave , @xmath16 , is shorter than the potential range when @xmath17 is large enough , and the differential equation for @xmath18 is @xmath19 \\hat{\\psi}({\\boldsymbol{r } } ) = 0\\ ] ] with @xmath20 .",

    "let us consider the scattering of the target particles moving at the speed of light in the positive-@xmath24 direction and the projectile particles in the negative-@xmath24 direction .",

    "the cgc theory is not a phenomenological model but an extension of conventional perturbative qcd with resummation in a form of background fields . in any case",

    "although it is impossible to give an analytical formula for the solution of two - source problem , the initial condition on the light - cone can be specified .",
    "also we will introduce a gaussian approximation for the wave functions that defines the mv model .",
    "let us first consider how to solve the equations of motion  ( [ eq : eom ] ) for the light - dense scattering .",

    "then , physical observables of our interest are fourier transformed from @xmath9 space to @xmath119 space .",
    "it is now obvious that the cgc background fields at @xmath126 are relatively larger than fluctuations by small @xmath127 and the second dominant mode should sit at @xmath128 . in this article",
    "we limit ourselves to the simplest choice of @xmath129 .",

    "the horizontal axis in the left panel of fig .  [ fig : inst ] is , thus , not the dimensionless time @xmath131 itself , but @xmath132 .",
    "we can surely confirm that the longitudinal pressure component at @xmath133 increases linearly in fig .",

    "right : corresponding spectra in the @xmath119 space.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    from now on , let us consider the fate of the instability ; it is simply impossible for the instability to last for ever .",
    "the saturation of instability growth can be observed in two ways .",
    "the first case is that the initial magnitude @xmath127 ( appearing in eq .  ( [ eq : feta ] ) ) is taken to be large enough to accommodate non - linear effects .",
    "the second is the large - time behavior  simply we wait until the unstable modes grow up considerably .    as shown in the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlinear ] the instability for @xmath134 stops and the spectrum is flattened after all . in the saturated regime at @xmath135",
    "we see that the pressure at @xmath128 slightly decreases rather than increasing .",
    "this behavior can be interpreted as follows ; as long as the non - zero modes are small ( i.e.  in the linear regime ) , the energy decay from the dominant cgc background at @xmath126 makes non - zero modes enhanced exponentially .",
    "the injected energy is much bigger than the escaped energy toward higher-@xmath119 modes in the linear regime .",
    "this balance changes gradually with increasing amplitude of unstable modes , and eventually a steady energy flow is expected when non - abelian nature of non - zero modes becomes substantially large ( i.e.  in the non - linear regime ) . at even larger time , as hinted from fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlinear ] , the spectrum is flattened and the uv - cutoff effects at large @xmath119 should be appreciable . then , an intriguing question is ; what is going on in the non - linear regime before the uv - cutoff effects contaminate the simulation ?        to address this question , we shall take the latter case , namely the long - time run of the simulation with small @xmath127 for better numerical stability .",
    "the qualitative features in the results for @xmath136 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : long ] are just the same as the top curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlinear ] that represents the results for @xmath134 .",
    "we are interested in the energy spectrum in the non - linear regime that can be immediately identified on fig .  [",
    "fig : long ] .    .",
    "right : breakdown of the kolmogorov - type scaling in the uv - cutoff regime.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] .",
    "right : breakdown of the kolmogorov - type scaling in the uv - cutoff regime.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure  [ fig : scaling ] is the energy spectrum ( not the fourier - transformed longitudinal pressure but the energy contribution from respective @xmath119 modes ) .",
    "that is , what is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] is given as @xmath137\\bigr\\rangle \\;.\\ ] ] we see that there is a clear tendency to approach a scaling form in the non - linear regime ( as in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] ) . with some rescaling",
    "we find that this power is exactly consistent with the kolmogorov value , @xmath0 .",
    "generally speaking , in non - expanding systems ,",
    "it is not a surprise that the kolmogorov power emerges because this value can be guessed by dimensional analysis . such a dimensional argument may work even for the expanding system . in the bjorken",
    "coordinates @xmath9 is dimensionless , but the physical scale in the longitudinal direction is to be interpreted as @xmath138 , and thus the corresponding momentum should be @xmath139 . then , this quantity gives a dimension of length ( with @xmath140 multiplied appropriately ) . because of an expected energy flow in @xmath119 space , its rate @xmath141 is also a relevant quantity .",
    "then , the characteristic length and time scales of the system are expressed by two quantities with the following dimensions ; @xmath142 = l^{-1}\\;,\\qquad   [ \\psi ] = l^2\\,t^{-3}\\;.\\ ] ] the energy spectrum , on the other hand , has the dimension , @xmath143 = l^3\\,t^{-2 } \\;,\\ ] ] that is reproduced exactly by a unique combination of @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that @xmath145 should exhibit the power - law scaling in terms of @xmath139 whose power is identical to the kolmogorov s value , @xmath0 as long as the system stays in the non - linear regime . from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] , we can see only the scaling region or the so - called inertial region realized .",
    "the dissipative region at high @xmath119 is not found , probably because of the uv - cutoff effects .",
    "this nice scaling is lost at further later time .",
    "we can understand from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] that the energy flow is stuck at the uv edge and the energy spectrum is artificially pushed up by the uv - cutoff contamination .",
    "it was a surprise that the kolmogorov s scaling law could be realized in the glasma simulation in the expanding geometry .",
    "the dimensional argument is not so strong to constrain the shape of the energy spectrum uniquely",
    ". it should be an important test whether the kolmogorov s @xmath0 behavior can be confirmed or not in other simulations of the pure yang - mills theory .",
    "it has been established that the non - abelian plasma generally has an instability associated with anisotropy that grows up until the non - abelianization occurs  @xcite .",
    "similar phenomena of instability tamed by non - abelian interactions are found in many other examples .",
    "then , presumably , there must appear the power - law scaling in the region around the non - abelianization .    the turbulent decay and the associated kolmogorov s power - law are interesting discoveries from the long - run simulation of the glasma .",
    "but , it can not answer anything about the realistic thermalization mechanism from the glasma .",
    "the turbulence is certainly a tendency into thermalized matter , but the energy flow is a slow process and the relevant time scale , @xmath146 , is far outside of the validity region of the cgc description .",
    "there must be still something missing that can accelerate the thermalization speed .",
    "if this missing piece were finally set in , the transient glasma would provide us with the initial input for the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "even in this case , the analysis we have seen should be useful .",
    "the energy spectrum in @xmath119 space should carry important information .",
    "then , the power could agree with or deviate from @xmath0 as suggested in strong - coupling studies  @xcite .",
