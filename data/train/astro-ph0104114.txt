    "while the use of the luminosity of the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) as a standard candle dates back to 1930 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the development of the method as a safe and viable technique is relatively recent ( @xcite , hereafter l93 ) . in a few years",
    "it has become a widely adopted technique , finding fruitful application also within the _ hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale _ ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the underlying physical processes are clearly understood and well rooted in the theory of stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "the method is particularly useful to estimate distances to those stellar systems that do not contain cepheids , such as early type galaxies , and it can be applied to galaxies as far as @xmath7 mpc with the current instrumentation .",
    "the key observable quantity is the magnitude of the bright end ( the tip ) of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , that corresponds to a sharp cut - off in the rgb luminosity function ( lf ) , measured in the cousin s @xmath0 passband passband , we will always mean the _ cousin s _ @xmath0 passband , unless we specify otherwise . ] . in this passband the magnitude of the tip shows a very weak ( if any ) dependence on metallicity ( @xcite , hereafter da90 ) .",
    "the feature can be identified by applying the sobel s filter , an edge - detection algorithm , to the lf of the upper rgb ( see @xcite , hereafter s96 , for a standard application ) .",
    "the possible biases have been well characterized and quantified by means of numerical simulations by @xcite ( hereafter mf95 ) .    in this context , we are performing an extensive study of the red giant population in galactic globular clusters ( ggc ) .",
    "in particular , we have derived an accurate calibration of the rgb photometric properties as a function of metallicity , both in the optical and in the ir @xcite .",
    "the final aim of this program is to use stellar populations in ggcs as _",
    "calibrators _ for the trgb method , taking advantage of the large samples that can be easily assembled with the new generation of array detectors and cameras . as a part of this general project , in this paper we present _",
    "( i ) _ a very robust empirical calibration of @xmath1at @xmath6\\sim -1.7 $ ] , derived by applying the _ standard analysis _ to a very large sample of rgb stars in the globular cluster @xmath2 centauri  ( ngc 5139 ) , and based on a direct distance estimate recently obtained by @xcite ( hereafter t01 ) for a detached eclipsing binary in this cluster , and _",
    "( ii ) _ a new _ empirical _ calibration of the @xmath1 @xmath6 $ ] relation based on a large , homogeneous ir database of rgb stars in galactic globular clusters , recently published by @xcite ( hereafter f00 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a first , robust pillar for a well rooted empirical calibration of @xmath1as a standard candle , extending over a wide range in metallicity .",
    "this will constitute the basis for a secure application of the trgb method as an extragalactic distance indicator .",
    "the most widely adopted calibration of the absolute i magnitude of the trgb ( @xmath1@xmath9 ) was derived by l93 from the following relations , which give the bolometric magnitude of the tip ( @xmath10 ) as a function of metallicity :    @xmath11 - 3.81\\ ] ]    and the i bolometric correction ( @xmath12 ) as a function of the intrinsic color @xmath13 :    @xmath14    both obtained by da90 . using accurate v and i photometry of a small number of rgb stars mag of each rgb . ] in eight selected globular clusters in the metallicity range @xmath15\\le -0.7 $ ] , da90 estimated the apparent i magnitude of the trgb ( @xmath16 ) as the magnitude of the brightest and reddest giant in their samples .",
    "they converted @xmath16to absolute magnitudes by adopting the rr lyrae distance scale @xmath17 + 0.82 $ ] , from @xcite , and finally to @xmath18 using eq .",
    "2 . note that , in this context , the most relevant observational fact presented by da90 is that @xmath1@xmath19 , in the sampled range of metallicity .",
    "the above calibrations suffer from two major sources of uncertainty :    * the evolution of stars along the rgb becomes faster as their luminosity increases along the path toward the trgb .",
    "thus , most of the cluster light has to be observed to correctly sample the fastest evolutionary phases @xcite .",
    "mf95 stated that acceptable detections of the trgb can be obtained if more than 50 stars are sampled within 1 mag from the tip and that fine estimates can be obtained only sampling more than 100 stars in that range .",
    "the da90 samples are much poorer than this , therefore their @xmath16estimates may be affected by the systematics associated with small number statistics . * the rr lyrae distance scale is quite uncertain . while there is now some agreement on the slope of the @xmath20 ",
    "@xmath6 $ ] relation , the actual zero points is still hardly debated ( see @xcite , for a recent review ) .",
    "the most recent calibration of the @xmath21 $ ] relation has been obtained by f00 , from homogeneous near - infrared photometry of a large sample of rgb stars in nine galactic globular clusters .",
    "several hundred giants were observed in the upper @xmath22 mag of each rgb .",
    "moreover , the data - set presented by f00 extends to a much higher metallicity with respect to da90 , covering the range @xmath23\\le -0.2 $ ] .",
    "the trgb was identified by using the brightest non - variable rgb star in k band .",
    "f00 adopted the new distance scale presented by @xcite which , although still based on the horizontal branch , was obtained by using a new semi - empirical approach ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "f00 provided @xmath10 as a function of [ fe / h ] in two metallicity scales : _",
    "( i ) _ the @xcite scale and _ ( ii ) _ the _ global _ metallicity ( [ m / h ] ) scale , which takes into account also the @xmath24elements abundances . to obtain a more direct comparison with the calibration by l93 , we used the data from f00 to derive @xmath10 as a function of [ fe / h ] in the @xcite metallicity scale , and obtained :    @xmath25 - 3.76 .\\ ] ]    the larger samples used by f00 , the wider metallicity range covered and the minor impact of the extinction and bolometric corrections on infrared luminosities , suggest that eq . 3 has to be preferred to eq .",
    "1 . note , however , that the final @xmath1 [ fe / h ] relations derived by the two independent calibrations of @xmath10 are in agreement within the uncertainties ( see sect . 4 and fig .",
    "4 ) .    in order to derive the @xmath1  from the new empirical calibration , we need to combine eq .",
    "3 with eq .",
    "2 , following the relation @xmath26 . the actual @xmath12 depends implicitly on metallicity , since @xmath12 depends on the @xmath27 color of the trgb ( eq .",
    "2 ) which , in turn , depends on metallicity . to make such a dependence explicit",
    ", we plot in fig .",
    "1 @xmath28 as a function of [ fe / h ] for the six clusters studied by da90 .",
    "the data are best fitted by a second order polynomial whose equation is also reported in fig .",
    "1 . we adopt this relation to eliminate the dependency of @xmath1  on @xmath27 color and we finally obtain the following relation :    @xmath29^{2}+0.48[fe / h]-3.66\\ ] ]    which provides the calibration of @xmath1  as a function of the metallicity only ( in the @xcite scale ) .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) represent a substantial improvement with respect to previous work , since they are based on the largest ir rgb samples in ggcs available in the literature . note that the f00 survey sampled a significative fraction of the cluster light ( up to @xmath30 ) .",
    "however even in this large data - set the number of rgb stars in the upper 1 mag bin from the trgb is @xmath31 in all the cases , and the brightest star detection is possibly prone to low number statistics effects .",
    "this is due , in most cases , to intrinsic poorness of the cluster population , since the majority of ggcs simply _ do not contain a sufficient number of rgb stars _ to adequately sample the upper rgb .",
    "thus extensive observations of the most massive ggcs are urged in order to properly calibrate the above relations . in the following sections we report our results on the most massive galactic globular : @xmath2 centauri .",
    "@xmath2 centauri  is a nearby and well studied cluster .",
    "it is the most luminous globular cluster in the milky way system , therefore even the fastest evolutionary phases are well populated and it is possible to observe a quite large sample of rgb stars , fulfilling the prescriptions of mf95 . here",
    "we adopt the huge photometric ( @xmath32,@xmath0 ) database presented by p00 , consisting of more than 220,000 stars observed with the wfi camera at the 2.2 eso - mpi telescope and extending over a @xmath33 field roughly centered on the cluster .",
    "the absolute photometric calibration is accurate to within @xmath34 mag .",
    "the observed field extends over @xmath35 core radii @xcite , i.e. an area enclosing @xmath36 of the cluster light .",
    "thus , virtually _ all the bright stars of @xmath2 centauri  are included in the adopted database . _",
    "considering that @xmath2 centauri  is the most luminous globular cluster of the whole galaxy , this photometric database is the largest sample that can be obtained in the galactic globular cluster system .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 centauri  was the first globular in which a detached eclipsing binary system , _ oglegc17 _ , was discovered @xcite .",
    "this enabled t01 to obtain a direct distance estimate , independent of any other distance scale .",
    "the distance of detached , eclipsing double line spectroscopic binaries can in fact be obtained by coupling the physical parameters of the system with the relations between color and surface brightness by @xcite .",
    "this method is basically _ geometrical _ , since the distance is obtained by comparison between the linear and angular size of the binary members ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the final distance obtained by t01 is @xmath37 pc , which corresponds to @xmath38 , if we assume their adopted extinction value , @xmath39 .",
    "their result is in good agreement with previous estimates . according to t01",
    ", the error bar on the distance modulus can be significantly reduced as soon as better light and velocity curves will be obtained for _",
    "oglegc17_. thus , a significant improvement of the quoted measure of the distance modulus has to be expected in the near future . a further independent distance estimate based on a geometrical method",
    "could soon be provided also by the comparison of the linear and the angular velocity dispersion from the large database of proper motions by @xcite , once supported by detailed dynamical modeling .    in deriving @xmath1another fundamental ingredient",
    "can still be greatly refined and improved in the near future : the _",
    "reddening_. for instance , @xcite report that the @xmath13 color at minimum light of rrab variables is universal and independent of metallicity .",
    "thus , reliable @xmath40 estimates can be obtained from the _ observed _ @xmath27 at minimum light and large samples would greatly improve the accuracy . for @xmath2 centauri , in particular ,",
    "a ( @xmath41,@xmath0 ) survey of rr lyrae can potentially provide a reddening estimate with an uncertainty of @xmath42 mag or lower , since this populous cluster contains more than 70 rrab @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", @xmath2 centauri  seems to fit all the requirements to obtain an excellent calibration of @xmath1and still leaves considerable room for future improvements .",
    "a possible caveat may be associated with the wide metallicity distribution observed in this cluster ( see p00 and references therein ) .",
    "however , it has been shown that the largely dominant population is metal poor [ @xcite , p00 ] .",
    "the peak of such population occurs at @xmath6\\sim -1.7 $ ] [ @xcite , p00 ] and we will adopt this as the characteristic metallicity of the cluster .      fig .",
    "2 shows the ( @xmath0,@xmath43 ) color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the brightest 3 mag in the rgb of @xmath2 centauri  : 1777 stars are reported in this diagram , most of them being rgb stars .",
    "the contribution of agb stars is negligible for @xmath44 .",
    "the photometric errors are lower than 0.02 mag in both passbands , over the whole magnitude range plotted in the diagram .",
    "the contamination by foreground sources is negligible in this region of the cmd and the crowding is not a serious concern for such bright stars in this nearby and relatively loose cluster .",
    "the p00 sample contains 185 stars in the upper magnitude bin , which is almost twice of what recommended by mf95 for an optimal detection of the trgb .",
    "the edge - detector filter is applied on a smoothed version of the lf of the rgb , following the _ standard analysis _ as described by smf96 ( see their appendix ) . in fig .",
    "2 _ panel ( a ) _ the rgb lf for @xmath45 is reported .",
    "a sharp cut - off is clearly evident at @xmath46 .",
    "the same lf is shown in fig .",
    "2 _ panel ( b ) _ as a smoothed histogram , while the edge - detector filter response to the smoothed lf is reported in _ panel ( c)_. the main peak in the filter response indicates the cut - off point : the trgb is clearly and unambiguously detected at @xmath47 , the associated uncertainty is the half width at half maximum ( hwhm ) of the peak .",
    "moreover , the large sample of giants observed in this cluster allows us to adopt a more refined approach to the quantification of the uncertainty , by applying a _ bootstrap _ technique ( see @xcite , and references therein ) . to do this , we randomly extracted a subsample containing @xmath48 of the stars from the global sample of all rgb stars with @xmath45 , we repeated the measure of @xmath16on the extracted subsample with the same technique as above and recorded the final result .",
    "_ panel ( d ) _ in fig .",
    "2 shows the distribution of 10,428 such estimates on randomly extracted subsamples : the mean of the distribution is @xmath49 and the standard deviation is @xmath50 mag .",
    "the estimate of @xmath16  turns out to be remarkably robust to statistical fluctuations , with @xmath51 of the estimates falling within @xmath52 from the mean .",
    "we adopt the bootstrapped @xmath53 as the uncertainty on our estimate of the apparent @xmath0 magnitude of the tip .",
    "the final result is : @xmath16@xmath54 .",
    "it is now straightforward to provide @xmath1  of @xmath2 centauri  as a function of distance modulus and reddening :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the amount of extinction in the @xmath0 passband , @xmath58 is the reddening and @xmath59 is the true distance modulus .",
    "since the p00 data - set sampled virtually the whole cluster population in this range of magnitudes , it is unlikely that the @xmath16estimate will be significantly improved by new observations . on the other hand , all other terms of eq .",
    "5 can be subject to substantial improvements in their estimates , as discussed in sect . 3.1 . here",
    "we adopt the distance and reddening by t01 and the reddening laws by @xcite passband .",
    "all other sources we were able to retrieve refer to jhonson s @xmath0 , a quite different filter with different @xmath60 values . ] , with the same assumptions of da90 , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "we obtain :    @xmath62    where _ all _ the sources of uncertainty have been taken into account . the main contributor to the error budget",
    "remains the estimate of the distance modulus .",
    "it is worth checking how the existing empirical and theoretical calibrations compare with the above estimate of @xmath1 , at the relevant metallicity @xmath6\\sim-1.7 $ ] .    in figure 4 our estimate of @xmath1  in @xmath2 centauri",
    "is reported as a _ big black dot _ in the @xmath1vs .",
    "[ fe / h ] plane .",
    "the horizontal error bar represents the range in metallicity covered by the dominant population of the cluster ( see fig.11 in @xcite ) .",
    "the empirical calibrations discussed in section 2 are also plotted : the _ heavy solid curve _ is the new calibration based on the large ir database by f00 ( eq .",
    "4 ) , while the l93 calibration ( eq . 1 plus eq . 2 from da90 ) has been converted to a function of metallicity , following the procedure described in sect . 2 , and it is plotted as a _ dotted - dashed curve_. the horizontal _ long dashed line _ represents the recent result by @xcite ( hereafter fe00a ) who calibrated the trgb as a secondary indicator by using cepheid distances in a small set of nearby galaxies where both cepheids and the trgb have been detected .",
    "they found @xmath1@xmath63 ( random ) @xmath64 ( systematic ) , in very good agreement with our estimate , despite their larger uncertainty . in fig .",
    "4 , we plotted also the region delimited by the two empirical calibrations discussed above as a _ shaded area _ , in order to point out the region of the plane where most of the empirical estimates lie .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter sc98 ) provided a theoretical relation of @xmath1  as a function of the global metallicity [ m / h ] , instead of [ fe / h ] .",
    "we convert their [ m / h ] to [ fe / h ] according to the prescriptions of @xcite and assuming @xmath65=+0.28 $ ] over the considered metallicity range ( see @xcite ) . using two different bolometric corrections",
    ", sc98 derived two slightly different relations ( their eq . 5 and 6 ) , which are reported in fig .",
    "short dashed curve _ and as a _ dotted curve _ , respectively .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "4 , the _ theoretical _ calibrations are systematically ( @xmath66 mag ) brighter than _ empirical _ ones , as already noted by sc98 and fe00a .",
    "the strong constraint provided by the trgb luminosity in @xmath2 centauri  seems to favor the empirical calibrations .",
    "however , as stated by @xcite and f00 , theoretical relationships should be considered as upper limits for the trgb luminosity , since they refer to the nominal red giant luminosity at the he flash .",
    "we have used some of the most recent results from the study of galactic globular clusters to improve the observational basis of the calibration of the trgb method as a powerful distance indicator .",
    "in particular , we have derived a robust estimate of @xmath1 in the globular cluster @xmath2 centauri , based _ ( a ) _ on the application of the standard technique on the very large sample of rgb stars by p00 , and _ ( b ) _ on a direct distance estimate from a detached eclipsing binary by t01 .",
    "our result turns out to be in excellent agreement with previous empirical calibrations .",
    "expected improvements in the distance and reddening estimates may likely reduce the uncertainties of our calibrating point to @xmath67 mag .",
    "thus , eq .",
    "5 shall be considered as a very firm point of the trgb calibration ( at @xmath6\\sim -1.7 $ ] ) for the future , as well as an important observational test for stellar evolutionary models . however , even at the present level of accuracy , the @xmath1measure derived here is the less uncertain calibrating point for the @xmath1 [ fe / h ] relation .    a new empirical @xmath1-@xmath6 $ ] relation ( eq .",
    "4 ) was also derived .",
    "it turns out to be in excellent agreement with the derived @xmath1of @xmath2 centauri  as well as with other empirical calibrations .",
    "the main advantages of the new relation derived here with respect to the previous ones ( l93 , da90 ) are : _",
    "( i ) _ it is based on more solid observational basis , since it has been derived from the largest ir database of rgb stars in galactic globulars available in the literature ( f00 ) , _ ( ii ) _ it has been calibrated over a larger range of metal abundances , extending the metallicity limit from @xmath6 \\le -0.7 $ ] ( l93 , da90 ) to @xmath6 \\le -0.2 $ ] ; for this reason , eq . 4 has to be considered a much more appropriate tool for applications to external galaxies , which , in general , are significantly more metal rich than @xmath6 > -0.7 $ ] .",
