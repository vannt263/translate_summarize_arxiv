    "a typical enumeration problem given in an introductory combinatorics course is the following : how many ways are there to place @xmath6 non - attacking rooks on an @xmath1 chessboard ? the solution is to first choose which @xmath6 rows the rooks will occupy , in @xmath7 ways , then the falling factorial @xmath8 counts the number of ways to place the @xmath6 rooks on those @xmath6 rows .",
    "so there are @xmath9 such rook placements . in the special case of placing the maximum number @xmath3 of rooks on the @xmath1 board ,",
