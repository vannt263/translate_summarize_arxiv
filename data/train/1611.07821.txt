    "in 1958 , anderson showed that disorder can cause the single - particle states in non - interacting systems to be localized in space.@xcite spurred by the work of basko _",
    "et al._,@xcite recent attention has focused on the persistence of this localization in the presence of interactions and the nature of the resulting many - body localized phase.@xcite in isolated quantum systems , key signatures of this phase include a lack of ergodicity@xcite and a logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy at long times.@xcite several recent experiments in cold atom and trapped ion systems show evidence of many - body localized states.@xcite    the properties of fully many - body localized systems can be understood as arising from the presence of a macroscopic number of local conserved quantities.@xcite most , although not all,@xcite identifications of these local integrals of motion ( liom ) have associated them with pseudospins .",
    "@xcite the hamiltonian may be written in terms of these pseudospins as@xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the @xmath2-component of the @xmath3 pseudospin . while this is true for any system",
    "for which hilbert - space dimension is a power of two,@xcite a defining feature of the many - body localized phase is that these pseudospins can be chosen to be local .",
    "indeed choice is involved ",
    "liom are not uniquely defined , because combinations of conserved quantities are themselves conserved . in non - interacting anderson localized systems , it is convenient to identify the liom as the occupancies of the localized single - particle states such that the hamiltonian is expressed in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lbit_hamiltonian ] ) with only the @xmath4 coefficients non - zero.@xcite in contrast , a mbl insulator will have interactions between the local pseudospins .",
    "a variety of different schemes have been proposed for mapping mbl systems onto a pseudospin hamiltonian.@xcite    much of the theoretical work on mbl has been for either spin systems@xcite or equivalently spinless fermions.@xcite the many fascinating properties of doped transition metal oxides and of related cold atomic gas systems , which are uniquely associated with the interplay of strong correlations and disorder , motivate extending the study of mbl to hubbard - type systems . in particular , while there has been some theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite studies of disordered hubbard models , the focus has not been on identifying the liom .    here",
    "we address two questions .",
    "first , what form do the integrals of motion take in the anderson - hubbard model ?",
    "second , how can we identify the most local choice of these integrals of motion ? in addressing these questions , we hope to obtain insight into the real space interpretation of localization in a many - body system .",
    "to address these questions in a transparent manner , we consider the toy system of the two - site anderson - hubbard model .",
    "the two - site anderson,@xcite hubbard,@xcite and anderson - hubbard model@xcite have provided insights into the physics of these respective models .",
    "we take advantage of the simplicity of this system to explore all possible choices of pseudospins for which the single - particle eigenstates of the system are connected to the vacuum by a single pseudospin raising operator .",
    "we search the tremendous multiplicity of options to identify the most local choice , using a localization measure based on the strength of the support of the pseudospin operator on a single site and focusing on minimizing not the average but the largest localization measure in the set of pseudospins .",
    "we present maps of the strength of localization as a function of the on - site interaction strength @xmath5 and the hopping amplitude @xmath6 .",
    "we show explicit expressions for the resulting pseudospin operators in terms of fock space creation and annihilation operators , and demonstrate the wide distribution of localization strengths which arise for different choices of pseudospin mapping .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] we introduce the two - site anderson - hubbard model , discuss the choices available in identifying pseudospins and present our method of searching for the most local option . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the results we obtain from numerical optimization of the locality of the lioms and in sec .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] discuss the implications of our results .",
    "in this section we introduce the two - site anderson - hubbard model and our approach to obtain optimally localized lioms . for context we briefly present natural choices of integrals of motion in two simple limits ( no hopping and no interactions ) , before considering in detail the optimization of the locality of the lioms in the general case .",
    "the anderson - hubbard model is a tight - binding model which combines the on - site coulomb repulsion of the hubbard model with the disorder of the anderson model .",
    "for a two - site system , the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for an electron with spin @xmath10 at lattice site @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the number operator for spin @xmath10 at site @xmath11 .",
    "the site potentials @xmath13 are randomly chosen from a probability distribution such as a gaussian or a uniform distribution with fixed width . in the present study",
    "our focus is on the properties of individual systems as opposed to disorder - averaged quantities , and we therefore let @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that the difference in potential between the two sites @xmath16 sets the energy scale for the hopping amplitude @xmath6 and the interaction strength @xmath5 .",
    "this model is sufficiently simple that analytic expressions for all eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be found , as summarized in appendix  [ app:2siteahm ] .",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space is @xmath17 which implies that the hamiltonian can be mapped to four pseudospins .",
    "our main focus here is exploring the representation of the model in terms of lioms , a task for which the analytic solutions are convenient but not required .      in this section",
    "we discuss the construction of lioms for the two - site anderson - hubbard model , and the optimization of the locality of these lioms . before tackling the general case , we start with a discussion of the pseudospin representation of the model in two simple limits in which one can immediately identify integrals of motion : the atomic limit ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) and the non - interacting limit ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "the simplest limit is when hopping @xmath18 and the system is trivially localized .",
    "the hamiltonian contains only number operators @xmath22 and we can write down pseudospins by inspection .",
    "the first can be related to fermion creation and annihilation operators via @xmath23 @xmath24 similarly we may define @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which gives @xmath28 in this case the integrals of motion are simply the numbers of particles of each spin at each site , @xmath29 , up to a constant .",
    "these are conserved and maximally local .",
    "a second case which provides useful context is the non - interacting limit ( i.e. @xmath31 ) .",
    "here we know that the many - body states can be expressed in terms of the occupancies of a set of single - particle states , which for the two - site system are just the bonding and anti - bonding orbitals with corresponding creation operators @xmath32 the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 as well as the corresponding energies @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be determined by diagonalizing eq .",
    "( [ eq : twositehamodel ] ) with @xmath31 and are listed in appendix  [ app:2siteahm ] .",
    "if we let @xmath37 then the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath38 these integrals of motion are ( up to a constant ) the number of particles of each spin in each orbital .",
    "there is nothing inherently local about this set of integrals of motion .",
    "when @xmath39 most of the weight for a given @xmath40 will be on a single site , but in the limit @xmath41 the states are as delocalized as they can be , having equal weight on the two sites .    when both @xmath6 and @xmath5 are non - zero , the choice of @xmath40 operators is less clear , and we address both how to define them in general and how to choose them to ensure that they are as local as possible .      in the cases considered in secs .",
    "[ sec : tequals0 ] and [ sec : uequals0 ] the many - body eigenstates either correspond to occupied sites ( @xmath18 ) or occupied bonding / anti - bonding orbitals ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the pseudospin raising operators @xmath42 may thus be chosen to equal the corresponding fermion creation and annihilation operators .",
    "when both hopping and interactions are present , the single - particle eigenstates are the same as in the non - interacting case , and so the raising operators chosen in eq .",
    "( [ u0taus ] ) connect the vacuum to the single - particle eigenstates .",
    "however , applying two such raising operators will _ not _ result in the correct interacting two - particle eigenstates .",
    "this implies that pseudospin raising operators need to be modified by including terms which have no effect on the vacuum , but have non - trivial effects on occupied states .",
    "given the many possible options , a more systematic approach is required than that used in secs .",
    "[ sec : tequals0 ] and [ sec : uequals0 ] .",
