    "over the past several decades , radio maps and spectra of   21-cm emission have revealed a significant population of objects with velocities incompatible with standard models of galactic rotation , the so - called high - velocity clouds ( wakker & van woerden 1997 ) . in the milky way , high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) and intermediate - velocity clouds ( ivcs ) are distinguished by their velocities in the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , with a nominal population break at @xmath17 km  s@xmath18 . following the convention of wakker & van woerden ( 1997 )",
    ", we define ivcs to lie between @xmath19 3090 km  s@xmath18  and hvcs to have @xmath20  km  s@xmath18 .",
    "far more sensitive probes of hvcs and ivcs have become available through ultraviolet ( uv ) absorption - line studies of zero - redshift absorption lines in the spectra of background quasars taken with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) .",
    "the far ultraviolet offers much greater sensitivity to low column density gas , such as hvc surveys in  ( sembach et  al .",
    "2003 ) and  ( shull et  al .  2009 ) , and they offer the best means for tracing ionized hvc gas . the fractional hvc sky coverage using these lines range from 60 to 90% , reflecting both the higher uv sensitivity and the fact that hvcs contain substantial amounts of ionized gas undetectable in 21-cm emission .",
    "consequently , the total reservoir of hvc gas is considerably larger than seen in , and the cooling mass - infall rate could be as high as @xmath21 yr@xmath18 ( shull et  al .",
    "this infall provides a significant portion of the replenishment rate required to fuel star formation in the galactic disk . on the scale of the galactic halo , the g - dwarf problem ( pagel 1994 )",
    "has inspired a picture of continuous infall of low - metallicity gas onto the milky way disk .",
    "on larger scales , hvcs have been invoked to explain phenomena such as the `` missing dwarfs '' predicted in simulations of local group formation ( blitz et  al .",
    "1999 ) or the potential reservoir of hot baryons located in the circumgalactic medium of large galaxies ( nicastro et  al .",
    "2003 ) or in the true intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "whatever their distance , hvcs may trace building blocks of the galaxy or local group ( putman et  al .",
    "their study illuminates the processes of local gaseous infall / outflow , structure formation , and chemical enrichment of the milky way and igm .",
    "most of the framework used to interpret emission and absorption from high - velocity gas comes from a thorough understanding of the kinematics , distribution , and composition of the  column density distribution . at the high end of this distribution",
    "are those hvcs mapped through all - sky  21-cm emission surveys such as the leiden - dwingleoo survey ( lds ; hartmann & burton 1997 ) , sensitive to column densities down to @xmath22 to @xmath23@xmath3  for a standard hvc width of @xmath24 km s@xmath18 .",
    "the high - velocity  emission sky is dominated by objects of large angular size known as hvc complexes .",
    "inferring a scaled mass as a function of distance ( e.g. , wakker et  al .",
    "1999 ) restricts the large complexes to the galactic halo .",
    "uncertain distances to hvcs made it difficult to distinguish between various models and the role of hvcs in galaxy evolution .",
    "however , recent work searching for  absorption in spectra of galactic halo stars puts the distance to hvc complex c at @xmath25 kpc ( thom et  al .",
    "2008 ; wakker et  al .",
    "distance to other hvcs ( wakker et  al .  2008 ) have been constrained to 515 kpc by this technique .",
    "our group and others have devoted considerable attention to complex c , which is pierced by 11 qso sight lines observable with uv spectrographs on _ hst _  and _ fuse_. based on  and  abundances , its metallicity has been measured at @xmath26 ( wakker et  al .  1999 ; gibson et  al .  2001 ; richter et  al .  2001 ; tripp et  al .  2003 ; collins , shull , & giroux 2003 , 2007 , hereafter csg03 and csg07 ) .",
    "these surveys found that complex  c contains @xmath27 of gas , with approximately equal amounts of neutral and ionized components .",
    "some of this hvc is mixing with galactic gas as it falls toward the disk . at an approximate elevation of 10  kpc and infall velocity of @xmath28  km  s@xmath18 , the gas in complex  c will fall onto the galactic disk over the next 50100 myr , with an average infall rate of @xmath29 .",
    "fox et  al .  ( 2004 ) and csg07 investigated the highly ionized portions of complex  c , reinforcing the notion that the cloud is interacting with the galactic halo through cooling and dynamic instabilities .    while ever - deeper  emission studies have pushed the catalog of known hvcs to smaller @xmath30 , the most dramatic strides in our knowledge of the low end of the hvc column density distribution have come from uv spectroscopy .",
    "the _ fuse _  survey ( sembach et  al .   2003 , hereafter s03 ) of  detected high - velocity absorption in @xmath31% of extragalactic sight lines .",
    "our _ hst _  study in the strong line of  ( shull et  al .",
    "2009 ) found hvcs in 30 of 37 sight lines ( approximately 80% ) .",
    "although many of these high - velocity  and  detections correlate directly with -detected hvcs , a significant portion of the population has no corresponding 21-cm detections .",
    "the  hvcs not detected in  emission have been termed `` highly ionized hvcs '' ( sembach et  al .",
    "1999 ) . however , our recent studies of this population ( collins , shull , & giroux 2004 , 2005 ; hereafter csg04 , csg05 ) have detected neutral and low - ionized gas at the same velocities .",
    "we suggest that this hvc population is simply an extension of the usual hvc distribution , but with  column densities below the sensitivity level of current 21-cm emission surveys",
    ".    one interpretation ( nicastro et  al .  2002 ; 2003 ) of the kinematics and ionization properties of the highly ionized hvcs associates these absorbers with warm - hot  and  absorbing igm filaments or whim ( cen & ostriker 1999 ) in the local group .",
    "we have argued ( csg04 , csg05 ) that these hvcs more likely reside in the galactic halo , based on three major lines of evidence .",
    "first , the mass in hot gas would be unreasonably large , @xmath32d_{\\rm mpc}^2 $ ] ( see csg04 ) , compared to dynamical measures of the milky way and local group if all the  absorbers traced a whim filament at mpc distances in the local group . distributing the hvcs throughout the local group only lowers this estimate by factors of 23 .",
    "second , the kinematics of hvcs are consistent with a combination of infall onto the galaxy and outflows in other directions in the current sample , as well as that of shull et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) , about 60% of the hvcs have negative lsr velocities .",
    "third , 10 of the 12 highly - ionized hvcs surveyed in csg05 contain neutral gas or low ions ( , , ) , suggesting that these hvcs have densities @xmath33 @xmath12 to avoid being photoionized by metagalactic radiation .",
    "we argue therefore that these hvcs are similar in ionization properties to the population observed in 21-cm emission , but with lower neutral hydrogen column densities , log  @xmath34  @xmath35 .",
    "the higher ionization states ( , , , etc . ) seen in these hvcs suggests that they contain multiphase gas , produced by both photoionization and collisional ionization ( shocks or interfaces with hotter halo gas ) . a recent survey ( fox , savage , & wakker 2006 ; hereafter fsw06 ) found that high - velocity  is present in @xmath36% of the highly - ionized hvcs , consistent with a multiphase interpretation of these hvcs and a galactic origin .",
    "this interpretation is also supported by zech et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) who analyzed a highly ionized hvc toward the globular cluster m5 ( 7.5 kpc distance ) .",
    "given the similarities in ionization properties between the highly ionized hvcs and the 21 cm - detected halo hvcs , a more apt term for the highly ionized hvcs may be `` low column hvcs '' .",
    "the full distribution , kinematics , and covering fraction of the low column density hvcs is not well determined .",
    "although ly@xmath37 and higher lyman - series resonance lines are the most sensitive diagnostics of low column density gas , the absorption in high - velocity gas is rarely open to analysis in these lines , owing to severe saturation from galactic absorption and confusion with other resonance lines . considering elemental abundance , ionization , and oscillator strength ,",
    "the @xmath38 line is one of the best ( strongest ) uv resonance lines for discovering high - velocity gas .",
    "although the @xmath39 and @xmath40 lines are typically just as strong , the @xmath41 and * @xmath42 lines contaminate large portions of their high - velocity profiles .",
    "an additional advantage of the line is that it lies in a relatively line - free part of the spectrum , blueward of ly@xmath37 , uncontaminated by the intergalactic ly@xmath37 forest , and in most cases , by other igm lines .    a large number of extragalactic agn / qso sight lines",
    "have been observed with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on _ hst_. these stis archive spectra cover the @xmath43   region , enabling us to use the line to map the distribution , covering fraction , and kinematics of hvcs down to total hydrogen column densities @xmath44  @xmath3 , and below the detection limits typically available in . in this paper",
    ", we present a survey of high - velocity interstellar  absorption line along 58 extragalactic sight lines , using archival data taken with the _",
    "e140 m echelle and g140 m gratings . a previous paper ( shull et  al .",
    "2009 ) presented a study of , and   in hvcs and ivcs in the e140 m datasets .",
    "the survey data and criteria for their selection are presented in section  2 .",
    "the analysis of those data , along with line profiles and measurements , is discussed in section  3 .",
    "we explore the overall distribution , kinematics , and ionization of these hvcs in section  4 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "the initial pool of data for this study is the entire archive of _",
    "hst_-stis spectra of extragalactic targets that cover the   line . since we aim to measure absorption features of width @xmath45 km  s@xmath18 , we only use data taken with the e140 m echelle or g140 m first - order gratings .",
    "the e140 m mode provides 7 km  s@xmath18  resolution over a large bandpass , 1150  1700  , which covers resonance lines of several important ion species .",
    "the g140 m grating , when set to cover the 11991249   range , provides higher sensitivity at the cost of smaller bandpass and lower resolution ( @xmath46 km s@xmath18 ) compared to the echelle data . in order to improve detectability of low column density absorbers and to match the resolution provided by the g140 m data , we binned all e140 m data sets to three pixels .",
    "some sight lines contain both e140 m and g140 m data covering the line . in these cases ,",
    "we rely on the e140 m datasets , since they provide the opportunity to compare a high - velocity feature in multiple absorption lines and facilitate the identification of igm and other contaminants .",
    "once we compiled this set of spectra , we narrowed our survey with a few criteria .",
    "first , we limited our survey to datasets with sufficient signal to noise to analyze high - velocity features : @xmath47 at @xmath48   per resolution element ( three binned pixels ) for the e140 m data and per pixel for the g140 m data .",
    "although lower quality data may identify high - velocity features , the continuum is often too noisy to properly establish its velocity extent .",
    "second , we eliminated sight lines from the survey in which absorbers at redshifts @xmath49 significantly contaminate the high - velocity range of the  line .",
    "two sight lines dropped from our survey , 3c  249.1 and mrk 205 , deserve mention .",
    "high - velocity at negative velocity is most likely present in each sight line , as evidenced by corresponding detections in other absorption lines .",
    "however , the hvc feature is contaminated by intergalactic ly@xmath50 ( at @xmath51 ) toward 3c  249.1 and by intergalactic @xmath52 ( at @xmath53 ) from a strong ly@xmath37 absorber toward mrk 205 .    after we applied the selection criteria , our survey consisted of 58 sight lines , of which 33 and 25 are e140 m and g140 m datasets , respectively .",
    "absolute wavelength scales were obtained by aligning the peak of emission features in sight line data from the effelsberg 100-m telescope ( wakker et  al .",
    "2003 ) or the leiden - dwingleoo survey ( lds ; hartmann & burton 1997 ) , when available , with corresponding absorption line features in the stis data .",
    "we generally relied on lines of ( @xmath541199.55 , 1200.22 , 1200.71 ) and  ( @xmath541250.58 , 1253.81 , 1259.52 ) for this comparison . in a few cases",
    ", we could not find an absolute wavelength scale , owing to absence of data , or in a few g140 m datasets when the available comparison features were not clean enough to use .",
    "we now discuss our techniques for investigating  absorption from hvcs in our sample of 58 sight lines . in order to measure column densities of ion species , we first extracted individual line profiles from the full _",
    "hst_-stis spectra .",
    "these profiles were normalized by fitting low - order polynomials to the continuum @xmath55(310 )    about the line in question , although in a number of cases spurious features near the line required using a much larger region for continuum measurement . for each sight line , we searched the region @xmath56 km s@xmath18 around the  line for any possible absorption from an hvc . if candidate hvc features were found , we attempted to determine whether the feature was due to a contaminant line at redshift @xmath57 .",
    "this process was more easily performed for e140 m spectra , where redshifts of any intervening ly@xmath37 absorbers can be determined along with possible contamination of the profile from other absorption lines at the same redshifts .",
    "additionally , several of these sight lines have been examined in the literature for intervening lines , which can also be used to assess possible contamination of the line .",
    "if contamination from known igm absorbers can be ruled out , we can then assume that any detected absorption is due to .",
    "once we have identified high - velocity  absorbers , we determined the relevant velocity range by comparing the  profile to other absorption lines in which the high velocity component is detected . in some cases , the  emission profile can be used to identify the velocity range .",
    "the most useful lines for the comparison , however , are the strong lines of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , although in many cases the hvcs can also be detected in @xmath58 , the triplet at 11991200   , other lines ( e.g. , 1193.29   , 1304.37   , 1526.71   ) , and in the more highly ionized doublets of @xmath59 and @xmath60 . some of the sight lines are shared by the _ fuse _  survey of high - velocity ( s03 ) , with which high - velocity  features can be compared .",
    "the presence of a high - velocity feature in multiple absorption lines provides additional confidence that the  profile is uncontaminated by higher redshift absorption features .",
    "some g140 m datasets cover only 11991249  , limiting our ability to establish an accurate integration range , confirm detections , and search for higher - redshift contaminants .    figures 1 and 2 show  profiles from e140 m and g140 m data , respectively , for all 58 sight lines surveyed . also shown",
    "are the velocity extents of each high - velocity component analyzed .",
    "once an integration range is established , we measure the equivalent width , @xmath61 , of the high - velocity feature . using the most recent value of oscillator strength for the  line ( @xmath62 ; morton 2003 ) , we measured the column density of high - velocity  using the apparent optical depth method ( aod ; savage & sembach 1991 ) , which applies to lines that are optically thin . the linear relation between si  iii equivalent width and column density is @xmath63 .",
    "since the line is so strong , saturation , both resolved and unresolved , is often an issue . for a gaussian profile ,",
    "the  optical depth at line center is @xmath64 , scaled to a column density @xmath65 and to a doppler width @xmath66 = ( 10  km  s@xmath18)@xmath67 , chosen to reflect the turbulence and velocity components that often broaden hvc metal - line absorbers .",
    "typical hvcs exhibit  absorption over an extended velocity range , @xmath68 km  s@xmath18 , far broader than any single component would allow .",
    "indeed , the curves of growth derived for low metal ions in hvc complex c ( csg03 , csg07 ) range from @xmath69 718 km  s@xmath18 , consistent with non - thermal line widths . given these large velocity dispersions ,",
    "we expect  line saturation to set in at column densities n@xmath70 in each stis / e140 m resolution element .    in cases where saturation is clearly present in a line profile ,",
    "we adopt the measured aod value as a lower limit to n ( ) .",
    "the e140 m data have a resolution of 7 km s@xmath18 , allowing us to search for saturation in the unbinned data .",
    "if saturation is present in only one pixel in unbinned e140 m data , its effects will not be apparent in the data binned to three pixels . in these cases ,",
    "we adopt the aod value as a lower limit . searching for unresolved saturation in the final g140 m profiles",
    "is more difficult , because those data are analyzed at their full resolution . to estimate the likelihood of unresolved saturation in hvcs detected in g140 m data we begin by examining the normalized flux at the trough of all high - velocity  features in the binned e140 m datasets .",
    "we then determine whether saturation is present in those features in the unbinned data . for normalized fluxes 25% or below at the absorption - line trough in the binned data , saturation is present in the unbinned data in almost all cases . for fluxes above that level",
    ", saturation is absent in all but a couple of cases .",
    "the g140 m data have a similar resolution to the e140 m data binned to three pixels , so we adopt 0.25 as the trough normalized flux , below which saturation is likely . in those cases where an hvc has a normalized flux below 0.25 at its trough",
    ", we adopt the aod value as the lower limit to n@xmath71 .",
    "this approach gives reasonable confidence in detecting saturation down to resolutions of 7  km  s@xmath18 , but reveals little information on saturation over more narrow velocity ranges .",
    "tables 1 and 2 show the  column density measurements of all 90 high velocity components detected in 53 of 58 surveyed sight lines , including target galactic coordinates , velocity range of the hvc , and equivalent width for the e140 m and g140 m datasets , respectively . in only a few sight lines",
    "did we fail to detect high - velocity . in order to determine a ( @xmath72 ) upper limit to high - velocity  in those sight lines",
    ", we first determined whether high - velocity gas was present in any other absorption lines . in two sight lines , 3c 273 and pks 1302 - 102 ,",
    "high - velocity  has been detected ( s03 ; csg05 ) and we adopted the  velocity range to establish an upper limit on features . if no hvc of any kind was detected in a sight line , we assumed a typical hvc velocity width of 100 km s@xmath18 to establish upper limits .",
    "typically , there is little difference in signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio across 45  , except for the mrk  1383 profile where the blueward side is slightly more noisy .",
    "table 3 shows these 5 sight lines where high - velocity  is not detected , along with upper limits on @xmath73 .",
    "notes on individual sight lines from this survey are presented in appendices a and b.",
    "from our sample of 58 sight lines , we can make an estimate of the sky covering factor of high - velocity  absorption .",
    "we detected high - velocity in 53 of the 58 sight lines , translating to a covering factor of @xmath4% . in total",
    ", we found 90 hvc velocity components .",
    "the error bar corresponds to the possibility that we have misinterpreted si  iii absorption in @xmath74 sight lines .",
    "interestingly , high - velocity is detected in all 25 of the sight lines with g140 m data . in the targets covered by e140 m data",
    ", we detected high - velocity in 28 of 33 sight lines or @xmath75% .",
    "since there are several low - significance detections of weak hvcs , a better estimate of sky covering factor can be obtained by choosing a column density cutoff .",
    "if we choose a cutoff of @xmath76 for the combined hvc column density per sight line , the covering factor drops to @xmath77% ( 49 of 58 ) , with a detection rate of @xmath78% ( 27 of 33 ) in the e140 m datasets and @xmath79% ( 22 of 25 ) in the g140 m datasets .",
    "these  covering factors agree with the value of @xmath80% found in our previous paper ( shull et  al .",
    "the hvc sky covering factor has been investigated in other ions as well .",
    "the _ fuse _  survey ( s03 ) of high - velocity  found a covering factor of 59% in the full survey , and 85% if one considers only the highest - s / n datasets . where higher column density gas was probed ,",
    "the covering factor was measured at 37% down to column density n@xmath81 @xmath3  ( murphy , lockman , & savage 1995 ) .",
    "this lower covering  fraction suggests that the hvcs have extended atmospheres of ionized gas , which is best probed by uv resonance lines such as  or .",
    "although the high hvc detection rate of  indicates widespread coverage of ionized gas on the sky , there is some evidence that the gas can be clumpy on small scales .",
    "consider the sight - line pair 3c 273 and q 1230 + 0115 , separated by less than 1@xmath82 . towards q1230 + 0115 ,",
    "there are two narrow hvc features that can be detected in , as well as in other absorption lines .",
    "these features are absent in the 3c 273 spectrum , which is among the highest - s / n spectra in this survey .",
    "the narrowness of these absorption features and their absence in a spectrum along a nearby sight line suggests that they are relatively small clumps .",
    "located 5@xmath82 away from this close pair is the sight line to pg 1216 + 069 , which shows positive high - velocity absorption in multiple absorption lines , but with a completely different velocity profile than the hvcs toward q1230 + 0115 .    in several other cases ,",
    "close sight line pairs show similar absorption , indicating that in many cases the high - velocity gas is more extended .",
    "the sight lines to mrk 1044 and ngc 985 are separated by 1.1@xmath82 .",
    "each sight line shows weak negative high - velocity over @xmath83 km  s@xmath18 , with equivalent widths of @xmath84 m  and @xmath85 m , respectively .",
    "the absorption toward ngc 985 having a slightly wider feature over two components .",
    "the sight lines to pg 1049 - 005 and pks 1103 - 006 are separated by 3.7@xmath82 , each showing very strong positive high - velocity features with similar velocity structure in their  profiles .",
    "one of the more extended high - velocity features in the sky is the collection of hvcs in the quadrant of the sky comprising complexes a , c , k , and m , along with the milky way s outer arm .",
    "these complexes are all roughly connected in velocity , extending out beyond @xmath86 km  s@xmath18 .",
    "it is fortuitous that this part of the sky is pierced by numerous strong extragalactic sources for absorption - line studies .",
    "figure 3 plots the sight line locations in this survey for the region of sky @xmath87 and @xmath88 together with contours of @xmath34 from the lds over the velocity range @xmath89 km  s@xmath18 . in the plotted region",
    "we have investigated 19 sight lines , nearly one - third of the total from this survey . even though  21-cm emission is detected in only 9 of the 19 sight lines at @xmath90 @xmath3   ( roughly the sensitivity of the lds ) over the velocity range @xmath91 km  s@xmath18 , we detected high - velocity  in all 19 of these sight lines over some portion of that velocity range .",
    "even the sight lines to pg 1444 + 407 and mrk 478 , which are separated by @xmath92 and lie @xmath93 from any region of complex  c with @xmath94  @xmath3 , show clear  absorption at similar velocity .",
    "it should be noted , however , that ngc 4051 , one of the sight lines without high - velocity  absorption , lies just outside the map boundary at @xmath95 within a few degrees of 21-cm emission from complex m.    the extended  absorption probably traces thinner ionized portions of these extended hvc complexes , or a hotter envelope outside the cooler regions of high @xmath30 .",
    "the second possibility seems to be contrary to the distribution of  observed by fsw06 .",
    "they claim significant non - detections of  along sight lines only a few degrees away from the 21-cm emission of these hvc complexes , suggesting that the hot layer is closely confined to the complexes .",
    "we confirm this trend along 19 sight lines near the hvc complexes shown in figure 3 .",
    "we examined 10 sight lines in this region that contain  hvcs at velocities similar to the hvc complexes , yet outside the @xmath96 @xmath3  contour .",
    "of five sight lines with viable _ fuse _  data covering  ( pg 1444 + 407 , mrk 478 , h 1821 + 643 , vii  zw118 , pg 0953 + 414 ) , we detect high - velocity  at the same velocity in only one case ( h 1821 + 632 ) . in the other four sight lines containing high - velocity  but no , the  detections are weak . if  is entrained in an extended hot envelope to the hvc complexes , one possible explanation for the lack of  may simply be the lower sensitivity to high - velocity gas in the weaker  line .",
    "( the _ fuse _  data generally have lower s / n than stis . ) alternatively , if the hot -bearing gas is confined to the vicinity of the hvc complexes , then the  gas may trace much lower column density regions in the hvc complexes .",
    "the fact that 19 of the 58 ( 33% ) sight lines considered in this study lie within a region covering only @xmath97 of the sky does not significantly bias our results .",
    "although we calculate a @xmath4% covering factor based on the full sample of 58 sight lines , the covering factor only drops to 87% if we ignore the sight lines within the region plotted in figure 3 .",
    "another topic that can be explored with this survey is the kinematics of the detected  hvcs . in figure 4",
    "we show the locations of the 58 sight lines analyzed in this study , color - coded according to whether the detected hvcs are blueshifted or redshifted .",
    "this plot includes five sight lines where no high - velocity  is detected .",
    "also labeled are the local group barycenter at @xmath98 ( karachentsev & makarov 1996 ) and the direction of the milky way s motion , @xmath99 at @xmath100 km  s@xmath18  ( einasto & lynden - bell 1982 ) with respect to the local group barycenter .    as seen in our previous studies of hvc kinematics ( csg05 ) and noted by shull et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the  hvc kinematics shows a segregation by velocity in a dipole pattern according to galactic longitude . with a few exceptions , hvcs at negative velocity",

    "a similar dipole pattern has been observed in high - velocity ( s03 ) , highly - ionized hvcs ( csg05 , fsw06 ) , and in high - velocity .",
    "such a pattern can be explained to first order , by several models that decouple the hvcs from rotation of the galactic disk .",
    "csg05 showed that a simple model of infall from a non - rotating spherical shell of clouds produces the general segregation trend , but not the absolute lsr velocities .",
    "models with no lag do not work .",
    "if the clouds were rotating with the galaxy , they would not be classified hvcs in the first place .",

    "significant advances in hvc studies could therefore come from improvements in 21-cm sensitivity , reaching below the current limits of @xmath114  @xmath3 .",

    "this pattern is seen through a segregation of redshifted and blueshifted absorbers across the galactic rotation axis at @xmath143 and is consistent with a lag in rotation velocity above the galactic plane .",
    "such a pattern can be explained by several models that decouple the hvcs from rotation of the galactic disk .    what do these results indicate for the ionization state and total hydrogen column densities of the hvc population ? with stis / e140 m , the  @xmath144 absorption line is sensitive to column densities at or below n@xmath145  @xmath3)@xmath146 , corresponding to equivalent width @xmath147 ( 21.0  m)@xmath146 .",
