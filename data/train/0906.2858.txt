    "recently , the pseudorapidity particle density from a wounded nucleon was determined by analysing the phobos data @xcite on deuteron - gold collisions at @xmath1 gev in the framework of the wounded nucleon @xcite and the wounded quark - diquark @xcite models .",
    "the obtained fragmentation function has two characteristic features .",
    "it is peaked in the forward direction and it substantially feeds into the opposite hemisphere , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_wn ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite very similar shape of the contribution from a wounded nucleon was found at sps energy of @xmath2 gev .",
    "the possible explanation of the main features of the wounded nucleon fragmentation function was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the model based on the bremsstrahlung mechanism @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 substantially feeds into the opposite hemisphere which implies specific long - range forward - backward multiplicity correlations . ]",
    "it is interesting to notice that the picture in which the wounded nucleon populates particles into the opposite hemisphere implies specific long - range forward - backward multiplicity correlations .",
    "this problem will be investigated here in the context of the ua5 @xmath4 forward - backward multiplicity correlation data at @xmath1 gev @xcite .",
    "namely , we will test the model with two independent sources of particles , see fig .",
    "[ fig_two ] , with the wounded nucleon fragmentation function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_wn ] . for comparison",
    ", we will also study the model in which particles are produced from only one source of particles e.g. , a single string spanned between two wounded nucleons .",
    "our main conclusion is that the model with two independent sources of particles and the wounded nucleon fragmentation function extracted from the phobos @xmath5 data is fully consistent with the ua5 @xmath4 forward - backward multiplicity correlation data at @xmath1 gev . at the same time",
    "we conclude that the model with only one source of particles is in a very clear disagreement with the data .",
    "let us emphasize here that the idea of the multicomponent model of soft particle production is not new and was successfully applied to the forward - backward multiplicity correlations data by many authors @xcite .",
    "our model with two sources of particles has very much in common with the dual parton model @xcite or the two - chain dual model with non - zero asymmetry of each chain @xcite . for other approaches",
    "@xcite .    in the next section",
    "basic formulae are introduced . in section",
    "@xmath6 we present our model in detail and derive for @xmath7 collisions the analytical expressions for the correlation coefficient and the functional relation between the average number of particles in the backward interval at a given number of particles in the forward one .",

    "if the number of particles in @xmath12 interval does not dependent on the number of particles in @xmath14 i.e. , @xmath16 we have @xmath17 . on the other hand , if @xmath18 in every event then @xmath19 ( maximum correlation ) . using definition ( [ h1 ] )",

    "the schematic view of our model is presented in fig . [ fig_two ] .",
    "we assume that in @xmath7 collisions all soft particles are produced from two independent wounded nucleons , which populate particles according to the fragmentation function . ]",
    "presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_wn ] .",
    "additionally , we assume that in @xmath7 collisions the multiplicity distribution in the combined interval @xmath25 is described be the negative binomial ( nb ) distribution@xmath26 where @xmath27 is the average multiplicity in @xmath25 and @xmath28 measures deviation from poisson distribution .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath27 can be calculated as @xmath29   d\\eta=2\\int_{b+f}\\rho_{r}\\left (   \\eta\\right )   d\\eta , \\label{mn}%\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the pseudorapidity densities of produced particles from the right- and left - moving wounded nucleons , respectively .",
    "recently , we have shown @xcite that the generating function ( [ h1 ] ) in the framework of the above - mentioned model may be written as@xmath32 \\right\\ }   ^{-k/2}\\times\\nonumber\\\\ &   \\times\\left\\ {   1+\\frac{\\bar{n}}{k}\\left [   p_{rb}\\left (   1-z_{b}\\right ) + p_{rf}\\left (   1-z_{f}\\right )   \\right ]   \\right\\ }   ^{-k/2 } , \\label{h2}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the probability that a particle originating from the right - moving wounded nucleon goes to @xmath14 interval rather than to @xmath12 ( and analogous for @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , see fig . [ fig_two ] .",
    "these probabilities satisfy the following conditions @xmath36 these numbers can be easily calculated using the wounded nucleon fragmentation function .",
    "for instance , @xmath33 has the form@xmath37    taking ( [ b_def ] ) , ( [ b_poch ] ) and ( [ h2 ] ) into account and performing elementary calculations , the following expression for the correlation coefficient in the model with two independent sources of particles is obtained@xmath38 assuming that intervals @xmath12 and @xmath14 are separated enough so that @xmath14 can be populated only by the right - moving nucleon and @xmath12 only by the left - moving one i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath40 we obtain @xmath17 .",
    "thus , we immediately predict the noticeable suppression of the correlation coefficient @xmath20 with increasing distance between @xmath12 and @xmath14 intervals .    in the model with two independent sources of particles the relation between the average number of particles @xmath22 in the backward interval @xmath12 at a given number of particles @xmath13 in the forward interval @xmath14 has the form [ see ( [ line_def ] ) , ( [ line_poch ] ) and ( [ h2])]@xmath41 where@xmath42 and the hypergeometric function @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44    for comparison we also derive the appropriate formulae in the model with only one source of particles e.g. , a single string spanned between two wounded nucleons .",
    "these expressions can be easily obtained from ( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ nbm2 ] ) by _ deactivating _ one of the sources e.g. , the left one . in this case",
    "@xmath45 ( thus @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
