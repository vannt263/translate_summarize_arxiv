    "one of the most promising contemporary applications of quantum mechanics is within cryptography , where the laws of quantum physics certify the secrecy of a communication protocol . in quantum key distribution",
    ", the communication protocol aims at establishing a shared key between two legitimate parties , alice and bob , in such a way that a third party , say eve , who eavesdrops on and tampers with the communication line , obtains virtually no information about the key  @xcite .",
    "the key itself is generated randomly , possibly to serve as a one - time pad .",
    "on the other hand , in a private communication protocol , the sender , say alice , aims at sending private messages to bob  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the content of the messages is under the control of alice and it is not random from her point of view . clearly , any private communication protocol can be also used for key distribution .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a private communication protocol , based on the phenomenon of quantum data locking ( qdl )  @xcite , that achieves a private communication rate as high as less than one bit below the classical capacity for non - private communication .",
    "our protocol provides a scheme for realizing a _ quantum enigma machine _ , a quantum optical cipher based on the qdl effect  @xcite .",
    "it can be implemented experimentally using standard technologies routinely applied in quantum key distribution in setups where information is encoded by single - photon states spread over @xmath0 optical modes .",
    "the security of our private communication protocol is assessed in terms of the accessible information criterion , which is not the standard and widely accepted security criterion in quantum cryptography .",
    "a detailed comparison of the two security criteria is given in @xcite .",
    "this security criterion is in general weaker than the standard security criterion of quantum cryptography .",
    "for this reason , before proceeding with the description of the protocol , we make a brief detour to clarify in which context the accessible information yields reliable security , as well as to review the phenomenon of qdl .",
    "suppose that alice s messages are generated by a source described by the random variable @xmath1 , with probability distribution @xmath2 , and the conditional states obtained by eve are @xmath3 .",
    "the ensemble state of the joint system of alice and eve is hence given by the density matrix @xmath4 .",
    "let us recall that the accessible information is defined as the maximum classical mutual information between alice s input and the result of an optimal measurement performed by eve on her share of the quantum system .",
    "a local measurement by eve is a map @xmath5 whose output is the classical variable @xmath6 .",
    "then the accessible information of the state @xmath7 reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the classical mutual information , and @xmath10 denotes the shannon entropy .    to assess the security of our protocol ,",
    "we show that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dimension of eve s quantum system , and the security parameter @xmath13 can be made arbitrarily small under suitable conditions .",
    "this means that the outputs of any measurement by eve are arbitrarily close to being independent of alice s messages .",
    "when used as a security quantifier , the accessible information suffers from a major problem : it does not guarantee composable security .",
    "roughly speaking , composable security means that if two communication protocols are secure individually then they remain secure when composed @xcite .",
    "the fact that the accessible information does not ensure composability is intimately related to the very effect of qdl  @xcite . however , as discussed in  @xcite , the accessible information yields composable security conditioned on certain physical assumptions .",
    "a physical assumption that guarantees composable security is that the eavesdropper is forced to measure her share of the state as soon as she obtains it , as is the case , for instance , when she does not have access to a quantum memory .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the accessible information concerns the output of eve s measurements , and not the quantum state itself .",
    "another assumption that implies composable security is that eve possesses a quantum memory with finite coherence time . in the simplest model ,",
    "eve either measures her share of the quantum system within a time @xmath14 or the quantum memory decoheres and becomes classical .",
    "suppose the given communication protocol is used as a subroutine of a larger protocol .",
    "composable security is granted if alice and bob know the coherence time of eve s quantum memory and wait for a time sufficiently longer than @xmath14 before proceeding .",
    "clearly , too large values of @xmath14 would make the protocol impractical .",
    "however , as discussed in  @xcite , in a stationary regime the overall asymptotic communication rate is independent of @xmath14 and remains finite even in the limit @xmath15 .    by making assumptions on the technological capabilities of the eavesdropper we are in fact restricting the class of allowed attacks .",
    "in quantum cryptography one distinguishes three kinds of attacks : individual attacks ( where the eavesdropper applies local measurement to the output of each use of the communication channel ) ; collective attacks ( where the eavesdropper is allowed to store quantum information for an indeterminate amount of time before applying a collective measurement on the output of multiple channel uses ) ; and coherent attack ( where the eavesdropper is allowed to tamper with the communication line in an arbitrary way ) .",
    "the assumption that the eavesdropper has a quantum memory with finite coherence time defines a class of attack that lie in between individual and collective attacks . as in individual attacks ,",
    "the eavesdropper can not store quantum information for an arbitrarily long time .",
    "however , in our case we allow the eavesdropper to store quantum information for a finite time and to apply a collective measurement on the output of multiple channel uses .    to be fair , our communication protocol is defined under the assumption that the legitimate receiver bob is constrained by the same technological limitations as the eavesdropper eve .      below",
    "we introduce a private communication protocol that is secure according to the accessible information criterion .",
    "such a protocol is a qdl protocol . in a typical qdl protocol",
    ", the legitimate parties , alice and bob , publicly agree on a set of @xmath16 codewords in a high - dimensional quantum system . from this set , they then use a short shared secret key of @xmath17 bits to select a set of @xmath18 codewords that they will use for sending information . if the eavesdropper does not know the secret key , then the number of bits , as quantified by the accessible information , that she can obtain about the message is essentially equal to zero for certain choices of codewords .",
    "in most of the known qdl protocols codewords are chosen from different bases , and the secret key identifies the basis to which the codewords belong .",
    "here we apply a random coding approach and assume that all the @xmath16 codewords are chosen randomly .",
    "a number of works have been devoted to the role of qdl in physics and information theory  @xcite .",
    "however , only recently qdl has been considered in the presence of noise  @xcite .",
    "a formal definition of the _ locking capacity _ of a communication channel has been introduced in  @xcite , as the maximum rate at which information can be reliably and securely transmitted through a ( noisy ) quantum channel @xmath19 from alice to bob , where the security is quantified by the accessible information .",
    "motivated by qdl protocols , we also allow the assistance of an initial secret key shared by alice and bob . in order for this key to be inexpensive in the asymptotic limit , we further require that the bits of secret key grow sublinearly with the number of channel uses .",
    "two notions of locking capacities were defined in  @xcite : the _ weak locking _",
    "capacity and the _",
    "strong locking _ capacity .",
    "the weak locking capacity is defined by requiring security against an eavesdropper who measures the output of the complementary channel ( denoted as @xmath20 ) of the channel from alice to bob .",
    "can always be represented as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a pure state of the environment @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a unitary transformation coupling the system with the environment .",
    "the conjugate channel of @xmath19 is then defined by @xmath25 . ]",
    "the strong locking capacity is instead defined by requiring security against an eavesdropper who is able to measure the very input of the channel . in general , the weak locking capacity is larger than or at least equal to the strong locking capacity , as any strong locking protocol also defines a weak locking one .",
    "it is natural to compare the weak locking capacity with the private capacity  @xcite .",
    "since the latter is defined by the stronger standard security criterion of quantum cryptography , it follows that the weak locking capacity is always larger than or at most equal to the private capacity .",
    "finally , both locking capacities can not exceed the classical capacity , which is the maximum rate of reliable communication allowed by the channel ( not requiring any secrecy )  @xcite .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , there exist qudit channels with low or even zero private capacity whose weak locking capacity is larger than one half of the classical capacity . in our previous work ,",
    "we have obtained key generation protocols that achieve a strong locking rate just one bit smaller than the classical capacity  @xcite .    in a cryptographic setting , the notions of strong and weak data locking capacity correspond to different kinds of attacks by the eavesdropper . in a strong locking scenario",
    ", we are imaging that the eavesdropper can obtain a noiseless version of the input states sent by alice . if the strong locking capacity is nonzero , this mean that these messages can remain locked to eve .",
    "this is something that can not happen if the standard security criterion is applied . in a weak locking scenario",
    ", we are instead imagining that the eavesdropper has access to the environment of the channel .",
    "this attack is similar to a collective attack .",
    "however , as discussed in the previous section , the weak locking attack lies in between the collective and individual attacks .",
    "the first result we present in this paper is a qdl protocol for the @xmath0-dimensional noiseless channel , see section  [ sec : noiseless ] .",
    "the protocol allows qdl ( in the strong sense ) of the noiseless qudit channel at a rate of @xmath26 bits per channel use , equal to its classical capacity , and consumes secret key at an asymptotic rate of less than @xmath27 bit per channel use .",
    "the crucial property of this protocol that distinguishes it from prior work on the topic ( e.g. @xcite ) is that it employs codewords that are separable among different channel uses.this property allows us to generalize the protocol to the case of noisy memoryless channels and to obtain achievable rates of strong and weak locking for a physically motivated family of qudit channels , see sections  [ sec : strong ] and  [ sec : weak ] .",
    "in this section we define a strong locking protocol for direct communication via a noiseless qudit channel .",
    "this is an improved version of a similar protocol for quantum key distribution that we have introduced in  @xcite .",
    "sections  [ sec : pre ] ,  [ sec : eve ] ,  [ sec : enet ] , and  [ sec : impro ] present the proof of our main results .",
    "applications to ( weak and strong ) locking of noisy memoryless channels are then presented in sections  [ sec : strong ] and  [ sec : weak ] .    to encode @xmath18 messages in @xmath28 qudits",
    ", alice prepares one of the codewords @xmath29 for @xmath30 , where the vectors @xmath31 are independently sampled from an ensemble of qudit states @xmath32 .",
    "may not be orthogonal .",
    "in general , one could also replace them with mixed states .",
    "] alice and bob publicly agree on a set of @xmath33 @xmath28-qudit local unitaries @xmath34 for @xmath35 . according to the value of the secret key , alice applies the unitary transformation @xmath36 to scramble the @xmath28-qudit codewords , obtaining @xmath37    in the strong locking scenario , we assume that eve intercepts the whole train of qudit systems and measures them . since eve does not have access to the secret key , we have to compute the accessible information of the state @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an orthonormal basis for an auxiliary dummy quantum system associated to alice and @xmath40 is the probability of the codeword @xmath41 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity here we assume that all the messages have equal probability , that is , @xmath42 ( the case of non - uniform distribution has been considered in  @xcite ) .",
    "one can upper bound the accessible information as follows ( see appendix [ app : ub ] ) : @xmath43 - \\eta\\left [ \\sum_{c=1}^m q_c(\\phi)\\right ] \\right\\ } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath44 @xmath45 = - \\sum_{c=1}^m q_c(\\phi ) \\log{q_c(\\phi ) } \\ , , \\ ] ] @xmath46 , and the minimization is over all @xmath28-qudit unit vectors @xmath47 .    in the following sections  [ sec : pre ] ,  [ sec : eve ] ,  [ sec : enet ] , and  [ sec : impro ] , we show that there exist choices of the unitaries @xmath48 such that @xmath49 provided that @xmath50 with @xmath51    in particular , if we put @xmath52 in  ( [ k - bound - imp - preview ] ) with @xmath53 , eve s accessible information will be exponentially small in @xmath28 , with an asymptotic secret key consumption rate ( in bits per channel use ) equal to @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "to show that , we make use of a random coding argument based on random choices of both the codewords and the data locking unitaries . in particular ,",
    "each of the unitaries @xmath56 is generated independently and randomly by sampling from the uniform haar distribution of @xmath0-dimensional unitaries @xcite .",
    "for the case of a noiseless channel , since bob knows the unitary @xmath36 chosen by alice , he can simply apply the inverse transformation @xmath57 and then perform an optimal measurement to discriminate between the codewords @xcite .",
    "we consider random codewords generated by sampling independently and identically each of the qudit state @xmath31 from a given ensemble of input states .",
    "it is well known that in such a setting bob can decode reliably in the limit @xmath58 if @xmath59 , with @xmath13 vanishing in the limit @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "for instance , putting @xmath52 for @xmath60 one obtains an asymptotic rate of communication of @xmath61 bits per channel use , with a secret key consumption rate of less than @xmath27 bit per channel use .      to characterize our qdl protocol",
    "we will make use of two concentration inequalities .",

    "the point is that in a strong locking setting we require that the communication is secure against an eavesdropper having access to the very input of the channel . in other words ,",
    "the security of the protocol is independent of how the channel acts on the input , and hence it applies to the noiseless case as well as the noisy one .",
    "that is , the bound on the accessible information in equation  ( [ iacc - final - nl ] ) and the condition on the number of key values in equation  ( [ k - final ] ) apply for a generic qudit channel .",
    "the crucial difference , however , is that the presence of noise reduces the rate at which alice and bob can reliably communicate classical information .",
    "let us suppose that , using the codewords described above , alice and bob can achieve a reliable communication rate of @xmath159 bits per channel use  @xcite .",
    "then ( [ k - final ] ) implies an asymptotic key consumption rate of @xmath160 since @xmath161 can not exceed @xmath26 , we obtain an increase in the secret key consumption rate with respect to the noiseless setting .",
    "we can say that the latter equation represents a trade - off between communication rate and secret key consumption . in order to achieve strong locking ,",
    "the secret key consumption rate should increase to compensate the reduced communication rate .",
    "in the weak locking scenario the eavesdropper has access to the output of the complementary channel , hence receiving a signal distorted by noise .",
    "one thus expects that the randomness introduced by the noise contributes to the qdl effect .",
    "if this is true , then one can exploit the randomness due to the noise to reduce the length of the required secret key .",
    "below we show that this intuition is true by examining a family of channels of a specific form .",
    "we define these channels through their conjugates , which are of the form @xmath162 where @xmath163 $ ] and @xmath164 is a given density matrix ( notable examples of channels belonging to this family are the erasure channel and the conjugate of the depolarizing channel ) .",
    "the results for the noiseless case can be easily applied to these channels . to do that , it is sufficient to notice that , with probability @xmath165 , the channel @xmath166 is noiseless . in other words , for @xmath28 uses of the channel",
    ", one expects that the channel @xmath166 will act as an effective noiseless channel over a fraction of about @xmath167 qudits .",
    "it is sufficient to require that the protocol data locks the information contained in these qudits , since the remaining @xmath168 qudits do not convey any information at all about the message as the output is independent of the input .    more formally , upon @xmath28 uses of the channel eve receives ( with probability arbitrarily close to @xmath27 for @xmath28 large enough ) no more than @xmath169 qudits without any distortion .",
