    "david divincenzo put forward five criteria for the candidates of quantum computing hardware to be satisfied @xcite .",
    "one of which is the low decoherence .",
    "an approximate benchmark of the criterion is a fidelity loss no more than @xmath3 per elementary quantum gate operation .",
    "the josephson junction is considered to be a promising physical realization of qubit .",
    "so it is a very significative work to investigate the decoherence of the qubits based on the josephson junctions . to perform quantitative studying of the decoherence for a given system , in general",
    ", one must firstly solve the quantum dynamics problem of the system coupled to the environment .",
    "many kinds of methods have been used for this purposes @xcite @xcite .",
    "the decoherence of the qubit based on josephson junctions have been studied by many authors . in their investigations",
    "the dynamics appeal to the redfield formalism @xcite or bloch - type rmp2001 master equations , where the markov approximation are used markov .",
    "the approximation is usually used to evaluate approach to the thermal state at large times . however",
    ", a quantum gate operation is finished in a instantaneous time so the approximation may be not suitable to investigate the decoherence of the qubit gates for quantum computing purposes .",
    "recently , v. privman _",
    "et al_. introduced two measures to quantify the short - time decoherence @xcite @xcite .",
    "the measures are based on the short - time approximation of the split - operator and derived from a operator norm @xmath4 ( seeing the following definition ) . by using these measures v. privman _",
    "et al_. investigated some spin - boson models . in this paper",
    "we use one of the measures investigating the short - time decoherence of the single josephson charge qubit ( jcq ) operations .",
    "in this section we firstly review the jcq model and then introduce the measure of decoherence used in this paper .",
    "the single jcq hamiltonian is @xcite@xmath5here , @xmath6 is the charging energy ; @xmath7 is the josephson coupling energy @xcite , where @xmath8 is the critical current of the josephson junction , @xmath9 the planck s constant divided @xmath10 and @xmath11 the charge of electron ; @xmath12 is the dimensionless gate charge , where @xmath13 is the gate capacitance , @xmath14 the controllable gate voltage .",
    "the number operator @xmath15 of ( excess ) cooper pair on the island , and the phase @xmath16 of the superconducting order parameter , are quantum mechanically conjugate@xmath17 because the josephson coupling energy @xmath18 is much smaller than the charging energy @xmath19 , and both of them are much smaller than the superconducting energy gap @xmath20 , the hamiltonian eq.([eq1 ] ) can be parameterized by the number of the cooper pairs @xmath15 on the island as rmp2001 @xcite@xmath21 \\right\\ } .",
    "\\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\]]when @xmath22 is modulated to a half - integer , say @xmath23 the levels of two adjacent states are close to each other , the josephson tunneling mixes them strongly .",
    "when the temperature @xmath24 is low enough the system can be reduced to a two - state system ( qubit ) because all other charge states have much higher energy and can be neglected .",
    "so the hamiltonian of the system can _ approximately _",
    "reads@xmath25where @xmath26 and @xmath27 eq.([eq3 ] ) is similar to the ideal single qubit model @xcite , but it can be modulated only by changing one parameter @xmath28 however , changing the parameter @xmath29 ( through switching the gate voltage ) one can perform the required one - bit operations . if , for example , one chooses the idle state far to the left from the degeneracy point , the eigenstate lose to @xmath30 and @xmath31 then switching the system suddenly to the degeneracy point for a time @xmath32 and back produces a rotation in spin space @xcite,@xmath33this can be obtained by modulating the gate voltage and making @xmath34 so it is interesting for our to investigate the decoherence of this kind of qubit . if we consider the interaction of the qubit and its environment the total hamiltonian becomes@xmath35where @xmath36 is the environment hamiltonian which is usually modelled by a bath of an infinite number of the harmonic oscillator models which is equivalence to an infinity - mode electromagnetic field . the dissipation and the decoherence of the quantum systems",
    "is considered because of the coupling of the quantum system and the fluctuating electromagnetic field . in the jcq model",
    ", the coupling of the qubit with the electromagnetic fluctuations can be modeled by a impedance @xmath37 placed in series with the voltage ( see fig.1 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the bath hamiltonian @xmath38 and the interaction hamiltonian @xmath39 are @xmath40where @xmath41 and@xmath42here , @xmath43 are the bath mode frequencies , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are bosonic create and annihilation operators .",
    "@xmath46 are the freedom of environment and it is direct proportion to the fluctuations of the voltage of the external circuits @xcite  @xcite and @xmath47 are the coupling constants .",
    "because the bath modes are infinite , their frequencies can be taken continuous .",
    "the spectral density of the continuous bath modes is@xmath48because it can result in a same johnson - nyquist relation which can be obtained from fluctuation - dissipation theorem on this system . on the other hand , at low - frequency , the spectral density behavior is@xmath49where @xmath50 is the high - frequency cut - off and @xmath51 is the dimensionless strength of the dissipation . according to ref.chemphys295 we know that in the particular interest ohmic case @xmath52 @xcite , for the model of jcq coupling with electromagnetic fluctuations ( see fig.1 of ref.@xcite ) , @xmath53where @xmath54 is the ( superconducting ) resistance quantum . from eqs.([eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) we know that for a ohmic bath@xmath55where @xmath56 is the density of states .",
    "there are many measures to characterize the decoherence .",
    "usually the environment being assumed to be a large macroscopic the interaction with it leads to the thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath24 . in this case , markovian type approximations can be used to quantified the decoherent process and it usually yields the exponential decay of the density matrix elements in the energy basis of the hamiltonian @xmath57 in this time scale the measures of entropy and the first entropy are used for quantifying the decoherence .",
    "but the decoherence of the qubit gate operations can not be characterized by this methods because the time of the elementary quantum gate operation is much shorter than the thermal relaxation time .",
    "it has been shown that the norms @xmath58 is useful for describing the decoherence of the short - time evolution . here",
    "@xmath59 is the deviation operator defined as @xmath60where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are density matrixes of the real  evolution ( with interaction ) and the ideal  one ( without interaction ) of the investigated system .",
    "@xmath63 is defined as @xmath64for a qubit , the norm can be given by@xmath65for a given system , the norm @xmath66 increase with time , reflecting the decoherence of the system . however , in general it is oscillated at the system s internal frequency .",
    "thus , the decohering effect of the bath is better quantified by the maximal operator norm , @xmath67 this norm is also defined a measure for characterizing the short - time decoherence . @xmath68 in the following , we will calculate the @xmath69 then the decoherence @xmath70 of the jcq .",
    "as shown in above subsection , to calculate the decoherence of the jcq we must study its evolution under the interaction of the qubit with its environment .",
    "suppose the initial state of the system be @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the initial state of jcq and @xmath73 is the initial state of the environment , which is the product of the bath modes density matrices  @xmath74 . in the initial states ,",
    "each bath mode @xmath75 is assumed to be thermalized , namely,@xmath76where @xmath77 , @xmath75 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "so the evolution operator may be@xmath78 in the following we set @xmath79 due to non - conservation of @xmath80 in this system , the evolution operator can not be in a general way expressed as @xmath81 but in the sort - time approximation , the operator can be approximately expressed as split - operator01 @xcite@xmath82it has been proved that the expression is accurate enough for the time being short to the characteristic time .",
    "so the density matrix elements of the reduced density matrix @xmath83 in the basis of operator @xmath84 can be expressed as@xmath85by use of the completeness relation @xmath86 , we have @xmath87where@xmath88and @xmath89similarly , @xmath90where @xmath91 and @xmath92 or @xmath93 are the eigenvalues and eigenstates of operator @xmath94 so we have@xmath95namely,@xmath96 .",
    "\\label{eq25}\\end{aligned}\\]]in the eq.([eq25 ] ) the tr@xmath97 term is same as that in ref.privman",
    ". enlightened by privman s works we can easily obtain@xmath98here , @xmath99and @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102 will affect the decoherence but @xmath103 will not it quantifies purely a shift of the energy levels of the qubit system .",
    "when the summation in eq.([eq27 ] ) is converted to integration in the limit of infinite number of the bath modes , one has@xmath104for the real @xmath105 by using of eq.([eq11 ] ) we can yield a good qualitative estimate of the relaxation behavior @xcite , @xcite . from ref.@xcite",
    "we know the condition of eq.([eq9 ] ) is @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "it is big enough for @xmath50 to take @xmath108 .",
    "thus , in the following numerical simulations we set the cutoff frequency @xmath109 ( the unit is the reciprocal of @xmath110 ) . evaluating eq.([eq26 ] ) we can obtain the evolution of the density matrix elements of the deduce density matrix @xmath111 as@xmath112where @xmath113 , @xmath114 the evolution of the closed qubit is @xmath115 and @xmath116 so we have@xmath117then , we have@xmath118the result is similar but not same to the norm in @xcite where @xmath119 and @xmath120    in the following , we numerically analyze the decoherence . in the following calculation , three pure initial states are chosen , they are @xmath121 ( corresponding to point ) ; @xmath122 ( corresponding to above line ) ; @xmath123 ( corresponding to below line ) , [ because it has been shown that evaluation of the supremum over the initial density operators in order to find @xmath124 see eq.([eq15 ] ) one can do over only pure - state density operators privman ] .",
    "we choose @xmath125 according to @xcite , and @xmath126 in the model the typical impedance of the control line is @xmath127 since @xmath128 y. maklin _",
    "et al_. have suggested a value @xmath129 for numerical@xmath130simulations@xmath17 we plot the norms @xmath66 versus time @xmath131 in fig.1 .",
    "@xmath132it is shown that when the initial state is @xmath133 @xmath134 is the maximum and it equals to @xmath135 ( plotted by points in the figs . ) .",
    "we denote the low decoherence ( @xmath136 ) time @xmath137 from fig.1a we obtain @xmath138 we denote the elementary gate operation time , the characteristic time @xmath139 in this case , @xmath140 .",
    "it is shown that the low decoherence time is larger than the single gate operation time , namely , @xmath141 .",
    "the fact means that within the whole time of elementary gate operation , @xmath142 theoretically , the design can satisfy the divincenzo low decoherence criterion .",
    "a further study shows that when the temperature decreased and the josephson energy @xmath18 increased the qubit can be improved .",
    "it is also shown that the decoherence increase with the increasing of dimensionless strength of the dissipation @xmath143",
    "in this paper we investigated the short - time decoherence of the jcq .",
    "we show schematically the behavior of @xmath144 . it is shown that for a jcq the decoherence derive from the dissipation",
    "is small enough according to the divincenzo criterion .",
    "it has been shown that the decoherence of jcq derive not only from the dissipation but also from the quantum leakage .",
