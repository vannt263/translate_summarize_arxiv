    "the low - energy particle spectrum implies that the chiral symmetry which the qcd lagrangian possesses in the limit of massless quarks is spontaneously broken .",
    "the corresponding order parameter , the chiral condensate , can be related to the pion decay constant through the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation @xcite . on the other hand , the chiral condensate is directly related to the density of the smallest eigenvalues of the dirac operator via the banks - casher relation @xcite .    on the lattice ,",
    "the density of the low - lying eigenvalues of the dirac operator is strongly dependent on the choice of the fermion action .",
    "the staggered fermion action respects a chiral @xmath0 symmetry and , as a consequence , the nonzero eigenvalues of the dirac operator occur in pairs @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the eigenvalues near zero and in the bulk of the spectrum can be distinguished .",
    "the wilson fermion action breaks chiral symmetry explicitly , and there is no @xmath0 symmetry for the hermitian wilson dirac operator .    in this contribution , we will be concerned with universal features in the spectrum of the staggered dirac operator .",
    "we will mainly concentrate on the low - lying eigenvalues since they are particularly relevant for chiral symmetry breaking . the banks - casher relation @xcite , @xmath2 , relates the eigenvalue density , @xmath3 , of the dirac operator at zero virtuality to the absolute value of the chiral condensate , @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the four - volume .",
    "if chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , this relation implies that the spacing of the small eigenvalues is @xmath6 .",
    "since the eigenvalues of the non - interacting dirac operator are spaced like @xmath7 , this means that the dirac eigenvalues in qcd must be strongly correlated .",
    "leutwyler and smilga @xcite derived an effective low - energy theory which is valid in the range @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the linear extent of the box , @xmath10 is a typical hadronic scale , and @xmath11 is the pion mass . in this region , the kinetic terms in the chiral lagrangian can be neglected , and only the symmetries are important .",
    "it was then conjectured by shuryak and verbaarschot @xcite that the distribution of the small dirac eigenvalues , averaged over gauge field configurations , is universal in the sense that it only depends on global symmetries of the dirac operator .",
    "the essential ingredient is the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the qcd vacuum .",
    "given this fact , the statistical properties of the low - lying eigenvalues can be computed in a much simpler theory , e.g. , chiral random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "alternatively , one can use the finite - volume partition function of leutwyler and smilga .",
    "we will not address this point since it is discussed in the contribution by p.h .",
    "damgaard @xcite .    to resolve the low - lying dirac eigenvalues ,",
    "one rescales the energies by a factor of @xmath12 and defines the microscopic spectral density @xcite , @xmath13 this is a typical universal quantity which can be computed in chiral rmt .",
    "other universal quantities are the distribution of the smallest eigenvalue and higher order spectral correlation functions on the microscopic scale @xmath14 .",
    "we note that by concentrating on the low - lying eigenvalues , we are considering a finite - volume effect . in particular , by computing analytical results we hope to learn something about the approach to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "on the lattice , one necessarily has to perform an extrapolation to this limit .",

    "the dirac operator in the continuum is defined as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the gauge field and @xmath17 is the coupling constant .",
    "this operator is anti - hermitian . because of the @xmath0 symmetry @xmath18",

    "the euclidean qcd partition function in a sector of topological charge @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the gluonic action , @xmath26 is the number of quark flavors with masses @xmath27 , and the @xmath28 are the eigenvalues of @xmath19 .",
    "the superscript @xmath29 on @xmath16 means that the path integral is only over gauge fields with fixed topological charge @xmath23 .",
    "the partition function is then given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the vacuum angle .",
    "the basic idea of the random matrix approach is to substitute the matrix @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) by a random matrix @xmath32 , respecting the global symmetries of the problem .",
    "if the dimension of the matrix @xmath32 is @xmath33 , there are @xmath23 exact zero modes .",
    "the rmt partition function reads @xmath34 where the precise form of the distribution , @xmath35 , replacing @xmath36 is unimportant , provided that it is invariant under rotations of @xmath32 and that we are interested in universal properties @xcite . for convenience ,",
    "one often uses a gaussian distribution .",
    "eventually , one is interested in the limit @xmath37 which can be identified with the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the classification of the random matrix ensembles pertaining to different symmetry classes can be found in ref .",
    ". we will discuss staggered fermions with gauge group su(2 ) which are described by the chiral symplectic ensemble ( chse ) of rmt . in this ensemble ,",
    "the elements of @xmath32 are real quaternions . diagonalizing @xmath32 and expressing it in terms of angles and radial coordinates ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath32 can be written as @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the vandermonde determinant .",
    "the main mathematical problem then consists in performing integrations of this expression over all but a few variables @xmath28 in the limit @xmath37 .",
    "to check rmt predictions , one often replaces an ensemble average by a spectral average which is possible due to spectral ergodicity . here , however , we are interested in the low - lying eigenvalues , and a spectral average is not possible .",
    "thus , we need good statistics .",
    "recently , it has become feasible to calculate large ensembles of complete spectra of the staggered dirac operator in su(2 ) @xcite on lattices of size up to @xmath40 , extending the methods developed by kalkreuter @xcite .",
    "we determine the complete spectrum in order to make sure that the distribution of the low - lying eigenvalues has no other numerical uncertainties than the finite precision in 64 bit arithmetic .",
    "our numerical simulations were done on a cray t3e .",
    "the configurations were generated using a hybrid monte carlo algorithm .",
    "the boundary conditions were periodic for the gauge fields and periodic in space and anti - periodic in euclidean time for the fermions .",
    "for the diagonalization of the dirac matrix , we employed the cullum - willoughby version of the lanczos algorithm @xcite . in su(2 ) with staggered fermions , every eigenvalue of @xmath19 is twofold degenerate because of a global charge conjugation symmetry .",
    "in addition , the squared dirac operator @xmath41 couples only even to even and odd to odd lattice sites , respectively .",
    "thus , on a lattice with @xmath42 sites , @xmath41 has @xmath43 distinct eigenvalues .",

    "the data agree with the rmt prediction for topological charge @xmath51 ( an example is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] that the agreement of the data with the rmt result breaks down at some value of the rescaled energy .",

    "a quantitative discussion of this issue will be given in sec .",
    "[ susc ] . from the figures ,",
    "one can see that the range of validity increases with increasing lattice volume and decreasing @xmath55 .",
    "the results obtained in the quenched approximation are very encouraging .",
    "the natural next step is to include the fermion determinants in eq .",
    "( [ eq1.4 ] ) .",
    "now an additional parameter enters the problem , the quark mass ( assuming that we consider degenerate quarks ) .",

    "[ quen ] and sec .",
    "the rmt results were computed with @xmath51 for the reason discussed in sec .",
    "again , there is only one parameter , @xmath12 , which sets the energy scale and is determined by the data from the banks - casher formula .",
    "we have also plotted the rmt results for @xmath67 and @xmath69 in the quenched approximation and in the chiral limit , respectively .",
    "the data should agree with these two curves in the limits @xmath59 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath60 , the data should lie somewhere in between these two limiting curves .",
    "this is indeed observed in the figures .",
    "an important remark is in order .",
    "we are comparing lattice data computed with @xmath71 copies of staggered flavors ( corresponding to @xmath72 flavors in the continuum limit ) with rmt results computed for @xmath26 flavors , where @xmath73 .",
    "this is not an ad - hoc prescription but justified by the combination of the following two reasons .",
    "first , the u(4)@xmath74u(4 ) symmetry of the continuum action ( for @xmath75 ) is broken to u(1)@xmath74u(1 ) at finite lattice spacing @xmath45 .",
    "this would suggest to use @xmath76 in the rmt results .",
    "second , all eigenvalues of @xmath77 are doubly degenerate in su(2 ) .",
    "however , in eq .",
    "( [ eq1.4 ] ) the eigenvalues are assumed to be non - degenerate @xcite .",
    "this would suggest to use @xmath78 in the rmt results . combining the two factors ,",
    "we conclude that we have to use @xmath79 in the rmt results .",
    "note that in the regime @xmath60 , the quark mass is very small , and lattice simulations are very demanding .",
    "testing the rmt predictions required a substantial numerical effort .",
    "however , the point is that , once the validity of the rmt description is established , the availability of analytical results for very small quark mass should facilitate extrapolations to the chiral limit which are otherwise difficult to perform on the lattice .",
    "as indicated above , the domain of validity of the random matrix description is finite .",
    "after all , qcd is a complicated theory and not just a random matrix model .",
    "if one wants to make practical use of the rmt results , one should know quantitatively in which energy range they apply . in condensed matter physics , the energy up to which the rmt description is valid",
    "is called the thouless energy , @xmath80 . essentially , @xmath80 is the inverse of the diffusion time of an electron through a disordered mesoscopic sample .",
    "it behaves like @xmath81 , where @xmath9 is the length of the sample .",
    "recently , some progress was made in identifying the equivalent of the thouless energy in qcd @xcite .",
    "again , we shall concentrate on the low - lying eigenvalues .",
    "the starting point is the condition for the applicability of the leutwyler - smilga effective theory , @xmath82 which also sets the domain of validity of the rmt description . from the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation , we have @xmath83 here , @xmath84 is to be regarded as a valence quark mass which sets the energy scale below which rmt applies . denoting the qcd equivalent of the thouless energy by @xmath85 , one obtains @xcite @xmath86 to have a dimensionless quantity , it is useful to divide @xmath87 by the mean level spacing at @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "this yields @xmath90 this is the prediction which we want to test .",
    "it was already checked in the instanton liquid model and confirmed qualitatively @xcite . since we have a large number of complete spectra at our disposal , we are in a position to perform a comprehensive quantitative test against lattice data . for simplicity ,",
    "we only use the quenched data . in the following , we summarize results obtained in ref .  @xcite .    a convenient quantity to consider in this respect is the disconnected chiral susceptibility . it is defined in terms of the dirac eigenvalues by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the number of lattice sites and @xmath84 is the valence quark mass .",
    "going over to the microscopic limit , i.e. , rescaling all energies by @xmath12 and defining @xmath93 , the susceptibility can be expressed in terms of the microscopic spectral one- and two - point functions . inserting the rmt results of the chse for these quantities and performing some tedious algebra",

    "note that in going from eq .",
    "( [ eq5.5 ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq5.6 ] ) , @xmath97 has been rescaled by @xmath98 to eliminate the dependence on @xmath55 .",
    "the rmt result should agree with the lattice result up to some limiting value @xmath99 . to identify this value ,",
    "it is useful to define the ratio @xmath100 deviations of this ratio from zero indicate the breakdown of the rmt description .",
    "the ratio is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for one particular data set .",
    "the deviations of the ratio from zero for very small values of @xmath101 are artifacts of finite statistics which are explained in ref .",
    "we are interested in the deviations from zero which set in at @xmath102 .",
    "let us denote this value of @xmath101 by @xmath99 .",
    "it is related to @xmath85 by @xmath103 .    according to eq .",
    "( [ eq5.4 ] ) , @xmath99 should scale with @xmath104 .",
    "this prediction is tested in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where we have plotted data for four different lattice sizes at constant @xmath55 versus @xmath105 .",
    "all data fall on the same curve , except for the deviations at small @xmath101 which are due to the finiteness of our statistical ensembles .",
    "this confirms the prediction that @xmath99 scales with @xmath104 .",
    "it remains to test the predicted scaling with @xmath106 . in order to determine @xmath107",
    ", we use a result of ref .",
    "@xcite where it was found that @xmath108 in lattice units in the range of @xmath55 we consider .",
    "this suggests to plot the ratio of eq .",
    "( [ eq5.7 ] ) versus @xmath109 which we have done in fig .  [ fig5 ]",
    ".    again , the data fall approximately on the same curve , in particular the data for @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "( one can only expect an agreement on the level to which the relation between @xmath106 and @xmath4 is known . ) putting in the numbers , we obtain @xmath112 which is in good agreement with the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ eq5.4 ] ) .",
    "another interesting quantity is the number variance in an interval @xmath113 $ ] , defined by @xmath114 .",
    "( this @xmath115 should not be confused with the absolute value of the chiral condensate . ) here , @xmath116 is the number of eigenvalues in @xmath95 , and @xmath117 denotes an ensemble average .",
    "the number variance can be computed in rmt , and the lattice data agree with the rmt result up to some limiting value of @xmath118 which we will denote by @xmath119 . considering a number of different lattice sizes and @xmath55-values we found that @xmath119 scales with @xmath106 and @xmath104 as expected .",
    "quantitatively , @xmath120 which is consistent with @xmath99 .",
    "we conclude this section with the statement that the domain of validity of the rmt description of the low - lying dirac eigenvalues in qcd is now known quantitatively .",
    "the implications of this result will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we now have solid numerical evidence that the distribution of the low - lying dirac eigenvalues is universal and described by rmt results , both in the quenched approximation and with dynamical fermions .",
    "furthermore , we have a quantitative criterion for the domain of validity of the random matrix description which was confirmed by lattice simulations .",
    "how can we make practical use of this knowledge ?",
    "one point concerns extrapolations to limits that are difficult to take on the lattice .",
    "the first example is the thermodynamic limit . since we are dealing with finite - volume effects",
    ", we can make analytical statements about how this limit is approached .",
    "this was already demonstrated in ref .",
    "the second example is the chiral limit .",
    "we have rmt results for the microscopic spectral quantities in the presence of dynamical quarks with arbitrarily small masses . for quantities that are sensitive to the small eigenvalues",
    ", these results should provide guidance for extrapolations to the chiral limit .",
    "third , we have the continuum limit .",
    "it is less clear in what way the random matrix approach might help in approaching this limit .",
    "one observation is that as @xmath121 , there should be a transition in the effective number of flavors used in the rmt results with dynamical fermions , from @xmath122 to @xmath123 .",
    "presumably , @xmath45 has to be very small to see such a transition .",
    "as far as topology is concerned , rmt can determine the microscopic spectral quantities only for fixed topological charge @xmath23 .",
    "the overall result for some quantity will be a weighted average over all topological sectors , and rmt can not predict the weights .",
    "so far , all data were consistent with @xmath51 in the rmt results since the latter are only sensitive to exact zero modes of the dirac operator",
    ". it would be very interesting to identify the would - be zero modes .",
    "for this , one needs the eigenvectors corresponding to the small eigenvalues .",
    "we are currently trying to compute these as well .",
    "last but not least , we feel that the analytical knowledge of the distribution of the smallest eigenvalues may have an impact on fermion algorithms .",
    "this is suggested by the fact that the magnitude of the small eigenvalues determines the performance of the fermion algorithm .",
    "while rmt can not say anything about individual configurations , it predicts the statistical distribution of the small eigenvalues",
    ". this knowledge may be useful to construct more effective algorithms .",

    "<S> we have computed ensembles of complete spectra of the staggered dirac operator using four - dimensional su(2 ) gauge fields , both in the quenched approximation and with dynamical fermions . to identify universal features in the dirac spectrum </S>",
    "<S> , we compare the lattice data with predictions from chiral random matrix theory for the distribution of the low - lying eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement is found up to some limiting energy , the so - called thouless energy , above which random matrix theory no longer applies . </S>",
