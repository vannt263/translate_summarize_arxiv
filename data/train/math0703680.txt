    "a homeomorphism between planar domains @xmath6 is called @xmath1-quasiconformal if it is of class @xmath7 and satisfies the beltrami equation , @xmath8 for almost every @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath1 is the beltrami coefficient , that is , a measurable bounded function with @xmath10 .",
    "more generally , any @xmath7 solution is called @xmath1-quasiregular .",
    "when @xmath11 , we recover conformal mappings and analytic functions , respectively .",
    "+ when @xmath12 for some @xmath13 , then clearly @xmath1-quasiregular mappings are @xmath14-quasiregular @xcite . as holomorphic mappings are linked to harmonic functions",
    ", so are quasiregular mappings with elliptic equations .",
    "in particular , it is well known that if @xmath15 solves ( [ beltrami ] ) , @xmath16 is a solution to    @xmath17    where for almost every @xmath18 , @xmath19 , the space of symmetric matrices with @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 and @xmath5 are related by the formula @xmath21 .",
    "a similar equation holds for @xmath22 .",
    "thus it follows from morrey s work @xcite that @xmath1-quasiregular functions are hlder continuous with exponent @xmath23 , see also @xcite . on the other hand , if the coefficient @xmath1 is more regular , say hlder continuous , then classical schauder estimates tell us that the derivatives of any @xmath1-quasiregular mapping @xmath24 are hlder continuous and , in particular , @xmath24 is lipschitz continuous .",
    "+   + in this paper , we study properties of @xmath1-quasiregular mappings ( and hence to the solutions to the related elliptic equations ) , when the regularity of beltrami coefficient is measured in the category of sobolev spaces @xmath2 .",
    "our study is focussed on the removable singularities and on the distortion of hausdorff measures and capacities under solutions of such @xmath25 .",
    "+   + we say that a compact set @xmath26 is _",
    "removable for bounded @xmath1-quasiregular mappings _",
    "if for every open set @xmath27 , every bounded function @xmath24 , @xmath1-quasiregular on @xmath28 , admits an extension @xmath1-quasiregular in all of @xmath27 . when @xmath11 , this is the classical painlev problem .",
    "it is also a natural question to replace bounded functions by others , such as @xmath29 ( bounded mean oscillation ) , @xmath30 ( vanishing mean oscillation ) or @xmath31 ( hlder continuous with exponent @xmath32 ) .",
    "we want to give geometric characterizations of these sets .",
    "of special interest is the case @xmath33 , which is at the borderline .",
    "+   + by means of the stoilow factorization ( see for instance @xcite ) , one easily sees that the way @xmath1-quasiconformal mappings distort sets is very related to removability problems .",
    "we have the precise bounds for distortion of hausdorff dimension from astala @xcite , which apply to any @xmath14-quasiconformal mapping , @xmath34 in the particular case @xmath35 we also have absolute continuity of measures @xcite , that is , @xmath36 if the coefficient is more regular one improves these estimates as well .",
    "for instance , if the beltrami coefficient @xmath1 lies in @xmath30 , then every @xmath1-quasiconformal mapping @xmath37 has distributional derivatives in @xmath38 for every @xmath39 ( see for instance @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xmath40 for every @xmath41 , and as a consequence , @xmath42 moreover , actually for such @xmath1 one has @xmath43 . +   + however if we further know that @xmath33 we obtain more precise information .",
    "an important reason is the following : we first recall that for @xmath11 we have the well known weyl s lemma , which asserts that if @xmath44 is any ( schwartz ) distribution such that @xmath45 for each test function @xmath46 ( by @xmath47 we mean the algebra of compactly supported @xmath48 functions ) , then @xmath44 agrees with a holomorphic function . in other words , _ distributional _ solutions to cauchy - riemann equation",
    "are actually _ strong _ solutions .",
    "when trying to extend this kind of result to the beltrami equation , one first must define the distribution @xmath49 .",
    "it need not to make sense , because bounded functions in general do not multiply distributions nicely . however , if the multiplier is asked to exhibit some regularity , and the distribution @xmath44 is an integrable function , then something may be done .",
    "namely , one can write @xmath50 whenever each term makes sense .",
    "for instance , this is the case if @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "hence we can call @xmath54 the _ beltrami distributional derivative _ of @xmath24 , and we can say that a function @xmath52 is _ distributionally @xmath1-quasiregular _ precisely when @xmath55 as a distribution . of course , a priori such functions @xmath24 could be not quasiregular , since it is not clear if the distributional equation actually implies @xmath56 .",
    "thus it is natural to ask when this happens .",
    "[ maintheo6 ] let @xmath57 for some @xmath58 , and let @xmath4 be a compactly supported beltrami coefficient .",
    "assume that @xmath59 for any @xmath60 .",
    "then , @xmath24 is @xmath1-quasiregular .",
    "in particular , @xmath61 .",
    "we must point out that this selfimprovement of regularity is even stronger , because of the factorization theorem for @xmath1-quasiregular mappings , as well as the regularity of homeomorphic solutions when the beltrami coefficient is _",
    "nice_. namely , when @xmath4 is compactly supported , it can be shown that any @xmath1-quasiconformal mapping is actually in @xmath62 whenever @xmath63 .",
    "hence , every @xmath64 distributional solution to the corresponding beltrami equation is actually a @xmath62 solution , for every @xmath63 .",
    "further , we can show that the above weyl s lemma holds , as well , when @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "+   + one may use this selfimprovement to give removability results and study distortion problems for @xmath1-quasiconformal mappings .",
    "the conclusions we obtain encourage us to believe that beltrami equation with @xmath67 beltrami coefficient is not so far from the classical planar cauchy - riemann equation .",
    "for instance , we shall show that for any @xmath68 , any set @xmath26 with @xmath69 is removable for @xmath70 @xmath1-quasiregular mappings , precisely as it is when @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this @xmath70 removability problem does not imply in general any result on @xmath1-quasiconformal distortion of hausdorff measures , since there are examples of @xmath4 for which the space @xmath70 is not @xmath1-quasiconformally invariant .",
    "therefore , to get results in terms of distortion we study the removability problem with the @xmath29 norm . then we get that @xmath26 is removable for @xmath29 @xmath1-quasiregular mappings , if and only if @xmath71 .",
    "more precisely , this is what happens for @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath26 is removable for @xmath30 @xmath1-quasiregular mappings if and only if @xmath72 is @xmath5-finite , again as in the analytic case @xcite .",
    "in distortion terms , this reads as @xmath71 if and only if @xmath73 , and @xmath72 is @xmath5-finite if and only if @xmath74 is .",
    "+   + @xmath1-quasiconformal distortion of analytic capacity is somewhat deeper , since the rectifiable structure of sets plays an important role there .",
    "we show in lemma [ muqcrectifiabledistortion ] that if @xmath4 is compactly supported , then @xmath37 maps rectifiable sets to rectifiable sets . as a consequence",
    ", purely unrectifiable sets are mapped to purely unrectifiable sets .",
    "therefore , we get from @xcite our following main result .",
    "[ maintheo7 ] let @xmath4 be a compactly supported beltrami coefficient , and let @xmath37 be @xmath1-quasiconformal . if @xmath26 has @xmath5-finite length , then @xmath75    let s mention that in @xcite tolsa proved that an homeomorphism @xmath37 preserves the analytic capacity of sets if and only if @xmath37 is a bilipschitz map . on the other hand , the radial stretching @xmath76 is not bilipschitz but clearly it preserves sets of zero analytic capacity .",
    "theorem [ maintheo7 ] asserts that @xmath1-quasiconformal mappings , @xmath4 , also preserve sets of zero analytic capacity having also @xmath5-finite length .",
    "+   + as a natural question , one may ask wether these distortion results apply also for compactly supported beltrami coefficients @xmath65 when @xmath66 . in this case , we study the same removability problems and we obtain analogous results .",
    "for instance , if @xmath69 , then @xmath26 is removable for @xmath70 @xmath1-quasiregular mappings , as well as for the analytic case @xcite .",
    "again , this does not translate to the distortion problem for hausdorff measures , since @xmath70 is not quasiconformally invariant . however , this has some interesting consequences in terms of distortion of hausdorff dimension .",
    "namely , it follows that @xmath77 moreover , when letting @xmath78 we get the corresponding @xmath29 and @xmath30 removability problems . due to our weyl type lemma , we show that in this weaker situation @xmath65 , @xmath79 , we actually have absolute continuity of measures , i.e. @xmath80 for any @xmath1-quasiconformal mappig @xmath37 .",
    "this improves the absolute continuity results in @xcite .",
    "+   + we do not know if implication ( [ zerotozerointro ] ) is an equivalence .",
    "indeed , if @xmath79 and @xmath65 then the beltrami coefficient @xmath81 of inverse mapping @xmath82 need not belong to the same sobolev space @xmath2 ( this is true for @xmath83 ) .",

    "now , we are increasing the range of values of @xmath84 for which this holds and , unexpectedly , this length distortion result is also true for @xmath79 .",
    "however , it is not clear a priori if this implication is an equivalence ( as it is when @xmath4 ) . of course , the same can be deduced from the @xmath30 problem . in terms of distortion ,",

    "+   + for the @xmath70 removability problems , we obtain also the same result that for @xmath4 .",
    "although this has no direct implications in terms of distortion of hausdorff measures , for dimension distortion we get the following .      if @xmath463 , then @xmath69 for all @xmath464 , and hence @xmath26 is @xmath1-removable for @xmath32-hlder continuous functions , for every @xmath464 .",

    "+ however , if we restrict ourselves to beltrami coefficients @xmath65 with @xmath197 , then it comes from the remark after proposition [ muinverse ] that the inverse mapping @xmath82 is @xmath81-quasiconformal , for some compactly supported beltrami coefficient @xmath81 satisfying @xmath474 and @xmath475 for some @xmath476 . in other words , if @xmath477 , then @xmath81 belongs to the right range of sobolev spaces , so that all the comments above apply to @xmath82 and we get that both @xmath37 and @xmath82 map zero length sets to zero length sets ( and the same for @xmath5-finite length sets ) .",
    "this means that if @xmath65 is a compactly supported beltrami coefficient , @xmath88 , and @xmath409 is @xmath1-quasiconformal , then implications ( [ zerotozerogeneral ] ) and ( [ finitetofinitegeneral ] ) are actually equivalences .",
    "therefore , @xmath37 is in the situation of lemma [ muqcrectifiabledistortion ] , and rectifiable sets are preserved as well under the action of @xmath37 .",
