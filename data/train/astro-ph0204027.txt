    "solar - type stars typically lose over half their initial main sequence mass on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) before becoming white dwarfs ( habing 1996 ) ; mass loss is of central importance both in stellar evolution and the replenishment of interstellar matter . while many agb stars exhibit approximately spherically symmetric mass loss which can be understood in terms of standard models of the interaction of stellar pulsations and radiation pressure on dust ( lamers & cassinelli 1999 , willson 2000 )",
    ", others show markedly asymmetric outflows which are not well understood . here , we report an investigation to learn more about the circumstellar material around oh 231.8 + 4.2 , a star with a distinctive bipolar outflow .",
    "oh 231.8 + 4.2 appears to be an evolved member of the open cluster m 46 ( jura & morris 1985 ) , and on the basis of the main sequence turnoff from this system , this mass - losing star probably had an initial main sequence mass of about 3 m@xmath5 .",
    "both its cluster membership and  phase - lag \" measurements in the reflection nebulosity ( kastner et al .",
    "1992 ) indicate the distance to the star is approximately 1.3 kpc .",
    "although the star is buried in an optically opaque circumstellar dust cloud , scattering in bipolar lobes perpendicular to the nominal disk indicates the presence of a luminous m9 star ( cohen & frogel 1977 ) .",
    "the star is variable with a period which might be as short as 648 days ( feast et al .",
    "1983 ) or as long as 708 days ( kastner et al .",

    "1998 ) . the luminosity and effective temperature can be explained if the star lies on the agb .    at 60 @xmath0 m ,",
    "oh 231.8 + 4.2 is brighter than every other agb star in the sky except irc + 10216 and the egg nebula ( rafgl 2688 ) ( see jura & kleinmann 1989 , kleinmann et al . 1978 ) .",
    "irc+10216 is very bright at 60 @xmath0 m because its distance is only @xmath2150 pc ; it is not uniquely luminous . for oh 231.8 + 4.2 , however , with an estimated distance of 1.3 kpc , then as found in the edirbe data from the cobe satellite , @xmath7(60 @xmath0 m ) can be as large as 3 @xmath3 10@xmath8 erg s@xmath9 hz@xmath9 which is comparable to that from the egg nebula and , as shown in figure 1 , substantially larger than @xmath7(60 @xmath0 m ) displayed by most other mass - losing agb stars .",
    "the optical and near - infrared morphology of oh 231.8 + 4.2 indicates that there is a massive disk surrounding the central star ( see , for example , kastner al .",
    "additionally , oh 231.8 + 4.2 displays a bipolar outflow at radio and optical wavelengths which is inferred to carry at least 0.3 m@xmath5 ( reipurth 1987 , morris et al .",

    "the bipolar morphology exhibits discrete clumps ( alcolea et al . 2001 ) .",
    "although not directly determined spectroscopically , in order to account for the bipolar morphology , a plausible assumption is that oh 231.8 + 4.2 is a binary and thus the outflow may be very flattened ( mastrodemos & morris 1999 , soker & rappaport 2000 , soker 2002 ) .",
    "the nature of the putative companion is unknown .",
    "it is unlikely that the companion is a white dwarf since oh 231.8 + 4.2 does not exhibit any spectroscopic similarity to symbiotic systems .",
    "the dynamical nature of the disk is not known .",
    "is the matter expanding radially outwards from the star or is it gravitationally bound and orbiting the star , as appears to be the case for some other evolved red giants with circumstellar envelopes such as the red rectangle ( jura & kahane 1999 ) ? in order to learn more about oh 231.8 + 4.2 , we have obtained high angular resolution mid - ir images of this system with the keck i 10 m telescope .",

    "many other studies have focused on the large scale bipolar outflow ; here we concentrate on the inner region of the system .",
    "our data were obtained on 2001 feb 05 ( ut ) at the keck i telescope using the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) which was built by a team led by b. jones and is described on the keck web page .",

    "the extended infrared emission which was reported by meixner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) shows the same orientation in the sky as the bipolar lobes detected at other wavelengths .",
    "there is also a central unresolved point - like source .",
    "we measure total fluxes of f@xmath1(11.7 @xmath0 m ) = 27 jy and f@xmath1(17.9 @xmath0 m ) = 240 jy .",
    "these fluxes are about 50% greater than the average values determined by iras of f@xmath1(12 @xmath0 m ) = 19 jy and f@xmath1(25 @xmath0 m ) = 226 jy .",
    "oh 231.8 + 4.2 is strongly variable at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the dirbe instrument on the cobe satellite measured mean fluxes of f@xmath1(12 @xmath0 m ) = 72 jy and f@xmath1(25 @xmath0 m ) = 680 jy .",
    "thus our measured fluxes are within the range given by previous observations .",
    "if the pulsational period given by kastner et al . ( 1992 ) has remained stable , then our data were obtained near minimum light .",
    "both the cobe and iras beams are much larger than the angular resolution that we obtained , but the fluxes reported with these instruments may still be comparable to our results since we detect emission as far as 2@xmath12 from the central source . at this angular offset , we expect the grain temperature to have fallen to 170 k ( see below ) and thus there would probably be relatively little extended emission beyond this region at 11.7 @xmath0 m and even 17.9 @xmath0 m .",
    "we find that the unresolved central sources carry about 1/3 and 1/4 of the total flux at 11.7 @xmath0 m and 17.9 @xmath0 m , respectively , so that within the unresolved core , f@xmath1(11.7 @xmath0 m ) = 9 jy and f@xmath1(17.9 @xmath0 m ) = 60 jy .",
    "it is notable that oh 231.8 + 4.2 does display a bright unresolved central source .",
    "other stars with ratios of f@xmath1(25 @xmath0m)/f@xmath1(12 @xmath0 m ) @xmath11 10 in the iras data , indicative of cold grains , show distinct shells and no central dust source .",
    "for example , hd 179821 , with f@xmath1(25 @xmath0m)/f@xmath1(12 @xmath0 m ) = 21 shows a resolved shell with an inner diameter of about 33 ( jura & werner 1999 ) . in hd 179821 ,",
    "the weak 12 @xmath0 m emission results from few grains being near the star . in the case of oh 238.1 + 4.2",
    ", there are a large number of grains near the star yet the material is relatively cold .",
    "the infrared emission from oh 231.8 + 4.2 depends in part upon the composition and size of the grains . here , we first consider the possibility that the grains are sufficiently small that the emissivity of the particles varies as @xmath13 and that the envelope is optically thin . in this case , the average temperature of the grains , @xmath14 can be estimated implicitly from the formula : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond to 11.7 @xmath0 m and 17.9 @xmath0 m , respectively . with @xmath18 = 0.15 ,",
    "then @xmath14 @xmath19 120 k. if the grains act like black bodies , then @xmath14 @xmath19 135 k is a better fit to the data .",
    "if the material is opaque , then the observed flux , f@xmath1 , is given by the expression : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the planck function and @xmath22 the solid angle of the source .",
    "since the flux at 17.9 @xmath0 m from the innermost 05 is 60 jy , the minimum black body temperature of the grains which emit this radiation is 130 k.    in the simplest of optically thin models ( see sopka et al .",
    "1985 ) , if the grain opacity varies as @xmath23 , then the temperature of the dust grains , @xmath14 , at a distance @xmath24 from the star can be computed from the expression : @xmath25 given that oh 231.8 + 4.2 has spectral type m9 , we adopt @xmath26 = 2500 k ( van belle et al .",
    "1996 ) . with an average value of @xmath27 = 1.5 @xmath3 10@xmath6 l@xmath5 , then @xmath28 = 4.6 @xmath3 10@xmath29 cm .",
    "since the central source is unresolved , we expect that all the emission from the point source arises from a region within 025 of the star which corresponds to a distance of 4.9 @xmath3 10@xmath4 cm . at this distance , the predicted grain temperature from equation ( 3 ) for @xmath30 = 1 ( a crude averaging of the silicate opacity given by david & pegourie 1995 ) is 290 k , much greater than the value inferred from the data .",
    "even if the particles are black bodies with @xmath30 = 0 , then the grain temperature is predicted to equal 170 which is larger than the inferred value .    a better way to understand",
    "the data is to presume a nonspherical circumstellar envelope where much of the mass is largely confined to a disk .",
    "knapp , sandell & robson ( 1993 ) showed that a flat opaque disk can not explain the spectral energy distribution from oh 231.8 + 4.2 because in the infrared , such a disk should exhibit f@xmath1 varying as @xmath31 while , in fact , between 12 @xmath0 m and 60 @xmath0 m , the iras data indicate that f@xmath1 varies as @xmath32 .",
    "below , we consider a flared disk which , when viewed face - on , exhibits f@xmath1 varying as @xmath33 ( chiang & goldreich 1997 ) .",
    "we suggest that emission from a flared disk at a substantial inclination can account for the data .",
    "we can make an estimate of the minimum dust mass in the compact source , @xmath34 . if it were optically thin , then @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the distance to the source .",
    "if , as is likely , the system is opaque , then this relationship only provides a lower bound to @xmath34 . with @xmath14 = 130 k , f@xmath1(17.9",
    "@xmath0 m ) = 60 jy and @xmath37 = 1000 @xmath38 g@xmath9 ( ossenkopf , henning & mathis 1992 ) , then @xmath34 @xmath11 7 @xmath3 10@xmath39 g.",
    "in order to explain the spectral energy distribution of the unresolved source , we present a model to explain the observations of oh 231.8 + 4.2 which is based on the calculations by chiang & goldreich ( 1997 ) for passive , opaque disks around pre - main sequence stars .",
    "although we consider a post - main sequence system , the basic physical principles can be applied to both sorts of disks . in this model ,",
    "the heating and cooling rates locally balance each other , and the task is to determine the temperature which achieves this effect .",
    "we ignore the illumination of the disk by light from the bipolar lobes .    if the disk has a local temperature , @xmath40 , then in a flat system which is optically thick in the vertical direction , for @xmath24 @xmath41 @xmath28 , @xmath42 for a disk in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium which is locally isothermal , the density distribution , @xmath43 , is given by the expression @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath0 is the mean molecular weight . in this expression , we ignore the self - gravity of the disk .    the transition from flat to flared disk occurs at a critical distance , @xmath46 , which is established by the criterion that @xmath47 @xmath11 @xmath28 . from the above , @xmath48 and at this location , the temperature , @xmath49 , is given by the expression : @xmath50 using the stellar parameters for oh 231.8 + 4.2 described above , assuming that @xmath51 = 1 m@xmath5 because the star has lost mass during its post - main sequence evolution , and assuming that the gas is primarily h@xmath52 and he so that @xmath0 = 3.9 @xmath3 10@xmath53 g , then @xmath54 = 0.061 .",
    "consequently , @xmath46 = 3.0 @xmath28 so that the flaring of the disk begins close to the star . at @xmath24",
    "= @xmath46 , the disk temperature , @xmath49 , is 740 k.    in their models for flared disks , chiang & goldreich ( 1997 ) define the  grazing angle \" , @xmath55 , as the angle between the surface of the disk and the line of sight to the star .",
    "far from the star , @xmath56 in this approximation , @xmath57 with these expressions , the disk temperature is given by the expression : @xmath58    chiang & goldreich ( 1997 ) discuss models for pre - main sequence stars whose disks result from the collapse of interstellar clouds .",
    "such disks might have very large amounts of angular momentum and extend to great distances from the star . here , we picture a disk created in a binary system , and the initial angular momentum of the system limits the amount of angular momentum , @xmath59 , that the disk can possess .",
    "below , we argue that the disk has an angular momentum given by : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the outer boundary of the disk which we set equal to 3 @xmath62 where these parameters are defined below ( see equation 18 ) .",
    "if oh 231.8 + 4.2 had , itself , an initial mass of 3 m@xmath5 and a companion of 1 m@xmath5 in a circular orbit of radius between 3 and 5 au , then the companion would have had an orbital angular momentum of @xmath22 @xmath3 10@xmath63 g @xmath38 s@xmath9 .",
    "if half of this orbital angular momentum has been transferred to the disk so that @xmath59 @xmath2 10@xmath63 g @xmath38 s@xmath9 , and if @xmath64 @xmath2 0.1 m@xmath5 , we find from equation ( 13 ) that @xmath61 = 6 @xmath3 10@xmath4 cm , consistent with the observational upper limit that @xmath61 @xmath65 5 @xmath3 10@xmath4 cm . according to our models , where @xmath61 = 5 @xmath3 10@xmath4 cm , the inferred disk temperature from equation ( 12 ) is 130 k and @xmath47 = 3 @xmath3 10@xmath4 cm .",
    "if the disk were nearly face - on - then we would detect emission from essentially every annular ring .",
    "however , if the angle between the normal to the disk and the line of sight , @xmath66 , is greater than 45@xmath10 , then the inner , warm portions of the disk are occulted ( chiang & goldreich 1999 ) . according to kastner et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and shure et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , @xmath66 @xmath19 54@xmath10 , and therefore most of the disk is shadowed from our point of view . as a first approximation",
    ", we assume that we only observe emission from the outer portion of the flared disk which has radius , @xmath61 , and a uniform temperature , @xmath67 .",
    "this outer material is so  flared \" into our line of sight that its emission dominates the unresolved central source that we detect . if @xmath68 denotes the solid angle subtended by the outer portion of the flared disk from our perspective , then @xmath69 we can use equation ( 2 ) to estimate the flux from the source .",
    "the comparison of the model with the data is shown in figure 4 where we present the results for both @xmath61 = 3 @xmath3 10@xmath4 cm ( and @xmath67 = 130 ) and an alternative model with @xmath61 = 3 @xmath3 10@xmath4 cm ( and @xmath67 = 160 k ) . the model with @xmath61 = 5 @xmath3 10@xmath4 cm agrees with our observations of the compact emission at 11.7 @xmath0 m and 17.9 @xmath0 m to better than a factor of 2 .",
    "our model does not reproduce the total flux from the system since our observations show that the bipolar lobes contribute the majority of the flux from oh 231.8 + 4.2 at 17.9 @xmath0 m and 11.7 @xmath0 m .",
    "the results from the model suggest that much of the millimeter and submillimeter continuum are produced by the compact source .",
    "this is possible but unproven .",
    "we do not know the millimeter - wavelength opacity of the particles around oh 231.8 + 4.2 , and the disk may not be fully opaque at these wavelengths from the perspective of the earth .",
    "in fact , the model significantly overestimates the flux at the longest observed wavelength of about 3 mm .",
    "the apparent agreement between the model and many of the integrated millimeter and submillimeter fluxes shown in figure 4 may be a coincidence . also , at 4.9 @xmath0 m , the observed dirbe flux is 16 jy which agrees with ground - based measurements ( woodward et al .",
    "1989 ) and , furthermore , this is the total flux expected from the photosphere .",
    "the map of woodward et al .",
    "( 1989 ) shows that the emission at 4.7 @xmath0 m is extended and much of it is probably scattered radiation .",
    "the amount of disk thermal emission at wavelengths shortward of 11.7 @xmath0 m is not easily measured and is therefore not included in figure 4 .",
    "the model proposed here is geometrically similar to that proposed by cohen et al . ( 1985 ) .",
    "what is uncertain is whether the disk material is expanding radially or whether it is orbiting ; the expansion rate is not well measured .",
    "it has usually been assumed that the disk is expanding radially at the characteristic outflow speed of 20 km s@xmath9 . at this speed",
    ", the material reaches the inferred value of @xmath61 of 5 @xmath3 10@xmath4 cm in approximately 80 yr . if , however , the disk is in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium then the vertical sound crossing time must be short compared to the expansion time . in the outermost region , the disk temperature may be @xmath2100 k and therefore possess a sound speed near 1 km s@xmath9 .",
    "since the vertical displacement approaches 5 @xmath3 10@xmath4 cm , the time to achieve vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and thus the implied disk lifetime is at least @xmath22 @xmath3 10@xmath70 years .",
    "it is easier to understand the presence of a flared disk if the material is orbiting .",
    "pringle ( 1991 ) has presented a model for how viscous disks around binary stars may expand as angular momentum is transfered from the binary stars into the disk , and here we follow his model . in the standard treatment of accretion disks , matter flows inwards while angular momentum flows outwards .",
    "pringle ( 1991 ) argues that for a circumbinary disk , the binary system can provide enough torque to the disk so that no matter flows inwards , but the outward flow of angular momentum still occurs . in this model , after the disk is formed , its mass remains constant .",
    "the torque operates as the binary creates a tide in the circumbinary disk ( lin & papaloizou 1979 ) .",
    "we assume that the circumstellar matter is injected into the system as a narrow ring of mass , @xmath64 , and an inner radius , @xmath71 .",
    "the ring then expands as angular momentum is transferred from inner to outer regions by viscosity , @xmath72 , which can be written as @xmath73 here , @xmath55 is the usual dimensionless parameter and is taken to be @xmath65 1 , @xmath74 is the speed of sound or ( @xmath75)@xmath76 where @xmath77 is the ratio of specific heats , and @xmath78 is the local angular velocity of the disk , @xmath79 .    following pringle ( 1991 ) , we make the approximation that the gas temperature falls as @xmath80 so that @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the temperature at the inner boundary of the disk , @xmath71 .",
    "this radial variation of the temperature is somewhat different from that described in equation ( 12 ) , but it should not lead to any essential change in the physics of the outflow . it does allow for a simple analytic solution to the asymptotic disk evolution . following pringle , with this radial variation of the temperature , we define @xmath83 [ denoted @xmath84 by pringle ] as a characteristic speed of the outflow induced by the viscosity , such that @xmath83 = @xmath85 , and is given by the expression : @xmath86 because @xmath87 scales as @xmath80 , @xmath83 is independent of @xmath24",
    ".    the inner radius of the disk might be @xmath21.7 times greater than the orbital separation of the binary pair ( artymowicz & lubow 1994 ) .",
    "although uncertain , we adopt @xmath71 = 3 @xmath28 = 1.3 @xmath3 10@xmath88 cm where @xmath40 = 740 k ( see above ) .",
    "the value of @xmath55 is not well known for the material around oh 231.8 + 4.2 .",
    "saslaw ( 1978 ) has shown that grains around a variable star move in non - circular orbits , and these non - circular motions might produce a substantial viscosity .",
    "we assume that @xmath55 = 1 implying that @xmath83 = 0.29 km s@xmath9 .",
    "after the initial conditions damp out , pringle s model for the outer portion of the disk has a surface density given by the expression : @xmath89 where @xmath64 is the mass of the disk .",
    "this expression for the surface density of the disk appears to be independent of the torque being exerted on the disk because the transfer of angular momentum from the binary to the disk is effected by employing the inner boundary condition of the solution for the disk evolution that no matter flows inwards even though matter and angular momentum flow outwards .",
    "that is , at all times , the mass of the disk is constant and : @xmath90 the disk angular momentum , @xmath59 , is given by : @xmath91 from equation ( 18 ) , we write that @xmath61 @xmath19 3 @xmath92 .",
    "according to pringle ( 1991 ) , the characteristic time for the torque to operate on the disk , @xmath93 , at the innermost radius , is given by the expression : @xmath94 thus , for the disk around oh 231.8 + 4.2 , this characteristic time for the torque to operate is @xmath2 200 years .",
    "the outflow time is @xmath95 or about 5000 yr .",
    "therefore , the time for the torque to be effected is considerably less than the inferred outflow time .",
    "alcolea et al .",
    "( 2001 ) derive a minimum age of the bipolar outflow from oh 231.8 + 4.2 of 770 years . thus the time noted here for the flared disk to expand to its current estimated size",
    "is comparable to the minimum lifetime of the system .",
    "we have suggested that the circumstellar disk around oh 231.8 + 4.2 is gravitationally bound and orbiting the system rather than simply undergoing a radial expansion .",
    "underlying this picture is that oh 231.8 + 4.2 is an agb star with a hitherto - unseen companion .",
    "ignace , cassinelli & bjorkman ( 1996 ) have suggested that mass loss from a red giant with a sufficiently large rate of rotation  perhaps induced by a companion ( livio & soker 1988 )  could produce a disk material within a few stellar radii of the mass - losing star . whether this disk is bound or unbound  that is , whether it is orbiting or expanding  is not easily calculated because the acceleration law of the material near the star is not known .",
    "in fact , the acceleration may be time - variable over several pulsational cycles ( winters et al .",
    "although it is possible that an orbiting ring could be formed near a rotating agb star , this is unproven .",
    "once such a ring is formed , as discussed above , pringle ( 1991 ) has proposed that the material could expand by the viscous dissipation of angular momentum contained within the orbiting central binary .",
    "although there are a large number of studies of the molecular gas around oh 231.8 + 4.2 , there is no direct kinematic demonstration from observations of the circumstellar gas that the disk around oh 231.8 + 4.2 is orbiting .",
    "most of the gas emission is dominated by material in the bipolar flow which subtends a solid angle of @xmath2 10@xmath96 ster .",
    "the flared disk probably only subtends a solid angle of @xmath2 10@xmath97 ster .",
    "therefore , the disk emission is mostly overwhelmed by the extended emission from the bipolar flow , and in order to detect the disk , interferometry is required .",
    "one molecule which has been extensively studied at high angular resolution is oh . a remarkable aspect of oh 231.8 + 4.2 is that the centroid of the oh maser emission is offset about 1 to the southwest from the sio and h@xmath52o masers and the millimeter continuum ( gomez & rodriguez 2001 , zijlstra et al .",
    "2001 , sanchez - contreras et al .",
    "one possibility is that since oh is produced from the photodissociation of h@xmath52o ( glassgold 1996 ) , a one - sided ultraviolet flux might produce a one - sided concentration of oh , as might explain the co profile toward hd 188037 ( jura et al .",
    "since m46 with its concentration of ultraviolet - emitting a - type stars also lies to the southwest of oh 231.8 + 4.6 , we suggest that the displacement of the oh masers from the core of oh 231.8 + 4.6 may be a consequence of its position in the outer , northeast portion of m46 .",

    "this orientation suggests that this emission may be excited in the bipolar flow rather than the disk .    on a scale of 0005 ,",
    "desmurs et al . ( 2001 ) report sio maser emission which is in the east - west direction and with kinematics which are consistent with being infalling material at a speed of @xmath210 km s@xmath9 with some additional rotation at a speed , @xmath100 , of @xmath26 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the inferred rotation is measured over a spatial scale of approximately the diameter of the star .",
    "unless the system is nearly face - on , the apparent rotation is too small to be orbital motion ; it must reflect rotation of the star .",
    "the total angular momentum of an agb star is about @xmath101 ( soker 1998 ) ; oh 231.8 + 4.2 may currently possess @xmath2 10@xmath102 g @xmath38 s@xmath9 of angular momentum .",
    "above , we suggest that the disk may possess @xmath2 10@xmath63 g @xmath38 s@xmath9 of angular momentum .",
    "thus , it is imaginable that there might be enough angular momentum in the system to account for the proposed disk .",
    "we conclude that the available interferometric data are consistent with the hypothesis of an orbiting disk with an outer radius of 5 @xmath3 10@xmath4 cm , but they do not lend any support to the model . the argument for the existence of an orbiting rather than expanding",
    "disk is indirect . while the predicted infrared emission from a flared",
    ", orbiting disk agrees with our data , we can not rule out other models for the compact , mid - infrared emission .    the mass of the disk around oh 231.8 + 4.2 is uncertain .",
    "above we derived a minimum mass of dust of 10@xmath103 g which would correspond to a total of about 0.01 m@xmath5 if the gas to dust ratio is @xmath2160 .",
    "the maximum possible dust mass is about 1.0 m@xmath5 since this would require that most of the material lost by oh 231.8 + 4.2 was trapped in the disk .",
    "however , a disk of this mass could not be both orbiting and as large as 5 10@xmath4 cm because it would possess too much angular momentum .",
    "it is possible that the disk around oh 231.8 + 4.2 has about 0.1 m@xmath5 . in this case",
    ", the disk mass around oh 231.8 + 4.2 is larger than that for disks around other evolved red giants except , perhaps , the red rectangle ( see jura & kahane 1999 ) . with time , the circumbinary disk around oh 231.8 + 4.2 must evolve . if , in fact , the material is orbiting , then macroscopic solids and even planets might eventually form .",
    "we have obtained 11.7 @xmath0 m and 17.9 @xmath0 m images of oh 231.8 + 4.2 ; we identify an unresolved central source with f@xmath1(17.9 @xmath0 m ) = 60 jy .",
    "we propose that this emission results from a flared disk with an outer temperature of 130 k and an outer disk radius of 5 @xmath3 10@xmath4 cm .",
    "one possible model that is consistent with the data is that this flared disk is orbiting rather than simply expanding .",
