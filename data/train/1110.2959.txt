    "the experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have given clear indications of the formation of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "one way to probe the qgp is to exploit the high energy jets ( @xmath6 ) produced by the hard collisions at the initial stage .",
    "they are internal probes propagating through the fireball and interacting with the medium losing energy , hence carrying information on its properties as proposed long ago in ref.s @xcite .",
    "this energy loss can be quantified by the suppression of observed hadron spectra at high transverse momenta @xmath7 , namely @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "altough the observation of the jet suppression can not be questionated there are several fundamental questions that still remain open.to investigate them we have constructed a model to study two observables beyond the @xmath1 .",
    "one is the elliptic flow @xmath8 , that gives a measure of the angular dependence of quenching , and the other is @xmath9 that determines the flavor dependence of the suppression .",
    "we suggest that the study of the correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath11 carry information on the temperature dependence of the quenching and on the mechanism of parton flavor conversion.we find that an energy loss that increase as @xmath12 , the @xmath13 in - medium conversion and an expansion - cooling of the fireball according to a lattice qcd eos improve the agreement with the experimental data . even if the t dependence that has to be considered in the present modeling including only path - lenth energy loss appear to be too extreme .",
    "in the model the density profile of the bulk is given by the standard glauber model while the hard parton distributions in momenta space are calculated in the next - to - leading- order ( nlo ) pqcd scheme .",
    "for the hadronization the albino - kramer - kniehl ( akk ) fragmentation functions have been employed . for further details",
    "see ref . @xcite . with regard to the jets energy loss we have employed various schemes , however to make a connection to the large amount of effort to evaluate gluon radiation in a pqcd frame , we have used also the gyulassy - levai - vitev ( glv ) formula at first order in the opacity expansion @xcite :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the casimir factor equal to 4/3 for quarks and 3 for gluons",
    ", @xmath16 is the strong coupling , @xmath17 is the local density , @xmath18 the proper time , @xmath19 is the energy of the jet and @xmath20 is the screening mass .",
    "there are corrections to eq.([eq.glv ] ) coming from higher order that can be approximately accounted for by a rescaling z factor of the energy loss .",
    "however this is not really relevant for the objectives of the present work because we will renormalize the energy loss in order to have the measured amount of suppression @xmath1 for central collisions .",
    "usually in the glv , as well as in other approaches , the temperature evolution of the strong coupling @xmath16 is discarded .",
    "we will consider the impact of such a dependence to understand the amount of @xmath21 dependence coming simply from the asymptotic freedom . in the right panel of fig.[fig - raa - centr ] we show by dot - dashed and dashed lines the temperature dependence of the energy loss for the glv with a dependence of the coupling(glv-@xmath22 ) and with a constant coupling @xmath23 ( glvc ) .",
    "furthermore we show two other opposite cases for @xmath24 : the thick line that shifts the energy loss to lower temperature ( hence low density @xmath25 or entropy density @xmath26 ) as suggested in @xcite and the other ( thin line ) that gives a dominance of quenching at high @xmath21 , considered here just for comparison respect to the opposite case .     at 200 agev @xcite .",
    "right panel : temperature dependence of the energy loss for a parton with transverse momentum @xmath7 equal to 10 gev . dashed and dot - dashed lines represent the glv energy loss with constant and t dependent @xmath16 coupling ( see text ) .",
    "the thick line is the case in which the energy loss takes place only closer to the phase transition and the thin line represents an opposite case in which the energy loss take place only at high temperature t.,title=\"fig:\",width=6,height=5 ]   at 200 agev @xcite .",
    "right panel : temperature dependence of the energy loss for a parton with transverse momentum @xmath7 equal to 10 gev . dashed and dot - dashed lines represent the glv energy loss with constant and t dependent @xmath16 coupling ( see text ) .",
    "the thick line is the case in which the energy loss takes place only closer to the phase transition and the thin line represents an opposite case in which the energy loss take place only at high temperature t.,title=\"fig:\",width=6,height=4 ]    we have applied our modelling of the jet quenching to au+au collisions at 200 agev and in the left panel of fig.[fig - raa - centr ] we can see that , once the @xmath1 at @xmath27 is fixed , the dependence on centrality is correctly predicted with a glv formula for both constant and t - dependent @xmath16 . hence looking at @xmath28 one",
    "is not able to clearly discriminate the temperature dependence of the quenching and not even the details of the density profile @xcite .",
    "generally , jet quenching modeling has not been able to simultaneously describe @xmath29 and the elliptic flow @xmath2 . in particular ,",
    "experimental data relative to @xmath2 are considerably larger than theoretical prediction .",
    "we have explored the relation between the temperature dependence of quenching and the value of the elliptic flow and in the left panel of fig.[v2_wood ] we can see that even if the amount of total quenching has been fixed to the experimental value of @xmath1 the amount of elliptic flow is strongly dependent on the temperature dependence of the @xmath30 .",
    ".the shaded area shows the experimental data@xcite .",
    "right panel : ratio of quark to gluon @xmath29 for the different t dependence of the energy loss as shown in the right panel of fig.[fig - raa - centr ] .",
    "the shaded area approximatively shows the value expected for the ratio according to experimental observations and using the akk fragmentation function , title=\"fig:\",width=245,height=188 ] .the shaded area shows the experimental data@xcite .",
    "right panel : ratio of quark to gluon @xmath29 for the different t dependence of the energy loss as shown in the right panel of fig.[fig - raa - centr ] .",
    "the shaded area approximatively shows the value expected for the ratio according to experimental observations and using the akk fragmentation function , title=\"fig:\",width=245,height=5 ]    this correlation is due to the fact that at variance with @xmath1 the @xmath10 has a longer formation time because the jets have to explore the shape of the fireball to realize its asymmetry.therefore it seems to be quite likely that experiments are telling us that quenching does not take place mainly at the very early time ( temperature ) of the collision but mainly at later times close to the phase transition.this would mean that the quenching is not proportional to the density ( or entropy density ) but a decreasing function of it with a maximum at @xmath31 .",
    "this is what is essentially discussed also in ref.s@xcite where however it was implicitely assumed that the amount of quenching of quarks and gluons are equal among them and to the hadronic one .",
    "here we have modified such assumptions showing that the temperature ( or entropy density ) dependence of @xmath30 modifies not only the @xmath10 but also the relative amount of quenching of quarks and gluons .      due to its su(3 ) lie algebra the energy loss of gluons is @xmath32 larger than the quark one . for this reason",
    "sometimes it is assumed that the ratio between the quark and gluon suppression ( @xmath9 ) is equal to @xmath32 . from this one",
    "would think that the ( anti-)protons are more suppressed respect to pions because they come more from gluon fragmentation than from quarks fragmentation respect to pions , at least according to the akk fragmentation function we employ . the data at rhic however have shown that even outside the region where coalescence should be dominant @xcite the protons and the antiprotons appear to be less suppressed than the pions and @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "again we can see that going beyond the simple amount of quenching given by @xmath1 both the azimuthal dependence and the flavor dependence of the quenching appear to be in disagreement with the data .",
    "we call this open issues the `` azimuthal '' and the `` flavor '' puzzle respectively",
    ". we will show that even if @xmath28 for central collisions is fixed to be @xmath34 the @xmath9 is significantly affected by the temperature dependence of @xmath30 .",
    "+ in the right panel of fig.[v2_wood ] we show the ratio of the @xmath9 for four different temperature dependences of the energy loss @xmath30 , as in fig.[fig - raa - centr ] ( right ) .",
    "we can see that the standard glvc energy loss does not give the expected ratio @xmath32 for @xmath9 but a lower value , around 1.8 , which represents already a non negligible deviation from 2.25 .",
    "we can however see that if the energy loss would be strongly t dependent and dominant in the @xmath31 region @xmath35 can increase up to about 2.2 on the contrary , if it is dominant in the high temperature region ( thin solid line ) the @xmath9 can become as small as 1.5 .",
    "+ to understand this behavior is useful to consider the left panel of fig.[fig - rapporto - deltae ] where the transverse momentum distribution of initial parton and those obtained if all partons lose the same amount of energy ( 3 gev and 4 gev in the dotted and dot - dashed line , respectively ) are shown .",
    "the effect of the quenching in this oversimplified case is to shift the spectra by a quantity equal to the amount of energy loss in a way indicated by the black arrow . because of the rapid falling distribution the spectra after quenchig are in these cases one order of magnitude smaller respect to the initial one .",
    "therefore the @xmath36 of the spectrum without quenching , indicated by the thin line , is comparable to the spectrum in the case of @xmath30= 3 - 4 gev .",
    "this means that if there are particles that lose a very small quantity of energy , like in the case of quenching at high temperature , they strongly influenced the final spectra for both quarks and gluons and damping the difference between the @xmath29 of quarks and gluons . for energy loss dominated by low temperature all particles",
    "lose energy and this increases the difference between the respective @xmath29 .",
    "a similar effect could come not only from the t - dependence of @xmath30 but from a core - corona effect @xcite .",
    "for further explanations see ref .",
    "@xcite .     and the elliptic flow of pions with transverse momentum in the range @xmath37 .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=245,height=188 ]",
    "we have seen ( fig . [ v2_wood],left and right panel ) that an energy loss predominant at low t move @xmath2 toward observed data but move also the ratio @xmath39 away from experimental indications .",
    "this is evident if one looks at the upper symbols of fig.[fig - rapporto - deltae ] ( right ) where @xmath39 vs @xmath40 is shown . to solve the `` flavor puzzle '' inelastic collisions that cause a change of the flavor",
    "has been invoked @xcite .",
    "such a process would at the end produce a net conversion of quarks into gluons .",
    "hence a decrease of gluon suppression respect to the original suppression and an increase of the quark one . in ref.@xcite",
    "it has been calculated the conversion rate of a quark jet to a gluon jet and vice versa due to two - body scatterings .",
    "an enhancement factor @xmath41 that accounts for non - perturbative effect is needed to produce a nearly equal suppression of quarks and gluons.we have included such a mechanism in our model .",
    "the results are the lower symbols in the right panel of fig 3 .",
    "we can see that the @xmath42 conversion does not affect the @xmath2 and allows to get closer to the experimental observed value , i.e .",
    "a @xmath43 and an @xmath44 ( to account for the @xmath45 with akk fragmentation function ) .",
    "as a last point , we have observed that if the quenching is predominant near the phase transition the question of the corret equation of state arises .",
    "in fact the free gas approximation is no longer a reasonable approximation just close to @xmath4 .",
    "we have made some explorative studies on the impact that a more correct equation of state ( eos)can have on the correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath8 . making a fit to the lattice qcd data @xcite we have obtained the following relation between density and temperature @xmath46 where @xmath47 with @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 and of course for @xmath51 one gets @xmath52 . in order to estimate the impact of this correction we have performed a simulation for the @xmath53 behavior represented by the thick solid line in the right panel of fig.[fig - raa - centr ] , which is similar to the delayed energy loss proposed by pantuev @xcite as a solution for the observed large elliptic flow .",
    "we consider only this case because it is of course the one that is much more affected by the modification implied by eq.([rho - t - lqcd ] ) .",
    "the results are given by open symbols in the right panel of fig.[fig - rapporto - deltae].respect to the free gas expansion cooling the system spends more time at @xmath31 .",
    "this reflects in a further enhancement of both @xmath10 and efficency of the @xmath13 conversion moving the two observables closer to experimental data ( shaded area in fig.[fig - rapporto - deltae ] ( right ) )    as a last point we want to mention the issue of the efficiency of conversion of initial spatial asimmetry @xmath54 into a @xmath2 , namely the @xmath55 . in the left panel of fig.[v2_eccenticit ] we show the different values of @xmath55 that one obtains through the simple path - length mechanism studied with our modeling , noticing that it is at maximum @xmath56 . in the right panel of fig .",

    "this seems to indicate that a proper treatment of elastic energy loss can give an important constribution at least at intermediate @xmath57 gev where presently the experimental data on @xmath2 are available .     as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath7 of pions produced in collision with impact parameter equal to @xmath58 fm for different temperature dependence of the energy loss , as shown in the right panel of fig .",

    "moreover we have spot the relevance that the @xmath59 may have in case of @xmath30 dominant in the @xmath31 region . in any case our study , although already revealing several interesting indications , is mainly explorative and it can be considered as a benchmark . a more quantitative analysis should be performed with more sophisticated models that include the energy loss fluctuations , realistic gain and loss processes , elastic energy loss and a more accurate description of the bulk .",
    "furthermore it should be explored if mass dependent formation time can affected the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
