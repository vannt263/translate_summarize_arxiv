    "this set - up is particularly important because alice and bob do not necessarily need entanglement sources or quantum memories . instead , single - photon sources or weak coherent pulse sources are sufficient .",
    "this set - up resembles the measurement - device independent qkd protocol proposed in @xcite .",

    "the advantage of a multiplexing protocol occurs at time @xmath19 where bsms are performed such that the number of connections is maximized . in the case of furmp",
    "this corresponds to performing as many bsms such that one array of quantum memories is completely empty . in the case of firmp",
    "the maximal number of connections can be found using the _ maximum cardinality bipartite matching _",
    "@xcite , i.e. the maximum number of edges in a given bipartite graph such that each vertex has at most one neighbor .",
    "this problem can be explicitly formulated as follows : there is a list of filled quantum memories on the left .",
    "each quantum memory on the left may be connected to several quantum memories on the right , depending on the maximal connection length .",
    "this defines a bipartite graph . by solving the maximum cardinality bipartite matching algorithm",
    "we find the maximal number of possible connections .",
    "in the case of full - range multiplexing the optimal matching will always leave one of the two arrays completely empty .",
    "this is not the case with finite - range multiplexing .",

    "the chosen matching can have an influence on the final state fidelity due to memory decoherence .",

    "this quantity identifies the amount of decoherence that has been experienced by the older quantum memory .",
    "this is a meaningful quantity because one of the two involved quantum memories is always fresh .",

    "strategy 1 connects pairs which arrived with a short time difference giving as a result the highest correlations which are possible to produce at a certain time .",
    "the disadvantage is that older pairs remain in the memories and therefore are used at a later time , having experienced decoherence for a long time .",
