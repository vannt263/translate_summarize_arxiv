    "sx phoenicis stars are population ii pulsating variable stars with shorter periods ( @xmath7 ) and larger amplitudes of variability , compared with @xmath8 scuti stars which are short period pulsating variable stars belonging to population i. interestingly most of known sx phoenicis stars in globular clusters are located in the blue straggler star ( bss ) region in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "it is long since the presence of the bss in the globular cluster m3 became known by @xcite .",
    "now there are many bss discovered in the globular clusters and open clusters in our galaxy and in the fields of nearby galaxies . however , the origin of the bss is still controversial .",
    "the bsss are hotter and brighter than the main sequence turn - off stars so that it is needed some mechanisms to make the stars hotter and brighter ( more massive ) to explain the origin of the bss .",
    "there have been suggested two classes of mechanisms to explain the origin of the bbs .",
    "one class involves a single star where mixing in the atmosphere can increase the life time of the main sequence .",
    "the other class is based on merger process where two low - mass stars are merged to form a more massive unevolved star via mass transfer or direct collisions between stars .",
    "these days the latter is preferred @xcite . recently",
    "a significant fraction of the bss in globular clusters are known to be sx phoenicis stars .",
    "the presence of these pulsating variable stars ( as well as eclipsing variables ) among the bss provides an excellent opportunity to understand the origin of the bss , because we can investigate physical properties and processes of the stars in more detail compared with the case of non - variable stars .",
    "therefore the study of sx phoenicis stars can provide us with important clues on the origin of the bss .",
    "it is only after 1980 s that sx phoenicis stars were discovered in the globular clusters . since the first discovery of sx phoenicis stars in the globular cluster @xmath9 centauri @xcite",
    ", the discovery rate of these stars in the globular clusters has increased rapidly in the last decade , using the intermediate - to - large telescopes .",
    "recently , many sx phoenicis stars are being discovered in several globular clusters and nearby galaxies .",
    "some examples are @xmath9 centauri @xcite , m5 @xcite , m15 @xcite , m22 @xcite , 47 tuc @xcite , and m55 @xcite .",
    "@xcite listed a total of 122 sx phoenicis stars belonging to 18 globular clusters and 27 stars in two external galaxies , covering information published until january , 2000 .",
    "however , the characteristics of the sx phoenicis stars have not yet been fully explained by the present stellar evolution theories , requiring further investigation in observation and theory .",
    "in addition , sx phoenicis stars are known to show period - luminosity ( p - l ) or period - metallicity - luminosity ( p-[fe / h]-l ) relation , which can be a very useful distance indicator for globular clusters and nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the number of known sx phoenicis star in a given globular cluster is small and most studies use an inhomogeneous sample based on different sources . therefore there is seen a large variation among these relations . for example , @xcite derived a slope of 3.7 , while @xcite obtained a much flatter slope of 2.9 .",
    "in 1999 we began time series ccd photometry to search for variable bsss in globular clusters using the 1.8 m telescope at the bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory ( boao ) in korea .",
    "generally we can detect sx phoenicis type stars brighter than @xmath10 mag for 200 seconds exposures , depending on the seeing condition . for larger amplitude variable stars such as w uma type eclipsing binaries",
    ", the detecting magnitude reaches 20.2 mag for the same exposures .",
    "the first result of our survey was discoveries of an sx phoenicis star @xcite and two w uma type variable stars @xcite in the globular cluster m15 .",
    "in this paper we present the result of our survey for short period variable stars in the metal - poor globular cluster m53 .",
    "m53 ( ra=13@xmath11 12@xmath12 55@xmath133 , dec=+18@xmath14 10@xmath15 09@xmath16 , j2000.0 ; @xcite ) has a very low metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath17 , a low interstellar reddening @xmath18 , and an apparent @xmath19 distance modulus @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "many blue straggler stars are known to exist in m53 @xcite .",
    "some of these blue stragglers are expected to be sx phoenicis stars , but no sx phoenicis stars have been reported yet @xcite . here",
    "we report a discovery of eight sx phoenicis stars in this cluster .",
    "this paper is composed as follows .",
    "observations and data reduction are described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 presents the light curves of the new sx phoenicis stars in m53 and section 4 discusses the characteristics of these stars , including the pulsation modes and the period - luminosity relation .",
    "finally primary results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "we obtained time series ccd images of m53 for eleven nights from march 12th , 1999 to april 1st , 2001 .",
    "a total of 45 and 381 frames were obtained for @xmath20 and @xmath19 bands , respectively . because the observations were performed under various seeing condition , we adjusted exposure times depending on the seeing .",
    "the observation log is listed in table 1 .",
    "the ccd images were obtained with a thinned site 2k ccd camera attached to the boao 1.8 m telescope .",
    "the field of view of a ccd image is @xmath21 ( @xmath22 pixel@xmath23 ) at the f/8 cassegrain focus of the telescope .",
    "the readout noise , gain and readout time of the ccd are 7.0 @xmath24 , 1.8e @xmath25adu and 100 seconds , respectively .",
    "a greyscale map of a @xmath19-band ccd image is shown in figure 1 .",
    "it shows only south - east region ( @xmath26 ) of the cluster , out of the total observed field of @xmath21 .",
    "eight new sx phoenicis stars are represented by circles and labeled from sxp1 to sxp8 .      using the iraf / ccdred package , we processed the ccd images to correct overscan regions , trim unreliable subsections , subtract bias frames and correct flat field images .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were obtained using the point spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry routine in the iraf / daophot package @xcite .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes of the stars in m53 were transformed to the standard system using the @xmath27 standard stars @xcite observed on the photometric night of march 30 , 2000 . in figure 2",
    "we plotted cmds for a total of about 18,000 stars on the ( @xmath19,@xmath28 ) plane .",
    "the left panel in figure 2 shows the cmd for a central region at r@xmath291@xmath30 , and the right panel shows the cmd for an outer region at r@xmath311@xmath320 . on the right panel , the main sequence ( ms ) ,",
    "the red giant branch ( rgb ) and the horizontal branch ( hb ) are clearly seen .",
    "in addition , there are about 100 stars at the brighter and bluer region above the ms turnoff ( represented by a box ) , which are blue stragglers .",
    "large scatters shown in the left panel cmd for r@xmath331@xmath30 are due to crowding , so that we could not find any variable stars at @xmath341@xmath30 .",
    "we applied the ensemble normalization technique @xcite to normalize instrumental magnitudes between time - series ccd frames .",
    "we used about a hundred normalizing stars ranging from 137 to 178 for the @xmath19-band and from 137 to 185 for the @xmath20-band , except for variable stars and central stars at r @xmath33 10 where the crowding is severe . for @xmath20-band data ,",
    "we use them only for obtaining mean magnitudes , because the data quality was not good enough to apply frequency analysis .",
    "the normalization equation is @xmath35 where @xmath20 , @xmath19 , and @xmath36 are the standard and instrumental magnitudes of the normalizing stars , respectively .",
    "@xmath37 is the zero point and @xmath38 is the color coefficient . @xmath39 and @xmath40 are used to correct position - dependent terms such as atmospheric differential extinction and variable psf .",
    "after photometric reduction of the time - series frames , we inspected luminosity variations for about 18,000 stars to search for variable stars . > from the variable star search we discovered eight new sx phoenicis stars and recovered about tenth of previously known rr lyrae stars . here",
    "we report only the results on the sx phoenicis stars .",
    "detailed results on the rr lyrae stars will be presented in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "the mean magnitudes and color indices of the sx phoenicis stars are listed in table 2 .",
    "the r.a.(j2000.0 ) and decl.(j2000.0 ) coordinates of the stars in table 2 were obtained from the astrometry using the guide star catalogue ( version 1.1 ) .",
    "interestingly all the new sx phoenicis stars are located in the south - east direction from the center of m53 .",
    "we checked any possible systematic errors preventing us from finding variable stars in other region of the field , but finding none .",
    "the coordinates , mean magnitudes and color indices of the eight new sx phoenicis stars are listed in table 2 .",
    "figure 3 displays @xmath19-band light curves of eight new sx phoenicis stars .",
    "because sxp3 is located near the cluster center and sxp4 close to the ccd edge , some data of sxp3 were lost by poor seeing and some data of sxp4 by daily variation of observing field center .",
    "the light curves in figure 3 show typical characteristics of sx phoenicis stars , i.e. , short periods and low amplitudes .",
    "we have performed multiple - frequency analyses to derive the pulsating frequencies of the eight sx phoenicis stars , using the discrete fourier transform and linear least - square fitting methods @xcite .",
    "figure 4 displays the power spectra the eight sx phoenicis stars we derived .",
    "small inner panels in figure 4 represent the pre - whitening processes .",
    "we searched for one to three pulsating frequencies for each star at the frequency region from 5 to 70 cycles day@xmath23 .",
    "low frequencies detected for the sxp1 , sxp3 , sxp4 and sxp8 might have resulted from variable seeing condition and/or drift during long observing runs from 1999 to 2001 .",
    "synthetic light curves obtained from these analyses are superimposed on the data in figure 3 , fitting the data well .",
    "the results of the multiple - frequency analyses for the eight sx phoenicis stars are summarized in table 3 . in table 3",
    ", we accepted as intrinsic pulsating frequencies with their amplitude signal - to - noise ratios larger than 4 @xcite except for a frequency @xmath41 of sxp2 .",
    "although the amplitude signal - to - noise ratio of sxp2 , 3.8 , is slightly smaller than 4 , its @xmath41 seems to be a harmonic frequency of @xmath1 .",
    "the periods of primary modes for these sx phoenicis stars range from 0.0385 days to 0.0701 days , and the semi - amplitudes of the variability range from 0.030 mag to 0.118 mag .",
    "* sxp1 : * sxp1 has the longest primary period of 0.0701 days among the eight new sx phoenicis type stars of m53 .",
    "this star has two frequencies , @xmath42 cycles day@xmath23 and @xmath43 cycles day@xmath23 .",
    "this star might be a mono - periodic pulsator , because the second frequency @xmath2 seems to be caused by 1 cycle day@xmath23 alias effect of a harmonic frequency of @xmath1 , @xmath44 cycles day@xmath23 , in figure 3 , the light curves of sxp1 shows an asymmetric sinusoidal feature , which is the characteristic of harmonic frequencies .",
    "the maximum amplitude of sxp1 is estimated to be @xmath45 0.292 mag .",
    "* sxp2 : * light curves of this star in figure 3 show an amplitudes change from day to day , implying the excitation of multiple pulsating frequencies .",
    "we derived two closely separated frequencies of @xmath46 cycles day@xmath23 and @xmath47 cycles day@xmath23 , with a ratio of @xmath0 .",
    "these frequencies can be explained by excitation of non - radial modes .",
    "pulsations with non - radial modes were found in several recent observational results of the sx phoenicis stars : sx phoenicis itself @xcite , bl cam @xcite , v3 in 47 tuc @xcite , sxp1 in m15 @xcite , and ten sx phoenicis stars in m55 @xcite .",
    "after these two frequencies are pre - whitened , the third frequency is detected at @xmath48 cycles day@xmath23 , which might have resulted from 1 cycle day@xmath23 alias effect of @xmath49 cycles day@xmath23 .",
    "even if the amplitude signal - to - noise ratio for the third frequency is only 3.8 , the light curves of sxp2 show asymmetric sinusoidal feature , supporting the existence of harmonic frequencies . the maximum amplitude of sxp2",
    "is estimated to be @xmath45 0.372 mag , which is the largest value among the eight sx phoenicis stars in m53 .",
    "* sxp3 , sxp4 , sxp5 , sxp6 , sxp7 : * we could detect only a primary frequency for these five stars .",
    "primary frequencies and the maximum amplitudes of sxp3 , sxp4 , sxp5 , sxp6 and sxp7 are @xmath5020.8796 , 20.0114 , 22.9880 , 22.6000 and 24.1024 cycles day@xmath23 and @xmath45 0.204 , 0.138 , 0.082 , 0.200 and 0.194 mag , respectively . in figure 4 sxp4 and sxp5",
    "show some hints for the existence of harmonic frequencies above 40 cycles day@xmath23 , but they are not conclusive .    * sxp8 : * sxp8 has the shortest primary period of 0.0385 days and the smallest semi - amplitude of 0.030 mag among the eight sx phoenicis stars of m53 .",
    "sxp8 shows a typical feature of low amplitude @xmath8 scuti stars ( lads ) , i.e. , the feature of complicated oscillation pattern and several frequencies compared to one or two stable frequencies of high amplitude @xmath8 scuti stars ( hads ) .",
    "we could detect three frequencies with amplitude signal - to - noise ratios over 4.0 , although the data are not excellent .",
    "the primary , secondary and third frequencies are @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 cycles day@xmath23 , respectively .",
    "in figure 5 , we show the position of the eight new sx phoenicis stars in the color - magnitude diagram of m53 .",
    "all the sx phoenicis stars discovered in m53 are found to be located in the blue straggler region , brighter and bluer than the main sequence turnoff point .",
    "it is interesting that all of them are located in the red side in the bss region of m53 .",
    "this indicates that the pulsational instability strip may cover only a part of the bss region ( a hotter region in this case ) and that only those ( or some of them ) in this region can start pulsation .",
    "it is not yet known why some bsss pulsate and some do not in the same pulational instability region .",
    "it needs further studies using several globular clusters with sx phoenicis stars .    in figure 6",
    "we have compared the @xmath19-amplitudes and periods of the sx phoenicis stars in m53 with those of sx phoenicis stars and @xmath8 scuti stars in other globular clusters and field sx phoenicis stars .",
    "the sources of the data in figure 6 are @xcite for field sx phoenicis stars and @xmath8 scuti stars , and @xcite for sx phoenicis stars in galactic globular clusters .",
    "figure 6 shows that the @xmath19-amplitudes and periods of the eight sx phoenicis stars ( star symbols ) are consistent with those for other sx phoenicis stars in globular clusters .",
    "the @xmath19-amplitudes of the sx phoenicis stars are much larger than those of @xmath8 scuti stars with the same period , and the periods of the sx phoenicis stars the shortest end .",
    "the period - luminosity ( p - l ) relation of sx phoenicis stars in the globular clusters can be very useful for estimating the distances to the clusters and nearby galaxies . however , it is not easy to derive the p - l relation from the observations , because there are often seen a mixture of different pulsation modes in the sx phoenicis stars .",
    "different pulsation modes of the sx phoenicis stars follow different p - l relation ( offsets in the zero points ) .",
    "it is well known that observational identification of the pulsation modes of the sx phoenicis star is difficult in general .",
    "mcnamara ( 1997 , 2000 , 2001 ) suggested that the light amplitude and the degree of asymmetry of the light curves might be useful parameters in deciding the pulsating modes of the high amplitude stars .",
    "mcnamara ( 2000 ) showed that most of the known sx phoenicis stars at the fundamental mode show large amplitude ( for example , larger than 0.15 mag in the case of sx phoenicis stars in @xmath9 centauri ) and asymmetric light curve .",
    "however , not all of the sx phoenicis stars with large amplitude are at the fundamental mode , as shown by mcnamara ( 2000 ) . on",
    "the other hand,@xcite pointed out `` amplitudes generally yield no definitive clues for the identification of modes , except that large amplitudes are more likely to occur in radial pulsations '' . another possible way of identifying the pulsating modes is to use the period - luminosity relations and the period ratios of the sx phoenicis stars in globular clusters , being applied in this study .",
    "in figure 7 we display the period and mean @xmath19 magnitude relation for the sx phoenicis stars in m53 in comparison with other globular clusters and theoretical models .",
    "several interesting features are seen in figure 7 .",
    "figure 7(a ) illustrates that six sx phoenicis stars in m53 show a very good correlation between the period and mean @xmath19 magnitude , while the other two stars ( sxp2 and sxp8 ) are in the higher mode than the others .",
    "sxp1 , the brightest in the sample , has a period much longer than the rest of the sx phoenicis stars . this star is considered to be a member of m53 for three reasons : first , it is seen inside the blue straggler region in the color - magnitude diagram ; secondly , it is located closer to the center of m53 in the sky than sxp4 which is clearly a member of m53 ; and thirdly , it has period and @xmath19 magnitude consistent with those of other sx phoenicis stars in m53 .",
    "we derive a period - luminosity relation using these six stars with @xmath3 < -1.15 $ ] : @xmath54 with an rms scatter of 0.038 .",
    "this result corresponds to @xmath5 for an adopted distance modulus of @xmath6 ( harris 1996 ) .    in figure 7(a ) we compare the sx phoenicis stars in m53 and ngc 5466 .",
    "the results for ngc 5466 were also obtained using the same procedures as for m53 from the similar data so that they can be compared directly with those of m53 @xcite .",
    "we adopted distance modulus of @xmath55 and zero foreground reddening for ngc 5466 @xcite .",
    "it is shown clearly that the p - l relation of the sx phoenicis stars in ngc 5466 agrees very well with that of m53 .",
    "the p - l relation for ngc5466 has a slope very similar to that for m53 and a zero point slightly brighter than that for m53 .",
    "most of the sx phoenicis stars in ngc 5466 are considered to be at the fundamental pulsating mode ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "therefore it is concluded that all sx phoenicis stars ( except for sxp2 and sxp8 ) in m53 are probably at the fundamental pulsating mode",
    ". then sxp2 and sxp8 are probably at the first overtone mode and at the second overtone mode , respectively .",
    "interestingly the amplitudes of sx phoenicis stars in ngc 5466 are much larger than those of m53 stars .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in @xcite .    in figure 7(b ) we compare the sx phoenicis stars in m53 and m55 where as many as 24 sx phoenicis stars were discovered recently by @xcite .",
    "we adopted distance modulus of @xmath56 @xcite and foreground reddening of @xmath57 for m55 @xcite .",
    "note that @xcite derived , using the hipparcos data for sx phoenicis star itself , a distance modulus , @xmath58 , which is very similar to the value given by @xcite , @xmath59 .",
    "@xcite used sx phoenicis stars in m55 to estimate the slope of the p - l relation and used hipparcos data for sx phoenicis star itself to calibrate the zero point , deriving a p - l relation for the fundamental mode : @xmath60 .",
    "figure 7(b ) shows that the p - l relation for m53 agrees approximately with that for the fundamental mode of sx phoenicis stars in m55 and that the scatter of the p - l relation for m53 is much smaller than that for m55 .    in figure 7(c )",
    "we compare the sx phoenicis stars in m53 and @xmath9 centauri where as many as 34 sx phoenicis stars were discovered by @xcite . using the data for @xmath9 centauri , @xcite derived steep p - l relations for the fundamental mode and first overtone mode , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "we adopted distance modulus of @xmath63 and foreground reddening of @xmath64 for @xmath9 centauri given recently by @xcite who used a detached eclipsing binary in @xmath9 centauri .",
    "these values are very similar to those in @xcite , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "figure 7(c ) shows that the p - l relation for m53 agrees approximately with that for the sx phoenicis stars in @xmath9 centauri which were considered to be at the first overtone mode by @xcite ( called a - sequence hereafter ) .",
    "note that the steep slope for the first overtone mode in @xmath9 centauri is based on the data for the period range of @xmath67 , where five stars at the fundamental mode in m53 show a similar behavior .",
    "the sx phoenicis stars at the fundamental mode in @xmath9 centauri ( called b - sequence hereafter ) are 0.4@xmath680.5 mag fainter than those in m53 .",
    "this result is very intriguing and the reasons for this discrepancy are not clear .",
    "@xmath9 centauri has been known to be a very unique globular cluster among the galactic globular clusters in several aspects : it is the most massive globular cluster in the milky way ; it has multiple stellar populations with a wide spread in metallicity from [ fe / h]=2.0 to  0.6 dex ( the metallicity of the main population is [ fe / h ] @xmath69 dex ) ; and it has a very elongated structure .",
    "these features lead to a suggestion that it may be a remnant core of dwarf spheroidal galaxy which formed via merging of several components ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this peculiarity of @xmath9 centauri may be related with the fact that it is the only cluster where more first overtone mode sx phoenicis stars were found than the fundamental mode stars ( or in comparable number ) .",
    "note that much fewer first overtone mode stars were found than the fundamental mode stars in globular clusters .",
    "we checked several possibilities to understand this puzzling result : ( 1 ) if the a - sequence and the b - sequence are , respectively , indeed first overtone mode and the fundamental mode as considered by @xcite ( and if the p - l relation of sx phoenicis stars is universal ) , then the distance modulus of either @xmath9 centauri or m53 must be wrong by as much as 0.4@xmath680.5 mag .",
    "this is very unlikely , considering the good agreement among the different estimates of the distance to these objects ; ( 2 ) the a - sequence may be fundamental mode rather than first overtone mode .",
    "then it is not possible to explain the existence of the b - sequence without assuming that the b - sequence is another fundamental mode behind the a - sequence .",
    "this is also unlikely for the same reason as ( 1 ) ; ( 3 ) the a - sequence and the b - sequence may not be two independent modes .",
    "instead both may belong to the same fundamental mode with a large dispersion .",
    "this is contrary to the result given by @xcite .",
    "however , it happens to be consistent with the theoretical p - l relation for the fundamental mode given by @xcite , as shown in figure 7(d ) .",
    "therefore this problem remains to be explained by further studies .    in figure 7(d ) we compare the p - l relation for m53 with empirical relations given by @xcite and with theoretical relations given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the slope of the p - l relation for the fundamental mode of m53 is very similar to those in theoretical ones ( 3.05 @xcite and 3.14 @xcite ) .",
    "the six sx phoenicis stars in m53 are located at the right side of the blue edge of the fundamental mode relation given by @xcite , consistent with the conclusion that these stars are indeed the fundamental modes . on the other hand ,",
    "the zero point of the m53 relation is about 0.4 mag brighter than that of the theoretical relation given by @xcite .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is not known at this moment .",
    "the empirical p - l relations given by @xcite ( @xmath70 @xmath71 ) are steeper than those for m53 and the theoretical relations given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we present time - series @xmath72 ccd photometry of the metal - poor globular cluster m53 .",
    "we have discovered eight new sx phoenicis type stars ( labeled from sxp1 to sxp8 ) .",
    "physical parameters of these stars are summarized in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "all the new sx phoenicis stars are located in the blue straggler star region of a color - magnitude diagram of m53 .",
    "one of these stars ( sxp2 ) is found to have very closely separated pulsation frequencies : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are primary and secondary frequencies .",
    "this may be due to excitation of non - radial modes .",
    "considering the position in the period-@xmath19 magnitude diagram , six of these sx phoenicis stars are identified to be pulsating at the fundamental mode , and sxp2 and sxp3 are probably at the first overtone and second overtone modes .",
    "we derive a period - luminosity relation for the fundamental mode for the period range of @xmath73 < -1.15 $ ] : @xmath4 with an rms scatter of 0.038 , corresponding to @xmath5 for an adopted distance modulus of @xmath6 ( harris 1996 ) .",
