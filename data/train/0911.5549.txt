    "recently , much attention has been focused on the study of higher - dimensional spacetimes in relation to ideas of ads / cft correspondence @xcite and braneworld @xcite . in the context of the topics ,",
    "higher - dimensional black hole spacetimes would play crucial roles . in the braneworld scenarios , since matter fields are confined on the four - dimensional membrane while the gravity propagates in all dimensions , the observation of phenomena related to the gravity is the only way to see the existence of extra - dimensions . for this reason , physical properties in the strong gravitational field around higher - dimensional black holes should be illuminated to explore the higher - dimensional spacetime .",
    "a typical exact solution of a higher - dimensional rotating black hole is a generalization of the kerr metric found by myers and perry @xcite , and the solution was extended to the kerr - ads black hole solution @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been found that there are several black holes which have a variety of the horizon topology such as black strings and black rings ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it has been recognized that the higher - dimensional black holes possess richer properties than the four - dimensional black holes .",
    "though there are differences in properties of black holes in four - dimensions and in higher dimensions , it is known that the kerr - ads black holes in general dimensions have a remarkable common property , that is , separation of variables in the geodesic hamilton - jacobi equation @xcite .",
    "this is because the kerr - ads black hole metrics in general dimensions admit rank-2 killing tensor fields .",
    "a geodesic particle plays an important role as a probe of black hole spacetime because it gives us information of the geometry around the black hole .",
    "in addition to a particle , a string is regarded as a probe of geometry of a higher - dimensional black hole .",
    "it has been also found that separation of variables in the hamilton - jacobi equation for the stationary strings occurs in the kerr - ads metric @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study dynamics of a namu - goto string in five - dimensional spacetimes .",
    "we consider a special string that we call a _ toroidal spiral string _",
    "@xcite , which has a spiral shape along a circle on a time slice .",
    "the toroidal spiral string is a cohomogeniety - one string @xcite associated with the killing vector field which generates a combination of two commutable rotational isometry .",
    "here we discuss dynamics of the toroidal spiral string in the kerr - ads background , and examine the separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation for the string .    in particular , we study  strings , which are in a special class of the toroidal spirals .",

    "we show that separation of variables occurs for the hopf loop in the kerr metric with two independent rotations , and in the kerr - ads metric with the equal rotations in five - dimensions .",
    "we also analyze dynamics of the hopf loop in the latter black hole metrics , and general toroidal spirals in five - dimensional flat metric , where the separation of variables occurs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : two ] , we briefly review the formalism of a cohomogeneity - one string . in sec.[sec : three ] , we introduce the toroidal spiral strings in the five - dimensional kerr - ads black hole spacetime , and study the separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation corresponding to the nambu - goto equation for the string . in sec.[sec : four ] , we show that complete separation of variables occurs for the hopf loop strings in two cases of the black hole geometry and discuss dynamical properties of the hopf loops in the five - dimensional black holes .",

    "the separability is owing to the existence of a rank-2 killing tensor field on the quotient space with the effective metric .",
    "we have demonstrated the dynamical properties of the hopf loop strings in the kerr - ads background with equal angular momenta . because of high symmetry of the metric , the dynamics is determined by radial motion of geodesic particle in the quotient space . by using the effective potential for the radial motion , we have shown that there exist bounded orbits and unbounded orbits in the quotient space , and there exist the innermost or outermost stable orbit .",
    "the motions of hopf loops are driven by three forces : tension of string , the centrifugal force , and force of gravity @xcite , and the orbits are determined by the competition of these forces .",
    "the stationary solutions are achieved by the balance of these forces .",
    "the existence of the bounded orbits of the hopf loops around five - dimensional black holes makes us recall the geodesic particles around a four - dimensional black hole .",
    "we have also shown that the hamilton - jacobi equation is completely separable for the general toroidal spiral strings in the five - dimensional minkowski background if we choose appropriate coordinates .",
    "we have presented the general dynamical solution of the toroidal spiral strings .",
    "the stationary toroidal spirals have been given in the ref.@xcite , and generalization in less symmetric case is discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we have presented another generalization to dynamical toroidal spirals in this paper",
    ".    it would be easy to replace the five - dimensional black holes with other target spacetimes which admit two commutable rotational killing vector fields .",
    "toroidal spiral strings in black rings are interesting targets of next study .",
