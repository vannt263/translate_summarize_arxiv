    "galaxy clusters have been used to make inferences about cosmology using a number of different approaches @xcite .",
    "one of these is to use the number of clusters as a function of redshift to measure cosmological parameters , most notably the matter density relative to critical , @xmath0 , and the amplitude of the power spectrum of density fluctuations on small scales , @xmath1 .",
    "cluster samples can be selected using the optical richness @xcite , x - ray luminoisity @xcite and the flux of the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on cluster surveys selected using the sz effect but much of what we say can be applied to the other observables .    the sz effect @xcite is the inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons as they pass through the hot intracluster gas along the line - of - sight between the observer and the last scattering surface of the cmb .",
    "see @xcite for a review of properties of the sz effect .",
    "the key feature in the context of constraining cosmological parameters is that the sz flux is directly proportional to the integrated gas pressure and this is expected to be @xcite and observed to be @xcite an excellent proxy for the total mass of the cluster .",
    "large samples of clusters selected via the sz effect are presently being accumulated using the atacama cosmology telescope ( act , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the south pole telescope ( spt , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the _ planck _ satellite @xcite .",
    "these have been used to constrain cosmological parameters and notably in @xcite a discrepancy between the measured values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from clusters and the primary cmb @xcite has been identified . in order to make further progress , two things are necessary .",
    "firstly , the understanding of the relationship between sz flux and the total mass of a cluster needs to be better understood . in addition , much larger samples of clusters need to be used to reduce the statistical uncertainties and this requires much more extensive knowledge of cluster redshifts . at present",
    "this creates a bootleneck in the process since each cluster has to be targetted individually with follow - up observations .",
    "large - scale surveys , such as panstarrs , des , lsst and euclid might amelioarate this over significant regions of the sky , but even then it is likely that there will not be complete redshift coverage .",
    "the objective of this paper is to develop a simple method for dealing with samples of clusters for which there is a fraction of objects ( up to @xmath2 , say ) with missing redshifts .",
    "the simplest possible idea would be to assume that the observed redshift distribution of clusters is that of the overall sample and multiply up the observed numbers so as to get the total number of clusters correct . however , this is too strong an assumption .",
    "the procedure we propose is to allow clusters whose redshifts are not known to be chosen from a statistical ensemble depending on cosmology .",
    "clearly this will lead to some increase in the statistical errors bars , but this can be traded off by the reduction in the sample size that would be necessary to obtain a pure sample .",
    "we will discuss this in the context of simulated surveys that are designed to be similar to those being performed by act , spt and _ planck_. in addition , it may be that there is some selection effect associated with the follow - up campaign , resulting in a systematic difference in the counts for known and unknown samples .",
    "if the selection effect is known then it can easily be corrected within the proposed method . however",
    ", this may not necessarily be the case and we discuss the impact of making an incorrect assumption .",
    "we write the predicted number of galaxy clusters as a function of redshift for a given survey as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the solid angle element , @xmath5 is the volume element , and @xmath6 is the mass function .",
    "the limiting mass @xmath7 describes the selection function of the survey . using the sz signal as a mass proxy , this",
    "can be related to a limit in flux density @xmath8 .",
    "a more realistic sz selection function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is expressed in terms of a limit in detection significance as a function of the size of the cluster and the position in the sky .",
    "however , such a detailed description is beyond the scope of this paper .    by defining @xmath9 suitable redshift bins , of width @xmath10 ,",
    "we can write the predicted number of clusters in the @xmath11-th bin as @xmath12 which depends on cosmology .    the likelihood we use is    @xmath13 , \\label{cash}\\ ] ]    which gives the probability of finding @xmath14 clusters in each of @xmath9 bins given an expected number of @xmath15 , assuming they follow a poisson distribution @xcite .",
    "when appropriate , other likehood functions can be used to account for additional effects , such as spatial correlations between galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "computing the likelihood , being that of eq .",
    "( [ cash ] ) or a more general one , requires that all redshifts in the catalogue are known .",
    "let us now assume that this is not the case , i.e. , the catalogue contains @xmath16 clusters , of which @xmath17 have redshifts and @xmath18 do not .",
    "the minimal strategy ( adopted by @xcite ) is to multiply the distribution of known redshifts by @xmath19 and use it as @xmath20 .",
    "this assumes that the distribution of missing redshifts is exactly the same as the known ones , which would not take into account any possible statistical uncertainty .",
    "another concern is that this strategy underestimates the error bars , which are proportional to the number of clusters in the catalogue .",
    "both issues were negligible in @xcite , as there was only one missing redshift out of 189 ( @xmath21 ) ; however , here we want to deal with larger fractions of missing redshifts .",
    "an improvement over this minimal strategy would be to use the sub - sample with known @xmath22 to estimate the redshift distribution of the full sample by means of resampling techniques , such as bootstrap methods ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this strategy would capture statistical uncertainties ; however , propagating the uncertainty on the resulting estimate of the full distribution to the cosmological parameters would still be an outstanding issue .",
    "the approach we advocate avoids this problem by modelling the corrections directly into the likelihood function .",
    "we modify the likelihood of eq .",
    "( [ cash ] ) to be : @xmath23 \\label{cashnew2}\\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the @xmath25-th version of the catalogue counts obtained by complementing the @xmath17 known redshifts with a random realization of the @xmath18 unknown redshifts .",
    "we stress that , although in this work we are using the likelihood in eq .",
    "( [ cash ] ) , it would be straightforward to modify any likelihood function in the same way . in practice , at a given point in the cosmological parameters space we average the probability corresponding to different catalogue counts , where the missing redshifts are randomly generated . if we consider a large enough number of realizations @xmath26 , the likelihood becomes close to deterministic .    as a distribution for drawing the @xmath18 missing redshifts we can use the ( normalised ) theoretical counts , @xmath27 , corresponding to the cosmological parameters that are currently being sampled .",
    "we note that this does not depend on the fiducial cosmology . in sect .",
    "[ sec : modelling ] we introduce a modification to this simple recipe that can be used to account for systematic effects .",
    "we can interpret the average over the probability in eq .",
    "( [ cashnew ] ) as a marginalisation over different versions of the catalogue .",
    "such marginalization correctly inflates the error bars for the cosmological parameters according to the uncertainty in the redshift distribution of clusters . with respect to simply rescaling the distribution of known redshifts",
    ", we get more realistic error bars and reduce possible biases , because we are making a milder assumption on the distribution of missing redshifts .    in this work",
    "we do not address the purity of the sample of @xmath18 clusters .",
    "because false detections are typically identified with the follow - up observations , the sample of @xmath18 clusters could be less than 100% pure .",
    "this could be accounted for statistically , by correcting @xmath18 for the predicted number of false detection .",
    "the purity of the sample could either be estimated with simulations or derived from that of the sample for which follow - up observations have been made .",
    "uncertainties on the purity could be accounted for by varying @xmath18 according to its predicted distribution during the estimation of cosmological parameters .",
    "in order to test the method we adopted the fiducial cosmology defined by the parameters of table [ tab : cosmology ] . we verified that this choice does not impact the results of the validation . in the following",
    ", we will denote with @xmath28 the predicted counts for the fiducial cosmology .",
    "we computed the constraints only for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters while keeping the other parameters fixed at the fiducial values .",
    "this could make our results slightly stronger than those we would expect in reality ; nonetheless , the trends we observe should be representative .",
    "the estimations have been performed for 0 , 5% , 10% and 20% missing redshifts .",
    "we considered two simulated surveys , as detailed below , using either a limit in flux density or a limit in mass as a selection function . to convert from the sz flux , @xmath29 , to cluster mass , @xmath30 , integrated within the radius where the mean enclosed density is 500 times the critical density",
    ", we adopted a relation of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the angular diameter distance to redshift @xmath22 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
