    "networks @xcite encode information in the topology of their interactions .",
    "this is the main reason why networks are ubiquitous in complexity theory and constitute the underlying structures of social , technological and biological systems .",
    "the information encoded in social networks @xcite is essential to build strong collaborations @xcite that enhance the performance of a society , to build reputation trust and to navigate @xcite efficiently the networks . for these reasons social networks are small world @xcite with short average distance between the nodes but large clustering coefficient .",
    "therefore to understand how social network evolve , adapt and respond to external stimuli , we need to develop a new information theory of complex social networks .",
    "recently , attention has been addressed to entropy measures applied to email correspondence @xcite , static networks @xcite and mobility patterns @xcite .",
    "new network entropy measures quantify the information encoded in heterogenous static networks @xcite .",
    "information theory tools set the limit of predictability of human mobility@xcite .",
    "still we lack methods to assess the information encoded in the dynamical social interaction networks .",
    "social networks are characterized by complex organizational structures revealed by network community and degree correlations @xcite .",
    "these structures are sometimes correlated with annotated features of the nodes or of the links such as age , gender , and other annotated features of the links such as shared interests , family ties or common work locations @xcite . in a recent work @xcite",
    "it has been shown by studying social , technological and biological networks that the network entropy measures can assess how significant are the annotated features for the network structure .",
    "moreover social networks evolve on many different time - scales and relevant information is encoded in their dynamics .",
    "in fact social networks are highly adaptive .",
    "indeed social ties can appear or disappear depending on the dynamical process occurring on the networks such as epidemic spreading or opinion dynamics .",
    "several models for adaptive social evolution have been proposed showing phase transitions in different universality classes @xcite .",
    "social ties have in addition to that a microscopic structure constituted by fast social interactions of the duration of a phone call or of a face - to - face interaction .",
    "dynamical social networks characterize the social interaction at this fast time scale . for these dynamical networks",
    "new network measures are starting to be defined @xcite and recent works focus on the implication that the network dynamics has on percolation , epidemic spreading and opinion dynamics @xcite .    thanks to the availability of new extensive data on a wide variety of human dynamics @xcite , human mobility @xcite and dynamical social networks @xcite , it has been recently recognized that many human activities @xcite are bursty and not poissonian .",
    "new data on social dynamical networks start to be collected with new technologies such as of radio frequency identification devices @xcite and bluetooth @xcite .",
    "these technologies are able to record the duration of social interactions and report evidence for a bursty nature of social interaction characterized by a fat tail distribution of the duration of face - to face interactions .",
    "this bursty behavior of social networks @xcite is coexisting with modulations coming from periodic daily ( circadian rhythms ) or weakly patterns @xcite .",
    "the fact that this bursty behavior is observed also in social interaction of simple animals , in the motion of rodents @xcite , or in the use of words @xcite , suggests that the underlying origin of this behavior is dictated by the biological and neurological processes underlying the dynamics of the social interaction . to our opinion",
    "this problem remains open : how much can humans intentionally change the statistics of social interactions and the level of information encoded in the dynamics of their social networks , when they are interfacing with a new technology ?    in this paper",
    "we try to address this question by studying the dynamics of interactions through phone calls and comparing it with face - to - face interactions .",
    "we show that the entropy of dynamical networks is able to quantify the information encoded in the dynamics of phone - call interactions during a typical week - day .",
    "moreover we show evidence that human social behavior is highly adaptive and that the duration of face - to - face interaction in a conference follows a different distribution than duration of phone - calls .",
    "we therefore have evidence of an intentional capability of humans to change statistically their behavior when interfacing with the technology of mobile phone communication .",
    "finally we develop a model in order to quantify how much the entropy of dynamical networks changes if we allow modifications in the distribution of duration of the interactions .",
    "in this section we introduce the entropy of dynamical social networks as a measure of information encoded in their dynamics .",
    "since we are interested in the dynamics of contacts we assume to have a quenched social network @xmath0 of friendships , collaborations or acquaintances formed by @xmath1 agents and we allow a dynamics of social interactions on this network . if two agents @xmath2 are linked in the network they can meet and interact at each given time giving rise to the dynamical social network under study in this paper .",
    "if a set of agents of size @xmath3 is connected through the social network @xmath0 the agents @xmath4 can interact in a group of size @xmath5 .",
    "therefore at any given time the static network @xmath0 will be partitioned in connected components or groups of interacting agents as shown in fig [ fig1 ] . in order to indicate that a social interaction is occurring at time @xmath6 in the group of agents @xmath7 and that these agents are not interacting with other agents",
    ", we write @xmath8 otherwise we put @xmath9 .",
    "therefore each agent is interacting with one group of size @xmath10 or non interacting ( interacting with a group of size @xmath11 ) .",
    "therefore at any given time @xmath12 where we indicate with @xmath13 an arbitrary connected subgraph of @xmath0 . the history @xmath14 of the dynamical social network is given by @xmath15 . if we indicated by @xmath16 the probability that @xmath17 given the story @xmath14 , the likelihood that at time @xmath6 the dynamical networks has a group configuration @xmath18 is given by @xmath19        the entropy @xmath20 characterizes the logarithm of the typical number of different group configurations that can be expected in the dynamical network model at time @xmath6 and is given by @xmath21 that we can explicitly express as @xmath22 according to the information theory results @xcite , if the entropy is vanishing , i.e. @xmath23 the network dynamics is regular and perfectly predictable , if the entropy is larger the number of future possible configurations is growing and the system is less predictable .",
    "if we model face - to - face interactions we have to allow the possible formation of groups of any size , on the contrary , if we model the mobile phone communication , we need to allow only for pairwise interactions . therefore",
    ", if we define the adjacency matrix of the network @xmath0 as the matrix @xmath24 , the log likelihood takes the very simple expression given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 for every time @xmath6 .",
    "the entropy is then given by @xmath27      we have analyzed the call sequence of subscribers of a major euroepan mobile service provider .",
    "we considered calls between users who at least once called each other during the examined @xmath28 months period in order to examine calls only reflecting trusted social interactions .",
    "the resulted event list consists of @xmath29 calls between @xmath30 users . for the entropy calculation we selected @xmath31 users who executed at least one call per a day during a week period .",
    "first of all we have studied how the entropy of this dynamical network is affected by circadian rhythms .",
    "we assign to each agent @xmath32 a number @xmath33 indicating the size of the group where he / she belongs .",
    "if an agent @xmath34 has coordination number @xmath35 he / she is isolated , and if @xmath36 he / she is interacting with a group of @xmath37 agents .",
    "we also assign to each agent @xmath34 the variable @xmath38 indicating the last time at which the coordination number @xmath39 has changed .",
    "if we neglect the feature of the nodes , the most simple transition probabilities that includes for some memory effects present in the data , is given by a probability @xmath40 for an agent in state @xmath5 at time @xmath6 to change his / her state given that he has been in his / her current state for a duration @xmath41 .",
    "we have estimated the probability @xmath42 in a typical week - day . using the data on the probabilities @xmath42",

    "we report evidence of adaptive human behavior by showing that the duration of phone calls , a binary social interactions mediated by technology , show different statistical features respect to face - to - face interactions .",
    "the distributions of the times describing human activities are typically broad @xcite , and are closer to power - laws , which lack a characteristic time scale , than to exponentials . in particular in @xcite there is reported data on radio frequency identification devices , with temporal resolution of 20s , showing that both distribution duration of face - to - face contacts and inter - contact periods is fat tailed during conference venues .    .",

    "the typical times @xmath49 used for the data collapse of figure 3 are listed in table [ tauw ] .",
    "the origin of this significant change in behavior of humans interactions could be due to the consideration of the cost of the interactions ( although we are not in the position to draw these conclusions ( see fig . [ pay ] in which we compare distribution of duration of calls for people with different type of contract ) or might depend on the different nature of the communication .",
    "the duration of a phone call is quite short and is not affected significantly by the circadian rhythms of the population . on the contrary",
    "the duration of no - interaction periods is strongly affected by periodic daily of weekly rhythms .",

    "the data on face - to - face and mobile - phone interactions show that a reinforcement dynamics is taking place during the human social interaction . disregarding for the moment the effects of circadian rhythms and weakly patterns , a possible explanation of such results",
    "is given by mechanisms in which the decisions of the agents to form or leave a group are driven by memory effects dictated by reinforcement dynamics , that can be summarized in the following statements : _",
    "i ) the longer an agent is interacting in a group the smaller is the probability that he / she will leave the group ; ii ) the longer an agent is isolated the smaller is the probability that he / she will form a new group_. in particular , such reinforcement principle implies that the probabilities @xmath42 that an agent with coordination number @xmath5 changes his / her state depends on the time elapsed since his / her last change of state , i.e. , @xmath52 . to ensure the reinforcement dynamics any function @xmath53 which is a decreasing function of its argument",
