    "many low mass x - ray binaries containing a neutron star show kilohertz qpos , quasi periodic oscillations with frequencies ranging from a few hundred to more than a 1200 hz . the low frequency ( @xmath0 hz ) part of the power spectrum taken from their x - ray lightcurves is usually dominated by a broad band - limited noise component .",
    "in addition to the band - limited noise several lorentzian components below 200 hz are present ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these lorentzians become broader as their characteristic frequency decreases ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , several features can , only at high frequencies , be classified as a qpo ( traditionally defined by the condition fwhm @xmath1 centroid frequency/2 , see * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to these timing features in the persistent emission , 13 sources show millisecond oscillations ( 270619 hz ) during thermonuclear x - ray bursts ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "although these burst oscillations show a slight drift , they are thought to be connected with the spin of the neutron star and were the first direct indication that these sources harbour neutron stars with millisecond spins .",
    "based on the correlated behavior of their timing properties and the behavior of the sources in color - color diagrams , that are used to study their x - ray spectral properties , many of the neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries are traditionally classified as either `` atoll '' or `` z '' sources @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and independently @xcite used the large _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "data sets now available for several of the atoll sources , to show that some of the atoll sources look much more like z sources when plotted in color - color diagrams than was previously thought .",
    "although the appearances in the color - color diagram of the two classes now is more similar , the classification still holds , as clear differences between the two classes in both timing and color behavior remain @xcite .",
    "note , that next to the differences in timing and color behavior there is also a difference in luminosity between the two classes ; where the z sources are all very luminous ( @xmath2 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the atoll sources occur over a wide range of luminosities ( @xmath3 * ? ? ?",
    "the sources 1e 17243045 , gs 182624 , and slx 1735269 , are all low - luminosity neutron stars that show thermonuclear x - ray bursts .",
    "the power spectra of these `` low - luminosity bursters '' resemble those of the atoll sources in their hard states ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; they show a broad band - limited noise component and several broad lorentzian components . however , where the characteristic frequencies of the low - frequency lorentzians were found to be similar to those in the atoll sources , the characteristic frequency of the highest frequency lorentzian seemed to be higher @xcite .    in 1998",
    "the first accreting millisecond pulsar was found with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) during an outburst of sax j1808.43658 @xcite . during this outburst",
    "no thermonuclear x - ray bursts were observed and the source did not show kilohertz qpos above 200 hz @xcite .",
    "the low frequency power spectrum was very similar to that of the atoll sources @xcite and both the atoll sources and sax j1808.43658 followed one relation when the characteristic frequency of a low - frequency lorentzian was plotted versus that of the band - limited noise @xcite . during a new outburst of sax j1808.43658 in october 2002 , kilohertz qpos ( up to 700 hz ) and burst oscillations were observed in an accreting millisecond pulsar for the first time @xcite . recently , four additional accreting millisecond pulsars were discovered ; xte j1751305 , xte j0929314 , xte j1807294 , and xte j1814338 ( see * ? ? ? * for a observational review ) . of",
    "these xte j1807294 showed kiloherz qpos ( markwardt , private communication ) and xte j1814338 showed burst oscillations @xcite .    here",

    "we study the correlations between the characteristic frequencies of their various timing features , and compare these with those of four well - studied atoll sources and three low - luminosity bursters .",

    "we also compare the behavior of the accreting millisecond pulsars in the color - color diagrams to that of the atoll sources and find that one pulsar , xte j1751305 , exhibits unusual behavior while the others act like ordinary atoll sources . in the next section",

    "for each of the pca s five pcu detectors separately we calculated a hard color , defined as the count rate in the energy band 9.7@xmath516.0 kev divided by that in the 6.0@xmath59.7 kev band , and a soft color , defined similarly as 3.5@xmath56.0 kev/2.0@xmath53.5 kev . for each detector",
    "we also calculated the intensity , the count rate in the 2.0@xmath516.0 kev band . to obtain the count rates in these exact energy ranges we interpolated linearly between count rates in the pcu channels based on the channel to energy calibration .",
    "we subtracted the background contribution in each band using pcabackest version 3.0 , with as input the `` mission - long faint model file '' if the count rate in the full energy band becomes less than 40 counts s@xmath6 during an observation ( faint data ) , and otherwise the `` mission - long bright model file '' ( bright data ) .",
    "we averaged up the background - subtracted 16s count rates to obtain count rates per observation , and we calculated the colors separately for each pcu . an observation spanned between 1 and 30 ks , and within an observation the colors generally varied by 3 to 9 times the 1 @xmath7 standard deviation of the 16s colors .",
    "for faint data we filtered out data taken within thirty minutes of the peak of the south atlantic anomaly and data with high electron contamination .",
    "the voltage settings of the pcus on board _ rxte _ were changed on three occasions defining the first four _ rxte _ gain epochs .",

    "for the gain drifts within these epochs , as well as for the differences in effective area between the pcus themselves we calculated the colors for each pcu of the crab nebula , which can supposed to be constant in its colors , in the same manner .",
    "we then averaged the 16s crab colors and intensity per pcu for each day . for each pcu we divided the obtained color and intensity points per observation by the corresponding crab values that are closest in time but within the same gain epoch .",
    "we then averaged the colors and intensity over all pcus .",
    "note that starting may 12 , 2000 , the propane layer on pcu0 , which functions as an anti - coincidence shield for charged particles , was lost , defining the beginning of gain epoch 5 .",
    "therefore we applied the additional filter recommended by the rxte science team to pcu0 data from epoch 5 .      for the fourier timing analysis we used the 122@xmath8s time - resolution event modes and the 0.95@xmath8s time - resolution good xenon modes .",
    "we used data from all energy channels .",
    "we constructed power spectra per observation ( see above ) using data segments of 256 s and 1/8192 s time bins such that the lowest available frequency is 1/256 hz and the nyquist frequency 4096 hz ; the normalization of @xcite was used .",
    "we subtracted a poisson noise level using the method of @xcite , which is built on the analytical function from @xcite .",
    "the resulting power spectra were then converted to squared fractional rms . within the observations",
    "the power spectra did not change within the errors . when possible several observations , adjacent in time , and for which the power spectra remain the same , were added up to improve the statistics .",

    "note , that we no longer constrained the lorentzian @xcite that fits the band - limited noise component to be zero - centered , but instead let all lorentzian parameters float .",

    "might we have wrongly identified the highest frequency lorentzian component as l@xmath20 while it really is l@xmath32 ?",
    "there are a number of arguments against this , all based on similarities with the atoll source class of which sax j1808.43658 seems part ( see  [ sec.1808_colors ] ) .",
    "first , l@xmath32 was detected together with the component identified as l@xmath20 in sax j1808.43658 by @xcite ( our group 3 , see  [ sec.1808_2002 ] ) when the source was almost in the lower left banana ( see  [ sec.1808_colors ] ) . in group",
    "3 l@xmath32 is weak and l@xmath20 is strong ( see table [ tbl.rms ] ) ; this is common behavior for atoll sources when they are almost in the lower left banana @xcite .",
    "second , in the island and extreme island states of sax j1808.43658 the component identified as l@xmath20 is a strong broad component that is present over a broad frequency range while l@xmath32 is not .",
    "this is again common behavior for the atoll sources , where l@xmath32 was observed in an island state only once , and then as a narrow and weak qpo @xcite .",
    "the frequency relations of the accreting millisecond pulsars and the low luminosity bursters of figure [ fig.freq_freq ] , and especially the shift between the relations of sax j1808.43658 and the atoll sources , provide new clues about the identification of some power spectral components .",
    "we assume here that the shift in figure [ fig.freq_freq ] is a shift in @xmath44 ; the conclusions drawn below do not change if we use the alternative , a shift in @xmath43 , @xmath42 , and @xmath41 ( see  [ sec.compare_timing ] ) .",
    "the strong , broad highest - frequency lorentzian in the extreme island state of the atoll sources could previously be identified as either l@xmath20 or l@xmath25 based on its frequency of about 200 hz . the rms fractional amplitude vs. frequency relations of 4u 0614 + 09 , 4u 1608 - 52 , and 4u 1728 - 34 gave a hint that this lorentzian was l@xmath20 @xcite .",

    "[ fig.freq_freq ] ) , supporting the conclusion that it is indeed l@xmath20 .",
    "this conclusion is further strengthened by the results for the low luminosity bursters 1e 17243045 , gs 182624 , and slx 1735269 .",
    "these sources , which always have a power spectrum similar to that in the extreme island state of the atoll sources , show a clear correlation between the frequency identified as @xmath44 , and @xmath43 , @xmath42 , and @xmath41 ( fig .",

    "note also that with the addition of the extreme island state results for aql x1 , the atoll sources now also show these same correlations in the extreme island state ( when @xmath44 is around 200 hz ) .",
    "so , we identify the broad low frequency features previously reported by @xcite from the 1998 outburst as manifestations of l@xmath20 .",

    "note that the power spectra in the extreme island state of some sources also show extra timing features , but these are in the form of weak narrow qpos that do not dominate the power spectra .",
    "because of the complex behavior of the low - frequency noise above @xmath87 hz in figure [ fig.freq_freq_shifted ] we concentrate now on the more simple frequency relations below @xmath87 hz in figure [ fig.freq_freq_shifted ]",

    "however , the required @xmath98 values were too large for l@xmath23 to be the fundamental lense - thirring precession frequency @xcite .",
    "also the @xmath89 vs. @xmath90 relations coincided for 4u 172834 and 4u 160852 , which is not expected in this interpretation in view of their different spin frequencies ( 363 hz and 620 hz , respectively , assuming burst oscillations happen at the spin frequency ) .",
    "the relation of the frequency difference between the 410 hz qpo and the @xmath36 hz pulse spike of sax j1808.43658 was found to be consistent with a quadratic relation by @xcite .",

    "the frequency correlations of sax j1808.43658 and xte j0929314 are shifted compared to those of the other sources in a way that is most easily described as a shift in upper and lower kilohertz qpo frequency by about a factor 1.5 ( see  [ sec.compare_timing ] ) . in most models",
    "@xmath44 reflects the keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the accretion disk ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if this is indeed the correct interpretation , then for similar characteristic frequencies of the low frequency components , this inner radius of the disk can somehow get closer to the neutron star surface in the atoll sources , low luminosity bursters , and the accreting millisecond pulsars xte j1751305 and xte j1814338 than in the accreting millisecond pulsars sax j1808.43658 and xte j0929314 .",
