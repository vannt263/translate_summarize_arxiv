    "the understanding of a realistic dynamical model is strongly related to the capability of identifying the chaotic and the regular nature of its orbits .",
    "one the one hand , one of the main features of chaotic orbits is their high sensitivity to the initial conditions ( hereinafter i.c . ) , and the concept of local exponential divergence applies perfectly to identify such correspondence . on the other hand , the regular orbits do not show this behaviour . a seminal contribution to the field of chaos detection",
    "has been made by lyapunov when he introduced the lyapunov characteristic exponents , hereinafter lces @xcite .",
    "the lces are theoretical quantities that measure the local rate of exponential divergence .",
    "therefore , the lces are appropriate to distinguish between chaotic and regular motion .",
    "the lces constitute the backbone of variational indicators of chaos ( vics ) .",
    "moreover , their numerical implementation @xcite , i.e. the lyapunov indicators ( lis ) , was a major contribution to the development of both fast and easy  to  compute new vics .",
    "nowadays , there is a plethora of vics in the literature , such as the smaller alignment index , sali @xcite , and its generalized version , the generalized alignment index , gali @xcite ; the mean exponential growth factor of nearby orbits , megno @xcite ; the fast lyapunov indicator , fli @xcite ; its variant , the orthogonal fast lyapunov indicator , ofli @xcite ; and a second order variant of the ofli , the ofli@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can include the vics based on the properties of dynamical spectra like the invariant spectra of stretching numbers or local lyapunov characteristic numbers , llcns @xcite , the invariant spectra of helicity or twist angles @xcite and the spectral distance @xcite .",
    "finally , we include the relative lyapunov indicator , rli @xcite , which is not based on the evolution of the solution of the first variational equations as the others , but on the evolution of two different but very close orbits .",
    "notwithstanding the large number of vics cited , we could also include alternative methods , for instance , the average power law exponent , aple @xcite , which is based on the concept of tsallis entropy ; evolutionary algorithms @xcite ; and the record could indeed continue .",
    "together with the vics , the spectral analysis methods ( sams ) , based on the numerical analysis of some particular quantities of a single orbit , e.g. its frequency , have also achieved great popularity in the field of chaos detection . among the sams",
    "we find the method outlined by @xcite : the frequency map analysis , fma @xcite and a modification of the latter in order to improve the precision in the computed frequencies and amplitudes , the frequency modified fourier transform , fmft @xcite or other alternatives using fast fourier transform ( fft ) techniques @xcite , among others . as an easy identification of the important resonances ( regions of phase space occupied by orbits with commensurable orbital frequencies ) is possible with the sams , they are able to identify the major resonant orbit families . the relative importance of each family regarding the phase space can be assessed from the number of orbits associated with the particular resonance the family belongs to .",
    "that is , the sams are not only suitable to determine the resonance web like the vics @xcite but also to identify the individual resonances by their frequency vectors .",
    "though the conceptual bases of the vics and the sams are totally different , many researchers use both types of techniques for similar goals . nevertheless , we show herein that this seems to be a no reliable approach to study some important aspects of the dynamics of a hamiltonian system . moreover , in the literature there are plenty of evidence that the complementary use of both types of techniques results an efficient and solid way to gather dynamical information from a hamiltonian system @xcite .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the authors compare the sensitivity of the fli and the fma on the standard map and on the @xcite potential . in @xcite",
    "the authors use the fli and the analytically filtered fourier analysis , affa @xcite , another example of sam , to determine the value of the critical parameter at which the transition from the unfortunately called nekhoroshev to the chirikov regime occurs in a quasi  integrable hamiltonian model and a standard @xmath1dimensional map . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors use a measure related with the lces , the alignment indices @xcite and an index computed with the fmft to study two different n  body models simulating elliptical galaxies .",
    "one of the aspects that makes a research accurate is the reliability of the tools available for the analysis .",
    "this reliability is a measure of , for instance , the confidence and efficiency of such tools .",
    "regarding chaos detection , we believe that it is on the diversity of the employed techniques that the fruitfulness of the research relies . therefore , we started a series composed of four papers in order to achieve the best combination of tools to study a given dynamical problem . in a first paper , @xcite",
    ", we test the megno against the most widely used chaos detection technique in the literature , which is the li , on a somewhat realistic problem : a self  consistent triaxial stellar ( scts ) dynamical model @xcite . in the second and third papers , @xcite ( hereinafter m11 ) and @xcite ( hereinafter d12 ) ,",
    "we make a comparison of most of the vics mentioned earlier on rather simple problems , i.e. on mappings and on the model of @xcite , respectively .",
    "our purpose here is to extend the previous comparisons of vics to alternative techniques , including a spectral analysis method .",
    "further , this last paper of the series is regarded as a closing report on the subject and the conclusions comprise the whole investigation .",
    "we continue with the scts model and study two start spaces for four different energy levels by means of several chaos detection tools . in order to select appropriate vics for the study",
    ", we consider the results of m11 and d12 and add a rather new technique , the aple , and an alternative quantity given by the megno : the megno s slope estimation of the largest lce ( se_l_lce ) to their comparison .",
    "the megno is part of the suggested vics to compose the cisf in d12 . in fact , we are interested in studying if its variant , i.e. the se_l_lce , is more reliable than the megno on its own .",
    "the study is organized as follows : in section [ themodel ] we describe the scts model and introduce the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 start spaces . in section [ cis&fmft ]",
    ", we briefly introduce the chaos detection techniques to be used within the reported research .",
    "we start with the vics : the li , the megno and the se_l_lce ( section [ cis&fmft - s1 ] ) ; the fli and the ofli ( section [ cis&fmft - s2 ] ) and the aple ( section [ cis&fmft - s3 ] ) .",
    "we finish with a short fmft introduction ( section [ cis&fmft - s4 ] ) . in section [ thefmft ]",
    ", we deal with the capability of the fmft to resolve the different structures in a divided phase space ( section [ fmft - cis1 ] ) and compare its performance with the se_l_lce in both start spaces of the scts model ( section [ fmft - cis2 ] ) . in section [ stationary ] , we study the efficiency of several vics on the @xmath2 start space to decide which ones are appropriate to investigate the dynamics of the scts model ( sections [ stationarys1 ] and [ stationarys2 ] ) . in section [ thespaces ]",
    "we analyse for four different energy surfaces , the @xmath2 ( section [ stationarys4 ] ) and the @xmath3 ( section [ startx0z0 ] ) start spaces by means of a complementary use of the vics selected in the previous section .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] summarizes the main conclusions of the whole investigation .",
    "as the extensive used of acronyms in the text might be overwhelming for the reader , in table [ acronyms ] we list in alphabetical order the most important acronyms used in this paper .",
    ".list of the most important acronyms in alphabetical order . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here , we implement the same procedure applied in section [ stationarys4 ] to study the @xmath3 start space .",
    "we obtain the phase space portraits with the se__l__lce for four energy surfaces , calibrating the thresholds with the assistance of the li , and we further discuss the global dynamics of the @xmath3 start space .    in order to determine the percentages of the chaotic component , we proceed like we did in section [ stationarys4 ] .",
    "we present the results ordered by energy surface on table [ tablestart - percent ] .    in fig .",
    "[ startx0z0 - 1 ] , we present the phase space portraits of the @xmath3 start space to have the same scales in fig .",
    "[ startx0z0 - 1 ] for every energy surface",
    ". then , the percentages of orbits that we do not consider are negligible . those percentages are @xmath4% in the energy surface @xmath5 , @xmath6% in @xmath7 , @xmath8% in @xmath9 and @xmath8% in @xmath10 . ] for the same energy surfaces considered in section [ stationarys4 ] .",
    "also the total integration times remain the same and the vics used for the study guarantee reliable and stable pictures .",
    "the numbers of orbits in the samples are different and depend on the energy surface : 998938 i.c . for the energy surface @xmath5 , 998948 for @xmath7 , 999400 for @xmath9 and 998626 for @xmath10 .",
    "there is a significant change in the dynamics of the @xmath3 start space with respect to the results for the @xmath2 start space . the corresponding phase space portraits presented in fig .",
    "[ startx0z0 - 1 ] show a dominant regular component ( see table [ tablestart - percent ] , columns three and five ) instead of the rather large chaotic component seen for the @xmath2 start space .",
    "the percentages of the smaller component have a substantial increment toward the innermost energy surface . indeed ,",
    "in this case , the expansion of the chaotic component is due to the growth of the different orbital families separatrices .",
    "this fact is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ startx0z0 - 1 ] . on the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ startx0z0 - 1 ] , we can see a very weak separatrix that separates the short  axis tubes from the outer long  axis tubes .",
    "on the top right panel of the same figure , we can see how the former separatrix is connected to the others which separate the inner long  axis tubes and the box orbits ( see @xcite for further details on the different orbital families and their locations in phase space ) .",
    "this becomes evident in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ startx0z0 - 1 ] . furthermore",
    ", a strong chaotic domain appears in the crossing of the main separatrices .",
    "therefore , as the dominant component comprises regular orbits , the main contribution to the chaotic component emerges from the separatrices of resonances .",
    "finally , the dynamics of the @xmath3 start space can be briefly described as a dominant regular component .",
    "the major resonances that separate the main orbital families have separatrices which grow when the negative energies increase .",
    "furthermore , the growth of the separatrices increases the percentage of chaotic orbits very fast .",
    "with this report we conclude a series of investigations ( reported in @xcite , m11 and d12 ) toward an efficient choice of a minimal package of techniques to study a general hamiltonian .    here , we apply both vics and a sam ( the fmft , @xcite ) to study a fairly realistic dynamical model of an elliptical galaxy ( the scts model , @xcite ) .    in order to select the appropriate vics for the experiments ,",
    "we not only consider previous comparisons , but also extend them with new indicators : the se__l__lce and the aple @xcite .",
    "the se__l__lce is an efficient estimation of the llce by means of the megno @xcite and works as its reliable alternative in case of studying big samples of orbits .",
    "the aple has not shown advantages over the fli / ofli for the purposes of the experiment , but it behaves similarly .",
    "the se__l__lce seems to improve the performance of the megno , in particular situations .",
    "therefore , it should be considered in the cisf presented in d12 as a suitable alternative .    on the other hand",
    ", we consider the performance of the fmft as the representative sam to compare with the vics .",
    "the fmft is an improvement of the fma outlined by laskar @xcite , which is widely used by the scientific community .",
    "the main advantage of the sams is a fast computation of the frequencies .",
    "however , the performance of the fmft as a global indicator of chaos is not as efficient as the performances shown by the vics in the experiments .",
    "the sams are designed to compute the frequencies , which are quantities strictly related to regular motion .",
    "using such techniques as global indicators of chaos involves forcing the methods to do something for which they are not designed .",
    "the vics are based on the concept of local exponential divergence .",
    "hence , the detection of chaos is their main purpose .",
    "a natural consequence of this is that an efficient application of those techniques is based on their complementary implementation ( see section [ intro ] for references ) .",
    "the sams are of use to describe the resonance web while the vics to study the interplay of regular and chaotic domains ( see section [ thespaces ] ) .",
    "finally , the recommended cisf for the analysis of a general hamiltonian is composed of the megno / se__l__lce , the fli / ofli and the gali@xmath11 : the megno / se__l__lce and the fli / ofli as global indicators of chaos to obtain the phase space portraits and display the interaction between regular and chaotic orbits ; the gali@xmath11 to analyse small samples within regions of complex dynamics and regions where the chaotic component is dominant ( see @xcite and d12 ) .",
    "furthermore , the cisf can be used with a sam ( e.g. the fmft ) in order to characterise the resonance web with the frequency vectors .",

    "muzzio for his assistance along the investigation and the english department of fcag ",
    "unlp for improving the english of the reported research .",
