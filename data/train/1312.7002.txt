    "the search for periodic orbits in the three - body problem has a long history @xcite .",
    "this work is follow - up of the previous study @xcite where a systematic numerical search for periodic solutions was started and some 13 new families of solutions were reported .",
    "here we focus on a particular window in the space of initial velocities bracketing the figure - eight initial conditions ( the initial positions are fixed at the so - called euler point ) .",
    "all eleven periodic solutions that we report here belong to ( special ) classes that can be described topologically as some power of figure - eight topological class .",
    "one of these solutions , one with the seventh power of the `` figure - eight '' , is a choreography .",
    "choreographies are a special kind of the three - body periodic orbits such that all bodies travel along the same trajectory in the plane , chasing one another around the trajectory at equal time intervals .",
    "the first and simplest choreography ever found is the lagrange solution ( 1772 ) , in which three equal - mass particles move on a circle , while forming an equilateral triangle .",
    "that solution , however , is both unstable and has non - vanishing angular momentum .",
    "the first stable three - body choreographic orbit without angular momentum was found by moore in 1993 @xcite . a formal variational existence proof for such solution is given by chenciner and montgomery @xcite .    a large number ( 345 ) of three - body choreographies with non - zero angular momentum has been found by sim @xcite , but they are all highly unstable @xcite . in papers",
    "@xcite , sim and co - authors have shown several solutions including one choreography that they called `` satellites of the eight '' .",
    "these satellite solutions , topologically speaking , might be associated with some power of figure - eight orbit . here",
    "we report the discovery of one new stable , zero - angular - momentum choreographic solution to the planar newtonian three - body problem with equal masses .",
    "before describing these solutions , we briefly remind the reader about the shape sphere coordinates that we are using for the classification of periodic solutions .      with two three - body jacobi relative coordinate vectors , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , there are three independent scalar three - body variables .",
    "the hyper - radius @xmath2 defines the `` overall size '' of the system and removes one of the three linear combinations of scalar variables .",
    "thus , one may relate the three scalars to a unit three - vector @xmath3 with the cartesian components @xmath4 .",
    "the domain of these three - body variables is a sphere with unit radius @xcite , @xcite , see figure [ fsfig8 ] .",
    "the equatorial circle corresponds to collinear configurations ( degenerate triangles ) and the three points on it , figure [ fsfig8 ] correspond to two - body - collision singularities in the potential .",
    "the shape sphere together with the hyper - radius defines the configuration space of the planar three - body problem ( the `` missing '' total rotation angle can be reconstructed from the trajectory in this space and the condition of angular momentum conservation ) .    the `` figure - eight '' solution can be described as a slalom , i.e. as moving in a zig - zag manner on the shape sphere , between the two - body singularities , while drifting in the same general direction along the equator , e.g. eastward , or westward , see figure [ fsfig8 ] . as a consequence of parity , the number of full turns ( the `` winding number '' ) around the shape sphere sufficient to reach the initial conditions must be even , and the minimal number is two , which is the case for the figure eight orbit .",
    "there is at least one other known solution , that makes two full turns around the shape sphere , that is stable , but not a choreography : that is sim s figure eight orbit ( labeled by h3 in ref .",
    "the question remains : are there any other periodic orbits with a higher winding number ?",
    "such an orbit would have to `` miss '' the initial point in the phase space at each turn before the last one .",
    "again , due parity , the winding number of such a trajectory has to be an even number @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "if there are such solutions , then another question is : are there any choreographies among them ?      we use the topological classification of periodic three - body solutions , suggested by montgomery @xcite . considering a periodic orbit as a closed curve on a sphere with three punctures ( the shape sphere with three singularities of the potential ) ,",
    "the clasification of closed curves is given by the conjugacy classes of the fundamental group , which is , in this case , the free group on two letters @xmath7 .",
    "graphically , this amounts to classifying closed curves according to their `` topologies '' on a sphere with three punctures . a stereographic projection of this sphere onto a plane , using one of the punctures as the `` north pole '' effectively removes that puncture to infinity , and reduces the problem to one of classifying closed curves in a plane with two punctures .",
    "that leads to the aforementioned free group on two letters @xmath7 , where ( for definiteness ) @xmath8 denotes a clockwise `` full turn / circle '' around the right - hand - side puncture , and @xmath9 denotes the counter - clockwise full turn / circle around the other pole / hole / puncture in the plane / sphere , see fig . [ f : freegroup ] .    for better legibility",
    "we denote their inverses by capitalized letters @xmath10 .",
    "each family of orbits is associated with the conjugacy class of a free group element .",
    "for example the conjugacy class of @xmath11 contains @xmath12 .",
    "the `` figure - eight '' orbit is related to the conjugacy class of the element @xmath13 .",
    "the aforementioned curves with a `` winding number '' @xmath5 belong to the conjugacy class of the group element @xmath14 .",
    "orbits of this kind will be called * slaloms * and the exponent @xmath15 will be called the * slalom power*.      here we use the same numerical approach as in ref . @xcite . the return proximity function in the phase space is defined as the absolute minimum of the distance from the initial condition by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a 12-vector in the phase space ( all three bodies cartesian coordinates and velocities , i.e. without removing the center - of - mass motion ) , and @xmath18 is 12-vector describing the initial condition .",
    "we also define the return time @xmath19 as the time for which this minimum is reached . searching for periodic solutions with a period @xmath20 smaller",
    "then the parameter @xmath21 is clearly equivalent to finding zeros of the return proximity function .",
    "the initial conditions for both moore s @xcite and sim s @xcite figure eight solutions can be found in the two dimensional subspace of the eight - dimensional three - body phase space with the center - of - mass motion removed , see fig .",
    "[ f : big ] .",
    "formally this two dimensional search plane is defined as the set of collinear congurations ( `` syzygies '' ) with one body exactly in the middle between the other two ( the so - called euler points ) , and with vanishing initial time derivative of the hyper - radius @xmath22 and vanishing angular momentum . in this subspace ,",
    "all three particles initial conditions can be specified by two parameters , the initial @xmath23 and @xmath24 components , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , of a single velocity two - vector , as follows , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the differential equations of motion were solved numerically using the runge - kutta - fehlberg 4.5 method and the return proximity function was calculated using linear interpolation between calculated trajectory points in the phase space . in all our calculations , the particle masses",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and newton s gravitational constant @xmath37 were set equal to unity .",
    "we focused our numerical search on the ( two - dimensional ) search window in the two dimensional search plane ( defined above ) around the `` figure - eight '' initial conditions : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , see figure [ f : big ] .",
    "the equations of motion were integrated up to time @xmath40 for each initial condition out of @xmath41 possibilities ( points on the grid ) within the search window .",
    "the return proximity function @xmath42 was calculated and is shown in figure [ f : big ] . for each local minimum of the return proximity function lower",
    "then @xmath43 ( bright dots in figure [ f : big ] ) on this grid we used the simple gradient descent algorithm to find the position of the minimum ( root ) more accurately .",
    "all minima below @xmath44 are listed in table [ tab:1 ] and can be seen in figure [ f : big ] .",
    "the initial conditions for moore s `` figure - eight '' choreography and sim s `` figure - eight '' orbit are labeled by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively in table i. all other labeled orbits in table i are slaloms of power @xmath15 .    .initial conditions and periods of three - body orbits .",
    "@xmath47 are the first particle s initial velocities in the x- and y - directions , respectively , @xmath20 is the period , @xmath15 is slalom power ( i.e. @xmath48 is homotopy class of the orbit ) , and the last column is the geometric - algebric ( g - a ) class ( for explanation see text ) .",
    "we also list moore s ( @xmath45 ) and sim s ( @xmath46 ) figure - eight orbits , for comparison . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:1 ]    there is a restriction on the slalom power @xmath15 in the case of choreographic solutions .",
    "if a solution is a choreography , the three masses folow each other , with a time delay of @xmath49 , where @xmath20 is the full period .",
    "if one follows a choreography starting with a delay of @xmath49 , one sees the same motion as without that delay , up to a cyclic permutation of three particles .",
    "algebraically , this can be written as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a cyclic permutation .",
    "the cyclic permutation @xmath52 has a simple representation on the shape sphere , _ viz . _ a rotation by @xmath53 around the vertical z - axis . for a choreography the azimuthal angle on the shape sphere after motion through time",
    "@xmath49 will be @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the slalom power @xmath15 of any choreography can not be a number divisible by @xmath55 ( otherwise @xmath54 is an integer multiple of @xmath56 , and the net rotation mustnot be @xmath57 ) .      all solutions listed in table [ tab:1 ] satisfy the above choreography condition , but only solutions labeled @xmath59 and @xmath60 are choreographies .",
    "it turns out that these two solutions are equivalent , up to rescaling of temporal and spatial coordinates by the scaling law @xcite : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and consequently @xmath63 . the trajectory @xmath64 in real space is shown in figure [ f:87 ] .",
    "this solution is centrally symmetric with respect to reflections about the origin , which is the initial position of the `` middle '' mass , as a consequence of the fact that all bodies follow the same trajectory , that equations of motion are symmetric under time reversal and that all initial conditions are symmetric under the combined action of parity @xmath65 , time - reversal @xmath66 and transposition @xmath67 .",
    "it appears that our choreography does not have any additional symmetries in real space .",
    "the slalom power @xmath15 of this solution is seven .",
    "the trajectory in real space is composed of seven concatenated distorted figure - eight curves , fig .",
    "the trajectory passes through the coordinate origin twice . by following the position of the second mass",
    "one can see that the first passage through the origin corresponds to the initial time , whereas the second one corresponds to the point in time when the phase space position scales into the @xmath60 initial condition .",
    "the curves @xmath64 and @xmath68 in the @xmath69 plane are connected by a homothetic transformation with a homothety factor @xmath70 and rotation angle of @xmath71 radians . the minus sign in the homothety factor",
    "@xmath72 means that the two trajectories have opposite orientations , or in physical terms , that these two motions are time reversed .",
    "the key feature of this choreography is its stability .",
    "the return proximity per period : @xmath73 , where @xmath20 is period , is calculated up to a thousand periods ( i.e. 42000 syzigies ) and is shown in fig [ ffig87s ] . in order to check if this solution is a true choreography , we show on the same plot : @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the minimal distances per period between the initial condition point and the two cyclic permutations of the trajectory coordinates in the phase space , respectively .",
    "whereas the first array is zero for any periodic solution , all three arrays are zero when the solution is a choreography .",
    "one can see in figure [ ffig87s ] that all three values fluctuate around an approximately constant level of @xmath44 . running our calculation up to 25,000 periods ( or one million syzygies )",
    "we see that the noise level slowly rises in time , reaching the value @xmath76 towards the end of our computation .",
    "this is comparable with the cummulative numerical error in this calculation .",
    "other solutions ( denoted by @xmath78 ) shown in table [ tab:1 ] correspond to different slalom powers @xmath15 .",
    "the first one , denoted by @xmath79 , belongs to the same slalom power @xmath58 as the new choreography solution , but it is not a choreography . the second one @xmath80 is the same solution as the first one @xmath79 , up to a rotation and scaling of space - time .",
    "the two slalom power @xmath81 solutions @xmath82 and @xmath83 are also identical . the solution @xmath84 has slalom power @xmath85 .      all other solutions ( @xmath87-@xmath88 ) have the slalom power @xmath86 , but demand special attention to determine if they are identical . in figure [ ffigfit ]",
    "we show the period @xmath20 as a function of the absolute value of the energy @xmath89 for these orbits .",
    "the fitting parameter @xmath90 for the fit shown in figure [ ffigfit ] with the scaling law @xmath91 is : @xmath92 , with the reduced @xmath93-square value of @xmath94 .",
    "such good agreement with the scaling law indicates that all these solutions may correspond to the same orbit .",
    "a careful analysis of passages through euler points shows , however , that there are seven different @xmath86 slaloms .",
    "solutions @xmath87 and @xmath95 correspond to same orbit .",
    "this is also the case with @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and with @xmath98 and @xmath88 . on the shape",
    "sphere each of these pairs of solutions has exactly the same trajectory , whereas their real - space trajectories are related by scaling transformations .",
    "all solutions presented here fall into three new algebraic - geometric classes according to the classification scheme defined in ref .",
    "there were two different geometric classes defined in @xcite : ( i ) those with ( two ) reflection symmetries about two orthogonal axes  the equator and the zeroth meridian passing through the `` far '' collision point ; and ( ii ) those with a ( single ) central reflection symmetry about one point  the intersection of the equator and the aforementioned zeroth meridian . here ,",
    "we have found two additional classes : ( iii ) those with reflection symmetries about only one axis  the equator ; and ( iv ) those without any geometric symmetry on the shape sphere .    similarly , in ref .",
    "@xcite orbits were divided according to the algebraic exchange symmetries of ( conjugacy classes of ) their free group elements : ( a ) with free group elements that are symmetric under @xmath99 and @xmath100 , ( b ) with free group elements symmetric under @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and ( c ) with free group elements that are not symmetric under either of the two symmetries ( a ) or ( b ) .    we have observed empirically in ref .",
    "@xcite that , for all orbits presented there , the algebraic symmetry class ( a ) corresponds to the geometric class ( i ) , and that the algebraic class ( c ) corresponds to the geometric class ( ii ) , whereas the algebraic class ( b ) may fall into either of the two geometric classes .",
    "however , our new choreography solution does not obey this rule .",
    "it belongs to the algebraic symmetry class ( a ) , but corresponds to the geometric class ( ii ) .",
    "this defines a new geometric - algebric class ii.a .",
    "the remaining solutions ( slaloms ) presented here define two additional classes : iii.a and iv.a ( see the last column in table [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "in conclusion , as the result of numerical studies , we have found 11 new three - body solutions that can be described as slaloms with powers @xmath103 .",
    "one of these solutions ( @xmath104 ) , with @xmath58 , is a stable choreography .",
    "this particular orbit ought to be of special interest to mathematicians interested in rigorous existence proofs of three - body solutions .",
    "other new non - choreographic orbits hold the same general interest as the solutions found in ref .",
