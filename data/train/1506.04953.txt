    "classical nova are the result of a thermonuclear runaway taking place on the surface of a white dwarf and are fueled by matter accreted on to the white dwarf from a companion star .",
    "these outbursts give rise to an increase in luminosity and eject between @xmath3 of material at velocities @xmath4 @xmath5  .",
    "nova outbursts have also been detected in the gev gamma - rays regime with _ fermi gamma ray space telescope _",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the likely source of these gamma - ray photons is strong shocks , which can generate relativistic particles via the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism and the relativistic particles can then generate gamma - rays  @xcite .",
    "but the details of shocks and shock acceleration in novae still remains a poorly understood issue , despite the potential for insight into the nature of these high - energy events  @xcite .",
    "the first nova to be detected by _",
    "fermi _ was v407 cyg , and it received considerable attention  @xcite . given that v407 cyg has a mira giant secondary with a strong wind ( a member of the symbiotic class of systems ) , a model to explain the gamma - rays was proposed wherein a shock was generated as the nova ejecta interacted with the dense ambient medium surrounding the red - giant companion .",
    "this model , however , failed to explain v1324 sco , v959 mon , v339 del  @xcite , v1369 cen  @xcite , and nova sgr 2015b  @xcite , all of which are novae that were detected by _",
    "fermi _ but lack a detectable red - giant companion ( hereafter referred to as non - symbiotic gamma - ray - detected novae which , for the sake of brevity , we will refer to as ngdn ) .",
    "this non - detection of a red - giant companion implies that these novae have main - sequence companions with low - density circumstellar material .",
    "we note that , while it is possible for these novae to have high density circumstellar material despite not having a red - giant companion , no evidence has yet been found for dusty circumstellar material around cataclysmic variables  @xcite .",
    "the primary analysis for the ngdn was presented in  @xcite , which did not include v1369 cen or nova sgr 2015b .",
    "therefore the discussion that follows will only focus on the three non - symbiotic gamma - ray - detected nova discussed in  @xcite .",
    "while no direct explanation was proposed by @xcite to explain the gamma - ray production in v1324 sco , v959 mon , and v339 del , they did suggest that these novae were similar enough to one another that they represented a homogeneous population .",
    "their evidence for a homogeneous population was that all three had similar gamma - ray spectra and light curves and were otherwise unremarkable novae .",
    "@xcite went on to suggest that it is only the close proximity of the ngdn that made them detectable by _ fermi _ , and that other novae would be detected if only they were closer .",
    "however , as we show in this paper , the ngdn are not actually homogeneous , as one of them clearly stands out from the rest .",
    "v1324 sco is located in one of the fields continually observed by the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ) group , and its outburst was initially detected in 2012 may as part of their high - cadence @xmath6-band photometry  @xcite .",
    "the initial detection showed a slow monotonic rise in brightness between may 14 - may 31 , followed by a very large ( @xmath7 mag ) increase in brightness between june 1 - june 3  @xcite .",
    "approximately two weeks after its optical brightening ( 2012 june 1 , which we take to be the primary nova event ) it was detected by the _ fermi _",
    "collaboration as a new transient source  @xcite , with gamma - ray emission lasting a further @xmath82 weeks  @xcite .",
    "there are several things that make v1324 sco unusual when compared to the other ngdn .    to begin with",
    ", v1324 sco is the most gamma - ray luminous , being at least @xmath9 times greater than the other gamma - ray - detected novae ( including v407 cyg ) .",
    "the estimate for the gamma - ray luminosity , done by  @xcite , was based on distance estimations derived using the maximum magnitude rate of decline ( mmrd ) method , a technique that has been the subject of serious critiques in recent publications ( see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the mmrd derived distance used in  @xcite was @xmath10 kpc , derived using the relation of  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that  @xcite do emphasize the uncertainty associated with this value , explicitly stating that a possible dust event could compromise their determination of the rate of decline in luminosity , which would alter their derived distance . in this paper",
    "we find a distance limit greater than that , meaning that the gamma - ray luminosity for v1324 sco is _ even greater _ than initially calculated .",
    "another unusual aspect of v1324 sco is that it was never detected as an x - ray source . along with diffuse shock acceleration",
    ", shocks also generate a tremendous amount of heat , raising the ejecta to @xmath8 kev temperatures  @xcite .",
    "this hot shocked gas can be observed by looking for hard x - rays  @xcite .",
    "a stronger shock should generate more heat , which implies that the gamma - ray luminosity and x - ray luminosity should correlate with one another .",
    "however , despite the extreme gamma - ray luminosity of v1324 sco , it was never detected as an x - ray source  @xcite .",
    "v1324 sco clearly stands out among the ngdn , and this paper is focused on placing better constraints on this unique nova by finding values for the reddening and a distance limit .",
    "we present the results from our analysis of both spectroscopic and near - ir photometric data of v1324 sco to find a distance limit , reddening , and constrain the luminosity class of the companion star . in section  [ sec : obsandreduc ] we present the details of the data observations and reduction . in section  [ sec : reddening ]",
    "we detail the methods used to derive a value for the reddening , and in section  [ sec : distance ] we provide similar details for our distance limit . in section  [ sec : prog ] we discuss the constraints we can place on the progenitor system and in section  [ sec : concl ] we conclude by deriving a new lower limit on the gamma - ray luminosity using our new distance limit .",
    "to determine the reddening we analyzed two high - resolution spectroscopic observations of v1324 sco ; a very early time very large telescope ( vlt ) observation , and a late time observation using the magellan telescope .",
    "the vlt observation was taken from the archive , with the original observations reported by @xcite .",
    "the magellan observations were obtained by the authors .",
    "spectra were taken on 2012 june 4.1 ut ( + 3.1 days after main outburst ) by  @xcite using the ultraviolet and visible echelle spectrograph ( uves ) instrument on the vlt  @xcite .",
    "the spectra were taken as part of the follow - up conducted by the moa group .",
    "copies of the data were made publicly available on the eso archive and were obtained by the authors .",
    "observations were made in dichroic mode , with the blue arm centered at 4370   ( spanning @xmath11  ) and the red arm centered at 7600   ( covering @xmath12  ) , taken using two ccds that have a chip gap between @xmath13 .",
    "the slit width was @xmath14 with an average seeing of @xmath15 , giving a resolution of @xmath16 for the blue arm and @xmath17 for the red arm .",
    "four 1800 second integrations were taken with @xmath18 binning , with each integration having an average signal - to - noise of @xmath19 per pixel for the blue arm and @xmath20 per pixel for the red .",
    "the reduction was undertaken using the standard eso reflex data reduction pipeline , which includes flatfield correction , bias subtraction , cosmic - ray removal , spectral extraction , and wavelength calibration using comparison spectra of a thar lamp ( see   for details on the data reduction procedure ) .",
    "the four individual spectrum frames were combined using the iraf routine _ ndcombine _ , giving a final @xmath21 per pixel of @xmath22 in the blue and @xmath21 per pixel of @xmath23 in the red .",
    "further observations were made on 2012 july 16.1 ut ( + 45.1 days after main outburst ) using the mike instrument  @xcite on the 6.5 meter magellan clay telescope .",
    "the mike instrument also has two arms , blue ( @xmath24  ) and red ( @xmath25  ) .",
    "two 300 second integrations were taken with a @xmath26 slit , giving a final resolution of @xmath16 in the blue and @xmath27 in the red .",

    "@xcite found an empirical relationship between the ew of eight strong optical dibs and the reddening along a given sight line . in v1324 sco , one of these eight dib features ( 5487.7  ) had very low s / n ( in both vlt and mike spectra ) and was not used , and two features ( 6204.5   and 6283.8  ) were discarded due to overlapping telluric features . the remaining five dibs were used to find a value for @xmath41 .",

    "the final uncertainty in the error weighted average was dominated by the spread in derived @xmath41 values for different dib features .",
    "we used a second , independent , method to determine the reddening .",
    "this method utilized the empirical relationship found by  , which relates reddening to the total equivalent width of the na i d absorption lines ( at 5889.9   and 5895.9 ) and k i absorption line ( at 7698.9  ) .",
    "the material along the line of sight to an object will have some characteristic features due to interstellar absorption , and calibrated two of these features to determine the amount of reddening each feature contributes .",
    "the sum of reddening from individual absorbing features gives the total reddening .",
    "found that the na i d features are ideal for tracing reddening at low column densities , but saturates at high column densities . in these instances the k i feature , which does not saturate as easily , can be used to determine the reddening . in our case",
    ", we only needed to utilize the k i for the two na i d features that were saturated ( at @xmath43 and @xmath44 km / s ) .    to insure that the absorption features were the result of interstellar clouds , and not the nova itself , we compared the uves and mike spectra .",
    "if the features were from the nova , we would expect them to change over time ; as can be seen in the na i d plot , which shows both the uves and mike spectra , the features remained constant .",
    "we did not plot the mike spectra for the k i features , as the s / n was very low .    to avoid potential contamination of the lines with telluric features we used an archived telluric divider to remove telluric features from the uves spectrum .",
    "the ew , derived reddening , and velocity of the absorption features that we used to find the total reddening are given in table  [ tab : naandk ] and figure  [ fig : naandkgrid ] .",
    "although the uncertainty resulting from sum of the measured quantities is @xmath45 , the intrinsic scatter that   found in their calibration was @xmath46 for large reddening values ( @xmath47 ) . as a result , we take @xmath46 to be the uncertainty .",

    "if v1324 sco had a giant companion like v407 cyg then the wind from the companion could explain its exceptionally high gamma - ray luminosity . to determine if this is a feasible explanation we need to determine if the progenitor system to v1324 sco has a giant secondary star .",
    "the strongest photometric constraints on the secondary star comes from the _ vvv _ survey  @xcite , which obtained several epochs of near - ir photometry on the target field between july 2010 and september 2011 .",
    "we searched the catalog for all stars with non - zero @xmath67-band magnitude in a 15@xmath6815 cutout centered on the coordinates of v1324 sco ( @xmath69 ) . to qualify as a star an object had to have a _",
    "value @xmath70 ( see _ vvv _ documentation for a description of the _ pstar _ variable ) . from this sample",

    "however we can say that , if v1324 sco were at a distance of @xmath73 kpc , then the distance modulus would be @xmath74 , meaning that the absolute @xmath67-band limit would be bright enough for the companion to be a very faint giant ( @xmath75 , corresponding to a spectral type g5 giant  @xcite ) .",
    "however , if v1324 sco is at the galactic center ( @xmath76 kpc ) , then it must have a dwarf companion .    while this limit is nt stringent enough to rule out a giant companion , by analyzing the period of v1324 sco we show that the a main sequence companion is strongly favored .",
    "@xcite created a classification system for novae according to their orbital period which is a proxy for luminosity class of the secondary star .",
    "we utilize this classification scheme to help constrain the companion to v1324 sco .",
    "measurements of the binary orbital period were found in the original photometry from the moa group , who detected periodic modulations in the brightness of v1324 sco  @xcite .",
    "these modulations were on the order of @xmath77 mag , with a period of @xmath78 hours .",

    ", we consider both 1.6 and 3.2 hours for the period in our analysis .",
    "interestingly , if the period is 1.6 hours , v1324 sco would be below the period gap , meaning that the angular momentum loss is driven by gravitational radiation  @xcite . only a handful of novae fall below the period gap  @xcite , and it has been postulated that these systems may have a different type of mass transfer mechanism that takes place in this period range  @xcite .",

    "we also found that , while we can not rule out a giant companion , the short period of v1324 sco strongly favors a main sequence companion .",
    "v1324 sco was already the most gamma - ray luminous nova when using the values from  @xcite ; using our new distance limit of @xmath2 , we find that the gamma - ray luminosity is at least a factor of @xmath80 times greater than initially calculated by  @xcite .",
