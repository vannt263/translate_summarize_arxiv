    "gauge theories provide a natural description of interactions between fundamental constituents of matter  @xcite . despite their apparent simplicity , solving gauge theories is generally challenging , a long - standing example being the theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons for the difficulties in solving gauge theories is that they may present non - perturbative effects that are hard to capture within diagrammatic expansions , preventing the application of unbiased analytical approaches to the many - body problem .",

    "the electric - field term @xmath18 is constant , and the system dynamics is described by the competition between the kinetic and the mass term .",
    "this competition leads to the spontaneous breaking of the parity ( p ) and charge - conjugation ( c ) symmetries , defined as    @xmath45    for sufficiently large positive values of @xmath46 , the gauge fields are polarized , @xmath47 ( fig .

    "this state is doubly degenerate , corresponding to the two polarization directions , and breaks c and p.    the transition from the former to the latter scenario is known as _ false vacuum decay_. in a system with open boundary conditions , it leads to the formation of meson bound states at the boundaries . in the fermionic picture ,",

    "we exploited the fact that unwanted transitions between the pseudo - spin levels are avoided as long as the condition @xmath99 is ensured .",
    "for concreteness , we consider the situation where the pseudo - spin is coupled to the radial phonon modes in the @xmath69 direction . to enable this coupling",

    "then , including the eigenenergies of the collective vibrational modes , we obtain a spin  phonon hamiltonian of the form @xcite @xmath116 here , we transformed into an interaction picture with respect to the laser beatnote @xmath117 , in which the eigenfrequencies of the phonon operators are shifted to @xmath118 . moreover , we employed a rotating - wave approximation neglecting terms rotating at frequencies @xmath119 , which is valid for @xmath120 . since @xmath121 , for realistic trap frequencies lying in the range @xmath122mhz , it suffices to consider @xmath123mhz .    for pseudo - spins encoded in an optical quadrupole transition , one can derive an effective hamiltonian equivalent to eq .   by using two laser beams ,",

    "then , to protect gauge invariance , one needs to induce the gauss - law interactions @xmath74 by turning on the corresponding lasers .",
    "afterwards , one can turn on the system dynamics given by @xmath330 , in an adiabatic or an abrupt manner , depending on whether one wants to study ground states or quantum dynamics after a sudden quench .",
    "notably , applying only @xmath331 , without generating @xmath76 , corresponds to a quench from @xmath65 to @xmath212 .",
    "this quench ends in the critical region , which is a highly interesting situation @xcite .",
    "the most important information can be read out easily by measuring the local polarization , i.e. , the occupation of the pseudo - spin levels . from this simple measurement",
    ", one can extract the signature of the parity - breaking phase transition through @xmath332 or @xmath333 . from the corresponding two - point correlations ,",
    "one can compute @xmath334 and thus quantify the breaking of gauge invariance .",
    "complementary observables such as the @xmath69 spin components can be measured by rotating the spins prior to detection .",
    "an important restriction of the proposed scheme is the condition @xmath335 .",
    "a small @xmath57 signifies a slow dynamics , so that one may ask whether physical phenomena associated to the qlm are observable within realistic experimental time scales . for approximately realizing the correct gauge - invariant dynamics",
    ", we require values of @xmath336 ( see sec .",
    "[ cha : numericsshortchains ] ) .",
    "state - of - the - art experiments reach interaction strengths as large as @xmath337khz @xcite .. to retain @xmath337khz in the case of the hyperfine qubits sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]b , one needs an increase of @xmath338 by a factor of @xmath339 for both the @xmath5 and @xmath60 transition ( while increasing the detuning @xmath84 by a factor of @xmath339 to keep a constant off - resonant scattering rate ) .",
    "while challenging , this improvement of laser power seems technically feasible . ]",
    "the corresponding time scale for the system dynamics is @xmath340 .",
    "this is well below the dephasing time , which typically is @xmath291ms and can reach up to @xmath292ms @xcite .",
    "it is also far below realistic relaxation times , which can reach up to @xmath341s @xcite . as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : quench ] , an adiabatic sweep with good fidelity requires only a few ms , so that the c - and - p - breaking transition should be observable in realistic setups .    for small @xmath202 , another type of error might arise in the derivation of the effective spin  spin interactions .",
    "namely , the step from the spin  phonon coupling   to the spin ",
    "spin interaction   involves truncating the canonical transformation   to leading order in @xmath342 .",
    "one could think that higher - order terms neglected when deriving the strong interactions @xmath157 may compete with the first - order terms of weaker interactions such as @xmath175 , eq .  . however , the lamb  dicke parameter is @xmath343 in typical trapped - ion quantum simulations , so that @xmath344 can be easily on the order of @xmath345 @xcite .",
    "consequently , higher - order terms in the canonical transformation are of order @xmath346 @xcite .",
    "we found in sec .",
    "[ cha : numericsshortchains ] that reasonable parameters for @xmath175 are @xmath347 , or equivalently @xmath348 .    generally speaking , the inherent errors discussed in sec .",
    "[ cha : numericsshortchains ] , namely the dipolar terms @xmath244 and gauge - variant contributions to @xmath175 that are not sufficiently suppresed by @xmath204 , will by far dominate over other error sources , such as experimental inaccuracies . for example , for typical experimental parameters , errors due to finite phonon occupation , phonon heating , and micromotion can be estimated to be at most a few percent @xcite .",
    "additional errors , appearing if non - commuting spin  spin interactions are induced simultaneously , are strongly suppressed if the used phonon frequencies are sufficiently different @xcite .",
    "let us also remark that the low - energy , many - body properties of the system are expected to be robust in the presence of small gauge - variant terms ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for a general treatment and a discussion in the context of quantum simulators ) .    in our analysis for the longer chains ( sec .",
    "[ cha : numericsshortchains ] ) , we assumed equidistant ions , but in a realistic linear paul trap this is typically not truly fulfilled , resulting in inhomogeneous coupling strengths . to achieve equal distances , one could employ unharmonic trap potentials , study only the central part of a large ion chain , or resort to individual ion traps @xcite .",
    "however , even if the interactions are not homogeneous , the preservation of gauge invariance enforced by @xmath74 will remain valid , although with a position - dependent strength ( the position - dependence of @xmath157 may possibly even be compensated by the one of @xmath349 , so that @xmath350 remains homogenous ) .",
    "moreover , realistic ion chains are governed by open boundary conditions , while in our numerical calculations of sec .",
    "[ cha : numericsshortchains ] we considered periodic boundary conditions , because these reproduce better the physics of larger systems .",
    "nevertheless , since all involved phases are gapped , we can expect a strong influence of the boundary conditions only close to quantum phase transitions .",
    "the physics of the false - vacuum decay should depend only weakly on the choice of boundary conditions .    finally , let us note that the interactions used in our scheme have , in a different context , all been successfully implemented in experiments .",
    "namely , quantum simulations using hyperfine qubits have been realized employing both the @xmath80 couplings depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]b - c @xcite as well as @xmath188-type spin  spin couplings generated by mlmer  srensen gates @xcite . for optical qubits , high - fidelity gates of @xmath188 type @xcite and @xmath80 type have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "an alternative implementation , based on rf - coupling of hyperfine qubits in spatially varying magnetic fields , has recently also been realized @xcite .",
    "rotations of the coordinate system allow to choose from these coupling schemes the most practical one for a given setup .",
    "for example , it may be simpler to implement @xmath351 than @xmath80 interactions , and to redefine the coordinate system accordingly .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a scheme to realize , with existing technology , a lattice gauge theory in a chain of trapped ions . studying ground - state and dynamical behavior via exact diagonalizations",
    ", we identified the optimal parameter regime for the observation of false - vacuum decay .",
    "an interesting roadmap for experiments would be to demonstrate the basic building block with two or three ions .",
    "then , it could proceed to the proof - of - principle realization of the parity - breaking transition with the use of four ions , and finally aim at a full - fledged quantum simulation on larger ion chains .",
    "our scheme leaves way for adjustment to the concrete experimental situation .",
    "for example , the distinction between matter and gauge - field spins could alternatively by achieved via staggered fields that shift the resonance frequencies for every other spin , or via individual laser addressing , or by separating the ions spatially , e.g. , by employing a narrow zig - zag chain @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if a large number of laser frequencies is available , some of the most prominent errors due to dipolar interactions could be removed by appropriately engineering the spin ",
    "phonon couplings @xcite .",
    "an additional advantage of our scheme is that imperfections in the realization of the gauss law can be monitored by means of post - selection measurement of the local pseudo - spin polarization along the @xmath62-direction .",
    "regarding future perspectives , since the jordan  wigner transformation is only practical in one dimension , it seems to be out of reach for trapped ions to quantum simulate lattice gauge theories of fermionic matter in higher dimensions in an analog setup .",
    "this limitation can be overcome in digital quantum simulations , where the jordan  wigner mapping is useful also in higher dimensions , resulting in a number of gates that scales polynomially with the number of involved fermionic modes @xcite .",
    "while analog quantum simulations have , due to the ` always - on ' nature of interactions , advantages in scalability , digital approaches allow larger control and especially error correction  @xcite . but despite the limitations set by the jordan  wigner transformation , a variety of relevant lattice gauge theories should be accessible to analog quantum simulation in larger dimensions , e.g. , in the two - dimensional ion crystals that can now be realized in experiment @xcite .",
    "interesting examples may include gauge fields coupled to bosonic matter  @xcite , possibly allowing the observation of the higgs mechanism according to the fradkin ",
    "shenker scenario in 2d systems @xcite ( this phenomenon , beyond its intrinsic interest , has drawn particular attention in the context of condensed - matter theory , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting future direction would be the investigation of pure gauge theories , either abelian or non - abelian  @xcite .",
    "the lattice versions of such gauge theories are often directly formulated in the language of spins , which makes trapped - ion setups seem rather promising .",
    "for example , a natural next step would be the quantum simulation of quantum dimer models as are usually obtained from frustrated spin hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "in the shorter term , a number of rather straightforward extensions to the scheme proposed here seems foreseeable .",
    "for example , one could use three different types of pseudo - spins to simulate two flavors of matter fields coupled to a single gauge field . as another conceptually simple generalization",
    ", one could mimic @xmath352 gauge fields by the use of three internal levels @xcite .",
    "finally , it will be interesting to explore alternative possibilities to protect the gauge invariance , e.g. , by the use of classical noise @xcite .",
