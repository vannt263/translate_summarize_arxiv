    "systems composed by few particles having large value of the two - body scattering length , @xmath3 , with respect to the natural length , @xmath4 , fixed by the inter - particle potential , have been the object of an intense investigation both from a theoretical and experimental point of view ( for recent reviews see refs .",
    "the interest is driven by their universal properties ; the behavior of observables do not depend on the microscopical characteristics , namely the inter - particle potential , but only on symmetries .    in the limit @xmath5 , known either as resonant @xmath6 or as scaling @xmath7 limit , the few - particle systems display discrete - scale symmetry as brought out by efimov in his works in the early 70 s  @xcite .",
    "the scaling factor is usually written as @xmath8 , and for three - identical bosons @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this symmetry implies that all observables can be written as an universal log - period function of the dimensionless variable @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a three - body parameter encoding the high - energy ( short distance ) physics , which enters , at leading order , only through this parameter .",
    "the fact that the observables behavior is governed by discrete - scale symmetry is know as efimov physics . for @xmath13 , these properties",
    "have been studied for large positive and large negative values of the scattering length in the @xmath14 plane , with @xmath15^{1/2}$ ] , constructing the efimov plot  @xcite .",
    "this plot is useful in the identification of discrete - scale symmetry ; in fact , if one introduce the radial , @xmath16 , and angular , @xmath17 efimov variables by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the scale invariance reads @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .    in the present work",
    "we extend our previous analysis of the @xmath22 bosonic spectrum  @xcite to the @xmath14 plane .",
    "we have modified the strength of the lm2m2  @xcite potential in order to cover the region of negative values of @xmath3 up to @xmath23 , with this value indicating the threshold of having a three - body system bound .",
    "we have also increased the intensity of the interaction in order to extend the analysis to positive values of @xmath3 in which the universal character of the system starts to be questionable , i.e , when the ground - state @xmath24 approaches the natural energy @xmath25 , which delimits the efimov window .",
    "we used the lm2m2 potential to fix the two - body soft - core potential as in discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite ; this has been possible because of the scale separation between the @xmath1he-@xmath1he scattering length , @xmath26  a.u . , and the natural length @xmath27  a.u . , which is the van der waals length calculated for the lm2m2 potential  @xcite .",
    "in the three - body sector , a three - body soft - core potential is required to reproduce the ground - state - binding energy of the helium trimer given by the lm2m2 potential .",
    "we have performed our numerical calculations in systems with @xmath28 , by means of the non - symmetrized hyperspherical harmonic ( nshh ) expansion method with the technique recently developed by the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the authors have used the hyperspherical harmonic ( hh ) basis , without a previous symmetrization procedure , and on the representation of the hamiltonian matrix , as a sum of products of sparse matrices , well suited for a numerical implementation .    as a result , we have observed that in all the region explored the @xmath29 systems present two states , one deep and one shallow close to the @xmath30 threshold .",
    "this analysis confirms , at least in one zone of the efimov plot , previous observations that each efimov state in the @xmath13 system produces two bound states in the @xmath31 system , and extends this observation to the @xmath32 systems .",
    "in our calculation we used @xmath33 as mass parameter .",
    "the lm2m2 interaction has been modified in the following way @xmath34 and we have varied @xmath35 from @xmath36 , where @xmath37 a.u . , up to @xmath38 corresponding to @xmath39 a.u .",
    "the unitary limit is produced for @xmath40 .",
    "the two - body gaussian ( tbg ) potential is @xmath41 with range @xmath42  a.u . , and we have varied the strength @xmath43 in order to reproduce the values of @xmath3 given by @xmath44 . in the three - body sector",
    "we need an hypercentral - three - body ( h3b ) interaction to better describe the @xmath13 system obtained with the modified lm2m2 potential @xmath45 with the strength @xmath46 tuned to reproduce the trimer energy @xmath47 obtained using @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath48 is the hyperradius of three particles and the range of the three - body force @xmath49",
    "ground and excited states , @xmath50 , as a function of @xmath51 , using the two - body gaussian potential ( upper panel ) , and using the two - body plus the hypercentral three - body force ( lower panel ) . in both panels",

    "[ fig : plot2 ] , the spectrum moves up and we can observe that the excited state @xmath57 disappears for @xmath32 for negative values of the scattering length as @xmath3 approaches @xmath58 . this behaviour is sensitive to the range of the three - body force @xmath59 , and it has been deeply investigated in ref .",

    "[ fig : rapporti ] we investigate the scale invariance using efimov - polar coordinates : for a fixed value of @xmath17 we report the ratio @xmath60 calculated with tbg potential . for negative values of @xmath3 ,",
    "the ratios tend to be constants in agreement with discrete - scale invariance ; we note that , even if the ratio for @xmath13 tends to be constant , the value is lower than the expected @xmath35 . for @xmath61 , which corresponds to the shaded zone in fig .",
    "[ fig : rapporti ] , the non - universal behaviour becomes stronger , and the ratios are no more constants .    to sum up , we have shown that efimov physics for @xmath62 manifests with the existence of two states for @xmath29 , and that the ratio between each pair tends to be constant as a function of the efimov angle @xmath17 ."
