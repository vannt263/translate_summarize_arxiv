    "there has recently been considerable discussion on the phase structure of theories with wilson fermions .",
    "a system of free wilson fermions exhibits a second order phase transition at @xmath0 , @xmath1 being the hopping parameter and @xmath2 the dimensionality .",
    "discussions concern the extent to which this phase transition persists when a bosonic ( e.g. gauge ) field is included . in the schwinger model , with inverse gauge coupling squared @xmath3 , the expectation is that there is a line of phase transitions in the @xmath4 plane extending to the strong coupling limit @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this critical line is also expected to recover massless physics and therein lies the importance in determining its nature and position @xcite    the phase diagram of the schwinger model has been numerically determined by two groups , which , while in rough agreement regarding the location of the critical line , differ in their conclusions regarding its quantitive critical properties . using lee  yang zeroes , finite ",
    "size scaling and other techniques the results of @xcite support the free boson scenario , where the model lies in the same universality class as the ising model , with critical exponents @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "this is not in agreement with @xcite where finite ",
    "size scaling of lee  yang zeroes on larger lattices provides evidence for @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "we analytically determine the phase structure in the weakly coupled regime .",
    "we find that the zeroes in the schwinger model with fixed weak gauge coupling display unusual behaviour , do not accumulate on the real axis and may not , in fact , lead to a phase transition .",
    "the behaviour of these zeroes is , however , such as to mimic the appearance of a phase transition when a finite  size analysis is restricted to small or moderate lattices .",
    "applying our method to the @xmath10 gross  neveu model yields results consistent with aoki s saddle point analysis @xcite and this consistency adds confidence to our new analytic approach .",
    "we consider a @xmath10 lattice of spacing @xmath11 and @xmath12 sites in each direction . for the fermion fields , we impose antiperiodic ( periodic ) boundary conditions in the @xmath13- ( @xmath14- ) direction .",
    "the fourier transformed fermion fields then have momenta @xmath15 where @xmath16 is half  integer and @xmath17 is integer .",
    "the action is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 this fermion matrix consists of free and interacting parts , @xmath21 with @xmath22 given by @xmath23 in ( [ 3.5 ] ) . here",
    "@xmath24 is the link variable .",
    "the partition function is @xmath25 , the integration over fermions having been performed .",
    "the gauge action is @xmath26 } $ ] , where @xmath27 is the product of link variables around a plaquette , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a pure gauge expectation .    for @xmath30 ,",
    "the partition function is simply proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "then the free partition function can be written in terms of its eigenvalues @xmath32 which are either 2fold ( @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) or 4fold degenerate . in this case , and with @xmath35 , the zeroes are @xmath36 .",
    "the lowest zero with finite real part in @xmath1 has @xmath37 .",
    "pinching of the positive real finite hopping parameter axis occurs at @xmath38 and application of finite ",
    "size scaling to the imaginary parts of the zero gives the critical exponent @xmath39 ( @xmath7 then follows from hyperscaling ) .",
    "therefore the free fermion model is in the same universality class as the ising model in two dimensions and describes free bosons .",
    "the weak coupling expansion is obtained by expanding the link variables @xmath40 as a power series in @xmath41 .",
    "the fermion determinant can then be expanded giving the ` traditional ' form for the weak coupling expansion ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this expansion is analytic in @xmath42 with poles at @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "an alternative formulation of the partition function may be obtained by writing the fermion matrix as @xmath44 .",
    "the determinant @xmath45 is a polynomial in @xmath42 for finite lattice size .",
    "therefore its pure gauge expectation value is also a polynomial in @xmath42 and may be written @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 represent @xmath48 and are the zeroes in the complex @xmath49 plane .",
    "we may write a ` multiplicative ' weak coupling expansion as @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the shifts that occur in the zeroes when the gauge field is turned on . note that ( [ multiplicative ] ) is analytic in @xmath42 with poles at @xmath52 . since the multiplicative expression ( [ multiplicative ] )",
    "must be the same as the ` traditional ' weak coupling expansion , the residues of the poles must be equal .",
    "equating these residues gives the the shifts in the positions of the zeroes in the two fold degenerate case ( the case of four fold degeneracies is more complicated but we expect the lowest zeroes to be erstwhile two fold degenerate ) . in this way",
    ", the shifts in the positions of the lowest zeroes are determined to @xmath53 .",
    "our calculation of pure gauge expectation values is done in feynman gauge .",
    "a standard numerical technique for determination of the phase diagram is to approximate the critical point by the real part of the lowest zero for some large lattice . plotted against @xmath3",
    "this approximates the phase diagram . in figure  1",
    "we present such a plot for @xmath54 ( circles ) to compare with the results of @xcite ( crosses ) also at @xmath54 .",
    "the phase diagram of @xcite for the schwinger model with _ two _ fermion flavours coming from a separate pcac based analysis is also included ( squares ) for comparison .",
    "figure  2 is a finite  size scaling plot for the lowest zero at @xmath55 and @xmath56  @xmath57 coming from our weak coupling analysis ( circles ) .",
    "the corresponding data from the numerical analysis of @xcite are also included ( crosses ) .",
    "the two lines are linear fits to the first and second zeroes for lattice sizes @xmath58 which are those analysed in @xcite . these yield slopes",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively , corresponding to @xmath61 .",
    "a similar plot may be made to compare with the numerical results of @xcite who use @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "there , the best linear fit gives @xmath64 compatable with @xmath13 .",
    "fitting to our small lattice data also gives @xmath65 .",
    "thus we find that confining the finite  size scaling analysis to the range @xmath66  @xmath67 yields @xmath68 in agreement with @xcite while a corresponding analysis with @xmath56@xmath69 gives @xmath70 in agreement with @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the figure , however , that the curve does not in fact settle to a finite  size scaling line .",
    "instead as @xmath12 increases , the lowest zeroes cross the real axis .",
    "the first two zeroes therefore fail to accumulate and do not contribute to critical behaviour @xcite .",
    "these zeroes are isolated singularities , having measure zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "although the possibility of existence of isolated singularities and non  accumulation of partition function zeroes has been known for a long time @xcite , this is to our knowledge the first instance where such behaviour has been observed .",
    "we have also applied our new analytic technique to the two dimensional gross ",
    "neveu model @xcite .",
    "there we find the expected accumulation of zeroes and a weakly coupled phase diagram which is consistent with that determined by aoki using a saddle point approach @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a new method to analytically determine the lee  yang zeroes of weakly coupled theories . in the free case , there is a phase transition precipitated by the accumulation of lee  yang zeroes on the real hopping parameter axis . in the weakly",
    "coupled lattice schwinger model at fixed @xmath3 , this accumulation no longer occurs for the first couple of zeroes . instead , the movement of these zeroes for small and moderately sized lattices mimics phase transition like behaviour .",
    "as the lattice size becomes large , however , these zeroes move across the real axis , and do not give rise to a phase transition . in the gross ",
    "neveu case , our phase diagram is consistent with aoki s saddle point analysis @xcite .",
