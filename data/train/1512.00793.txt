    "one of the most promising subfields of spintronics is organic spintronics,@xcite which exploits organic materials to manipulate and control spin currents .",
    "recently , this emerging field has experienced a significant progress with the remarkable discovery of spin - dependent transport through chiral organic molecules at room temperature .",
    "this so - called chiral - induced spin selectivity ( ciss ) effect has been first observed in double - stranded dna molecules ( dsdna).@xcite whereas dsdna molecules were found to act as highly efficient spin filters , no ciss effect was found in single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) molecules.@xcite however , recent experiments found spin polarization of electrons transmitted through a bacteriorhodopsin ( br),@xcite a protein composed of seven parallel single @xmath0-helices , when the br was embedded in a purple membrane which was adsorbed on a variety of substrates .",
    "these experiments have proved that the ciss effect results from the intrinsic properties of the helical molecules , and is almost independent of the substrate.@xcite additionally , a self - assembled monolayer of a different @xmath0-helical protein was used to demonstrate the operation of a chiral - based magnetic memory.@xcite    following these experimental observations , several groups have attempted to explain the theory behind the ciss effect.@xcite in one approach , tight - binding models are used to study electron transport through helical molecules in the presence of spin - orbit interaction ( soi).@xcite in a second approach , a spin - dependent scattering problem is solved in a three - dimensional potential with chiral helical symmetry.@xcite the authors of ref .   studied the effect of strong soi in a metallic substrate on the spin polarization of photoelectrons due to angular momentum selection .",
    "a natural source of spin polarization is the soi.@xcite on a one - dimensional ( 1d ) wire , this interaction can be removed by a gauge transformation.@xcite the effect of soi becomes non - trivial if one allows for quantum interference , via more than one electronic path .",
    "the simplest model of a spin filter is thus a two - path interferometer.@xcite however , when the interferometer is connected to a single input and output 1d single - mode leads there is no spin polarization unless one breaks time - reversal symmetry.@xcite this fact stems from symmetry considerations of the scattering matrix,@xcite which show that the combination of unitarity and time - reversal symmetry leads to a twofold degeneracy of transmission eigenvalues.@xcite due to this kramers degeneracy of transmission eigenvalues , a finite spin polarization is forbidden in a two - terminal setup with single - mode leads.@xcite indeed , spin filtering does arise from the competition between the soi and a magnetic aharonov - bohm flux.@xcite alternatively , it has been shown that spin polarization can be obtained in a two - terminal interferometer in the absence of magnetic flux , by assuming leakage of electrons from the interferometer to the environment , via side leads.@xcite as shown earlier , such a leakage breaks unitarity , and gives rise to complex site self - energies.@xcite some of these physical sources for spin polarization have been used in the literature .",
    "reference has introduced hopping between further neighbor sites along the helix , which gives rise to quantum interference .",
    "the recent observation of the ciss effect in protein - like helical molecules,@xcite as opposed to ssdna molecules , was attributed to the differences in such terms between these two systems.@xcite apparently , the hopping amplitudes in the protein - like helical molecules are larger than those in the ssdna due to smaller distances between the nucleobases .",
    "references also introduced phase - breaking processes ( either via bttiker probes@xcite or via complex potentials in the hamiltonian@xcite ) .",
    "the latter processes may indeed result from the experimentally observed electron capture by dna molecules.@xcite    in this paper we present a simple tight - binding model for non - unitary electronic transport through a single helical molecule , which contains soi on the nearest neighbor ( nn ) bonds along the helix , and quantum interference , generated via hopping of electrons to the neighboring sites parallel to the helix axis .",
    "the unitarity is broken by allowing for leakage of electrons to side leads , which are connected to each site on the helix .",
    "we expect similar results for any model which generates complex site self - energies on the helix sites .",
    "the simplicity of the model allows an analytical solution , including a systematic analysis of the roles played by the various physical processes .",

    "such an enhanced soi may result from band structure effects ( e.g.  a smaller effective mass ) , as in narrow - gap semiconductors with strong rashba soi.@xcite however , the details of the mechanism for strong soi in chiral helical molecules are yet to be clarified .    equations and can be used to investigate the spin polarization along an arbitrary direction [ see eq .  ] .",
    "in particular , the experimentally measurable spin polarization along the @xmath143-axis , @xmath203 , is of special interest .",
    "experiments reveal that this quantity differs by a sign for molecules with opposite chiralities .",
    "this observation is analytically reproduced by our model ; the polarization along the @xmath143-axis is given by eq .",
    "with @xmath204 , that is @xmath205 combining eqs .",
    "and one finds that @xmath206 , and hence @xmath203 , reverses sign when the chirality is reversed .",
    "we have presented a simple tight - binding model for electron transport in the presence of soi in which spin polarization is generated by non - unitary hopping .",
    "our model takes interference of electronic waves into account by considering hopping terms beyond nn ones .",
    "although our model resembles that of refs .   and , there are several important differences .",
    "first , we consider only two hopping paths at each site .",
    "this simplifies the model and allows an analytical solution .",
    "one can then study in more detail the direction of maximum spin polarization .",
    "second , we allow arbitrary soi interactions on the bonds within each unit cell , which may imitate the internal structure of the helical molecules .",
    "this also makes our model applicable to other systems such as mesoscopic interferometers made of narrow - gap semiconductors with strong soi .",
    "third , our mechanism for the generation of a complex self - energy , due to electron leakage to side leads , differs from those of refs .   and .",
    "at first look , our non - unitary effect may seem artificial .",
    "however , such a leakage out of the helical molecules and into the surrounding environment may in fact be the cause for the observed decay of the total current through the molecules with the molecule s length .",
    "interestingly , our model also reproduces the experimentally observed increase in the spin polarization with the molecule s length .",
    "our leakage may also mimic in a very simplified way complex effects such as electron capturing by dna molecules,@xcite as well as a variety of other phase - breaking processes .",
    "in general , a given microscopic phase - breaking mechanism ( e.g. , electron - electron or electron - phonon interactions ) can be incorporated by a suitable choice of the complex self - energy function using the non - equilibrium green s function formalism .",
    "however , phase - breaking processes are usually introduced by relatively simple phenomenological models.@xcite one phenomenological model for the inclusion of such processes was proposed by bttiker,@xcite in which phase - breaking processes are modelled by an additional electron reservoir coupled to the system via fictitious voltage probes , subject to the condition of zero net current .",
    "these bttiker probes remove electrons from the phase - coherent region and subsequently reinject them without any phase relationship .",
    "another phenomenological model introduces phase - breaking processes by adding a spatially uniform pure imaginary potential to the hamiltonian.@xcite the latter model is similar to our approach .",
    "these two models were compared in ref .   and the limit in which they are equivalent was identified . in the context of the ciss effect , the authors of refs .   and employed bttiker s method , whereas in ref .",
    "a phenomenological imaginary potential was introduced . in terms of the tight - binding formalism used here ,",
    "both methods are expected to give a complex site self - energy which results in a spin splitting as discussed above .",
    "the analytical solution of our simple model also suggests that one may achieve a larger ciss effect by measuring the spin polarization along an axis different from the @xmath143-axis , conventionally used to measure the ciss effect .",
    "we identify the direction of this axis in terms of the soi strength and the geometrical parameters characterizing the helix .",
    "finally , we show analytically that the spin polarization along the @xmath143-axis changes sign when the chirality of the helix is reversed , also in agreement with experiments .",
    "as we noted , coupling the molecule to two terminals and assuming time - reversal symmetry can not yield a non - zero spin polarization . in some sense",
    ", our leakage model overcomes this problem by adding many more terminals , in which the electrons only go away from the molecule .",
    "an alternative way to achieve a non - zero spin polarization is to use a multi - terminal setup , namely a system with more than single input and output leads.@xcite in the context of our model one may consider @xmath2 input and output leads , connected to each of the @xmath2 sites in the leftmost and rightmost cells ( @xmath81 and @xmath83 ) .",
    "such a model , which does not break unitarity , will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with r. naaman and k. michaeli .",
    "this work was supported by the israeli science foundation ( isf ) and by the infrastructure program of israel ministry of science and technology under contract 3 - 11173 .",
