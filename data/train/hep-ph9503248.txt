    "experimental evidence suggests that neutrino masses are very small , if not zero .",
    "however , the way the standard model of electroweak interactions ( sm ) accommodates massless neutrinos , by the absence of right - handed neutrino fields , is considered unnatural .",
    "interesting solutions to this problem have been suggested in the low energy limit of superstring theories@xcite , and in grand unified theories ( guts)@xcite . naturally small neutrino masses may even be accommodated within the framework of the @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "either the fermion content of the sm or the higgs sector may be extended . in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on the former option .",
    "we consider an @xmath2 based , superstring - inspired model with an extended fermion sector including neutral heavy leptons ( nhls)@xcite . the nhl s are dirac particles and b ",
    "l ( baryon minus lepton number ) conservation is imposed as an unbroken symmetry .",
    "this is in contrast to see - saw models @xcite wherein both light neutrinos and nhl s are majorana particles and b ",
    "l is broken .",
    "the model considered allows for the possibilities of lepton - flavor violation , universality violation , and cp violation .",
    "our primary interest here is in obtaining potential constraints on the model from current experimental data on @xmath0 leptonic decay widths .",
    "we focus on the direct contribution of nhl s to flavor - conserving leptonic @xmath0 decays via one - loop diagrams .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0 partial widths for individual lepton flavors , we also calculate a measure of the leptonic universality violation , as defined in ref.6 .",
    "further , we find that we must take into account the impact of nhl s on the mass of the @xmath1 boson since @xmath3 is an input parameter within the renormalization scheme adopted here .",
    "hence , we display also the dependence of @xmath3 on the parameters of our model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we describe the model . existing experimental constraints on the parameters of the model , namely the masses and mixings of the neutral leptons , are reviewed in sec .",
    "our one - loop calculation of the @xmath0 leptonic decay , @xmath4 , is presented in sec .",
    "this section also contains a discussion of our renormalization scheme , including the consideration of @xmath3 .",
    "many of the detailed results are relegated to an appendix . in sec .  [ results ] , we present our results on the @xmath0 leptonic widths , the universality violating measure , and the @xmath1 mass .",
    "we summarize and draw our conclusions in the final section .",
    "originally , only broken b ",
    "l symmetry and majorana neutrinos were thought of as providing an understanding of the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "however , as discussed in ref .  4 , superstring inspired models can have small neutrino masses ( in fact , zero ) even if b  l symmetry is unbroken and nhl s are dirac particles . in these models ,",
    "the sm particle content is extended by two new neutrino fields , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , per family ; the zeros indicate @xmath2 quantum numbers . imposing total lepton number conservation leads to the mass matrix @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "d and m are @xmath10 mass matrices .",
    "the diagonalization of the mass matrix yields three massless neutrinos ( @xmath11 ) along with three dirac nhl s ( @xmath12 ) of mass @xmath13 .",
    "note that this implies there are no time dependent neutrino oscillations and no neutrinoless double beta decays .",
    "the weak eigenstates @xmath14 are mostly massless neutrinos with a small mixing ( @xmath15 ) of nhl s .",
    "the nhl mixing in this model is not restricted by small neutrino masses ( as is often the case with see - saw models where both the mixing and the masses of light neutrinos are sensitive to the @xmath16 ratio ) , and hence rates for all interesting phenomena can be large @xcite .",
    "this model is thus attractive not only conceptually , but also practically .",
    "the weak interaction eigenstates @xmath14 are related to six mass eigenstates @xmath17 via a @xmath18 mixing matrix @xmath19 with components @xmath20 ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 after rotating away redundant degrees of freedom from @xmath19 , we are left with @xmath24 angles and @xmath25 phases .",
    "this allows for possible lepton - flavor violation , universality violation and cp violation .",

    "the charged current lagrangian is given by    @xmath30    and the neutral current lagrangian as ( the @xmath31 part is obtained by analogy ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 being the weinberg angle .",
    "constraints on neutral heavy lepton masses and mixings come from three different sources .",
    "first , there is the possibility of direct production of nhl s .",
    "for instance , if an nhl is light enough , it could be produced in some decays , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath35 , and subsequently decay itself .",
    "the rate for @xmath0 decays into an nhl and a light neutrino has been given previously@xcite as    @xmath36    where    @xmath37    the subsequent nhl decay rate ( for @xmath38 ) is then given by    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the muon decay rate and @xmath41 is the effective number of decay channels available to the nhl@xcite .",
    "given the absence of experimental evidence for such direct production , we will consider only nhls with mass greater than the @xmath0 mass .",
    "secondly , there are constraints on nhl mixing parameters from a variety of low energy experiments and from experiments at the cern large electron positron collider i ( lep i ) . due to unitarity properties of the mixing matrix @xmath19",
    ", a nonzero nhl mixing slightly reduces the couplings of light neutrinos from their standard model values , thus affecting rates for nuclear @xmath42 decays , @xmath43 and @xmath44 decays , and for @xmath0 decays .",
    "the following upper limits are consistent with experiment@xcite    @xmath45[c]{or } \\leq 0.024   \\makebox[1.5in][r]{including lep i}\\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these limits are model independent and also independent of the nhl mass .",
    "they arise from a global analysis of results including lepton universality experiments , cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) unitarity tests , @xmath1 mass measurements and results from lep i experiments .",
    "note that the lep constraints presented above do not include nhl loop effects but , rather , only coupling constant modifications due to mixing .",
    "we consider nhl loop effects in this work .",
    "finally , the nhl masses and mixings can be constrained via their contribution in loops to various processes .",
    "such constraints are nhl mass dependent .",
    "flavor - violating processes have previously been studied at low energies ; these include @xmath46 , @xmath47@xcite and flavor violating decays of the @xmath43@xcite .",
    "for instance , in the context of the model considered here , with mass degenerate nhls , the @xmath46 branching ratio is @xcite    @xmath48    where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is an nhl mass dependent form factor . for nhl masses @xmath51 gev , which we will ultimately consider , @xmath52 . given the current experimental limit on the @xmath46 branching ratio ( @xmath53 4.9 x @xmath54)@xcite , this yields an upper limit on the mixing of    @xmath55 ) one obtains the following upper limits on the mixing factors    @xmath56 and @xmath57 , these are the strongest available constraints .",
    "in addition , flavor - violating leptonic @xmath0 decays , @xmath58 , have also been studied @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we consider the flavor - conserving decays @xmath59 .",
    "as noted previously , the limits on mixing parameters extracted from lep i observables@xcite do not include nhl s in the one - loop diagrams ; only mixing factor modifications are made to the tree level results .",
    "we consider here the direct contribution to flavour conserving leptonic @xmath0 decay of nhl s via one - loop diagrams .",
    "the importance of studying these processes is enhanced by the implication of eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 ] ) ; one may observe flavor - conserving ( but universality breaking ) @xmath0 decays even in the absence of flavour violating processes .    for @xmath0 leptonic decay ,",
    "nhls contribute directly to @xmath0 oblique corrections , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , to lepton wave function renormalizations and to vertex corrections , as in fig .",
    "these one - loop contributions of nhl s can be incorporated into the framework of the full standard model one - loop electroweak corrections . the one - loop corrected leptonic width",
    "can be parametrized as @xcite    @xmath60    where the tree level leptonic width of the @xmath0 boson is given by    @xmath61    @xmath62 and @xmath63 being respectively the vector and axial vector couplings of charged leptons to @xmath0 .",
    "the one - loop electroweak corrections include @xmath64 , which represent vertex loops , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 which represent the @xmath0-oblique corrections and qed corrections respectively .",
    "our calculation is done within the framework of an on - shell renormalization scheme as detailed in ref . 15 .",
    "all the sm one - loop diagrams were calculated using standard routines from the cern electroweak library@xcite modified by appropriate mixing factors .",
    "the vertex parameter @xmath67 actually includes also fermion wave function renormalization and counterterm contributions in the scheme we adopt .",
    "this on - shell renormalization scheme takes @xmath68 and @xmath3 as input parameters .",
    "however , the direct measurement of @xmath3 is not yet precise enough for its use as an input parameter ; hence , it is replaced by @xmath69 via the one - loop relation    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is an equivalent of the sm quantity @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . as a result , we also have to consider muon decay loops with nhl s .",
    "the types of corrections involved in muon decay are pictured schematically in fig .",
    "they include boxes and vertices with nhl s as well as the lepton wave function renormalizations and @xmath1 oblique corrections .",
    "the nhl diagrams contributing to the @xmath1 oblique corrections are shown in fig . 1 along with the @xmath0 oblique corrections .",
    "these corrections all feed into the @xmath0 leptonic decay calculation indirectly via the dependence of @xmath3 on the parameter @xmath71 and the overall factor modified by mixings .    referring to eq .",

    "they consist of @xmath83 dependent terms representing the direct contribution from nhl s in loops in fig . 1 and of sm terms modified by mixing factors ( the indirect effect of nhl s reducing the mixings of light neutrinos through the unitary matrix @xmath19 )",
    ".    the vertex parameter @xmath84 includes @xmath85 mixing , external fermion wave function renormalization , and counterterm contributions in addition to the vertex loops involving nhl s .",
    "those fermion self energy and @xmath86 vertex loops which contain nhls are shown in figs .",
    "the individual contributions of figs .",
    "2a - j are given in eq .",
    "( a6 ) in the appendix .",
    "it is characteristic that nhl s in loops generally do not decouple ( violation of the appelquist - carazzone theorem)@xcite ; rather they often show a quadratic mass dependence @xmath87 .",
    "this is a common feature for theories based on the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "we are already familiar with a similar result for the top quark mass in sm loops@xcite .",
    "indirect bounds on the top quark mass arise from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 polarization diagrams and @xmath88 vertex loop since these corrections come in with the amplitude @xmath89 while the top quark mixes with the full strength ( @xmath90 ) , the nhl mixings are limited by eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 14 ) . as a result ,",
    "we find sensitivity only for @xmath91 . thus we will only present numerical results for nhl masses greater than about 500 gev .    given the nondecoupling feature ,",
    "the vertex correction @xmath92 is dominated for large nhl masses by the diagrams ( in decreasing order of importance ) 2j , 2f and 2e , while 2a - b , 2c - d , 2 g , 2h and 2i are negligible ( the largest unrenormalized contribution comes from 2 g and 2c - d ; however , diagrams 2c - d enter the renormalized vertex correction @xmath92 as a part of a counterterm that cancels out the large amplitude of the graph 2 g ) .    to illustrate how @xmath93 and @xmath71 depend on @xmath83 ( for @xmath83 large )",

    "in this section , we present our numerical results . as input parameters , we used @xmath107 gev , @xmath108 gev , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",

    "we have presented the dependence on the mass and mixing parameters of this model for @xmath0 decays to charged leptons and for the @xmath1 boson mass . because the nhl mass and mixing dependence is different for the @xmath0 decay width and the @xmath1 boson mass , they provide somewhat complementary information on these parameters .",
