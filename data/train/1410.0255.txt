    "it is often the case that one is given a high dimensional distribution @xmath0 , which is known only up to normalizing constants , a state space @xmath1 and an observable @xmath2 and the goal is to compute an integral of the form @xmath3 .",
    "typically , such integrals can not be computed in closed forms , so one has to resort to approximations .",
    "what is typically done is to construct a markov process @xmath4 , which has @xmath5 as its invariant distribution . then under the assumption of positive recurrence ,",
    "the ergodic theorem guarantees that for any @xmath6 , @xmath7 then , the estimator @xmath8 is used to approximate the integral of interest .",
    "however , the degree of accuracy of such an approximation depends on both the choice of the markov process @xmath4 and on the criterion used for comparison .",
    "let us assume that @xmath0 is of gibbs type on the state space @xmath1 and in particular that @xmath9 a markov process that has @xmath5 as its invariant distribution is the time - reversible langevin diffusion @xmath10 however , as it has been argued in the literature @xcite , it is advantageous to use appropriate irreversible diffusions of the form @xmath11dt+\\sqrt{2\\beta}dw_{t}\\ ] ] and if the vector fields @xmath12 satisfy @xmath13 or equivalently @xmath14 then the measure @xmath5 is still invariant .",
    "the main result of @xcite is that under certain conditions the absolute value of the second largest eigenvalue of the markov semigroup in @xmath15 decreases when @xmath16 , which naturally implies faster convergence to equilibrium . in @xcite ,",
    "the donsker - varadhan large deviations rate function @xcite has been proposed as a natural tool to compare the convergence to equilibrium for ergodic averages and it was used to analyze parallel tempering type algorithms . in @xcite , this criterion is used as a guide to design and analyze non - reversible markov processes and compare them with reversible ones .",
    "it is proven that the large deviations rate function monotonically increases under the addition of an irreversible drift .",
    "moreover upon connecting the large deviations rate function with the asymptotic variance of the estimator , it is proven in @xcite , that adding a drift @xmath12 also decreases the asymptotic variance of the estimator , in the sense that @xmath17 is smaller than the asymptotic variance with @xmath18 , i.e , smaller than @xmath19 .",
    "the goal of the current work is to study the situation when the additional drift has the form @xmath20 and to consider what happens when @xmath21 .",
    "a similar question but from a different perspective has been studied in @xcite . there , the authors studied the behavior of the spectral gap for diffusions on compact manifolds with @xmath22 and a one - parameter families of perturbations @xmath23 for some divergence free vector field @xmath12 . in those papers",
    "the behavior of the spectral gap is related to the ergodic properties of the flow generated by @xmath12 ( for example if the flow is weak - mixing then the second largest eigenvalue tends to @xmath24 as @xmath21 ) . in the present paper",
    "we want to understand the effect that increasing @xmath25 has on the asymptotic variance and on the paths of @xmath4 .",
    "we find that the asymptotic variance of the estimator is monotonically decreasing in @xmath26 . using an averaging argument , we characterize the limiting asymptotic variance as @xmath27 . focusing on the case where the potential @xmath28 has one or more critical points ,",
    "the irreversible perturbations with a small @xmath29 induce a fast motion on the constant potential surface and slow motion in the orthogonal direction . using the theory of diffusions on graphs and the related averaging principle as developed in a series of works @xcite , we identify the limiting motion of the slow component .",
    "the fast motion on constant potential surfaces decreases the variance as the phase space is explored faster .",
    "the limit of the asymptotic variance as @xmath30 is the asymptotic variance of a one - dimensional estimation problem on a graph , which is where the slow component of the process lives in the limit as @xmath27 . upon completion of this work ,",
    "we became aware of the recent paper @xcite where an alternative expression of the limiting asymptotic variance is provided , see also remark [ r : resultofhwang ] .",
    "the methods of @xcite are analytical and the characterization of the limiting variance is expressed as the projection to a kernel of a certain operator .",
    "our approach provides complementary information and is dynamical since we are using an averaging principle which allows us to make direct connections with the limiting behavior of the underlying process itself , relating the limiting variance with an estimation problem on an one - dimensional graph .",
