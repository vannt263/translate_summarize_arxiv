    "among the many different experimental approaches towards understanding the particle nature of dark matter , direct - detection experiments are the only ones which directly probe the actual scattering of dark matter against ordinary standard - model ( sm ) matter . in general ,",
    "such experiments seek to observe the infrequent scatterings of galactic - halo dark matter with atomic nuclei by searching for unambiguous evidence of the resulting nuclear recoils  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of such scattering events would arguably provide the most compelling possible evidence for the existence of dark matter , and would represent a major step towards the all - important goal of discerning the nature of the underlying dynamics that connects dark matter to the visible world .",
    "that direct - detection experiments are capable of such powers of discernment is a direct consequence of the fact that different coupling structures between dark matter and ordinary standard - model matter yield significantly different scattering phenomenologies . as a result",
    ", any analysis of the experimental prospects for a given direct - detection experiment will inevitably rely on certain assumptions concerning the types of couplings that lead to this scattering . since the interactions between the dark and visible sectors are by definition suppressed , one well - motivated possibility is that these two sectors are coupled by high - scale dynamics which gives rise to effective contact interactions at the energy scales relevant for direct detection .",
    "although the consequences of couplings between dark matter and standard - model leptons have certainly been studied in the prior literature ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it is far more common to consider elastic contact interactions between dark matter and sm quarks or gluons  @xcite .",
    "this preference is ultimately motivated by the recognition that direct - detection experiments are designed to capitalize on scattering between dark matter and atomic nuclei . in this paper",
    "we shall focus on couplings to quarks .",
    "indeed , for a ( dirac ) fermionic dark - matter particle @xmath3 , such contact interactions typically involve bilinear coupling structures of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes a standard - model quark and where @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent different possible choices of dirac gamma - matrix combinations @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 . different choices for @xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to different lorentz and parity properties for the underlying interactions , and",
    "can thus lead to drastically different dark - matter phenomenologies ( and therefore different predictions for associated event rates ) at direct - detection experiments .",
    "for this reason , coupling structures which lead to attractive phenomenologies and greater event rates tend to be studied ubiquitously in the dark - matter literature , while those leading to suppressed event rates are typically neglected .    unfortunately , by neglecting certain operators within this class",
    ", we are leaving many  stones unturned \" in the hunt for dark matter .",
    "in particular , it may turn out that certain coupling structures which are seemingly suppressed ( and thus are not considered ) are actually enhanced by other factors .",
    "such enhancements could conceivably overcome the apparent suppressions associated with these operators , implying that the contributions from such operators are not negligible after all .    in this work ,",
    "we show that this is indeed the case for _ pseudoscalar _ coupling structures between dark matter and sm particles .",
    "the standard lore is that such coupling structures lead to direct - detection event rates which are suppressed relative to those associated with similar axial - vector coupling structures by factors of the @xmath3/nucleus relative velocity @xmath13 .",
    "however , one of the main points of this paper is to emphasize that there is a corresponding mitigating factor that can potentially overcome this velocity suppression : the process of transitioning from a fundamental pseudoscalar _ quark _ coupling to an effective pseudoscalar _",
    "coupling introduces into the corresponding dark - matter scattering rate additional factors of order @xmath0 , where @xmath14 are the masses of the corresponding quarks and nucleons .",
    "such enhancements , for example , are not present for axial - vector interactions , which are in some ways the closest cousins to the pseudoscalar interactions . in addition , we find that both axial - vector and pseudoscalar couplings are further enhanced in cases in which the dark - matter couplings are ultimately isospin - violating , with these enhancements becoming particularly striking in the case of pseudoscalar interactions .",
    "thus , contrary to popular lore , we conclude that pseudoscalar couplings between dark matter and standard - model matter can indeed be probed at dark - matter direct - detection experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we discuss the origins of the quark - to - nucleon enhancement factor that emerges for pseudoscalar interactions , and provide a careful analysis of the corresponding uncertainties that are inherent in such calculations .",
    "we also demonstrate that the possibility of isospin - violating pseudoscalar interactions only enhances these couplings further .",
    "we then proceed to present a model - independent analysis of pseudoscalar interactions at direct - detection experiments . in so doing",
    ", we also identify those portions of the corresponding dark - matter parameter space which can be probed at current and future experiments of this type .",
    "we begin by discussing the matrix elements and couplings that describe the contact interactions between fermionic dark matter and ordinary standard - model matter .",
    "this will also serve to introduce our notation and provide a point of comparison between interactions involving different lorentz and parity structures .",
    "ultimately , we shall focus on the cases of axial - vector and pseudoscalar interactions .",
    "it turns out that these two cases are closely related , yet have different resulting phenomenologies .      in general",
    ", we shall assume that our dark matter is a dirac fermion @xmath3 whose dominant couplings to the visible sector are to standard - model quarks through dimension - six four - fermi contact interactions described by lagrangian operators of the bilinear form _",

    "the tree - level matrix element describing this @xmath42 scattering is therefore given by @xmath43 where @xmath41 denotes the particular nucleon species in question ( either proton @xmath44 or neutron @xmath45 ) .",
    "note that because the dark matter is a @xmath28 singlet , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are both of the same species @xmath41 and possibly differ only in their momenta and/or spins as the result of the scattering .",
    "the same will be assumed true for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , even in cases such as those in refs .",
    "@xcite in which the dark sector has multiple components .    in general ,",
    "the nucleonic matrix element of the quark current @xmath50 can not be evaluated analytically within a nucleonic background defined by @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "indeed , to do so would require a complete understanding of the manner in which the quark degrees of freedom are directly mapped onto those of the nucleon through the non - perturbative process of confinement .",
    "however , it is conventional to make the assumption that the nucleonic matrix element of the quark current is proportional to that of the corresponding _ nucleon _ current in the limit of vanishing momentum transfer  @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 represents a fixed constant of proportionality that encapsulates the non - perturbative physics inherent in low - energy qcd .",
    "indeed , this constant of proportionality is assumed to depend on the quark and nucleon in question , and also the specific choice of the dirac - matrix structure @xmath53 involved , but is otherwise assumed to be independent of all other relevant variables ( such as the particular spin and velocity configurations of the initial and final @xmath46 and @xmath47 states ) . in practice , the values of @xmath52 for the different relevant cases are calculated numerically through lattice gauge - theory techniques and/or extracted experimentally .",
    "we should emphasize , however , that the relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spinfraction ] ) holds only as an approximate phenomenological `` rule of thumb '' , and comes with several correction terms which can be taken to be small or even vanishing in various limits .",

    "we then find @xmath54 where the final dark - matter / nucleon coupling @xmath55 is given by g_n   _ q c_q ^(xy ) q^(n )  .",
    "[ gchincouplings ]    in this paper , we shall be concerned with three particular dirac - matrix bilinears : the scalar ( s ) , the pseudoscalar ( p ) , and the axial vector ( a ) . in the non - relativistic limit",
    ", the scalar bilinear matrix element behaves to leading order as :   _ f | | _ i  ~   2 m _ ( _ ^s)^_^s  , [ scalarnorm ] where @xmath56 represents the two - component spinor corresponding to the fermion @xmath57 with spin @xmath58 , and where @xmath58 and @xmath59 represent the spins of @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",

    "taking @xmath57 to correspond to our nucleon field @xmath41 , we thus see that both the pseudoscalar and axial - vector cases lead to a _ spin - dependent _ scattering amplitude to leading order .",
    "it is for this reason that the coefficients @xmath52 for these cases can be interpreted as characterizing the fraction of the spin of the nucleon @xmath41 that is carried by the quark @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , in the case of pseudoscalar couplings , it is easy to show that _ all _ terms  and not just those at leading order  are spin - dependent ; this follows directly from the symmetry - based observation that any cp - odd lorentz - scalar quantity which depends on only the properties of the nucleon must involve the nucleon spin  @xcite . on the other hand , we see that the pseudoscalar case also leads to a _ velocity suppression _ : the corresponding matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ limits ] ) is proportional to the velocity transfer @xmath63 , which is @xmath64 for most regions of interest involving dark - matter particles originating in the galactic halo .",
    "it is this velocity suppression which lies at the root of the relative disregard for pseudoscalar interactions in the dark - matter literature .",
    "given these observations , our next task is to determine the numerical values of the @xmath52 coefficients for the different cases of interest . in this paper , our interest in the scalar coupling structure",
    "will be restricted to the dark - matter bilinear rather than the quark bilinear  , in the language of eq .",

    "we also emphasize that we are not merely interested in the `` central values '' of these coefficients ; we are also interested in understanding their associated statistical and experimental _ uncertainties_. as we shall see , it is only by keeping track of these uncertainties that we can make solid statements about the phenomenological consequences of the different couplings in each case .    historically , the numerical values of the @xmath52 coefficients for the axial - vector case have been extracted through nucleon - structure scattering experiments  @xcite and through lattice gauge - theory calculations  @xcite . the results that we shall use in this paper",

    "were then added together in quadrature in order to produce the final uncertainties quoted in table  [ tab : deltaprime ] .",
    "as evident from table  [ tab : deltaprime ] , the results for the pseudoscalar @xmath72 coefficients no longer respect quark - level isospin invariance , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ quarklevelisospin ] ) . [ in this connection we observe that quark - level isospin invariance would also require @xmath82 . ]",
    "this is a clear distinction relative to the axial - vector case in table  [ tab : delta ] , but there are several ways in which to understand this result . at an algebraic level ,",
    "the breaking of quark - level isospin invariance arises because the transition from the axial - vector coefficients to the pseudoscalar coefficients explicitly involves the quark masses ; by contrast , the axial - vector coefficients were derived under approximations in which the light quarks are effectively treated as massless . or ,",
    "phrased somewhat differently , the leading terms in the axial - vector matrix elements are independent of the quark masses ; it is only the subleading terms which depend on these masses explicitly .",
    "this is different from the situation one faces in dealing with the pseudoscalar matrix elements , for which the leading terms are already mass dependent . on a more physical level , this difference can alternatively be understood as arising from the fact that the axial - vector current is somewhat special in that its matrix element essentially counts the number of fermions minus anti - fermions , weighted by chirality and normalized to the mass of the nucleon bound state .",
    "[ this is analogous to the vector - current matrix element , which also counts the normalized number of fermions minus anti - fermions but without a chirality weighting . ] as a result , the leading - order results in the axial - vector case depend on the number and charges of the parton constituents , but not their masses .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the pseudoscalar matrix elements , for which an additional quark mass dependence can arise .",
    "it should also be noted that while the uncertainties quoted in table  [ tab : deltaprime ] are reliable in terms of their approximate overall magnitudes , there are certain effects which we have not taken into account which might alter these results slightly .",
    "such effects will be discussed more fully as part of an exhaustive uncertainty analysis in ref .",
    "for example , we have treated the uncertainties in table  [ tab : delta ] for the axial - vector @xmath52 coefficients as independent of each other ( , uncorrelated ) , but in truth ( see , , ref .",
    "@xcite ) the @xmath69 and @xmath70 coefficients are actually extracted as linear combinations of two more fundamental variables @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "it is actually the uncertainties on these latter variables which are independent , not those on the @xmath52 coefficients .",
    "likewise , the uncertainties on the quark masses are also not independent , as these masses are typically extracted in terms of a single reference quark mass ( typically that of the down quark ) and the ratios of the other quark masses relative to this reference mass .",
    "the truly independent uncertainties are therefore those for the down - quark mass and the corresponding ratios",
    ". moreover , the uncertainties on the quark masses are not necessarily gaussian , since they typically have both systematic and random contributions . combining these into a single uncertainty , as we have done here , and then treating this single uncertainty as gaussian",
    "when performing a quadrature - based analysis represents yet another approximation .",
    "indeed , @xmath85 is an example of a variable whose uncertainty is completely systematic rather than experimental , yet its uncertainty is being treated as if were gaussian as well .",
    "finally , there is even some leeway concerning how one treats isospin symmetry in a rigorous uncertainty analysis .",
    "isospin symmetry , as mentioned above , is usually invoked in order to relate quantities such as @xmath86 and @xmath87  indeed , it is typically the case that these quantities are not measured independently . as a result of this presumed isospin symmetry ,",
    "these quantities are necessarily quoted as having the same central values and same quoted uncertainties , as indicated in table  [ tab : delta ] .",
    "however , it is not clear whether these uncertainties should be treated as independent or correlated when performing a quadrature - based uncertainty analysis of the sort we are performing here . while isospin symmetry would dictate that these uncertainties be treated as completely correlated , we know that isospin symmetry is only approximate in nature",
    "indeed , as mentioned above , the results in table  [ tab : deltaprime ] for the central values of our pseudoscalar @xmath72 coefficients already fail to respect isospin symmetry because of their explicit dependence on the light - quark masses .",
    "we have therefore opted to treat the uncertainties in table  [ tab : delta ] as completely independent and uncorrelated .    despite these observations , the uncertainties quoted in table  [ tab : deltaprime ] are correct in terms of their overall magnitudes .",
    "it is also evident that the pseudoscalar uncertainties quoted in table  [ tab : deltaprime ] are somewhat larger , in relative terms , than the corresponding axial - vector uncertainties quoted in table  [ tab : delta ] .",
    "this is partially due to the dependence of the pseudoscalar results on a constraint which stems from a large-@xmath88 approximation . as a result of these larger uncertainties",
    ", we see that certain quantities in table  [ tab : deltaprime ] , such as @xmath89 and @xmath90 , are actually consistent with zero .",
    "as we shall see , these results will lead to considerably larger uncertainties for our eventual pseudoscalar dark - matter / nucleon couplings .",
    "finally , we now turn to the pseudoscalar @xmath72 coefficients for the heavy quarks @xmath91 .",
    "as we shall see , these quantities will be relevant if our dark matter couples to such quarks . in the axial - vector case ,",
    "the analogous coefficients were taken to be zero , reflecting the fact that such quarks are heavy and make only negligible contributions to axial - vector couplings .",
    "for pseudoscalar couplings , by contrast , the situation is different . because of the current - algebra relation in eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) , we see that the pseudoscalar current is related to the _ derivative _ of a different current involving the same heavy fermions .",
    "however , if the fermions in question are sufficiently heavy , they will have no dynamics and this derivative must vanish .",
    "we thus obtain the relation 2 m_q n_f| i^5 q |n_i  =   - _ s4 n_f| gg| n_i  , from which we see that n_f| i^5 q |n_i&= & - 1m_q _ s8 n_f| gg| n_i + & = & -1m_q g^(n ) n_f| i^5 n |n_i  ,   where the values of @xmath92 are given algebraically in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaqprimeeqs ] ) .",
    "we thus find that q^(n )  =   - 1m_q g^(n )  .",
    "we now turn to the actual quantities @xmath55 which parametrize how the dark - matter fermion @xmath3 couples to nucleons @xmath41 in the case of pseudoscalar interactions . as evident in eq .",
    "( [ gchincouplings ] ) , these effective couplings @xmath55 are directly determined in terms of the @xmath72 coefficients for both light and heavy quarks : @xmath93 where the numerical values of the @xmath72 and @xmath92 coefficients are listed in table  [ tab : deltaprime ] .",
    "the only task remaining , then , is to determine the values for the quark couplings @xmath16 ( henceforth taken to collectively denote the couplings for both light and heavy quarks ) . of course , the expression in eq .",

    "this coupling structure is of particular interest from a direct - detection perspective , implying that @xmath111 and @xmath112 uniquely determine the effective dark - matter / nucleon couplings @xmath117 and @xmath118 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gchin ] ) , and _ vice versa_. moreover , with the couplings for the second- and third - generation quarks",
    "set to zero , this scenario is the only one which does not involve couplings which are essentially irrelevant for direct detection . since non - zero couplings for",
    "second- and third - generation quarks could potentially have a significant effect on the rates for dark - matter production at colliders  @xcite , this scenario is therefore in some sense the most `` conservative '' in that it does not assume any channels which might enhance collider signatures without affecting direct - detection signals .",
    "study of this scenario will therefore lead to the most conservative set of limits consistent with collider data .",
    "we emphasize that these three scenarios represent physically distinct coupling structures between @xmath3 and the sm quarks .",

    "i , the results in table  [ tab : deltaprime ] yield the effective pseudoscalar couplings @xmath119 likewise , given the uncertainties in table  [ tab : deltaprime ] , we find that the associated _ uncertainties _ in these couplings are given by rather complicated expressions which can be extremely well approximated as g_p & & |21.79 - 21.88| + g_n & & |21.32 - 21.33|  .

    "this is remarkable , representing a situation in which dark matter couples to quarks , but not to nucleons !",
    "moreover , this is to be compared with the couplings that emerge for other , isospin - violating values of @xmath97 .",
    "for example , we find that the proton coupling takes the value @xmath124 at @xmath125 , and reaches a maximum value @xmath126 at @xmath127 .",
    "the behavior of the neutron coupling @xmath128 is similar .",
    "thus , relative to the central values of these couplings at the isospin - preserving point @xmath129 , we see that these couplings experience a huge enhancement which can grow as large as a factor of @xmath130 !",

    "this is the direct result of the relatively large pseudoscalar coefficients @xmath72 in table  [ tab : deltaprime ] , operating within the framework of the particular quark coupling structure associated with scenario  i.   however , it is important to stress that there is nothing intrinsic to the coupling structure of scenario  i by itself which causes such large proton and nucleon couplings to emerge .",
    "for example , as an algebraic exercise , we can calculate the proton and neutron couplings that would emerge under scenario  i in the _ axial - vector _ case  , using the axial - vector coefficients @xmath52 in table  [ tab : delta ] rather than the pseudoscalar coefficients @xmath72 in table  [ tab : deltaprime ] . in this case , because of the fact that isospin symmetry is exactly preserved for the @xmath52 coefficients , both quark - level and nucleon - level isospin preservation coincide exactly at @xmath132 .",
    "indeed , at this point we find @xmath133 , while the maximum value taken by these couplings for any isospin - violating value of @xmath97 is @xmath134 at @xmath135 and @xmath136 at @xmath137 .",
    "thus , for the axial - vector case , we see that isospin violation is capable of increasing the proton and neutron couplings only by mere factors of @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively .",
    "we also note , of course , that the overall _ scale _ of the axial - vector couplings is significantly smaller than that for the pseudoscalar couplings .",
    "while it is perhaps inappropriate to compare the magnitudes of these different couplings against each other ( because they correspond to different operators with gamma - matrix bilinears exhibiting entirely different tensorial properties ) , at a purely algebraic level this difference can once again be attributed to the larger values of the @xmath72 coefficients that enter the calculation of the pseudoscalar proton and neutron couplings as compared with the values of the @xmath140 coefficients that enter the calculation of their axial - vector counterparts .",
    "2.15 truein   2.15 truein   2.15 truein     1.6 truein   1.6 truein   1.6 truein    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gchinplot ] , we have plotted the pseudoscalar proton and neutron couplings @xmath117 and @xmath118 , along with their corresponding uncertainties , as functions of @xmath97 for all three of our coupling scenarios . for comparison purposes , we have also plotted the corresponding axial - vector couplings as functions of the same variable @xmath97 . moreover , in each case we have normalized the proton and neutron couplings to the maximum value that the proton coupling ever attains as a function of @xmath97 .",
    "many features of these plots are worthy of note .",
    "focusing first on the pseudoscalar couplings , we have already remarked that a significant degree of cancellation occurs within scenario  i when isospin is conserved at the nucleon level : both the proton and neutron pseudoscalar couplings , along with their associated uncertainties , become extremely small as a result of a near - perfect cancellation between their individual up - quark and down - quark contributions . as remarked earlier , this is then a situation in which our dark matter couples to quarks , but not to nucleons ! what is now apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : gchinplot ] , however , is that this cancellation is a relatively sharp one , and that any movement away from this isospin - conserving value of @xmath97 in either direction results in a significant enhancement of these pseudoscalar nucleon couplings . as indicated above ,",
    "this results in an @xmath141 enhancement in the pseudoscalar couplings for isospin - violating scenarios relative to the nave isospin - conserving case , and thus to an @xmath142 enhancement in the cross - section for the scattering of @xmath3 off atomic nuclei .",
    "thus , we see that even a relatively small amount of isospin violation can have a dramatic effect on direct - detection rates !    the above behavior occurs for scenario  i.   however , we now see from fig .  [",
    "fig : gchinplot ] that similar behavior also occurs for scenario  iii , albeit at a somewhat shifted value of @xmath97 .",
    "this feature is also easy to understand . in scenario",
    "i , the cancellation that occurs at @xmath120 truly reflects an approximate isospin symmetry . indeed , while the term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gchingeneral ] ) proportional to @xmath92 is manifestly isospin - violating , this contribution is suppressed by several orders of magnitude compared to the contributions from the light quarks in this scenario . moreover , since the @xmath16 are independent of the quark masses in scenario  i and since the @xmath72 are _ approximately _ isospin - conserving ( particularly for the two lightest quarks ) , this cancellation occurs for a value of @xmath120 very close to @xmath143 .",
    "of course , in scenario  iii , the @xmath92 contribution to the couplings vanishes outright because the dark - matter particle does not couple to the heavy quarks .",
    "however , the above cancellation now occurs at the value @xmath144 rather than at @xmath145 , for within scenario  iii it is only at this shifted angle that @xmath146 .",
    "furthermore , within scenario  iii , we see that the uncertainties are no smaller at @xmath120 than they are at any other angle  another distinction relative to scenario  i.     finally , we observe that the pseudoscalar couplings shown for scenario  ii differ quite significantly from those shown for scenario  iii , both in terms of the locations of the nucleon - level isospin - preserving points as well as the overall magnitudes of the associated uncertainties .",
    "these differences ultimately reflect the contributions from the second- and third - generation quarks . one notable feature in scenario  ii , for example , is the fact that the sort of cancellation which occurs for scenarios  i and iii does not occur for scenario  ii .   the reason for this is also easy to understand . in scenario",
    "ii , we have @xmath147 for all quark species .",
    "for such a coupling structure , it turns out that the magnitudes of the two terms on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gchingeneral ] ) are roughly commensurate .",
    "thus , even if @xmath97 were set at a value for which the light - quark contributions roughly cancelled , the heavy - quark contributions would still be significant .",
    "indeed , for this scenario , we find that nucleon - level isospin preservation arises at @xmath148  a value much closer to @xmath149 than to @xmath150  but the proton and neutron couplings at this point are clearly non - zero .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gchinplot ] we have also illustrated what occurs for the corresponding _ axial - vector _ couplings in each scenario .",
    "for example , as already discussed above , we see that the isospin - preserving points no longer correspond to vanishing proton and neutron couplings  even for scenarios  i and iii .",
    "thus isospin violation will no longer produce as dramatic an enhancement for the axial - vector proton and neutron couplings as it does for the corresponding pseudoscalar couplings , even in these scenarios .",
    "moreover , we observe that unlike the situation for the pseudoscalar couplings , there are no values of @xmath97 in scenarios  i or iii for which both @xmath117 and @xmath118 vanish simultaneously .",
    "thus , for axial - vector couplings , dark - matter couplings to quarks always imply a dark - matter coupling to at least one nucleon .",
    "furthermore , we see that the uncertainties are so large for the axial - vector neutron coupling in scenario  ii that the value of this coupling is consistent with zero for almost all values of @xmath97 . finally , although it is not visible from the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : gchinplot ] , we again stress that the overall magnitude of the axial - vector couplings is a factor of @xmath151 smaller than the magnitude of the pseudoscalar couplings .",
    "this is perhaps the most important difference of all .    despite the rather compelling nature of these differences",
    ", it is important to bear in mind that the pseudoscalar and axial - vector couplings correspond to entirely different operators .",
    "thus , a direct comparison between these couplings is fraught with a number of theoretical subtleties .",
    "for example , scenarios  ii and iii are rather unnatural within an axial - vector framework , and it is difficult to imagine a high - scale model which might yield such an axial - vector effective operator with the quark - level couplings of scenarios  ii or iii at lower energies .",
    "this is completely different from what happens within the pseudoscalar framework , where the coupling structures of scenarios  ii and iii are particularly well motivated .",
    "nevertheless , we have undertaken such a direct coupling - to - coupling comparison in order to expose the primary numerical differences that emerge when the axial - vector @xmath52 coefficients of table  [ tab : delta ] are replaced with the pseudoscalar @xmath72 coefficients of table  [ tab : deltaprime ] .",
    "indeed , from a purely bottom - up perspective , the coupling structures of all three scenarios can be taken to represent interesting benchmarks which are introduced purely for the purpose of studying varying resulting phenomenologies in a model - independent framework .",
    "we have therefore chosen to study the resulting couplings free of any theoretical prejudice stemming from considerations of high - scale physics .",
    "of course , what ultimately matters in each case are not the couplings themselves , but rather the implications of these couplings for the reach of actual direct - detection experiments .",
    "for example , we have seen that even a small amount of isospin violation can dramatically enhance our pseudoscalar couplings , but it remains to be seen whether this effect is large enough to compensate for the velocity suppression which is also associated with pseudoscalar interactions , and thereby render such interactions potentially relevant for detection at the next generation of spin - dependent dark - matter direct - detection experiments .",
    "this is therefore the topic to which we now turn .",
    "in this paper , our analysis has focused on those interactions between dark matter and standard - model matter which take the form of effective four - fermi contact interactions whose operators exhibit the double - bilinear form in eq .",
    "( [ operator ] ) . thus far",
    ", our interest has focused on the unique physics that emerges from assuming a pseudoscalar structure for the quark bilinear in eq .",
    "( [ operator ] ) , and indeed all of our results thus far have relied on this choice .",
    "however , we have yet to select a tensor structure for the corresponding dark - matter bilinear , and lorentz invariance dictates that there are only two possible choices open to us : _",
    "q^(sp ) & & c_q^2 ( ) ( i^5 q ) + o_q^(pp ) & & c_q^2 ( i^5 ) ( i^5 q )  . [ lagchoices ] the first of these operators breaks cp symmetry , while the second preserves it .",
    "unfortunately , we can proceed no further in our discussion of actual direct - detection experimental prospects without making a specific choice between these two operators .    the cp - violating operator @xmath152 is often neglected in direct - detection studies , even in comparison with @xmath153 .",
    "one reason for this is that @xmath153 is cp - invariant and can therefore be generated at a non - trivial level in many top - down theoretical constructions which yield a stable dark - matter candidate , such as the constrained minimal supersymmetric model ( cmssm ) in which there is no additional source of cp violation .",
    "however , in a bottom - up effective - theory approach such as the one we adopt here , the aim is to examine and constrain the properties of all possible interactions which could arise between the dark - matter candidate and the particles of the sm in as model - independent a framework as possible , without theoretical prejudice . indeed , while the operator @xmath153 is typically assumed to be irrelevant for direct detection , it is instructive to revisit why this is the case  and also why this is _ not _ the case for @xmath152 , despite the fact that the structure of the quark bilinear is the same in both cases .",
    "let us first consider the situation in which @xmath3 couples to sm particles primarily via @xmath153 .",
    "we assume for the purposes of this discussion that this operator provides the dominant contribution both to the cross - section for nuclear scattering events at direct - detection experiments and to the annihilation rate of @xmath3 and @xmath154 in the early universe . for purposes of illustration",

    "moreover , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : annihilation ] , the abundance - related orange and black curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] do not represent true relic - density limits if @xmath290 .",
    "similarly , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ dirdet ] , our monojet and mono-@xmath259 collider curves only represent exclusion bounds under the assumption that the contact - operator description of our scalar / pseudoscalar interaction remains valid up to the tev scale .",
    "when this is not the case , the bounds can be far weaker or even effectively disappear .    as we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] , the dark - matter abundance does not depend significantly on the value of @xmath97 in scenarios  i or iii .",
    "by contrast , in scenario  ii , our results depend sensitively on @xmath97 due to the enhanced couplings to third - generation quarks relative to those of the first and second generations . indeed , in scenario",
    "ii the abundance contours have sharp kinks or discontinuities that are not apparent in scenarios  i or iii .",
    "this behavior ultimately arises because the couplings to the sm quarks in scenario  ii are proportional to their masses , leading to a dramatic enhancement in the annihilation rate when the thresholds for new annihilation channels into heavy quark species are crossed .",
    "however , this assumes that the dark - matter coupling to these heavy - quark species is substantial  a feature that is ultimately @xmath97-dependent .",
    "overall , examining the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] , we see that there are three main conclusions which may be drawn .",
    "the first and most significant result demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] is that there are regions of parameter space for which a thermal abundance matching @xmath291 is not only consistent with current experimental limits on the pseudoscalar operator , but can actually be probed by the next generation of direct - detection experiments .",
    "this does not occur in merely one or two fine - tuned cases , but rather as a fairly generic result for all three scenarios defined in sect .",
    "[ sec : nucleoncouplings ] and for most values of @xmath97 .",
    "second , we observe that in some cases , the opposite is true : the reach of our direct - detection experiments is significantly less than might be expected based on the magnitudes of the @xmath292 coefficients .",
    "this is particularly true for the @xmath102 case of scenario  i , or the @xmath293 case of scenario  ii .   indeed , in such cases , we see that the direct - detection experiments can not even probe that portion of the parameter space that would be associated with a thermal relic . moreover , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : abundances ] that the uncertainties in these cases are sufficiently broad that the direct - detection experiments may not even have any significant reach at all !",
    "ultimately , these effects can easily be understood in relation to fig .",
    "[ fig : gchinplot ] , where we have seen that for both of these cases the effective dark - matter / nucleon couplings themselves come extremely close to vanishing .",
    "( a similar thing would also have happened for @xmath294 in scenario  iii , if such a @xmath97-value were being plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] . ) as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : nucleoncouplings ] , these are situations in which the dark matter couples significantly to quarks , but not to nucleons . in such cases , we conclude that the non - observation of a dark - matter signal in coupp-4 and in future direct - detection experiments need not rule out the existence of dark matter which nevertheless still couples to quarks and which could therefore potentially produce a signal at collider experiments .",
    "finally , conversely , we see that the effects of isospin violation ( , variations in the value of @xmath97 ) can have dramatic effects , potentially enhancing the reach of direct - detection experiments quite significantly compared with the reach of these experiments when nucleon - level isospin symmetry is preserved .",
    "for example , in scenario  i , we note that the reach of pico-250l is approximately 20 times greater ( in terms of the values of @xmath96 being probed ) for @xmath293 than for @xmath102 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the sensitivity of direct - detection experiments to dark matter which couples to quarks through dimension - six effective operators of the form @xmath295 , utilizing ( for illustrative purposes ) several distinct benchmark choices for the quark couplings @xmath16 . as we discussed , such effective operators give rise to velocity - suppressed spin - dependent dark - matter / nucleon scattering .",
    "such operators can also give rise to @xmath296 annihilation from a @xmath44-wave initial state , as well as ",
    "mono - anything \" signals at the lhc .",
    "although it might navely be supposed that velocity - dependent spin - dependent scattering would produce an unobservably small event rate at direct - detection experiments , we have demonstrated that this in fact need not be the case .",
    "indeed , as we have seen , the velocity - suppression factors that arise in the pseudoscalar matrix element can be compensated by extra enhancement factors which also emerge in the pseudoscalar case when relating the corresponding pseudoscalar quark currents to effective pseudoscalar nucleon currents .",
    "these latter enhancement factors are of size @xmath73 relative to similar factors associated with velocity-_independent _ spin - dependent scattering ( such as arises through axial - vector interactions ) . as a result ,",
    "contrary to popular lore , we see that velocity - suppressed scattering may actually be within reach of current and upcoming direct - detection experiments .",
    "this then necessitates a sensitivity study of the sort that we have performed .",
    "* we have shown that there exists a substantial region of @xmath297 parameter space in which the couplings of the @xmath152 operators are consistent with a thermal relic density which matches observation .",
    "of course , given the model - independent nature of our approach , we have not addressed the question of how these operators might ultimately be embedded in a uv - complete model .",
    "nevertheless , such models can easily be constructed  for example , the coupling structure of scenario  ii can be realized within the context of cp - violating two - higgs - doublet models  @xcite . *",
    "a subset of the above parameter space is excluded by current bounds from coupp-4 , and it is expected that an even larger region of this viable parameter space will be probed by coupp-60 and pico-250l . * while part of the parameter space may be constrained by lhc bounds if the contact - operator approximation remains valid at the tev scale , there are a wide range of models for which spin - dependent scattering is actually the discovery channel . as we have seen , this is true because the velocity - suppression effects normally associated with pseudoscalar couplings can be overcome through nucleonic effects that emerge in relating quark pseudoscalar currents to nucleon pseudoscalar currents . *",
    "conversely , there are special situations ( often associated with isospin - preserving limits ) in which these same nucleonic effects render direct - detection experiments utterly insensitive to non - zero couplings between dark matter and sm quarks . in other words , we have seen that dark matter can have a significant , non - vanishing coupling to quarks and yet simultaneously have no coupling to nucleons ! this opens up the intriguing possibility that collider experiments and other indirect - detection experiments could potentially see dark - matter signals to which direct - detection experiments would be utterly blind .",
    "this may be extremely relevant in case of future apparent conflicts between positive signals from collider experiments and negative results from direct - detection experiments . *",
    "finally , we see that isospin-_violation _ generally tends to _ enhance _ dark - matter signals in direct - detection experiments relative to the signals which would have been expected if the quark / nucleon couplings were isospin - preserving .",
    "moreover , for pseudoscalar couplings , this enhancement is not just a factor of two or three ( as would be the case for axial - vector interactions ) , but a factor of ten or more .",
    "this then opens up the possibility that direct - detection experiments can be sensitive to such pseudoscalar couplings .",
    "a few comments are in order , especially in relation to the last two points above . in scenario",
    "i , dark - matter / nucleon couplings are maximally isospin - violating when @xmath298 or @xmath125 .",
    "interestingly , these cases provide the greatest sensitivity for direct - detection experiments ( such as pico-250l ) which are sensitive to spin - dependent scattering . by contrast , detectors which are only sensitive to spin - independent scattering would have no chance of discovering such events , even if velocity - dependent effects are included .",
    "this is because , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : nucleoncouplings ] , all terms originating from @xmath152 which contribute to the scattering cross - section  and not just those at leading order  are spin - dependent .    on the other hand , we have seen that the sensitivity of direct - detection experiments is especially poor in the isospin - conserving cases ( such as @xmath143 in our scenario  i ) for which the couplings to up- and down - quarks are similar .",
    "this poor sensitivity is ultimately the result of a destructive interference amongst these quark - level couplings , resulting in a small net coupling to both protons and neutrons .",
    "indeed , in the limit within scenario  i for which @xmath299 and @xmath300 , we find @xmath301 identically at @xmath263 .",
    "note that result is detector - independent : one obtains a large suppression in the event rate _",
    "regardless _ of whether the detector is sensitive to spin - dependent scattering from protons or neutrons . moreover",
    ", since the dark - matter bilinear is a scalar , dark - matter annihilation is @xmath44-wave - suppressed .",
    "thus , although the annihilation rate at the time of freeze - out may have been large enough to ensure the correct relic density , the annihilation cross - section at the current epoch would be so small as to be unobservable .",
    "dark - matter models of this sort would be difficult to probe via any direct- or indirect - detection experiments .    in this paper , we considered three different scenarios for the couplings @xmath16 between the dark matter and sm quarks .",
    "these correspond to different weightings for the various contributions from the light quarks to the resulting dark - matter / nucleon couplings and their associated dark - matter scattering rates . in scenario",
    "i , for example , the dominant contributions came from the couplings of the quarks of the first generation , but we found that there also exist small contributions from the strange quark and heavier quarks . likewise , in scenario  i we found that @xmath301 for @xmath263 . in scenario",
    "iii , by contrast , the additional contributions from the strange and heavier quarks are absent .",
    "moreover , since the @xmath16 coefficients of scenario  iii scale with the masses of the quarks , we instead find that @xmath301 for @xmath302 . in this connection , it is perhaps worth emphasizing that it is only for the pseudoscalar interactions that there exist values of @xmath97 for which both @xmath117 and @xmath118 vanish simultaneously . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gchinplot ] , this does not happen for any of the analogous couplings in the axial - vector case .",
    "finally , scenario  ii is an example of a class of models in which the largest dark - matter coupling is to the strange quark or the heavy quarks .",
    "as discussed earlier , this particular example is motivated by minimal flavor - violation . as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] , the sensitivity of direct - detection experiments to viable dark - matter models is suppressed for such cases .",
    "it is clear why this occurs . in scenario",
    "ii , the largest dark - matter couplings are those to the second- and third - generation quarks  indeed , these are ultimately bounded by constraints on the relic density .",
    "unfortunately , the contributions from these second- and third - generation quark couplings to dark - matter scattering are relatively small as a result of a suppression of the corresponding nucleon enhancement factors , while the coupling to first - generation quarks is necessarily small by assumption in this scenario .    depending on the details of the short - distance ( ultraviolet ) physics model",
    "we imagine , dark matter which couples to quarks through an effective operator such as @xmath152 may also be amenable to  mono - anything \" searches at the lhc",
    ".   in particular , for isospin - conserving variants in which the first - generation quarks dominate the scattering , lhc searches may be the only viable options for discovery .",
    "moreover , lhc sensitivity may be enhanced for flavor structures such as those in scenario  ii which are motivated by minimal flavor - violation , due to the large contribution to the lhc event rate that arises from the couplings to the heavy quarks .",
    "ultimately , however , lhc sensitivity depends on the details of the model , and in particular on the flavor structure of the couplings . for the wide class of models in which such large lhc event rates do not occur , spin - dependent direct - detection will then be the discovery search channel .",

    "<S> pseudoscalar couplings between standard - model quarks and dark matter are normally not considered relevant for dark - matter direct - detection experiments because they lead to velocity - suppressed scattering cross - sections in the non - relativistic limit . however , at the nucleon level , such couplings are effectively enhanced by factors of order @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are appropriate nucleon and quark masses respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement can thus be sufficient to overcome the corresponding velocity suppression , implying  contrary to common lore  that direct - detection experiments can indeed be sensitive to pseudoscalar couplings . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we explain how this enhancement arises , and present a model - independent analysis of pseudoscalar interactions at direct - detection experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify those portions of the corresponding dark - matter parameter space which can be probed at current and future experiments of this type , and discuss the role of isospin violation in enhancing the corresponding experimental reach .    .7ex    </S>",
