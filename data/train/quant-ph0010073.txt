    "the study of singular potentials in quantum mechanics is almost as old as quantum mechanics itself  @xcite .",
    "physically , singular potentials pose problems because the force between two particles , represented by the potential , does not uniquely determine the scattering problem  @xcite . here",
    "we will focus on singular potentials of @xmath0 type , with @xmath1 .",
    "classically , particles subject to such a force fall to the origin with an infinite velocity . in the quantum theory ,",
    "the wavefunction oscillates indefinitely on the way to the origin , allowing no way of specifying a linear combination of solutions  @xcite . of course ,",
    "in any physical situation described by a singular potential , the potential is intended as a description of long - range behavior , so there is a sense in which the pathologies which occur near the origin are irrelevant to the physical problem .",
    "this should remind the reader of the infinities encountered in quantum field theory which are cured through renormalization .",
    "this analogy with field theory has provided an important motivation for the study of singular potentials  @xcite .",
    "if a singular potential itself is not sufficient to determine the scattering problem , one might be tempted to classify the singular potentials as nonrenormalizable and abandon all hope .",
    "this point of view is now outdated . in the modern version of the renormalization paradigm a low - energy system with a clear - cut separation of scales can be described by an effective field theory ( eft ) involving explicitly only the long - wavelength degrees of freedom , and organized as an expansion in powers of momenta  @xcite .",
    "the short - range dynamics can always be treated as a set of local operators . in the present context",
    ", the @xmath0 potential represents the long - distance part of the potential .",
    "local operators in momentum space correspond to delta - function interactions in coordinate space .",
    "the essential point of eft is that the details of the short - distance physics are not of importance to low - energy scattering .",
    "hence one can simulate the delta function in an infinite number of ways .",
    "the simplest choice of a `` smeared out ''",
    "delta function is a simple square well . with",
    "a singular potential representing a given long - distance force , and a square well representing unknown short - distance physics , an interesting question is whether one can obtain an eft with well defined low - energy scattering observables , which are to a specified degree of accuracy insensitive to the short - distance physics encoded by the square well .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to explore this issue .",
    "note that we do not attempt to renormalize the coupling strength of the singular potential itself  @xcite . in the physical problems of interest ,",
    "the coupling strength is completely determined by the long - distance physics so there is no freedom to renormalize this parameter .",
    "by way of physical motivation we note that the singular potentials of @xmath0 type are of great current physical interest .",
    "the special case @xmath5 is relevant to the three - body problem in nuclear physics  @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this case is also relevant to point - dipole interactions in molecular physics  @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath6 corresponds to the tensor force between nucleons and is at the heart of nuclear physics .",
    "the issue of the proper renormalization of this potential is an essential ingredient of the intense ongoing effort to develop a perturbative theory of nuclear interactions  @xcite .",

    "the case @xmath8 is a perturbative correction to the tensor force in the nuclear potential  @xcite .",

    "we set up the quantum mechanical scattering problem of two particles subject to a @xmath0 potential with a square well . in section 3",
    "we consider the marginal @xmath5 case in some detail .",
    "the pure singular potentials @xmath11 are considered at zero energy in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we make use of the wkb approximation to generalize our results to non - zero energy and to estimate the errors associated with the renormalization procedure .",
    "we discuss the applicability of a perturbative expansion for singular potentials in section 6 .",
    "our numerical analysis , for the case @xmath7 , is discussed in section 7 .",
    "we discuss and conclude in section 8 .",
    "we consider two particles of reduced mass @xmath13 interacting in the @xmath14 wave with a singular potential that goes as @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "this potential has a scale that sets its curvature , @xmath15 ; this is the characteristic scale of the long - distance physics .",
    "the strength of the long - distance potential is governed by a parameter @xmath16 . to obtain well - defined solutions , we need to regulate the potential by introducing a cutoff procedure .",
    "since we are posing the problem in coordinate space , we do this through a cutoff radius @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "we expect that the solutions will depend sensitively on @xmath19 , that is , on the short - range physics .",
    "we simulate a short - range delta - function interaction by a square well of this radius and with depth @xmath20 .",
    "the problem will be correctly renormalized once we are able to vary @xmath19 ( inasmuch as @xmath21 ) and simultaneously @xmath22 in such a way as to keep observables ( say phase shifts ) invariant .",
    "the corresponding constraint @xmath23 represents the renormalization - group flow of the contact interaction   which leaves observables invariant . ] .",
    "we will see that this short - distance physics is represented by the running coupling    @xmath24    we thus take as our potential    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is a regular function of @xmath27 near the origin with @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",

    "therefore in a system described by an attractive singular potential alone , the hamiltonian of the system is given by the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy , @xmath37 .",
    "note that for a coulomb potential , @xmath38 , and for a sufficiently weak @xmath5 potential , the hamiltonian is bounded and therefore the schrdinger equation has a unique regular solution .",

    "furthermore , when @xmath11 the hamiltonian is always unbounded from below .",
    "hence , an attractive singular potential alone is meaningless in the vicinity of the origin ; the unboundedness of the hamiltonian represents the onset of short - distance physics whose effect must be included in the potential .",

    "the schrdinger equation for @xmath42 is    @xmath43    and the general solution is    @xmath44    where @xmath45 . for @xmath46",

    "this is the fundamental problem with singular potentials in quantum mechanics .",
    "renormalization theory tells us that this sickness is to be expected and arises from probing arbitrarily short - distance scales , where the true potential no longer has the form @xmath54 .",
    "the cure is to cut off the long - distance potential at a radius @xmath19 and introduce a simple parametrization of the unknown short - distance physics , since low - energy observables can not distinguish between the schematic , parametrized potential and the true potential at short distances .",
    "we choose a square well for simplicity , but we emphasize that any choice of function is equally valid .",
    "the solution in the interior region , @xmath55 , is straightforward .",

    "this would negate a perturbative description at weak coupling , a conclusion which must be incorrect .",
    "one might imagine some as yet experimentally invisible light particle which interacts at long distances via a singular potential ( e.g. an axion ) .",
    "if the behavior of the wavefunction were such that there is a branch point at the origin of the coupling - constant plane , then nonperturbative effects would persist even for couplings of gravitational strength .",
    "we have seen that this nonanalyticity is an artifact which is removed by short - distance physics encoded by the square well .",
    "renormalization renders low - energy phase shifts cutoff independent up to @xmath181 corrections .",
    "the cutoff dependence of these errors is not generally a power law as one expects in wilsonian eft .",
    "the renormalization - group flow introduces complicated oscillatory behavior in the corrections , which nonetheless is small for judiciously chosen cutoffs .",
    "our theoretical expectations of the error have been confirmed numerically .",
    "we expect that the methods developed in this paper will prove useful to those interested in the cornucopia of physical systems whose long - distance behavior is governed by singular potentials .",
