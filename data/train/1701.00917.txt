    "recent observations of the transmission spectra of exoplanets revealed that some hot jupiters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , hot neptunes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and super - earth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have featureless spectra .",
    "one interpretation of the featureless spectra is that these exoplanets have dust clouds that block starlight at high altitudes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dust clouds are also believed to have the crucial impacts on the observed spectra of brown dwarfs whose effective temperature fall into the same range of exoplanets . for example , the observations of brown dwarfs show a blueward shift of spectral energy distributions during l / t transition that might suggest the sinking of condensate particles .",
    "observations also suggest spectral variability that might imply the effect of cloud spatial distributions @xcite .    a realistic cloud model that predicts the size and spatial distributions of condensation particles for arbitrary atmospheric conditions is necessary to understand the atmospheric properties of both exoplanets and brown dwarfs .",
    "the microphysics that governs the formation of clouds is highly complex , and there are at least two processes by which cloud particles can grow .",
    "the first process is the condensation of vapor onto particles in an adiabatically cooling updraft . in terrestrial water clouds and jovian ice clouds ,",
    "this process is responsible for the growth of small particles to 10 @xmath0 in radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "further growth of the particles proceeds through the second process , the coalescence driven by the differential settling under gravity .",
    "this second process is essential for the initiation of precipitation in terrestrial water clouds @xcite .",
    "however , previous models of clouds in exoplanets as well as in brown dwarfs neglected or at least parametrized coalescence .",
    "the convective cloud model by @xcite , which has been used by @xcite for modeling the transmission spectrum of super - earth gj 1214b , encapsulates the effects of particle growth due to condensation and coalescence in a single free parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this parameter is given by the ratio of the particle terminal velocity to the atmospheric convective velocity , and depends on the particle size through the terminal velocity .",
    "it is commonly assumed that @xmath1 is constant throughout a cloud @xcite , but there is no guarantee that it must be for arbitrary convective clouds .",
    "the recent cloud model for earth - like exoplanets by @xcite treats the microphysics of condensation , but greatly simplifies the coalescence processes by introducing the efficiency of precipitation as a free parameter . the dust cloud model developed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which has recently been applied to clouds in hot jupiters hd 209458b and hd 189733b @xcite , takes into account condensation and evaporation but not coalescence .",
    "@xcite neglected coalescence because , according to @xcite , coalescence takes place much slower than condensation in brown dwarfs .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , coalescence becomes the only particle growth mechanism even in brown dwarfs if the supersaturation @xmath2 , defined by the fractional excess of the partial pressure from saturation , is significantly low , e.g. , @xmath3 .",
    "while @xcite fixed the supersaturation to @xmath4 , the actual supersaturation in an updraft depends on the number density of initial condensation nuclei , which is highly uncertain for exoplanets as well as for brown dwarfs .    in this paper , we present a simple one - dimensional cloud model that is simple but takes into account the microphysics of coalescence as well as of condensation .",
    "we describe the basic equations and cloud microphysics in our model in section 2 .",
    "we test our model by comparing with the observations of the clouds on the earth and jupiter in section 3 .",
    "we discuss the threshold velocity of sticking and the outlook on application to exoplanetary clouds in section 4 .",
    "we present a summary in section 5 .",

    "the model includes particle growth due to condensation , coalescence , and sweepout ( for the definitions of these processes , see section  [ sec : outline ] ) , and also vertical transport due to gravitational settling and the updraft motion of the gas . ]",
    "our model provides the vertical distributions of the mass and number densities of condensate particles ( figure  [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "we adopt a one - dimensional eulerian framework in which the gas ascends at a vertical velocity @xmath5 .",
    "each condensate particle is assumed to fall relative the the upwelling gas at a terminal speed @xmath6 , which is given by the balance between gas drag and gravity and is therefore a function of the particle radius @xmath7 ( see equation  ( [ eq : vt_fit ] ) for the expression of @xmath6 adopted in this study ) .",
    "thus , each particle has a net vertical velocity @xmath8 .",
    "we divide the population of condensate particles into small `` cloud particles '' whose net vertical motion is upward , @xmath9 , and large `` rain particles '' whose net vertical motion is downward , @xmath10 . in this paper , we assume that initial cloud particles form through heterogeneous nucleation ( see section  [ sec : nuc ] for details ) .",
    "we denote the total number density and mass density of the cloud ( rain ) particles by @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , respectively .",
    "we assume that the cloud and rain particles have characteristic radii @xmath15 and @xmath16 and characteristic masses @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , where @xmath19 is the internal density of the particles . for liquid particles",
    ", @xmath19 is equal to the material density of the condensate , @xmath20 , while for solid particles , @xmath19 can be lower than @xmath20 because an aggregate of solid particles can be porous",
    ". the porosity of condensate particles can potentially affect the growth and motion of the particles as demonstrated by theoretical studies on dust evolution in protoplanetary disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we here neglect this effect by assuming constant bulk density , @xmath21 , but we plan to take it into account in future work .",
    "our model determines the vertical distribution of @xmath11 , @xmath13 , @xmath12 , @xmath14 , and the condensate vapor mass density @xmath22 by numerically solving the set of vertically one - dimensional transport equations with terms representing condensation and coalescence ( sections  [ sec : transport ] and [ sec : cond][sec : sweep ] ) .",
    "condensation refers to particle growth through the accretion of supersaturated vapor , while coalescence refers to the growth through collisions with other condensate particles under gravity . in this study",
    ", we refer to the coalescence between cloud and rain particles as sweepout , in order to distinguish the coalescence of two cloud particles or of two rain particles .",
    "we neglect the condensation of vapor onto rain particles because the timescale of condensation growth is longer than the timescale of sedimentation for these large particles .",
    "the characteristic masses and radii of two particle species ( cloud and rain ) are automatically determined by the mass and number densities via the relations @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , where @xmath25 c for cloud particles and @xmath26 r for rain particles .",
    "such a framework is called a double - moment bulk scheme in meteorology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a characteristic size method in the planet formation community ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this characteristic size method allows us to simulate the growth of particles with much less computational time than that required with spectral bin schemes where the full size distribution of particles is evolved @xcite .",
    "our method is particularly useful for studying cloud formation over a wide parameter space .    because the terminal velocity of particles generally increases as they grow",
    ", there is a height @xmath27 at which the net upward velocity of cloud particles reaches zero , i.e. , @xmath28_{z = z_{\\rm top } } = 0 $ ] . at this height , which we call the cloud top , we convert the cloud particles into rain particles and allow them to fall and continue growing ( see figure  [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "our implementation of the cloud - to - rain conversion is described in section  [ sec : conv ] .",
    "the transport equations used in our model are given by @xmath29 - \\left| \\frac{\\partial n_{\\rm c}}{\\partial t } \\right|_{\\rm coal } -\\left| \\frac{\\partial n_{\\rm c}}{\\partial t } \\right|_{\\rm sweep } , \\label{eq : dncdt}\\ ] ] @xmath30 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho_{\\rm c}}{\\partial t } \\right)_{\\rm cond } -m_{\\rm c}\\left| \\frac{\\partial n_{\\rm c}}{\\partial t } \\right|_{\\rm sweep } , \\label{eq : drhocdt } \\label{basic1}\\ ] ] @xmath31   - \\left| \\frac{\\partial n_{\\rm r}}{\\partial t } \\right|_{\\rm coal } , \\label{eq : dnrdt}\\ ] ] @xmath32   + m_{\\rm c}\\left| \\frac{\\partial n_{\\rm c}}{\\partial t } \\right|_{\\rm sweep } , \\label{eq : drhordt}\\ ] ] @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the rate of increase in @xmath35 due to condensation , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the rate of decrease in @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) due to the coalescence of cloud ( rain ) particles themselves , and @xmath38 is the rate of decrease in @xmath11 due to sweepout .",
    "the expressions for @xmath34 , @xmath39 , and @xmath38 are given in sections  [ sec : cond][sec : sweep ] .",
    "we assume that cloud particles form at the cloud base through the condensation of vapor onto small refractory grains that already exist in the atmosphere .",
    "this process is known as heterogeneous nucleation , and such refractory grains are termed cloud condensation nuclei ( ccn )",
    ". on earth ccn include sea salt , ash , and dust from the land ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "lacking information about ccn in other planets including exoplanets , we parametrize them with their number density @xmath40 and radius @xmath41 . the ccn number density is a particularly important parameter because it determines the number density and maximum reachable size of cloud particles growing through condensation .    in principle , cloud particles may also form through homogeneous nucleation , where molecules in supersaturated vapor spontaneously collide to form initial nuclei .",
    "although homogeneous nucleation is the simplest nucleation process , this occurs only at a supersaturation ratio much larger than unity because of the free energy barrier arising from the surface tension ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by contrast , heterogeneous nucleation generally occurs when the supersaturation ratio is slightly above unity because the ccns lower the free energy barrier @xcite .",
    "however , if there are only a few ccns available in the atmosphere , homogeneous nucleation would dominate over heterogeneous nucleation @xcite . for simplicity , we ignore homogeneous nucleation in the present study , but we plan to include this effect in our future modeling .",
    "the cloud base is defined by the location above which the saturation vapor pressure @xmath42 of condensing gas under consideration exceeds the partial pressure in the gas phase .",
    "this location is mainly determined by the vertical temperature profile of the atmosphere , and weakly depends on the mixing ratio of the condensing gas under the cloud base .",
    "if the cloud particle size @xmath15 is much larger than the mean free path of condensing vapor molecules , the rate of increase in @xmath13 due to condensation is given by @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the specific latent heat of vaporization , @xmath11 is the number density of the cloud particles , @xmath45 is the coefficient of thermal conductivity of the atmosphere , and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the diffusion coefficient , specific gas constant , and saturation vapor density of the vapor , respectively .",
    "the saturation vapor density is related to the saturation vapor pressure @xmath42 by @xmath49 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : cond ] ) neglects the effects of surface tension and nonvolatile solutes on the saturation vapor pressure over the particles surfaces .",
    "this is a good approximation for activated condensate particles @xcite .",
    "the assumption that the particle sizes are larger than the atmospheric mean free path is justified for the clouds on the earth and jupiter we considered in section  [ sec : tests ] . the atmospheric mean free path in the terrestrial water clouds ( where @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) and in jovian ammonia clouds ( where @xmath52  k and @xmath53 ) is @xmath54 , which is significantly smaller than the typical particle radius in the clouds ( see figures [ fig : rico ] and [ fig : jupiter ] in section  [ sec : tests ] ) , however , this assumption is not necessarily valid for clouds in exoplanets .",
    "for example , zns and kcl clouds on super - earth gj1214b could form at @xmath55 @xcite , where the mean free path is @xmath56 . furthermore",
    ", the observation of gj1214b suggests the presence of high - altitude clouds at @xmath57 @xcite , where the mean free path is as long as @xmath58 .",

    ", we adopt @xmath70 for arbitrary values of @xmath71 .",
    "the collection efficiency @xmath64 accounts for the effect of the gas flow around a large particle moving relative to the background gas : the gas flow sweeps aside particles that are aerodynamically well coupled to the gas ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , their chapter 14 ) . for a collision between two particles of radii @xmath7 and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , the collection efficiency can be expressed in terms of the stokes number @xmath74 which is approximately the ratio between the stopping time @xmath75 and crossing time @xmath76 of the smaller particle . when @xmath77 , the smaller particle is strongly coupled to the flow around the large particle .",
    "to zeroth order , @xmath64 behaves as @xmath78 at @xmath77 and as @xmath79 at @xmath80 @xcite . in this study , we evaluate @xmath64 using a smoother analytic function ( * ? ? ?",

    ", coalescence occurs only after the particle size exceeds a threshold above which @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the production of precipitating rain droplets through coalescence requires growth beyond this threshold by condensation @xcite .",

    ", one may assume @xmath87 .",
    "the free - molecular flow regime is expected to govern the collisional growth of particles at high altitudes where the gas density is low .",

    "we evaluate the effective radius in our simulated clouds as @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the optical thickness above height @xmath106 .",
    "the factor @xmath181 accounts for the fact that one can only observe particles residing at @xmath182 . in the calculation of @xmath147 and @xmath180",
    ", we apply the geometric optics approximation to the extinction cross section at visible wavelengths .",
    "the geometric thickness of the simulated cloud is taken to be the distance between the cloud base and cloud top in this study .",
    "on the results for jovian ammonia ice clouds .",
    "the value of @xmath40 is fixed to @xmath183 .",
    "the dotted red lines show the simulations for @xmath140 , the solid blue lines show for @xmath184 , and the dashed dark - green lines show for @xmath185 , respectively . ]",
    "the results are summarized in figure  [ fig : jupiter ] . here",
    ", the solid lines show the values of @xmath178 , @xmath145 , and @xmath147 from our condensation  coalescence model for different sets of the updraft velocity @xmath5 and ccn density @xmath40 .",
    "the orange horizontal bars indicate the retrievals by @xcite : @xmath186@xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189@xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the pressure scale height and the range for @xmath178 is based on the interpretation by @xcite .",
    "we find that the predictions from the condensation  coalescence model satisfies all these observational constraints when the updraft velocity @xmath5 and ccn number density @xmath40 are assumed to be @xmath192@xmath153 and @xmath193 ( see the solid black lines ) , respectively .",
    "if @xmath194 ( see the dashed lines ) , the predicted optical depth falls within the retrieved range only when @xmath195@xmath196 ; however , for this range of @xmath5 , the predicted effective radius is too small to be consistent with the retrieval .",
    "if @xmath197 ( see the dotted lines ) , our prediction reproduces the retrieved optical depth only when @xmath198@xmath199 , but then overestimates the effective radius from the retrieval .",
    "the results presented in figure  [ fig : jupiter ] are little affected by the choice of the @xmath96 parameter introduced in our cloud - top treatment , as shown in figure  [ fig : beta_jup ] .",
    "one can see that the predictions converge for @xmath101 . for @xmath104 , the predicted effective radius and optical depth at @xmath200 are higher than the converged values , but the deviation from the converged value is as small as a factor of less than 2 .",
    "we compare the updraft velocity of @xmath152@xmath201 with other calculations to validate our best fit value .",
    "first , the mixing length theory formulated by @xcite suggested the updraft velocity at ammonia cloud region is approximately @xmath202@xmath153 , which corresponds to the eddy diffusion coefficient @xmath203@xmath204 and the mixing length equal to @xmath191 .",
    "furthermore , the 2d simulations of the jovian moist convection show that the updraft velocity at ammonia cloud region is @xmath205@xmath201 @xcite shown in the vertical orange bar of figure [ fig : jupiter ] .",
    "therefore , our best fit value of updraft velocity of @xmath152 ",
    "@xmath201 is a realistic value for the jovian ammonia cloud region .",
    "unfortunately , there is no direct observational constraint on the ccn number density for jovian ammonia clouds .",
    "however , an important hint for the ccn density can be obtained from the in - situ observation of the jovian atmosphere in a relatively particle - free hot spot by the galileo probe .",
    "the observation showed that a concentration of small particles of a mean radius of @xmath205@xmath206 and a number density of @xmath207@xmath208 was present at a height where ammonia clouds form @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that the observed particles had experienced coalescence , because the particles are too small to collide with each other ( i.e. , for particles smaller than a micron in radius , @xmath209 and hence @xmath210 in the ammonia cloud forming region ) .",
    "therefore , we can infer that the number density of ccn , which is approximately equal to the number density of small particles before coalescence sets in , was @xmath211@xmath149 in the hot spot the galileo probe entered .",
    "interestingly , this value is consistent with our prediction for the ccn density in the equatorial zone and north tropical zone ( see above ) .",
    "we do not think that this comparison justifies our cloud model , because the ccn density in relatively cloud - free hot spots is not necessarily equal to that in cloudy equatorial zone and north tropical zone .",
    "rather , this comparison _ suggests _ that the ccn concentrations in the two regions could be similar .",
    "we have developed a new cloud model for exoplanets and brown dwarfs that is simple but takes into account the microphysics of both condensation and coalescence .",
    "our model produces the vertical distributions of the mass and number densities of cloud and rain particles as a function of physical parameters , including the updraft velocity , the mixing ratio of the condensing gas at the cloud base , and the number density of ccn .",
    "therefore , our model will be useful to understand how the dynamics , compositions , and nucleation processes in exoplanetary atmospheres would affect the vertical structure of exoplanetary clouds via cloud microphysics .",
    "we have tested our model by comparing with the observations of the terrestrial water clouds and the jovian ammonia clouds . for terrestrial water clouds",
    ", our model plausibly reproduces the observed vertical distributions of the cloud mass and number densities from in situ observations when we assume the terrestrial typical updraft velocity , height of cloud base , and ccn number density . for jovian ammonia clouds ,",
    "our model simultaneously reproduces the cloud optical depth , the geometric thickness , and the particle effective radius in the equatorial zone and north tropical zone retrieved from voyager measurements when we assume the updraft velocity of @xmath212@xmath201 and the ccn number density of @xmath213 .",
    "our best - fit updraft velocity is consistent with estimates from mixing theory and from cloud convection simulations .",
    "the best - fit ccn density is close to the number density of small particles in a hot spot measured by the galileo probe , suggesting that the ccn density in the equatorial zone and north tropical zone is similar to that in hot spots .",
    "the good agreement between our predictions and the observations indicates that the coalescence of condensate particles is an important process of cloud formation , not only in terrestrial water clouds but also in jovian ice clouds .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : coal ] ) assumes that two particles stick whenever they collide .",
    "however , this assumption breaks down if the collision velocity is so high that the collision results in bouncing or fragmentation of the particles . in principle ,",
    "solid particles are less sticky than liquid particles because a harder particle has a smaller contact area and hence a small binding energy associated with intermolecular forces @xcite .",
    "our future modeling will take into account the potentially low sticking efficiency of solid dust particles .",
    "we have also assumed that the internal density of condensate particles is constant .",
    "however , the internal density can decrease as the particles grow into porous aggregates through coalescence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because porous aggregates have a larger aerodynamical cross section than compact particles of the same mass , porous aggregates might ascend to higher altitudes than compact ones and provide featureless transmission spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres .",
    "on the other hand , the coalescence of porous aggregates can be faster than that of compact particles @xcite .",
    "if this is the case in exoplanetary atmospheres , the porosity evolution might prevent the formation of high - altitude clouds .",
    "recent theoretical studies of the grain growth in protoplanetary disks have yielded a detailed model for the porosity evolution of grain aggregates based on grain contact mechanics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we will study the impact of porosity evolution on cloud formation by using these theories in future studies .",
    "the authors thank the anonymous referee for useful comments .",
    "we thank hanii takahashi and yuka fujii for useful discussions about observations of terrestrial clouds , and chris ormel for many helpful comments on the manuscript of this paper , and neal turner , shigeru ida , masahiro ikoma , mark marley , yasuto takahashi , and xi zhang for useful comments and discussions .",
    "this work is supported by grants - in - aid for scientific research ( # 23103005 , 15h02065 ) from mext of japan .",
    "for particles much larger than the mean free path of the molecules in air , the terminal velocity of a particle under gravity @xmath214 is given by @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the mass density of the atmosphere , and @xmath217 is the drag coefficient determined by the local reynolds number of the particle , @xmath218 where @xmath119 is the dynamic viscosity of the atmosphere .     versus @xmath219 .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines indicate the stokes and newton drag laws , respectively , and the solid circles show the data for rigid spheres from table 10.1 of @xcite .",
    "the solid line shows our fit , equation  ( [ eq : nre_fit ] ) . ]",
    "because @xmath220 depends on @xmath6 , one needs to solve equations  ( [ eq : vt ] ) and ( [ eq : nre ] ) , together with the relation between @xmath217 and @xmath220 , to obtain @xmath6 as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "following @xcite , we do so by introducing the quantity @xmath221 which does not involve @xmath6 , and analytically express @xmath220 as a function of @xmath222 .",
    "we require the function to reproduce stokes and newton s drag laws , @xmath223 ( @xmath224 ) and @xmath225 ( @xmath226 ) , in the limits of @xmath227 and @xmath228 , respectively . to determine the functional form in the intermediate regime @xmath229",
