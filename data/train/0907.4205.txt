    "the equation of state ( eos ) of hot qcd is an essential input to understand thermal properties of the quark matter in early universe and in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the lattice qcd is the only systematic method to calculate eos for wide range of @xmath0 across the phase transition .",
    "the temperature on the lattice is given by the inverse of the temporal lattice extent : @xmath4 with @xmath1 the lattice size in the euclidian temporal direction and @xmath5 the lattice spacing .",
    "conventionally , finite temperature lattice simulations are performed in the fixed-@xmath1 scheme , in which @xmath0 is varied by changing @xmath5 ( or equivalently the lattice gauge coupling @xmath6 ) at a fixed @xmath1 . because this method requires a large amount of computational resources , most studies have been done with staggered - type lattice quarks which are less demanding among lattice quarks but whose fundamental properties such as locality and universality are not well established . therefore , to evaluate the effects of lattice artifacts , it is indispensable to carry out studies using theoretically sound lattice quarks , such as the wilson - type quarks . for this purpose , we developed the fixed scale approach with the t - integral method which can reduce numerical costs @xcite . to study eos ,",
    "it is convenient to first calculate the trace anomaly @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy density and @xmath9 is the pressure . for the case of quenched qcd , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the lattice beta - function whose non - perturbative values are relatively easy to evaluate .",
    "the subtraction of the zero - temperature counterpart is required for renormalization . to obtain a non - perturbative estimate of @xmath9 , the integral method is usually adopted : using the thermodynamic relation @xmath12 valid in the large volume limit , @xmath13 with @xmath14 . in this conventional method , major part of the computational cost is devoted to zero temperature simulations to set the lattice scale , to carry out zero - temperature subtractions , and to determine the non - perturbative beta functions , at each simulation point . in the full qcd",
    ", lines of constant physics ( lcp s ) should be determined too at @xmath2 .    in this report ,",
    "we push an alternative approach where temperature is varied by @xmath1 with other parameters fixed , i.e.  at a fixed point in the coupling parameter space . while this enables us to commonly use one @xmath2 simulation for all temperatures , the conventional integral method in the coupling parameter space",
    "is inapplicable .",
    "therefore , we propose a new method , `` the @xmath0-integral method '' , in @xcite to calculate the pressure non - perturbatively : using a thermodynamic relation valid at vanishing chemical potential , we obtain @xmath15 with @xmath16 . since the coupling parameters are common to all temperatures , @xmath2 subtractions can be done by a common zero temperature simulation , the condition to follow the lcp is obviously satisfied , and the lattice scale as well as beta functions are required only at the simulation point .",
    "then , the computational cost needed for @xmath2 simulations is reduced largely .",
    "we may even borrow results of existing high precision spectrum studies at @xmath2 which are public e.g.  on the international lattice data grid ( ildg ) @xcite . because the lattice spacings in spectrum studies are usually smaller than those used in conventional fixed-@xmath1 studies around the critical temperature @xmath17 , for thermodynamic quantities around @xmath17 , we can largely reduce the lattice artifacts due to large @xmath5 and/or small @xmath1 over the conventional approach . on the other hand , as @xmath0 increases ,",
    "@xmath1 in our approach becomes small and hence the lattice artifact increases .",
    "therefore , our approach is not suitable for studying the high @xmath0 limit .",
    "note that the merits and demerits of our method are complement to the conventional method .",
    "our merits around @xmath17 may be a good news for phenomenological applications , since temperatures relevant at rhic and lhc will be at most up to a few times @xmath17 .",
    ".simulation parameters on isotropic and anisotropic lattices @xcite .",
    "the beta function is taken from @xcite .",
    "corresponding @xmath2 simulations are done on @xmath18 lattices . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we test the method in quenched qcd using the standard plaquette gauge action @xcite .",
    "simulation parameters are summarized in table [ tab : para1 ] .",
    "the i1 , i2 and i3 lattices are isotropic , while the a3 lattice is anisotropic with @xmath19 .",
    "the temperature ranges cover @xmath20700 mev .",
    "the trace anomaly obtained on isotropic lattices are summarized in the left panel of fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the shaded line represents the result of the conventional fixed-@xmath1 method obtained on a quite large lattice of @xmath21 and the spatial lattice size @xmath22 ( about 2.7 fm around @xmath23 mev ) @xcite . comparing the results on i1 and i3 lattices , we find that the lattice cutoff effects are quite small on these lattices .",
    "on the other hand , the i2 and @xmath21 lattices show small deviations near @xmath17 . these deviations may be explained by the physical finite size effect expected in the critical region . off the critical region ,",
    "all results agree well with each other .",
    "dotted lines in the left panel of fig.[fig1 ] are the natural cubic spline interpolations .",
    "we have sufficiently many data to smoothly interpolate . carrying out the numerical integration ( [ eq : tintegral ] )",
    ", we obtain the pressure shown in the right panel .",
    "error bars shown in the figures represent the statistical errors estimated by the jackknife method . to estimate the systematic error due to the interpolation ansatz",
    ", we show the results of interpolations with the trapezoidal rule ( labeled by `` t '' ) too .",
    "we find that all the results agree well with each other within the statistical errors .    in the t - integral method , @xmath0",
    "is restricted to discrete values due to the discreteness of @xmath1 .",
    "we attempt to directly estimate systematic effects due to discreteness of @xmath0 by comparing the results with those obtained on an anisotropic lattice a2 , which has about 4 times finer resolution in @xmath0 than the i2 lattice . in fig.[fig2 ] left , we compare the trace anomaly on a2 and i2 lattices .",
    "we find that the data points from the a2 lattice appear on the interpolation line from the i2 lattice , while , due to the cruder resolution in @xmath0 , the natural cubic spline interpolation for the i2 lattice slightly overshoots the data on the a2 lattice around the peak .",
    "we note that the height of the peak on the a2 lattice is consistent to those of the fine i3 and @xmath21 lattices . carrying out the numerical integration , we obtain eos shown in fig.[fig2 ] right .",
    "we find that the results are well consistent with each other , suggesting that the systematic errors due to the discreteness of @xmath0 is at most about the statistical errors .",
    "see ref.@xcite for more discussions .",
    "we have presented a new way to calculate eos on the lattice .",
    "our method is complementary to the conventional method , and will have an advantage around the transition temperature .",
    "we note that our method can be easily applied to finite densities using the conventional taylor expansion method .",
    "we are currently investigating eos in @xmath27 flavor qcd with non - perturbatively improved wilson quarks , using the configurations by the cp - pacs / jlqcd collaboration @xcite , which are public on the ildg @xcite . among their simulation points , we have chosen the finest lattice ( @xmath28 fm ) with the lightest u and d quarks ( @xmath29 ) . using the same coupling parameters",
    ", we are generating finite temperature configurations on @xmath30 lattices with @xmath31 , 6 , @xmath32 , 16 , where the pseudo - critical temperature is expected to be around 14 .",
    "preliminary results for heavy quark free energies on these finite temperature configurations are presented by maezawa in these proceedings @xcite , in which another good feature of the fixed scale approach is pointed out : we can study the thermal effects on the heavy quark free energies without artificially adjusting the constant term of the potential .",
    "we hope that we present new results of eos at the next qm symposium .",
    "our final goal is to study eos in @xmath27 flavor qcd just at the physical quark mass point .",
    "we are planning to extend the study using zero - temperature configurations being generated by the pacs - cs collaboration just at the physical point @xcite .",
