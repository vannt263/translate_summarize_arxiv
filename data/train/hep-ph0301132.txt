    "it is widely believed , as suggested by a host of independent cosmological and astrophysical observations , that the most part of the matter in the universe is not visible , revealing its existence only through gravitational effects .",
    "in particular , data on the rotational curves of galaxies indicate that the galactic visible parts are surrounded by approximately  spherical dark halos which extend up to several times the size of the luminous components .",
    "the best candidates to provide dark matter in galaxies are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) .",
    "several wimp direct  detection experiments are operating @xcite , with the goal of measuring the nuclear recoil energy ( in the kev range ) expected to be deposited in solid , liquid or gaseous targets by the scattering of the non - relativistic dark halo wimps .",
    "unfortunately , expected rates are small and the exponential decay of the wimp recoil  spectrum resembles that of the background at low energies .",
    "however , a specific signature can be exploited in order to disentangle a wimp signal from the background : the annual modulation of the rate @xcite .",
    "this effect , expected to be of the order of a few per cent , is induced by the rotation of the earth around the sun . due to its smallness",
    ", the annual modulation signature requires large  mass detectors with high statistics in order to overcome background fluctuations and be unambiguously detected .",
    "the annual modulation effect has been experimentally investigated by the dama collaboration , which has indeed reported a positive evidence by using a 100 kg sodium iodide detector @xcite .",
    "one of the most important sources of uncertainty in the calculation of wimp direct detection rates is the modeling of the velocity distribution function ( df ) of the particles populating the dark halo . in the literature , a simple isothermal sphere model is usually adopted , i.e. a wimp gas described by an isotropic maxwellian with r.m.s velocity of the order of 300 km s@xmath0",
    "this leads to a sinusoidal time  dependence of the expected signal with maximum ( or minimum ) around june 2@xmath1 , i.e. with the same ( or opposite ) phase as the relative velocity between the earth and the halo rest frame .    however , the actual form of the wimp velocity df is unknown , and many different models , alternative to the isothermal sphere , are compatible with observations @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present letter is to show that the main features of the annual modulation effect ( the sinusoidal dependence with time , the occurrence of maxima and minima during the year and , under some circumstances , the one  year period ) may be affected by anisotropies in the velocity df .",
    "the most relevant effect is a distortion of the sinusoidal time ",
    "behaviour at low recoil energies .",
    "these energies , though below the current detector thresholds , might be reached in the future .",
    "the observation of the effects discussed in this letter could provide informations on the phase space distribution of our galactic halo , especially on the degree of its anisotropy .",
    "due to the rotation of the disk around the galactic center , the solar system moves through the wimp halo , assumed to be at rest in the galactic rest frame . in",
    "the following , we will assume a right  handed system of orthogonal coordinates : the @xmath2 axis in the galactic plane , pointing radially outward ; the @xmath3 axis in the galactic plane , pointing in the direction of the disk rotation ; the @xmath4 axis directed upward , perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "notice that our system differs from standard `` galactic coordinates '' by the different choice of the @xmath2 axis , which for us is directed outward .",
    "the relative velocity between the wimp halo and the detector is given by the earth velocity @xmath5 , as seen in the galactic rest frame .",
    "it is the sum of three components : the galactic rotational velocity @xmath6 km s@xmath0 ( we will assume : @xmath7 km s@xmath0 ) , the sun proper motion @xmath8 km s@xmath0@xcite and the earth orbital motion @xmath9@xcite : @xmath10 \\label{eq : vearthx } , \\\\",

    "@xcite . a distortion of the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : ivmin_tangential ] , as compared to the familiar sinusoidal time  dependence , appears : this effect may be explained by the fact that now @xmath93 , a taylor  expansion of the type used in the isothermal sphere case breaks down and a full numerical calculation of the integral of eq.([eq : ivmin ] ) is required .",
    "the final result is not sinusoidal .",
    "this peculiar behaviour is more pronounced at low values of @xmath41 ( i.e. low recoil energies ) namely for @xmath94 80 km s@xmath0 , for which the distortion is strong and the maxima ( in absolute value ) of the rate are shifted as compared to the standard case @xcite . for larger values of @xmath41",
    "the distortion is less pronounced , and it dies away when @xmath95 km s@xmath0 .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that , as @xmath41 grows , the integral of eq.([eq : ivmin ] ) becomes less sensitive to the parameter @xmath96 since it gets increasingly dominated by wimps with velocities along the @xmath3 axis , which is the one along which the boost due to the galactic rotation is directed .",
    "we notice that for values of @xmath41 around ( @xmath97 ) km s@xmath0 a distortion is present , but the amplitude of the modulation is suppressed and therefore difficult to detect .     the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivmin_isotropic ] , for an anisotropic model with @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",

    "this situation is representative of a radial anisotropy . in this case",
    ", we have further enhanced the contribution of @xmath104 over @xmath85 , so that one should expect to draw the same conclusions as in the isothermal sphere case , with the usual sinusoidal time  dependence of the rate and a phase close to @xmath105 .",
    "this is indeed the case , except for a narrow interval of values of @xmath41 around @xmath106 210 km s@xmath0 . in this range , @xmath49 develops two maxima because , for that particular choice of @xmath41 , there is an exact cancellation in the first term of the expansion in @xmath107 , so that the term @xmath108 proportional to @xmath109 $ ] sets in",
    ". this particular cancellation of the first term in the taylor expansion of @xmath49 happens also for the isothermal  sphere model , but in that case the size of the quadratic term is strongly suppressed because @xmath110 is much smaller . in a wimp direct detection experiment",
    "this effect would show up in a very peculiar way : a halving of the modulation period of the rate in a narrow range of recoil energies .",
    "note , however , that in order to have some realistic chance to detect this effect , it should show up in one of the experimental energy bins just above threshold , where the highest signal / background ratio is usually attained .",

    "the different curves refer to wimp masses of : 20 gev ( solid ) , 50 gev ( dotted ) , 100 gev ( dashed ) , 200 gev ( long  dashed ) and 1 tev ( dot  dashed ) .",
    "the dashed vertical lines denote the current energy thresholds . ]    in order to establish a link between our discussion and wimp direct detection experiments @xcite , in fig .",
    "[ fig : vmin ] we plot @xmath41 as a function of the quenched nuclear recoil energy @xmath112 ( @xmath113 is the quenching factor ) for the target nuclei : na , i , ge , te and for different wimp masses .",
    "the vertical dashed lines show current energy thresholds achieved by each type of detector .",
    "[ fig : vmin ] shows that values of @xmath94 80 km s@xmath0 , i.e. sufficiently low to observe a sizeable distortion effect as the one discussed for tangential anisotropy , correspond to wimp recoil energies below the threshold of present direct detection experiments , and that the effect would be more easily detected at higher wimp masses .",
    "however , a foreseeable lowering of the threshold , down to 0.51 kev , could be enough to observe the distortion .",
    "on the other hand , for radial anisotropy , we can conclude that the recoil energy corresponding to a halving of the modulation period can actually coincide to the experimental thresholds within the reach of present  day detectors for 20 gev @xmath114 100 gev , depending on the particular target nucleus . in this respect ,",
    "we note that the properties of the annual modulation effect observed by the dama / nai experiment @xcite ( a one  year ",
    "period sinusoidal behaviour in the 26 kev energy bins @xcite ) implies that the dama / nai experiment is already able to set constraint on strong radial anisotropies .",
    "in the present letter we have shown that the main features of the annual modulation of the signal of wimp direct searches , i.e. the sinusoidal dependence of the rate with time , the position of its maxima and minima during the year and even the period , may be affected by relaxing the isothermal sphere hypothesis in the description of the wimp velocity phase space .",
    "we have considered a multivariate gaussian and found that different situations may occur , depending on the pattern of anisotropy : tangential anisotropies induce a departure at low energies from the usual sinusoidal time  dependence , along with a shift in the position of the maximum of the signal during the year , while radial anisotropies may produce a halving of the modulation period in a particular energy bin .",
    "the former effect turns out to be relevant at low recoil energies , actually below the threshold of present  day experiments , while the latter should be already within the reach of current detectors .",
    "in particular , the properties of the annual modulation effect observed by the dama / nai experiment @xcite may already indicate that strong radial anisotropies are excluded ."
