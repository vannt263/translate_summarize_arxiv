    "increasingly , information on gene expression is used to infer cell protein levels and thus cellular behaviour @xcite .",
    "a further major area of interest is in investigating changes in gene expression levels over time in a population of cells @xcite and this is the subject of the present paper .",
    "we refer to the gene expression levels over time as a gene expression profile , or profile for short .",
    "several methods of analysing gene expression profiles fall into the class of techniques known as unsupervised learning methods .",
    "these methods seek to group genes into a number of classes based upon their observed profiles .",
    "some of the methodologies discussed in the recent microarray literature are hierarchical classification @xcite , self - organizing maps @xcite , the @xmath0-means algorithm @xcite , multivariate gaussian mixtures @xcite , and mixtures of linear mixed models @xcite .",
    "a related problem that arises in applications of microarray time course experiments is to specify , in advance , a gene expression profile of interest and then to identify the genes with matching expression profiles .",
    "however , unsupervised methods do not address this problem and various alternative approaches have been proposed .",
    "one such method is pareto optimization , proposed by @xcite and @xcite , in which a set of functions , each measuring the association of a gene to a pre - specified profile , is chosen .",
    "genes found to be pareto - optimal with respect to these criteria are identified as matching the pre - specified profile .",
    "the main disadvantage with pareto optimization is that some genes will be selected as pareto - optimal genes whilst only matching the pre - specified profile for a subset of the profile s criteria .    in an unpublished paper , @xcite",
    "describe a different method for ranking genes , based on the inner product between the vector of observed log ratios and a pre - specified profile .",
    "this method works well for some profiles , but did not provide useful outcomes in our application .",
    "gene profiling is a new approach developed by the present authors , which aims to identify genes that match a pre - specified gene expression profile , with greater specificity than the previously described approaches .",
    "gene profiling entails treating the vector of true gene expression levels for each gene as a linear combination of linearly independent vectors chosen to represent the pre - specified profile .",
    "the gene - profile model is fitted to the observed log ratios , and the genes are ranked by a single test statistic which incorporates simultaneous differential and equivalent gene expression testing .    in section [ sec :",
    "motivation ] , our motivation for gene profiling is presented .",
    "section [ sec : design ] sets out the details of the experimental design for a pluripotent ( stem cell ) time course experiment which provided our initial motivation for the ensuing methodological development .",
    "the theoretical underpinnings of gene profiling are described in section [ sec : profile ] , which entails a review of equivalence testing ( section [ sec : equiv ] ) and intersection - union tests ( section [ sec : iut ] ) .",
    "the gene profiling methodology is set out in section [ sec : method ] , and the results obtained from our application to a stem cell experiment are presented in section [ sec : results ] . in section [ sec : discussion ] , some further work and how to apply the methods in limma are briefly discussed .",
    "our motivating example is a stem cell experiment originally conducted by the rathjen laboratory , formerly of the university of adelaide .",
    "the aim of the experiment was to identify genes associated with pluripotency in mice embryonic stem cells @xcite .",
    "early stem cells have the potential to differentiate into any body cell : a property known as pluripotency .",
    "this ability is present in mice stem cells up to and including day three .",
    "after this the stem cells become multipotent : they still have the ability to differentiate into different types of cells , but now a limited number .",
    "for example , haemopoetic stem cells can differentiate into blood cells but not nerve cells .",
    "as pluripotency is restricted to the early stem cells , day 3 or earlier , genes that have high expression levels in cells up to day 3 , but low , or monotonically decreasing expression levels thereafter , are likely to be associated with the biochemical pathways involved in the pluripotency ability of these cells ( personal communication , dr chris wilkinson ) .",
    "stem cells were isolated from the early embryo and grown in culture dishes .",
    "the cells were allowed to replicate and grow over the medium in the dish .",
    "once the cells had crowded the plate , they were removed , separated and plated onto new plates .",
    "this cycle of growth and re - plating is called a _ passage_.",
    "the rathjen laboratory isolated mice embryonic stem cells , and for this experiment , used cells from passages 21 , 22 , 23 and 24 .",
    "the cells were stimulated to differentiate into multipotent cells , and on days 0 , 3 , 6 and 9 after stimulation , samples were taken and the messenger rna ( mrna ) obtained .",
    "the gene expressions of the 16 samples of stem cell mrna for the four days ( 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 ) and four passages , were measured . within each passage ,",
    "five comparisons were made , namely , day 0 to day 3 , day 0 to day 9 , day 3 to day 6 , day 3 to day 9 , and day 6 to day 9 .",
    "the experimental design in terms of the true gene expression levels , @xmath1 ( see section [ sec : profile ] ) is summarized in figure [ fig : design ] , while the experimental design in terms of the gene profiling parameters , @xmath2 ( section [ sec : profile ] ) , is compared to the design in terms of the true expression levels in table [ tab : parameter ] . the clone library used in",

    "this neighbourhood is necessary to ensure that the power of the statistical test is greater than its significance level @xcite .    for the gene profiling model , the parameter @xmath21 is taken to be the largest that a gene s mean log ratio can vary around zero and not be of `` significant '' gene expression , according to biologists . in practice , a working understanding of equivalent gene expression",
    "should be decided upon in advance in consultation with biologists .",

    "similarly for @xmath39 .",
    "these methods allow testing of each criterion separately , but for pluripotency all three criteria need to be valid simultaneously .",
    "the authors method to simultaneously test for both equivalence of parameters to zero and significant departures of parameters from zero is described in the next section .",
    "the test for each criterion discussed in section [ sec : equiv ] can be incorporated simultaneously into a single null and a single alternative hypothesis as follows : @xmath46    the hypotheses in ( [ eq : null ] ) and ( [ eq : alt ] ) represent an _ intersection - union test _",
    "( iut)@xcite . to review , in an iut , the null hypothesis is expressed as a union , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a subset of the parameter space indexed by @xmath49 .",
    "the rejection region @xmath50 of this iut is of the form @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the rejection region for a test of @xmath53 versus @xmath54 .",

    "our main aim is to rank the genes in our motivating example according to their match with the pluripotent profile .",

    ", confidence interval inclusion is used to test the associated null hypothesis . rather than using a fixed significance level , the smallest significance level , @xmath59 , for each @xmath62 respectively , is found , such that the null hypothesis is rejected .",
    "the supremum of @xmath63 is used as the test statistic to rank the genes .",
    "in fact , in the stem cell experiment , rather than calculate @xmath64 for each @xmath65 , the width of the largest confidence interval , @xmath66 , for each @xmath67 that was contained within the rejection region was used .",

    "the data were then normalized by within - array print - tip loess , and the gene profile model was fitted to the normalized data using limma @xcite in r @xcite . for each gene ,",
    "the model parameter estimates and standard errors obtained by limma were used to calculate the @xmath74 statistic ( see below ) using c code embedded in r code .",
    "the genes were then ranked using the @xmath74 statistic .",
    "the vector of observed log ratios @xmath75 was expressed as a linear model of the true gene expression levels @xmath1 as follows : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the design matrix representing the mrna comparisons made on each array , and @xmath78 is assumed to be distributed as @xmath79 .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : mu_gamma ] ) to substitute for @xmath1 , gives @xmath80 in the stem cell experiment , the microarray platform used was two - colour long oligonucleotide which , as for cdna microarrays , measures relative gene expression , but not absolute gene expression levels .",
    "therefore , the overall gene expression level , @xmath81 , could not be estimated and was removed from the model by changing the parameter vector to @xmath82 and removing the first column of @xmath83 .",
    "estimates of @xmath2 were calculated via least squares , and the estimate of @xmath84 was obtained using the empirical bayes method utilized in limma ; this gives a robust posterior estimate of @xmath84 based on a prior which `` borrows '' information from the observed variance of all the genes on the array .",
    "for each gene , three tests statistics , @xmath85 and @xmath86 were calculated as follows : @xmath87 where se(@xmath88 ) is the @xmath10th diagonal element of the square matrix : @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is the posterior estimate of @xmath91 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath92 , is used to rank the genes , for which genes with larger values of @xmath74 are more likely to be associated with pluripotency .",
    "genes whose estimate @xmath93 of @xmath82 did not lie within the rejection region , i.e. those genes for which at least one @xmath92 was negative , were excluded from the ranking .",
    "the model ( [ eq : mu_gamma ] ) was fitted to the stem cell data with @xmath94 . in addition , the test statistics were changed to test for @xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath96 . the value of @xmath97 was chosen to ensure a large difference between the gene expression levels on days 0 , 3 and 6 compared with the gene expression level on day 9 .",
    "the ranked genes are given in table [ tab : pluri ] , and the fitted profiles for these 15 genes are shown in figure [ fig : pluri10 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : pluri10 ] shows the fitted log ratios with respect to day 0 for the four time points : day 0 , day 3 , day 6 , and day 9 .",
    "therefore , all of the profiles will pass through zero on day 0 .",
    "the profiles demonstrate the required trajectory : equal expression for day 0 and day 3 , higher gene expression levels for days 0 and 3 compared to day 9 , and the gene expression level for day 6 lying between the gene expression levels for days 0 and 3 and that for day 9 .",
    "the top - ranked gene , oct4 , is well - known to be associated with pluripotency @xcite and would therefore be expected to appear amongst the top - ranked genes for pluripotency in this experiment .",
    "other genes of note in the ranked genes in table [ tab : pluri ] are utf1 ( rank 2 ) which is associated with undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription @xcite , and nanog ( rank 11 ) which is central to embryonic stem cell pluripotency @xcite .    the recent article by @xcite isolated proteins associated with the protein nanog and thus with pluripotency . of the 38 proteins discussed in @xcite , oct4 and",
    "nanog appeared in our list of ranked genes using model ( [ eq : mu_gamma ] ) : ranks 1 and 11 respectively .",
    "the remaining proteins were not in the ranked genes as the profiles of the associated mrnas are not consistent with profile ( [ eq : mu_gamma ] ) .    ) . ]",
    "_ sensitivity analysis _ : as stressed previously , the choice of the neighbourhood around zero assumed for equivalence ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) should be decided upon in consultation with biologists . however , this is problematic since biologists still have relatively little explicit knowledge of gene - wise expression variability , and therefore , what precisely and quantitatively may represent equivalence of gene expression .    to investigate the potential effects of altering the neighbourhood defined by @xmath21 , the primary analysis was repeated assuming , respectively , values of @xmath98 in figure [ fig : sensitivity ] the profiles for the genes which have observed profiles that lie within the rejection region are plotted for each choice of equivalence neighbourhood .",
    "as the equivalence neighbourhood width ( @xmath21 ) increases , more genes have profiles that lie within the rejection region , but there is greater variation between the gene expression levels for day 0 and day 3 . nevertheless ,",
    "gene profiling in this application has been demonstrated to be reasonably robust .",
    "for @xmath21=0.5 , 1 and 1.5 , oct4 was ranked as the top gene , while for @xmath21=2 , it had only dropped to rank 2 .     0.5 , ( b ) @xmath99 1 , ( c ) @xmath99 1.5 , and ( d ) @xmath99 2 . ]    _ profiling for sox2 _ : it is well known that the gene sox2 is commonly associated with pluripotency @xcite , but it was not in the ranked genes using the gene expression profile ( [ eq : mu_gamma ] ) : the fitted gene expression profile for sox2 is very different from the pluripotent profile used in the analysis .",
    "the criteria for the profile of sox2 are : higher gene expression level on day 0 compared to the gene expression levels for days 6 and 9 ; equivalent gene expression levels on days 6 and 9 ; and the gene expression level for day 3 to lie between the gene expression level for day 0 and the levels for days 6 and 9 .",
    "gene profiling can be used to rank the genes according to these alternative criteria .",
    "an appropriate model for sox2 is : @xmath100 in which @xmath16 is unrestrained , @xmath101 , @xmath71 , and @xmath30 is equivalent to zero .",
    "this model was fitted to the data and the ranked genes are shown in figure [ fig : sox2_results ] .",
    "the ranked genes were cpt1a , 1200014e20rik , 2210409e12rik , sox-2 , np-1 , birc5 , 5730419i09rik , mgi:1922156 , retsdr3 , and clone rp21 - 505l19 on chromosome 5 .",
    "sox2 was ranked at position 4 .",
    "of note is retsdr3 .",
    "this gene has the required form with a larger difference in gene expression between day 0 and days 6 and 9 compared to the other genes . even with this large difference , retsdr3 is low down in the ranking at rank 9 .",
    "this low ranking is because retsdr3 has a large gene expression variance ( 0.181 ) compared to the other ranked genes ( average gene expression variance of 0.054 ) .",
    "this illustrates that if two genes have the same coefficient values , gene profiling will rank lower the gene which has the larger variance and thus more uncertainty about its true profile .",
    "in general , gene profiles of interest to molecular biologists often consist of two types of criteria : equal gene expression at different time points and differential gene expression at different time points .",
    "gene profiling provides a straightforward methodology to filter genes which satisfy these two types of criteria simultaneously .",
    "we believe that this has not been accomplished using previously available techniques . by simultaneously testing for all criteria ,",
    "gene profiling effectively filters out and excludes genes that are only partially consistent with the required profile .",
    "we now touch on some areas requiring further work .",
    "_ choice of @xmath21 _ : as noted in section [ sec : iut ] , to test for a parameter being equal to zero , a neighbourhood of width @xmath21 is defined .",
    "this neighbourhood is the amount that the parameter could vary and still be considered equivalent to zero . in this paper ,",
    "the choice of @xmath21 was based on plotting profiles for the various choices of @xmath21 , and choosing the best @xmath21 to give the required pre - specified profiles .",
    "ideally , the choice of @xmath21 should be based on consultation with biologists , to the extent that such knowledge is available .",
    "one would anticipate that such requisite knowledge will gradually accrue over time , as microarray and other new genomics technologies are more widely applied in molecular biology and genetics .",
    "_ invariance of parameterization _ : another area requiring further research is the invariance ( or otherwise ) of reparameterization . in his ( 2002 ) book , wellek notes :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` ... in contrast to the corresponding conventional testing problems with the common boundary of null and alternative hypothesis [ _ sic _ ] being given by zero , equivalence problems remain generally not invariant under redefinitions of the main parameter .

    "the criteria for such genes are : high gene expression level on day 3 , as well as equal and low gene expression levels on day 0 , day 6 and day 9 .",
    "the requisite profile is illustrated in figure [ fig : marker3 ] .",
    "examination of the profile reveals three possible models : @xmath102 where @xmath103 with @xmath16 unrestrained , @xmath38 significantly positive , @xmath104 equivalent to zero , and @xmath30 equivalent to zero .",
    "the three models may not necessarily give the same results .",
    "this is because equivalence is not transitive , i.e. , if @xmath105 is equivalent to @xmath106 , and @xmath106 is equivalent to @xmath107 , it is not necessarily true that @xmath105 is equivalent to @xmath107 .",
    "this is because equivalence is defined in a neighbourhood and so a `` drift '' resulting in @xmath105 and @xmath107 being too far apart to be considered equivalent can occur . methods to impose invariance are currently under investigation by the authors .",
    "although this is an interesting area of research , invariance of reparameterization does not limit the use of gene profiling .",
    "there are many pre - existing statistical tests , e.g. , the wald test , that are not invariant under reparameterization . in many cases",

    "<S> in microarray experiments , it is often of interest to identify genes which have a pre - specified gene expression profile with respect to time . methods available in the literature are , however , typically not stringent enough in identifying such genes , particularly when the profile requires equivalence of gene expression levels at certain time points . in this paper , the authors introduce a new methodology , called gene profiling , that uses simultaneous differential and equivalent gene expression level testing to rank genes according to a pre - specified gene expression profile . </S>",
    "<S> gene profiling treats the vector of true gene expression levels as a linear combination of appropriate vectors , i.e. , vectors that give the required criteria for the profile . </S>",
    "<S> this gene - profile model is fitted to the data and the resultant parameter estimates are summarized in a single test statistic that is then used to rank the genes . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical underpinnings of gene profiling ( equivalence testing , intersection - union tests ) are discussed in this paper , and the gene profiling methodology is applied to our motivating stem cell experiment . </S>",
