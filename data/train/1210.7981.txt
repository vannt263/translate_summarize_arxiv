    "the goal of this paper is to establish a mermin - wagner type result ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) for a spin system on a random graph generated by a _ causal dynamical lorentzian triangulation _",
    "( cdlt for short ) .",
    "the model of a cdlt was introduced in an attempt to define a gravitational path integral in a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "see @xcite for a review of the relevant literature ; for a rigorous mathematical background of the model , cf .",
    "more precisely , we analyze a spin system on a random 2d graph @xmath7 sampled from some natural  uniform \" measure corresponding to a critical regime ( see below ) .",
    "a gibbs random field corresponding to a given interaction potential is considered on graph @xmath7 , giving rise to a quenched semi - direct product measure .",
    "we address the question of whether a continuous symmetry assumed for the interaction potential will be inherited by an infinite - volume gibbsian state .",
    "it had been proved that the hausdorff dimension of the critical cdlt equals 1 a.s .",
    "this means that the emerging graph is essentially an infinite 2d lattice .",
    "consequently , one can expect the absence of spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry . to prove this fact rigorously",
    ", we apply techniques developed in the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we work with so - called rooted infinite cdlts in a cylinder @xmath8 , where @xmath9 stands for a unit circle . physically speaking ,",
    "this is a @xmath10-type system ( one spatial and one temporal dimension ) . in a more realistic @xmath11-type case , a mermin  wagner type result would have been surprising .",
    "consider a connected graph @xmath12 with countably many vertices , @xmath13 , embedded in cylinder @xmath14 .",
    "a face of @xmath12 is a connected component of @xmath15 .",
    "we say that @xmath12 determines a cdlt @xmath7 of @xmath16 if    1 .",
    "all vertices of @xmath12 lie in the circles @xmath17 ; 2 .",
    "each face of @xmath12 is a triangle ; 3 .",
    "each face lies in some strip @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath19 , and has one vertex on one of the circles @xmath20 and two vertices ( together with corresponding edge ) lying on the other circle ; 4 .   the number of edges on circle @xmath21 is positive for any @xmath19 .",
    "it has to be mentioned that some care is needed here when one defines a triangle , due to self - loops and multiple edges ; cf .",
    "we will say that the vertices lying in the circle @xmath22 belong to the @xmath23th layer of the cdlt .",
    "next , define the size of a face as the number of edges incident to it , with the convention that an edge incident to the same face on two sides counts for two .",
    "we then call a face of size 3 ( or @xmath24-sided face ) a _",
    "triangle_.    note that two vertices of a triangle on the same circle , say @xmath25 , may coincide with each other ( in this case the corresponding edge stretches over the whole circle @xmath25 , i.e. , forms a loop ) .",
    "such a situation occurs , in particular , on the circle @xmath26 . in this paper",
    "we consider only the case where the number of edges on the zero - level circle @xmath27 is equal to 1 .",
    "this is a technical assumption made for simplifying the argument .",
    "the root in a cdlt @xmath7 is a triangle @xmath28 of @xmath7 , called the root face , with the anti - clockwise ordering of its vertices @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( and hence the edge @xmath32 ) lie in @xmath26 ( and @xmath30 coincides with @xmath31 ) whereas @xmath33 belongs to @xmath34 .",
    "vertex @xmath30 is referred to as the root vertex .",
    "a cdlt with a root is called rooted .",
    "two rooted cdlts , @xmath7 and @xmath35 , are equivalent if ( i ) @xmath7 and @xmath35 are embeddings @xmath36 of the same graph @xmath12 , ( ii ) there exists a homeomorphism @xmath37 such that ( ii1 ) @xmath38 , ( ii2 ) @xmath39 transforms each circle @xmath40 to itself and ( ii3 ) @xmath39 takes the root of @xmath7 to the root of @xmath35 .    in what follows , rooted cdlts are considered up to the above equivalence .    in the same way we also can define a cdlt of a cylinder @xmath41.$ ]",
    "let @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the set of cdlts with support @xmath44 and @xmath14 correspondingly",
    ".      given a cdlt @xmath45 , define the subgraph @xmath46 by removing , for each vertex @xmath47 , the leftmost edge going from @xmath48 upwards and discarding all horizontal edges , see figure  [ fig.lt-tree ] .",
    "the graph @xmath49 is formed by all the remaining edges of @xmath7 .",
    "the graph thus obtained is a spanning tree of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , if one associates with each vertex of @xmath49 its height in @xmath7 then @xmath7 can be completely reconstructed when we know @xmath49 ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we call @xmath49 the _ tree parametrization _ of @xmath7 .        in a similar way",
    "we can show that there exists a one - to - one bijection @xmath50 between the set @xmath51 and the set of infinite planar rooted trees @xmath52 : @xmath53 we will use the same symbol @xmath50 for the bijection @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the set of all planted rooted trees of height @xmath56 .",
    "owing to the tree - parametrization , we are able to identify a measure @xmath57 on cdlts @xmath42 as induced by a measure defined on trees @xmath55 .",

    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the detailed description of such branching processes .",

    "the conditional gibbs probability density in volume @xmath107 with the boundary condition @xmath108 is defined by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the product - measure on @xmath91 . a gibbs measure @xmath111 on @xmath112 with potential @xmath6 is determined by the property that @xmath113 finite @xmath94 , the conditional density on @xmath91 generated by @xmath111 coincides with @xmath114 for @xmath111-a.s . @xmath115 and @xmath110-a.s .",

    "let @xmath0 be the corresponding size - biased galton - watson tree distribution .    if the potential @xmath6 satisfies assumptions @xmath120 , then every gibbs state @xmath121 with this potential is a @xmath90-invariant measure on the space @xmath122 for @xmath0-a.a .",

    "set @xmath142 where @xmath143 denotes the union of the first @xmath144 layers of @xmath7 .",
    "as before @xmath68 stands for the number of vertices in @xmath7 lying in the layer @xmath28 .",

    ", we set @xmath151    our aim is to check the identity @xmath152 .",
