    "einstein gravity being perturbatively non - renormalizable as a field theory , constructive approaches towards a quantization of gravity have been an ever more active field of research in the past decades @xcite . the dynamical triangulations model in its euclidean and lorentzian versions has proved a successful ansatz for the formulation of such a consistent theory of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "compared to the more fancy methods , such as string theory @xcite and non - commutative geometry @xcite , it is rather more minimalistic in trying to directly model the quantum fluctuations of space - time by a probabilistic sum over an ensemble of discrete , simplicial manifolds @xcite . for the euclidean case in two dimensions ,",
    "this ensemble can be defined as the set of all gluings of equilateral triangles to a regular , usually closed surface of fixed topology , while counting each of the possible gluings with equal weight .",
    "the resulting random - surface model and its simplicial generalisation to higher dimensions are numerically tractable , for instance by monte carlo simulations .",
    "furthermore , for the case of two dimensions the use of matrix models and generating - function techniques led to exact solutions for the cases of pure euclidean gravity @xcite and the coupling of certain kinds of matter , such as the ising model @xcite , to the surfaces .",
    "these two - dimensional theories generically exhibit continuous phase transitions on tuning the relevant coupling parameters accordingly and thus allow for taking the intended continuum limit . in the case of matter variables coupled to two - dimensional dynamical triangulations , the critical exponents governing the transitions are conjectured exactly from conformal field theory as functions of the exponents on regular lattices via the so - called kpz / ddk formula @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the original scaling weight , @xmath3 the scaling weight after coupling to gravity and @xmath4 the central charge . the field - theory ansatz leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : kpz ] ) breaks down for central charges @xmath5 , an effect which has been termed the @xmath6 `` barrier '' , whereas the discrete model of @xmath5 matter coupled to dynamical triangulations stays well defined .",
    "this mismatch of descriptions and its driving mechanism is still one of the rather poorly understood aspects of the dynamical triangulations model @xcite .",
    "ice - type or vertex models on _ regular _ lattices form one of the most general classes of models of statistical mechanics with discrete symmetry ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite ) .",
    "special cases of this class of models can be mapped onto more well - known problems such as ising and potts models or graph colouring problems @xcite . for the case of two - dimensional lattices ,",
    "several of these vertex models can be solved exactly , yielding a very rich and interesting phase diagram including various transition lines as well as critical and multi - critical points @xcite .",
    "thus , for two - dimensional vertex models one has the rare combination of a rich structure of phases and an exceptional completeness of the available analytical results .",
    "hence , coupling this class of models to a fluctuating geometry of the dynamical triangulations type is of obvious interest , both as a prototypic model of statistical mechanics subject to annealed connectivity disorder and as a paradigmatic type of matter coupled to two - dimensional euclidean quantum gravity .",
    "recently , the use of matrix model methods led to a solution of the thermodynamic limit of a special 6-vertex model , the @xmath0 model , coupled to planar @xmath7 graphs @xcite .",
    "it was found to correspond to a @xmath6 conformal field theory , i.e. , it lies on the boundary to the region @xmath5 , where the kpz / ddk solution @xcite breaks down .",
    "also , a special slice of the 8-vertex model could be analysed via transformation to a matrix model @xcite .",
    "a generalisation of this result to the general parameter space of the 8-vertex model is currently being attempted @xcite . however , owed to the method of matrix integrals , these studies neither reveal the behaviour of the matter related observables and the details of the occurring phase transitions nor the fractal properties of the graphs such as , e.g. , their hausdorff dimension .",
    "especially , for the case of the 6-vertex model , which turns out to exhibit a phase transition of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type , quantities related to the staggered , anti - ferroelectric order parameter can not be easily constructed , such that a detailed numerical analysis of the problem seems valuable .",
    "numerically it is found here that , due to the combined effect of the presence of logarithmic corrections to scaling expected for a @xmath6 theory and the comparative smallness of the effective linear extent of the accessible graph sizes , the leading scaling behaviour is obscured by extremely strong finite - size corrections .",
    "thus , a very careful scaling analysis incorporating the various correction terms has to be performed in order to disentangle the corrections from the asymptotic scaling form .    since the 6- and 8-vertex models of statistical mechanics",
    "are defined on a lattice with four - valent vertices , instead of considering dynamical triangulations or the dual planar , `` fat '' ( i.e. , orientable ) @xmath8 graphs , one has to use an ensemble of dynamical _ quadrangulations _ or the dual @xmath7 feynman diagrams as the geometry to model the coupling of vertex models to quantum gravity .",
    "this can be rather easily done within the framework of matrix model methods @xcite . for monte carlo studies , however , it turns out that the well established simulation techniques for dynamical triangulations @xcite are quite cumbersome to adapt to the case of four - valent graphs which , therefore , only very scarcely have been considered in the literature @xcite . especially , ergodicity for the selected set of moves has to be ensured and a method of coping with the observed severe critical slowing down of the dynamics , such as an adaption of the `` baby - universe surgery '' method @xcite , has to be devised .",
    "the details of these modifications to the simulation scheme will be presented in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vertex ] we first review the basic properties of vertex models on regular lattices .",
    "we shortly discuss the matrix - model solution of the 6-vertex model and elaborate on the necessary conceptual and simulational modifications for considering vertex models on random graphs .",
    "section [ sec : pt ] is devoted to an in - depth investigation of the bkt phase transition of the 6-vertex @xmath0 model coupled to planar , `` fat '' @xmath7 graphs by means of an extensive series of monte carlo simulations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : geom ] we present our numerical results for the geometrical properties of the coupled system , such as the string susceptibility exponent and the internal hausdorff dimension .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "an _ ice - type _ or _ vertex _ model was first proposed by pauling @xcite as a model for ( type i ) ice . in this model ,",
    "the two possible positions of the hydrogen atoms on the bonds of the crystal formed by the oxygens , if symbolised by arrows , lead to six different allowed configurations around a vertex provided that the experimentally observed _ ice rule _ is satisfied , stating that each vertex has two incoming and two outgoing arrows , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite . while for the original ice model all vertex configurations were counted with equal probability , for the general 6-vertex model vertex energies @xmath9 are introduced , resulting in boltzmann factors @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes temperature and @xmath12",
    "is the boltzmann constant .",
    "some symmetry relations are commonly assumed between the weights @xmath13 ; in particular , given the interpretation of the arrows as electrical dipoles , in the absence of an external electric field the partition function should be invariant under a simultaneous reversal of all arrows , leading to the identities @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . an especially symmetric version of the model assumes @xmath17 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "this so - called @xmath0 model @xcite turns out to exhibit an _",
    "anti-_ferroelectrically ordered ground state .",
    "the square - lattice , zero - field 6-vertex model has been solved exactly in the thermodynamic limit by means of a transfer matrix technique ( bethe ansatz ) by lieb @xcite and sutherland @xcite .",
    "the analytic structure of the free energy is most conveniently parameterised in terms of the variable @xcite @xmath21 the free energy takes a different analytic form depending on whether @xmath22 , @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "thus , phase transitions occur , whenever @xmath25 .",
    "the case @xmath24 corresponds to two symmetry - related ferroelectrically ordered phases termed i and ii , @xmath22 denotes an anti - ferroelectrically ordered phase iv and @xmath23 is attained in the disordered phase iii .",
    "the latter phase has the peculiarity of having an infinite correlation length throughout , which can be traced back to the fact that it corresponds to a critical surface of the more general 8-vertex model @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta_def ] ) it is obvious that the @xmath0 model exhibits a phase transition on cooling down from the infinite - temperature point @xmath26 contained in the disordered phase iii to somewhere in the anti - ferroelectrically ordered phase iv . the transitions i @xmath27 iii and ii @xmath27 iii are first - order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the transition iii @xmath27 iv of the @xmath0 model , on the other hand , exhibits an essential singularity of the free energy known as the bkt phase transition @xcite .",
    "while the ferroelectrically ordered phases exhibit an overall polarisation which can be used as an order parameter for the corresponding transition , the anti - ferroelectric order of phase iv is accompanied by a _",
    "staggered _ polarisation with respect to a sub - lattice decomposition of the square lattice .",
    "that is , when decomposing the square lattice into two new square lattices tilted by @xmath28 against the original one , the anti - ferroelectric ground states correspond to a _",
    "ferroelectric _ ordering of the vertices of the sub - lattices with opposite signs of the overall polarisation of the sub - lattices .",
    "an order parameter for the corresponding transition can be defined by introducing overlap variables @xmath29 for each vertex of the lattice such that @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the arrow configuration at vertex @xmath32 , @xmath33 one of the two anti - ferroelectric ground - state configurations and the product `` @xmath34 '' symbolises the overlap given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 numbers the four edges around each vertex and @xmath37 should be @xmath38 or @xmath39 depending on whether the corresponding arrow of @xmath40 points out of the vertex or into it @xcite .",
    "then , the _ spontaneous staggered polarisation _",
    "@xmath41 vanishes in the disordered phase and approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit for low temperatures in phase iv and can thus be used as an order parameter for the anti - ferroelectric transition .",
    "vertex models on regular lattices are closely linked with different series of integrable models , which in turn are related to an exhaustive enumeration of certain conformal field theories .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the 6-vertex model , being the critical version of the 8-vertex model , includes in suitable generalisations the critical points of all of the well - known two - dimensional lattice models of statistical mechanics , including the ising and potts models as the most prominent examples .",
    "especially , the restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) models @xcite , which realise each central charge of the unitary series of minimal models @xcite , have been shown to asymptotically map onto the 8-vertex model , such that the critical rsos models correspond to 6-vertex models .",
    "furthermore , an impressive series of models in two dimensions can be mapped onto the coulomb gas @xcite . in these mappings ,",
    "an intermediate step is always given by models of the solid - on - solid ( sos ) type , which again can be related to vertex models @xcite .",
    "combining these methods , the 6-vertex model can be described as the common element among critical systems in two dimensions @xcite .      putting a vertex model onto a _",
    "random _ four - valent graph such as the quantum gravity @xmath7 graphs imposes an additional restriction on the class of vertex weights that can be sensibly considered .",
    "the ferroelectrically ordered phases i and ii of the 6-vertex model and the order parameter describing the corresponding phase transition depend on the existence of a global notion of direction . on a random graph , this notion is maldefined .",
    "the only local orientational structure available is that of the vertices and faces of the graph .",
    "thus , for an 8-vertex model coupled to quantum - gravity @xmath7 random graphs , one has to assume that @xmath19 , while the other vertex types can still be distinguished with only a cyclic ordering of the links around each vertex .",
    "for the 6-vertex model this leaves only two fundamentally different choices of models to be sensibly considered : the @xmath0 model with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the so - called _ inverse f ( if ) model _ with @xmath42 , @xmath18 , which , however , is not of much interest here due to its lack of an ordered phase .    for the square lattice an order parameter for the anti - ferroelectric transition of the @xmath0 model could be defined by a suitably calculated overlap between the actual state and one of the two anti - ferroelectrically ordered ground states . on a random graph ,",
    "the corresponding ground states are not so easily found and , moreover , vary between different realisations of the connectivity of the graph . hence , to define an anti - ferroelectric order parameter for the random graph case , a different and more suitable representation of the vertex model has to be sought . above",
    ", the anti - ferroelectrically ordered state has been described as mutually opposite ferroelectric order on two complementary sub - lattices .",
    "a decomposition of the square lattice of this kind corresponds to a _",
    "bipartition _ or _ two - colouring _ of its sites .",
    "unfortunately , the considered random @xmath7 graphs are not bipartite in general , preventing an immediate application of this prescription .",
    "when interpreting the vertex - model arrows as a discrete vector field on the lattice , the ice rule for the 6-vertex model translates to a zero - divergence condition for this field .",
    "we thus transform the vertex model from its interpretation as a field on the links of the original lattice to a representation of the curl of this field on the faces of the lattice or , equivalently , the sites of the dual lattice .",
    "following stokes theorem , this is done by integrating the vertex model arrows around the elementary plaquettes . by convention",
    ", plaquettes are traversed counter - clockwise , adding @xmath38 for each arrow pointing in the direction of motion and @xmath39 otherwise . on the square lattice the resulting `` spins '' ( or `` heights '' ) on the plaquettes can assume the values @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : plaquette ] . in this way",
    ", the 6-vertex model can be transformed to a sort of `` spin model '' on the dual of the original lattice .",
    "note , however , that one has rather involved restrictions for the `` spin '' values allowed between neighbouring plaquettes , which would lead to quite cumbersome interaction terms when trying to write down a hamiltonian .     around the plaquettes .",
    "thus , the occurring `` spin '' values are @xmath46.,width=302 ]    in the new representation , the anti - ferroelectrically ordered state of the model again has a sub - lattice structure .",
    "however , in contrast to the sub - lattice decomposition of the original representation , now the _ dual _ lattice is broken down into `` black '' and `` white '' sub - lattices , such that no two plaquettes of the same colour share a link .",
    "then , an order parameter for the anti - ferroelectric transition can be defined as the thermal average of the sum of the plaquette `` spins '' , e.g. , on the `` black '' plaquettes . reflecting the construction of the plaquette `` spins '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : plaquette ] it is obvious that this definition of the order parameter _",
    "exactly _ coincides with the original definition of sec .",
    "[ sec : vertreg ] on the level of configurations .",
    "the difference is , however , that the new definition can be easily generalised to the case of arbitrary lattices , as long as their _ duals _ are bipartite .",
    "this is the case for the planar random @xmath7 graphs we are considering since any planar quadrangulation is bipartite .",
    "thus , we can introduce a two - colouring of the faces of the graphs . while for the square lattice the numbers of black and white plaquettes are always the same , the black and white faces of the @xmath7 random graphs not necessarily occur at equal proportions .",
    "thus , one should take the `` spins '' of both types of faces into account , however `` weighted '' with the colour of the faces .",
    "therefore , the configurational value of the staggered polarisation of the @xmath0 model on a planar @xmath7 random graph @xmath47 can be defined as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 denotes the dual of the graph , i.e. the quadrangulation , @xmath50 the set of vertices of @xmath51 , @xmath52 the `` colour '' of the plaquette of @xmath47 corresponding to the vertex @xmath40 of @xmath49 and @xmath53 the plaquette `` spin '' at @xmath40 . recalling the construction of the plaquette `` spins '' , this can also be written in terms of the @xmath7 graph @xmath47 as @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the set of faces of @xmath47 , @xmath56 the links of face @xmath57 , @xmath58 the `` colour '' of @xmath57 and @xmath59 the direction of the vertex - model arrow on link @xmath56 with respect to the prescribed anti - clockwise traversal of the faces .",
    "the thermal average @xmath60 is now taken as the order parameter of a possibly occurring anti - ferroelectric phase transition of the @xmath0 model coupled to planar @xmath7 random graphs .",
    "note , however , that due to the overall arrow reversal symmetry of the vertex model the expectation value @xmath61 will vanish at any temperature for a finite graph .",
    "thus , for finite graphs we consider the modulus @xmath62 instead , analogous to the usual treatment of the magnetisation of the ising model .",
    "as mentioned above in the introduction , a matrix model related to the @xmath0 model coupled to planar @xmath7 random graphs could be solved exactly in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the solution is related to a transformation of the @xmath0 model to a model of close - packed loops by using `` breakups '' of the vertices , i.e. , prescriptions for connecting incoming and outgoing arrows .",
    "the original weights of the 6-vertex model translate into weights for the oriented loops by assigning a phase factor @xmath63 to each left turn and a phase factor @xmath64 to each right turn of an oriented loop @xcite . here , the coupling @xmath65 is related to the weights of the @xmath0 model as of eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta_def ] ) , this choice of weights covers only the range @xmath23 , which corresponds to the disordered phase of the square - lattice @xmath0 model . ]",

    ", on a regular lattice , due to the absence of curvature all loops receive the same constant fugacity @xmath73 , leading to the critical o(@xmath72 ) model . on the considered random graphs this picture only remains valid for the limiting case @xmath74 , where the curvature dependence cancels .",
    "thus , the @xmath74 point of the @xmath0 model on random planar @xmath7 graphs is equivalent to the critical o(@xmath75 ) loop model @xcite and thus , by universality , the critical @xmath76 model ) model are not in general close packed on the lattice as are the loops of the presented loop expansion of the @xmath0 model .",
    "however , the critical o(@xmath75 ) model lies at the boundary of the dense phase of the o(@xmath72 ) model , where loops are close packed @xcite . ] .",
    "note that this corresponds to the same critical point @xmath77 as on the regular square lattice , which is natural since the symmetry breaking is induced by the choice of the vertex weights .",
    "by means of the mentioned matrix model techniques it is found that the @xmath0 model coupled to planar , `` fat '' @xmath7 graphs has a critical point for each value of the coupling @xmath65 ( corresponding to the disordered phase iii ) , in agreement with the behaviour on the square lattice .",
    "exploring the vicinity of this critical point , it is found that the string susceptibility exponent @xmath78 for all @xmath65 , leading to only logarithmic divergences of the free energy @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is indeed expected from the @xmath79 limit of the kpz / ddk prediction eq.([eq : kpz ] ) .",
    "thus , the general phase structure of the @xmath0 model coupled to planar random @xmath7 graphs in the grand - canonical ensemble of a varying number of vertices has been found in ref .",

    ", we present a detailed scaling analysis of its thermal properties . as a guideline for the rather involved analysis we used our newly performed set of loop - cluster update simulations of the square - lattice @xmath0 model @xcite , which is computationally less demanding such that much larger system sizes could be investigated . for a general discussion of scaling and fss at an infinite - order phase transition of the bkt type @xcite",

    ", one should keep in mind that due to the dual relation of both models , the rles of high- and low - temperature phases are exchanged in that the @xmath0 model has a critical low - temperature phase , whereas the high - temperature phase is massless in the @xmath76 model .",

    "the six - vertex @xmath0 model represents an example of the limiting case of a critical theory at the `` barrier '' of central charge @xmath6 , where the liouville approach to euclidean quantum gravity in two dimensions breaks down @xcite and the ensemble of planar random graphs coupled to such matter is at the verge of a presumable collapse towards a phase of minimally connected , tree - like surfaces termed `` branched polymers '' @xcite . at the same time , the family of ice - type vertex models of statistical mechanics includes as sub - classes a variety of well - known lattice spin models and combinatorial counting problems and hence the analysis of its coupling to two - dimensional euclidean quantum gravity is that of a prototype model of statistical mechanics subject to annealed , correlated connectivity disorder from random graphs ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for studying the effect of a coupled six - vertex @xmath0 model ,",
    "we generalised the well - established methods of simulating dynamical triangulations to the case of planar quadrangulations and the dual `` fat '' @xmath7 random graphs ; the details of this simulational machinery will be presented in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "we have analysed the critical and off - critical behaviour of this model using a series of extensive monte carlo simulations and subsequent finite - size and thermal scaling analyses .",
    "on the square lattice , this model undergoes an infinite - order phase transition of the kosterlitz - thouless type to an anti - ferroelectric phase of staggered order . expecting similar ordering behaviour to occur for the model on a random quadrangulation , we generalised the corresponding staggered polarisation ( the order parameter ) to the random graph case by a duality transformation of the vertex model .",
    "the scaling analysis of the simulation data is hampered by the presence of extraordinarily strong corrections , which can be traced back to the combined effect of the comparable smallness of the effective linear extents of the considered ( two - dimensional ) lattices due to their large fractal dimension close to four and the presence of logarithmic corrections generically expected for a @xmath6 critical point .",
    "additionally , the form of the critical singularities for a kosterlitz - thouless phase transition severely limits the effectivity of the usual finite - size scaling techniques .",
    "general symmetry considerations imply that the @xmath6 critical point of the random - graph model should occur at the coupling @xmath86 , which is quite remarkably identical to the critical coupling of the square - lattice model . additionally , this is in agreement with a matrix model treatment of the system @xcite . due to the aforementioned strength of scaling corrections ,",
    "a precise determination of the critical coupling from the scaling of the polarisability alone is found to be hard .",
    "a comparison of the peak positions re - scaled according to the mean linear extents of the lattices between the random graph and square - lattice models @xcite , however , shows that the finite - size scaling approaches of both models are indeed very similar , but with larger correction amplitudes for the random graph model .",
    "subsequently , however , a precise and consistent estimate of the transition point could be extracted from the scaling of the co - ordination number distribution of the graphs .",
    "a cursory comparison of the scaling behaviour of the model for different ensembles regarding the inclusion of singular contributions in the graphs reveals that corrections to scaling _",
    "increase _ as more and more singular contributions are included .",
    "this contrasts with the findings for pure gravity and potts models coupled to the polygonifications model @xcite .",
    "as far as the critical exponents related to the order parameter are concerned , a finite - size scaling analysis of the spontaneous polarisation and the polarisability at the asymptotic critical coupling yields critical exponents in good agreement with the predictions from the kpz / ddk formula .",
    "an attempted _ thermal _ scaling analysis of the polarisability around its peak remains inconclusive due to the extraordinary magnitude of finite - size corrections . as a curiosity , we report the finding of a critical internal energy of the model , @xmath119 , which is identical between the square - lattice and random graph cases .",
    "several aspects of the back - reaction of the matter variables onto the properties of the @xmath7 random graphs are analysed as a function of temperature .",
    "the distribution of co - ordination numbers of the quadrangulations can be determined very accurately .",
    "the fraction of quadrangulation sites of co - ordination number two is found to be peaked around the asymptotic critical coupling , thus defining a pseudo - critical point which determines the infinite - volume critical coupling very accurately . a scaling analysis of the distribution of `` baby universes '' of the graphs in the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite allows to extract the string susceptibility exponent @xmath120 of the model .",
    "it is found to coincide with the value @xmath78 expected for a @xmath6 theory throughout the critical high - temperature phase .",
    "the pure - gravity value @xmath121 is found in the non - critical low - temperature phase . exploiting finite - size scaling relations , we finally analyse the geometrical two - point function of the graphs and extract the fractal hausdorff dimension .",
    "we find it to be consistent with the pure gravity value @xmath122 for all temperatures of the coupled vertex model .",
    "the analogous analyses for the case of pure @xmath7 random graphs convincingly demonstrate the universality of these graph - related critical exponents with respect to a change from triangulations to quadrangulations .    in summary , despite of the presence of scaling corrections of extraordinary size",
    ", a careful analysis of our simulation data allows for an independent confirmation of the location of the critical point and the behaviour of the string susceptibility exponent predicted by the matrix model treatment @xcite . in addition , the behaviour and critical exponents related to the order parameter , energy - related observables , as well as further geometrical properties such as the hausdorff dimension can be reliably determined .",
    "an even richer behaviour can be expected for the 8-vertex model coupled to dynamical quadrangulations , such that its analysis by a series of simulations similar to the one presented here would be a promising future enterprise .",
