[ sec : compsk ] we present the physics case of the @xmath0 neutron gap in calcium isotopes . we describe the experimental energies by using the gogny d1st and the skyrme sly5@xmath7interactions , and we show the need of including both tensor and tensor  isospin terms in the gogny interaction . in sec .",

    "@xcite and indicates a change from a value of about 2.2 mev in @xmath13ca to 4.8 mev in @xmath1ca .",

    "the behavior of the energy gap is controlled by the like  nucleon term of the tensor force . in the skyrme interaction",
    "the contribution of tensor components to the energy density of the system can be written as @xcite @xmath19 + \\beta_{\\rm t } j_p(r ) j_n(r )   \\,\\,\\ , , \\label{eq : skyten}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the proton and neutron spin  orbit densities .",

    "@xcite these parameters assume the values -170  mev  @xmath24 and 100  mev  @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to show that the effect of the tensor interaction is almost zero in spin - saturated nuclear systems , since the effect on the @xmath25 s.p .",
    "level is canceled by that on the @xmath26 one .",
    "the global effect would be exactly zero if the radial wave functions of the two levels were the same .",
    "since calcium isotopes are spin - saturated in protons , the like  nucleon tensor term does not act on protons , and the neutron ",
    "proton contribution is not active in the evolution of the neutron gap .",
    "the consequences of this in the excitation of magnetic states in calcium isotopes have been widely discussed in @xcite .    the sensitivity of our results to the like  nucleon tensor term is shown in the panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : skd1 ] by the dashed line , obtained by changing the sign of the parameter @xmath22 .",

    "the black full line indicates the result obtained with the d1s force @xcite which does not contain tensor terms .",
    "the behavior of the energy gap is analogous to that obtained with the skyrme interaction without tensor term .",
    "the dotted line shows the result obtained with the d1st interaction . in this case",
    "the behavior of the energy gap is opposite with respect to the experimental one , and also with respect to that obtained with the sly5@xmath7interaction .",
    "if the sign of the parameter that determines the strength of the tensor term in the d1st interaction is changed , the results indicated by the blue dashed line in panel ( a ) of fig .  [ fig : skd1 ] are obtained .",
    "we remark that this operation on the d1st force acts only on the tensor ",
    "isospin dependent term and , therefore , changes both the like  nucleon and unlike components of the tensor force . in this way , nuclear properties depending on the neutron ",
    "proton tensor interaction that are well described by the d1st force are not any more reproduced .",
    "for example , the energy of the first @xmath2 state in @xmath3o whose experimental value of 10.94 mev was used to tune the tensor force term in the d1st interaction , appears at 14.48 mev when the sign of the total strength is changed .",
    "evidently , a unique tensor - isospin term in the d1s force is not able to reproduce simultaneously both nuclear properties .",
    "the d1st and d1mt interactions have been constructed by adding a tensor - isospin term to the gogny d1s and d1 m interactions , respectively  @xcite .",

    "the inclusion of this tensor - isospin term was done without changing the values of the other force parameters but the strength of the spin - orbit term .",

    "we have verified that by changing @xmath37 and @xmath38 the result is the same if the sum does not change .",
    "the experimental value of the energy difference is 8.8 mev  @xcite , therefore we have chosen @xmath42  mev .",
    "the second observable we have considered is the energy of the first @xmath2 state in the @xmath3o nucleus . in ref .",
    "@xcite a large sensitivity of the energies of the @xmath2 states in doubly magic nuclei to the tensor - isospin term of the interaction was observed .",

    "mev we obtain for the energy of the @xmath2 the value of 10.72 mev , close to the experimental value of 10.96 mev @xcite .",
    "this choice of @xmath38 , together with @xmath43  mev , implies @xmath45 mev .",
    "we label this parameterization d1st2a .    in order to identify the general features of our results we have implemented another parameterization of the tensor terms , which we call d1st2b . in this case , we selected the like - nucleon part of the tensor force to reproduce the @xmath0 neutron gap increase from @xmath13ca to @xmath1ca as obtained in the hf calculation with the sly5@xmath46 force .",
    "we obtained this results with the value of @xmath47 mev .",
    "as in the previous case , the other observable we have chosen to select the value of @xmath38 is the excitation energy of the first @xmath2 state in @xmath3o . the blue dotted line in fig .",

    ", m3yp5 presents an attractive part for small @xmath50 , that becomes repulsive for @xmath51 @xmath52 .",

    "this effect is enhanced by the inclusion of the tensor term and is more evident for the d1st2b force .",
    "no experimental data are available for the @xmath14 gap , however shell model calculations carried out with microscopic interactions indicate an increase of the @xmath14 gap @xcite .",
    "we discuss another case , in a different region of the nuclear chart , where the experimental values of the s.p energies are known .",
    "we consider the energy gap @xmath4 between the 2@xmath54 and the 1@xmath55 neutron states in oxygen isotopes .",

    "@xcite deduced a value of the energy gap of 4.11 mev in @xmath12o .",
    "this value is relatively large and , for this reason , @xmath12o can be considered a doubly magic nucleus .",
    "this is also supported by the observation that the value of the excitation energy of the first @xmath58 state in @xmath12o is almost twice that observed in the neighboring even  even nuclei .",
    "the results of our calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap14 ] . also in this case the behavior found for the two types of interactions , gogny and skyrme , are rather similar .",
    "the major effects of the tensor terms of the force are present on the neutron 1@xmath55 s.p .",
    "energies which , in @xmath12o are remarkably lower than those obtained without tensor , mainly for the skyrme interaction and in the case of the d1st2b force .",
    "this effect produces an increase of the energy gap , even though the energies of the 2@xmath54 states remain unchanged .",
    "the results obtained with the d1s and sly5 force show a decreasing gap .",
    "in this work , we have first pointed out the need of including in the effective gogny interaction two independent tensor terms acting separately on like  nucleon and proton - neutron pairs .",
    "we have included these two independent terms under the form of tensor and tensor ",
    "isospin components to be added on top of effective gogny forces . to the best of our knowledge , only tensor",

    "the remaining term ruling the proton - neutron term has been selected to the energy of the first @xmath2 excited state in @xmath3o    using these parameterizations , we have calculated the neutron energy gap for @xmath59 14 , 28 , and 90 , in oxygen , calcium and tin isotopes respectively .",
    "our results show that both parameterizations reproduce the trend for the neutron gaps obtained with the skyrme sly5@xmath7interaction , better in the case of the d1st2b fit .",
    "this trend is in agreement with the experimental behavior in oxygen and calcium isotopes , and with the results of shell  model calculations in tin isotopes .",
    "the inclusion of two tensor terms allows us to reproduce the experimental trends of the neutron energy gaps in the isotope chains we have investigated .",
