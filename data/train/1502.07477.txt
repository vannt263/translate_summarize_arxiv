    "* ) are able to simulate their light curves with impressive fidelity .",
    "however , a solution of the reverse problem , to derive all important parameters of the model from observational data , is seldom unique .",
    "if we have observational data of moderate or poor quality , we are often forced to diminish the number of free parameters and thus use simplified ( and frequently physically inconsistent ) models . a decision which parameters to fix or leave floating is usually nontrivial .    nevertheless , for several common practical tasks , such as : 1 )  determination of the mid - eclipse times , 2 )  light curve fitting , 3 )  description and classification of es light curve shapes for the purpose of the current and future surveys like asas or gaia , and 4 )  fine period analysis , we do not need to know the detailed physics of the system .",
    "a good approximation of the shape of observed light curves is usually sufficient in such cases .",
    "we present here a few - parameter general phenomenological model of eclipsing system light curves in the form of the special , analytic , periodic functions that are able to fit an overwhelming majority of the curves with an accuracy better than 1% . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will limit our considerations only to systems with approximately circular orbits that represent more than 80% of observed eclipsing systems .",
    "the model function of a monochromatic light curve ( expressed in magnitudes ) of eclipsing systems @xmath0 , can be assumed as the sum of three particular functions : @xmath1 where @xmath2 describes the mutual eclipses of the components , @xmath3 models the proximity effects , while @xmath4 approximates the oconnell effect ( irrespectively of its physical cause ) .",
    "the normally occurring features of all eclipsing system light curves are two more or less symmetrical depressions caused by mutual eclipses of gravitationally bound stellar or planetary components",
    ". the model function of eclipses @xmath5 can be approximated by the sum of two symmetrical analytic functions of the phase @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the primary eclipse is centered at the phase @xmath7 , while the secondary eclipse ( if one is present ) is centered at phase @xmath8 , @xmath9}{\\left\\{1\\!-\\!{\\left\\{1\\!-\\!\\exp{\\left[1\\!-\\ ! \\cosh{\\left(\\frac{\\varphi_k}{d_k}\\right)}\\right]}\\right\\}}^{\\mathit{\\gamma}_{\\!k}}\\right\\}};\\\\ & \\varphi_k={\\left[\\varphi-(k-1)/2\\right ] } - \\mathrm{round}{\\left[\\varphi-(k-1)/2\\right]},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summation is over the number of eclipses , @xmath10 : @xmath11 or @xmath12 ( the common situation for exoplanet transits ) , @xmath13 are the auxiliary phases defined in the interval @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the central depths of eclipses in mag , @xmath16 is the parameter expressing half - widths of eclipses , @xmath17 are the correcting parameters , @xmath18 parameterize the kurtosis of individual eclipses .",
    "the fit of a transit of the exoplanet tres2b ( @xmath12 ) observed by _ kepler _",
    "( see fig.[fig1 ] ) @xcite utilizes five parameters : @xmath19 .",
    "however , the full description of the model monochromatic light curves with two eclipses ( @xmath11 ) would generally require nine free parameters : @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "nevertheless , the most common situations would permit a reduction to 5 parameters , @xmath22 , because it is usually acceptable to assume that @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 . a detailed discussion of the properties of the eclipse model function @xmath5 and its possible simplifications are given in @xcite .",
    "light variations of eclipsing binaries caused by eclipses are usually modified by proximity and oconnell effects that may be modelled by a sum of cosine and sine harmonic polynomials : @xmath27};\\quad f_{\\rm c}(\\varphi)= \\sum_{k = n_{\\mathrm p}+n_{\\mathrm e}+1}^{n_{\\mathrm c}+ n_{\\mathrm p}+n_{\\mathrm e } } a_k\\,\\sin(2\\,\\pi\\,\\varphi),\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the number of terms in @xmath30 : @xmath31 , @xmath32 if the oconnell asymmetry is not present then @xmath33 , else @xmath34 ( for more information see * ? ? ? * ) .    the uncommon @xmath35 light curve of eclipsing binary v477lyr ( see fig.[477lyr ] ) is determined by 8 parameters : @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the parameters of the above defined model functions , especially the amplitudes @xmath38 , and parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are generally wavelength dependent .",
    "it follows both from the theory and experience that most of the wavelength dependencies can be well approximated by the low order polynomials of the quantity @xmath42 ; @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the effective wavelength of corresponding passband , @xmath45 is an arbitrarily selected central wavelength of the data set . then : @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 or @xmath49 , are the numbers of degrees of freedom of the corresponding parameters of the model .",
    "the standard set of the monochromatic light curve model parameters of eclipsing binaries ( see sec.[monoch ] ) : @xmath50 can be considered as the special case of the multicolour decomposition eq.[multi ] : @xmath51 .",
    "all needed parameters and their uncertainties can be determined using the standard non - linear weighted least square technique ( see in * ? ? ?",
    "the outlined phenomenological modeling of eclipse - binary and planetary - transit light curves has an advantage of high efficiency and simplicity and thus can be used for a wide range of applications ."
