    "the variety of qpo modes from old accreting neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxrbs ) ( see van der klis 1995 ) has been recently enriched by the discovery of kilohertz oscillations in light curves obtained with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) .",
    "these are the first qpos that involve timescales comparable to the dynamical timescales in the vicinity of a collapsed star .",
    "there are currently eleven lmxrbs from which qpos have been detected between frequencies of @xmath5 and @xmath6  khz .",
    "most of these are type i x - ray bursters with persistent luminosities in the @xmath7  ergs  s@xmath8 range , that according to the classification of hasinger and van der klis ( 1989 ) either belong to ( 4u  1728 - 34 , 4u  1608 - 52 , 4u  1636 - 536 , 4u  1735 - 444 and 4u  1820 - 30 ) or are suspected members of ( 4u  0614 + 091 and ks  1731 - 260 ) the  atoll \" group .",
    "sco  x-1 , gx  5 - 1 and gx  17 + 2 are instead high luminosity  z \"- type lmxrbs .",
    "a pair of khz qpo peaks is often present in the power spectra .",
    "this is the case for the persistent emission of the five atoll sources , at least on occasions and/or over some range of count rates . in 4u  1728 - 34 and 4u  0614 + 091 the centroid frequency of the qpos",
    "is positively correlated with the source count rate across the factor of @xmath9 qpo frequency variations ( from @xmath10 to @xmath11  hz ) observed from both sources . when a pair of peaks is present , the difference @xmath12 between their centroid frequencies @xmath13 and @xmath14 is consistent with being constant . in 4u  1728 - 34",
    "@xmath12 remains around @xmath15  hz ( within a few percent ) as the frequency of the khz qpos changes by @xmath16% .",
    "a nearly coherent signal at @xmath17  hz has been detected during a number of x - ray bursts ( strohmayer 1996a ) . in the persistent emission of 4u  0614 + 091",
    "the separation @xmath12 is consistent with @xmath18  hz ( within @xmath19% ) , across a @xmath20% variation of the qpo frequency and a @xmath21  d interval between two rxte observations . during part of an observation",
    ", a third narrower peak has been marginally detected at a frequency of @xmath22  hz , consistent with the separation of the pair of khz qpo peaks ( ford 1997 ) . in the persistent emission of ks  1731 - 260 ,",
    "two khz qpo peaks have been detected around @xmath23 and @xmath24  hz .",
    "the frequency difference ( @xmath25  hz ) between these qpos is consistent with half the frequency of the nearly coherent @xmath26  hz signal observed in a type i burst from this source ( smith 1997 ; wijnands & van der klis 1997 ) .",
    "khz qpos have also been discovered in 4u  1608 - 52 ( berger 1996 ) and 4u  1735 - 444 ( wijnands 1996 ) .",
    "a qpo peak with an intensity - dependent frequency from @xmath27 to @xmath28  hz has been detected in 4u  1820 - 30 .",
    "close to the upper end of this range a second qpo peak at @xmath29  hz is present ( smale , zhang & white 1997 ) . in the persistent emission of 4u  1636 - 536 a pair of qpo peaks around 840 - 920  hz and 1150 - 1200",
    "hz have been detected , the frequency separation of which is constant around @xmath30  hz . a nearly coherent signal at @xmath31  hz modulates the x - ray flux of this source during type i bursts ( zhang 1996 , wijnands 1997 ) ; note that half this frequency is compatible with the separation @xmath12 .",
    "periodic oscillations at 589  hz have also been observed during type i bursts from an unknown burster in the direction of the galactic centre , perhaps mxb  1743 - 29 ( strohmayer 1996b ) .",
    "gx  5 - 1 , gx  17 + 2 and sco  x-1 , currently the only high - luminosity  z \"- type lmxrbs in the group , display khz qpos ( @xmath32  khz ) with a centroid frequency which is positively correlated with the inferred mass accretion rate . in gx  5 - 1",
    "a pair of khz qpo peaks has been detected over part of the horizontal branch ( hb ) , which mantain a constant separation of @xmath33  hz .",
    "the higher frequency qpo peak of gx  5 - 1 increases from @xmath34 to @xmath23  hz as the source moves from the left to the right end of the hb ( van der klis 1996a ) . in gx  17 + 2 a khz qpo peak is observed to drift from @xmath35 to @xmath36  hz qpo as the source moves down the upper part of the so - called normal branch .",
    "a higher frequency peak separated by @xmath37  hz is observed close to the lower end of this range , together with an additional qpo peak around @xmath38  hz , interpreted as hb oscillations ( van der klis 1997a ) . in sco  x-1 , @xmath39  khz qpos have been detected in the normal and flaring branches ; their frequency correlates well both with the inferred variations of the mass accretion rate and the frequency variations of the @xmath40  hz qpo that occur along the two branches .",
    "a pair of khz qpo peaks has been detected on occasions .",
    "however their separation decreased from @xmath41 to @xmath42  hz as the higher frequency peak moved from @xmath43 to @xmath44  hz .",
    "correspondingly additional qpos at @xmath45  hz were present , which are intepreted as hb qpos ( van der klis 1996b , 1997b ) .",
    "modelling of khz qpos has focussed on the presence of peaks at @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the constancy of their separation @xmath12 and the coherence of the signal ( either during type i bursts or in the persistent emission ) at frequency @xmath12 ( or @xmath46 ) ( white & zhang 1997 ) ] .",
    "the application of beat frequency concepts to these signals is natural . in the magnetospheric beat frequency model , mbfm , originally developed to interpret the 5 - 50  hz qpos from high luminosity  z \"- type lmxrbs ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb 1985 ) , matter inhomogeneities in the accretion disk cause accretion to be modulated at the beat frequency between the keplerian frequency , @xmath47 , of the innermost region of the accretion disk ( @xmath48 ) at the magnetospheric boundary , and the neutron star spin frequency , @xmath49 . as @xmath48 decreases with increasing accretion rates , @xmath47 increases and so does the qpo beat frequency @xmath50 .",
    "of the various qpo modes with frequencies @xmath51  hz in  z \"- type lmxrbs , only hb qpos are currently interpreted in terms of the mbfm ( for a review see lamb 1991 ) .",
    "the basic physical picture of the mbfm has been confirmed mainly through the study of qpos in a few accreting x - ray pulsars ( exo  2030 + 375 and a  0535 + 26 in particular ) , where , unlike  z \"- type lmxrbs , the neutron star spin frequency @xmath49 is ( by definition ) clearly detected , and independent estimates of the neutron star magnetic field exist ( angelini 1989 ; finger 1996 ) .    besides the signals at @xmath49 and @xmath52 , an additional qpo signal at @xmath47",
    "is expected in the mbfm from inhomogeneities at the inner disk boundary . for self - luminous blobs ,",
    "the amplitude of this signal should be higher for smaller values of @xmath48 , due to the larger local gravitational energy and keplerian velocities ( causing a larger doppler boosting around the orbit ) .",
    "similarly , a small value of @xmath48 increases the range of inclination angles for which a signal at @xmath47 can be caused by the neutron star occulting the blobs at @xmath48 or conversely , by the blobs at @xmath48 obscuring part of the radiation produced closer to the neutron star surface .    in the mbfm for khz qpos from lmxrbs ,",
    "the lower frequency qpos are interpreted as the beat frequency ( @xmath53 ) and the higher frequency qpos as the keplerian frequency ( @xmath54 ) at the magnetospheric boundary .",
    "the nearly coherent signal , occasionally detected at a frequency compatible with the separation @xmath12 of the qpo pair ( or with @xmath46 ) , provides the first direct evidence of the neutron star spin frequency @xmath49 in lmxrbs containing an old neutron star ( strohmayer 1996a ; ford 1997 ) .",
    "inferred magnetospheric radii @xmath55  km , ( here @xmath56 is the neutron star mass and @xmath57  hz ) correspond to a couple of neutron star radii at the most . the neutron star spin frequency of several hundred  hz and the inferred magnetic field strength of @xmath58  g agree with spin  up by accretion torques , and scenarios for the formation of millisecond pulsars .",
    "miller ( 1996 ) proposed an alternative beat frequency model based on the idea that the magnetic field of the neutron star is so low that it does not affect the dynamics of the innermost disk regions and , yet , high enough to give rise to beamed radiation at the neutron star surface .",
    "we do not discuss the details of this model , but notice that here too the qpo signal at the highest frequency @xmath14 corresponds to the innermost keplerian frequency of the disk , which in this model ends at the sonic radius where the radial velocity becomes supersonic ( as opposed to the magnetospheric radius ) , and the lower frequency @xmath13 is the beat frequency between the keplerian frequency and the neutron star spin frequency , exactly like in the mbfm .",
    "the parameters inferred from beat frequency models for the khz qpo from lmxrbs are such that frame dragging , one of the general relativistic effects of the ",
    "gravitomagnetic \" field associated with rotating bodies , is substantial and can lead to observable phenomena . in particular the orbital plane of a test particle ,",
    "if not coaligned with the equatorial plane , must precess in a prograde fashion around the angular momentum axis of the rotating object . in the weak field limit the nodal precession frequency , first calculated by lense & thirring ( 1918 )",
    "( see also wilkins 1972 ) , is given by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the mass and specific angular momentum of the rotating object and @xmath62 is the radius of the test particle ( circular ) orbit . by using @xmath63 , and @xmath64",
    "this can be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66  g  @xmath67 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star and @xmath68  hz its spin frequency . by using the values of @xmath49 and",
    "@xmath47 inferred from the application of beat frequency models to the khz qpos from lmxrbs , it is apparent that lense  thirring",
    "frequencies of a few tens of hz are expected in the innermost disk region which produces the qpo signal at @xmath47 .",
    "note also that in this regime , higher order terms in @xmath69 would provide a correction to eq .",
    "( 1 ) at a level of less than one percent .    since sources with a pair of khz qpo peaks allow identification of both @xmath47 and @xmath49 , the only parameter in eq .",
    "( 1 ) that is not immediately identified from observations is @xmath70 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty in its determination depends on the choice of the equation of state ( eos ) and the star mass : from models of rotating neutron stars ( friedman , ipser and parker 1986 ; cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1994 ) , it can be seen that @xmath70 varies in the range @xmath71 for any mass and eos .",
    "we notice that @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is thus independent of any other uncertainty related to lmxrbs , such as source distance , mass accretion rate or efficiency of conversion of gravitational energy into radiative energy .",
    "the neutron star spin frequencies discussed here lead to a stellar oblateness which , in turn , causes the appearance of a quadrupole term in the gravitational potential .",
    "it is well  known that the quadrupole term causes a precession of orbits tilted away from the star equatorial plane , with the precession frequency @xmath73 ( as opposed to @xmath74 for the lense - thirring precession ) . for the small radii of interest to us , it is important to check that this classical precession rate is still smaller than the lense  thirring rate , to make sure that the effect we predict is a genuine relativistic one .",
    "the classical precession frequency @xmath75 is given by ( kahn and woltjer 1959 ) @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the tilt angle off the equatorial plane , and @xmath78 is the coefficient of the quadrupole term in an expansion of the gravitational potential in spherical harmonics , @xmath79 , with @xmath80 the second order legendre polynomial .",
    "outside the star , we have @xmath81 , where the coefficient @xmath82 is given , in terms of the star moment of inertia , by @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the star rotation axis . for rotationally flattened stars , far from breakup , @xmath85 . for rotationally flattened stars , @xmath86 , and both @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    "are increased by rotation . in the existing literature",
    "we have been able to find only the numerical values of @xmath89 for non - rotating neutron star models and the corresponding rotation  increased values , @xmath90 ( friedman , ipser and parker 1986 , cook , shapiro and teukolsky 1994 ) .",
    "using the rotating polytropic models calculated by james ( 1964 ) , we derived the approximate relation @xmath91 . assuming that this holds also for neutron star models , we have @xmath92 .",
    "this is probably a fairly accurate approximation because the rotation frequencies we are interested in , @xmath93 , correspond to still slowly rotating neutron star models : in fact , perusal of the tabulated models in the references given above shows that the ratio @xmath94 of rotational to binding energy for these @xmath49 is @xmath95 , while models nearly at breakup have @xmath96 , for all eos .",
    "we find , defining @xmath97 , where @xmath98 , that the parameter @xmath99 is roughly independent of spin frequency in the slow  rotation regime of interest here , and it depends , albeit weakly , upon model mass and eos ( range of @xmath100 ) . eventually , we find @xmath101 note that the negative sign reflects the fact that classical precession is retrograde for @xmath102 .",
    "comparison of this with equation [ 1 ] shows that , even at these small radii , lense  thirring precession is faster .",
    "the total precession frequency @xmath103 is thus somewhat decreased by oblateness  induced precession .",
    "modulation of the x - ray flux at the precession frequency of the inner disk boundary is expected to occur through the same geometrical effects producing the modulation at the keplerian frequency .",
    "in fact , the precessional motion of the blobs generating the signal at @xmath47 would give rise to a signal at the precession frequency , both for self - luminous blobs ( the projected velocity along the line of sight and , therefore , the doppler boosting will be modulated at the precession frequency ) and occulting , or occulted , blobs ( the duration of the occultations wiil depend on the phase of the precessional motion ) .",
    "moreover we note that , unlike the signal at @xmath47 , an x - ray modulation at the precession frequency can in principle be generated , even in the absence of blobs , by the changing aspect of the innermost disk ring .",
    "this would modulate the ring emission as seen from the earth or could partially occult the emitting regions close to the neutron star surface .",
    "lense  thirring precession of viscous accretion disks is generally neglected because , following the pioneering work by bardeen and patterson ( 1975 ) , many authors found that viscosity leads the disk to lie in the equatorial plane of the rotating object .",
    "however , this conclusion has recently been challenged by ( some of ) the same authors : even if the innermost disk regions are confined to the equatorial plane of the neutron star , pringle ( 1996 ) and maloney , begelman and pringle ( 1996 ) have shown that radiation pressure can lead to corrugation of the disk and its lifting off the neutron star equatorial plane .",
    "pringle ( 1996 ) has shown that even initially planar disks are unstable to warping , so that tilting should be generic in centrally illuminated sources .",
    "precessing disks have also been recently revisited by papaloizou ( 1997 ) .",
    "it is possible that other effects , such as parametric amplification ( binney 1978 ) of the z  oscillations of diamagnetic blobs by a dipolar magnetic field tilted with respect to the star spin axis , may intervene ( vietri and stella , in preparation ) .",
    "the power spectra of 4u  1728 - 34 given in fig .",
    "1a clearly show a broad peak centered around a frequency of @xmath16 , 26 and 35  hz when the higher frequency qpo peak is at a frequency of @xmath104 , 980 and 1100  hz , respectively .",
    "the width of the @xmath105  hz peak is of @xmath106  hz .",
    "the power spectrum of 4u  0614 + 091 ( see fig .",
    "1b ) and ks  1731 - 260 ( see fig .",
    "1c ) also shows a similarly broad peak centered around @xmath107  hz and @xmath108  hz , when @xmath104  hz and @xmath109  hz , respectively .",
    "we propose that these tens of hz qpo peaks arise from the precession of the innermost disk regions , where the signals at the keplerian and beat frequencies also originate .",
    "the thick bars in fig .",
    "1 represent the precession frequency calculated from the sum of the lense - thirring and classical frequencies ( eqs .  1 and 3 ) by using @xmath110 ( see above ) , and @xmath111 , 323 and 262  hz in the case of 4u  1728 - 34 , 4u  0614 + 091 and ks  1731 - 260 , respectively . in all three cases",
    ", we adopted the same neutron star model with eos l , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( friedman , ipser & parker 1986 ) .",
    "lense - thirring precession dominates , with the classical term providing a @xmath16% correction .",
    "the fact that the ( absolute ) width of the tens of hz qpo peaks is comparable to that of the khz qpo peaks indicates that lifetime broadening dominates the coherence in both cases .",
    "both @xmath47 and @xmath49 are independently determined in these three sources .",
    "thus the range of precession frequencies allowed by the model is determined _ only _ by the neutron star parameters @xmath115 and , to a lesser extent , @xmath116 and @xmath99 .",
    "the intervals marked by the filled squares and thick bars in fig .  1",
    "represent the whole range of precession frequencies that has been obtained by using virtually all neutron star models given by friedman , ipser & parker ( 1986 ) and cook , shapiro & teukolsky ( 1994 ) ( we excluded models with @xmath117 and  supramassive \" models ) .",
    "we regard the very good agreement with the frequency of the corresponding power spectrum peaks as a strong indication in favor of our relativistic plus classical precession interpretation .",
    "we note that for all three sources the qpo peaks are very close to the high - frequency end of the intervals corresponding to the relatively stiff eos l and @xmath118 .",
    "as the frequency of the khz qpos from 4u  1728 - 34 varied , the best fit precession frequency remained in good agreement with the observed peak , showing that the power law dependence ( eq .  [ 1 ] ) is probably in the correct range .",
    "the detection of khz qpos in the hb of gx  5 - 1 is especially important for the modelling of qpos in  z \"- type lmxrbs .",
    "if one retains the standard interpretation in which the @xmath119  hz qpos in the hb arise from the mbfm , then a magnetosphere extending up to @xmath120 neutron star radii is required ( implying a magnetic field of @xmath121  g ) which argues against any interpretation of the khz qpos involving keplerian orbits at @xmath106  km . if on the contrary , a keplerian beat frequency model is adopted for the khz qpos , then the @xmath119  hz qpos are unlikely to arise from the mbfm .",
    "we regard the presence of a pair of khz qpos and the constancy of their frequency difference as strong evidence in favor of the latter interpretation . in this context",
    ", it appears natural to interpret also the hb qpos of gx  5 - 1 in terms of our precession model . for @xmath122  hz and @xmath123  hz , the maximum precession frequency ( again the one from eos",
    "l and @xmath124 ) is @xmath125  hz . similarly in the case of gx  17 + 2 , we obtain a maximum precession frequency of @xmath107  hz , when the source is in the upper normal branch with @xmath126  hz and @xmath127  hz , and hb qpos at @xmath38  hz are simultaneously present .",
    "these precession frequencies are clearly a factor of 22.5 smaller than those of the hb qpos .",
    "one possibility is that the neutron stars of  z \"- type lmxrbs have @xmath128 , _",
    "i.e. _ a somewhat higher value than friedman , ipser & parker ( 1986 ) and cook , shapiro & teukolsky ( 1994 ) calculate .",
    "alternatively the hb qpos might arise from the second harmonics of the precession frequency , due to some yet unknown reason .",
    "we note that in the case of gx  5 - 1 the dependence of the hb qpo frequency on @xmath14 is in the same range as the dependence of @xmath129 on @xmath47 in our model .    in summary , we propose that the peaks observed in the power spectra of several  atoll \" lmxrbs at a frequency of tens of @xmath130 ( and perhaps also the hb qpos of  z \"- type lmxrbs ) are due to precession of the innermost disk region , which is dominated by the lense - thirring effect .",
    "the precession frequency depends upon the keplerian frequency at the innermost disk radius , and the neutron star spin frequency , both of which are independently determined through the application of beat frequency models to the khz qpos from these sources .",
    "the best fit is obtained for a stiff eos and @xmath124 , a value supported also from the interpretation of the highest observed values of @xmath14 in terms of the keplerian frequency of the marginally stable orbit ( kaaret , ford & chen 1997 ; zhang , strohmayer & swank 1997 ) .",
