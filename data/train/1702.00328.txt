    "poromechanics , that is to say the coupled flow and mechanics of porous media , plays a crucial role in many societal relevant applications . these include geothermal energy extraction , energy storage in the subsurface , @xmath0 sequestration and understanding of biological tissues . the increased role played by computers for the development and optimisation of ( industrial ) technologies for these applications",
    "enhances the need for improved mathematical models and robust numerical solvers for poromechanics .",
    "the most common mathematical model for coupled flow and mechanics in porous media is the linear , quasi - stationary biot model @xcite .",
    "the model consists of two fully coupled partial differential equations , representing balance of forces for the mechanics and conservation of mass for ( single - phase ) flow in porous media . in terms of modelling ,",
    "non - linear extensions are considered in @xcite or non - stationary biot , i.e. biot - allard model in @xcite .",
    "these coupled ( linear or non - linear ) equations are in practice impossible to solve analytically , and very challenging to solve numerically .    it has been widely acknowledged that only simulation with fully coupled fluid potential and mechanical deformation is accurate for non - linear poro - mechanical processes @xcite . nevertheless , due to the complexities associated with monolithic solvers for the full non - linear problem , industry standard remains to use so - called weakly , or iteratively , coupled approaches @xcite .",
    "these de - coupled approaches lead to significant numerical diffusion , which may also mask fundamental numerical incompatibilities between the spatial discretizations .    as a response to this current status ,",
    "the objective of this paper is to show how a simple linearization technique , i.e. the @xmath1-scheme ( see @xcite for application of this method to richards equation or two - phase flow in porous media ) can be combined with a splitting algorithm ( known both as the undrained split or the fixed stress method @xcite ) to obtain a robust and efficient iterative scheme for solving a non - linear biot model .    in this paper",
    ", we use for concreteness linear conformal galerkin elements for the discretization in space of the mechanics equation and mixed finite elements for the flow equation @xcite .",
    "precisely , the lowest order raviart - thomas elements are used @xcite .",
    "we expect , however , that the solution strategy discussed herein will be applicable to other combinations of spatial discretizations such as those discussed in @xcite and the references therein .",
    "backward euler is used for the temporal discretization .",
    "multirate time discretizations or higherorder space - time galerkin method have been also proposed for the linear biot model in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we propose two new iterative methods for solving the resulting non - linear equations at the new time - level : a splitting algorithm based on a combination between the undrained split and the fixed stress methods ( as mentioned above ) and a monolithic approach based on the same linearization technique .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of a solution for the both formulations , as well as their global , linear convergence are rigorously shown . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "these are the first rigorous convergence results for iterative ( monolithic or splitting ) schemes in the non - linear case . at the same time",
    ", we also acknowledge that while the non - linearities considered here are representative for compressible materials , they are simpler than those encountered in more complex applications such as multiphase flow .",
    "to summarise , the new contributions of this paper are    * we propose splitting and a monolithic l - scheme for a non - linear biot model . * the linear convergence of both schemes is rigorously shown in energy norms .",
    "* we provide a benchmark for the convergence of splitting algorithms for the non - linear biot model , including a comprehensive comparison between the splitting and monolithic l - scheme .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section we present the mathematical model and the discretization , including the fully discrete computational schemes . in section [ sec : convergence ] we analyse rigorously the proposed schemes .",
    "numerical results are presented in section [ sec : numericalresults ] , and we conclude the paper in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this paper we use typical notations from functional analysis .",
    "let @xmath2 be an open and bounded domain with a lipschitz continuous boundary @xmath3 , with @xmath4 being the dimension of the space .",
    "we denote by @xmath5 the space of square integrable functions and by @xmath6 the sobolev space @xmath7    furthermore , @xmath8 will be the space of functions in @xmath6 vanishing on @xmath3 and @xmath9 the space of vector valued function having all the components and the divergence in @xmath5",

    "moreover , both schemes are even more sensitive on the choice of the tuning parameter @xmath14 .",
    "we point out that the schemes are converging also for @xmath15 , but the convergence is slow ( around 200 iterations ) .",

    "we have proposed two linearisation schemes for the non - linear biot model , a monolithic l - scheme and a splitting l - scheme .",
    "the convergence of both schemes has been rigorously shown , similar techniques as in @xcite and @xcite being involved .",
    "the schemes are linearly , but global convergent and they are not involving the computations on any derivatives ( as in the case of the newton method ) . two illustrative numerical examples , an academic one and a non - linear extension of mandel s problem were implemented for testing the performance of the schemes . to summarise , we make the following remarks :    * both schemes are very robust with respect to the choice of the tuning parameter , the mesh size and time step size . *",
    "the tuning parameters @xmath27 have a strong influence on the speed of the convergence , with @xmath14 being the dominant one .",
    "* the two schemes ( splitting and monolithic ) performed similarly with respect to parameters @xmath27 , cpu time and number of iterations when no preconditioning was applied .",
    "when preconditioned , the splitting l - scheme is faster . *",
    "the splitting l - scheme can be used both as a robust solver or as a preconditioner to improve the performance of a monolithic solver * the convergence of the schemes is faster for higher permeability . *",
    "the convergence of the schemes is almost independent of the mesh size , and varies only slightly with the biot coupling parameter .    according to the results in section [ sec : convergence ]",
    ", we should observe a faster convergence for the pressure variable when we increase the time step size .",
