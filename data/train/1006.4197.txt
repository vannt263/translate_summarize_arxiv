    "the study of photoproduction of light vector mesons ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath4 ) plays an important role in hadron physics to understand the nonperturbative aspect of qcd . at high energies ( @xmath9 gev ) ,",
    "pomeron exchange in the @xmath6 channel describes well the photoproduction mechanism in the framework of vector - meson dominance .",
    "the pomeron is introduced in the regge theory for describing high - energy hadron scattering , and it is generally believed to originate from multi gluon exchange processes . at low energies near threshold ( @xmath10 gev ) ,",
    "the reactions are open to the exchange of mesons and baryons , where possible `` missing resonances '' could be involved .",
    "in particular , the gluon dynamics dominates in the @xmath4-meson production process because the quark exchange is suppressed by the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule owing to the major @xmath11 content of the @xmath4 meson .",
    "therefore , the photoproduction of @xmath4 mesons at low energies provides a unique opportunity to explore the behavior of pomeron exchange and to study exotic hadronic interactions mediated by multi gluon exchanges .",
    "in fact , @xmath4-meson photoproduction from protons and deuterons has been measured in the laser electron photon beamline at spring-8 ( leps )  @xcite , the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) at jefferson lab  @xcite , and the spectrometer arrangement for photon induced reactions ( saphir ) at bonn  @xcite .",
    "spin observables are known to be a powerful tool to obtain further insights into the relevant reaction mechanisms . with the use of",
    "linearly polarized photons , the decay angular distribution of the vector meson @xmath4 can be expressed in terms of the real or imaginary part of nine spin - density matrix elements ( @xmath12 )  @xcite .",
    "these matrix elements are sensitive to the underlying reaction mechanism  @xcite .",
    "for example , the matrix element @xmath13  reflects the asymmetry in the contribution from natural - parity and unnatural - parity exchange  @xcite .",
    "there were some measurements of decay asymmetry  @xcite and spin - density matrix elements  @xcite of @xmath4 production from free protons at high energies ( 2.8 , 4.7 , 9.3 and 20@xmath1440 gev ) .",
    "the results were consistent with @xmath15-channel helicity conservation .",
    "judging from the fact that @xmath16 , one can conclude that the @xmath4 meson is produced predominately by natural - parity pomeron exchange at high energies .    at @xmath17 gev",
    ", the photoproduction of @xmath4 mesons from free protons in the forward direction  @xcite can be mostly described by the pomeron and ( @xmath18 ) exchange in the @xmath6 channel .",
    "a value of 0.2 was found for @xmath13 , which deviates from 0.5 , the limit corresponding to pure natural - parity exchange .",
    "it suggests a nonnegligible contribution of unnatural - parity exchange processes , in contrast to complete dominance of the pomeron exchange at high energies .    in the measurement of coherent @xmath4 production from deuterons  @xcite",
    ", it is reported that @xmath13  clearly becomes close to 0.5 .",
    "this suggests that the dominant unnatural - parity component , isovector @xmath19 exchange , is forbidden in the coupling to the isoscalar deuteron target  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear transparency ratio of @xmath4 photoproduction for deuterons shows a large suppression of incoherent production  @xcite and is consistent with the @xmath20 dependence of the ratio observed for nuclear targets  @xcite .",
    "also , @xmath13  was observed to be slightly larger in incoherent production from deuterons , compared with production from free protons .",
    "it coincides with destructive interference between isovector @xmath19 and isoscalar @xmath21 exchange amplitudes in the @xmath22 reaction  @xcite .",
    "however , there is no observation of a large isospin asymmetry of @xmath4 production from nucleons .",
    "the decrease in the @xmath4-meson yields , scaled as number of nucleons in the production from deuterons , can not be adequately explained in terms of isospin asymmetry .",
    "a narrow bump structure was found around @xmath23 gev in @xmath4-meson production cross sections from nucleons  @xcite and the origin of this structure is not yet understood .",
    "naively , it is speculated to result from the appearance of ( @xmath18 ) exchange near threshold .",
    "however , the measured decay angular distributions , which in principle reflect the relative weights of natural - parity and unnatural - parity processes , do not vary appreciably across the bump region .",
    "this structure can not be described by a conventional model with the pomeron and pseudoscalar exchange , where a monotonic energy dependence is predicted  @xcite .",
    "various theoretical interpretations of this structure are proposed : the interference between unnatural - parity @xmath19 and @xmath21 exchanges  @xcite , the interference of the isovector scalar @xmath24 meson with pomeron exchange  @xcite , the coupled - channel effect of @xmath25 and @xmath26  @xcite , and the existence of @xmath27 resonances with a large @xmath11 component  @xcite . nonetheless , a satisfactory description of the bump structure of @xmath4-meson photoproduction is still lacking .",
    "comprehensive information on spin - density matrix elements will help clarify the situation .",
    "previously , only limited numbers of spin - density matrix elements were determined from one - dimensional decay angular distributions  @xcite .",

    "the physical property of the production mechanism is simplest when illustrated in : the helicity system for @xmath15-channel helicity conservation , the gottfried - jackson system for @xmath6-channel helicity conservation with no absorption , and the adair system for the spin independence in the overall cm system  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the gottfried - jackson system has the advantage that some spin - density matrix elements work as a measure of the asymmetry between processes with natural - parity and unnatural - parity exchanges in the @xmath6 channel  @xcite . in general",

    "for evaluation of the relative contribution of the unnatural - parity exchange at small @xmath44 , one need take into account @xmath45  @xcite as follows : @xmath46    a finite value of the spin - density matrix element @xmath47  comes from the amplitude responsible for the double - spin transitions where the helicity of the @xmath4 meson differs from the photon helicity by two units : @xmath48 . in many theoretical models for @xmath4-meson photoproduction , such as scalar , pseudoscalar @xmath6-channel exchange , and the original donnachie - landshoff pomeron exchange model based on the pomeron - isoscalar photon identity ,",

    "the measurements of the diffractive @xmath4 production at low energies are qualitatively consistent with the description of natural - parity pomeron and unnatural - parity pseudoscalar exchanges in the @xmath6 channel  @xcite .",

    ", the isovector @xmath19 exchange is eliminated , and the natural - parity exchange becomes quite dominant .",
    "this observation reflects the fact that the @xmath21-exchange channel is relatively small .",
    "a slight increase in the contribution for natural - parity exchange is seen in the incoherent production , being consistent with the theoretical prediction , if one takes into account the destructive effect of @xmath19- and @xmath21-exchanges in the @xmath22 reaction  @xcite .    a bump structure in the differential cross section at forward angles",
    "is observed at @xmath116 gev in both the production from free protons and the incoherent production from deuterons .",
    "the origin of this structure should be common for production from both protons and neutrons .",

    "judging from the smallness of @xmath32 except @xmath13  and @xmath40  in the helicity frame , we see that the helicity - nonconserving amplitudes is rather limited for the @xmath15 channel in the very forward direction .",
    "there is also no significant variation in the spin - density matrix elements across the bump region .",
    "therefore we conclude that this bump structure is also unlikely to be caused by any nucleon resonance states containing large @xmath11 content  @xcite unless there are some complicated interference effects .     for @xmath0at @xmath134 gev@xmath87/c@xmath87 in the gottfried - jackson system .",

    "nine spin - density matrix elements representing the angular distributions in the @xmath84  decay mode are obtained simultaneously by the extended maximum likelihood fit in three different coordinate frames .",
    "there is no strong energy dependence observed in the measured energy region , although some @xmath6 dependence is found .",
    "small but finite helicity - nonconserving effects are seen in the @xmath6 channel but they become less significant in the @xmath15 channel .    based on the measurement of @xmath13  and @xmath122 , unnatural - parity exchange processes are no longer negligible near threshold , even though the natural - parity pomeron exchange process still dominates .",
    "the unnatural - parity processes are significantly reduced in the coherent production from deuterium .",
    "this fact can be interpreted to appear as the result of the suppression of isovector @xmath19 exchange .",
    "the averaged contribution of the unnatural - parity processes in incoherent production decreases slightly and could be due to the destructive interference of the ( @xmath18)-exchange processes in production from neutrons .    a theoretical model based on the dominance of the donnachie - landshoff pomeron plus ( @xmath18)-exchange channels  @xcite gives a reasonable prediction at @xmath116 gev but obviously there is room for quantitative improvement .",
    "new and comprehensive information on spin observables available from this work should help to differentiate the theoretical models .",
    "hopefully , this will lead to a better picture of the @xmath4-meson photoproduction at low energies , especially to shed light on whether any exotic channel is necessary to account for the bump structure at @xmath138 gev .",
    "a manifestation of an unnatural - parity exchange component in the photoproduction of @xmath4 mesons near threshold regions was already observed .",
    "new programs at leps and clas aim to perform measurements at @xmath139 gev , and to study double polarization observables with polarized proton and deuterium targets .",
