    "<S> we have developed a conceptually new type of ellipsometry which allows the determination of the complex refractive index by simultaneously measuring the unpolarized normal - incidence reflectivity relative to the vacuum and to another reference media . </S>",
    "<S> from these two quantities the complex optical response can be directly obtained without kramers - kronig transformation . due to its transparency and large refractive index over a broad range of the spectrum , from the far - infrared to the soft ultraviolet region </S>",
    "<S> , diamond can be ideally used as a second reference . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental arrangement is rather simple compared to other ellipsometric techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> determination of the complex dielectric response of a material is an everlasting problem in optical spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the basic optical properties , whether the sample is transparent or has strong absorption in the photon - energy range of interest , its absolute reflectivity or the transmittance is usually detected with normal incidence . </S>",
    "<S> both quantities are related to the intensity of the light and give no information about the phase change during either reflection or transmission . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the phase shift is generally determined by kramers - kronig ( kk ) transformation in order to obtain the complex dielectric response . however , for the proper kk analysis the reflectivity or the transmittance spectrum has to be measured in a broad energy range , ideally over the whole electromagnetic spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , there exist ellipsometric methods @xcite which are capable to simultaneously detect both the intensity and the phase of the light reflected back or transmitted through a media . among them </S>",
    "<S> the most state - of - the - art technique is the time domain spectroscopy but its applicability is mostly restricted to the far infrared region.@xcite an other class of ellipsometric techniques , sufficient for broadband spectroscopy , requires polarization - selective detection of light.@xcite ( in the following we will discuss experimental situations in reflection geometry although most of the considerations are valid for transmission , as well . ) a representative example is the so - called rotating - analyzer ellipsometry ( rae ) when the reflectivity is measured at a finite angle of incidence , usually in the vicinity of the brewster angle.@xcite under this condition the fresnel coefficients are different for polarization parallel ( @xmath0-wave ) and perpendicular ( @xmath1-wave ) to the plane of incidence and the initially linearly polarized light becomes elliptically polarized upon the reflection . by rotating the analyzer the ellipsometric parameters , i.e. the phase difference and the intensity ratio for the @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave components of the reflected light,@xcite are measured and the complex refractive index can be directly obtained . each of the above experimental methods is far more complicated than the measurement of unpolarized reflectivity or transmittance near normal incidence .    as an alternative </S>",
    "<S> , we describe a new type of ellipsometry , hereafter referred to as double - reference spectroscopy ( drs ) . </S>",
    "<S> it offers a simple way to obtain the complex dielectric function without kk transformation by measuring the unpolarized normal - incidence reflectivity of the sample relative to two transparent reference media . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the absolute reflectivity , i.e. that of the vacuum - sample interface , we can take advantage from the excellent optical properties of diamond and use it as a second reference . </S>",
    "<S> high - quality such as type iia optical diamonds are transparent from the far - infrared up to the ultraviolet photon energy region,@xcite except for the multiphonon absorption bands located at @xmath2ev.@xcite moreover , they have a large refractive index @xmath3 which shows only @xmath4 energy dependence up to @xmath5ev.@xcite the significant difference between the refractive index of the two reference media is a crucial point of the method .    </S>",
    "<S> as the experimental arrangement is much simpler than that of any ellipsometric technique , this method may find a much broader application , especially when only a narrow spectral range is of interest ( or when kramers - kronig transformation can not be performed due to experimental limitations ) . </S>",
    "<S> a representative field of application is the class of strongly correlated electron systems when the optical properties are very sensitive to the low energy excitations . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the kk transformation can not reliably differentiate between full- or pseudo - gap behavior or can not even distinguish between bad metals with fully incoherent low - frequency response and semiconductors with small charge gap .    ) and diamond - sample ( @xmath6 ) interfaces as calculated from the dielectric function @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the unit of the energy scales corresponds to the plasma frequency . </S>",
    "<S> gaussian noise with @xmath10 standard deviation is introduced to both @xmath11 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> panel ( c)-(d ) : the refractive index ( @xmath13 ) and the extinction coefficient ( @xmath14 ) as obtained from the above reflectivities using the drs ( closed circles ) and the rae ( open circles ) approach . the complex refractive index free of noise is indicated by full lines.,width=326 ]    in the following , we describe the principles of the double - reference spectroscopy and demonstrate its efficiency in comparison with the rae . </S>",
    "<S> the essence of the method is the measurement of the sample reflectivity relative to two media with strongly different dielectric properties , such as vacuum and diamond . for normal incidence </S>",
    "<S> the fresnel equations for the two interfaces have the following form : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denote the complex index of refraction and @xmath17 is well documented in the literature for type iia diamonds.@xcite although the fresnel equations are highly nonlinear , @xmath18 can easily be expressed in the lack of absorption within the diamond , i.e. for @xmath19 : @xmath20    we show the efficiency of the method using the model dielectric function @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the resonance frequency and the damping of the oscillator , respectively . from @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate both @xmath25 and @xmath12 by the fresnel equations while in case of rae the intensity is calculated for three different orientations of the analyzer.@xcite the resonance frequency is varied in such a way that the reflectivity spectra , plotted in the upper panels of fig .  1 , describe both insulating and metallic behavior , corresponding to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the typical noise of the detection and the finite energy resolution are taken into account as gaussian noise superimposed on the intensities with standard deviation of @xmath10 . furthermore </S>",
    "<S> , systematic errors coming from the imperfect experimental conditions  such as sample surface roughness and non - planarity , misalignment of the light path  are represented as @xmath28 deviation in the angle of incidence for the both cases .    ) and the extinction coefficient ( @xmath29 ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> full lines with labels correspond to the spectra shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1.,width=307 ]    from the given reflectivity spectra the complex refractive index is calculated by the double - reference method using eqs .  1 - 2 and also by following the more complicated evaluation of rae . </S>",
    "<S> the real and imaginary part of the respective @xmath30 spectra are shown in the lower panels of fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> . the exact spectra , @xmath31 , calculated without introducing experimental errors are also shown for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the precision of the two methods seems comparable .    in order to classify the range of applicability , the error maps for the two techniques </S>",
    "<S> are analyzed in more detail over the plane of the complex refractive index . as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows , the overall confidence level of the drs surpass that of the rae , especially in case of the extinction coefficient , @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , while the error map for the real and imaginary part of the refractive index behaves similarly in case of the drs , the rae is optimal for the two components in rather distinct regions of the @xmath32 plane . </S>",
    "<S> although for rae the area of applicability is seemingly more extended for the real part of the refractive index in the limit of @xmath33 , the extinction coefficient dominating the optical response in this strongly - absorbing region exhibits a high error level .    . </S>",
    "<S> reflection from the vacuum - diamond and diamond - sample interfaces are indicated . </S>",
    "<S> multiple reflections within the diamond can be neglected due to the wedging of the window . </S>",
    "<S> this wedging also allows for a clean separation of the reflections from the two interfaces and thus facilitates reference measurements ( see text for details).,width=230 ]    in situations where @xmath34@xmath18@xmath35@xmath36 , such as strong resonances or good metals with large extinction coefficient ( @xmath14@xmath37@xmath13@xmath38@xmath36 ) , the fresnel equations are not numerically independent since the reflection coefficients converge to the unity irrespective of the polarization state of the light , the angle of incidence or the reference media . in this limit , </S>",
    "<S> the both approaches fail which is general for any ellipsometry . for the drs </S>",
    "<S> it means that the difference between the two reference media disappears as @xmath34@xmath18@xmath35@xmath39 . with a realistic noise level specified above </S>",
    "<S> , the drs works with less than @xmath40 error until the refractive indexes are twice as large as that of the diamond , i.e. almost in the whole range of @xmath34@xmath18@xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> it is to be emphasized at this point that the large difference in the refractive index of the two reference media highly extends the applicability range of the method and reduces the numerical errors .    </S>",
    "<S> the unique efficiency of diamond arises from its wide transparency window . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that optically well - characterized semiconductors , such as si,@xcite gaas,@xcite and cdte,@xcite can provide an even better better performance for a limited range of energy , typically below @xmath42ev . </S>",
    "<S> since these materials are popular substrates for crystal growing , drs can be carried out by the successive measurement of the two sides of the samples .    </S>",
    "<S> next we describe a simple procedure for the measurement of @xmath6 applying a wedged diamond piece as sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3.@xcite the intensity reflected back from the vacuum - diamond and diamond - sample interfaces ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively ) can be detected separately by a few degree rotation ; a wedging angle of @xmath45 causes @xmath46 angular deviation between the two reflected beams . </S>",
    "<S> since the nearly normal incidence can still be considered for both positions , the reflectivity of the sample relative to the diamond is obtained from the measured intensities as:@xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is the absolute reflectivity of the diamond . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath50 prefactor can be either calculated from the well - documented refractive index of diamond , @xcite or checked experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> the high - energy limit of this method is mainly determined by the roughness of the diamond - sample interface @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , special care should be taken for the proper matching between the diamond and the sample in order to eliminate interference and diffraction effects inherently appearing for wavelength shorter than @xmath51 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have described a new ellipsometric method whose applicability is demonstrated both for insulating and metallic compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental performance , which is far more simple as compared with other ellipsometric techniques , means the measurement of the normal incidence reflectivity relative to two reference media , e.g. the reflection from the vacuum - sample and diamond - sample interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the double - reference method may find broad application either in the field of broadband optical spectroscopy or in material characterization due to its numerical precision and simplicity . </S>"
