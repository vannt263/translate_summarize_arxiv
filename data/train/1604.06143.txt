    "layer security has attracted significant research attention recently . compared to the traditional upper - layer cryptographic techniques using secret keys , physical layer security safeguards wireless communications by directly exploiting the randomness offered by wireless channels without using secret keys , and thus has been recognized as an alternative for cryptographic techniques @xcite .",
    "the principle of physical layer security was first studied in @xcite assuming single - input single - output systems .",
    "it was shown that secrecy can only exist when the wiretap channel between the source and the eavesdropper is a degraded version of the main channel between the source and the legitimate receiver .",
    "subsequently , this result was generalized to the case where the main channel and the wiretap channel are independent @xcite .    more recently , implementing multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) techniques at the source",
    "/ legitimate receiver has been shown to significantly improve the physical layer security of wiretap channels @xcite . in terms of mimo techniques , beamforming @xcite , artificial noise @xcite , and",
    "transmit antenna selection @xcite are just a few techniques that can be utilized to boost the physical layer security of wiretap channels . in @xcite , it is assumed that the channel state information ( csi ) from the eavesdropper is perfectly or statistically known at the source .",
    "this assumption , however , is unlikely to be valid in practice - especially when the eavesdropper is not an authorized component of the communication system .    in this paper",
    "we propose a location - based beamforming ( lbb ) scheme that does not require the eavesdropper pass her ( instantaneous or statistical ) csi back to the source .",
    "rather , we will assume that some _ a priori _ known location information of the eavesdropper is available at the source .",
    "such a scenario can occur in many circumstances , such as those detailed in @xcite . in our scheme , we assume that _ all _ of the communication channels are in a rician fading environment .",
    "that is , _ all _ the channels can vary from pure line - of - sight ( los ) channel to pure rayleigh channel as the rician @xmath0-factors in the channels change .",
    "we also assume that the csi from the legitimate receiver is _ perfectly _ known at the source , while the _ only _ information on the eavesdropper available at the source is her location .",
    "our key goal is to determine the beamforming vector at the source that minimizes the secrecy outage probability of the system , given the csi of the main channel and the eavesdropper s location .",
    "perhaps the most relevant works to ours are those of @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite , the secrecy outage probability of a lbb scheme in rician wiretap channels was investigated , under the assumptions that the location of the legitimate receiver was available and location of the eavesdropper was available .",
    "different from @xcite , our two assumptions are that the location of the eavesdropper is available and the csi from the legitimate receiver is available .",
    "that is , the assumption set we adopt in this work is different .",
    "based on this latter assumption set , we propose a new lbb scheme that minimizes the secrecy outage probability .",
    "we note that , the new assumption set we adopt will lead to a reduction in the secrecy outage probability ( relative to @xcite ) , but ( more importantly ) will also enable us to determine the optimal beamforming vector at the source in a more efficient manner . in @xcite ,",
    "the secrecy outage probability was examined in rician wiretap channels where the source is equipped with a large number of antennas .",
    "different from @xcite , our proposed scheme applies for an arbitrary number of antennas at the source .",
    "moreover , we introduce a jammer to the system .",
    "our contributions are summarized as follows :    * we derive a simple expression of the secrecy outage probability when the eavesdropper s location and the csi of the main channel are known .",
    "we highlight that our expression is valid for arbitrary values of sinr and rician @xmath0 factors in the main channel and the channel between the source and the eavesdropper . * based on this new expression , we develop a much more efficient search algorithm for the determination of the optimal beamforming scheme that minimizes the secrecy outage probability when the csi of the main channel and the eavesdropper s location are available at the source .",
    "we highlight that our new search algorithm invokes a one - dimensional search , as opposed to the multi - dimensional searches required previously , thereby greatly reducing the computational complexity ( important for in - filed deployment ) . *",
    "we derive an approximate expression of the secrecy outage probability of the system with the jammer for the special case where the rician @xmath0-factor of the jammer - eavesdropper channel is @xmath1 , which provides a computationally efficient way to characterize the secrecy outage probability of the system with the jammer when the jammer - eavesdropper channel is in a pure rayleigh fading environment .",
    "* we examine the impact of location uncertainty on the secrecy outage probability , showing how secrecy can still exist when only a noisy estimate of the eavesdropper s location is available at the source .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the system model considered in the paper . in section iii , we detail the proposed lbb scheme in rician wiretap channels without the jammer . in section iv , we examine the proposed lbb scheme in rician wiretap channels with the jammer . numerical results and related discussions",
