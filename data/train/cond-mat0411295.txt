    "complex network theory has flourished as an effort to explain the main characteristics of discrete interacting systems .",
    "the first studies were able to describe and explain their topology by showing that different thermodynamical quantities are needed to characterize a particular network , such as its degree distribution @xcite , community structures @xcite , resilience @xcite and motifs @xcite .",
    "recent efforts have also studied quantities spreading on complex networks , such as computer viruses @xcite in technological networks and information in their social counterpart @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , state dynamics has been studied disguised as opinion formation processes , which have been modelled using approaches including cellular automata @xcite , spin chains @xcite and opinion drifts over a continuous opinion space @xcite , without incorporating topology .",
    "recently , network topology has become more relevant and computer simulations have been performed in this direction @xcite , though a systematic way to evaluate the topological effects on the dynamical processes taking place on networks is still missing .",
    "+ in this paper we study the effects of topology on a copy mechanism taking place over a network with a non - trivial topology and an arbitrary number of states . to achieve this , we group agents with similar topological characteristics and study the density of the evolving quantities over these groups by considering the interactions among them .",
    "+ we will first introduce the model together with its associated notation and then solve it analytically .",
    "we will then study how network topology affects the simple dynamical process introduced below and show that the system arrives to a configuration in which the distribution of states is independent of the degree .",
    "we consider a process in which at each time step an agent changes its state by copying one randomly from one of its immediate neighbors .",
    "the probability that this occurs is the product between the probability that the agent is chosen , times the fraction of neighbors in a given state , including the agent , that are acquainted by it .",
    "we will consider a directed network with an adjustable topology as the substrate in which these dynamical processes will occur , and attempt to characterize the influence of topology upon them .",
    "we assume that changes in the network topology take place at larger timescales than the relaxation times of the system .",
    "+      we begin by grouping agents according to their degree into aggregates we call _",
    "guilds_. this reduces the problem to one as big as the number of guilds used to calculate the approximation , this depends on the desired degree resolution , but it is always considerable smaller than the number of agents .",
    "agents in a specific guild can be in any of the available _",
    "states_. we introduce the density @xmath0 as the number of agents in the @xmath1 guild which pertain to the @xmath2 state , over the number of agents in the network .",
    "we define _ guild size _ @xmath3 as the fraction of agents constituting that guild and _ fractional abundance _ as the fraction of agents on a particular state in the entire network @xmath4 . from now on",
    ", latin indices will refer to guilds , while greek indices will label states .",
    "+ we assume that the linking patterns of agents in the same guild are similar . in other words , we will model a network in which agents from the same guild are linked to a similar number of agents in other guilds , although not necessarily the same .",
    "this motivates us to introduce @xmath5 as the probability that an agent in the @xmath1 guild is linked to an agent in the @xmath6 guild .",
    "we will refer to these quantities as _ linking probabilities _ and say that someone is linked to someone else if the linking agent has a _ personal _ or _ media _ based knowledge of the linked one .",

    "nodes carry guilds as its labels , the first guild has 5 agents with a degree equal to 2 .",

    "three equal size guilds are clearly distinguishable and acquaintanceship probabilities are given by @xmath7      in the large network limit the rate of change for a state in a given guild is equal to the difference between the probabilities of wining and losing an agent .",
    "the probability that an agent in the @xmath1 guild turns into the @xmath8 state is @xmath9 while the probability that an agent in the @xmath1 guild and the @xmath8 state changes its state to a diffrenet one is @xmath10 we simplify the notation introducing @xmath11 as the matrix representing the expected fraction of agents in a particular state known by an agent in a particular guild on the entire network , + @xmath12 combining eqns .",

    "( [ master ] ) .",
    "time units represent the network s natural update time , which is the number of time steps equal to the population size in a random or sequential updating processes .",
    "+      an analytical solution can be obtained by re - writing eqn .",
    "( [ master ] ) and performing the substitution @xmath15 .",
    "this transforms eqn .",
    "( [ master ] ) into an eigenvalue equation for the vector @xmath16 .",
    "the problem then reduces to finding the solution of @xmath17 where @xmath18 . from eqn .",
    "( [ eigenmaster ] ) it follows that the eigenfunctions of @xmath19 depend exponentially on time with a decay rate @xmath20 , where @xmath20 is the associated eigenvalue , this agrees with the results presented in @xcite .",
    "a general solution can be written in terms of this basis as @xmath21 in which @xmath22 is the @xmath1 element of the @xmath23 eigenvector of the matrix @xmath19 and @xmath24 is its associated eigenvalue .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath19 does not depend on the state , implying that the state dependence is introduced through the initial conditions only , represented by @xmath25 .",
    "+      the steady states are characterized by the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue @xmath26 . by direct calculation",
    "one can show that @xmath19 always has an eigenvalue equal to 1 associated with guild sizes as its eigenvector .",
    "one has @xmath27 we have observed numerically that the remaining eigenvalues have a real part smaller than 1 and lie inside the unit circle of the complex plane , a formal demonstration of this remains open .",
    "+ the mean - field approach presented above was compared with a stochastic simulation on a 1000 agents network in which two equal size guilds were distinguishable ( fig .",
    "( [ stoch ] ) ) .",
    "the acquaintanceship probabilities were chosen such that all agents acquainted everyone in their respective guild , while the ones in the first guild acquainted an average of 3/5 of the agents in the second guild .",
    "on the contrary , agents in the second guild acquainted 1/5 of the agents in the first one .",

    "error bars indicate one standard deviation . in each simulation",
    "the network was chosen randomly constrained to satisfy the conditions presented in the text.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "we define the @xmath28 degree of an agent pertaining to a specific guild as the fraction of agents in the total sample that it knows .",
    "it , therefore represents the fraction of the network exerting a direct influence on it . on the other hand ,",
    "an agent s @xmath29 degree is the fraction of the entire network that knows the agent , these are the ones directly influenced by it .",
    "this definition of degree implies that peer influence flows opposite to acquaintanceship . according to this ,",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath29 degree s in our model are represented by @xmath30 thus degree distribution can be imposed by considering that the fraction of agents with the described degree is equal to guild size @xmath31 .",
    "we can approach a complex network with an _ out _ degree distribution satisfying a function @xmath32 by the solutions of @xmath33 in the case of scale - free networks eqn .",
    "( [ forcenet ] ) becomes @xmath34 where constant factors like normalization or network size have been absorbed by the elements of @xmath35 , noting that equation ( [ master ] ) is zero degree homogeneous in @xmath35 .",
    "for the case of a random network , degree distribution has an exponential tail that can be approximated by the solutions of @xmath36 as parameters . here",
    "@xmath37 characterizes the rate of exponential decay and @xmath38 is a normalization factor .",
    "to capture the influence exerted by the topology on the dynamical process , we define _ guild influence _ @xmath39 as the equilibrium fractional abundance that a state will achieve assuming that it was initially occupying , only and entirely , the @xmath1 guild ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 this quantity represents the average number of copies that an agent of a given guild creates during the entire process , or an effective infection rate proper of the guild .",

    "( b)influence structure of a random network against the inverse of its characteristic length @xmath37 , for a 10 guild network . from top to bottom guild sizes were chosen as 0.026 , 0.032 , 0.041 , 0.053 , 0.068 , 0.088 , 0.114 , 0.147 , 0.189 and 0.245 .",

    "different lines represent linearly spaced variations of the constant @xmath48 in the 0.01 - 0.09 interval from lowest to highest slope respectively .",

    "( [ sfeq ] ) . figure ( [ sf]a )",
    "shows that the influence of the highest degree guild increases with decreasing @xmath42 , until it reaches a steady value which is equal to the ratio between the system size and the number of agents in the highest degree guild . this is a consequence of the increasing fame of the highest degree guild that occurs for small values of @xmath42 . in the large exponent limit",
    "the influence of all guilds approach unity , meaning that there are no high _ out _ degree agents exerting an important influence on the system .",
    "+      an example involving a exponential network approximated by 10 guilds is shown in fig .",
    "( [ sf]b ) , the procedure used to determine the parameters being analogous to the one performed for the scale - free network .",
    "the figure shows that in a random network high degree guilds exert a mild influence compared to that occurring on its scale - free counterpart .",
    "this is a consequence of the reduced population of high degree guilds .",
    "+      the topological influence of clustering was studied by choosing acquaintanceship probabilities as @xmath50 and equal guild sizes for all the network , where @xmath51 is the kronecker delta .",
    "this model represents a random network in which agents of the @xmath1 guild have a probability @xmath48 of being acquainted to agents in other guilds . as usual",
    ", we shall call this connectivity . on the contrary ,",
    "the probability @xmath52 to acquaint someone from its own guild together with the condition @xmath53 defines clustered groups with an internal connectivity that increases linearly throughout the network .",
    "this is similar to communities in the sense introduced by newman and girvan@xcite and are also similar to the networks studied by watts@xcite at the end of last century .",
    "a particular case of this networks is the one shown in figure ( [ explain ] ) .",
    "+ in a random network , clustering is equal to the probability that two agents are acquainted , motivating us to define guild clustering as the clustering coefficient of a guild in the absence of the rest of the network .",
    "we studied the dependence of influence on guild clustering ( fig .",
    "( [ sf]c ) ) finding that there is a linear dependence with a slope that decreases with @xmath48 , meaning that the reinforcement mechanism is more effective in sparsely connected networks than in strongly connected ones .",
    "either way , the effect continues to remain mild compared to its scale - free counterpart . on the other hand , the characteristic time @xmath54 required for the system to converge increases with decreasing @xmath48 as @xmath55 with @xmath56 ( see fig .",
    "using the formalism recently introduced we can also find how states are distributed when the network reaches equilibria . in order to do this",
    ", first we notice that eqn.([master ] ) vanishes when @xmath57 if we multiply eqn .",
    "( [ master ] ) by @xmath58 and add over all @xmath59 we will find a rate eqn . for @xmath60 .",
    "this , must vanish in equilibria implying that @xmath61 the term on the righthand side does not depend on @xmath59 so the summation just yields the number of guilds we have chosen to approximate the system .",
    "considering a system with @xmath62 guilds leads us to conclude that ( [ condition2 ] ) is the same as @xmath63 the lefthand side of this equality does not depend on @xmath64 , so when the system reaches the steady state , the ratio between @xmath65 must be the same for every guild . combining this with condition ( [ condition1 ] )",
    "we conclude that upon equilibria the system reaches a configuration in which the ratio between the number of agents in a certain state over the total number of agents is independent of the degree , thus each guild has exactly the same distribution of states as the entire network .",
    "the formalism presented above can be used to understand some topological characteristics of the studied network .",
    "recently , two groups have presented works indicating that a simple dynamical process like the one studied in this paper can be solved , in the case in which two states are involved , by the use of conserved quantities or martingales @xcite .",
    "the first of them proposes that a weighted average over degree should be conserved in a dynamical process of this kind . in our formalism",
    "we average the fraction of agents in each state weighted by their relative degree as @xmath66 we can shows that this is a conserved quantity by taking eqn .",
    "( [ master ] ) , multiply it by @xmath58 and add it over @xmath59 , @xmath64 and @xmath2 to get , @xmath67 performing the summation over @xmath2 on the first term and over @xmath68 in the second term and cancelling the @xmath69 we get .",
    "@xmath70 which is clearly equal to zero .",
    "this quantity is naturally conserved if we consider that @xmath71 represents the fraction of agents in the @xmath2 state that are known by someone on the the @xmath72 guild .",
    "thus @xmath69 represents the total numbers of agents know by the @xmath72 guild , and @xmath11 therefore represents the fraction of agents known by all the guilds combined , or in the other words the number of non - intersecting sub - graphs of the network that are able to reach all the nodes of it . + in a two state system in which each one of them is represented by a spin up or down we can show that the degree averaged magnetization does not depend on time by replacing the fraction of agents in a certain state by the fraction of agents in that state times its spin .",
    "@xmath73 if we span @xmath71 we can show that the change on this quantity can be constructed by using our formalism as @xmath74 where the two added terms are strictly equal if we consider that @xmath68 and @xmath2 are mute variables .",
    "this agrees with the results found by wu et .",
    "al . @xcite and can be extended to an arbitrary number of spins . which in this case are nothing more than labels , and we believe its _ names _ should not enter the calculations .",
    "using a topologically considerate mean - field approach we were able to characterize the simple dynamics of a node updating mechanism on a complex network with an arbitrary degree distribution .",
    "+ the main idea behind this technique was to group nodes with similar topological characteristics into aggregates we called guilds .",
    "we characterized the reproductive capability of guilds by a quantity we called influence and showed that in the case of a scale - free network the system bias dramatically towards the states pertaining to the highest degree guilds as the characteristic exponent decrease , while on an exponential network this effect is comparatively mild . + it was also shown that the convergence time scale as a function of connectivity , with a characteristic exponent close to 1 , when we considered a network formed by mildly connected clusters .",
    "this is a consequence of the reinforcement mechanism introduced by the node updating rule .",
    "we were also able to show that clustered groups tend to be more influential than un - clustered ones .",
    "this is due to the fact that they are harder to invade , allowing them to act over the system for a longer period of time .",
    "+ the final configuration of the system was unravelled , showing that it arrives to a stationary distribution in which the fraction of nodes with a certain degree that are in a certain state , over the total number of nodes with that degree , is independent of the particular degree and it therefore mimics the network . + in the last section we discussed a purely topological quantity , which is naturally conserved and represents the number of subgraphs present in the network with the ability to held it together .",
    "this suggests a direct link with network resilience and will be present in future discussions .",
