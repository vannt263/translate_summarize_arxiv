    "observed @xmath0 distributions for @xmath17 in @xmath54 and @xmath16 collisions are well described by the formula ( [ eq.dif5 ] ) , and the result of fitting in @xmath16 collisions becomes much better as the centrality cut increases .",
    "the result on transverse momentum distributions for @xmath18 in @xmath16 collisions are not good as those for @xmath17 . however , as the centrality cut increases , the result becomes much improved .",
    "this tendency would suggest that the initial condition ( [ eq.dif2 ] ) is simpler for the heavy ion collision process . at the lower centrality cut ,",
    "collisions among projectile and target particles occur much more times compared with those at higher centrality cut .",
    "therefore , secondary particles produced at each collision may have a certain ( collective ) velocity distribution wider than the delta function ( [ eq.dif5 ] ) even in the initial stage . in order to include the effect",
