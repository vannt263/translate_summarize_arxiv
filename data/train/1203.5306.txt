    "the problem is compounded by the fact that we wish to work close to the detection limits of the sdss photometry , where errors on flux measurements cause objects to scatter substantially in colour space , and that the boss key science programs did not include the study of the clustering of @xmath32 quasars .",

    "one of the main goals of studying quasar clustering is to provide information on the parent dark matter halos hosting luminous quasars .",

    "in particular , because the halo mass function is much steeper than the galaxy stellar mass function , the typical stellar mass of a central galaxy drops steeply with decreasing halo mass  another way of stating that galaxy formation is inefficient in low mass halos . if black - hole properties are set by the galactic potential rather than by halo properties we expect curvature in the @xmath86 relation , which impacts how we interpret the duty cycle or the active quasar fraction .",
    "another possibility is that the instantaneous luminosity of the quasar is drawn from a lognormal distribution with central value proportional to a power of the halo mass ( or circular velocity ) or the central galaxy mass ( or dispersion ) .",
    "physically such a model would arise if quasars radiate with a small range of eddington ratios and are powered by black holes whose masses are tightly correlated with the mass or circular velocity of the galaxy or host halo ( through e.g.  black - hole bulge , bulge galaxy and galaxy halo correlations ) .",

    "we generate a mock catalog drawn from the halos of the simulations introduced in  [ sec : lognormal ] .",
    "we impose the duty cycle by randomly subsampling the possible quasars to ensure the distribution matches the observed luminosity function and then impose the magnitude limits to match the observed sample .",
    "we compute @xmath51 and fit for @xmath66 as described previously .",
    "[ fig : duty ] shows the duty cycle for the best - fit model with @xmath102 .",
    "the duty cycle peaks near one per cent at @xmath103 , corresponding to @xmath104 or black hole masses of @xmath105 .",
    "this is near the center of our magnitude range and in our model corresponds to halos of several times @xmath106 or @xmath107 .",
    "converting the duty cycle into an activity time is somewhat ill defined .",
    "if we assume @xmath108 , with @xmath109 the hubble time , we find @xmath110yr .",
    "these activity times are broadly consistent with those derived at @xmath111 , though since the hubble time is significantly shorter the duty cycles are significantly higher .",
    "also , note the luminosity / halo mass dependence of the duty cycle , which implies that in this model we need extra physics to describe the lf beyond simply major mergers with a fixed light - curve .",
    "a second option is to tie the black - hole properties to the host galaxy , relating the galaxy properties to those of the halo by abundance matching . for the stellar masses and dispersions of interest here",
    "the velocity dispersion of the galaxy is proportional to the galaxy circular velocity , and we can take the black - hole mass to scale as the @xmath112 power of either quantity ( as in the local universe ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "[ fig : duty ] shows that in this model the low luminosity slope of the luminosity function is in good agreement with the observations or the duty cycle has little luminosity dependence  much of the suppression of low luminosity quasars can be accomplished by the same physics as is invoked to suppress star formation in lower mass galaxies .",
    "this cut - off in the occupancy to low halo masses tends to flatten the run of bias with luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bias_vs_mi ] ) in a manner similar to luminosity dependent lifetime models , where there are also very few quasars in low mass halos .    at the high luminosity",
    "end the suppression could be due to increasing inefficiency in feeding a black hole as cold - mode accretion becomes less effective ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or the fact that it is harder to have a major galaxy merger ( which would simultaneously drive gas to the center and deepen the potential , allowing luminous quasar activity ) when the stellar mass is increasing slowly with halo mass or due to curvature in the @xmath75 relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "while the agreement is by no means perfect , the general trends are in quite good agreement with observations , i.e.  the luminosity dependence of the duty cycle is relatively weak .    the determining factors for the flatness of the bias - luminosity relation ( fig .  [ fig : bias_vs_mi ] )",
    "is the slope of the halo mass observable ( i.e.  luminosity ) relation and the degree of scatter in that relation .",
    "for very high clustering amplitudes ( as measured at high @xmath52 ) one obtains an upper limit on the scatter , which can be quite constraining for models , but at intermediate @xmath52 quite a large degree of scatter is allowed @xcite .",
    "the scatter can arise from a number of sources including luminosity dependent lifetime , but also stochasticity in the relations between halo mass and galaxy mass , galaxy mass and central potential well depth , potential well depth and black hole mass , black hole mass and optical luminosity . for reasonable values of halo - observable slope , luminosity bin width and stochasticity ,",
    "one obtains quite flat @xmath115  whether or not there is a sharp cut - off in the halo mass distribution .",
    "thus while it is definitely plausible that quasar lifetime is luminosity dependent , it is not strictly required by the current clustering data at these redshifts .",

    "if quasar luminosity is additionally affected by the inefficiency of galaxy formation in lower mass halos , we expect to see a luminosity dependent quasar bias primarily at higher luminosities ( and redshifts ) .",

    "we select all halos at @xmath70 which are central subhalos of halos which lie within an octave ( i.e.  factor of 2 ) in mass centered on @xmath59 ( @xmath120 particles ) .",
    "essentially all of these halos are the most massive in their local environment .",
    "one quarter of the hosts fall into a large halo ( becoming a satellite ) and then lose more than 99.9 per cent of their mass ( falling below the resolution limit of the simulation ) without merging with the central galaxy or another satellite subhalo . to the extent that this process is well resolved , the stars in any galaxies hosted by these subhalos would likely contribute to an intra - halo light component , while the black holes would form a freely floating component or be associated with highly stripped satellites . of the remaining 75 per cent of the subhalos ,",
    "three quarters are the most massive progenitor in all their subsequent mergers and remain central galaxies to @xmath91 .",

    "this wide diversity of outcomes is reminiscent of the varied fates of @xmath119 star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as constraints on the stellar masses of galaxies within halos become tighter , comparison of the stellar masses of quasar hosts with that of their @xmath125 descendants will put constraints on the star - formation history of these objects .",
    "the evolution of clustering with time can place strong constraints on how episodic quasar activity can be . as emphasized by @xcite ,",
    "if the typical host of quasars does not evolve significantly with redshift then quasars can not be repeated bursts of the same black hole because such black holes would live in halos which grow in mass as the universe evolves .",
    "however the quantitative strength of this statement , and the allowed fraction of objects which could burst more than once , is difficult to assess .",
    "one issue is the size of the observational errors , the other is that higher redshift samples typically probe more massive black holes than lower redshift samples ( as emphasized e.g.  by * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the highest redshift clustering measurement comes from @xcite , at @xmath126 .",
    "their result is consistent with host halos of @xmath127 .",
    "such hosts would grow in mass by a factor of approximately 4 between @xmath128 and 2.4 . similarly , the progenitors of our @xmath59 , @xmath70 halos are approximately 4 times less massive at @xmath128 .",
    "this suggests on average an order of magnitude mismatch in halo masses , but with a large error .",
    "assuming no evolution in eddington ratio between @xmath128 and @xmath70 the quasars in the @xcite sample are a factor of about 5 brighter than the boss quasars .",
    "if the power - law index of the @xmath86 relation is close to unity there is little tension from clustering in assuming quasars episodically burst .",
    "the time span between @xmath128 and @xmath70 in our adopted cosmology is @xmath73gyr .",
    "the universe is another @xmath73gyr older at @xmath129 .",
    "taking @xmath66 at @xmath130 from @xcite and converting it to a host halo mass we obtain @xmath131 .",
    "the descendants of our @xmath59 , @xmath70 halos are approximately twice as massive at @xmath132 , again leading to little tension in a model with episodic outbursts .",
    "we can see the issues most clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : prevwork ] .",
    "if halos moved with the same large - scale velocities as the dark matter and never merged the decrease of their bias would approximately cancel the increased clustering of the matter ( @xcite ; see fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "for a highly biased sample such passive evolution corresponds to almost constant clustering strength , for slightly less - biased objects the clustering strength grows slowly with time .",
    "this result is shown as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : prevwork ] , corresponding to objects with @xmath133 .",
    "merging of halos and including a finite range of halo masses alters the details of this evolution , but keeps the sense unaltered .",
    "by contrast , halos of a fixed mass predict a clustering strength which drops slowly with time  shown as the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : prevwork ] for halos of @xmath59 .",
    "again , a more realistic scenario with a finite range of halo masses has the same sense of the evolution .",
    "the current data are not in strong conflict with either scenario .",
    "if a random fraction of quasars repeats at later epochs while new quasars always appear in halos of a fixed mass , the measured clustering resembles a sample with bias @xmath134 .",
    "the measured values of @xmath66 are consistent with being roughly constant over @xmath135 .",
    "for this reason it is difficult to put a strong upper limit on the fraction of quasars that turn on more than once or the maximum number of times a given quasar can burst .",
    "we have performed real- and redshift - space clustering measurements of a uniform subsample of quasars observed by the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) .",
    "these quasars lie in the redshift range @xmath0 where there has previously been a gap in coverage due to the fact that the quasar and stellar loci cross and the difficulty in targeting quasars in large numbers to faint fluxes .",
    "we detect clustering at high significance in both real- and redshift - space for the entire sample and subsamples split by redshift and luminosity ( see table [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "we do not detect a luminosity or redshift dependence of the clustering strength , although our sensitivity to this dependence is weak due to the limited dynamic range in both variables in our sample .",
    "the two - point correlation functions are consistent with power - laws over the range of scales measured , with an underlying real - space clustering of the form @xmath136 .",
    "the correlation length , @xmath66 , does not appear to evolve strongly over the redshift range @xmath137 to @xmath138 .",
    "this result is consistent with passive evolution of a highly biased population , although this interpretation is by no means unique .",
    "our results are consistent with quasars living in halos of typical mass @xmath106 at @xmath92 , in line with expectations from earlier surveys .",
    "the measured bias and space density of quasars can be used to infer their duty cycle @xcite . for our best - fit models the duty cycle peaks at one per cent , implying an activity time of @xmath139 years .",
    "this time is comparable to the activity times inferred for quasars at lower redshift , although the hubble time at @xmath70 is shorter than at lower @xmath52 and hence the active fraction is larger .",
    "the typical host halo mass is similar to the inferred hosts of submillimetre galaxies and is more massive than the inferred hosts of typical star - forming galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "this interpretation is in turn consistent with an evolutionary picture in which a massive starburst creates a submillimetre galaxy and is quenched by the formation of a bright quasar . while the typical descendant of the halos that host boss quasars is likely to host a luminous , elliptical galaxy at the present time , we find a wide diversity in descendants in n - body simulations .    using abundance matching to infer the properties of quasar host galaxies we find evidence for evolution in the @xmath75 relation in the sense that black holes must be @xmath140 more massive at fixed galaxy mass at @xmath70 than at @xmath121 .",
    "we find that the predictions for how quasar activity and clustering ( bias ) depend on luminosity differ depending on whether we take as our fundamental relationship a black hole - halo correlation or a black hole - galaxy correlation .",
    "this is because the efficiency of galaxy formation is strongly ( halo ) mass dependent for the halos of interest at these redshifts , leading to strong curvature in the @xmath141 relation . in either scenario",
    "a modest scatter between halo or galaxy mass and observed quasar luminosity ( arising , for example , from a combination of scatters in the black - hole bulge , bulge galaxy and galaxy halo correlations and the eddington ratio ) leads to a shallow dependence of clustering on quasar luminosity , as observed .",
    "future surveys of quasars which probe different regions of the luminosity  redshift plane will inform models of quasar formation and evolution . in this regard boss",
    "continues to measure quasar redshifts , and we expect the number of quasars in the luminosity and redshift range discussed here will be more than doubled by the end of the survey",
    ". it may be possible to incorporate the additional , bonus quasars through cross - correlation or to cross - correlate spectroscopic and photometric quasar samples to better allow us to break the sample by luminosity , spectral or radio properties .",

    "emission lines , such as mgii which are good redshift indicators and which can be used at lower redshift , have redshifted into a relatively noisy part of the spectrum or off of the device altogether .",
    "one hour integrations on a @xmath143 m telescope make it difficult to measure redshifts for quasars with weak lines .",
    "the boss pipeline measures quasar redshifts by fitting their spectra to a set of pca templates @xcite plus a cubic polynomial to allow for changes in continuum slope .",

    "a comparison of redshifts determined from different lines @xcite , and visual inspections , suggests the automatic redshifts are good to @xmath148 . at @xmath149",
    "this corresponds to an error in the line - of - sight distance of roughly @xmath150mpc ( comoving ) , which is significant compared to the correlation length of quasar clustering .",
    "we are attempting to improve our quasar redshift determination , but for now we simply account for the residual line - of - sight smearing induced by redshift errors in our fitting .",
    "in the limit @xmath151 the redshift - space halo correlation function is approximately isotropic and a power - law .",
    "if the redshift errors on quasars are uncorrelated and gaussian distributed with fixed amplitude @xmath152 the observed correlation function is @xmath153 where @xmath154 .",

    "as expected , the agreement is excellent . in this test",
    "the redshift errors were all drawn from a gaussian of the same dispersion . in the observational sample",
    "we might reasonably expect the errors to depend on the properties of each quasar .",
    "in this situation we should interpret @xmath77 as a pair - weighted , `` effective '' , redshift error .",
    "the above tests , plus the clustering measurements themselves , are consistent with a per quasar redshift error corresponding to @xmath150mpc , and we use that as our fiducial value throughout .",
    "models of the quasar phenomenon come in several basic flavors , but are in fact all quite similar .",
    "the majority of models assume that quasar activity occurs due to the major merger of two gas - rich galaxies , since this scenario provides the rapid and violent event needed to funnel fuel to the center of the galaxy ( e.g.  via the bars - within - bars instability * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and feed the central engine while at the same time giving a connection between black hole fueling and the growth of a spheroidal stellar component . if black hole growth is feedback limited , it is only a rapidly growing potential well that can host a rapidly accreting hole .",
    "a notable exception is the models of @xcite which postulate the fuel is funneled to the center by thermal instabilities , which provide the rapid growth of the spheroidal component necessary for black hole growth . as we shall see , both sets of models can predict very similar halo occupancy .    some models implement the physics directly in numerical simulations which attempt to track the hydrodynamics of the gas , with subgrid models for quasar and star formation and the associated feedback @xcite .",
    "other models work at the level of dark matter halos , but follow the same physics  in simplified form  semi - analytically @xcite .",
    "even more idealized are models which are built upon dark matter halos but use scaling relations or convenient functional forms to relate the quasar properties to those of their host halos @xcite .",
    "a final level of abstraction is to simply provide a stochastic recipe for populating dark matter halos with quasars which is tuned to reproduce the observations as best as possible while not attempting to follow the underlying physics @xcite .",
    "the modeling is simplified by several facts .",
    "quasars are rare , their activity times are short and the fraction of binary quasars is small @xcite . the hydrodynamic and semi - analytic models tend to reproduce the observed , @xmath91 relation between black hole mass and halo , which is used as input to the scaling models .",
    "the models agree on the level of scatter in the relation ( roughly a factor of two ) and in broad brush on the evolution in the amplitude and slope of this relation with redshift .",
    "some models invoke quasar feedback limited accretion explicitly while others achieve the same scaling relations without such a limit  e.g .",
    ", by coupling the mechanisms by which bulges and black holes grow . at these masses and",
    "redshifts the satellite galaxy fraction is tiny , so the halo to stellar mass relation is set by abundance matching and any model which reproduces the galaxy stellar mass function will reproduce this relation . at high redshift",
    "bright quasars radiate near eddington , so the models predict similar halo occupancies .",
    "the probability that a halo will undergo a major merger in a short redshift interval is only weakly dependent on the mass of the halo @xcite , i.e.  the mass function of such halos is almost proportional to the mass function of the parent population .",
    "similarly the clustering properties of recently merged halos are similar to a random sample of the population with the same mass distribution @xcite .",
    "thus in any interval , @xmath157 , the fraction of halos of mass @xmath158 which undergo a quasar event is almost independent of @xmath158 and @xmath52 and can be regarded as a random selection .",
    "this makes it difficult to infer that quasars arise from mergers simply from their large - scale clustering , but also implies that for the purposes of modeling the 1- and 2-point functions of the quasar population it is sufficient to specify the halo occupation of the parent population ( more complex models may be needed if correlations between quasars and properties of e.g.  galaxies were required ) .    to determine whether a quasar candidate makes it into any sample it is necessary to relate the observed luminosity to the peak luminosity which is determined by @xmath88",
    "this is done either by specifying a light curve ( e.g.  a power - law , a power - law with a varying slope or an exponential ) or directly @xmath159 using the fact that the triggering rate is understood . for constant triggering rate",
    "a light curve @xmath160 implies @xmath161 , so a wide range of @xmath162 maps to a narrow range in @xmath163 index .",
    "for the high luminosity thresholds we only see objects very near their peak brightness . taking into account the factor @xmath164 scatter in @xmath88 at fixed bulge mass , we expect @xmath159 to be roughly lognormal with a similar width ( it can be slightly broader due to variation in the eddington ratio at peak ) .",
    "as we probe lower luminosities we are more likely to see older , more massive black holes leading to a low @xmath67 tail in @xmath159 and more lower - eddington - ratio objects @xcite . unless we cut off the probability that a halo hosts a quasar at low and high halo mass",
    ", we will overproduce low and high @xmath67 sources @xcite . in the physical models",
    "these limits occur due to lack of fuel in low mass halos and the inability of gas to cool in high - mass halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : scaling ] , models which match the @xmath165 relation for galaxies tend to roughly match the required quasar suppression .",
    "we are interested in the probability that a given halo hosts a quasar in our sample , e.g.  @xmath166 . from the arguments above we expect this relation to be an approximately lognormal function which is asymmetric towards high @xmath158 at low @xmath67 .",
    "it is quite difficult to put constraints on the detailed form of this function using luminosity function and clustering measurements .",
    "we argued above that the steepness of the halo mass function and the high bias of quasars implies that the quasar satellite fraction is small .",
    "the luminosity function thus provides a constraint on the duty cycle .",
    "( this extra degree of freedom reduces the ability of large - scale structure measurements to constrain the halo occupancy , compared to modeling galaxies . )",
    "the steeply falling mass function also implies that the number of quasars hosted in very massive halos is small regardless of the occupancy statistics of such halos . on scales larger than the virial radius of the typical quasar host halo ( i.e.  @xmath167kpc )",
    "the 2-point function is dominated by pairs of quasars in different halos , and thus primarily measures the quasar - weighted halo bias which allows us to infer the mean , quasar - weighted halo mass .",
    "this result remains true for cross - correlation studies too , provided we work on scales larger than the virial radius of the quasar hosts . on smaller scales the amplitude and slope of the correlation function allow us to measure a combination of the satellite fraction of quasars and the low mass cutoff .",
