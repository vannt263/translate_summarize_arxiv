    "the results are clustered in a relatively narrow range of @xmath15 g @xcite .",
    "since the cyclotron resonant scattering occurs near the pulsar surface , the resonance energies were believed to be constant and intrinsic to each pulsar .",
    "however , an unexpected crsf energy change was found from the recurrent transient pulsar 4u  0115 + 63 with the _ ginga _ observations performed in 1990 and 1991 @xcite ; in the 1991 minor outburst when the luminosity was @xmath16 of that in the 1990 and other typical outbursts of this object , the value of @xmath9 was @xmath17 times higher than the so far reported @xmath9@xmath18 kev . in order to interpret the change in @xmath9 , mihara et al .",
    "( 2004 ) proposed that the height of cyclotron scattering region in the accretion column changes depending on the x - ray luminosity .",
    "a further study of the luminosity - dependent crsfs change was conducted by nakajima ( 2006 ) , nakajima et al .",

    "in addition , the second harmonics observed at @xmath22 kev disappeared as @xmath9 started to change .    this luminosity - dependent change in the crsf energy has been found from another source , x0331 + 53 ( v0332 + 53 ) , with _ ginga _ , _ integral _ and _ rxte _ observations ( mihara et al .  1998 ; mowlavi et al .  2006",

    "furthermore , its two higher harmonics have been discovered at energies of @xmath24 and @xmath25 kev @xcite .",
    "thus , x0331 + 53 is the second object which has three or more crsfs in the spectrum , following 4u  0115 + 63 @xcite .",
    "however , compared with the results from 4u  0115 + 63 , this object exhibited two intriguing differences ( mowlavi et al .",
    "2006 ; nakajima 2006 ; tsygankov et al .  2006 , 2009 ) .",
    "one is that the change in @xmath9 started at a higher luminosity , @xmath26 erg s@xmath3 , at an assumed distance of 7 kpc @xcite .",
    "the other is that the second harmonic absorption feature persisted in the x - ray spectra through an outburst .",
    "including the above cases of 4u  0115 + 63 and x0331 + 53 , the behavior of the fundamental crsf has been extensively studied so far . in contrast , details of the second harmonic , including its possible luminosity dependence , are less understood , primarily because of lower data quality at higher energies . with this in mind , we analyzed the whole _",
    "( asm , pca and hexte ) data of x0331 + 53 , acquired in a 2004 - 2005 outburst . as a result , we have discovered that the second crsf energy @xmath27 possibly depends more weakly on the luminosity than @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath27/@xmath9 ratio was @xmath8 when the source was luminous , while it approached the nominal value of 2.0 toward lower luminosities .",
    "these results suggest that the two resonances take place at different heights in the same accretion columns , and that @xmath27 , formed at a lower height , provides a more reliable estimate of the surface field strength .",
    "in order to study the luminosity - dependent changes of @xmath9 and @xmath27 of x0331 + 53 , here we utilized all the _ rxte _ data sets of this transient pulsar acquired in the 2004 - 2005 outburst .",

    "at the outburst peak , a number of target - of - opportunity observations were performed by _ integral _ , _",
    "swift _ , and _ rxte_.    from 2004 november 27 through 2005 march 27 , 108 pointing observations were made with the proportional counter array ( pca ; jahoda et al .",

    "( 2005 ) , hexte cluster a did not function from 2004 december 13 to 2005 january 14 .",
    "thus , we utilize only the data acquired with hexte cluster b.    using part of the _ rxte _ data sets that were acquired in the descent phase , the behavior of the fundamental crsf was already studied @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we complement these studies of the descent phase , by analyzing those datasets which were left unused .",
    "in addition , we analyze the ascent - phase datasets to examine whether the crsf energy exhibits any hysteresis effects similar to those suggested by the 4u  0115 + 63 data @xcite .",
    "during the 4 months of observation , several energetic background events , such as large solar flares and precipitations of high - energy particles trapped in the radiation belts , affected some of the data sets . in order to exclude such low - quality data , we inspected the electron - rate light curves , and have selected 86 data sets with good quality as listed in table [ t1 ] . to analyze them",

    "we assume 1% systematic error for all energy bins of the pca data ( same as in nakajima et al .",
    "all of the errors presented in this paper are 90% confidence levels .",
    "as shown in figure [ f1 ] , the intensity of x0331 + 53 changed largely in the asm , pca and hexte energy bands during this outburst . in addition , the hardness - ratio exhibited an anti - correlation to the source count rates as shown in figure [ f1]d . in order to investigate the luminosity",
    "related crsfs changes through this outburst , we need to establish a unified spectral modeling which can be applied consistently to the data sets at all luminosity levels .",
    "so , we first examined pulse - phase - averaged pca and hexte spectra from several representative data sets .    since many of the data sets have rather short exposure , we selected four representative ones sets with relatively long exposures , denoted in table [ t1 ] as dec 2a , dec 24 , jan 20 , and feb 13b ; these represent the beginning , the peak , the declining phase , and the end of the outburst , respectively .",
    "figure [ f2]a shows the background - subtracted pcu2 ( @xmath29 kev ) and hexte b ( @xmath30 kev ) spectra obtained on these four occasions .",
    "the pca background spectra were all estimated with the bright - background model @xcite , while the hexte backgrounds were extracted from the off - source position which is offset from the source by 1.5 degrees @xcite .",
    "the four spectra , even in their raw forms , clearly reveal the prominent fundamental crsf at @xmath31 kev , which was observed in the previous ( makishima et al .",
    "1990a , b ) and the present ( kreykenbohm et al .  2005 ; pottschmidt et al .  2005 ; mowlavi et al .  2006",

    "this model successfully reproduced the continuum spectra of 4u  0115 + 63 ( mihara et al .",
    "2004 ; nakajima 2006 ; nakajima et al .",
    "2006ab ) at various luminosity levels .",
    "as already reported by several authors ( e.g. makishima et al .",
    "1999 ; coburn et al .",
    "2002 ) , the determinations of the cyclotron line parameters are affected by the continuum and the line modeling . employing this model , we can compare the results of this work with the previous ones @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have selected this model .",
    "we first attempted to fit the 4 spectra with the npex model , with @xmath35 , @xmath37 , @xmath36 , and @xmath38 all left free .",
    "since the pca background estimations are only good to a few percent , we further adjusted the background normalizations down to a level of @xmath141% , following the method described in the _ rxte cook book_. however , as expected , the npex model gave acceptable fits to none of the four spectra .",
    "as revealed clearly by the data - to - model ratio in figure [ f2]b , all the four spectra exhibit the fundamental crsf strongly at @xmath31 kev . the second harmonic crsf is observed not only in the brighter two spectra , but also in the two fainter ones .",
    "in addition , the spectrum on dec 24 exhibits evidence of the third harmonic crsf at @xmath25 kev , as already reported by coburn et al .",

    "we next introduce a cyclotron absorption model .",
    "although some authors used gaussian - shaped absorption cross section @xcite to reproduce the crsf , we employ the cyclotron absorption ( cyab ) factor which has been used successfully ( clark et al .",

    "the cyab factor is described as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the resonance energy , @xmath43 is the resonance width , @xmath44 is the resonance depth , and @xmath45 is the harmonic number ( with @xmath46 fundamental ) . using high - quality _ suzaku _ data , enoto et al .",
    "( 2008 ) confirmed that eq.[e2 ] can successfully reproduce the 36 kev crsf of the x - ray pulsar her x-1 , whereas the gaussian - shaped absorption cross - section is less successful .",
    "since we already know that x0331 + 53 has the multiple crsfs , we attempted to fit the data with an npex model multiplied by two cyab factors ( hereafter npex@xmath47cyab2 model ) .",
    "the values of @xmath9 and @xmath27 were both left to vary independently , rather than constrained as @xmath27@xmath48@xmath9 . as a result , the fits were much improved compared to the npex fit , as shown by the data - to - model ratios in figure [ f2]c . due to the complex shape of the fundamental crsfs ,",
    "however , the npex@xmath47cyab2 model is not yet fully successful , with @xmath49 .",

    "although a more sophisticated crsf modeling has been introduced by schnherr et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we employ the cyab and gabs models in the present work , so that the results can be directly compared with previous studies of the luminosity dependence of crsfs ( makishima et al .",

    "; nakajima et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we fitted the four spectra by the npex@xmath47cyab2@xmath47gabs model , namely the same npex@xmath47cyab2 model but further multiplied by eq.[e3 ] , in which the three gabs parameters ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) were left free but @xmath51 was given an initial value close to @xmath9 .",
    "due to low statistics in the higher energies , we fixed @xmath27 at 2@xmath9 in fitting the dec 2a and feb 13b data , while we left @xmath9 and @xmath27 both free and independent for the brighter two data sets . then , as illustrated in figure [ f2]d , the four spectra have been described successfully with this model .",
    "the derived best - fit parameters are summarized in table [ t2 ] . to see the configuration of the nested cyclotron models for the fundamental resonance , the spectrum observed on dec 24",
    "is presented in figure [ f3 ] in its @xmath54 form .",
    "thus , the cyab factor explains the gross shape of the fundamental crsf , while the remaining narrow core is represented by the additional gabs factor .",
    "the value of @xmath51 agrees , within a few percent , with @xmath55 , or @xmath56@xmath9 in the present case , where the cyab factor becomes deepest @xcite . for comparison , kreykenbohm et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and pottschmidt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) applied nested two gabs factors to the fundamental crsf and obtained two gaussian centroids which differs by @xmath57% .    since the continuum and the crsf factor couple strongly ,",
    "the 90%-confidence errors of individual fit parameters , given in table 2 , might be significantly underestimated .",
    "to examine this concern , we present in figure [ f4 ] confidence contours between several pairs of the model parameters , obtained from the dec 24 data .",
    "thus , @xmath38 and the resonance energies are almost uncorrelated .",
    "although the npex @xmath36 and the cyab @xmath9 exhibit some correlations , the single - parameter 90% error ranges are confirmed to adequately represent the two - dimensional confidence ranges , without being under - estimated .    from these spectral analyses ,",
    "we have established the unified model , which can reproduce the complex shape of the x0331 + 53 spectra regardless of the source luminosity .",
    "hereafter , we use this model , namely , npex@xmath47cyab2@xmath47gabs .",
    "although our analysis was performed with the heasoft version 6.0.5 , the pca response generator has been updated in the latest heasoft version 6.8 , and a new pca caldb has been released on 2009 december 2 . to examine possible effects of these software and calibration updates , we analyzed the dec 24 data with the heasoft version 6.8 and the latest pca caldb .",
    "as a consequence , the cyclotron resonance energies changed only @xmath141.0% , which is within statistical errors .",
    "thus , we retain our results obtained with the heasoft version 6.0.5 .    just for comparison , we attempted to replace the cyab modeling of the two crsfs with that employing three gabs factors , with nested two for the fundamental and the other for the second harmonic .",

    ". however , we retain our original modeling using the cyab model , because it gives generally better fits : for example , the difference in @xmath70 is 28 ( for @xmath71 ) in the case of the dec 24 spectrum .",
    "we applied the model established in  [ sec3.1 ] to all the daily - averaged spectra , and studied the time evolution of the crsf parameters .",
    "since some data sets have insufficient statistics , the gabs model parameters did not converge .",
    "following the obtained results in the previous subsection , we therefore fixed @xmath72 in all cases . the other procedures of the spectral analyses are the same as in  [ sec3.1 ] .    as a result of this analysis",
    ", our model has given acceptable fits to all the data acquired in the major outburst spanning 2004 november through 2005 february . while the normalization parameters of the npex model varied in correlation with the luminosity , the npex @xmath38 , which is thought to give a measure of the electron temperature in the emission region @xcite , stayed rather constant like in the previous results on 4u  0115 + 63 @xcite .",
    "although the fundamental crsf parameters are well determined , the second crsf parameters in some data sets became unconstrained due to insufficient data statistics in higher energies .",
    "in such cases , we fixed @xmath27 at 2@xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to the november - february outburst data , the remaining three data sets were observed in march during the minor outburst recovery ( figure [ f1 ] ) .",
    "since the source was rather faint on these occasions , the three spectra were reproduced with the npex model multiplied by a single cyab factor describing the fundamental crsf .",
    "therefore , we do not discuss these data sets acquired in 2005 march .",

    "in addition , we found no hysteresis effects in the variation of @xmath9 between the ascent and descent phases .",

    "as our further confirmation of the luminosity - dependent changes in the crsf energies and their ratios , we fitted the fd1 and fd6 spectra simultaneously , with the npex@xmath47cyab2 model . while the model parameters were generally allowed to differ between the two spectra , we imposed 4 stepwise constraints on the resonance energies .",
    "in the first step , we required @xmath9 to be the same between fd1 and fd6 , and constrained @xmath27 to be twice @xmath9 .",
    "however , the fit was not acceptable , with @xmath119 .",
    "next , we allowed fd1 and fd6 to have different values of @xmath9 , but retained the 1:2 harmonic constraint on both spectra .",
    "this gave an improved fit with @xmath120 , implying that the two spectra have different resonance energies .",
    "third , we allowed the two spectra to have different values of @xmath9 , but required them to have the same @xmath27/@xmath9 ratio .",
    "the fit was then improved to @xmath121 , together with @xmath27/@xmath9@xmath122 which deviate from the the nominal value 2.0 .",
    "finally , we left all the four resonance energies free , and obtained a improved fit with @xmath123 .",
    "this means that the @xmath27/@xmath9 ratio is different not only from the harmonic condition , but also between the two spectra .",
    "( the fit is still unacceptable because we did not include the gabs factor to model the narrow core of the fundamental resonance . )",
    "finally , we repeated the same 4-step analyses , but using the plcut continuum .",
    "then , the fit goodness from the 4 steps were @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "the implication is essentially the same as that derived with the npex continuum .      since the flux - sorted spectra have rather good statistics , we examined them , up to 110 kev , for evidence of the third harmonic crsf which was already reported by kreykenbohm et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and pottschmidt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . for this purpose , we further multiplied the npex@xmath47cyab2@xmath47gabs model by an additional cyab factor centered at @xmath25 kev , and applied it to the flux sorted spectra .",
    "then , two data sets , fa1 and fd2 , gave statistical significant ( at @xmath1490% ) evidence for the third crsf , while the fundamental and second - harmonic crsf parameters remained essentially the same as before .",
    "as a representative case , the third resonance parameters derived from the fa1 data are @xmath128@xmath129 kev , @xmath130 kev , and @xmath131 .",
    "these parameters are comparable to the previous results derived from the same _ rxte _ data @xcite .",
    "the third resonance energy was found to change no less than by @xmath1323% , as the @xmath0 kev luminosity varied from @xmath133 to @xmath134 erg s@xmath3 . over this luminosity range ,",
    "the @xmath128/@xmath27 ratio stayed at an average value of 1.46 within a typical uncertainty of @xmath135 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath128/@xmath9 ratio is systematically higher , 3.2",
    ". therefore , @xmath128 and @xmath27 are consistent with being in the 2:3 harmonic ratio , while @xmath9 is inferred to be systematically lower , and depend significantly on the luminosity .",
    "in addition to the investigation of the resonance energy changes , we examined whether the depths of the cyclotron resonance , @xmath136 ( @xmath110 ) and @xmath53 , depend on the luminosity .",
    "figure [ f12 ] shows these depth parameters , against the @xmath0 kev luminosity .",
    "both the fundamental and second crsf depths , @xmath137 and @xmath138 respectively were found to decrease toward higher luminosities .",
    "although @xmath53 has large errors , it also exhibits the same tendency . these luminosity dependence in @xmath137 and @xmath138",
    "are statistically significant , because fitting the @xmath137 and @xmath138 measurements with constant values gave reduced chi - square of 2.11 ( @xmath139 ) , 5.88 ( @xmath139 ) , respectively .",
    "we analyzed the whole set of _ rxte _ pca and hexte data of x0331 + 53 , covering the 2004@xmath1402005 outburst , with two objectives in mind .",
    "one is to examine whether the luminosity - anticorrelated changes in the fundamental crsf energy , observed during the outburst descent phase ( mowlavi et al .",
    "2006 ; nakajima 2006 ; tsygankov et al .",
    "2006 ) , is also present during the outburst rising phase .",
    "this agrees with the conclusion of tsygankov et al .",
    "the other is to examine the reported second harmonic resonance of this pulsar ( coburn et al .",
    "2005 ; kreykenbohm et al .  2005 ; pottschmidt et al .",
    "2005 ) for possible luminosity - dependent changes , and compare the results with those of the fundamental crsf .    following our experience ( e.g. , mihara 1995 ; makishima et al .",
    "1999 ) , we adopted the npex model of eq.[e1 ] to represent the underlying 3@xmath14080 kev pca and hexte continua , while two cyab factors , eq.[e2 ] , to account for the fundamental and second harmonic cyclotron features .",
    "furthermore , to express the complex shape of the deep fundamental cyclotron feature as revealed in the previous studies @xcite , we introduced a fine - tuning gabs factor , eq.[e3 ] , which is nested with the fundamental cyab factor .",
    "this npex@xmath47cyab2@xmath47gabs model has given acceptable fits to all the daily - averaged and flux - sorted spectra .",
    "furthermore , some of the spectra exhibited statistically significant evidence for the third harmonic resonance , as already reported by coburn et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , kreykenbohm et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and pottschmidt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    as exemplified in figure [ f12 ] and table [ t3 ]",
    ", our fits generally imply that the fundamental and second harmonic resonances both have optical depths of @xmath141 , with comparable cyab widths of @xmath142 kev .",
    "the fundamental crsf is explained mainly by the cyab model , with the additional gabs factor carrying @xmath143 of the optical depth when the source is luminous . replacing the two cyab models with two gabs models",
    "made the fits significantly worse ( e.g. @xmath144@xmath145 in fa2 spectrum fitting ) , mainly because the observed flux falls considerably below the npex continuum , even at the @xmath146 kev range which is in between the two cyclotron troughs ( see figure [ f3 ] ) .",
    "this effect can not be reproduced adequately by the gabs model which is symmetric between the red and blue sides , while it can be successfully accounted for by the cyab factor of which the wing is more extended in the blue side due to the @xmath147 factor in eq.[e2 ] .      by applying the npex@xmath47cyab2@xmath47gabs model to the daily - averaged and flux - sorted pca@xmath148hexte spectra , we reconfirmed the reports by mowlavi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , nakajima ( 2006 ) , and tsygankov et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2009 ) , that the fundamental crsf energy @xmath9 decreases as the source gets more luminous ( figure [ f9 ] ) .",
    "thus , x0331 + 53 becomes a second binary x - ray pulsar , after 4u  0115 + 63 , of which @xmath9 correlates negatively with the source luminosity . like the case of 4u  0115 + 63 ,",
    "this effect observed from x0331 + 53 can be explained by presuming that the cyclotron resonance `` photosphere '' gets higher in the accretion column , as the source luminosity increases and hence the column becomes taller @xcite .",
    "these cases make a contrast to the behavior of her x-1 , in which @xmath9 is reported to have been varying in a positive correlation with the luminosity @xcite , at least while the source is in a sub - eddington regime . on the other hand ,",
    "the recent works of her x-1 @xcite reported that the anti - correlation behavior might exist when the source was in the super - eddington regime .    in 4u",
    "0115 + 63 , the luminosity dependence of @xmath9 showed some hysteresis effects between the ascent and descent phases of the outburst ( nakajima et al .",
    "in contrast , we found , in agreement with tsygankov et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , no such effects from x0331 + 53 ; in this source , the value of @xmath9 can be considered as a single - valued function of the source luminosity .    as the most important result of the present work , our npex@xmath47cyab2@xmath47gabs modeling leads to an inference that the second resonance energy @xmath27 also correlates negatively with the source luminosity , but significantly more weakly than @xmath9 does .",
    "the two resonance energies decrease by @xmath149 and @xmath150 , as the @xmath0 kev luminosity increases from @xmath90 to @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath27/@xmath9 ratio is consistent with the nominal value of 2.0 when the source is dim , while it increases to @xmath8 toward the outburst peak ( figure [ f9]c ) .",
    "these effects are somewhat model dependent , and become less significant when the absorption profile and/or continuum shape are modeled in different ways .",
    "although these effects were already noticed by tsygankov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , their spectra had rather low statistics in higher energies , and hence the second crsf parameters were not well constrained .",
    "while the relativistic effects @xcite predicts the @xmath27/@xmath9 ratios to be lower than the harmonic value of 2 , actual measurements do not necessarily agree .",
    "the ratio exceeds 2.0 in some cases , and fall in the range @xmath151 ; for example , 4u  1907 + 09 showed @xmath9 @xmath152 kev and @xmath27 @xmath153 kev @xcite ; vela x-1 showed @xmath9 @xmath154 kev and @xmath27 @xmath155 kev @xcite ; and a0535 + 26 @xmath9 @xmath24 kev and @xmath27 @xmath156 kev @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the ratios lower than 2.0 are reported in other cases , including the present _ rxte _ data of x0331 + 53 themselves analyzed by some other authors ( e.g. , pottschmidt et al .",
    "2006 ) who generally took the deepest positions of the crsfs as the resonance energies (  [ sec3.3 ] ) .",
    "a dominant origin of the reported scatter in the @xmath27/@xmath9 ratio is presumably the use of different ( e.g. , cyab vs. gabs ) modeling of the crsf profile . in this sense ,",
    "our result of @xmath27/@xmath9@xmath157 is not free from this systematic problem .",
    "in fact , we find @xmath27/@xmath9@xmath1582 if instead using @xmath159/@xmath160 .",
    "nevertheless , our result has some pieces of supporting evidence .",
    "one is that the cyab modeling is more successful than that with the gabs factor (  [ sec3.1 ] ) , when combined with the npex continuum .",
    "another is that the third to second resonance energy ratio , @xmath128/@xmath27 , is consistent with 1.5 , while @xmath128/@xmath9 is higher than the nominal value of 3.0 .",
    "yet another support is provided by a physically self - consistent interpretation to be described in the next subsection . even admitting that the absolute values of @xmath9 and @xmath27 might be subject to the systematic modeling uncertainly ,",
    "the luminosity - dependent changes in the resonance energy ratio is considered to be robust as already shown in  [ sec3.3 ] .",
    "let us consider a possible explanation of the luminosity - dependent changes in @xmath9 , @xmath27 , and their ratios . according to mihara et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and nakajima et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , the observed changes in @xmath9 of 4u  0115 + 63 can be explained in terms of those in the height of cyclotron resonance `` photosphere '' , in combination with a dipole field geometry . in this scenario ,",
    "the photosphere height above the neutron star surface , @xmath161 , can be estimated as @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the neutron star radius , @xmath164 is the resonance energy to be observed on the neutron - star surface , and @xmath45 is the harmonic number .    substituting the @xmath9 and @xmath27 values derived from the flux - sorted analysis (  [ sec3.3 ] ) into eq.[e7 ] , @xmath161 of the fundamental and second resonances",
    "have been estimated as shown in figure [ f13 ] . here",
    ", we employed @xmath165 kev and @xmath166 kev , referring to the lowest - luminosity state in figure [ f9 ] .",
    "also a typical value of @xmath167 km was employed . by translating the measurements into the photospheric heights , the figure thus yields two important implications .",
    "one is that the photosphere of the fundamental crsf gets higher as the source luminosity increases , up to 800 m , or @xmath142% of @xmath163 .",
    "the other is that the second resonance photosphere , though increasing with the luminosity as well , is located closer to the surface than that of the fundamental , just reflecting the deviation of the @xmath27/@xmath9 ratio from 2.0 .",
    "the height difference between the two photospheres reach @xmath14500 m when the source is most luminous . like the estimation of @xmath161 described above , we also calculated the resonance heights using the asymptotic energies @xmath168 which are derived from @xmath169 .",
    "assume @xmath170 kev and @xmath171 kev , the luminosity - dependent height variations turned out to be @xmath172 m for @xmath160 and @xmath173 m for @xmath159 .",
    "the altitude difference between the two photospheres can be explained qualitatively in the following manner .",
    "theoretically ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the fundamental crsf is predicted to have a cross section which is @xmath19 times larger than that of the second resonance .",
    "then , we expect the fundamental photosphere to be formed nearly at the top of the accretion column .",
    "in contrast , the second harmonic photosphere will appear at lower altitudes , where the column density integrated along our line of sight is expected to become higher .",
    "these effects have already predicted theoretically by nishimura ( 2008 ) .",
    "then , a detailed modeling of the @xmath27/@xmath9 ratio may provide a valuable probe into the density distribution along the accretion column , and its dependence on the mass accretion rate , although such a work is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "assuming that the luminosity - dependent changes in the resonance energies are caused by the photospheric height variations , and not , e.g. , by relativistic effects (  [ sec4.2 ] ) , the above physical picture further gives an _ a posteriori _ support to our finding of @xmath27/@xmath9@xmath174 .",
    "in fact , if this ratio fell below 2.0 toward lower luminosities , we would have to conclude that the 2nd resonance photosphere is located higher than that of the fundamental , leading to a physically unrealistic condition .",
    "following our previous results on 4u  0115 + 63 @xcite , the present work provides valuable information as to the luminosity dependent changes of the crsf parameters in accreting x - ray pulsars . although the fundamental crsf of x0331 + 53 required the additional gabs factor ( which was not needed in 4u  0115 + 63 ) , the cyab and gabs centroids varied similarly as shown in figure [ f9 ] and [ f12 ] .",
    "we therefore consider that this slight difference in the crsf modeling does not hamper a direct comparison of the results from the two sources .",
    "let us fist compare the luminosity dependence of @xmath9 in the two objects .",
    "as shown in figure [ f14]a , the resonance energy of x0331 + 53 depends on the luminosity much less steeply than that of 4u  0115 + 63 , even though the sense of dependence is the same between them . specifically , the dependence is expressed as @xmath175 in x0331 + 53 , while @xmath176 in 4u  0115 + 63 .",
    "assuming that the change in @xmath9 is caused by variations in the height of cyclotron resonance `` photosphere '' , the above difference suggests that the accretion column height of 4u  0115 + 63 responds more sensitively to changes in the mass accretion rate .",
    "this inference is reinforced by figure [ f14]b , which directly relates the estimated photosphere heights with the luminosity .",
    "this difference , in turn , may be attributed to differences in the accretion column shape . indeed , as shown in figure [ f15 ] , the resonance depths @xmath177 of x0331 + 53 depend negatively on the resonance width @xmath178 , while the correlation is opposite in 4u  0115 + 63 . according to previous studies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , this is considered to indicate that the accretion column in 4u  0115 + 63 has a tall cylindrical shape , whereas that in x0331 + 53 a flat coin - like shape .",
    "the two sources are inferred to differ not only in the shape of the accretion column , but also in its area @xmath179 .",
    "we expect the observed luminosity to be expressed as @xmath180 @xcite , where @xmath181 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath182 is the accretion column temperature which can be approximated by the observed npex @xmath38 @xcite . by substituting the derived parameters into this relation ,",
    "we actually find x0331 + 53 to have a 1.43 times larger @xmath179 than 4u  0115 + 63 .",
    "the relatively shallow spin modulation in x0331 + 53 @xcite supports this idea .",
    "therefore , the accretion column in x0331 + 53 is considered to have a coin - like shape and a rather large area , so that its height depends only weakly on the mass accretion rate .",
    "let us finally discuss the behavior of the resonance depths .",
    "as already mentioned in the end of section [ sec3.3 ] , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath183 of x0331 + 53 have all been found to decrease toward higher luminosity .",
    "this change is in the same sense as those in 4u  0115 + 63 @xcite and gx301 - 2 @xcite .",
    "one possible mechanism causing such a dependence may be related to the appearance of higher harmonic resonances .",
    "as argued by several authors @xcite , an increased luminosity may give rise to significant higher harmonic resonances , which tend to make the fundamental resonance shallower through so - called `` two - photon '' effects @xcite .",
    "in fact , the third crsf of x0331 + 53 was confirmed to appear when the source becomes luminous .    in summary , we have quantified luminosity dependence of the fundamental and second resonance energies , and discovered clear luminosity - dependent changes in their ratio . in addition , we have discovered that the behavior of x0331 + 53 is qualitatively similar to that of 4u  0115 + 53 , but differs quantitatively .",
