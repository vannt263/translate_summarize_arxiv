    "angular correlations between jets produced together with heavy particles have been studied actively for a long time , because they can provide important information about the heavy particles  @xcite .",
    "for instance it has been shown that the distribution of the azimuthal angle difference @xmath1 between two partons in the gluon fusion production of a higgs boson plus the two partons is very sensitive to a charge - conjugation and parity ( cp ) property of the higgs boson  @xcite . by observing the @xmath2 distribution and comparing it with theoretical predictions",
    ", we can measure cp violation in the higgs sector  @xcite .",
    "+ in order to read the information of heavy particles from angular correlations between jets produced in association with them , it will be necessary to produce the accurate predictions of observables , such as @xmath2 , which measure the angular correlations .",
    "tree level merging algorithms  @xcite , which combine leading order ( lo ) cross sections for multi - parton in final state with the parton shower , are nowadays standard tools used for simulating processes including multi - jet in final state .",
    "models of the parton shower base the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equation  @xcite and thus the parton shower guarantees the leading logarithmic ( ll ) accuracy for the kinematics of produced partons .",
    "therefore the accuracy guaranteed in merging algorithms can be seen as the lo plus ll .",
    "the virtue of merging algorithms is that they can combine lo cross sections smoothly with the ll parton shower so that the dependence on an artificial scale at which they are combined is minimized . +",
    "a lo multi - parton production cross section predicts angular correlations between the produced partons at the lo accuracy , while the ll parton shower does not have ability to predict angular correlations between any partons .",
    "considering this fact , when our objective is to predict angular correlations between constructed jets , the accuracy minimally required for the kinematics of the jets should be the lo , neither lo+ll nor ll . if the kinematics of a jet is determined or largely influenced by the ll parton shower during a merging procedure , it hardly has the lo accuracy and hence it is not appropriate to use the event containing this jet .",
    "merging algorithms in the literature potentially have the ambiguity in the accuracy of jets , namely it is not necessarily clear whether the kinematics of a jet constructed by clustering particles in final state after a merging procedure has the lo accuracy or not .",
    "this is because their virtue is smooth combination of lo cross sections and the ll parton shower . + in ref  @xcite , the azimuthal angle difference @xmath1 between the two highest transverse momentum @xmath3 jets with a large rapidity separation in the @xmath4 pair production is studied by using the ckkw - l merging algorithm  @xcite with the parton shower model  @xcite in pythia8  @xcite .",
    "there , it is found that the correlation between the 2-jet can be lost in a non - negligible fraction of the events when the lo cross sections for the @xmath4 plus up to 2-parton are merged with the parton shower , because a jet originating from the parton shower has a higher @xmath3 than one of the two jets originating from the 2-parton of the lo cross section .",
    "this shows one example of the case that the kinematics of a jet is determined or largely influenced by the ll parton shower during a merging procedure .",
    "although it is also found that the loss of the correlation can be avoided by merging the lo @xmath5-parton cross section additionally , calculating lo cross sections for higher multiplicity is time - consuming , thus we want to avoid it .",
    "+ in this work i construct a new merging algorithm which does guarantee the lo accuracy of angular correlations between jets and hence does not have the above ambiguity .",
    "the sudakov suppression is calculated in the same way as the mlm  @xcite and the @xmath6-jet mlm  @xcite algorithms .",
    "the differences from these algorithms are    * the definition of jets used during a merging procedure is set identical to the one used during physics analyses of jets . * the lo @xmath7-parton production cross section , where @xmath7 denotes the maximal number of partons produced by the lo cross section , is not allowed to produce the events which contain more than @xmath7-jet .",
    "the first point indicates that @xmath0-jet events are generated exclusively according to the lo @xmath0-parton production cross section and furthermore each of the @xmath0-jet is close to each of the @xmath0-parton in terms of the jet measure . as a result",
    ", angular correlations between the @xmath0-jet should follow those between the @xmath0-parton and hence the lo accuracy of them should be robust .",
    "in addition to this , when @xmath0-jet events are exclusively subjects to a study , only the lo @xmath0-parton production cross section is needed , thus event generation is efficient .",
    "+ the second point makes it forbidden to produce the events which contain more than @xmath7-jet .",
    "if our objective is to predict angular correlations between two jets such as @xmath2 at the lo accuracy , not only do the two jets have angular correlations between them at the lo accuracy , but all of the additional jets also should have angular correlations with the two jets at the same accuracy , because the additional jets can affect @xmath2 kinematically . if the kinematics of the additional jets is determined by the ll parton shower , those jets do not have angular correlations with any other jets .",
    "in such a case , the accuracy of @xmath2 will be less than the lo .",
    "our objective is to predict angular correlations between jets at the lo accuracy , therefore the events which contain more than @xmath7-jet should not be used for analyses . in my algorithm",

    "+ the @xmath4 production in proton - proton collisions is simulated and the azimuthal angle difference @xmath1 between the two highest @xmath3 jets with large rapidity separations is studied by using the 2-jet events exclusively .",

    "the correspondence between the curves and the merging algorithms are shown inside the panels.,title=\"fig : \" ]   with the rapidity separation @xmath123 ( upper two panels ) and @xmath124 ( lower two panels ) in the 2-jet events .",
    "the correspondence between the curves and the merging algorithms are shown inside the panels.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in figure  [ figure : dphi - dist ] the @xmath2 distributions are shown . the normalized differential cross section as a function of @xmath2 with the rapidity separation @xmath123 and that as a function of @xmath2 with the rapidity separation @xmath124 are shown in the upper two panels and the lower two panels , respectively . the correspondence between the curves and the merging algorithms are shown inside the panels .",
    "+ in the left panels of figure  [ figure : dphi - dist ] , the ckkw - l at @xmath8 and the ckkw - l at @xmath9 are compared .",
    "the difference between the two predictions , particularly in the upper left panel , can be explained from a loss of the correlation due to the contribution from the leading logarithmic ( ll ) parton shower in the ckkw - l at @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "+ in the right panels of figure  [ figure : dphi - dist ] , the model a algorithm and the ckkw - l at @xmath9 are compared .",
    "it is shown that the model a algorithm produces a consistent prediction with the ckkw - l at @xmath9 , despite that only the lo @xmath112-parton cross section contributes to the events in the model a algorithm . since the lo accuracy of @xmath2",
    "is guaranteed in the model a algorithm , this observation confirms the finding in ref .",
    "@xcite that the lo accuracy of @xmath2 in the 2-jet events can not be fully retained due to the contribution from the ll parton shower in the ckkw - l at @xmath8 and it can be retained by merging the lo @xmath5-parton cross section additionally i.e. the ckkw - l at @xmath9",
    ". it should be worth emphasizing that , in the model a algorithm , the lo @xmath5-parton cross section never contributes the @xmath2 distributions in figure  [ figure : dphi - dist ] , since it contributes exclusively to the 3-jet events .",
    "in this paper , a new tree level merging algorithm which guarantees the leading order ( lo ) accuracy of angular correlations between jets is proposed .",
    "the new algorithm has been constructed with a goal of eliminating the ambiguity in the accuracy of jets , namely it is not necessarily clear whether the kinematics of a jet constructed by clustering partons in final state after a merging procedure has the lo accuracy or not .",
    "this ambiguity potentially exists in merging algorithm , because their virtue is smooth combination of lo cross sections and the leading logarithmic ( ll ) parton shower .",
    "the new algorithm requires that @xmath0-jet events are generated exclusively according to the lo @xmath0-parton production cross section and each of the @xmath0-jet is close to each of the @xmath0-parton in terms of the jet measure . as a result",
    ", angular correlations between the @xmath0-jet should follow those between the @xmath0-parton and thus the lo accuracy of them is robust .",
    "furthermore , as long as the @xmath0-jet events are exclusively under consideration , only the lo @xmath0-parton production cross section is needed and hence event generation is efficient . + the @xmath4 production in proton - proton collisions is simulated and then the distributions of the azimuthal angle differences @xmath80 between the two highest transverse momentum @xmath3 jets with large rapidity separations , namely @xmath123 and @xmath124 in addition to @xmath125 i.e. the vbf cuts , are studied by using the 2-jet events exclusively .",
    "the new algorithm is evaluated by comparing its predictions with the predictions of one of well - established merging algorithms , the ckkw - l algorithm .",
    "+ it has been observed that the new algorithm produces a consistent prediction with the ckkw - l at @xmath9 , where @xmath7 denotes the maximal number of partons produced by the lo cross section , despite that only the lo @xmath112-parton cross section contributes to the events in the mew algorithm . since the lo accuracy of @xmath2",
    "is guaranteed in the new algorithm , this observation confirms the previous finding that the lo accuracy of @xmath2 in the 2-jet events can not be fully retained due to contribution from the leading logarithmic ( ll ) parton shower in the ckkw - l at @xmath8 and it can be retained by merging the lo @xmath5-parton cross section additionally i.e. in the ckkw - l at @xmath9 . + in the numerical studies of this work , only the @xmath2 distributions in the @xmath112-jet events are studied and only the ckkw - l algorithm with the pythia8 parton shower is used as one of other merging algorithms to validate the new algorithm . therefore , the observation in this work is limited to this situation , obviously . however , it is always the case that other merging algorithms including the ckkw - l algorithm potentially have the ambiguity in the accuracy of jets , dependently of a process , an observable and a shower model .",
    "in contrast , the new algorithm does not have the ambiguity and always guarantees the lo accuracy of angular correlations between jets , independently of a process , an observable and a shower model .",
    "+ there are basically two parameters which can not be determined uniquely in the new algorithm , namely @xmath81 and the definition of the parton shower starting scale .",
    "this fact might be seen as a weak point in the algorithm .",
    "however merging algorithms and parton shower programs are just models after all .",
    "a promising approach will be to tune the algorithm together with a parton shower model by using these parameters so that the @xmath3 and the rapidity distributions of jets in a given process become consistent with the data at first and then make the predictions of observables measuring angular correlations between the jets .",
