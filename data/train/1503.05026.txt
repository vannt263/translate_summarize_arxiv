    "the possibility of a fault - tolerant topological quantum computation @xcite based upon topological quasiparticles that obey non - abelian statistics ( non - abelian anyons ) @xcite motivated much recent interest in the new systems that support such quasiparticles .",
    "the idea behind the topological quantum computation is that non - abelian anyons could be used to encode and manipulate information in a way that is resistant to error .",
    "namely , if a quantum system has topological degrees of freedom , like non - abelian anyons , then the information contained in those degrees of freedom will be protected against errors caused by local interactions with the environment .",
    "this provides the possibility of using such systems to perform fault - tolerant quantum computation without decoherence .",
    "non - abelian states of matter also present the fundamental intellectual challenge of principle and of experimental realization @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the origin and properties of non - abelian phases is far from complete and is at the frontier of current theoretical research .",
    "the fundamental objectives are the understanding of the interplay between topology and quantum mechanics that leads to the formation of non - abelian phases and the investigation of new models that have non - abelian quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "non - abelian anyons first appeared in the context of the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect @xcite , since fqh systems are believed to have a series of exotic non - abelian states .",
    "such states , like the pfaffian state @xcite , which is the exact ground state of quantum hall hamiltonians with three - body contact interactions , have elementary excitations that are non - abelian anyons .",
    "similar states have also been predicted to occur in cold atoms @xcite , superconductors with @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry @xcite , hybrid systems of superconductors with topological insulators and/or semiconductors @xcite , and non - abelian lattice spin models @xcite .",
    "although non - abelian states are associated with two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems , analogous states can be found in certain one - dimensional ( 1d ) models @xcite .",
    "ultimately , such 1d non - abelian states must be braided in order to compute .",
    "this could be achieved by combining 1d systems into a 2d network as previously proposed in the case of majorana fermions @xcite .",
    "understanding how to build states that support non - abelian defects is an important building block towards topological computation . in this paper",
    "we refine a previous proposal for a pfaffian - like state that was proposed as an ansatz for the ground state of bosonic atoms subject to three - body infinite repulsive interactions and in a 1d optical lattice @xcite .",
    "although such three - body interactions are rare in nature , several experimentally realizable methods have been proposed to realize dominant three - body interactions between bosonic atoms in optical lattices @xcite . in particular",
    ", three - body interactions can be efficiently simulated by mixtures of bosonic atoms and molecules under conditions that are achievable with current technology in systems of atoms and molecules in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "therefore , the physical system that we consider is a collection of bosonic atoms and diatomic feshbach molecules trapped in a 1d optical lattice . under certain experimentally achievable conditions ,",
    "the system can be described by an effective hamiltonian for bosonic atoms with two - body and three - body contact interactions @xcite .",
    "we study the ground states and elementary excitations of the system in the limit of infinite repulsive three - body interactions and for a range of values of the two - body interaction strength .",
    "the pfaffian - like ansatz was originally proposed as an ansatz for the ground - state wave function of the system in the absence of two - body interactions @xcite .",
    "however , our results show that the pfaffian - like ansatz wave function most closely corresponds to the exact ground - state wave function of the system at some finite value of the two - body interaction strength .",
    "the results also indicate that in the thermodynamic limit this value of the interaction strength might be close to the value where the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from the superfluid state to the mott insulating state , as previously found within the bosonization approach @xcite .",
    "non - abelian states of matter order their constituent particles following a hidden global pattern that is not associated with the breaking of any symmetry @xcite . this leads to a degeneracy that is not based upon simple symmetry considerations and is robust against perturbations and interactions with the environment .",
    "topological quasiparticles of such systems exhibit an exotic statistical behavior .",
    "namely , the interchange of two identical quasiparticles takes one ground state into another .",
    "if two different exchanges are performed consecutively among the quasiparticles , the final state of the system will depend upon the order in which these exchanges were carried out .",
    "this ordering dependence is the reason why such states and their quasiparticles are called non - abelian or noncommutative .",
    "in addition , the quasiparticles of a non - abelian system are neither fermions nor bosons , which motivated the name anyons .",
    "the pfaffian - like states that we consider in this paper can not be characterized by any local order parameter and exhibit a global hidden order that is associated with the organization of bosons in identical indistinguishable clusters .",
    "indistinguishability between the clusters is achieved by symmetrization over the subsets of coordinates of each cluster .",
    "this symmetrization introduces the possibility of topological degeneracy in the space of quasiparticles and makes these states potential carriers of non - abelian excitations @xcite .",
    "our explicit calculations use variationally optimized entangled - plaquette states for systems of up to 60 sites .",
    "these are benchmarked with exact diagonalization ( ed ) studies of systems of up to 14 sites .",
    "using the ed method , we first study ground - state properties and elementary excitations of the system for small system sizes and with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the pfaffian - like ansatz was originally proposed as an ansatz for the ground - state wave function of the system in the absence of two - body interactions ( vanishing two - body interaction strength ) @xcite .",
    "however , our ed results clearly demonstrate that the pfaffian - like ansatz better approximates the ground state of the system at some finite value of the two - body interaction strength .",
    "this interaction strength increases with increasing system size .",
    "also , the overlap of the exact ground - state wave function at such a value of the two - body interaction strength and the pfaffian - like ansatz wave function , decreases more gradually with increasing system size in the presence of two - body repulsion than it does in the absence of the two - body interactions .",
    "the ed results thus indicate that in the thermodynamic limit the pfaffian - like ansatz wave function most closely corresponds to the exact ground - state wave function of the system at some finite value of the two - body interaction strength . this might be close to the value where the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from the superfluid state to the mott insulating state , as previously found within the bosonization approach @xcite .",
    "we also present preliminary evidence that these states support non - abelian excitations required for topological quantum computation .",
    "we further study the ground - state properties of the system for larger system sizes .",
    "motivated by the recent success of tensor network methods @xcite to numerically simulate a variety of strongly correlated models , we use the entangled - plaquette - state ( eps ) ansatz , also called the correlator - product - state ( cps ) ansatz , and the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method @xcite .",
    "in the eps approach , the lattice is covered with overlapping plaquettes and the ground - state wave function is written in terms of the plaquette coefficients .",
    "configurational weights are then optimized using a vmc algorithm . here",
    ", the plaquette coefficients that minimize the energy are found using the stochastic minimization method @xcite .",
    "for small system sizes we find that the eps and vmc calculation gives quite accurate estimates of the ground - state energy and the one - body and two - body correlation functions .    to examine the proximity of the ground state to the pfaffian - like ansatz for larger system sizes , we calculate the one - body and two - body correlation functions for the exact ground - state and the pfaffian - like ansatz wave functions and compare their asymptotic behavior .",
    "since the eps wave function gives quite accurate estimates of the correlations within any plaquette , we estimate the asymptotic behavior of the correlation functions from the values of the correlation functions for the lattice sites within a plaquette .",
    "we study the ground - state properties of the system for the system sizes @xmath1 and 60 sites .",
    "the results obtained within the eps and vmc approach are consistent with the ed results for smaller system sizes and with the results for vanishing two - body interaction strength obtained previously using variational matrix product states ( mpss ) .",
    "for the system size @xmath2 sites , the maximum system size that we have considered , the results indicate that at some finite value of the two - body interaction strength @xmath3 the exact ground - state wave function is still very close to the pfaffian - like ansatz wave function .",

    "the system can be described by an effective hamiltonian for bosonic atoms with two- and three - body interactions .",
    "we have considered the limit of infinitely strong three - body interactions for a range of values of the two - body interaction strength .",
    "the ground - state properties of the system were calculated using the ed method for small system sizes , and the eps and vmc method for larger system sizes .",
    "the pfaffian - like ansatz was originally proposed as an ansatz for the ground - state wave function of the effective hamiltonian in the absence of two - body interactions .",
    "however , our results clearly demonstrated that the pfaffian - like ansatz wave function is a better ansatz for the ground - state wave function of the effective hamiltonian at some finite value of the two - body interaction strength .",
    "this value of the two - body interaction strength might be close to the value where the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from the superfluid state to the mott insulating state , as previously found within the bosonization approach .",

    "further work is necessary to find an experimentally realizable model with a ground - state wave function that can be even better approximated by the pfaffian - like ansatz wave function .",
    "this can possibly be achieved in a system with long - range interactions .",
    "an additional direction for future research is to consider similar 2d non - abelian models , for example , anisotropic systems consisting of coupled interacting 1d wires .",
    "such anisotropic 2d lattice models can have interesting non - abelian chern insulating phases and fractional topological insulating phases .    in order to use non - abelian states for quantum computation",
    ", one must be able to braid them .",
    "although this is not possible for a strictly 1d system , creating a network of such 1d systems connected by t - junctions , as suggested previously in the context of majorana quantum wires @xcite , potentially allows this . in the case of majorana quantum wires",
    "a t - junction @xcite allows for adiabatic exchange of two majorana fermions .",
    "such a t - junction has topological and non - topological regions that can be controlled by individually tunable gates . in principle ,",
    "similar t - junction networks can be created for the bosonic system that we have considered , where topological and nontopological regions of the network can be controlled by tuning the two - body interaction in different regions of the t - junction network ( for example , by changing the depth of the optical lattice in certain regions of the t - junction ) .    in a similar manner to fractional quantum hall states ,",
    "non - abelian anyons can be created by creating pairs of quasiholes , with one quasihole in each cluster @xcite .",
    "these non - abelian anyons are ising anyons [ su(2)@xmath107 anyons ] , similar to majorana fermions , and excitations of the @xmath210 fractional quantum hall state ( pfaffian state ) .",
    "we also note that braiding of su(2)@xmath107 anyons alone does not permit universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "however , to obtain a universal set of gates , braiding of su(2)@xmath107 anyons needs to be strengthened only by a single - qubit @xmath211 phase gate and a two - qubit measurement @xcite .",
    "also , pfaffian - like states obtained by symmetrization of two identical copies can be generalized to states obtained by symmetrization of @xmath169 identical copies that support su(2)@xmath212 anyons @xcite and can be used for universal quantum computation .",
