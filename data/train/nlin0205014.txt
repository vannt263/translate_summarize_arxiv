    "numerically it was found that on time scales longer than the ergodic time of the classical analogue , the fluctuations in the energy spectrum of a quantum system follow those of an appropriate ensemble of random matrices . for random matrices , the form factor @xmath5 , which is the fourier transform of the spectral two - point correlator , is @xmath6 for systems with time - reversal symmetry ( tr ) , or @xmath7 for systems without time - reversal symmetry ( ntr ) @xcite .",

    "berry @xcite explained that this universality arises from the combined contributions of the huge number of ergodic pos .",

    "( [ kgue ] ) happens to be exactly reproduced by the diagonal approximation for @xmath8 .",
    "currently we only know how to go beyond the diagonal approximation in a few special cases .",
    "in @xcite it was shown , that for uniformly hyperbolic and time - reversal invariant billiards on surfaces with constant negative curvature the second - order contribution @xmath9 is related to correlations within pairs of orbits differing in the orientation of one of the two loops resulting from a self - intersection of the orbit .",
    "we went on to derive the same result for a large family of quantum graphs @xcite with ergodic classical dynamics , in particular our result was _ not _ restricted to uniformly hyperbolic dynamics @xcite . a subsequent study @xcite indicated that the mechanism generating the contribution @xmath10 also works for systems with antiunitary symmetries other than simple time - reversal .",
    "given these results it is a plausible conjecture that in analogy to disordered systems @xcite the terms in the power series expansion of @xmath5 can be identified with the contributions of orbit pairs generated by more and more self - intersections . in the present paper",
    "we will explore this idea for a particular model system : extending our recent paper @xcite we will calculate the form factor up to order @xmath11 for a particular family quantum graphs .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section 2 we define our model and explain how the form factor can be expressed as a double sum over periodic orbits . in section 3 this sum is rewritten in terms of diagrams , representing all orbits with a given number and topology of self - intersections .",

    "the double - counting in this particular instance was caused by the permutation @xmath151 $ ] which swaps around arcs @xmath152 and @xmath153 and produces a pair @xmath154 and @xmath155 , which is identical to @xmath64 up to a shift . however the restriction @xmath156 that we introduced on tr3a is _ not _ symmetric with respect to this permutation . for the orbits satisfying @xmath157 and @xmath158 this does not present any problems .",

    "note that some of the restrictions are superfluous since they refer to orbits that are already excluded .",

    ", we must subtract the contribution of the ntr3b diagram with two self - retracing arcs , as discussed in section  [ sect : doublecountii ] .",
    "we use the fact that long self - retracing arcs give only exponentially small corrections because the number of free summation variables is reduced by a factor of two .",

    "then the sum over @xmath228 results in a factor of @xmath243 and , combining this with the restriction @xmath244 , we find that the contribution of this case is identically zero .",
    "thus the ntr diagrams contribute nothing to the form factor of tr - systems .       and",
    "@xmath245 , the intersection can be redrawn ( as on the right ) as more than one intersections . in this case",
    "there are three intersections , one 2-intersection , one 3-intersection and one 4-intersection , the latter two being at the same vertex .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    one may speculate that the arguments given in the previous subsection admit a straightforward generalization to higher - order diagrams .",
    "given an @xmath246th - order diagram , we impose the following restriction on each of its intersections @xmath247 where the product is over the set of all arcs leaving the intersection .",

    "as soon as @xmath249 at least one arc must be long . if arc @xmath77 is long then @xmath250 and the sum over @xmath82 generates a @xmath237-function . combining this @xmath237-function with the restriction at the vertex produces zero .    to justify the choice of the restriction ( [ eq : gen_restrictions ] ) for any intersection , we notice that if any two bonds leaving the vertex are the same , the intersection can be rearranged as a group of more than one intersection , each satisfying the above restriction .",
    "an example of such rearrangement is presented in fig .",

    "the above restriction thereby helps to prevent double counting of orbits with tangential intersections .",
    "this argument essentially shows that the contribution of all @xmath246th - order diagrams is zero in the ntr case .",

    "unfortunately we found pairs of orbits that violate both parts of this statement .",
    "these counterexamples seem to be `` rare '' , in the sense that the sum of their contributions vanish as @xmath33 , however a rigourous proof of this observation remains an open problem .",

    "evaluating @xmath251 for a general class of graphs is a complicated and tedious task @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the calculation simplifies considerably for a special case described below . in this section",
    "we restrict our attention to fully - connected graphs with @xmath13 vertices and @xmath252 directed bonds , including a loop at each of the vertices .",
    "an example with @xmath253 is shown in fig .",
    "we assume that the vertex - scattering matrices are @xmath254 for all @xmath16 .",

    "the corresponding matrix @xmath36 represents uniform scattering at the vertex , @xmath256 and thus the probability to get from @xmath257 to @xmath258 in @xmath39 step is @xmath259 it is also useful to have an expression for @xmath260 , the probability to get from @xmath257 to @xmath261 following only self - retracing paths .",

    "thus we can only get a non - zero contribution when arc 4 is the only ergodic path",
    ". however , we argue in section  [ sect : estimates ] that we need at least two arcs to be long ( ergodic ) since otherwise the contribution can be neglected .",
    "thus the non - zero contribution discussed above will only give a small correction which will vanish in the limit @xmath277 .",
    "the two restrictions @xmath180 and @xmath181 do not change the above argument at all , so we have ignored them .",
    "we conclude that @xmath278      here we calculate the contributions of orbits with the topology of tr3b which obey the conditions @xmath279 , @xmath280 , @xmath281 and @xmath186 .",

    "in this section we discuss a rule for finding all diagrams which contribute to the @xmath246th order in the small @xmath0 expansion of the form factor .",
    "the rule is @xmath333 thus for @xmath334 , we need only one diagram which is @xmath335 in the format ( @xmath336of arcs , @xmath336of intersections ) , and this is the contribution we considered in @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in @xmath248 , so we must consider both @xmath337 and @xmath338 .",
    "it is these diagrams that we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    to get the rule ( [ eq : rule ] ) we count powers of @xmath14 in a diagram s contribution . equations ( [ eq : ff - po - ntr ] ) and ( [ eq : ff - po - tr ] ) have a prefactor of @xmath221 so a @xmath339-contribution to the form factor must get @xmath340 from the summation over the orbits . in the ergodic limit , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ergodic - tau ] ) , each arc will contribute the weight @xmath221 , while each intersection contributes the weight @xmath14 , thus we have eq .",
    "( [ eq : rule ] ) .",
    "the origin of the factor of @xmath14 associated with each intersection can be explained as follows .",
    "first of all , the set of all vertices @xmath341 adjacent to an intersection point @xmath167 can be split into two equal subsets satisfying the following property : if there is a transition @xmath342 in either @xmath53 or @xmath62 then @xmath343 and @xmath344 belong to different subsets .",
    "this is particularly simple for the ntr3 diagrams where the two sets are simply @xmath345 and @xmath346 .",
    "if we now do the summation over all vertices in one subset and invoke the unitarity of the scattering matrix at the vertex @xmath167 , the result will be a product of @xmath237-functions @xmath347 where @xmath348 are the vertices from the second subset , ordered in an appropriate way .",
    "now the summation over @xmath349 will give 1 while the summation over @xmath350 and @xmath167 will give the sought - after factor of @xmath14 , since the only restriction on @xmath350 and @xmath167 is that they have to be two ends of the same bond .    to make this recipe work for the diagonal term ( @xmath351 ) , the corresponding diagram being just a looping arc , we need one extra ingredient , the starting vertex for the loop .",
    "the position of the vertex is not determined , it can be placed anywhere on the looping arc , unlike the intersection points in other diagrams . to compensate for this ambiguity",
    "when we sum over all periodic orbits fitting such diagram , we divide the sum by the number of vertices in the loop , @xmath39 .",
    "now we discuss why counting of powers of @xmath39 does _ not _",
    "work for obtaining eq .",
    "( [ eq : rule ] ) .",
    "let us estimate the order of @xmath39 for a given diagram .",
    "firstly , there is @xmath352 in the prefactor of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff - po - ntr ] ) or ( [ eq : ff - po - tr ] ) .",
    "secondly , for a diagram with @xmath265 arcs , the lengths @xmath78 of arcs satisfy @xmath353 thus the sum over all possible @xmath78 gives a factor proportional to @xmath354 .",
    "then of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , ntr3b and tr3c appear to have four powers of @xmath39 while the rest have five .",
    "similarly , the diagram we evaluated in @xcite gets three powers of @xmath39 .",
    "the leading contributions to all the diagrams appear to have at least one more power of @xmath39 than they should is right , which explains why advancing beyond the diagonal approximation was ( and still is ) so hard . ] .",
    "however , we show in @xcite and the present article that the numerical coefficient of this `` out of order '' term is zero  at least for diagrams contributing up to third order in @xmath0 .",
    "the arguments given above in favour of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rule ] ) are certainly too vague to be considered a proof .",
    "in particular , we can not presently check our assumption that terms giving incorrectly large powers in @xmath39 disappear also for more complicated diagrams .",
    "however , summing rigorously the contributions of all the diagrams obtained from this set of rules we show _ a posteriori _ that we indeed get an expansion which depends only on the scaled time @xmath0 .",
    "we also take confidence in our method from the fact that our rule generates the same diagrams that were used in perturbative calculations of the form factor for disordered systems with the non - linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , counting powers of @xmath39 is very useful in the following situation : if for some reason the lengths of some arcs are forced to be fixed , the estimated power of @xmath39 can drop low enough that we can safely ignore the contribution of such a diagram in the @xmath277 limit without actually evaluating it . in particular , we see that to get a non - vanishing contribution of order @xmath12 , at least two arcs in any diagram must have unrestricted lengths . note that this does _ not _ mean that there is no contribution from orbit pairs where the maximum length of all arcs is restricted . for any given @xmath14 and @xmath39",
    "there are orbit pairs with so many self - intersections that the maximum arc length is less than the time required for ergodicity .",
    "then the method discussed in this paper must fail , this may explain why the power series expansion in @xmath0 breaks down at @xmath355 for ntr ( and at @xmath356 for tr ) despite the fact that the po sums eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ff - po - ntr ] ) , ( [ eq : ff - po - tr ] ) are exact .",
    "at first sight , the achievements of the present paper may appear moderate .",
    "what is the point in going from second to third order in a series which is infinite , in particular if this step becomes possible only by restricting the range of systems considered to very special models ? but we believe that such a point of view is too short - sighted .",
    "semiclassical theories are obviously indispensable for a complete understanding of spectral statistics in systems with chaotic classical dynamics .",
    "as they are not based on a random matrix conjecture , such theories have the potential to account for important system - specific corrections which one can hope to extract once the emergence of universality within semiclassics is fully understood .",
    "on the other hand , the restriction to the diagonal approximation has so far severely limited the success of the semiclassical approach .",
    "going beyond the diagonal approximation in semiclassical po theories is possible , as demonstrated by sieber and richter @xcite .",
    "but when more than a first - order correction is required , one will inevitably encounter the problems discussed in this paper .",
    "for example , one needs methods to select diagrams contributing at a given order , and we suggested a solution in section  [ sect : estimates ] .",
    "it will be necessary to account for the ambiguity introduced by the representation of the form factor in terms of diagrams , and we have solved this problem at least in quantum graphs for the diagrams which contribute up to third order ( section  [ sect : doublecountii ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that a variety of orbits give the relevant contributions , and our calculations in section  [ sect : sum_tr3 ] indicate that the generalization of the leading - order correction to higher orders can not be achieved by considering a single type of diagram only .    here",
    "the third - order result for tr systems is limited to a class of uniformly hyperbolic quantum graphs .",
    "however , we have no reason to believe that any conclusion will be substantially changed when the calculation is done for a more generic model as , e.  g. ,  in @xcite . while going further than third order for tr - systems is beyond us at the moment , the prospects for doing this in ntr - systems are more promising .",

    "<S> we consider the contributions from pairs of periodic orbits represented by diagrams with up to two self - intersections connected by up to four arcs and explain why all other diagrams are expected to give higher - order corrections only .    for a large family of graphs with ergodic classical dynamics the diagrams that exist in the absence of time - reversal symmetry sum to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism for this cancellation is rather general which suggests that it also applies at higher orders in the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> this expectation is in full agreement with the fact that in this case the linear-@xmath0 contribution , the diagonal approximation , already reproduces the random matrix form factor for @xmath1 .    for systems with time - reversal symmetry there are more diagrams which contribute at third order . </S>",
    "<S> we sum these contributions for quantum graphs with uniformly hyperbolic dynamics , obtaining @xmath2 , in agreement with random matrix theory . as in the previous calculation of the leading - order correction to the diagonal approximation </S>",
    "<S> we find that the third order contribution can be attributed to exceptional orbits representing the intersection of diagram classes .    </S>",
