    "in order to explain the homeopolar chemical bond in the hydrogen molecule , heitler and london @xcite have derived the direct and exchange coulomb integrals which can be written in the following form : @xmath2 and @xmath3 where _ i _ and _ j _ are site indexes , and @xmath4 is a wave function centered at the lattice site _",
    "i_. taking into account the exchange coulomb integral allows one to obtain bonding ( @xmath5 ) as well as antibonding ( @xmath6 ) states of h@xmath0 .",
    "heitler and london have shown that the properties of the hydrogen molecule can be described correctly using these combinations of wave functions .",
    "then , in 1928 , heisenberg @xcite has used the exchange coulomb integral @xmath7 to explain ferromagnetism .",
    "heisenberg has supposed that this exchange coulomb integral corresponds to the exchange coupling in a spin model defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath8 and that it is the main source of ferromagnetism in 3d metal compounds .",
    "however , if @xmath4 in eq.(1 ) is the atomic wave function centered on the @xmath9 atom , then the overlap between wave functions on neighboring atoms is negligibly small .",
    "therefore the exchange interaction derived through eq.(2 ) can be neglected .    in 1959 ,",
    "anderson @xcite has suggested a new type of exchange interaction process based on hopping ( kinetic exchange interaction ) . in the context of the hubbard model ,",
    "@xcite @xmath10 this exchange interaction can be expressed as @xmath11 .",
    "this estimation of exchange interaction through hopping integrals is convenient and now widely used in the literature .",
    "however , if @xmath12 is small enough , other sources of exchange coupling become important .",
    "indeed , the proper way to discuss exchange is to consider the basis of wannier functions @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the composite index of band and site ) proposed by wannier @xcite in 1937 and defined as the fourier transforms of a certain linear combination of bloch functions @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the band index and @xmath17 is the wave - vector in reciprocal space ) .",
    "in contrast to atomic wave functions @xmath4 , which are localized on one atom , the wannier functions @xmath18 are more extended in space and can be expressed through linear combination atomic wave functions , @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the contribution of the _ j_th atomic orbital to wannier function @xmath18 and @xmath21 is a translation vector ) .",
    "the wannier functions are the most localized ones within the subspace of low - energy excitations , which facilitates a direct physical interpretation consistent with interacting localized spins .",
    "therefore , to use wannier states instead of atomic sets is physically motivated .",
    "in particular , as we shall see , @xmath7 defined in the wannier basis plays a crucial role in the description of exchange interactions between magnetic moments in the case of nearly 90@xmath1 metal - oxygen - metal bonds .",
    "these questions have already been discussed in several context in the literature .",
    "for instance , the authors of ref . have discussed two alternative ways , natural or orthogonalized magnetic orbitals , to describe the exchange interactions . they have concluded that the orthogonalized magnetic orbital approach clearly leads to simpler calculations and thus may be more appropriate for quantitative computations .",
    "the competition between kinetic ( @xmath12 ) and potential ( @xmath7 ) contributions to the total exchange interaction has been considered before in many works . in ref . , the authors have performed model calculations of a cu@xmath0o@xmath22li@xmath23 cluster for different cu - o - cu angles .",
    "their computational experiments have shown that the nearest - neighbor interaction reaches a maximum around 97@xmath1 and remains ferromagnetic up to angles as large as 104@xmath1 .",
    "they have also concluded that the simple superexchange relation can not be applied to li@xmath0cuo@xmath0 . in ref . , it was shown that unusual insulating ferromagnetism in la@xmath23ba@xmath0cu@xmath0o@xmath24 can be explained by intersite ferromagnetic `` direct exchange '' ( in our notation @xmath7 ) .",
    "the authors have concluded that the latter process occurs mainly at la and o sites and overwhelms the af superexchange j@xmath25 .",
    "the value of j@xmath26 was calculated through a direct integration over the wave functions .    in the present paper",
    ", we revisit this issue in the context of constrained lda and lsda+u _ ab - initio _ approaches .",
    "the problem we want to address can be formulated as follows . in favourable situations , the exchange integrals calculated",
    "using lsda+u agree quite well with the standard superexchange expression @xmath11 if the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 are themselves determined from constrained lda and lsda+u .",
    "such an interpretation of the lsda+u results is a well accepted criterion to test the reliability of the result .",
    "but the standard superexchange expression @xmath11 often fails quantitatively , and even sometimes qualitatively , to reproduce the lsda+u results .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to provide for such cases a generalization of the superexchange expression which is entirely expressed in terms of parameters that can be determined by constrained lda and lsad+u , and which can be used as an interpretation and an independent check of the lsda+u results .    to this end , we start from the standard hamiltonian in wannier function basis for nearly 90@xmath1 metal - oxygen - metal bond .",
    "we show how the different coulomb interaction terms of this hamiltonian are related to parameters defined in the atomic basis set , with emphasis on the intraatomic exchange interaction of oxygen , j@xmath29 , to which @xmath7 is proportional when neighboring wannier orbitals overlap on the oxygen atoms .",
    "we then present a simple expression for the exchange interactions between magnetic moments in the system .",
    "the parameters that enter this expression can themselves be estimated through lda and lsda+u calculations .",
    "this formalism is applied to the investigation of the magnetic properties of licu@xmath0o@xmath0 , and the results are compared to those of first - principle lsda+u approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the hubbard model in wannier function basis . in section iii",
    "a , we shortly describe the crystal structure of licu@xmath0o@xmath0 and present the results of lda calculation . in section iii b , we present the results of lsda+u calculations and discuss the exchange interactions obtained between different pairs of magnetic moments in licu@xmath0o@xmath0 . in section iv , we briefly summarize our results .",
    "the general hamiltonian in wannier function basis @xmath18 can be written in the following form : @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32    we analyze the complex hamiltonian of eq.(5 ) in the context of a 3-site model ( see fig.1 ) with nearly 90@xmath1 bonds and define two wannier orbitals @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which are constructed from the atomic wave functions : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( see fig.1 ) .",

    "it is easy to show that @xmath42 if @xmath37 and @xmath38 are eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian of eq.(5 ) , then using the orthogonality condition , one can obtain the following expression for the hopping term : @xmath43 clearly , if @xmath44 , the hopping integral vanishes .    in the analysis of the coulomb term of eq.(5 ) that follows , we consider only density - density terms and on - site exchange integrals . on - site",
    "coulomb interaction , intersite coulomb interaction and intersite exchange interaction in wannier function basis are expressed through the corresponding parameters in the atomic basis set : @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the on - site coulomb interaction of 3d atom , @xmath49 is the on - site coulomb interaction of oxygen atom , @xmath50 is the coulomb interaction between 3d atom and oxygen , @xmath51 is the coulomb interaction between 3d atoms , @xmath52 is the intraatomic exchange interaction of oxygen atom .",
    "it was shown in ref . that the following term : @xmath53 which is the so - called correlated hybridization , could significantly change the parameters in the effective single band model for transition metal oxides .",
    "however we do not consider it here and leave that point for further investigation .",
    "finally one can write the following hamiltonian in wannier function basis @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the particle number operator , while @xmath56 and @xmath57 are components of the spin operator . one can reduce eq.(19 ) to the following form : @xmath58 where the effective on - site coulomb interaction is given by @xmath59 and the effective intersite coulomb interaction by @xmath60 .",
    "it is easy to show that the heisenberg model which corresponds to this electronic hamiltonian has the following form : @xmath61 where @xmath62 . in the case of a nearly 90@xmath1 metal - oxygen - metal bond ( fig.1 )",
    ", there is an additional ferromagnetic contribution to the total exchange interaction .",
    "the origin of this term is hund s rule exchange interaction on the oxygen atom . as we show below",
    ", the value of @xmath63 is not negligible : it can fully compensate the kinetic contribution , so that the total exchange interaction becomes ferromagnetic .    if @xmath64=0 , then the hamiltonian of eq.(20 ) is the simple hubbard model .",
    "the coulomb parameters of the general hamiltonian of eq.(20 ) can be calculated through constrained lda calculations or direct integration over the wave functions . in this paper",
    "we use the constrained lda calculation approach , @xcite which has given reasonable results for a number of compounds .",
    "we apply the analysis of this section to the investigation of exchange interactions in licu@xmath0o@xmath0 .",
    "licu@xmath0o@xmath0 ( fig.2 ) is a good example to demonstrate the competition between coulomb @xmath7 and kinetic @xmath12 exchange interactions .",
    "indeed , the angle of cu - o - cu bond in this compound is equal to 94@xmath1 .",
    "this value of the angle corresponds to the middle of the ferromagnetic range,@xcite and the nearest - neighbor hopping is considerably suppressed ( see eq.(9 ) ) .",

    "none of the sets of parameters is in good agreement with the results of refs . .",
    "one can conclude that , at present , there is no consistent theoretical and experimental description of the magnetic properties of licu@xmath0o@xmath0 .    in the present paper , the electronic structure calculation of licu@xmath0o@xmath0",
    "was performed using the tight binding linear - muffin - tin - orbital atomic sphere approximation ( tb - lmto - asa ) method in terms of the conventional local - density approximation @xcite and crystal structure data from ref . .",

    "the partial density of states of licu@xmath0o@xmath0 obtained from lda calculations is presented in fig.[dos3dlda ] .",
    "copper 3d states of @xmath68 symmetry are strongly hybridized with oxygen 2p states . therefore it is more natural to use the wannier function basis rather than atomic orbitals to describe the hybridization processes in licu@xmath0o@xmath0 .",
    "we have used the projection procedure @xcite which is more accurate than the fitting procedure used in ref . because the wannier states in the former method are constructed from all electron dft orbitals .",
    "the resulting wannier orbitals of licu@xmath0o@xmath0 , each centered at one cu site , are shown in fig.5 .",
    "one can see that the wannier orbitals strongly overlap at oxygen and cu@xmath66 atoms .    as we mentioned above , one of the possible microscopic mechanisms of exchange interaction",
    "is hubbard - like af superexchange .",
    "this interaction comes from hopping processes .",
    "we have calculated the hopping integrals between orbitals of x@xmath69-y@xmath69 symmetry in the wannier function basis ( table i ) .",
    ".calculated values of hopping parameters @xmath27 between @xmath68 orbitals of copper atoms for the one - orbital model and estimated exchange interaction parameters using eq.(22 ) ( in mev ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to calculate the other magnetic interactions , we have implemented the green s function method .",
    "@xcite according to this method , we determine the exchange interaction parameter between copper atoms via the second variation of the total energy with respect to small deviations of the magnetic moments from the collinear magnetic configuration .",
    "the exchange interaction parameters j@xmath70 for the heisenberg model ( eq.(3 ) ) with s=@xmath71 can be written in the following form : @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) is the magnetic quantum number , the on - site potential @xmath77 and the green s function is calculated in the following way @xmath78 here @xmath79 is a component of the _ n_th eigenstate , and e@xmath80 is the corresponding eigenvalue .    our results are summarized in table iii .",
    "one can see that lsda+u results are in good agreement with those obtained in our model analysis ( see previous section ) and disagree with previous theoretical estimates .",
    "@xcite this agreement between the model analysis and lsda+u results is very encouraging , but clearly the ultimate test is to compare them with experiments .    in that respect",
    "as well , the present results are a clear improvement with respect to previous estimates .",
    "indeed , in contrast to results of paper ref . , the ratio between the strongest couplings @xmath81 = -0.5 is in good agreement with the results of the neutron scattering experiments of ref . .",
    "this ratio is very important since it controls the pitch vector @xmath82 of the helimagnetic state of licu@xmath0o@xmath0 .",
    "the agreement is not perfect however : our estimates are about twice larger than the integrals deduced from experiments .",
    "interestingly enough , it is possible , using the simple microscopic model eq.(22 ) , to identify the source of discrepancy between lsda+u and experimental results .",
    "indeed , the second term of eq.(22 ) is very sensitive to the choice of @xmath83 .",
    "for example , @xmath83=0.08 leads to @xmath84 = -18.5 mev , which is in excellent agreement with lsda+u results . for @xmath85=0.65 and @xmath83=0.06 , we obtain the following set of model exchange interactions : @xmath84=-10 mev , @xmath86= 5 mev , @xmath87=2.3 mev , @xmath88=0.6 mev , @xmath89=0.4 mev and @xmath90=0.5 mev .",
    "these model magnetic couplings are in good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "this proves the sensitivity of the results to the precise form of the wannier functions .",
    "now , it is well known that several sets of localized functions can be used to described a given band , @xcite and the question of which wannier functions should be used in the case of the determination of magnetic exchange , a point already raised by anderson a long time ago , @xcite has not been settled yet .",
    "the present results call for further investigation of that issue .    another possible way however to improve the agreement between theory and experiment could be the following . from the experimental point of view",
    ", licu@xmath0o@xmath0 has spiral magnetic order in the ground state .",
    "our study was performed for collinear magnetic configurations .",
    "therefore , it would be more natural to calculate the exchange couplings using the magnetic structure observed experimentally .",
    "this goes beyond the scope of the present paper however .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented an analysis of the hubbard model in the case of nearly 90@xmath1 metal - oxygen - metal bonds dealing explicitly with wannier orbitals .",
    "this has allowed us to derive an explicit expression of exchange integrals entirely in terms of parameters that can obtained from constrained lda and lsda+u .",
    "this expression can serve to interpret lsda+u _ ab initio _ estimates of the exchange integrals , and to establish their reliability .",
    "the analysis has been applied to the investigation of the magnetic couplings of licu@xmath0o@xmath0 , allowing us to reach qualitative agreement with experiments , and to gain insight into the nature of exchange in that system .",
    "because of the formation of a strongly hybridized , and energetically isolated combination of @xmath91 and 2p orbitals , a large moment is transferred to the o ions , and the magnetization of oxygen atoms has been proven to be the main source of ferromagnetism in licu@xmath0o@xmath0 .",
