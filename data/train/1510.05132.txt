    "the present work proposes a detailed account of the _ tensor tomography problem _ ( ttp ) on the euclidean unit disk in fan - beam coordinates , including inversion procedures ( modulo kernel ) and full range description of the operator over tensors of arbitrary order .",
    "the tensor tomography problem , posed on a non - trapping riemannian surface @xmath0 , consists of ( i ) determining what part of a symmetric @xmath1-covariant tensor @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is reconstructible from knowledge of its geodesic x - ray transform ( xrt ) @xmath4 ( the collection of its integrals along all geodesics passing through that surface ) , and ( ii ) how to reconstruct a faithful representative of @xmath2 from @xmath4 modulo the kernel of @xmath5 .",
    "such a problem arises for its applications to imaging sciences as well as for its ties to integral geometric problems such as spectral and boundary rigidity , and caldern s inverse conductivity problem .",
    "particular applications are computerized tomography ( @xmath6 ) , ultrasound doppler tomography ( @xmath7 , see @xcite ) , deformation boundary rigidity ( @xmath8 , see @xcite ) and imaging of elastic media with slightly anisotropic properties ( @xmath9 , see @xcite ) .    regarding question ( i ) , for any @xmath10 , this problem is famously non - injective , as the _ inner derivative _ operator @xmath11 ( see @xcite for details ) generates an element in the kernel of the xrt out of any symmetric tensor vanishing at the boundary of @xmath12 . in this regard ,",
    "a way of reformulating question ( i ) is to ask whether these elements are the only ones in the kernel , a question which received positive answers in the case of surfaces of revolution satisfying herglotz condition in @xcite ( in fact , all dimensions @xmath13 there ) , and in the case of _ simple ) with boundary is called _ simple _ if it has no conjugate points and its boundary is strictly convex . ]",
    "surfaces _ in @xcite .",
    "neither case is a subset of the other though both cover the euclidean disk , studied in the present article .",
    "let us mention that further dynamical tools have recently allowed results on cases with trapped geometry @xcite , fourier analysis and representation theory have led to progress on radon transforms on compact lie groups and finite groups @xcite , and microlocal analytic approaches have led to results on general manifolds with conjugate points @xcite .    on studying question ( ii ) , the solenoidal - potential decomposition of an @xmath1 tensor @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 an @xmath16 tensor vanishing on @xmath17 ) ,",
    "true for any @xmath18 tensor @xmath2 and where each summand is continuous in terms of @xmath2 , suggests that , since @xmath19 , the `` solenoidal '' tensor @xmath20 is a good candidate as a representative to be reconstructed from data @xmath4 . in this direction , sharafutdinov provided a reconstruction of @xmath20 in euclidean free space in any dimension in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.12.2 ) , kazantsev and bukhgeim proposed in @xcite a reconstruction algorithm for a tensor of arbitrary order in the case of the euclidean unit disk , see also @xcite for further works on the topic and the recent work @xcite .",
    "another approach is to make use of the theory of a - analytic functions _",
    " la _ bukhgeim , which has successfully led to range characterizations and inversion formulas , most recently in @xcite for the ray transform in euclidean convex domains over functions , vector fields and two - tensors , including attenuation coefficients .",
    "the solenoidal representative is arguably not an easy quantity to work with : sharafutdinov s formulas involve iterated use of the non - local operator @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes componentwise laplacian , and the expression of @xmath23 depends on the tensor order .",
    "a first salient feature of this paper is to exploit another decomposition , arising naturally for instance when performing fourier analysis on tangent fibers : doing this comes with a different inner product structure than the one traditionally used on tensor fields , and in particular , this motivates another tensor decomposition than the solenoidal - potential one .",
    "this decomposition has proved to be more natural in earlier contexts such as the search for conformal killing tensor fields ( see for instance @xcite or ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.5 ) ) . here",
    "we exploit this other decomposition to provide , for any tensor field , an element to be reconstructed with some advantages : its fourier components are made up of a function to be inverted for via `` traditional '' inverse x - ray transform , plus additional terms which can be easily expressed in terms of analytic functions , the reconstruction of which via _ ad hoc _ cauchy integrals is straighforward and efficient ; in addition , the x - ray transforms of each component live on @xmath18-orthogonal subpaces of data space , and the reconstruction formulas given below encode projection onto each subspace before reconstruction , without requiring intermediate processing . in the case of tensors of odd order",
    ", special care is given to the reconstruction of solenoidal one - forms supported up to the boundary , for which inversions in @xcite only covered the case of compactly supported ones .",
    "some numerical reconstructions are presented at the end of the article .",
    "we also briefly discuss the fact that the decomposition presented requires choosing a `` central frequency '' , the choice of which may also yield other decompositions whose reconstruction would be equally fast to implement .    as a second feature of this article , understanding the behavior of data space under this decomposition",
    "has also shed some light on the range characterization of the xrt over functions ( call it @xmath24 for the case @xmath6 ) in fan - beam coordinates .",
    "more specifically , we prove an equivalence between a range characterization of @xmath24 given by pestov and uhlmann in @xcite on simple riemannian surfaces , and the classical moment conditions due to gelfand and graev @xcite and helgason and ludwig @xcite , translated into fan - beam coordinates .",
    "the latter conditions can also be regarded as countably many algebraic conditions characterizing the range of @xmath24 over functions in the so - called parallel geometry .",
    "translating these conditions into fan - beam coordinates has been and continues to be an object of active study @xcite , in particular for their many applications to the imaging modalities of computerized tomography and positron emission tomography : motion artifact reduction as in , e.g. , @xcite ; consistent extrapolation of truncated data as in , e.g. , @xcite ; monitoring of ct systems for faulty detector channels @xcite ; see also the detailed introduction in @xcite on the matter . in the present article ,",
    "we show that another range characterization provided in @xcite is _ equivalent _ to the moment conditions for functions with compact support .",
    "additionally , appropriate boundary operators ( some of them , labelled as @xmath25 first appearing in @xcite ; others to be introduced below , found by the author ) allow to enforce in a fast way _ all _ moment conditions simultaneously .",
    "such operators involve the interplay between the scattering relation and the hilbert transform on the tangent circles at the boundary of @xmath12 .",
    "it is the author s hope that such an equivalence bridges a gap between the two systems of coordinates and offers a new viewpoint on the x - ray transform and the moment conditions in fan - beam coordinates , whose theoretical focus in the euclidean setting is often shifted to parallel coordinates .",
    "this is because parallel geometry , unlike fan - beam , enjoys the central slice theorem , which allows for a deeper understanding of discretization issues and regularization theory via accurate and efficient convolution methods in data space @xcite .",
    "this progress in fan - beam coordinates is partly motivated by the fact that dealing with such coordinates becomes almost unavoidable when considering the ttp on riemannian surfaces without symmetries .",
    "finally , the expliciteness of the present results owes much to the fact that the scattering relation on a euclidean disk admits a very explicit expression , thereby simplifying the description of the action of the boundary operators mentioned above .",
    "a generalization of these results to simple riemannian surfaces is currently under study and will appear in future work .",
    "we now discuss the main results and give an outline of the remainder of the article .",

    "one traditionally defines the ray transform of @xmath74 as the integral along this curve of @xmath74 paired @xmath1 times with the speed vector @xmath75 .",
    "this amounts to integrating the following function on @xmath73 along said curve , in one - to - one correspondence with the tensor @xmath74 @xmath76 this function can then be uniquely represented in the fourier decomposition in @xmath36 solely in terms of the following harmonics @xmath77 for convenience , we still call such elements @xmath1-tensors and define @xmath78 the subspace of @xmath1-tensors in @xmath79 . in this identification , we have the following correspondences @xmath80 , and for @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 : hodge star operator ) . in particular , the helmholtz - hodge decomposition of one - forms reads as follows : a function @xmath85 of the form @xmath86 decomposes uniquely in the form @xmath87    * main results . *",
