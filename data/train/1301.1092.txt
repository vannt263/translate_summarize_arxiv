    "topological insulators are a new class of materials that attract much interest recently.@xcite they are band insulating in the bulk but conducting along the surface due to the gapless surface state . in three - dimensional strong topological insulators ,",
    "the surface state involves an odd number of massless dirac cones in the surface brillouin zone and is protected by time - reversal invariance.@xcite for the simplest case with a single dirac cone , such as on the surface of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , sb@xmath0te@xmath1 and bi@xmath0te@xmath1,@xcite the surface state near the dirac cone can be described by the rashba spin - orbit coupling@xcite and hence exhibits helicity.@xcite the metallic and helical surface state has been proposed to have much potential for the application in spintronics.@xcite    the spin helicity of surface state in topological insulators has been experimentally measured by spin - angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy.@xcite however , it has not been clearly evidenced by the electrical transport experiment .",
    "this might be caused by the difficulty in seperating the bulk and surface conduction as both of them are usually involved simultaneously , and also the influence of the stray field from the ferromagnetic electrode when the spins are injected via the ferromagnetic contact .",
    "to overcome these circumvents and confirm the spin - momentum locking in the topological surface state , a scheme of transport experiment by injecting spin polarized electrons into the topological surface state via silicon has been proposed very recently.@xcite in spite of the experimental difficulties , the understanding of charge and spin transport on the surface of topological insulators is necessary .",
    "in fact , theoretically , this issue has been preliminarily studied , with electric field being small ( @xmath20.1  kv / cm,@xcite under which the electrons are near equilibrium ) , the fermi level located deep enough in the conduction band and the fully occupied valence band being irrelevant.@xcite moreover , even in the microscopic study based on kinetic equations by culcer _",
    "_ , only the electron - impurity scattering is considered.@xcite the electron - phonon scattering , which can be very important,@xcite and also the electron - electron coulomb scattering are not incorporated .",
    "it is revealed that in the presence of driving by the electric field or diffusion by the density gradient , a transverse spin polarization is induced due to the spin - momentum locking,@xcite with the magnitude proportional to the electric field and momentum scattering time.@xcite besides , due to the spin - momentum locking again , the spin polarization relaxes in a time scale of momentum scattering in the absence of an electric field.@xcite    the transport on the surface of topological insulators under large electric fields ( @xmath21  kv / cm ) , which can drive the carriers far away from the equilibrium,@xcite has been rarely investigated so far .",
    "here we perform this study on the surface of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 by means of the kinetic spin bloch equation ( ksbe ) approach,@xcite with the electric field up to several kv / cm .",
    "bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is expected to have a 300 mev direct band gap at the zone center@xcite and is usually @xmath3-type due to the charged se vacancies .",
    "however , the electron density can be adjusted by counterdoping with ca@xcite or partially substituting bi with sb to reduce se vacancies.@xcite particularly , employing cd doping in combination with a se - rich growth condition , even a @xmath4-type bi@xmath0se@xmath1 can be obtained.@xcite for the thin - layer structure with a thickness @xmath210  nm , the electron density is also controllable by the gate voltage.@xcite due to the large relative static dielectric constant,@xcite the dominant scattering on the surface is the electron - surface optical phonon scattering.@xcite    in this work , we take into account both the @xmath3-doped degenerate and intrinsic nondegenerate cases before turning on the electric field , by including both the conduction and valence bands .",
    "our study reveals that due to the joint effects of the driving of the electric field and the inter - band precession as well as inter - band electron - phonon scattering , electrons can be transferred from the valence band to the conduction one .",
    "this effect is more pronounced when the scattering is weak and the electric field is strong .",
    "moreover , the variation in electron density for each band is linear in the electric field when the latter is strong for both the @xmath3-doped and intrinsic cases .",
    "the induced spin polarization is linear in the electric field when the latter is small and deviates from the linear relation when the latter becomes large enough .",
    "besides , at high temperature , the induced spin polarization is sensitive to the temperature but insensitive to the electron density .",
    "we also find that the electron - electron coulomb scattering is too weak to establish a drifted fermi distribution with a unified hot - electron temperature under the electric field . after turning off the electric field , the hot carriers cool down in a time scale of 100 - 1000  ps while the spin polarization relaxes in a time scale of momentum scattering , which is of the order of 0.01 - 0.1  ps .",

    "<S> we study the charge and spin transport under high electric field ( up to several kv / cm ) on the surface of topological insulator bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , where the electron - surface optical phonon scattering dominates except at very low temperature . due to the spin mixing of conduction and valence bands , the electric field </S>",
    "<S> not only accelerates electrons in each band , but also leads to inter - band precession . in the presence of the electric field </S>",
    "<S> , electrons can transfer from the valence band to the conduction one via the inter - band precession and inter - band electron - phonon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the electron density in each band varies with the electric field linearly when the electric field is strong . due to the spin - momentum locking , a transverse spin polarization , with the magnitude proportional to the momentum scattering time , </S>",
    "<S> is induced by the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the induced spin polarization depends on the electric field linearly when the latter is small . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , its magnitude is inversely proportional to the temperature and is insensitive to the electron density at high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation also reveals that due to the large relative static dielectric constant , the coulomb scattering is too weak to establish a drifted fermi distribution with a unified hot - electron temperature in the steady state under the electric field . after turning off the electric field in the steady state , </S>",
    "<S> the hot carriers cool down in a time scale of energy relaxation which is very long ( of the order of 100 - 1000  ps ) while the spin polarization relaxes in a time scale of momentum scattering which is quite short ( of the order of 0.01 - 0.1  ps ) . </S>"
