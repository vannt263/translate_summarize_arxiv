    "since the original 1997 work of frauendorf and meng @xcite , the phenomenon of chiral rotation in atomic nuclei attracts quite a significant attention .",
    "the effect is expected to occur in nuclei having stable triaxial deformation , and in which there are a few high-@xmath6 valence particles and a few high-@xmath6 valence holes . the former drive the nucleus towards prolate , and the latter towards oblate shapes .",
    "the interplay of these opposite tendencies may favor a stable triaxial deformation .",
    "for such a shape , the valence particles and holes align their angular momenta along the short and long axes of the density distribution , respectively . however , the nuclear - bulk moment of inertia with respect to the medium axis is the largest , which favors collective rotation about that axis .",
    "thus , the particle , hole , and collective angular momentum vectors are aplanar , and may form either a left - handed or a right - handed set . in this way , the two enantiomeric forms may give rise to pairs of rotational bands , which are called chiral doublets .",
    "it is expected that the energy splitting between the partners in such doublets is very small , and in fact the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , who have analyzed the experimental results , have used essentially the argument by elimination - the bands were suggested to be chiral partners mainly because their properties could not be explained within other scenarios used by the authors .",
    "the first doublet band , later reinterpreted as chiral @xcite , was found in 1996 by petrache _",
    "_ in @xmath3pr @xcite .",
    "now , about 15 candidate chiral doublet bands are known in the @xmath7 region , and about 10 in the @xmath8 region .",
    "the bands in the @xmath7 nuclei are assigned to the simplest chiral configuration , in which there is one proton particle on the @xmath9 orbital , and one neutron hole on the @xmath10 orbital .",
    "configurations for @xmath8 nuclei usually involve one @xmath11 proton hole and one @xmath10 neutron particle orbitals .",
    "a few cases with more than one active particle or hole were also found @xcite .",
    "so far , experimental information about absolute b(e2 ) and b(m1 ) values for transitions within the observed bands is available only for @xmath12cs and @xmath2la , from recent lifetime measurements by grodner @xcite and srebrny @xcite , and collaborators .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "chiral rotation has been extensively studied by using various versions of the particle - rotor model ( prm ) , in which the nucleus is represented by the valence particles and holes coupled via the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction to a rotator , often described within the davydov - fillipov model @xcite with moments of inertia given by the irrotational - flow formula @xcite , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "however , the main concept of rotational chirality summarized above , came from considerations within the frauendorf s mean - field tilted - axis - cranking ( tac ) model @xcite , which is used in parallel with the prm .",
    "that model is a straightforward generalization of the standard cranking approach to situations where the axis of rotation does not coincide with any principal axis of the mass distribution .    up to now , all the tac calculations for chiral rotation ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for examples ) were performed within a phenomenological approximation , in which the mean field is given by a simple model potential .",
    "a more fundamental description requires self - consistent methods , which would provide a strong test of the stability of the proposed chiral configurations with respect to the core degrees of freedom .",
    "self - consistent methods",
    "are also necessary to take into account all kinds of polarization of the core by the valence particles and full minimization of the underlying energies with respect to all deformation degrees of freedom , including deformations of the current and spin distributions . application of self - consistent methods to the description of chiral rotation is the subject of the present paper .",
    "our study concerns four @xmath0 isotones , @xmath1cs , @xmath2la , @xmath3pr , and @xmath4pm , which are the first nuclei in which candidate chiral bands were systematically studied @xcite .",
    "we used the hartree - fock ( hf ) method with the skyrme effective interaction .",
    "the results were obtained for two skyrme parameter sets , sly4 @xcite and skm * @xcite , and the role of terms in the mean field that are odd under the time reversal was examined .",
    "calculations were carried out by using a new version of the code hfodd ( v2.05c ) @xcite , which was specially constructed by the authors for the purpose of the present study .",
    "from among the considered four isotones , self - consistent chiral solutions were obtained in @xmath2la . a brief report on the results obtained in @xmath2la",
    "was given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ tac_sec ]",
    "we discuss some characteristic aspects of the tac calculations within the self - consistent framework .",
    "section  [ previous_sub ] briefly recalls previous studies on chiral rotation in the concerned isotones , and section  [ detail_sub ] describes all technical details of the present calculations  in particular the way in which the role of time - odd nucleonic densities was examined .",
    "energy minima obtained for non - rotating states are listed in section  [ enemin_sub ] . in section  [ pac_sub ] , rotational properties of the valence nucleons and of the core",
    "are examined within standard principal - axis cranking ( pac ) . in section  [ clasic_sub ]",
    "we solve a simple classical model of chiral rotation and show that such a rotation can not exist below a certain critical angular frequency .",
    "the hf solutions for planar and chiral rotation are presented in sections  [ planar_sub ] and [ chiral_sub ] , respectively . in section  [ separa_sub ]",
    "we demonstrate that our results obtained for the three - dimensional rotation can actually be represented as a sum of three independent one - dimensional rotations about the principal axes .",
    "the values obtained for the critical frequency and the agreement of our results with experimental level energies are discussed in section  [ discus_sec ] . in appendix",
    "[ align_app ] , we study response of the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "angular momenta to three - dimensional rotation , and introduce the notions of _ soft _ and _ stiff _ alignments .",
    "so far , the tac model has been described in the literature only in its phenomenological variant @xcite . therefore ,",
    "in this section we give several details that are specific for its self - consistent implementation .",
    "the discussion concerns mainly the way of iteratively solving the hf equations which is adopted in this work .",
    "as far as non - rotating states are concerned , the hf method consists in minimizing the expectation value of the many - body hamiltonian , @xmath13 , in the trial class of slater determinants . here , @xmath14 is the kinetic - energy operator , and @xmath15 is a two - body effective interaction .",
    "equivalently , one can formulate the method in terms of the energy density functional @xmath16 , which is minimized with respect to the one - body density matrix @xmath17 on which it depends , and this latter representation is used in the present study .",
    "since @xmath18 or the density functional @xmath16 are invariant under rotations in space , it is clear that the hf solution is defined only up to an arbitrary rotation . for each solution",
    "it is useful to introduce an intrinsic frame of reference , whose axes we define as principal axes of the tensor of the electric quadrupole moment of the mass distribution . due to the mentioned arbitrariness",
    ", this frame can be rotated with respect to the frame originally used to solve the hf equations , which we refer to as the program ( or computer - code ) frame .",
    "the program frame is the one defined by the axes @xmath19 , @xmath20 or @xmath21 , used for solving the mean - field equations , e.g. , in a computer code .    to describe rotational excitations within the tac approach , in the program frame one imposes a linear constraint on angular momentum and minimizes the expectation value of the routhian , @xmath22 or the energy density in the rotating frame , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the total angular momentum operator , and vector @xmath25 is composed of three lagrange multipliers ; it is called rotational frequency vector .",
    "its components in the program frame are fixed as part of the definition of @xmath26 or @xmath27 . because of the rotational invariance , solutions obtained for the same length , but different directions of @xmath25 differ only by their orientation in the program frame , so that only the length , @xmath28 , has physical meaning .    within the hf procedure ,",
    "one obtains that the sought slater determinant or the one - body density are built of the eigenstates of the s.p.routhian , @xmath29 where the mean - field hamiltonian , @xmath30 , is a sum of the kinetic energy , @xmath14 , and the mean field , @xmath31 .",
    "a phenomenological approximation to the hf approach consists in replacing @xmath31 with a model potential , like the nilsson potential @xcite , whose deformation dependence is usually parametrized in terms of the multipole deformations of the nuclear surface . then",
    ", the expectation value of the routhian , @xmath32 , is minimized over the deformation parameters of the potential within the standard strutinsky method @xcite .",
    "obviously , only the relative orientation of the angular momentum vector with respect to the nuclear body carries physical information .",
    "common orientation of the angular momentum vector and nucleonic densities with respect to the program frame can thus be arbitrary . in the phenomenological method , where the orientation in space of the nuclear surface is under control via the multipole deformations @xmath33 , one can take advantage of this fact and fix @xmath34 so that the intrinsic and program frames coincide .",
    "minimization of the expectation value of the routhian , @xmath32 , at a given magnitude of @xmath35 is then performed by varying the direction of @xmath25 and all @xmath33 except of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    in the hf method , however , the euler angles defining the orientation of the intrinsic axes in the program frame are not free variational parameters , but complicated functions of densities , which in turn change from one hf iteration to another .",
    "the only possible way to make the two frames coincide is by imposing dynamical constraints on the off - diagonal components of the quadrupole tensor and requiring that they vanish .",
    "then , one can vary the cranking frequency vector like in the phenomenological approach .",
    "this is actually the only way to proceed if the energy dependence on the intrinsic orientation of @xmath25 is sought .",
    "however , constraints strong enough to confine the nucleus easily lead to divergencies , and adjusting their strengths properly may be a cumbersome task .",
    "if only the energy minimum is of interest , a more natural and incomparably faster way is to fix @xmath25 in the program frame and let the mean potential reorient and conform to it self - consistently in the course of the iterations .",
    "the intrinsic axes now do become tilted with respect to the program frame .",
    "the kerman - onishi theorem @xcite states that in each self - consistent solution the total angular momentum vector , @xmath38 , is parallel to @xmath25 . in calculations",
    ", the angle between those vectors converges to zero very slowly in terms of the hf iterations , because the whole nucleus must turn in the program frame in order to align its @xmath39 with the fixed @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , a much faster procedure is to explicitly reset @xmath25 in each iteration to make it parallel to the current @xmath39 , while keeping its length , @xmath35 , constant @xcite .",
    "this purely heuristic procedure does not correspond to a minimization of any given routhian .",
    "however , once the self - consistent solution is found , it is the routhian for the final angular frequency that takes its minimum value .    some quantities , like mean angular momenta and multipole moments , are easiest to discuss only when expressed in the intrinsic frame of the nucleus , but it is a natural way to calculate them first in the program frame .",
    "since the two frames do not necessarily coincide , one has to find the axes of the intrinsic frame by diagonalization of the quadrupole deformation tensor and to transform the considered quantities into that frame by use of the wigner matrices .",
    "( such a procedure may fail when the solutions have vanishing quadrupole moments , but in the present paper such cases are of no interest and will not be discussed ) .",
    "the hf tac solutions are arbitrarily tilted with respect to the program frame , and , moreover , their orientation is not known a priori .",
    "therefore , when solving the problem numerically one should ensure such conditions that the same solution be represented equally well in all orientations . in particular , the energy must not depend on the orientation .",
    "if the s.p .",
    "wave - functions are expanded onto a basis , this means that the choice of the s.p .",
    "basis and of the basis cut - off must not privilege any axis of the reference frame .",
    "in the case of the cartesian harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) basis used in the present study , this by definition amounts to taking the three oscillator frequencies equal and including only the entire ho shells . to obtain a reasonable description of deformed nuclei in such non - deformed bases ,",
    "the only way is to use sufficiently many ho shells .",
    "it the present study , the hf solutions corresponding to chiral rotation were sought in four @xmath0 isotones , @xmath1cs , @xmath2la , @xmath3pr , and @xmath4pm .",
    "these are the first nuclei in which candidate chiral bands were observed and systematically studied @xcite . for the most recent experimental data refer to @xcite for @xmath1cs , to @xcite for @xmath2la , to @xcite for @xmath3pr , and to @xcite for @xmath4pm .",
    "absolute values of spins and reduced transition probabilities were measured only in @xmath2la .",
    "the possible chiral bands known in this nucleus are shown in fig .",
    "[ laener_fig ] with full symbols .",
    "the lowest one ( circles ) is the yrast in positive parity .",
    "two closely - lying excited bands , b1 and b3 ( squares and diamonds ) are known @xcite , and it is unclear which one of them should be viewed as the chiral partner of the yrast band .",
    "the yrast and b1 bands are of positive - parity with known spins , while for band b3 the spin assignments are tentative .",
    "for all the @xmath0 isotones in question , prm calculations were performed @xcite , and generally a good agreement with experiment could be obtained for both the energies and the b(m1)/b(e2 ) ratios , with a proper adjustment of the model parameters . lifetime measurements in @xmath2la @xcite revealed , however , that absolute values of the reduced transition probabilities significantly deviate from these earlier prm predictions .",
    "the phenomenological tac calculations were carried out for all the considered nuclei as well @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole deformations @xmath40 of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and triaxialities @xmath44 of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 were found , respectively for @xmath1cs , @xmath2la , @xmath3pr , @xmath4pm .",
    "chiral solutions were obtained in a limited range of angular frequency .",
    "the lower limits corresponded to the critical frequency , @xmath49 , discussed in the present work . only refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite quote their values , which are @xmath50 for @xmath3pr and @xmath51 for @xmath4pm .",
    "comparison with experimental energies was given only for @xmath3pr in @xcite , where the behavior of the bands was reproduced , on the average .",
    "the present study is limited to the simplest chiral s.p.configuration , @xmath52 , which has been assigned in the literature to the candidate chiral bands observed in the @xmath0 isotones . in order to check",
    "whether the existence of the hf chiral solutions is not a particular feature of one skyrme parameter set , all calculations were repeated with two parametrizations , sly4 @xcite and skm * @xcite .",
    "the parity was kept as a conserved symmetry , and the pairing correlations were not included .    in forming the chiral geometry , orientations of several angular - momentum vectors",
    "play a crucial role .",
    "their behavior depends , among others , on the nucleonic densities which are odd under time reversal , like the current and spin densities .",
    "therefore , taking those densities and corresponding terms in the energy density functional into account seems important for the microscopic description of the chiral rotation .",
    "self - consistent methods are best suited for such a task , and investigating the role of the time - odd densities was one of our priorities in the present study .",
    "the skyrme energy density functional depends on time - even and time - odd nucleonic densities with coupling constants @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ( 10 time - even terms ) and with coupling constants @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ( 10 time - odd terms ) @xcite .",
    "the index @xmath63 denotes the isoscalar and isovector parts . in standard parametrizations , which are used in the present work , @xmath53 and @xmath58 additionally depend on the isoscalar particle density .",
    "if the assumption of the local gauge invariance is made @xcite , there are several following relations between the time - even and time - odd coupling constants , @xmath64    in the present calculations , the coupling constants @xmath56 of the time - even terms for @xmath63 were always set to zero , like in the original fits of the forces sly4 and skm*. in order to conform to the local gauge invariance , whose consequence is eq .",

    "apart from @xmath56 , all other time - even coupling constants were taken as they come from the parameters of the skyrme force .    to examine the role of the time - odd densities ,",
    "we have performed three variants of calculations , throughout the text denoted as @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , and defined in the following way :    * variant @xmath65 : all time - odd coupling constants are set to zero and the local gauge invariance conditions in eq .",

    "* variant @xmath67 : apart from @xmath60 , all other time - odd coupling constants are taken as they come from the parameters of the skyrme force and as required by the local gauge invariance ( [ eveodd_eqn ] ) .",
    "the density - dependent and independent components of @xmath58 were suppressed or not simultaneously . setting or not some time - odd coupling constants to zero implies excluding or including in the calculations the corresponding time - odd terms of the mean field . in variant",
    "@xmath65 , the mean field contained only the time - even contributions ( apart from the cranking term ) as in the case of the phenomenological mean potentials .",
    "the calculations were carried out by using the code hfodd ( v2.05c ) @xcite .",
    "the code expands the s.p.wave-functions onto the ho basis , and uses the iterative method to solve the hf equations .",

    "it is instructive to solve the associated problem of motion in the classical framework , which is done in the next section .      the classical model of chiral rotation",
    "was briefly introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here we give its more detailed description and discussion . in order to define the model , we begin with elementary considerations related to the dynamics of rigid bodies . by a classical gyroscope",
    "we understand an axial - shape rigid body with moments of inertia , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , with respect to the symmetry axis and an axis perpendicular to it , respectively .",
    "such a body spins with fixed angular frequency @xmath123 around its symmetry axis ; one can imagine that this motion is ensured by a motor and frequency regulator such that @xmath123 is strictly constant in time .",
    "furthermore , let us imagine that the spinning body is rigidly mounted on another rigid body that has triaxial inertia tensor and three moments of inertia @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 , with respect to its short , medium , and long axis , respectively .",
    "then , the angular frequency @xmath123 is maintained fixed with respect to the triaxial body , irrespective of how the whole device moves , and the angular frequency vector @xmath127 has by definition three time - independent components @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 . to simplify our considerations let us assume that the axis of the gyroscope coincides with the short axis of the triaxial body , i.e. , @xmath128=@xmath123 , @xmath129=0 , and @xmath130=0 . in this case",
    "the principal axes of the tensor of inertia of the whole device coincide with those of the triaxial body , and the three moments of inertia of the device read , @xmath131    we assume that the device rotates with the total angular frequency vector @xmath25 , which in the moving frame of the triaxial body has components @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 . in general , these components may vary with time , although later we study only such a motion of the device when they are time - independent .",
    "the kinetic energy of the device is the sum of that of the triaxial body and gyroscope , @xmath135 where @xmath136 hence @xmath137 we see that the total kinetic energy is a sum of three terms .",
    "the first one represents the rotation of the entire device irrespective of the fact that it contains a spinning gyroscope ; it depends only on the total moments of inertia .",
    "the second one represents the additional energy coming from the spinning gyroscope and depends on its time - independent spin @xmath138 , while the third one is a constant which can be dropped from further considerations .",
    "it is obvious that if we add two other gyroscopes aligned with the medium and long axes and spinning with spins @xmath139 and @xmath73 , respectively , the second term can be simply written as a scalar product @xmath140 , where vector @xmath141 has components @xmath72 , @xmath139 , and @xmath73 . in this case , the total moment of inertia @xmath111 will be a sum of contributions from the triaxial body and three gyroscopes .",

    "this fact allows us to write the legendre transformation @xcite and to obtain the hamiltonian of the system , @xmath146 since the lagrangian ( [ lekin_eqn ] ) does not depend explicitly on time , the hamilton function ( [ hwil_eqn ] ) is a constant of motion , and is identified with the total energy , @xmath147 , of the system .",
    "consider now a particular type of the routhian @xcite , @xmath148 , namely such that no variables undergo the legendre transformation .",
    "in such a case , @xmath149 , and by rewriting the routhian in terms of the hamiltonian one obtains @xmath150    equations of motion for the model can be derived in the following way . as for any vector ,",
    "the time derivatives of the angular momentum vector , @xmath151  taken in the laboratory frame and @xmath152  taken in a frame rotating with angular frequency @xmath25 , are related by the formula @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "since the angular momentum is conserved in the laboratory frame , @xmath154 , one obtains the euler equations @xcite for the time evolution of the angular - momentum vector in the body - fixed frame , @xmath155    the mean - field cranking approximation can only account for the so - called _ uniform _ rotations , in which the mean angular - momentum vector is constant in the intrinsic frame of the nucleus , @xmath156 .",
    "because of that , we restrict the classical model studied here to such uniform rotations . due to",
    "( [ spin_eqn ] ) , for uniform rotations also the angular frequency vector is constant in the intrinsic frame .",
    "the euler equations ( [ dwti_eqn ] ) now take the form @xmath157 , and require that @xmath25 and @xmath39 be parallel .",
    "the same condition holds for the hf solutions and is known as the kerman - onishi theorem ; see section  [ tac_sec ] and @xcite .",
    "the euler equations can now be easily solved for the considered classical model . however , to show further analogies with the hf method , in what follows we find the uniform solutions by employing a variational principle .    according to the hamilton s principle , motion of a mechanical system",
    "can be found by making the action integral , @xmath158 , stationary .",
    "the real uniform rotations obviously belong to a wider class of trial motions with @xmath39 and @xmath25 being constant in the intrinsic frame , but not necessarily parallel to one another . within this class , lagrangian ( [ lekin_eqn ] ) does not depend on time . therefore , extremizing the action for a given value of @xmath35=@xmath159 reduces to finding extrema of the lagrangian as a function of the intrinsic - frame components of @xmath25 . since @xmath149 ,",
    "the routhian ( [ hhwi_classic_eqn ] ) can be equally well used for this purpose .",
    "this provides us with a bridge between the classical model and the quantum cranking theory , where an analogous routhian ( [ hhwj_cranking_eqn ] ) is minimized in the space of the trial wave - functions .",

    "we continue further derivations for the case of two gyroscopes aligned along the @xmath85 and @xmath87 axes , as dictated by the microscopic results presented in section  [ pac_sub ] , i.e. , we employ the classical model for @xmath139=0 . setting to zero the derivatives of the quantity",

    "the model can then be applied to predict properties of the planar and chiral tac bands , and these predictions can be compared with the hf tac results . such a comparison is presented and discussed in the following sections .",
    "we began our self - consistent tac calculations by finding planar solutions corresponding to the classical band a. the first point of each band of this kind was obtained by restarting the hf iterations from the previously converged non - rotating solution and by applying the initial cranking frequency vector with non - zero components on its short and long intrinsic axes .",

    "[ pacrou_fig ] , now both the lowest and the highest @xmath78 levels split with rotational frequency .",

    "parts of the plots to the left of the thin vertical lines concern the planar bands .",
    "it can be seen that , indeed , the proton particle and the neutron hole align their angular momenta on the short and long axes .",
    "furthermore , those alignments change rather weakly with rotational frequency which means that the wave - functions are strongly confined by deformation ( deformation alignment ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the intrinsic - frame trajectories of @xmath25 along the self - consistent bands almost exactly follow the classical ones , in all the considered cases .",

    "the hf results follow a curve that very much resembles the classical hyperbola . for the _ triaxial _ minima in @xmath3pr and @xmath4pm ,",
    "no self - consistent planar bands could be obtained because of multiple level crossings .",
    "energy in function of spin also shows a striking agreement between the classical and self - consistent results for the planar bands .",

    "[ laener_fig ] , by following the same symbols as those in fig .",
    "[ plaome_fig ] .",
    "some deviations are visible only for rather high angular momenta .",
    "the planar hf solutions were easily obtained by applying small cranking frequency increments to the non - rotating state . for chiral bands ,",
    "analogous task was more difficult , because these bands start at finite frequencies , which in the present case are not lower than @xmath184 .",
    "several level crossings may occur between @xmath185 and such a high frequency , and it is difficult to spot the required s.p .  configuration at high frequencies . a hint on how to follow the @xmath186 configuration diabatically comes from the classical prediction that the chiral band branches off from the planar solution ( at the point corresponding to the critical frequency ) .",
    "one can thus restart iterations from the planar band by applying cranking frequency with non - zero component on the medium axis .    as the first step we performed a kind of perturbative search along the planar bands , which turned out to be a very reliable test of where the chiral solution may exist .",
    "such a search gives us also some understanding of why the chiral solutions do not appear in several cases .",
    "the procedure we applied was the following .",
    "to each converged point of the planar band , a small additional component , @xmath133 , of the angular frequency along the medium axis was added , with @xmath132 and @xmath134 unchanged . the resulting s.p .",
    "routhian ( [ hhwj_eqn ] ) was diagonalized only once .",
    "then , it was checked whether in the resulting non - selfconsistent state the angular momentum and rotational frequency vectors were parallel , as required by the kerman - onishi necessary condition of self - consistency ; see section  [ tac_sec ] .",
    "we can guess that in nuclei stiff against deformation changes , the direction of @xmath39 is the only degree of freedom , and thus the kerman - onishi condition is also sufficient . if @xmath39 is parallel to @xmath25 in the non - selfconsistent state after one diagonalization , then it is very probable that further iterations may lead to a converged chiral solution .",
    "indeed , this was always the case , and never a chiral solution was obtained , in spite of several attempts , if that simple test gave negative result .",
    "the condition for @xmath39 and @xmath25 being parallel can be written in the form @xmath187 note that the @xmath188 and @xmath189 ratios must be very close to each other in the non - selfconsistent state , because the kerman - onishi condition is fulfilled for the self - consistent planar state .",
    "therefore , the test consists in checking for each point of the planar band if @xmath190 is equal to @xmath191 .",
    "in fact , this is reliable only if the time - odd fields are switched off , because in their presence , the @xmath190 ratio calculated perturbatively is significantly smaller than the self - consistent result would be .",
    "the reason is that the relevant components of the time - odd fields become active only after self - consistency is achieved for a non - zero @xmath133 .",
    "the test was made with @xmath192 .",
    "the discussed ratios , calculated for all the hf planar bands found in the @xmath0 isotones , are plotted in fig .",

    "it can be a priori expected that chiral solutions do not appear in the _ oblate _ minima in @xmath3pr and @xmath4pm , because of insufficient triaxiality .",
    "indeed , the calculated values of the @xmath190 and @xmath193 ratios exhibit a complicated behavior , and do not become equal to one another at any point . in @xmath1cs , as well as in the _",
    "triaxial _ minimum in @xmath4pm , the two ratios clearly approach each other .",
    "it seems that the only reason why they do not attain equality is that the planar bands were not found up to sufficiently high frequencies , because of level crossings .",
    "note , however , that the moment of inertia associated with the medium axis , @xmath190 , significantly drops with angular frequency , which takes @xmath190 away from @xmath193 , and defers their equalization to higher frequencies .",
    "this effect is much weaker in @xmath2la , where the ratios do become equal , slightly above the point expected from the classical model .",

    "the found fragments of chiral bands were used as starting points to obtain solutions for lower and higher frequencies .",
    "calculations were performed with @xmath35 step of @xmath195 . at a certain value of decreasing @xmath35 , the planar orientation of @xmath39",
    "was regained in the intrinsic frame , and the solution merged into the previously found planar one . in a natural way , that junction value of @xmath35 can be regarded as the skyrme - hf result for the critical frequency , and is denoted in the following as @xmath196 .",
    "values of @xmath196 obtained in the present calculations are collected in table  [ crifre_tab ] , and discussed in section  [ discus_sec ] .",
    "on the side of highest frequencies , chiral solutions were obtained up to a certain value of @xmath35 , and all attempts to go higher caused the iterations to fall into a different minimum .",
    "this is probably due to multiple smooth crossings of occupied and empty levels , particularly in neutrons .",
    "the hf results presented so far corroborate the main prediction of the classical model , that chiral solution exists only above a certain critical frequency , at which it branches off from the planar one .",
    "also the intrinsic - frame trajectory of @xmath25 along the hf chiral band is almost a straight line parallel to the medium axis , as in the classical case .",

    "we take the same value as for the planar case , because the chiral band can be regarded as a continuation of the planar one , as discussed in section  [ chiral_sub ] .",
    "the equivalent routhian can be plotted only in such a frequency range in which the pac solutions are obtained for the corresponding components @xmath93 . in that range",
    ", @xmath210 deviates from @xmath211 by not more than 30kev , as it can be seen from the figure , whereas the total routhian itself drops by about 8mev between @xmath185 and 0.6mev/@xmath182 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the equivalent routhian , constructed out of the pac solutions , reproduces the full tac routhian to a very high accuracy .",
    "another piece of information that is contained in the tac results , and not directly in the pac results , is how the total angular frequency , @xmath35 , should be distributed over the three principal axes for each given point of a band representing the rotation about a tilted axis . that , however , can also be determined from the pac solutions by means of the kerman - onishi requirement @xcite ( see section  [ tac_sec ] ) that the angular - momentum vector must be parallel to the angular - frequency vector",
    "indeed , this condition is equivalent to the system of three non - linear equations , @xmath212 by plotting the three pac functions @xmath213 on the same plot as functions of @xmath93 we obtain a planar or chiral solution whenever two or three , respectively , of these functions cross a horizontal line .",
    "then , values of @xmath93 corresponding to the crossing points define the requested distribution of the components within the total angular frequency @xmath35 .",
    "the agreement of the pac and tac alignments shown in fig .",
    "[ separa_fig ] guarantees that the above procedure gives a correct result .",
    "we have thus demonstrated that within our hf results , the general 2d or 3d rotation separates into two or three , in a sense independent , 1d rotations about the principal axes .",
    "this is possible mainly because our solutions are very stiff against deformation changes with rotational frequency .",
    "had they been soft , rotations about different ( principal or tilted ) axes could cause different shape polarizations that would prevent such a simple superposition of motions . yet , whenever the motions are separable , the pac calculations supplemented with the kerman - onishi condition are actually sufficient to describe the 2d or 3d rotations .",
    "although this rule has to be , in principle , confirmed numerically in each particular case , it is plausible that it will hold in all analogous cases of stiff alignments , by which the difficult tac calculations can be replaced by much more easily performed pac calculations .",
    "the main point left for the discussion concerns the values of the critical frequency : where do they come from , whether they depend on the skyrme force used , how they are altered by the different time - odd terms of the functional , how they would be influenced by the inclusion of pairing , and what their relation to the experimentally observed bands is . in this section",
    "we give some remarks on these and related topics .",

    "( [ crifre_eqn ] ) , and of the critical frequency , @xmath196 , obtained from the hf tac calculations as defined in section  [ chiral_sub ] . in addition , the table gives the corresponding values of critical spins , @xmath179 and @xmath214 , respectively .",
    "first of all , it can be seen from the examples of @xmath1cs and @xmath2la that the sly4 and skm * forces give quite similar values for all the concerned quantities .",
    "the differences are not larger than variations within one force due to taking into account different time - odd fields .",
    "for all the four isotones in question , switching on the fields @xmath66 increases all the moments of inertia , but particularly @xmath70 , with respect to the case @xmath65 .",
    "this causes a decrease in @xmath197 , but the corresponding @xmath179 does not change much , because @xmath70 is larger .",
    "switching on the fields @xmath67 results in values of @xmath70 between those obtained for the cases @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the critical frequency always becomes higher than for the @xmath66 fields , and the resulting critical spin is always the highest among all the examined sets of time - odd fields .",
    "these variations in @xmath179 are of the order of a few spin units .    in @xmath2la , where the hf chiral solutions were found in section  [ chiral_sub ] , values of the hf critical frequency and spin , @xmath196 and @xmath214 , are slightly higher than the classical estimates , @xmath197 and @xmath179 .",
    "this can be understood on the basis of results of the perturbative search for the hf chiral solutions , performed in section  [ chiral_sub ] . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ search_fig ] , the perturbative ratio @xmath190 , representing the moment of inertia with respect to the medium axis , @xmath70 , slightly falls with rotational frequency , which , according to eq .",
    "( [ crifre_eqn ] ) , causes the rise of the critical frequency .",
    "when the time - odd fields are included , values of @xmath196 and @xmath214 vary similarly to those of @xmath197 and @xmath179 .",
    "the hf method used in the present study does not take into account the pair correlations . in order to include pairing in self - consistent calculations",
    "one would have to apply the hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb ) method in the tac regime with two quasiparticle states blocked .",
    "present codes do not allow for such a study , and a systematic investigation of pairing has to be left for future analyses .",
    "on the one hand , one can expect that pairing effects may facilitate the calculations by removing the sharp level crossings that occur in the hf method , but on the other hand , convergence in presence of blocked states may be more difficult to obtain .",
    "supposing that the hfb tac results can be inferred from the hfb pac calculations through a determination of the parameters of the classical model , one could gain some information on pairing effects by analyzing the hfb pac moments of inertia and alignments .",
    "the critical frequency represents the transition point between planar and chiral rotation .",
    "the notion of critical frequency was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the expression ( [ crifre_eqn ] ) for its value was derived from the simple classical model presented in section  [ clasic_sub ] .",
    "however , the occurrence of a transition from planar to chiral regime in the structure of chiral bands was clear already from earlier investigations . both within the prm and tac , this effect was obtained numerically but left without comment .",
    "this transition is abrupt in the semi - classical cranking model , but may be rather smooth in real nuclei .",
    "this is because the angular momentum vector oscillates about the planar equilibrium below @xmath215 , which corresponds to non - uniform classical rotations @xcite , while above @xmath215 , it can still tunnel between the left and right chiral minima , which represents chiral vibrations @xcite .    because of these reasons , mean - field methods can provide quantitative description of the bands in question only in the low - spin , planar regime , where there is only one minimum . in the chiral region ,",
    "the mean - field approach does not take into account the interaction between the left and right minima , which are exactly degenerate in energy , and the experimentally observed energy splitting between the chiral partners can not be calculated .",
    "it is argued in the literature that the mean - field chiral solution can be viewed as a kind of average of the two partner bands , and thus mean trends can be compared .",
    "one can also speculate about the value of the critical frequency or spin .",
    "description of the transition region is an interesting topic for study invoking techniques beyond the mean field , like the generating - coordinate method .",
    "figure  [ laener_fig ] gives a comparison of experimental and calculated energies in @xmath2la .",
    "full symbols denote the experimental yrast ( circles ) , b1 ( squares ) , and b3 ( diamonds ) bands , discussed in section  [ detail_sub ] .",
    "open circles and black crosses represent the hf tac planar and chiral solutions , respectively .",
    "their classical counterparts are marked with dashed and solid lines .",
    "the hf results for the critical spin , @xmath216 , are rather high as compared to the spin range , in which the bands b1 and b3 are observed .",
    "yet , the classical estimate , @xmath217 , evaluated for the total - routhian - surface ( trs ) pac results is already below that range @xcite .",
    "this means that the inclusion of pairing in the calculations may be important for correct interpretation of the data .",
    "however , from the closeness of experimental spins to the possible values of @xmath218 one can suppose that , whichever of the bands b1 and b3 could eventually be interpreted as the chiral partner of the yrast band , the concerned spin region may actually represent the transition between planar and chiral rotation .",
    "although no hf chiral solutions were found in @xmath1cs , similar conclusions can be drawn for that isotone on the basis of the classical estimates of the critical spin . in case of @xmath3pr and @xmath4pm",
    "it is not clear whether the _ oblate _ or _ triaxial _",
    "solutions should be taken for comparison with the bands observed in those nuclei .    at low spins in @xmath2la , where the supposed chiral partners have not been observed ,",
    "the yrast band is well reproduced by the hf planar solutions , particularly with the time - odd fields included .",
    "this is consistent with the supposed planar character of rotation at low spins",
    ". roughly at the spin where the chiral partners commence to be visible , the yrast band significantly changes its behavior , which can be attributed to entering into the chiral regime . in this spin region",
    "the hf results agree semi - quantitatively with experimental energies .",
    "to conclude , the first skyrme - hartree - fock ( skyrme - hf ) calculations with the tilted - axis cranking were performed in @xmath1cs , @xmath2la , @xmath3pr , and @xmath4pm in the search for self - consistent solutions corresponding to nuclear chiral rotation .",
    "only the configuration @xmath52 , earlier assigned to the observed candidate chiral bands in those isotones , was considered .",

    "terms depending on time - odd nucleonic densities were either kept or excluded from the skyrme energy functional .    from the principal - axis - cranking analysis",
    "it was concluded that the system in question can be modeled by two gyroscopes , representing the valence particle and hole , with spins stiffly aligned with the short and long axes of a triaxial rigid rotor , which stands for the core .",
    "such a model was analyzed in the classical framework .",
    "this led to an important conclusion that chiral rotation can exist only above a critical angular frequency , given by a simple expression .",
    "the hf solutions representing planar rotation were found in all the considered @xmath0 isotones , and chiral solutions were obtained in @xmath2la .",
    "these solutions provide the first proof based on fully self - consistent methods that nuclear rotation can attain a chiral character . in all cases ,",
    "the self - consistent solutions agree surprisingly well with the results of the classical model , which means that the model faithfully represents salient features of the examined phenomenon .",
    "it was found that the time - odd densities in the energy functional have no qualitative influence on the results , and change mainly the moments of inertia .",
    "the hf values of the critical frequency are rather high as compared to the spin range in which the candidate chiral bands were observed in @xmath2la .",
    "the hf energies agree satisfactorily with experiment only in the low - spin parts of the bands , where the rotation is supposed to be planar . in the chiral regime ,",
    "the mean field is unable to reproduce the data precisely , and the agreement is only qualitative .",
    "it seems , also , that the experimentally observed bands actually represent a transition from planar to chiral rotation .",
    "the criteria used so far when attributing the chirality - partnership interpretation to the experimentally found rotational bands that are based on the small energy splitting argument are clearly unsatisfactory on a long run .",
    "numerous superdeformed band studies ( followed by the normal - deformation studies ) have shown that different intrinsic configurations and thus strictly speaking different - shape nuclei may manifest nearly identical rotational bands .",
    "it is therefore necessary , to provide the experimental evidence going beyond just the energy measurements , first of all the accompanying electromagnetic - transition information .",
    "this could help excluding the mistake of interpreting e.g.  the shape coexistence phenomena in terms of chirality  without providing extra sufficient conditions . in this paper",
    "we were not able to propose any clear - cut necessary - and - sufficient condition criteria to attribute the chirality label to the experimental bands either . however , we do believe that the concept of the critical frequency discussed in detail in this paper provides a useful tool in interpreting the experimental results .",
