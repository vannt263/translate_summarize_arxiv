    "if allowed to evolve long enough , the reynolds number of a rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) flow @xcite increases and the mixing eventually becomes fully turbulent @xcite .",
    "then , at late time , the width of the mixing layer grows according to @xmath0 when the gravitational field history @xcite is of the form @xmath1 .",
    "the atwood number @xmath2 quantifies the density contrast of the initially pure fluids and is tied to the acceleration in any buoyant flow . from a purely theoretical point of view , the rt growth rate coefficient @xmath3 should be universal if the late stage of the evolution of the mixing zone is self similar and should only depend upon the exponent @xmath4 of the gravitational field history",
    ". however , even today , the value of `` alpha '' ( @xmath5 ) , which is the name given by the `` alpha - group collaboration '' @xcite to @xmath6 when @xmath7 ( constant acceleration ) , is still a subject of controversy .    for years",
    ", the discrepancy between its value inferred from numerical simulations @xcite ( initialised with small wave lengths ) , scattered around @xmath8 , and its experimental values @xcite , twice as large , has thrown doubt on its universality . not long ago , the heuristic mode - competition mechanism @xcite put an end to this paradox : adding a small amount of modes of large wave length to the perturbation of the initial interface helps increase the value of @xmath5 and reconciles numerical simulations with laboratory experiments .",
    "but , it is also instrumental in demonstrating that the initial conditions in any laboratory experiments do feature these modes of large wave length triggered by external causes like vibrations and residual motions .",
    "flows of interest ( geophysics , atmospheric , astrophysics @xcite ) , to a large extent , are not confined to a laboratory .",
    "orders of magnitude may separate the length scales of the interface perturbation with the geometric size of the flow .",
    "this is why , the mode - coupling mechanism , initiated with small wave length modes , is thought to be realised in astrophysical mixing @xcite and other natural flows .    here , in order to find the theoretical value of the growth rate ( @xmath3 ) , we have adopted a point of view which has been used in the study of homogeneous turbulence ( ht ) for almost half a century but never investigated in rt turbulent mixing .",
    "the `` large - scale structure of homogeneous turbulence '' @xcite has been studied to understand the conjectured persistence of big eddies and the decay rate of various physical quantities in turbulent flows . at large scales ,",
    "the turbulent kinetic energy density spectrum behaves as @xmath9 where the value of @xmath10 depends on the initialisation of freely decaying ht in a way which is still unclear @xcite .",
    "bulk quantities of such flows , like turbulent kinetic energy , vary as power - laws at late time and their exponents appear solely related to the value of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "that underlines the fact that large scale spectra have a strong influence on the behaviour of the overall flow .",
    "the theoretical study of freely decaying ht is made difficult by the fact that large scales are driven by non linear effect ( triadic interaction ) .",
    "in contrast , the rt turbulence , although anisotropic , displays a significant difference with freely decaying ht . when plunged in a gravitational field , density fluctuations produce motion through buoyancy .",
    "this production mechanism affects all scales @xcite , even the largest , and produces turbulent kinetic energy at all times .",
    "it overcomes non linear transfer mechanism at large scales making the theoretical study of rt turbulence much easier .    here",
    "we demonstrate that it is possible to display an exact formula for @xmath3 which depends upon @xmath4 , the exponent of the acceleration history , and @xmath10 , the power - law exponent at large scales of _ foliated _ spectra that rise up naturally , along with _ foliated _ average , from the theoretical developments hereafter",
    "procedure is introduced for the first time in turbulent mixing theory because , among other interesting features , it allows to cancel out the formal effect of pressure in the equations , while keeping its physical effect on the whole mixing zone , making theoretical calculations amenable .",
    "a rt mixing occurs whenever two fluids of different density , initially separated by a sharp interface , are subjected to a gravitational field directed from the heavier ( density @xmath11 ) to the lighter ( density @xmath12 ) and when the initial interface is slightly distorted by a perturbation whose spectrum contains modes with sufficiently large wave lengths to overcome viscous effects at the onset .",
    "such a flow , with two incompressible fluids in the low atwood limit @xmath13 ( boussinesq approximation ) , is governed @xcite by a concentration equation ( [ eqc ] ) , the navier stokes equation supplemented with a buoyant source term ( [ equ ] ) , and the incompressibility constraint ( [ eqdiv ] ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mass fraction of the heavy fluid ( @xmath16 in pure light fluid and @xmath17 in pure heavy fluid ) , @xmath18 the velocity field and @xmath19 the pressure field . the molecular diffusivity @xmath20 and the kinematic viscosity of the mixture @xmath21",
    "are both assumed to be constant .",
    "the gravitational acceleration vector @xmath22 points down and its intensity may be time dependent as outlined earlier . in our simulations",
    "( described in the section  [ sec::sim ] ) , the flow fills a rectangular box of size @xmath23 ( see fig.[fig : fig1 ] for more details ) .",
    "the calculation starts by averaging ( [ eqc]-[eqdiv ] ) .",
    "the transverse spatial average of a physical quantity @xmath24 at height @xmath25 is defined according to @xmath26 along with its fluctuating part @xmath27 .",
    "velocity , concentration and pressure fields can be decomposed into a mean and fluctuating part : @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the velocity along the @xmath25 axis will be called @xmath31 and @xmath32 will denote the transverse component in the xy plane so that @xmath33 . the relation @xmath34 is inferred from the divergence equation ( [ eqdiv ] ) and the fact that vertical velocity must be zero on the top and bottom walls . homogeneity and isotropy in the transverse plane ( no privileged direction ) give @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 at all times @xcite ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the behaviour of the fluctuating flow will be studied at large scales ( low @xmath39 ) and at high reynolds number",
    ". viscous and diffusive terms ( in factor of @xmath21 and @xmath20 ) can then be discarded .",
    "therefore , the resulting set of equations governing the evolution of the fluctuating flow at large scales reads @xmath40 where einstein summation convention is used on the repeated indices @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the last equations can be fourier transformed for the purpose of showing that the growth rate of a rt mixing zone depends upon the structure of turbulence at large scales . since the physical domain is assumed to be periodic along @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( see fig.[fig : fig1 ] )",
    ", one defines a fourier transform operator acting on these two directions only ( transverse directions ) .",
    "it turns a generic quantity @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the transverse position , into @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the transverse wave vector .",
    "equations ( [ eqfc]-[eqfux ] ) become @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the usual folded product . in order to simplify ( [ eqffc]-[eqffv ] )",
    "one can eliminate the effect of @xmath51 , and with it , the effect of pressure and non locality , by integrating these equations along the anisotropic direction @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , these arguments suggest introducing the _ foliated _ spatial average which , for a physical quantity @xmath24 , is defined according to @xmath52 it amounts to chopping the domain ( foliation ) in elementary slices , transverse to the anisotropic direction , and to squeezing them by adding them up , resulting in an effective 2d flow ( see fig.[fig : fig2 ] ) . both in the concentration equation ( [ eqffc ] ) and in the equation of motion ( [ eqffuz ] ) , @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 or @xmath55 ) because at top and bottom walls @xmath56 .",
    "the average of the pressure gradient is @xmath57 because pressure fluctuations decrease outside the mixing zone .",
    "it has to be assumed that the top and bottom walls are far enough so that @xmath58 .",
    "consequently , the boundaries do not affect the flow within the mixing zone if @xmath59 ( which can be relaxed to @xmath60 in simulations ) .",
    "this is why , the resulting concentration equation and equation of motion after _ foliated _ average are @xmath61 in eq.([eocl ] ) , the term @xmath62 can be simplified because the profile of @xmath63 is a straight line ( constant slope ) , from 0 to 1 , from one edge of the mixing zone to the other , at small atwood number .",
    "this is corroborated experimentally @xcite and numerically , in our simulations ( @xmath64 ) , to within statistical fluctuations due , at a given height @xmath25 , to the finite number @xmath65 of eddies in the transverse plane of area @xmath66 .",
    "the integral length scale @xmath67 , i.e. the diameter of a typical eddy , varies like @xmath68 in the self - similar regime .",
    "these statistical fluctuations become negligible in the limit @xmath69 since their rms amplitude is of the order @xmath70 . in this limit ,",
    "the derivative @xmath71 is then uniform within the mixing zone .",
    "thus , the theoretical development suggests defining @xmath72 such that @xmath73 which can be brought close to another definition of the width at low atwood number ( see the end of  [ sec::sim ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible to write @xmath74 . as a consequence , ( i ) at large scale ( @xmath75 ) , ( ii ) at low atwood ( iii ) at high reynolds number and ( iv ) in the limit @xmath69 ( i.e. @xmath76 ) , the evolution of _ foliated _",

    "let us note @xmath81 the ensemble average of a generic quantity @xmath24 .",
    "because of isotropy in the transverse direction in the self - similar fully turbulent regime , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "it suggests defining the ensemble averaged _ foliated _ spectra for kinetic energy , concentration and production respectively as @xmath85}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integration over the solid angle @xmath86 is to be understood as the integration over all directions of @xmath87 ( in the transverse plane ) .",
    "it is then found that these spectra , referred to as _ foliated _",
    "spectra for short , are coupled to each other at large scales according to @xmath88 it should be stressed that this closed set of equations does not hold if _ foliated _ average operators are removed or even replaced by transverse average because of the non local effect of pressure . since these equations are linear , autonomous in @xmath39 and do not display derivatives with respect to @xmath39 , it comes as a byproduct prediction of the theory that , with the aforementioned definitions , all three _ foliated _ spectra must have the same power - law exponent at large scales : @xmath89 .",
    "the exponent @xmath10 is independent of time to comply with self - similarity .",
    "this common value is a special feature of the _ foliated _ spectra ( see fig.[fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "_ foliated _ spectra have deliberately been designated by script @xmath90 in order to stress the difference with transverse spectra classically defined by @xmath91~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] both types of spectrum were compared to show that this common exponent is specific to the _ foliated _ spectra whereas transverse spectra ( concentration and velocity for instance ) have different power - law exponents @xcite at large scales .",
    "this can be understood when realising that a transverse spectrum is calculated using fourier modes on a slice at a height @xmath25 in the middle of the mixing zone .",
    "foliated _ spectrum , on the other hand , uses the sum along @xmath25 of all these modes .",
    "the resulting spectrum is radically different and benefits from interferences between modes at different heights .",
    "for self - similarity to hold , the late time behaviour of the _ foliated _ spectra must be @xmath92 at low @xmath39 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are constants independent from @xmath39 and @xmath96 .",
    "in addition , the exponent of @xmath39 in each of this averaged spectrum ( @xmath10 ) and the time exponents ( @xmath97 ) must be constant in time . when replacing these expressions with @xmath98 and @xmath99 in eqs .",
    "( [ fin1]-[fin3 ] ) one gets the following relations @xmath100 which are not modelled but come straight from first principles . using eqs.([fol1]-[fol2 ] ) and eqs.([resfol1]-[resfol2 ] ) , a non trivial exact result can be deduced : @xmath101 valid at large scale ( see fig.[fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "a fundamental feature of concentration is that its fluctuation variance , @xmath102 tends to a constant in the self - similar regime because concentration is a physical quantity bounded between 0 and 1 .",
    "it can not go to zero for that would mean the mixing tends to be heterogeneous in the middle of the mixing zone , thereby going against the fact that at all times any side of the mixing zone must be supplied with pure fluid from the other side .",
    "the mixed - fluid - supplying - channels have been highlighted in fig.[fig : fig1 ] and fig.[fig : fig2 ] .",
    "this is exemplified by numerical simulations and experiments reporting molecular mixing rates ranging from @xmath103 to @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "the question now is : how about @xmath105 ?",
    "a very simple argument can be given : the discretized foliated average @xmath106 can be approximated by @xmath107 since @xmath108 is only non zero within the mixing zone .",
    "that is why , @xmath109 and @xmath110 if we say @xmath111 in the self similar regime as described in the previous paragraph .",
    "therefore , @xmath112 . as",
    "a result @xmath105 must grow like @xmath113 ( corroborated by our numerical simulations ) .",
    "therefore , since @xmath114 varies as @xmath115 and must evolve as @xmath116 , the value of @xmath117 is bound to be @xmath118 and , by inference , the time exponents @xmath119 and @xmath120 . therefore , the value of the rayleigh - taylor growth rate for the turbulent mixing zone width , @xmath3 , is shown to depend upon @xmath4 , which is the acceleration exponent , and @xmath10 , the _ foliated _ spectrum power - law exponent at large scales , according to @xmath121 this expression does not depend on @xmath122 as expected and confirmed in our simulations .",
    "the demonstration leading to this formula did not provide any arguments against the idea of an @xmath10 varying with @xmath4 .",
    "however , growth rates , at various values of @xmath4 given by our simulations in conjunction with those provided in @xcite , were fitted to the theoretical formula and a remarkable collapse of the data was found for @xmath123 assuming @xmath10 was independent of @xmath4 ( see fig.[fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "it is possible to check this result by using an other obvious method : direct inspection of the _ foliated spectra_. the power - law at large scales of _ foliated _ spectra was checked on every simulation ( @xmath7 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) and was found to be compatible with @xmath127 .",
    "the formula ( [ alphan ] ) is therefore a predictive formula : it gives the value of @xmath3 knowing @xmath4 ( a controled parameter ) and @xmath10 or , the other way around , it gives @xmath10 knowing @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "our theory did not provide a value for @xmath10 for it certainly depends upon the way the mixing flow reaches the self - similar regime . in order to find its value ,",
    "the theory would have to cope with the transition regime to make the connexion with the linear growth of the initial conditions ( @xmath127 seems to be compatible with annular spectrum initial conditions ) .",
    "it must be emphasized that the exact result ( [ alphan ] ) is a proof that , in the self - similar regime , the growth of the mixing zone only depends upon the structure of turbulence at large scales ( appart from @xmath4 , it depends on @xmath10 only ) .",
    "obviously , the formula for @xmath3 carries information on the dynamics of the mixing zone width .",
    "not so obvious is the fact that it also provides information on the way this dynamic affects the mixing at large scale . if it is assumed that the late time evolution of the mixing zone width does not depend upon initial conditions - which may be true when the characteristic length scale of the initial perturbations is much smaller than that of the physical domain @xmath128 - it is reasonable to admit that it must depend on @xmath113 ( and its derivatives ) and @xmath129 which are the only control parameters left in the problem",
    ". from this assumption , basis of the buoyancy - drag approach @xcite , it is possible to build a simple evolution equation , @xmath130 which depends on two adjustable constants .",
    "the constant @xmath131 quantifies buoyancy related to the mixing since @xmath132 can be seen as an effective atwood number : the fluids are not pure , with density @xmath12 and @xmath11 , in the mixing zone but they are partly mixed with intermediate densities and the smaller @xmath131 , the smaller the effective atwood number , the stronger the mixing .",
    "the constant @xmath133 quantifies drag , i.e. the exchange of momentum between raising and falling mixed - fluids structures .",
    "this phenomenological approach does not by itself provide any relation between these two adjustable constants .",
    "however , replacing the self - similar values ( [ width ] ) of @xmath72 and @xmath134 in ( [ bdf ] ) allows to recover the exact formula ( [ alphan ] ) if and only if @xmath135 and @xmath136 , which yields @xmath137 .",
    "this correspondence between the simple model and the exact result demonstrate the little importance of small scale as opposed to large scale in the bulk dynamics of the mixing .",
    "furthermore , it enables to understand the influence of @xmath10 on `` intuitive '' physical mechanisms like buoyancy , through the effective atwood number , and drag .",
    "accordingly , the bigger @xmath10 , the stronger the drag , the smaller the effective atwood number and the better the mixing .",
    "this is in agreement with numerical results @xcite suggesting that a smaller proportion of long wave length in the spectrum ( bigger @xmath10 : mode - coupling ) decreases the growth rate of the mixing zone width in opposition to a bigger proportion of long wave length ( smaller @xmath10 : mode - competition ) .",
    "therefore , in the framework of _ foliated _ spectra where @xmath10 is defined , the two phenomenological mechanisms of mode - coupling and mode - competition in rayleigh - taylor turbulent mixing can be explained and brought together .",
    "there is no reason in principle why techniques developed in this work could not be applied to other mixing flows with one anisotropic direction .",
    "for instance , in the case of richtmyer - meshkov ( rm ) turbulence @xcite , @xmath138 and the mixing width @xmath113 varies like @xmath139 in eqs.([fin1]-[fin3 ] ) .",
    "persistence of big eddies @xcite is then an exact result for the _ foliated _ rm flow since the rhs of eq.([fin2 ] ) vanishes .",
    "the same type of reasoning that led to eq.([alphan ] ) allows to find @xmath140 ( also an exact result when @xmath10 is the power - law exponent of ensemble averaged _ foliated _ spectra at large scale ) which for @xmath141 predicts a @xmath142 , in agreement with experimental and numerical results .",
    "a set of four simulations of rayleigh - taylor turbulent mixing flows were carried out with the incompressible code surfer @xcite for different acceleration histories @xmath1 with @xmath7 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 . for our purpose , gravity was added to the original version .",
    "an incompressible code is valuable to investigate flows under variable acceleration because hydrostatic pressure balances instantaneously with the acceleration field . on the contrary",
    ", a compressible simulation would have to cope with the creation of acoustic waves that would travel at the speed of sound to balance pressure with time - varying acceleration .",
    "these acoustic waves would bounce on the domain walls , would go back and forth through the simulation domain and would be detrimental to the simulations .",
    "each of those simulations was performed with the same grid resolution : @xmath146 ( along @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath25 respectively ) .",
    "the large scale outcomes of a numerical simulation of a rayleigh - taylor turbulent flow do not vary significantly , for a given type of initial condition , by increasing the resolution .",
    "this explains the choice of such a modest resolution allowing to carry out more simulations .",
    "surfer is parallelised , 3d and evolves two immiscible fluids separated by an interface . to reconstruct and advance the fluid interfaces in time",
    ", surfer uses an exactly volume conserving variant of the volume of fluid algorithm with a piecewise linear interface calculation method ( vof / plic ) @xcite .",
    "the density of each fluid @xmath11 ( for heavy ) and @xmath12 ( for light fluid ) are constant in time .",
    "the navier - stokes equation governing the evolution of the velocity field @xmath147 is given by : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the density , @xmath4 is the pressure and @xmath150 is the acceleration . the dynamic viscosity @xmath151 equals @xmath152 or @xmath153 ( where @xmath21 is a common kinematic viscosity ) and @xmath154 is the rate of strain tensor defined by @xmath155 .",
    "the surface tension @xmath156 depends on the particular two fluids that will be heterogeneously mixed and the delta function , @xmath157 , is concentrated on the surface of the interface , @xmath158 is the mean curvature of this surface and @xmath159 is the unit normal on the surface .",
    "the discretisation of ( [ ns ] ) is performed on a mac - type staggered grid and the pressure is computed using an iterative multigrid poisson solver .",
    "the simulations were carried out in nondimensional units .",
    "initially , two vertically stacked fluid layers of different density , such that @xmath64 , have been considered ( see fig.[fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were prescribed on the four vertical domain walls , whereas no flux and no slip conditions were imposed on the two horizontal walls of the domain , at the top and at the bottom .",
    "initially , the velocity field @xmath160 is perturbed around the interface using a sum of random small amplitude modes which comply with the incompressibility condition .",
    "the wave numbers selected verify @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) to get a late time self - similar evolution of the flow ( mode - coupling mechanism ) .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is affected by how the width of the mixing zone , @xmath113 , is measured or computed . experimentally and numerically , two methods are employed and they both use @xmath63 .",
    "the threshold method prescribes @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "this method is affected by statistical fluctuations of @xmath166 producing noisy @xmath167 and an even noisier derivative .",
    "the integral method prescribes @xmath168 which provides an exact value if the profile of @xmath166 is affine .",
    "since @xmath166 is almost affine everywhere in our simulation at low atwood , the difference between @xmath169 and @xmath170 is negligibly small . in a sense ,",
    "the reasoning that led to the growth rate formula dictated the definition of @xmath72 , by the integral method , which has been used to calculate the value of @xmath3 in each of the four simulations .",
