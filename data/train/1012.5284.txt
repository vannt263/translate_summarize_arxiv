    "the large - scale dynamics of astrophysical plasmas is theoretically described within the framework of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) . in many cases of interest",
    ", these astrophysical flows are characterized by extremely large reynolds numbers , which in turn implies that a wide range of spatial scales are relevant to properly describe their dynamical behavior . at sufficiently small spatial scales ,",
    "kinetic plasma processes might become non - negligible under certain circumstances .",
    "for instance , in a fully ionized plasma , whenever one reaches spatial scales as small as the ion skin depth @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the speed of light and @xmath2 is the ion plasma frequency ) , the hall effect should not be neglected .",
    "this regime correspond to fully ionized plasmas with sufficiently low ion densities .",
    "however , it can also arise in cold plasmas with a low ionization fraction @xmath3 in wich case the relevant hall scale is given by @xmath4 ( see @xcite for details on hall - mhd of partially ionized plasmas ) .",
    "in cold plasmas such as those present in protoplanetary disks , another kinetic effect known as ambipolar diffusion might become relevant @xcite , especially toward the disk surface @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of non - ideal effects such as hall , ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion has been extensively discussed by @xcite as well as by @xcite . to highlight the relevance of the hall effect in astrophysical plasmas , it is useful to compare the orders of magnitude of the ohmic ( @xmath5 ) , inductive ( @xmath6 ) , and hall ( @xmath7 ) terms in the generalized ohms s law .",
    "for example , in a typical protostellar disk , the relevant ratios are @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite ; while , for dwarf nova disk @xmath10 @xcite and for the crust of a neutron star @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "there are many examples of astrophysical plasma flows for which the role of the hall effect has been studied : regions of star formation @xcite , dense molecular clouds @xcite , the interstellar medium @xcite or even the early universe @xcite . due to their intense magnetic fields ,",
    "the hall currents can be relevant also in white dwarfs and neutron stars @xcite .",
    "also , the role of hall currents in the generation of magnetic fields by turbulent dynamo activity has been studied by @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein .    even though the dynamics of small - scale structures is often unobservable in astrophysical flows",
    ", they may play an important role through nonlinear interactions with the large - scale part of the flow . in many cases ,",
    "the small - scale dynamics of the fluids are instrumental in changing the transport properties of the large - scale dynamics of the fluids , and therefore it is relevant to identify potential instabilities in the microscale . at these small spatial scales ,",
    "the large scale velocity field can be reasonably approximated by a linear shear flow .",
    "the so - called shear - driven instabilities are those that originate as a result of the presence of a large - scale velocity shear .",
    "in this paper we study the potential relevance of the hall effect in the presence of an external magnetic field as well as a linear shear flow .",
    "in particular , we focus our attention on the following two types of flows with hall effect : ( a ) non - rotating shear flows leading to what we call hall magneto - shear instability ( hall - msi ) ; and ( b ) differententially rotating flows leading to hall magneto - rotational instability ( or hall - mri ) . in the absence of both rotation and shear , the linear modes in hall - mhd correspond to right - hand polarized _ whistlers _ and left - hand polarized _ ion - cyclotron _ waves ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "when these modes propagate embedded in a shear flow , the ion - cyclotron mode might become unstable .",
    "this instability takes place when the shear is steep enough to be larger than the ion - cyclotron frequency .",
    "a linear analysis of this instability has been recently reported by @xcite , for the case of weakly ionized plasmas .",
    "another study on the influence of the hall effect on weakly ionized plasmas subjected to differential rotation , was reported by @xcite for finite magnetic reynolds numbers up to @xmath12 ( see also @xcite ) .    in the present study",
    "we adopt a one - dimensional configuration , perform a linear analysis to identify potential instabilities and then compare with numerical simulations .",

    "the dispersion relation for the linear regime is shown in  [ sec : disprel ] .",
    "we briefly describe the numerical code employed in  [ sec : simul ] .",
    "the role of the hall effect on non - rotating shear flows is presented in  [ sec : hmsi ] , while the action of hall currents on the well known magneto - rotational instability is discussed in  [ sec : hmri ] .",

    "[ scatter_hmsi ] , which corresponds to hall - msi , it seems apparent that , regardless of the values of the hall parameter , the eigenvectors for the velocity field and the current density are always aligned thus extending the result shown in eq .",
    "( [ theta_hmsi ] ) to the nonlinear regime as well .",
    "similarly , fig .",
    "[ scatter_hmri ] shows that for hall - mri the velocity field and the current density are always anti - aligned as we numerically find in the linear regime .    in both cases , we note that the influence of the non - linear terms becomes non - negligible whenever the density fluctuations reach about ten percent of the mean value . in particular , the regime becomes strongly nonlinear when the velocity is equal to the alfvn speed . in the super - alfvnic regime , for hall - msi with strong hall effect the whole system seems to start reaching a saturation state and for hall - mri with negative of the hall parameter the system seems to reach saturation .    also , the field configurations in the non - linear stage depend on the value of the hall parameter . in the hall - mri case for @xmath194 ,",
    "the @xmath36-component of the current density is larger than the @xmath37-component , while for @xmath98 the inverse situation occurs . in both cases ,",
    "the system shows the formation of the current sheet in the larger component . for the mhd case , of course ,",
    "the electron and proton velocities are the same . in this case ,",
    "current sheets are present in the @xmath195 and @xmath196 directions . in the hall - msi case with moderate hall parameter value ,",
    "current sheets seem to appear in both directions .    in figs .",
    "[ profiles_hmsi ] and [ profiles_hmri ] the profiles of the density and the vector fields @xmath42 ( solid black line ) , @xmath197 ( solid gray line ) , @xmath198 ( dashed gray line ) , and @xmath43 ( dotted black line ) are shown in the nonlinear regime as functions of @xmath77 for hall - msi and for hall - mri , respectively . negative ( positive ) values of the hall parameter imply that the electron velocity is always smaller ( larger ) than the proton velocity .",
    "a more extreme situation takes place in the hall - msi case being the proton velocity very much larger than the electron velocity .",
    "in particular , for strong hall effect this is clearly shown in fig",
    ".  [ profiles_hmsi ] ( lower panels ) .",
    "in addition , the hall - mri case for positive values of the hall parameter seems to show the formation of two - flow jets .",
    "these double jet structures have also been reported by @xcite in 2d simulations .",
    "it is relevant to note that the @xmath77-component of the velocities start to increase when the density fluctuations grow and the non - linear regime is reached .",
    "however , this component of the velocities ( for protons and electrons ) remains negligible .",
    "[ profiles_hmsi ] and [ profiles_hmri ] also show that the longitudinal modes for protons and electrons are exactly overlapped .",
    "meanwhile , the @xmath77-component of the magnetic field and the current density are approximately zero .",
    "moreover , the maximum values of the density are correlated with the maximum of the perpendicular velocities and with the maximum of the current density , i.e.  zero magnetic field . meanwhile , the minimum values of density are in relation with the zeroes of the velocity fields and current density , i.e.  maximum magnetic field ( see figs .",
    "[ profiles_hmsi ] and [ profiles_hmri ] ) .",
    "even though the nonlinear regimes discussed in this section show interesting features , many of them might change when we extend our simulations to three dimensions .",
    "the purpose of this 1d study was to identify different regimes in the space of parameters of the problem .",
    "the present work is a comprehensive study of the instabilities arising from the interplay between the hall effect and a linear shear flow for a one - dimensional model . in other words ,",
    "we analyze the role of the hall effect in shear - driven instabilities . we find that an instability develops when the hall effect is present , which we term hall magneto - shear instability . also , we recover the magneto - rotational instability , as a particular case , and we quantitatively evaluate the influence of the hall currents on it .    more specifically ,",
    "we investigate the stability of the system in the parameter space set by the wavenumber and the hall parameter . in non - rotating plasmas , we determine the region in the @xmath120 diagram where the hall magneto - shear instability takes place . in rotating plasmas ( such as accretion disks ) , we examine three cases : sub - keplerian , keplerian , and super - keplerian . for each rotation profile , we establish the region in the @xmath120 diagram where the hall magneto - rotational instability occurs .",
    "the standard mri is recovered in the particular case for zero hall parameter ( @xmath103 ) . in both unstable modes , we find a very good agreement between the theoretical model and the numerical simulations .",
    "in addition , we explore the influence of the plasma parameter in two asymptotic cases : @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "we find that the linear behavior is independent of this parameter . in the non - linear stage of the large beta regimes ,",
    "the flow dynamics seems to evolve like in an mhd system .",
    "whitin the framework of astrophysics , the hall magneto - shear instability could be relevant in the interface between a jet and the surrounding environment where a strong shear is present .",
    "astrophysical jets have a very high degree of collimation , probably as a consequence of the presence of magnetic fields . the one - dimensional model adopted in this work ,",
    "even though quite simple , might properly describe this circumstance : the azimuthal component of the helicoidal velocity field arround the jet can be represented as a function of the radial direction and fulfills the periodicity condition in a straightforward fashion .",
    "the relevant instability in these strongly sheared flows is kelvin - helmholtz , which is a purely hydrodynamic instability .",
    "the presence of external magnetic fields modify the corresponding growth rate , depending on their strength and spatial orientation , but typical numbers quoted in the literature remain a small fraction of the imposed velocity shear ( @xcite and @xcite for results from hall - mhd simulations ) .",
    "therefore , the hall magneto - shear instability , with maximum groth rate of @xmath199 times the externally imposed shear , is definitely relevant in these strongly sheared flows . on the other hand",
    ", it seems clear that a three dimensional extension of the present study is necessary for a more realistic description of this instability , especially when it comes to its nonlinear stage .",
