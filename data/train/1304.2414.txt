    "the computation of indefinite elliptic problems often involves certain conditions on the mesh size @xmath2 for the system to be well - posed and for the derivation of error estimates .",
    "the first results on this problem are due to schatz @xcite .",
    "the conditions on the mesh parameter can be avoided if a stabilised finite element method is used .",
    "such methods have been proposed by bramble et al .",
    "@xcite or more recently the continuous interior penalty ( cip ) method for the helmholtz equation suggested by wu et al .",
    "the method proposed herein has some common features with both these methods , but appears to have a wider field of applicability .",
    "we may treat not only symmetric indefinite problems such as the ( real valued ) helmholtz equation , but also nonsymmetric indefinite problems such as convection  diffusion problems with non - solenoidal convection velocity or the cauchy problem .",
    "the latter problem is known to be ill - posed in general @xcite and will mainly be explored numerically herein .",
    "for all these cases we show that if the primal and adjoint problems admit a unique solution with sufficient smoothness the proposed algorithm converges with optimal order .",
    "the case of hyperbolic problems is treated in the companion paper @xcite .",
    "the idea of this work is to assume ill - posedness of the discrete form of the pde and regularise it in the form of an optimisation problem under constraints .",
    "indeed we seek to minimise the size of the stabilisation operator under the constraint of the discrete variational form .",
    "the regularisation terms are then chosen from well known stabilised methods respecting certain design criteria given in an abstract analysis .",
    "this leads to an extended method where simultaneously both a primal and a dual problem are solved , but where the exact solution of the dual problem is always trivial .",
    "the aim is to obtain a method where possible discrete non - uniqueness is alleviated by discrete regularisation , with a non - consistency that can be controlled so that optimal convergence for smooth solutions is obtained .",
    "the method is also a good candidate for cases where the solution to the continuous problem is non - unique , but that is beyond the scope of the present paper .    in spite of the lack of coercivity for the physical problem",
    ", the discrete problem has partial coercivity on the stabilisation operator .",
    "a consequence of this is that , depending on the kernel of the stabilisation operator a unique discrete solution may often be shown to exist independently of the underlying partial differential equation .",
    "this can be helpful when exploring ill - posed problems numerically or when measurement errors in the data , may lead to an ill - posed problem , although the true problem is well posed .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows , in section [ sec : abstract ] we propose an abstract method and prove that the method will have optimal convergence under certain assumptions on the bilinear form .",
    "then in section [ sec : stabilisation ] we discuss stabilised methods that satisfy the assumptions of the abstract theory with particular focus on the galerkin least squares method ( gls ) and the continuous interior penalty method ( cip ) .",
    "three example of applications are given in section [ sec : applications ] , two different noncoercive transport problems in compressible flow fields and one elliptic cauchy problem .",
    "finally in section [ sec : numerical ] the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method is shown by some computations of solutions to the problems discussed in section [ sec : applications ] .",
    "in particular we study the performance of the approach for some different cauchy problems of varying difficulty .",

    "the boundary of @xmath3 will be denoted @xmath6 and its normal @xmath7 . for simplicity",
    "we will reduce the scope to second order elliptic problems , but the methodology can readily be extended to indefinite elliptic problems of any order , providing the operator has a smoothing property .",

    "we let @xmath8 denote two subspaces of @xmath9 .",
    "the abstract weak formulation of the continuous problem takes the form : find @xmath10 such that @xmath11 with formal adjoint : find @xmath12 such that @xmath13 the bilinear form @xmath14 is assumed to be elliptic , but neither symmetric nor coercive .",

    "the semi - norms on @xmath76 and @xmath77 associated to the stabilisation is defined by @xmath78 the rationale of this formulation is that the following partial coercivity is obtained by taking @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , satisfying and also that the following continuity relations hold for all @xmath83 and for all @xmath84 @xmath85 and @xmath86 we have introduced the notation @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , for semi - norms to be defined .",
    "these norms , and those induced by the stabilisation operators , will be assumed to satisfy the approximation estimates @xmath90 and the additional upper bounds @xmath91 here @xmath92 depends on the form @xmath53 and a stabilisation parameter @xmath93 .",

    "the need to control a low order contribution of the dual solution @xmath69 above usually comes from oscillation of data . either in the form of stabilisation terms that do not account for oscillation within the element or error in the numerical quadrature .    in case",

    "the choice @xmath146 in the first term in the left hand side of results in a least squares term on the ( homogeneous ) residual over the element .",
    "it follows that the stabilisation relies on two mechanisms : @xmath1-control of the element residual and @xmath1-control of the gradient jumps over element edges",
    ". if higher order differential equations are considered , jumps of higher derivatives must be added .",
    "the design criterion - makes it straightforward to adapt the analysis below to a range of stabilisation methods , such as galerkin least squares , orthogonal sub - scales , continuous interior penalty or discontinuous galerkin methods . for the discontinuous galerkin method the penalty must act on the jump of @xmath70 itself and on the jump of the normal gradient . in all cases",
    "however the jumps of the gradient must be penalised , or an equivalent stabilisation operator introduced .",
    "it therefore seems natural to consider two stabilisations in more detail , first the gls - stabilisation combined with gradient penalty and then a cip - stabilisation purely based on penalty on jumps of derivatives of the approximate solution .",
    "we introduce the stabilisation operators @xmath147 and @xmath148 where @xmath149 @xmath150 and @xmath151 here @xmath152 and @xmath153 denotes the jump of the gradient and the laplacian respectively over the face @xmath154 .",
    "note that for smooth @xmath71 , @xmath155 and hence @xmath156 showing that @xmath157 is known .",
    "the abstract analysis typically holds for the parameter choices @xmath158 or @xmath159 .",
    "note that the matrix stencil for finite element methods remains the same for both approaches , and therefore the cip - method seems more appealing in this context .",
    "eliminating the galerkin least squares term also reduces the computational effort since the same stabilisation is used for the primal and adjoint solution .",
    "if on the other hand a @xmath160-continuous approximation space is used , the jumps of the gradients may be omitted and the gls stabilisation might prove competitive , since integrations on the faces may then be avoided . below",
    "we will only consider the case where @xmath161 or some subset thereof , which will then be defined in each case .",
    "the gls - method is one of the most popular stabilised methods . to fix the ideas",
    "we will assume that the problems and are subject to homogeneous dirichlet conditions and well - posed , with @xmath162 .",
    "for the readers convenience we detail the lagrangian in this particular case @xmath163 we let @xmath164 the optimality conditions then write , find @xmath49 @xmath165 for all @xmath51 . here",

    "we assume that the physical parameters are all order unity for simplicity .",

    "we will now prove that the assumptions of proposition [ stab_conv ] and theorem [ main ] are satisfied for the formulation .",
    "we define the following semi - norms @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "let @xmath94 and @xmath95 be defined by the lagrange interpolator @xmath171 ( or any other @xmath172-stable interpolation operator that satisfies boundary conditions ) , and note that by we readily deduce the following approximation results for smooth enough functions @xmath71 @xmath173 and , by @xmath172-stability of the interpolation operator , @xmath174 this shows that and holds .",
    "it then only remains to show the continuities and .",
    "first we show the inequality for the second order elliptic problem we note that after an integration by parts and cauchy - schwarz inequality , @xmath175 similarly , to prove we integrate by parts in the opposite direction in the second order operator and obtain @xmath176    note that for the gls - method @xmath177 in and .",
    "this follows from the fact that the whole residual is considered in the stabilisation term .",
    "this nice feature however only holds under exact quadrature .",
    "when the integrals are approximated , the quadrature error may give rise to oscillation terms from data that introduces a non - zero contribution to @xmath178 .",
    "since in this case we must account for possible oscillation of the physical coefficients we postpone the detailed analysis to the examples below and here only discuss the general principle . in this case",
    "we use @xmath179 in the general expressions for the stabilisation and .",
    "the parameters @xmath180 , @xmath181 are stabilisation coefficients , the form of which will be problem specific and will be given for each problem below .",
    "the key observation is that the following discrete approximation result holds for suitably chosen @xmath180 in @xmath182 ( see @xcite ) @xmath183 here @xmath184 is some piecewise affine interpolant of the velocity vector field @xmath185 and @xmath186 is the quasi - interpolation operator defined in each node of the mesh as a straight average of the function values from simplices sharing that node ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xmath187 with @xmath188 .",
    "using one may prove that @xmath189 it immediately follows that and are satisfied .",
    "we will leave the discussion of - and to the applications below , giving the explicit form for @xmath178 for each case . here",
    "we instead proceed with an abstract analysis , assuming that all physical parameters are of order @xmath190 .",
    "we choose @xmath94 and @xmath95 as the @xmath1-projection in order to exploit orthogonality to `` filter '' the element residual.let @xmath87 and @xmath88 have the same definition as in the gls case and define @xmath191 then we proceed similarly as for gls , but we use the orthogonality of the @xmath1-projection , ignoring here the contribution from boundary terms .",
    "it then follows using the orthogonality of the projection that formally @xmath192 similarly , to prove we integrate by parts in the opposite direction in the second order operator and use the @xmath1-orthogonality to obtain @xmath193 the last inequality follows by adding and subtracting @xmath71 in the last norm in the right hand side to obtain @xmath194 .",
    "this term is then split using a triangular inequality and the approximation error integrated in the @xmath195 term . to use the @xmath1-projection in this fashion",
    "we must impose the boundary conditions weakly so that the boundary degrees of freedom are included in @xmath76 .",
    "for the gls - method one has the choice between weak and strong imposition of boundary condition . in the next section",
    "we will discuss how weakly imposed boundary conditions are included in the formulation .",
    "to impose weak boundary conditions in this framework we propose a nitsche type method .",
    "however our formulation differs from the standard nitsche boundary conditions in several ways :    * both dirichlet and neumann conditions are imposed using penalty .",
    "* there is no lower bound of the parameter for the imposition of dirichlet type boundary conditions .",
    "this is related to the fact that the method never uses the coercivity of @xmath52 .",
    "* nitsche type boundary terms are added to @xmath52 in order to ensure consistency and adjoint consistency , but the penalty is added to the operators @xmath57 and @xmath56 , allowing for different boundary penalty for the primal and the adjoint . as we shall see below for some problems",
    "this is the only way to make the nitsche formulation consistent .",
    "if the primal and the dual problems have a dirchlet boundary condition on @xmath196 this is imposed by @xmath197 where @xmath53 is defined by equation and by adding the boundary penalty term @xmath198 to @xmath57 and @xmath56 with @xmath199 . in the non - homogeneous case",
    "the suitable data is added to the right hand side in the standard way . for neumann conditions on @xmath200 in both the primal and the adjoint problems ,",

    "the semi - norm @xmath205 can be a norm in certain situations so that the partial coercivity implies the well - posedness of the linear system . in the following proposition",
    "we discuss some basic sufficient conditions for the matrix to be invertible in the case of piecewise affine approximation spaces .",
    "for particular cases other geometric arguments may prove fruitful as we shall see in the second example below .",

    "the same argument leads to both @xmath218 and @xmath219 .    for the third case",
