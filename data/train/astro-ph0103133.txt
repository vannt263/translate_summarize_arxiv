    "the abundance anomalies in c , n , o , na and al found in red - giant stars in gcs are often attributed in part to the rotationally driven mixing of nucleosynthesized material from the vicinity of the hydrogen shell out to the stellar surface ( kraft 1994 ) .",
    "it has been frequently suggested that such mixing and rotation might impact the subsequent hb evolution particularly in regard to the 2nd parameter effect .",
    "perhaps the best evidence for this possibility comes from the 2nd parameter clusters m3 and m13 . in m13",
    "one finds evidence for extensive mixing on the rgb , high hb rotation velocities and a very blue hb morphology , while in m3 there is less mixing on the rgb , lower hb rotation velocities and a redder hb morphology .    how would rotation and mixing affect a star s evolution ?",
    "since rotation delays the helium flash at the tip of the rgb , it would lead to a larger helium - core mass and greater mass loss .",
    "consequently a rotating star would be both bluer and brighter on the hb than its non - rotating counterpart . in the case of mixing one",
    "must distinguish between `` shallow '' mixing , which does not penetrate into the hydrogen shell , and `` deep '' mixing , which does .",
    "`` shallow '' mixing would have little , if any , effect on the hb .",
    "in contrast , `` deep '' mixing into the shell would increase the envelope helium abundance as well as the luminosity ( and hence mass loss ) at the tip of the rgb .",
    "the net effect of both rotation and `` deep '' mixing is to produce a bluer and brighter hb morphology .",
    "rich et al . ( 1997 ) discovered that the hbs in ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 possess prominent blue extensions not found in other metal - rich gcs .",
    "quite remarkably , these hbs also slope upward with decreasing from the red clump to the top of the blue tail . using canonical hb models , sweigart & catelan ( 1998 , hereafter sc98 ) demonstrated that differences in age or mass loss along the rgb - two popular 2nd parameter candidates - can not explain the hb morphology of these gcs .",
    "however , sc98 did find that deep mixing and rotation could produce upward sloping hbs similar to those observed in these clusters .",
    "one scenario not considered by sc98 was a spread in metallicity within ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 , a possibility first raised by piotto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in order to explore this scenario in detail , we have evolved sequences from the main sequence through the hb phase for a range in [ fe / h ] from @xmath20.5 ( the approximate metallicity of ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 ) to @xmath22.3 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that all models are coeval and that the reimers mass loss parameter @xmath3 is the same for all [ fe / h ] .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , the zero - age hb ( zahb ) for these variable metallicity tracks is about 0.4 mag brighter than the canonical zahb for [ fe / h ] = @xmath20.5 at the top of the blue tail . when translated into the observational ( @xmath4 , ) plane",
    ", we would expect the hb defined by the tracks in figure 1 to slope upward by about the amount observed in ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 .",
    "these results suggest that ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 might be metal - rich analogues of @xmath0 cen , the only other gc known to contain a spread in metallicity .",
    "blue hb stars in the temperature range @xmath5 generally have lower surface gravities than predicted by canonical models when their spectra are analyzed using stellar atmospheres with the cluster metallicity . deep mixing",
    "was initially suggested as a possible explanation for this low gravity offset .",
    "however , it is now known that radiative levitation of heavy elements can increase [ fe / h ] in the atmospheres of these stars to solar or super solar values .",
    "most of the low gravity problem disappears when these stars are analyzed with metal - rich atmospheres ( moehler et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "a number of interesting phenomena occur in hb stars around a temperature of @xmath6 k including the onset of radiative levitation , a shift to lower surface gravities , a drop in rotation velocities , a jump in the strmgren u magnitudes , and in some gcs a gap in the hb distribution .",
    "these phenomena may be related to the disappearance of surface convection and hence to the formation of a more stable stellar atmosphere .",
    "as illustrated in figure 2 , hb stars cooler than log @xmath7    have deep convective envelopes .",
    "hotter than this temperature , the envelope convection breaks into distinct shells associated with the ionization of h and he .",
    "note that the surface convection disappears at @xmath6 k.    kraft , r. p. 1994",
