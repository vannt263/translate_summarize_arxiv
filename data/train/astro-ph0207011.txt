    "groups of galaxies are the poorest systems of clusters of galaxies .",
    "since the number of member galaxies is quite small , individual galaxies could have great effects on the group properties .",
    "many groups of galaxies have been found to contain a significant amount of x - ray emitting hot gas with a temperature of @xmath41 kev ( ponman , bertram 1993 ; mulchaey et al .",
    "rosat observations revealed that the x - ray luminosity and mass of hot gas scatter widely with a range of 2 orders of magnitude , although their galaxy mass is similar within a factor of @xmath45 ( mulchaey et al .",
    "1996 , 2000 ) .",
    "ponman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) claimed that this scatter is caused by a steep relation between the temperature and the x - ray luminosity , indicating the action of galactic winds to the hot gas .",
    "the metal abundance is also different with a range of 0.051 solar among groups ( fukazawa et al .",
    "1996 ; davis et al . 1999 ) , in contrast to a small scatter of 0.20.4 solar for rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "they speculated that the shallow potential can not bind metal - rich gas ejected from member galaxies .",
    "this scenario is also supported by the low si - to - fe abundance ratio of groups , as compared with rich clusters ( fukazawa et al .",
    "however , we have not yet understood the cause of significant scatters in metal abundances and in the hot gas - to - stellar mass ratio . in order to resolve this issue , further x - ray investigations of groups of galaxies",
    "are needed .",
    "it has been reported that some correlations exist among the physical parameters of groups , such as the galaxy velocity dispersion , optical luminosity , x - ray luminosity , x - ray temperature , and so on ( ponman et al .",
    "1996 ; helsdon , ponman 2000 ; helsdon et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in the past observations ,",
    "the temperature and metal abundance have been measured mainly for groups of galaxies whose member galaxies are dominated by elliptical ones .",
    "this is due to the x - ray faintness of ones dominated by spiral galaxies ( mulchaey et al .",
    "why are spiral - dominant groups of galaxies x - ray faint ?",
    "how much hot gas is there in such groups ?",
    "how high is the metal abundance of hot gas in such groups ?",
    "these are important questions to understand concerning how member galaxies have a relation with a hot intragroup medium . in the past",
    ", only one spiral - dominant group of galaxies has shown reasonably bright intergalactic x - ray emission .",
    "this is hcg 92 , famous as the stephan s quintet , which contains a significant amount of hot intragroup medium ( sulentic et al .",
    "1995 ; awaki et al .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is @xmath5 erg s@xmath2 , and the gas - to - stellar mass ratio is @xmath40.1",
    ". there is another possible evidence of a hot intragroup medium in the spiral - dominant group hcg 16 ( ponman et al .",
    "1996 ) , although its x - ray properties are not well known .",
    "since the sample is still too poor for the purpose described above , we planned to perform asca ( tanaka et al .",
    "1994 ) observations of a spiral - dominant group of galaxies .",
    "hcg 57 is one of the hickson compact galaxy groups ( hickson et al .",
    "1988 ; hickson 1993 ) at a redshift of 0.0304 .",
    "it contains eight original member galaxies in the hickson catalog , as tabulated in tables 1 and 2 . for a comparison , an x - ray bright elliptical - dominant galaxy group , hcg 51 ( fukazawa et al .",
    "1996 ) , is also shown .",
    "it can be seen that these two groups exhibit quite similar properties , such as redshift , galaxy velocity dispersion , galaxy density , optical luminosity , galaxy number , and group size .",
    "the most different feature is a morphology of dominant member galaxies .",
    "the brightest three galaxies of hcg 57 are spiral , while those of hcg 51 are elliptical or s0 .",
    "therefore , a comparison of the x - ray properties between hcg 57 and hcg 51 is valuable when considering the relation between the member galaxy morphology and the hot gas in groups .",
    "ponman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reported , based on a short serendipitous rosat pointed observation , that hcg 57 is an x - ray emitter with a luminosity of @xmath6 erg s@xmath2 and a temperature of @xmath7 kev .",
    "imaging information is , however , not available , possibly due to the poor data quality ; therefore , the existence of a hot intragroup medium is not known .",
    "we are especially interested in how much x - ray hot gas exists in hcg 57 , because hcg 51 was found to contain a large amount ot hot gas whose mass is comparable to the total stellar mass in member galaxies . note that the galaxy velocity dispersion of hcg 57 is high enough to bind hot gas gravitationally .",
    "this paper reports on the asca detection of x - ray emitting hot gas from hcg 57 .",
    "this is the second detailed x - ray analysis of such a spiral - dominant galaxy group after hcg 92 .",
    "we employed 90% confidence limits throughout this work , and used a hubble constant of 50 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "the solar abundances are taken from anders and grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "we observed hcg 57 on 1994 december 2325 , in the asca ao-3 phase , with effective times of 82 ks and 61 ks for the gis ( ohashi et al .",
    "1996 ; makishima et al .",
    "1996 ) and sis ( burke et al .",
    "1991 ) , respectively .",
    "the observation mode was the ph normal mode for the gis and the 2ccd faint mode for the sis .",
    "we accumulated the detected events under the condition of a telescope viewing direction of @xmath8 from the dark earth rim , and a magnetic cutoff rigidity of @xmath9 gv . moreover , we imposed the condition of a telescope viewing direction of @xmath10 from the bright earth rim for the sis data , in order to avoid the effect of light leakage on the ccd chips .",
    "we added all available data from different sensors and chips for the gis and the sis separately after an appropriate gain correction .",
    "the background data were taken from several blank - sky data , such as nep ( north ecliptic pole ) , draco , and qsf 3 fields ; we then subtracted them from the on - source spectra .",
    "figure 1 shows gis and sis images of hcg 57 in the 0.52.0 kev and 3.57.5 kev band .",
    "significant x - ray emission was detected around the hcg 57 region on both the gis and sis images in the 0.52.0 kev band .",
    "a point - like source was found toward the west of hcg 57 ; we could not find any objects around this source using the ned extragalactic data base .",
    "the source count rates within 5 arcmin of the group center are 0.005 count s@xmath2 and 0.006 count s@xmath2 for the gis and sis , respectively .",
    "the soft x - ray emission extends up to 5 arcmin , centered on the spiral galaxy ngc 3753 , which is the brightest member galaxy , and can not be explained by one point source when considering the asca psf .",
    "note that the steep decline of the sis x - ray brightness towards the west is due to a sensor gap between the ccd chips .",
    "compared with the asca result for hcg 51 ( fukazawa et al .",
    "1996 ) , the x - ray emission of hcg 57 is much fainter by an order of magnitude , regardless of their similar optical properties . there is marginal evidence of hard x - ray emission around the hcg 57 region on the gis image , apart from the northern point - like source located at @xmath11 arcmin of the group center . whether the x - ray source is point - like or extended can not be constrained due to poor statistics .",
    "low efficiency for hard x - ray and short exposure of the sis makes it difficult to detect faint hard x - ray emission .",
    "since the photon statistics is too poor to resolve spatially , we accumulated photons within 5 arcmin of the group center in order to make the spectrum . as shown in figure 2 , the thus - obtained spectra exhibit a significant fe - l line complex at around 1 kev , indicating the existence of hot x - ray gas .",
    "we first tried to fit the spectra with a single raymond ",
    "smith model ( raymond , smith 1977 ) with a galactic photoelectric absorption of @xmath12 @xmath13 ( stark et al .",
    "1992 ) , but a large residual remained in the hard band and the reduced @xmath14 was 1.69 .",
    "accordingly , we added a power - law model to represent the hard component ; the fitting results are shown in figure 2 .",
    "this model gives an improved fitting with a reduced @xmath14 of 1.08 , as summarized in table 3 .",
    "the temperature of the soft thermal component is @xmath15 kev , consistent with the rosat result .",
    "the metal abundance can not be constrained with a lower limit of 0.08 solar .",
    "the power - law photon index @xmath16 is constrained to be only @xmath17 .",
    "we fixed the metal abundance and power - law photon index to be 0.3 solar and 1.0 , respectively , and thus the x - ray flux becomes @xmath18 erg s@xmath2 @xmath13 in 0.510 kev .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of the soft thermal component and the hard power - law component are @xmath19 erg s@xmath2 ( 0.52 kev ) and @xmath20 erg s@xmath2 ( 210 kev ) .",
    "the combined luminosity of the soft and hard components agrees with the rosat result .",
    "the luminosity of the thermal component is only about 10% of that of the hcg 51 .",
    "the contribution of the northern source to the hard component is estimated to be at most 30% .",
    "the origin of the power - law component is unknown , noting that the hard component with a similar luminosity was also detected from hcg 51 ( fukazawa et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in order to estimate the mass of the thermal hot gas",
    ", we fitted the radial profile with the conventional @xmath21 model ( jones , forman 1984 ) .",
    "the free parameters were @xmath21 , the core radius @xmath22 , and the central gas density @xmath23 .",
    "we prepared radial count rate profiles in the energy range of 1.03.0 kev and 0.82.0 kev for the gis and sis , respectively , while considering the signal - to - noise ratios . with the asca instrumental full simulator , we modeled the radial count rate profile for specific parameters of the @xmath21 model , and compared it with the real data to minimize the @xmath14 value .",
    "a detailed explanation of the fitting is described in fukazawa ( 1997 ) .",
    "we performed simultaneous gis and sis fittings and obtained best - fit parameters of @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( 199 kpc ) , and @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "figure 3 shows the best - fit @xmath21 model and data in the radial count rate profile of the gis and sis .",
    "the gas mass and total mass are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , within 250 kpc ( @xmath30 ) . here",
    ", we chose this value for the cut - off radius because the x - ray emission is not significant over this radius .",
    "the stellar mass in the hcg 57 is derived from the optical blue luminosity of each galaxy ( table 2 ) , assuming a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath31 or @xmath32 for early type galaxies ( e / s0 ) or spiral galaxies , respectively ; and then , @xmath33 becomes @xmath34 .",
    "although total mass is somewhat small , it is typical for groups of galaxies ; also , the gas - to - stellar mass ratio of 0.3 seems to be relatively small in comparison with that of x - ray bright groups of galaxies , such as hcg 51 , which has a ratio of 1.0 ( fukazawa et al .",
    "however , the difference in the cut - off radius between hcg 51 and hcg 57 must be taken into account . due to the flatter gas density profile of hcg 57 than that of hcg 51 ,",
    "the gas mass could rise significantly .",
    "therefore , tracing the emission out to a larger radius is necessary to discuss the exact amount of hot gas .",
    "we observed a spiral - dominant group of galaxies , hcg 57 , with asca , and detected extended thermal x - ray emission with a temperature of 1 kev around hcg 57 , together with the hard x - ray component , whose extent can not be explained by one point source .",
    "soft thermal emission was not associated with the specific galaxy , but extended up to 5 arcmin ( @xmath4250 kpc ) .",
    "the luminosity and mass of the x - ray emitting thermal hot gas are @xmath19 erg s@xmath2 ( 0.510 kev ) and @xmath35 , respectively , within 5 arcmin of the group center .",
    "compared with the temperature and x - ray luminosity relation of groups of galaxies taken from xue and wu ( 2000 ) in figure 4 , the x - ray luminosity of hcg 57 is relatively low for a temperature of 1 kev , but still within the scatter .",
    "the ratios of the gas mass to stellar and total mass are 0.3 and 0.068 , respectively , both of which are somewhat smaller than that of rich clusters and x - ray bright groups .",
    "this gives us a precious detailed x - ray result for the spiral - dominant groups of galaxies after hcg 92 , and the third significant detection of x - ray emitting hot gas from such groups .",
    "according to the x - ray properties of the thermal hot gas such as extent , temperature , mass , and luminosity , we conclude that it is not an interstellar medium in a specific galaxy , but an intragroup medium bound gravitationally by the hcg 57 itself .",
    "the low mass and low luminosity of hot gas is consistent with groups whose spiral fraction is large ( mulchaey et al . 1996 ) .",
    "our results indicate that the x - ray low luminosity of spiral - dominant groups is not due to the lack of an intragroup medium for some systems . for hcg 57",
    ", the x - ray faintness is mostly attributed to quite a low central gas density of at most @xmath36 @xmath27 .",
    "this is also the same as in the case of hcg 16 ( ponman et al .",
    "we think that the high central gas density of hcg 92 is unusual for spiral - dominant groups because no other such objects are found .",
    "we claim that the amount of hot gas in hcg 57 is not extremely small compared with x - ray bright groups .",
    "therefore , it can be said that the gravitational potential of hcg 57 is deep enough to bind a significant amount of hot gas .",
    "this property differs from that for individual galaxies ; the amount of hot gas in individual spiral galaxies is much less than that in individual elliptical galaxies by two or three orders of magnitude .",
    "then , why are spiral - dominant groups always x - ray faint even if they contain massive hot gas ?",
    "a low gas density of @xmath37 @xmath27 , as in the case of hcg 57 , or a low gas temperature of @xmath38 kev is thought to be attributed .",
    "it is speculated that the environment of a low gas density makes spiral galaxies free from ram - pressure stripping , while a high gas density of bright groups of galaxies and rich clusters strips off the disk component of spiral galaxies to convert the morphology into s0 .",
    "the temperature of 1 kev for hot gas in the hcg 57 is typical for groups , and sufficiently high to bind a large amount of hot gas",
    ". such a deep gravitational potential has been mainly found for elliptical - dominant groups , and hcg 57 also shows a clear evidence of such a potential for spiral - dominant groups as hcg 92 .",
    "this implies that the gravitational potential or dark matter associated with groups of galaxies does not depend on the type of member galaxies .",
    "apart from the group - scale gravitational potential , a galaxy - scale potential must exist , inferred from the double-@xmath21 structure of the x - ray surface brightness around the group central galaxy ( ikebe et al .",
    "1996 ; mulchaey , zabludoff 1999 ) . for hcg 57",
    ", the measurement of the gravitational potential associated with central spiral galaxies is quite important , because it has not ever been performed with other methods .",
    "however , we can not resolve it because of poor spatial resolution ; and observation by chandra is hopefully awaited .",
    "a significant amount of metals in the hot gas is also found in hcg 57 .",
    "assuming that the metal abundance is 0.2 solar , the iron mass becomes @xmath39 .",
    "accordingly , the iron - mass - to - light ratio ( imlr ) is @xmath40 , which is small by a factor of 10 compared with that of rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "there are three early - type ( e / s0 ) galaxies in hcg 57 , and their total optical luminosity is @xmath41 .",
    "then , an imlr for only early type galaxies becomes @xmath42 .",
    "considering the imlr of @xmath43 for rich clusters , it is possible that the total iron in the hot gas was supplied mainly by these early type member galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , we suggested that spiral member galaxies also contribute to the iron enrichment of the hot gas because of their dominance in hcg 57 .",
    "the metal abundance ratio is an essential key to resolve this issue , and hence xmm / newton and astro - e2/xrs / xis observations with good photon statistics will enable us to measure it .    the hard x - ray component is also detected from hcg 57 .",
    "we can not determine whether this emission is point - like or extended .",
    "if extended , several possible mechanisms can be considered .",
    "one is inverse compton scattering via cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by high - energy electrons in the intragroup space , as suggested for several rich clusters ( e.g. fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 ) and hcg 62 group ( fukazawa et al . 2001 ; nakazawa 2001 ) .",
    "the similar x - ray luminosity of the hard component with that of hcg62 and hcg51 is also interesting when considering the origin ; the luminosity of the hard component does not depend on the luminosity of x - ray hot gas .",
    "for example , if the hard component is due to inverse compton scattering , high - energy electrons should exist .",
    "such electrons might be accelerated commonly in groups of galaxies through galaxy  galaxy or galaxy  plasma interactions ( nakazawa 2001 ) , and luminosity of the hard component is proportional to the amount of electrons not dependent on their distribution . on the other hand",
    ", the luminosity of the x - ray hot gas strongly depends on the gas distribution because it is a square measure of the hot gas density .",
    "therefore , the luminosity ratio of the soft and hard component can differ from groups to groups , and spiral - dominant groups could exhibit a clear hard component without being hindered by the soft component .",
    "anyway , it is important to measure the spatial distribution of the hard x - ray component in order to consider its origin .",
    "astro - e2/xis will enable us such measurements thanks to the large effective area and low background .",
