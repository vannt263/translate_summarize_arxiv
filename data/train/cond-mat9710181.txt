    "the collective excitations of the spins in the cuo@xmath4 planes of the high temperature superconductors display a plethora of behavior @xcite , perhaps as exotic as the bulk properties themselves .",

    "indeed , cooper pairing itself is a correlation between electron spins .",
    "a further motivation , especially in view of the unconventional pairing @xcite in these materials , is that the magnetic excitations may be involved in the pairing attraction .    in the present paper",
    "we review our recent measurements @xcite of the dynamic response over a wide frequency range i.e. up to energies of order @xmath8 .",
    "we find that in the superconductors there is significant spectral weight above the superconducting gap energy . for both superconductors studied",
    ", the magnetic response @xmath9 is actually stronger for frequencies just above @xmath10 than in the parent insulating antiferromagnet .",
    "we have been careful to convert our measurements into absolute units .",
    "this allows a systematic comparison between different systems , compositions and theories to be made .",
    "our experiments were performed using the het and mari spectrometers at the isis pulsed spallation neutron source of the rutherford appleton laboratory .",
    "het and mari are direct geometry chopper spectrometers .",
    "a pulse of neutrons of approximately 1  @xmath11s duration is produced when a 800  mev pulsed proton beam hits a tantalum target .",
    "the neutrons are monochromated using a fermi chopper at 10  m from the target and appropriately phased to the proton pulse .",
    "scattered neutrons are detected using 800 @xmath12he detectors 4  m from the sample .",
    "neutron scattering directly measures the imaginary part of the generalized magnetic susceptibility @xmath13 .",
    "the scattering cross - section for an isotropic system is @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15=0.2905 barn sr@xmath16   @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the incident and final neutron wavevectors and @xmath20 is the magnetic form factor .",
    "absolute unit conventions were performed by measuring the elastic incoherent scattering from a vanadium standard @xcite under the same experimental conditions and by measuring the low - frequency coherent phonon scattering from the sample @xcite . throughout this paper , we label momentum transfers @xmath21 in units of @xmath16 by their reciprocal space positions * q*=@xmath22= @xmath23 . following previous practice , we use the _ orthorhombic _ nomenclature to label reciprocal space in the la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 system and _ tetragonal _ nomenclature in the yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 system .",

    "of particular interest is the nature of the spin fluctuations @xcite for metallic and superconducting compositions .",
    "we have therefore studied the compounds la@xmath74sr@xmath75cuo@xmath3 ( a composition close to optimal doping ) and yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath76 ( an underdoped superconductor ) . in both cases",

    "this can be seen clearly when we extract and plot the local susceptibility in fig .",
    "[ lasrlocal](b ) .",
    "when we include low frequency data from a reactor - based experiment , it becomes clear that the local response is peaked near 22  mev .",

    "when we compare our measurements on the quantum antiferromagnets la@xmath4cuo@xmath3 and yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath25 , we find that , in both cases , linear spin - wave theory accounts well for the dispersion and amplitude variation . however , an overall renormalization of the amplitude @xmath32 must be included to account for the observed intensity of the one - magnon response .",
    "our observations agree with calculations of @xmath32=0.51 based on a @xmath38 expansion .",

    "the response of the copper spins obeys the sum rule , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the mean squared moment on the cu sites . in both superconductors studied here ,",
    "doping and the consequential metal - insulator transition led to a large redistribution of spectral weight and formation of a peak in @xmath80 at intermediate frequency . in the light of the sum rule , the existence of the peak in itself is not unexpected since spectral weight is lost from the bragg peak present in the insulator and the high frequency response is strongly suppressed .",
    "what is surprising is the relatively small energy scale over which the response is distributed compared with other paramagnetic metals .",
