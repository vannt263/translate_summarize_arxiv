    "observations of the galactic centre revealed one or two discs of @xmath2myr old stars orbiting the central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) at a distance of @xmath30.1pc @xcite .",
    "until now , a large number of studies have been carried out to investigate the dynamical behaviour of such stellar discs around smbhs .",
    "@xcite have shown that a single cold disc in the absence of a perturbing potential can not explain the observed large inclinations and eccentricities . @xcite",
    "have provided upper mass limits to the discs masses by studying the amount of warping of two discs at large inclination . in @xcite",
    "we have shown that a significant number of disc stars eventually achieve highly eccentric orbits due to kozai interaction , thus providing a mechanism to create the observed s - stars and hyper - velocity stars by disruption of close - passage binaries .",
    "all these simulations have been carried out neglecting the stellar cusp present in the vicinity of the smbh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argued that a smooth background potential hinders the creation of high eccentricities in full kozai cycles since it causes orbital precession . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have shown that relaxation processes in a grainy stellar cusp surrounding the smbh act on time scales comparable with the age of the stellar discs ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "they demonstrate that due to warping and relaxation , two highly inclined stellar discs can not be recognised as flat circular discs after 5myr of interaction .",
    "significant contributions arise from both two - body relaxation due to stellar encounters customary in star clusters , and _ resonant _ relaxation effects , an enhanced rate of relaxation of angular momentum in near - keplerian systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , both disc and cusp stars contribute significantly to the disc evolution .    considering the apparent importance of the influence of a stellar cusp on the disc evolution , in this paper we challenge the results of earlier studies by including both analytic and @xmath1-body cusp potentials in corresponding models . in section  [ sec : gcdci : cuspcomp ] , we discuss the structure of the stellar cusp as predicted by theory and derived from observations .",
    "section  [ sec : gcdci : models ] describes the numerical method underlying our integrations and our models of the stellar discs .",
    "we present our results with respect to the studies mentioned above in section  [ sec : gcdci : results ] and discuss them in section  [ sec : gcdci : discussion ] .",
    "the discs of young stars orbiting the smbh in the centre of the milky way are embedded in a population of old stars and stellar remnants .",
    "theoretical arguments and @xmath1-body simulations show that a stellar system around an smbh evolves into a cusp with a @xmath4 power - law density distribution @xcite .",
    "the density profile of the stellar cusp in the galactic centre is estimated from the observed luminosity profile and kinematics by @xcite as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the distance from the smbh , @xmath7 inside 0.22pc and @xmath8 outside 0.22pc .",
    "hence , the stellar cusp has a mass within 1.5pc comparable to the black hole mass .",
    "we use this result ( omitting the uncertainty specified ) when modelling the cusp as an analytic potential .",
    "however , as we will discuss with the results in section  [ sec : gcdci : results ] , relaxation between stars can play an important role in the highly dense central parsec of our galaxy .",
    "hence it is not sufficient to include such a smooth potential : to perform realistic simulations of disc dynamics in the galactic centre , it is required to consider stars and stellar remnants in the @xmath1-body calculations .    a model of the stellar population in the central 100pc of our galaxy",
    "is given by @xcite .",
    "due to dynamical friction causing massive stars to sink towards the centre , it can be assumed that the central few 0.1pc , where we also find the young stellar discs , are mass - dominated by the most massive components , namely stellar - mass black holes @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will analyse the dynamics of the stellar discs , which will be described in more detail in the next section .",
    "this restricts our interest to the potential within 1pc from the smbh . at 2pc from the centre",
    "@xcite found a rotating ring of gas of @xmath9 , the so - called circum - nuclear disc ( cnd ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that the torque exerted by the cnd may cause ( additional ) warping of a stellar disc at @xmath10pc from the smbh .",
    "furthermore , it may cause somewhat higher eccentricities due to kozai interaction ( cf .  section  [ sec : gcdci : sstars ] ) . throughout this paper",
    ", we will ignore the effect of the cnd .",
    "this leaves the stellar cusp as the only dynamical perturbation to the disc evolution .",
    "an exhaustive study of the dynamics of stars in the galactic centre will have to include the effects of the cnd .",
    "however , the general conclusions about the influence of a stellar cusp on the disc dynamics as discussed in this paper will remain unaffected .",
    "to test the mutual interaction of two stellar discs orbiting the central smbh , we performed direct @xmath1-body integrations using our bhint code @xcite . bhint has been developed specifically to calculate the dynamics of stars orbiting around an smbh , avoiding the large secular error other @xmath1-body codes based on the hermite scheme @xcite accumulate in case of the highly eccentric orbits and extreme mass ratios present in the galactic centre .",
    "bhint integrates the equation of motion of a star orbiting an smbh by moving it along the keplerian orbit and adding the forces from other components ( disc stars and cusp black holes ) as perturbations .",
    "it solves kepler s equation analytically ( and thus without secular error ) to determine the orbital motion around the dominating smbh , which is assumed to rest at the origin of the coordinate system , while using the hermite scheme to integrate the perturbing forces .",
    "bhint includes special treatment of close encounters and fast approaches to allow for high precision .",
    "in addition , it comprises post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation of the effects of general relativity up to order 2.5 following @xcite , which is added to the perturbations .",
    "however , since the pn terms need relatively high accuracy and thus a significant amount of computational time , we usually switch on these terms only in integrations of highly eccentric orbits , where pericentre - shift becomes important ( see table  [ tab : params ] ) .",
    "for example , @xcite have shown that in the regime of the stellar discs , pericentre shift due to the spherical cusp is at least one order of magnitude more effective than the relativistic one , as long as the eccentricity is below @xmath11 .",

    "@xcite have shown that a single cold disc in the absence of a perturbing potential can not explain the observed large inclinations and eccentricities .",

    "figure  [ fig:1disc - e - i ] shows the time evolution of eccentricity and inclination of a single disc in a stellar cusp ( ` 1a ` ) . in line with the results of @xcite",

    "@xcite have shown how the mutual interaction of two discs with large relative inclination leads to an increase of disc thickness .",
    "the evolution of orbital eccentricities and inclination ( i.e.  disc warping ) in the presence of a cusp has been studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "they find that while the evolution of orbital inclinations is dominated by the discs potential ( precession and warping ) , the change in eccentricity and semi - major axis of the disc stars is driven by non - resonant as well as resonant relaxation with disc and cusp stars .    here",

    "[ fig : warp],width=313 ]    figure  [ fig : warp ] shows the orientation of the orbital planes of the disc stars after an integration time of 5myr . since precession is dominated by the disc potentials , direction and amount of warping do not depend significantly on the cusp . on the other hand , the distribution of eccentricities does depend on the surrounding cusp : figure  [ fig : eacomp ] shows the final distribution of the disc stars eccentricities as a function of semi - major axis , for both single - disc and two - disc setup . while the overall eccentricity distribution is similar in all cases , eccentricities @xmath49",
    "are only achieved in the presence of a stellar cusp , or in a two disc setup without any cusp potential ( at the very inner edge ) . as we will discuss in section",
    "[ sec : gcdci : sstars ] , while high eccentricities reached by long - term kozai interaction with the two discs are impeded by an analytic cusp , relaxation processes in a stellar cusp ( cf .",
    "* ) can lead to eccentricities high enough for short - term resonances to be effective despite the spherical potential , thus explaining the high eccentricities in three of our six cases ( two discs in the absence of a cusp , or one or two discs interacting with cusp remnants ) .          as a direct result of the disc warping described in the previous section , @xcite have provided upper mass limits to the discs masses considering their apparent flatness as measured by @xcite after a few myr of interaction .",
    "however , @xcite did not find convincing evidence for a counter - clockwise disc as flat as 19@xmath23 , which can also be interpreted as an indication for a higher mass of the massive disc in a two - disc model .",
    "@xcite have extended the argument of warping as a mere measure of disc thickening by measuring the warping angle as a function of radial distance and found good agreement of a two - disc model with the observations , showing how the warping angle can reach 50@xmath23 already at 0.15pc from the smbh .",
    "here we calculated different models with two discs of stars following a canonical imf from @xmath39 .",
    "using binary fractions of 40 and 13 per cent implies total masses of 27000  ( ` 3a ` ) and 21500  ( ` 3b ` ) , respectively , to have the same number of massive stars .",

    "* ) reduces the initial disc mass by 20 per cent ( ` 3c ` ) , since a larger fraction of massive stars survives the shorter disc age , and thus a smaller initial number of massive stars is needed to explain the observed 77 stars . in another model ( ` 3d ` ) , we choose the initial disc mass to be consistent with the canonical imf @xcite down to 0.01 , resulting in 80 per cent more mass than with a cut - off at 1 . to keep the total number of stars low",
    ", we had to replace the low - mass stars ( @xmath50 ) by 1  stars of equal total mass .",
    "again , the overall spiral trend of disc warping as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : imf1 ] is similar to the earlier results .",
    "figure [ fig : imf2 ] shows the angle between a disc fitted to massive stars at a certain radius and the outermost fitted disc . while the amount of warping of all clockwise ( massive ) discs modelled with a canonical imf is compatible with the observed values ( or even below ; cf .",
    "discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the integration results of the counter - clockwise disc fit the observations well only outside @xmath51pc from the smbh .",
    "inside this distance , the counter - clockwise disc dissolves , and thus the warping angle is no longer a smooth function of central distance .",
    "however , it is essential to note that the observed stars are assigned to one of the two discs depending on whether they are moving clockwise or counter - clockwise in the sky , since there is no other way to tell their disc of origin .",
    "this implies that none of the squares on the northern hemisphere of fig .",
    "[ fig : imf1 ] would be considered for determining the warping angles of the counter - clockwise disc .",
    "furthermore , more stars observed within 0.16pc from sgr  a@xmath52  move on projected radial orbits ( and are thus completely dismissed ) than on projected counter - clockwise orbits . if these ( and even some of the clockwise - moving stars ) stem from the more strongly warped counter - clockwise disc , they might significantly increase the amount of warping of the observed counter - clockwise disc .",
    "we waive a further analysis since assignment of stars to one of the two discs is rather uncertain in the inner 0.16pc with the currently available observational data .",
    "in addition , the choice of the line of sight in our models is arbitrary .    .",
    "[ fig : imf1],width=313 ]    -thickness of the fitted planes , respectively .",
    "the corresponding error bars for the simulations are generally smaller and thus omitted for clarity ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in none of our models",
    "does the amount of warping of the clockwise disc exceed the observed value .",
    "the modelled counter - clockwise discs dissolve towards the inner part , where in most cases warping is no longer a smooth function of central distance . [",
    "fig : imf2],width=313 ]    considering this and the fact that there is as yet no model explaining all of the observed features of the young stars and including all perturbations like e.g.  the cnd , we conclude that these models are still consistent with the observations .",
    "this seems to be in contrast to the results of @xcite , however they used stellar discs only out to 0.2pc from the smbh , while more than one third of the stars listed by @xcite are further away from sgr  a@xmath52 .",
    "in addition , they did not distinguish between stars in the outer parts of the discs which almost retain their orbital planes , and stars close to the centre which strongly precess .",
    "our results show that a canonical imf over the range @xmath53 can not be excluded dynamically for the young discs in the galactic centre .",
    "@xcite find a flat imf from analysing the @xmath54-band luminosity function of the disc stars ; however , they assume a lower mass limit of 20  for the observed stars , and their estimate of the disc age of @xmath2myr limits the initial masses of the now observed stars to @xmath55 , so this slope refers to a fairly small mass interval only .",
    "@xcite find a best fit of observations in the central parsec of our galaxy with a model of continuous star formation with a top - heavy imf .",
    "furthermore , @xcite argue that the x - ray luminosity of the sgr  a@xmath52  field is one order of magnitude too low to account for the number of young @xmath56 stars expected from a canonical imf , considering the large number of o - stars observed in the discs .",
    "this can also be explained by a higher low - mass cutoff of the imf at of the order of 1 .",
    "@xcite find that eccentricities as high as @xmath57 can only be explained by a top - heavy imf when assuming a circular disc origin , however they neglect the influence of the cusp and the second disc as elaborated by @xcite ; both suggest an eccentric disc origin for the counter - clockwise system",
    ". simulated star formation of gaseous discs suggests that stars form with a top - heavy imf only if the cooling times are just as large as allowed to still induce disc fragmentation ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "unfortunately , theoretical imf predictions have failed in the past to correctly describe the observations near the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "another argument for a top - heavy imf arises from the relation between disc and cusp mass . assuming that we do not live in a special time ,",
    "the formation of stellar discs in the galactic centre must be a frequent event .",
    "to explain the observed number of @xmath58 disc stars at an assumed age of 5myr with the @xmath28 imf suggested by @xcite , a total initial disc mass of @xmath59 is required , of which a mass of @xmath60 ends up in stellar remnants . using the canonical imf requires a total initial disc mass of @xmath61 , of which @xmath62 in remnants and low - mass stars are retained over a hubble time . assuming that most stars survive in the central region ( or are replaced by inspiralling massive remnants ) , the observed cusp mass of @xmath63 in the central 0.5pc @xcite allows for the formation of discs like those observed every 50myr for a top - heavy imf , and only every 500myr for a canonical imf .",
    "the fact that we observe very young stellar discs thus seems much more unlikely if star formation in the galactic centre follows the canonical imf .",
    "however , it may also be an indication of recently enhanced star formation processes .",
    "for example , if the galactic bar is young , as an increased fraction of barred galaxies for lower redshifts suggests @xcite , bar - induced gas inflow may explain such an enhancement ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we conclude that while theoretical star formation arguments and some observations indicate a top - heavy imf in the centre of the milky way , our self - consistent models of stellar dynamics allow the existence of a canonical imf as well .",
    "the observational evidence clearly needs to be improved by star counts , while the theory of star formation is currently not able to make conclusive statements on the imf of stars in the galactic centre ( see @xcite for a discussion of recent failures of imf theory ) .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that a significant number of disc stars eventually achieve highly eccentric orbits due to kozai interaction , thus providing a natural mechanism to create the observed s - stars and hyper - velocity stars by disruption of close - passage binaries .",
    "however , @xcite remarked that the effects of pericentre shift due to relativistic precession and a spherical cusp can destroy the kozai mechanism .",
    "while the relativistic precession period decreases strongly with increasing orbital eccentricity , @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 , @xmath44 and @xmath66 are the orbital period , semi - major axis , and eccentricity , respectively ) , they showed that cusp precession at a given distance is most effective for near - circular orbits : @xmath67 ( both equations assuming @xmath68 and the cusp profile inside 0.22pc by @xcite ) . from this",
    "we conclude that the very high eccentricities in kozai resonance are prevented by relativistic precession at high eccentricities and by cusp precession at low eccentricities .    figure  [ fig : kozai ] shows the eccentricity evolution during kozai resonance for integrations of a three - body problem with and without a cusp , and with and without pn treatment for relativistic effects .",
    "it is clearly seen that the pn terms prevent higher eccentricities when a certain eccentricity threshold is reached ( in this case @xmath69 ) , while their effect on the rest of the kozai cycle is not dramatic .",
    "this can be understood by general relativity being most effective for high eccentricities ( and thus small pericentre distances ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the changes on both maximum eccentricity and kozai period exerted by a stellar cusp are quite low , until a certain mass threshold of the cusp is reached , which prevents not only the highest eccentricities but essentially any significant eccentricity increase and thus the complete kozai cycle . even for the innermost disc stars ( @xmath70pc )",
    ", we find this threshold to be at only a few per cent of the cusp mass given by @xcite : while the 1 per cent curve reaches @xmath71 , the 5 per cent curve does not exceed @xmath72 .",
    "smbh with semi - major axes of 0.04pc and 0.16pc , respectively , resulting in the star s orbital period of 400yr .",
    "we calculate models without cusp ( solid black line ) , one per cent ( dashed line ) , and five per cent ( dotted line ) of the extended cusp mass observed in the galactic centre ( modelled as a smooth potential ) .",
    "each curve is accompanied by a corresponding thick green curve which represents a respective integration including post - newtonian terms up to 2.5 pn to account for the effects of general relativity .",
    "while relativistic effects damp the kozai effect at high eccentricities , the presence of a stellar cusp leaves it almost unchanged until a mass threshold of a few per cent of the observed value , where eccentricity growth is stopped at very small values so that the orbit remains almost circular ( straight dotted lines ) .",
    "[ fig : kozai],width=313 ]    as a result of this analysis , we can not expect any disc star in the galactic centre to undergo a full kozai cycle , which was also shown by @xcite .",
    "however , if a star achieves high eccentricity by ( non-)resonant relaxation or close encounters @xcite , it may find itself in a point of kozai resonance where the time until maximum eccentricity is significantly shorter than the full kozai period , and also the cusp precession period is longer than for the circular case .",
    "furthermore , in our system of two disc potentials and a large reservoir of perturbing disc and cusp stars , other forms of resonance may occur ( short - term kozai / resonant relaxation with changing sources of perturbation ) .",
    "going beyond @xcite , we computed different models of two - disc systems in the presence of a stellar cusp . as a result of cusp precession",
    ", we find only @xmath0 binaries in each model achieving eccentricities high enough for binary disruption to occur ( ` 4a ` , ` 4b ` ) .",
    "when using a canonical imf down to 1 , 7 s - stars are created ( ` 4c ` ) . besides the smaller disc extent used for model ` 4c ` ( resulting in faster relaxation and shorter kozai periods ) , this is due to the number of b - stars being four times higher than in the previous cases ( and also the total mass increase ) , while the number of o - stars is still consistent with the observed value .",
    "due to the increase of total disc mass , the number of s - stars created may increase even further when using a canonical imf down to 0.01 .    for those stars achieving high eccentricities we can see the behaviour as predicted above : the eccentricity changes in a random fashion by relaxation processes until a certain value of high eccentricity is achieved . at this point",
    ", the star ( or binary ) goes into kozai resonance for a time scale long enough to achieve extreme eccentricity , but too short to be prevented by precession effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : eccevol ] shows the evolution of eccentricity as well as one component of the normalised angular momentum vector , @xmath73 , of selected stars of model ` 4b ` achieving high eccentricity . while the eccentricity evolution seems at first sight compatible with the secular instability in flat eccentric discs as discovered by @xcite , the rapid change of the stars orbital planes as indicated by @xmath73 is revealing of kozai resonance . the former secular instability can only occur in a flat ( single , non - warping and non - thickening ) , eccentric disc in a cusp with a density profile @xmath74 .",
    "component of the normalised angular momentum vector , @xmath73 ( bottom ) , of three selected stars of model ` 4b ` .",
    "the cyclic nature of eccentricity evolution as well as the rapid change of the stars orbital planes as indicated by @xmath73 are revealing of the kozai mechanism .",
    "[ fig : eccevol],width=313 ]    interestingly , we find the orbital planes eventually flipping at very high eccentricities ( e.g.  solid curve at maximum eccentricity , @xmath75myr : @xmath73 suddenly changes from @xmath76 to @xmath77 ) .",
    "this was first discovered by @xcite who applied their softened version of gauss method to the two - disc problem .",
    "however , in our case no softening is involved . at such high eccentricities , no large torque is needed to change the small angular momentum to the opposite direction ( note that this does not occur in an isolated three - body system undergoing kozai resonance ) .    in another calculation ( ` 4d ` ; using the top - heavy imf with @xmath28 ) , we used the pn terms for all disc stars from the beginning , and a spherical cusp composed of @xmath78 sbhs , which resulted in the creation of 8 b - type and 1 o - type s - star .",
    "almost all of the originating binaries had close encounters with one of the sbhs ( although not close enough to be disrupted ) , however none of these encounters lead to a sudden change in orbital eccentricity or semi - major axis which could explain the high eccentricity it achieved much later in the integration .",
    "we ascribe the higher number of s - stars created to the fact that the effectiveness of resonant relaxation is proportional to the sbh mass @xcite .",
    "apparently , pericentre shift due to relativistic effects does not prevent such high eccentricities .",
    "we conclude that if the stellar cusp in the galactic centre is mass - dominated by massive sbhs ( as predicted by @xcite and @xcite ) , at least some of the s - stars observed could have originated from the young stellar discs . in a setup of an initially eccentric disc ( as suggested by @xcite for the counter - clockwise disc ) , we can expect a somewhat higher probability of high - eccentricity orbits required for the formation of s - stars . since the age of the s - stars is less well - determined than that of the stellar discs , some of them may stem from an earlier generation of discs , which would anyway be needed to explain the longer travel times of the hyper - velocity stars observed in the milky way halo ( @xcite and references therein ) , assuming the same disruption scenario as their origin @xcite .",
    "furthermore , scattering of young binaries by massive perturbers may contribute to the observed number of s - stars @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the influence of the stellar cusp on the evolution of young stellar discs in the galactic centre .",
    "our results show that the impact of stars and stellar remnants on the disc stars orbits must not be neglected in theoretical models and numerical simulations : the stellar cusp enhances evolution of orbital eccentricities and disc thickness by ( non-)resonant relaxation of angular momentum as described by @xcite .",
    "we find that this is especially true for high eccentricities , which are prevented by a smooth cusp potential resulting in orbital precession , but are achieved in a grainy cusp as we expect to find it in the inner parsec of our galaxy .",
    "a combination of two - body relaxation processes resulting in a random increase of eccentricity and short - term kozai resonances leads to eccentricities high enough for binary disruption , leaving behind an s - star on a tight orbit and ejecting a hyper - velocity star .",
    "this process is not as efficient as it would be in the absence of a stellar cusp , but a few generations of stellar discs could account for the observed s - stars .",
    "we conclude that the creation of s - stars is a natural consequence of the interaction of two stellar discs in a grainy cusp around an smbh , where stellar orbits are exposed to the effects of general relativity .",
    "scattering of stars onto highly eccentric orbits is enhanced by a cusp composed of more massive particles , such as sbh multiples , ( remnants of ) star clusters or imbhs .",
    "thus , more realistic modelling of stellar dynamics in the galactic centre requires a better understanding of the composition of the stellar cusp .",
    "even more so , the composition of the stellar discs remains unclear .",
    "the mere existence of the s - stars may be regarded as evidence for a steeper ( i.e.  more standard - like ) imf , as this would significantly increase the number of b - stars ( and thus stars eventually reaching tight orbits ) given the observed number of o - stars .",
    "a detailed survey of b - type stars in the central parsec of the milky way will not only help us to better understand the composition of the young stellar discs and thus the formation of the s - stars , but also increase the significance of the counter - clockwise disc as well as the observed disc warping .",
    "however , if the formation of stellar discs in the galactic centre is a common scenario , most of the b - type stars ( including the known s - stars ) may stem from previous generations of discs , and their orbits are expected to be randomised by the influence of the cusp as well as the potential of current and previous discs .    as a by - product of our models",
    ", we can determine the merger rates of stellar black holes with the smbh .",
    "these mergers can be caused by an sbh plunging into the smbh , or by gradual inspiral due to gravitational wave emission ( so - called extreme mass ratio inspirals , emris ) , yielding a promising scenario for the detection of gravitational wave signals by the planned laser interferometer space antenna ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since in our models we focus on the evolution of the stellar discs , we do not differentiate between emris and plunges of sbhs , but only identify the merger of an sbh with the smbh as the point where their distance is smaller than three schwarzschild radii .",
    "our models including a cusp of 14000 sbhs of mass 15  showed merger rates from @xmath79myr@xmath80 , with a mean of 58myr@xmath80 .",
    "note that these rates may be higher when using sbhs beyond 0.22pc or of smaller masses ( and thus a higher number ) . on the other hand ,",
    "they need to be corrected for cusp depletion and loss - cone - refilling .",
    "we would like to thank pau amaro - seoane for useful comments .",
