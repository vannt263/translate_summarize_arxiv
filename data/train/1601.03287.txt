    "for example resistive field line reconnection is likely to occur at large @xmath3 as it does in resistive ballooning modes @xcite .",
    "there is also likely to be cross field transport of heat from the tube to the surrounding plasma around @xmath105 given the large gradient of temperature .",
    "this would effectively connect the high pressure region to the low pressure region via a conduit (  hosepipe \" ) along the flux tube  perhaps causing rapid loss of confinement locally .",
    "the balance of the dissipative processes will determine the longer timescale evolution of the flux tube and ultimately how it disconnects from or returns to , its original location .",
    "elms are a possible application of the ideas in this paper .",
    "however , we leave this topic to a future publication .",
    "we instead note that the explosive eruption of ballooning modes have been observed in tftr shots with internal transport barriers @xcite .",
    "a slowly evolving @xmath124 kink mode arises first and then a toroidally localized ballooning mode ( with @xmath125 ) appears .",
    "these ballooning modes eventually disrupt the plasma  a hard limit .",
    "the tubes could be destabilised from a meta - stable state at the tip of the kink mode by finite noise or by passing through linear marginal stability .",
    "we have demonstrated with the model above that flux tubes can erupt into finitely displaced states effectively connecting plasma inside the transport barrier to outside the barrier .",
    "we speculate that the ballooning mode provides a hard limit when and only when there are _ finitely _ displaced lower energy saturated states .",
