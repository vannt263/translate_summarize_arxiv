    "hypercomlex numbers are high - dimensional extensions of real numbers @xcite , and they have been introduced to solve multivariate signal processing problems , such as colour image processing @xcite , vector - sensor array signal processing @xcite , human gesture spotting @xcite , wind profile prediction @xcite , and wireless communications @xcite . in the last application ,",
    "anemometer readings are modeled with hypercomplex numbers and the wind profile is predicted by adaptive filtering algorithms . in particular , pure quaternions have been widely used to model three - dimensional ( 3d ) wind speed .",
    "when external atmospheric parameters are available , a full quaternion - valued model can be considered @xcite .",
    "the quaternion - valued model leads to improved performance over real - valued models , since it accounts for the coupling of the wind measurements and can be extended to exploiting the augmented quaternion statistics @xcite . however",
    ", pure quaternions do not form a mathematical ring @xcite , since the product of two pure quaternions is not a pure quaternion in general . as a result",
    ", the related adaptive algorithms for 3-d wind profile prediction initialised in the pure quaternion will have to work in the full quaternion domain .",
    "the prediction results have to be truncated from full quaternions to pure quaternions , implying redundant computations in the update process .",
    "for example , it takes 16 real - valued multiplications and 12 real - valued additions to implement a full - quaternion - valued multiplication . by comparison",
    ", it only takes 9 real - valued multiplications and 6 real - valued additions to calculate the multiplication of any two 3-d numbers .    in this work",
    ", we aim to develop a more compact 3-d wind speed model based on a 3-d mathematical ring called trinions , termed by an anonymous author who provided all possible definitions of 3-d numbers @xcite .",
    "we first define the gradient operation in the trinion domain and then derive the least mean squares ( lms ) adaptive algorithm , which is further extended to augmented statistics .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "a brief introduction to trinions is provided in section ii .",
    "the trinion - valued lms ( tlms ) algorithm is developed in section iii , and the augmented tlms ( atlms ) algorithm in section iv .",
    "simulation results are presented in section v and conclusions are drawn in section vi .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the 3-d wind speed is a tri - variate signal composed of three perpendicular components , and can be modeled with 3-d hypercomplex numbers ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . there are various definitions of a 3-d number @xmath0 composed of one real part ( @xmath1 ) and two imaginary parts ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 according to definitions about the relationships among the three base elements 1 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "+    to form an abelian group of these three , the following rules apply @xcite : @xmath7 trinions subject to the above rules form a commutative ring , namely , for two trinions @xmath0 and @xmath8 , we have @xmath9 .",
    "the modulus of @xmath0 is given by @xcite @xmath10 we define the following conjugate of @xmath0 , @xmath11 so that @xmath12 is equal to the real part of @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 .    to develop an lms - like algorithm in the trinion domain , the trinion - valued gradient needs to be defined . in the complex domain , a variable @xmath15 and its conjugate can be viewed as two independent variables , based on which the complex - valued gradient can be defined @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the quaternion domain , a variable @xmath16 and its three involutions can be viewed as four independent variables , based on which the quaternion - valued gradient can be derived @xcite . however , to our best knowledge , the trinion involution is not available in general . in this paper , we define the following gradients of a function @xmath17 with respect to the trinion - valued variable @xmath18 and its conjugate , @xmath19 respectively , where @xmath20 .",
    "unlike the quaternion - valued gradient , the trinion - valued gradient remains the same , no matter which side of the sub - gradients the imaginary units @xmath5 and @xmath6 are on , since trinions are commutative .",
    "we can then calculate the derivatives of some simple functions , for instance , @xmath21",
    "similar to the lms algorithm in the complex - valued domain , the trinion - valued error @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the reference signal , @xmath25 is the weight vector , @xmath26^t$ ] is the filter input , @xmath27 is the filter length , and @xmath28 is the prediction step . the cost function is expressed as @xmath29 using the steepest descent method , the following gradient need to be calculated @xmath30.\\label{gra_def}\\ ] ] for details of the calculation , please refer to appendix at the end . using results there , the update of the weight vector can be obtained as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the step size . the algorithm formulated above",
    "is termed as the trinion - valued lms ( tlms ) algorithm .",
    "a zero - mean trinion - valued vector @xmath33 is composed of three zero - mean real - valued random vectors @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , and their complete second - order statistics can be found in the following six real - valued covariance matrices : @xmath37 and they can be more efficiently represented by three trinion - valued covariance matrices : @xmath38 where superscript @xmath39 denotes the hermitian transpose and the two additional mappings of @xmath33 are defined as @xmath40 neither of these two mappings is an involution , and they are defined as shorthand notations only",
    ". then we can obtain @xmath41 to take the complete second - order statistics into consideration , we need to make use of the augmented input vector composed of the original input vector @xmath42 and its two mappings @xmath43 , namely , @xmath44 and the predicted estimate @xmath45 will be given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "analogous to the derivation of the tlms algorithm , the update equation of the augmented tlms ( atlms ) algorithm is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the step size .",
    "the computational complexity for each update of the weight vector of the trinion - based and quaternion - based filtering algorithms are summarised in table i. it can be seen that the trinion model can effectively reduce the computational complexity compared to the quaternion model .",
    ".computional complexity per update of the weight vector [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +     +     +",
    "in this section , both proposed algorithms ( tlms and atlms ) are applied to anemometer readings provided by google s re@xmath50c initiative @xcite .",
    "the wind speed measured on may 25 , 2011 is used for demonstration .",
    "the step size is set to be @xmath51 .",
    "the filter length is 8 , and the prediction step is 1 .",
    "all algorithms are initialised with zeros .",
    "the predicted results provided by tlms and atlms algorithms are shown in figs . 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "from the results , we can see that both algorithms can track the wind data effectively .",
    "the learning curves averaged over 200 trials of the proposed algorithms are shown in fig .",
    "4 , compared with the quaternion - based qlms and aqlms algorithms .",
    "it can be observed that both augmented algorithms ( aqlms and atlms ) have a faster convergence rate than the original ones ( qlms and tlms ) , due to their full exploitation of the second - order statistics .",
    "meanwhile , the proposed tlms algorithm has a similar performance with the qlms algorithm , while the atlms algorithm is comparable with the aqlms algorithm .",
    "however , as shown in table i , the proposed trinion - based algorithms have a much lower computational complexity .",
    "a compact model for three - dimensional wind profile prediction based on trinion algebra has been proposed , with two lms - type adaptive filtering algorithms derived using partial and full trinion - valued second - order statistics , respectively .",
    "numerical simulations using recorded wind data have shown that the two algorithms have a similar performance to their quaternion - valued counterparts , but with a much lower computational complexity .",
    "the cost function @xmath52 as a function of real - valued variables is given by @xmath53 where the time index ` @xmath54 ' has been dropped for the sake of compact notation .",
    "then the three component - wise gradients can be computed as @xmath55 , \\end{split } \\label{sub_gra1}\\ ] ] @xmath56 , \\end{split } \\label{sub_gra2}\\ ] ] @xmath57 .",
    "\\end{split } \\label{sub_gra3}\\ ] ] finally , we can obtain the expression for the gradient of @xmath52 by substituting ( [ sub_gra1])([sub_gra3 ] ) into ( [ gra_def ] ) , @xmath58 which yields the update equation in ( [ update ] ) , as the term @xmath59 can be absorbed into the step size .",
