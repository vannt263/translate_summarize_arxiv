    "the theoretical framework most widely used in this context is a non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism  @xcite , where coherent electron transmission according to landauer s theory is assumed .",
    "the conductance of a molecular junction can then be described in dependence on the incoming electron s energy @xmath1 in terms of the transmission probability @xmath2 , which within negf is defined as @xmath3,\\ ] ] where the self energy matrices @xmath4 and @xmath5 contain the coupling of the molecule to the left and right electrodes and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the retarded and advanced green s functions ( gf ) of the ( extended ) molecule .",

    "the usefulness of such calculations , however , still relies on simple models for interpreting them in terms of quantum chemical concepts such as atomic orbitals ( aos ) or molecular orbitals ( mos ) in order to achieve a qualitative understanding of the observed electron transport characteristics in the context of our general knowledge of the electronic properties of molecules or what is regarded as chemical intuition .    in principle",
    ", electron transmission can be viewed as a particular manifestation of the more general phenomenon of electronic communication through a molecule , where a green s function describes the propagation of a perturbation and is a measure of the connected paths made available by the bonding pattern of the molecule  @xcite .",

    "[ negf ] under the assumption that the central molecule is coupled to both metal contacts only via a single ao labeled @xmath10 and @xmath11 on the respective side , because then each matrix @xmath12 contains only one non - zero element , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively and therefore a single term remains from the trace resulting in @xmath15    by evaluating the relevant matrix elements of @xmath9 , chemical understanding of the general properties of molecules can arguably be complemented by studying their transmission properties .",
    "for example , the low - bias conductance through benzene is orders of magnitude lower when it is contacted at positions which are meta ( _ m _ ) with respect to each other when compared with ortho ( _ o _ ) or para ( _ p _ )  @xcite@xmath8@xcite .",
    "this result comes as no surprize for a chemist even without any prior exposure to the theory of molecular conductivity , who knows that the influence of a substituent in a benzene ring is `` felt '' , in both electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution reactions , in o- and p - position to it , while m - positions `` do not communicate '' .",
    "this knowledge might be referred to as chemical intuition but is actually based on rules stemming from resonance theory within the valence bond ( vb ) framework , where the relation of electronic communication to the topology of mos is not self - evident but should be contained in @xmath9 . in their classical 1947 - 1950 series of papers",
    "coulson and co - workers attempted to put the one - electron green s function ( without using the term at the time ) at the heart of chemical theory  @xcite@xmath8@xcite .",
    "they demonstrated how starting from a hckel hamiltonian in ao representation basic molecular characteristics such as mo energies , atomic charges , bond orders and response coefficients can be derived directly from the secular determinant without referring to explicit mo vectors , where the relation of this work to electron transport phenomena has been commented on very recently  @xcite@xmath8@xcite .",
    "although it was correctly claimed by datta  @xcite amongst others that in a single molecule junction the conductance is defined not only by the central molecule but rather by the entire system including the metal contacts , the individual contributions of the components are separable in eq .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of device design the molecular contribution can be optimized independently from the coupling to the metal contacts , a notion which has been recently confirmed in a joint theoretical and experimental work by manrique et al .",
    "@xcite . in this study",
    "it was shown that molecules and even their fragments contribute well defined and transferable factors to electron transport as a crucial observation for the investigation of destructive quantum interference ( dqi ) effects , a phenomenon which has been the topic of a tremendous number of recent articles , where for a rather complete bibliography we refer to ref .",

    "such dqi effects when occurring in the transmission close to the fermi energy @xmath16 can be used for data storage  @xcite , inducing thermoelectricity  @xcite or the design of logic circuits  @xcite .",
    "simple models have been proposed for their analysis , which were derived from tight - binding ( tb ) or topological hckel theory and validated by dft calculations : one of them which we refer to as `` the graphical ao scheme '' in the following has been derived specifically for the prediction of dqi and is based on a graphical analysis of the connectivity matrix of atomic orbitals ( aos )  @xcite@xmath8@xcite , while the other interprets the efficiency of transmission in a broader sense in terms of the signs and amplitudes of molecular orbitals on the atomic sites directly connected to the electrodes  @xcite@xmath8@xcite , and the analysis is sometimes limited to a `` frontier orbital approximation '' where only the highest occupied ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied mo ( lumo ) are taken into account .    the aim of this article is to reconcile the predictions from these two conceptually different approaches for an interpretation and analysis of the molecular green s function .",
    "it is expected that by focusing on either an ao or a mo representation of the same quantum - mechanical problem one should obtain the same results .",
    "their reconcilation is akin to that of the vb and mo theories in the earlier days of quantum chemistry by van vleck et al . in 1935",
    "@xcite .",
    "but while vb and mo approaches become variationally equivalent for the ground state only in the limit of full configuration interaction , for electron transport within a single particle framework the representations of the molecular green s function in the ao and mo bases are already strictly equivalent on a single determinant level . from eq .",

    "only the homo and lumo are taken into accound instead of all mos contained in @xmath9 and this approximation then limits the range of applicability of the mo based scheme to that of the coulson - rushbrooke pairing theorem  @xcite as we explain in detail in the next section .    if the contributions of all mos and not only the frontier orbitals to @xmath9 in eq .  [ trans ] are correctly accounted for on a quantitative level , however , dqi can be analyzed from a mo perspective leading to equivalent results as the graphical ao scheme from refs .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we shortly review the graphical ao scheme and highlight its relation to eq .",
    "[ trans ] .",
    "here we also explain on the basis of the pairing theorem that dqi effects entering @xmath9 can in general only be quantitatively described and understood in terms of the onsite energies of all mos and their respective amplitudes at the contacted atomic sites .",
    "furthermore , we clarify the connection of such a mo centered analysis scheme to larsson s formula , which has been originally proposed for the definition of an effective coupling from the mo contributions to the transfer integral in a marcus theory description of electron hopping  @xcite@xmath8@xcite but later on also used for the analysis of coherent electron transport in single molecule junctions  @xcite .    in the following section we provide computational studies for a variety of test systems in order to substantiate our claim that it is possible to gain understanding of dqi effects in accurate terms for any conjugated @xmath0 system without the limitations of applicability facing the original frontier mo rules .",
    "for all the molecular systems in our article numerical calculations on a dft level exist in the literature and most of them have also been studied experimentally .",
    "since the focus of our work is on topological properties of @xmath9 , for the calculations we present here topological hckel hamiltonians are used in combination with negf . in this numerical chapter",
    "we also present the respective predictions from the graphical ao scheme for all systems as a reference and demonstrate their equivalence to the results obtained from an analysis of mo contributions , where the convergence with respect to the number of mos included plays a prominent role . in the final chapter we provide a summary .",
    "the zeroth green s function @xmath9 in eq .  [ trans ] describes the propagation of a tunnelling charge between the atomic sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 mediated by all molecular orbitals ( mos ) which in the weak coupling limit can be formulated as  @xcite @xmath17^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the molecular hamiltonian , i a unity matrix and @xmath19 an infinitesimal imaginary term introduced in order to avoid divergence of @xmath9 at the eigenvalues of @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath9 is obtained from the inversion of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath18 , which is defined in an ao representation , one can analyze the properties of @xmath9 from the ratio of one of the minors of @xmath18 and its determinant  @xcite@xmath8@xcite where @xmath9 is only equal to zero when the respective minor , as defined by the connection of the leads to two particular atomic sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 on the molecule , is also zero .    in this way the graphical ao scheme for the prediction of dqi effects was derived , which has been formulated as the following set of rules : dqi occurs at @xmath20 if it is impossible to connect the two atomic sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 in a molecular topology , i.e. the only two sites with a direct coupling to the leads , by a continuous chain of paths , and at the same time fulfill the conditions ( i ) two sites can be connected by a path if they are nearest neighbors and ( ii ) at all atomic sites in the molecule other than @xmath10 and @xmath11 , there is one incoming and one outgoing path .    in other words , for a finite zero - bias conductance all aos of the molecular topology have to be either traversed within a continuous chain of paths from @xmath10 to @xmath11 or be part of a closed loop in the topology , where the latter can be a double line due to the pairing of connected orbitals or a triangle or any larger loop  @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate in the following section how to apply these rules for any given molecular topology in praxis . in a later extension of this scheme",
    "it has been clarified that such defined paths can also cancel each other out in special cases and that therefore a sign has to be attributed to them  @xcite .",
    "it has to be noted that these `` paths '' are just mathematical terms coming from forming the minor of @xmath18 and should not be interpreted as the physical path of an electron moving through the molecule .",
    "this graphical ao scheme has the advantage that it allows for the prediction of dqi without any numerical calculations being required simply by a visual assessment of the chemical structure of the central molecule in the junction .",
    "the scheme has been designed for molecules with a conjugated @xmath0 system , because it is only @xmath0 electrons which are taken into account in the topological hckel hamiltonian it was derived from . in praxis this is not really a limitation , since potential functional molecules of interest are usually conjugated systems , where @xmath0-transmission is dominant . in order to allow for a simple analytical treatment , the derivation of the scheme also originally assumed sites with identical onsite energies and couplings to each other  @xcite .",
    "this assumption was later lifted in an attempt to generalize the method now also allowing for hetero atoms in the molecular structure but this came at the price of increased mathematical complexity  @xcite .",
    "another assumption was that the only energy @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is of interest is the fermi energy because it defines the zero - bias conductance and therefore the rules only apply at @xmath20 .",
    "this latter assumption is rather delicate considering that in the model hamiltonian the graphical rules were derived from the onsite energy of carbon sites were artificially set to @xmath16 .",
    "quite surprisingly , it was found in praxis that this rather crude approximation did not seem to limit the predictive qualities of the model even for cases where hetero atoms such as oxygen were involved in the molecular structures under investigation  @xcite as long as the fermi energy defined by the metal leads lies within the homo - lumo gap of the molecule when energy levels are aligned  @xcite .      in order to gain a mo perspective of @xmath9 instead of an ao one",
    ", @xmath18 has to be looked at in its diagonalized form as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the diagonal matrix of mo eigenenergies and @xmath23 is the matrix of the coefficients for the expansion of all mos as a linear combination of all aos in the molecule . inserting this definition of @xmath18 into eq .",
    "[ zero ] gives @xmath24 which is the spectral representation of @xmath9 in a hckel ao basis with @xmath25 the coefficient of the l(r)-th ao in the m - th mo in a sum that runs over all @xmath26 occupied and unoccupied mos , which result from the coupling of the aos defining the basis vectors for @xmath18 .",
    "it should be stressed that eq .",
    "[ spectral ] is exact for any hamiltonian with an orthogonal ao basis and that this spectral representation of @xmath9 served as the starting point for the formulation of the molecular orbital rules for efficient transmission by yoshizawa and co - workers  @xcite@xmath8@xcite .",
    "for the special case of alternant hydrocarbons ( ah ) , which are molecules with a conjugated @xmath0 system where carbon atoms can be divided into two subsets , `` starred and unstarred '' , such that the atoms of one subset are bonded only to those from the other , the coulson - rushbrooke pairing theorem  @xcite applies which states that ( i ) the @xmath0 electron energy levels are symmetrically distributed about the zero energy level ( which is assumed to be @xmath16 in single molecule junctions ) and ( ii ) that each occupied mo obtained from diagonalizing the corresponding hamiltonian in an orthogonal ao basis with an energy @xmath27 has its mirror image in the unoccupied region with the energy @xmath28 , which regarding its shape differs only in the sign of all ao coefficients of one subset .    in the following we focus on molecules with an even number of mos , which we can then group in eq .",
    "[ spectral ] into pairs of the contributions from the mos whose energies are linked by the symmetry relation it defines , i.e ( h , l ) , ( h-1,l+1), ... ,(h-(n/2 - 1),(l+(n/2 - 1 ) ) with h = homo , l = lumo and @xmath29 .",
    "we can then redefine @xmath30 as the sum of these pairs , which in the following we will refer to as coulson - rushbrooke or cr pairs : @xmath31    the pairing theorem now predicts for aos @xmath10 and @xmath11 on carbon atoms of the same subset that @xmath32 because either @xmath33 and simultaneously @xmath34 , or @xmath35 and simultaneously @xmath36 , as all the coefficients in only one subset change their sign when comparing an occupied with its mirrored unoccupied level .",
    "therefore , the terms in every cr pair of eq .",
    "[ coulson ] cancel exactly at @xmath16 for this case and dqi occurs as a result as has also been observed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if on the other hand the contact aos @xmath10 and @xmath11 belong to carbon atoms from different subsets , then @xmath37 because either @xmath33 and @xmath36 , or @xmath35 and @xmath34 .",
    "for this case , the contributions coming from the two individual parts of each cr pair of mos ( h - k , l+k ) including the homo and the lumo always add up constructively at @xmath16 in eq .  [ coulson ] .",
    "although any individual cr pair contribution is therefore nonvanishing , it is important to stress that destructive interference is still possible between cr pairs , as each of them can contribute either a positive or a negative term to @xmath9 . the pairing theorem , however , does not provide the means for an assessment of prediction of such inter - pair interference .    the general conclusion from the pairing theorem is therefore that dqi will always occur for the electron transport through junctions containing alternant hydrocarbons when carbon atoms of the same subset are contacted , which is already sufficient to account for the low conductance of a variety of systems such as polyenes with contact atoms of the same parity , meta - contacted benzene or generic cross - conjugated molecules , where these cases can readily be identified from their chemical structure without any deeper analysis of the shapes and signs of their frontier mos .    on the other hand , for alternant hydrocarbons contacted on carbons belonging to different subsets ,",
    "i.e. where one contact atom is starred and the other one unstarred or for non - alternant hydrocarbons or for conjugated @xmath0 systems containing hetero atoms , the pairing theorem can neither predict nor rule out dqi . in the literature",
    "these two cases are sometimes distinguished in terms of `` easy zeros '' ( the same subset contacted ) and `` hard zeros '' ( different subsets contacted )  @xcite or linked to the occurence of an odd or even number of zeroes in @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "but for the purpose of our article the important distinction is that for even - membered alternant hydrocarbons contacted at sites of the same subset dqi will always occur , while for all other cases dqi can not be predicted without numerical calculations from a mo perspective .",
    "we note that our discussion above only refers to alternant hydrocarbons with an even number of mos and therefore also an even number of carbon sites .",
    "this is the general case for stable alternant hydrocarbons .",
    "when the total number of mos is odd , which implies the existence of a non - bonding mo at the fermi energy with non - vanishing contributions from only one subset follows from the pairing theorem , which then allows for a conduction peak instead of a dqi induced minimum at @xmath16 when the contacted atoms belong to the subset contributing to this non - bonding mo .",
    "we now turn our attention to the molecular orbital rules derived by yoshizawa and co - workers  @xcite@xmath8@xcite , where the starting point was also the spectral representation of @xmath9 given in eq .",
    "[ spectral ] .",
    "these rules are amongst the earliest formulated providing a link between the complex phenomenon of dqi in electron transmission and the standard output of quantum chemical calculations , in this case the sign of the amplitudes of mos . within a frontier orbital approximation",
    "they also become particularly simple to apply because then the entire sum in eq .",
    "[ coulson ] is dominated by only one cr pair , namely the contribution to @xmath30 coming from the homo and the lumo , and then the remaining pairs can all be neglected because their large energetic distance @xmath38 to @xmath16 results in large denominators in the respective terms , thereby making them numerically negligible .    from this assumption",
    ", it can be concluded that the transport through a single molecule would be effective , i.e. dqi would be absent , when on the two contact atoms to the two leads i ) the sign of the product of the mo expansion coefficients in the homo ( @xmath39 ) is different from that in the lumo ( @xmath40 ) and ii ) all four involved amplitudes @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are of significant magnitude .",
    "if these conditions are not fulfilled , then `` inefficient '' transmission due to at least a partial cancellation of the contributions from the homo and lumo was predicted which was not formulated as necessarily the zero transmission which is typical for dqi in a rigid sense .",
    "such a frontier orbital approximation , however , only delivers correct results for the prediction of dqi whre the cr pairing theorem  @xcite is applicable . if the atoms contacted by the two electrodes belong to the same subset ( either starred or unstarred ) of carbon atoms in an even - membered ah , the cancellation of the contributions from the homo and the lumo to @xmath30 is a reliable indicator of dqi not necessarily because they are dominant , but because it represents the cancellation of also the contributions within all other cr pairs entering eq .",
    "[ coulson ] .",
    "this is the reason why dqi can be understood in this case in terms of the frontier orbitals alone .",
    "for all other cases all mos in the system need to be considered . if an alternant hydrocarbon is contacted at atomic sites belonging to different subsets , i.e one being starred and one being unstarred according to the cr framework , then although contributions from the homo and lumo can only interfere constructively the tails related to lower lying occupied and higher lying unoccupied mos might still cancel out with those of the frontier orbitals at @xmath16 and cause dqi . for non - alternant hydrocarbons and organic molecules containing hetero atoms , it turns out to be equally insufficient to limit the analysis to just one or even two cr pairs of mo contributions . in the next section",
    "we will provide a range of numerical examples justifying this assertion .",
    "a somewhat simplified form of eq .  [ spectral ] has been known for decades as larsson s formula in a different but related context , where it was used for the definition of the transfer integral mediated by a selected set of mos in a marcus theory description of electron hopping  @xcite@xmath8@xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been realized  @xcite that the same formula can be also employed to define an approximation for @xmath2 in coherent eletron tunnelling as @xmath45 with @xmath46 being an energy dependent effective coupling containing the contributions from all mos of a molecular bridge and defined by @xmath47    here @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the eigenenergy , and the respective couplings to the left and right contact of the @xmath51th mo and @xmath1 is the kinetic energy of a transferred electron .",
    "it is easy to see by direct comparison that the effective coupling @xmath46 in eq .",
    "[ gamma ] is very much related to the zeroth green s function in eq .",
    "[ spectral ] .",
    "there are only two differences between the two equations .",
    "first , the mo amplitudes @xmath25 have been replaced by couplings @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which describe the overlap of each mo with a respective contact ao on the two leads . since in the negf - tb description",
    "we employ for our numerical studies in the following section the contact ao on the leads is always the same orbital , this difference amounts to just the same constant factor for all the mo terms of the sum in eq .",
    "[ gamma ] and is therefore irrelevant for our study where we just set this value to 1 .",
    "the second difference between the two expressions , namely the dropping of the infinitesimal term @xmath19 just means that @xmath46 diverges at the eigenergies of all mos . in principle",
    "this deficiency can be repaired by introducing an energy dependent normalisation factor as has been derived from the more general theory in ref .",
    "@xcite by sautet et al .",
    "@xcite under the very limiting condition of @xmath52 , which is relevant when the focus is on the analysis of stm measurements . since the qualitative behaviour of @xmath53 does not deviate from that of @xmath2 obtained from negf - tb in all systems investigated in this article , we avoide such a normalisation factor as an unnecessary complication . in the following section",
    "we just truncate @xmath53 as obtained from eq .",

    "can be directly concluded from the cr pairing theorem by using eq .",
    "[ coulson ] .",
    "for all other cases , neither the pairing theorem applies nor can reliable predictions on dqi be obtained within a frontier orbital approximation , because the occurrence or absence of dqi for any given value of @xmath1 seems to depend on a fine balance of cumulative contributions with different signs from all mos , where a quantitative description of the decay of their respective tails is crucial as we will demonstrate in the next section .",
    "all the case studies in this article are based on simple models both in ao and mo representations as derived from the topological properties of the molecular hamiltonian @xmath18 in a tight binding approximation with all onsite energies for the carbon aos contributing to the @xmath0 system set to zero , i.e. to the origin of energy assumed to represent @xmath16 , and the couplings between them to the resonance integral @xmath55 from hckel theory which also defines the unit of the energy axis .    as an appropriate numerical benchmark for our conclusions we therefore present negf - tb calculations which have been conducted within the atomic simulation environment ( ase )  @xcite with a coupling of @xmath55 between the molecular topology and the semi infinite carbon chains used for the electrodes .",

    "this claim has later been refuted  @xcite , where it was shown that the predictions of the graphical ao scheme were also correct for azulene with @xmath58,@xmath57-contacts when closed loops of aos and not only pairs of them are considered which always has been a central aspect of the scheme  @xcite .",

    "[ fig3]a ) and zero conductance found only for the open form of dne ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) , a result which needs the inclusion of all mos and not just the frontier orbitals  @xcite as we will further argue below .    also for dte ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]c ) only the open form exhibits a transmission zero at @xmath16 for the analog alternant hydrocarbons ( right two panels ) , which is shifted to higher energies if the s atoms are included in the calculations ( left two panels ) but still lowers the conductance at the fermi energy in its vicinity quite substantially even then .    for azulene ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]d ) there are qi minima across the energy spectrum for the two investigated junctions which differ in their respective contact sites .",
    "but while contacts in the @xmath59,@xmath60-positions ( red lines ) result in zero conductance , the minima for the @xmath58,@xmath57-connected system are not only lying above @xmath16 but are also so narrow that they do not seem to have an impact on @xmath62 .",
    "we note that all these features we summarized here are in good qualitative agreement with the respective negf - dft calculations in the literature we referred to in the last section when introducing the respective molecular structures above .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we demonstrate the application of the graphical ao scheme  @xcite for all systems in fig .  [ fig2 ] without hetero atoms and its predictions for dqi identify the cases with @xmath63 in the calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] without a single failure , regardless of whether the molecular topology belongs to an alternant or non - alternant hydrocarbon or which subset of carbon atoms in relation to the `` starring '' scheme the electrodes are connected to .    in principle",
    ", it would also be possible to account for the presence of hetero atoms within the scheme as it has been done elsewhere  @xcite for a treatment of dte containing its sulfur sites but this would come at the price of diminishing the scheme s simplicity and would not provide any important arguments for the present discussion .",
    "this ao scheme considers all orbitals in an ao representation and relies on the structure of the entire hamiltonian thereby strongly reflecting the respective molecular topology .",
    "this is in contrast to any frontier orbital approximation within a mo based scheme where by definition all but two mos are disregarded .",
    "the pairing theorem justifies this omission for the specific case , where each cr pair defined by the respective equal distance of its parts to @xmath16 cancels out individually for symmetry reasons . for the other cases where interference is constructive within each pair dqi can still occur due to cancellation between pairs",
    "this is why all mo contributions are significant in this latter case as we will further explore below .          independently of the frontier orbital approximation",
    "as we discuss it in this article , there is the common conception in studies of the conductance of single molecule junctions that @xmath62 is dominated by the mos close to @xmath16 since the tails of the peaks further apart decay rapidly and their contributions can therefore safely be disregarded  @xcite .",
    "this assumption is also motivated by the fact that the respective distance of each mo to the fermi energy enters its respective term in eqns .",
    "[ spectral ] and  [ gamma ] explicitly in the denominator and its increase can therefore be expected to reduce the terms significance .",
    "there are two reasons why such preconceptions should be questioned regarding their validity in general : i ) while it is true that the denominator of a term in eqns .",
    "[ spectral ] and  [ gamma ] increases for high values of @xmath64 , this effect might be outweighed by large couplings or large mo amplitudes at the contact sites ; ii ) the distinction between the occurrence and absence of dqi is often one between an exact value of zero ( at least in the framework of tb where only @xmath0 electrons are considered ) and a rather small number which appears to be bigger than it actually is due to the logarithmic plotting of @xmath2 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we increase the number of cr pairs of mos included in the sum of eq .",
    "[ gamma ] for the calculation of @xmath53 stepwise for the systems in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] which exhibit dqi close to the fermi level but where this can not be predicted within a frontier orbital approximation . here we first consider only the homo and the lumo ( label @xmath58 ) , then the homo , the lumo , the homo-1 and the lumo+1 ( label @xmath56 ) and",
    "so on where only the red curve with the highest label includes the contributions from all cr pairs of mos corresponding to the respective molecular topology .",
    "quite contrarily to what might be expected , for the open forms of dne ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) and dte ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]b and c ) the convergence of @xmath53 with the number of included pairs is not smooth but oscillating because the contributions of cr pairs of mos enter with alternating signs . even for the label with only the cr pair with the energies most remote from @xmath16 missing , i.e. the labels @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath59 for dne , dte without and with s , respectively",
    ", the conductance is still far from zero on a logarithmic scale . for the label @xmath57 with the three cr pairs of mos closest to the fermi energy",
    "included it even has a magnitude comparable to that of the conducting closed form of the respective switch , where for dte the convergence behavior seems to be rather unaffected by the presence or absence of the s atoms .",
    "this analysis strongly indicates that in order to capture dqi effects for a particular molecular topology correctly really all mos belonging to its @xmath0 system need to be properly accounted for in order to achieve a reliable theoretical description .",
    "even for the non - alternant hydrocarbon azulene contacted in ( @xmath59,@xmath60- ) positions ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]d ) , where no destructive but also no constructive interference within each pair can be indicated directly from the pairing theorem , the contributions from the frontier orbitals , i.e. the homo and lumo , alone ( label @xmath58 ) do not result in any dqi feature close to @xmath16 .",
    "the inclusion of the second cr pair of mos ( label @xmath56 ) produces this feature but it then again needs the contributions from all cr pairs to position it energetically exactly at @xmath16 .    , where @xmath46 is taken as the sum over all five occupied ( blue curve ) or only the three occupied mos closest to @xmath16 ( magenta curve ) in eq .",
    "[ gamma ] for the open form of the ah analog of dte with the s atoms removed . ]",
    "another property that arises from the pairing theorem is that in the case of dqi for even - membered ahs connected at sites belonging to different subsets , the contributions from all occupied and all unoccupied mos to @xmath46 in eq .",
    "[ gamma ] must each cancel out individually at @xmath16 .",
    "this is because in those cases the contribution from each half of a cr pair is equal to the other half in both sign and magnitude at @xmath16 , which means that it is then sufficient to consider either all occupied or all unoccupied mos alone .    making use of this knowledge , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we plot @xmath53 from the sum over the occupied states in eqn .",
    "[ gamma ] , where we compare taking all five occupied mos for the open form of the ah analog of dte with the s atoms removed ( blue curve ) with the case where the lowest lying two mos have been excluded from the summation ( magenta curve ) .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , cutting out the lowest lying two mos does not make any difference in the energy regions of the peaks of the three higher lying mos , because the transmission in the vicinity of a peak is always largely dominated by the contribution of the one mo it is related to , but crucially decides whether dqi occurs at the fermi level or not .",
    "this enforces the main message of our article that in order to identify dqi reliably from a mo perspective the contribution of all mos need to be taken into account and not just a selected few of them .",
    "this finding has also high importance for the analysis of negf - dft results , where a cut coupling approach is routinely used to describe dqi in terms of a few mos close to @xmath16 only  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we showed that dqi in the electron transport of single molecule junctions can be reliably discussed from a mo perspective if the contributions from all mos are accounted for and not only those from mos close to the fermi level .",
    "this applies in general and not only for even - membered alternant hydrocarbons contacted at carbon sites of the same subset as it is the case for predictions within a frontier orbital approximation .    this mo perspective",
    ", however , does not in general allow for the prediction of dqi without prior numerical calculations within a tb framework which puts it into contrast to a recently proposed graphical ao scheme  @xcite where such predictions are indeed possible .",
    "on the other hand such a mo based analysis is not limited to the prediction of the zero - bias conductance defined by the transmission at the fermi level and can thus provide essential input for the interpretation of computationally more demanding negf - dft results as well as reconcile findings from single molecule electronics with more traditional concepts from quantum chemistry .",
