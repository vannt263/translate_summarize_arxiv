    "<S> as the constituents of a flock are polar , one expects a fore - aft asymmetry in their interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we show here that the resulting antisymmetric part of the `` exchange coupling '' between a bird and its neighbours , if large enough , destabilizes the flock through spontaneous turning of the birds . </S>",
    "<S> the same asymmetry also yields a natural mechanism for a difference between the speed of advection of information along the flock and the speed of the flock itself . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the absence of detailed balance , and not merely the breaking of galilean invariance , is responsible for this difference . </S>",
    "<S> we delineate the conditions on parameters and wavenumber for the existence of the turning instability . </S>",
    "<S> lastly we present an alternative perspective based on flow - alignment effects in an active liquid crystal with turning inertia in contact with a momentum sink .    in the classic models of flocking @xcite and much of the later literature @xcite each agent ( hereafter termed a bird ) </S>",
    "<S> is assumed to adjust its direction of motion instantaneously to the mean of its neighbours including itself , plus a random error . </S>",
    "<S> it has recently become clear @xcite that , on time- and length - scales relevant to observations on real bird flocks , the dynamics of this reorientation must be explicitly taken into account , via an explicit classical spin angular momentum on which the aligning interaction acts as a torque . </S>",
    "<S> this inertial effect was shown @xcite to give rise , on intermediate length scales @xcite , to turning waves reminiscent of those predicted for inertial flocks in fluids @xcite or rotor lattices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the longest scales , where damping by the ambient medium overcomes inertia , the dynamics is effectively described by the toner - tu @xcite equations .    </S>",
    "<S> however , in @xcite the aligning field was implicitly taken to arise from an effective hamiltonian , so the interactions were perfectly mutual . </S>",
    "<S> a pair of birds exerted opposing torques of equal magnitude on each other , conserving spin angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this is in principle unduly restrictive : terms not governed by an energy function are permitted in systems out of thermal equilibrium , and the dynamics takes place in contact with an ambient medium with which the birds can exchange both angular and linear momentum . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , self - propulsion consists precisely in drawing linear momentum from the ambient medium , with directional bias determined by the structural polarity of the bird . despite the possibility of drawing _ </S>",
    "<S> angular _ momentum from the ambient air , self - propelling activity will not lead to a net persistent rotational motion as a bird can reasonably be considered achiral on average . in the flocking models we consider , </S>",
    "<S> birds are individually achiral and carry only a position and a vectorial orientation . </S>",
    "<S> transient chirality and , hence , spontaneous rotation can arise only in the relative arrangements of two or more birds . </S>",
    "<S> consider a pair of birds flying one ahead of the other . </S>",
    "<S> the basic assumption of flocking models is that if the velocity vectors of the birds depart slightly from being parallel , an aligning torque arises . </S>",
    "<S> each bird tries to rotate its flying orientation to match that of its neighbour , but one expects in general that the aligning response of the leading bird to the trailing bird should be different from that of the trailer to the leader ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chiral_rotate ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> such antisymmetry of information transfer or response could arise , inter alia , from vision @xcite or airflow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our focus is distinct from that of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in which pairwise antisymmetry , distributed statistically across a collection of birds , gives rise to an ultra - rapid response and relaxation . in both works , however , motility and antisymmetric aligning torques enter as two distinct manifestations of the nonequilibrium nature of the system .        here </S>",
    "<S> we study the consequence of this physically natural asymmetry of interaction , within the hydrodynamic description @xcite of flocks with turning inertia @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between birds flying precisely side - by - side is taken to be symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> our main results are : ( i ) if the antisymmetric part @xmath0 of the aligning interaction between fore - aft separated birds exceeds a threshold @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the symmetric part , uniform flocks undergo a spontaneous buckling instability with wavevector @xmath3 along the mean direction of alignment of the flock , which we denote @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) a crossover lengthscale @xmath5 separates the dynamics into two regimes . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath6 the instability growth rate is diffusive , @xmath7 , crossing over to @xmath8 for @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) for @xmath10 , where the flock is stable , the small-@xmath11 dynamics is of the toner - tu type , with the coefficient of the advective term shifted by a contribution proportional to @xmath0 . at large @xmath11 the turning waves of refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are recovered . </S>",
    "<S> antisymmetric exchange thus plays a dual role , providing a natural mechanism for a difference between the information - transfer speed and the flock speed _ and _ , if large enough , destabilizing the flock . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we show that antisymmetric exchange emerges from the classic flow - alignment term @xcite if motility is introduced into polar liquid crystal hydrodynamics @xcite , with rotational inertia and without momentum conservation .    before showing how we arrived at these results , </S>",
    "<S> a remark is in order regarding advective effects in flocking models . in the toner - tu @xcite equation </S>",
    "<S> the velocity field does not advect itself at the same rate as it advects the density . while it is tempting to attribute this asymmetry simply to the absence of galilean invariance in the theory , both galilean invariance and detailed balance have to be absent for this effect to emerge @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , when constructing toner - tu hydrodynamics from inertial spin hydrodynamics @xcite this difference in advection velocities has to be put in by hand . as we shall see below , the simplest microscopic form of the inertial spin model ( ism ) @xcite leads to equal coefficients for advection in the toner - tu density and velocity equations . </S>",
    "<S> our result ( iii ) above thus clarifies that an antisymmetric exchange coupling in the ism is essential in order for the advective term in the resultant toner - tu equation to have a coefficient different from unity . with this remark in hand </S>",
    "<S> we turn to showing how we obtained our results .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a flock in the @xmath12 plane . </S>",
    "<S> let the @xmath13th bird have velocity @xmath14 with fixed magnitude @xmath15 and classical `` spin '' angular momentum @xmath16 , about its centre of mass , along @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> let us describe the aligning interaction of neighbouring birds as a torque [ torque ] _ </S>",
    "<S> = _ j _ _ _ due to birds @xmath18 neighbouring @xmath13 , which rotates the direction of the velocities : [ rotation ] _ = * s * _ _ , where @xmath19 is a rotational inertia @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as remarked above we must allow for processes that do not conserve angular momentum @xcite . specifically </S>",
    "<S> , we must allow for the possibility that the coupling @xmath20 is non - symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> the result is that the rate at which bird @xmath13 turns to align with @xmath18 differs from that at which @xmath18 turns to align with @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> such `` antisymmetric exchange '' @xcite violates angular momentum conservation while preserving rotation invariance , because the aligning field does not arise from an energy function @xcite , and is under no obligation to do so . making the physically reasonable approximation that the interactions of birds are left - right symmetric , we see that @xmath20 should have an antisymmetric part when birds @xmath13 and @xmath18 are one behind the other  possibly through polar asymmetries of airflow or vision  and not when they are side - by - side . of course </S>",
    "<S> , even the symmetric part of @xmath20 should in general be anisotropic and should thus differ for longitudinal and lateral neighbours . </S>",
    "<S> however , this latter asymmetry is not of much consequence for the issues considered here ; at least within a linearized theory it can be removed by anisotropic rescaling of coordinates .    for a one - dimensional chain of birds oriented in the direction of mean motion , we therefore allow for nearest neighbour couplings @xcite @xmath21 leading via the torque ( [ torque ] ) to the equation of motion @xmath22 where @xmath23 is friction with the ambient medium . going beyond a one - dimensional array with fixed neighbour assignments , fore - aft asymmetry must be defined with respect to the orientation ( and hence velocity ) vector of a bird . </S>",
    "<S> let us pass from a lagrangian picture tied to individual birds to a continuum eulerian description referred to points in space , with number density @xmath24 , velocity @xmath25 and spin angular momentum density @xmath26 fields as functions of position @xmath27 and time @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> introducing a potential [ landaupotl ] u = d^drfavouring a local speed @xmath29 , and a pressure @xmath30 , we obtain the hydrodynamic equations @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the material derivative , without the possibility at this stage of an arbitrary advection coefficient , and the antisymmetric coupling @xmath0 acts between fore - aft neighbours as defined _ locally _ by @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in replacing the differences in ( [ particleeq ] ) by the spatial derivatives in ( [ spinpde ] ) we have implicitly introduced a mean interbird spacing @xmath36 , in terms of which @xmath37 and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath39 thus has units of length . </S>",
    "<S> equations ( [ velpde ] ) and ( [ conteq ] ) are as in the original inertial spin model @xcite , but ( [ spinpde ] ) has the new term @xmath40 from the antisymmetric exchange coupling , where @xmath41 eq . tells us that @xmath42 is a fast variable , relaxing on non - hydrodynamic timescales to a value determined by @xmath43 and @xmath44 . implementing this prescription _ to leading order in _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 , one can solve by disregarding the time derivative and insert the resulting value for @xmath42 in ( [ velpde ] ) , yielding @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the projector transverse to @xmath35 , and the continuity equation ( [ conteq ] ) as before . </S>",
    "<S> we thus recover the toner - tu @xcite equations apart from innocuous projectors transverse to @xmath35 which arise because of the length - preserving nature of the torque ( [ torque ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the antisymmetry parameter @xmath0 provides a natural mechanism for a coefficient different from unity for the advection term in , a key feature of the toner - tu @xcite formulation . </S>",
    "<S> however , losing galilean invariance alone can not generate such a term : the absence of detailed balance , as signalled by @xmath0 , is crucial @xcite . in an _ equilibrium _ fluid moving in contact with a momentum sink the coefficients in the momentum and </S>",
    "<S> density equations must agree . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath0 leads to a fore - aft asymmetry in the local transfer of orientational information . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore natural that it should give rise to a disturbance speed different from the flock speed .    </S>",
    "<S> we will see below that the above leading - order treatment is a little misleading , as it fails to capture some important physics at order @xmath48 in ( [ tonertulimit ] ) . to this end </S>",
    "<S> let us study the coupled dynamics of ( [ velpde ] ) - ( [ conteq ] ) in more detail , linearizing about an ordered steadily moving state : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 . defining @xmath52 and directions @xmath53 and @xmath54 along and transverse to @xmath55 and working in a frame moving with same velocity as the mean velocity of flock we get @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 the coupling of orientation to spin angular momentum through @xmath0 enters only the modes with @xmath59 , while orientation and density couple through splay ( @xmath60 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these modes can thus be separated by looking at @xmath3 along or transverse to @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the general characteristic equation relating frequency @xmath61 to wavevector @xmath62 reads @xmath63 to highlight the physics of antisymmetric exchange we look at modes with @xmath64 , for which @xmath65 which yields mode frequencies @xmath66 the lower sign corresponds to the fast decay of @xmath67 , at a rate @xmath68 in the limit of zero wavenumber . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 nonetheless affects the dynamics of @xmath69 at nonzero wavenumber . for small @xmath70 , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , in the toner - tu regime , the eigenfrequencies are @xmath71 so that the correct toner - tu limit is one in which @xmath2 in ( [ tonertulimit ] ) is replaced by @xmath72 . for large @xmath70 , </S>",
    "<S> that is , in the turning - wave regime , the modes cross over to [ largek ] k _ - i 2 ( ) . in either limit and for all wavenumbers in between we see that the uniformly moving flock suffers a buckling instability for @xmath73 larger than a threshold @xmath74 the instability is diffusive for small @xmath70 and wavenumber - independent for large @xmath70 . for @xmath75 , which corresponds to the case where a bird responds more to the bird ahead of it than to the bird behind , </S>",
    "<S> we see from ( [ smallk ] ) and ( [ largek ] ) that the unstable disturbance travels towards the rear of the flock , which is physically reasonable . the propagation speed , though , is different in the two regimes . at small @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> it is set by the kinematic - wave speed along the flock , determined by @xmath0 while at large @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> the relevant speed @xmath76 is that of the turning waves , as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is readily seen that the crossover between the growth rates in ( [ smallk ] ) and ( [ largek ] ) takes place at @xmath77 where [ xidef ] ^2 = j ^2 ( 1 + ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus derived the results ( i ) - ( iii ) advertised at the beginning of this work . </S>",
    "<S> we note in passing that the effect of the antisymmetric exchange @xmath0 can be made especially prominent by considering wavenumbers [ kcondition ] k _ , for which simplifies to @xmath78 i.e. , the crossover from diffusive to saturated is through a @xmath79 dependence over a regime whose width grows with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition ( [ kcondition ] ) on wavenumber can of course obtain only if @xmath80 as defined in .    to go beyond this linear stability analysis we study equations ( [ torque ] ) and ( [ rotation ] ) numerically in the presence of spin - damping @xmath81 because of the ambient medium . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict our attention to one - dimensional strands of birds , with initial velocities ( i.e. , orientation vectors ) globally aligned either ( a ) along or ( b ) perpendicular to the strand , plus a perturbation . for ( b ) </S>",
    "<S> we consider cases where the perturbation in @xmath82 is zero . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with the linear stability analysis , we find unstable growth of small perturbations when @xmath0 is large enough in case ( a ) ; see @xcite , video 1 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , even the linearly stable case ( b ) displays a nonlinear instability at large @xmath0 when the initial perturbation in @xmath83 is large enough ; see @xcite , video 2 .    </S>",
    "<S> we further note that the instability of the longitudinal diffusivity is governed by the same term that produces the nonlinearity responsible for stabilising long - range order in two - dimensions in the toner - tu theory . </S>",
    "<S> thus , increasing @xmath0 _ ceteris paribus _ always destabilizes the flock . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , it is perfectly possible to have stable flocks at arbitrarily large @xmath0 and , thus , arbitrarily high speed of disturbance propagation in the frame of the flock , provided the diffusivity is kept positive by increasing @xmath2 as well .    </S>",
    "<S> we turn to result ( iv ) promised at the start of this article . in the discussion </S>",
    "<S> so far , motility ( the fact that the polar order parameter @xmath35 is a velocity ) and antisymmetric exchange [ the @xmath84 term in the spin equations ] entered as independent nonequilibrium effects . </S>",
    "<S> we now show , within polar liquid crystal hydrodynamics @xcite , modified to include rotational inertia and a momentum sink , that motility leads to antisymmetric exchange . </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the coupled hydrodynamic equations for _ distinct _ velocity and orientation fields @xmath85 and @xmath43 and spin angular momentum density field @xmath42 , together with continuity @xmath86 for the density field @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the process we introduce several phenomenological parameters whose meaning is clear from context . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the molecular field conjugate to @xmath43 , @xmath90/2 $ ] is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 where @xmath93 in ( [ vpde ] ) denotes damping by a substrate and the ellipsis denotes pressure and viscous terms . note that and are exactly the equations that one would have obtained for a uniaxial liquid crystal on a substrate . </S>",
    "<S> that the system is intrinsically nonequilibrium enters only at one point : the forcing @xmath94 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ vpde ] ) for the velocity and the polarisation . on long time and length scales ( [ vpde ] ) reduces to @xmath95 , allowing us to eliminate @xmath85 in favour of @xmath43 in ( [ ppde ] ) and ( [ spde ] ) , the final term in turns into the term that was argued to arise because of antisymmetric exchange , with @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , and turn into and upon rescaling @xmath97 , with @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> we refer the interested readers to @xcite for an explicit expression of the dynamical equation ( including terms at next order in gradients ) that is obtained by this method . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath99 term describes liquid crystal flow alignment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus ( see @xcite for a brief discussion ) , flow alignment together with an active velocity in the direction of polarisation leads to a non - unit coefficient for the advective non - linearity . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that even if a flock does not have microscopic antisymmetric interactions , an effective antisymmetric exchange is always generated dynamically . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the theory developed in this paper remains valid even if there is no intrinsic asymmetry in the interactions between two birds .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> : asymmetric exchange ca nt be ruled out and should therefore be part of the consideration in any modelling of flocks . </S>",
    "<S> if observations rule it out , it is presumably because it was selected against by evolution . </S>",
    "<S> if this term is large enough it changes qualitatively the dynamics in the `` turning inertia '' regime , giving rise to a spontaneous turning of the flock in either direction at intermediate length scales and to an ultimate disruption of the flock . at </S>",
    "<S> long length scales it gives a natural mechanism for the advective term to have a coefficient different from unity . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that this term , although rotation - invariant , is not angular - momentum - conserving and therefore can arise only if the birds are in contact with an ambient medium . </S>",
    "<S> the antisymmetry @xmath0 and the air - damping @xmath23 are not entirely independent , so it remains to be seen how easy it is for the condition @xmath100 to be met .    </S>",
