    "these mid - gap modes represent the excitation energies required as the occupation number of the four topological edge modes ( two for each orbital ) increases sequentially from zero to four .",

    "<S> _ phase diagram and the trivial states_. based on our understanding of the interaction - induced topological phase transition , we map out the phase diagram in fig .  [ fig : phasediag ] . while the phase boundaries are determined from entanglement - spectrum and entropy calculations , we further identify different trivial states such as the rung - singlet states , the charge - density wave ( cdw ) state , and the orbital - density wave ( odw ) state by calculating their corresponding local quantities  @xcite . as we have discussed previously , when @xmath51 , the ground state of the system can undergo a topological phase transition from a topological ( t ) phase to a trivial symmetric state . </S>",
    "<S> we define the singlet states in the orbital- ( spin- ) degrees of freedom as @xmath73 , and analyze the local quantity @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the local density operator for the corresponding singlet states . as indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phasediag](b ) , the trivial symmetric state for the repulsive @xmath40 case ( with @xmath51 ) is essentially a spin rung - singlet ( srs ) state in a ladder system  @xcite , which can be described by the direct - product state @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath38 becomes finite , the system can become the obital rung - singlet ( ors ) state ( @xmath77 ) , the cdw , or an odw state beyond the topological phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> both the cdw and odw are ordered trivial states with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry , which can be confirmed by calculating the corresponding local quantities as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phasediag](c)(d ) . in general , the phase diagrams are consistent with the understanding that the topology should be robust against weak symmetry - preserving interactions , while larger interactions would induce a topological phase transition , beyond which the system becomes trivial . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the t state seems to persist in the large attractive @xmath40 limit , as long as @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the overall topologies of the phase diagram are similar at finite zeeman fields @xmath78 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ topological edge modes_. when the system is in the t state , topological edge modes should emerge at the boundaries , which significantly affect the ground - state degeneracy at half filling . from numerical studies , we find that the ground - state degeneracy is dependent on the bulk interactions . at half filling , half of the four spin - polarized fermionic edge modes ( two for each edge ) should be occupied . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state in the absence of interactions should then be six - fold . </S>",
    "<S> however , the degeneracy of the ground state would change under finite interactions , leading to the splitting of the edge modes as well as the shifting of their energies . </S>",
    "<S> the ground - state degeneracy as well as the spt classification can be clarified by invoking the projective representation of the relevant symmetry group  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for repulsive bulk interactions @xmath55 , the ground state at half filling are four - fold degenerate , with only one edge mode occupied on each edge . for attractive bulk interactions @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> , the ground state at half filling are two - fold degenerate , with the two edge modes at each edge either both empty or both occupied . </S>",
    "<S> this understanding of the topological edge modes not only provides a way to manipulate the edge modes by tuning the bulk interactions , but also offers a detection scheme of the spt state based on the topological edge modes  @xcite .    _ detection_. the interaction - induced topological phase transition can be probed by measuring the local density distributions of the topological edge modes . </S>",
    "<S> the density distribution of the edge modes can be calculated as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the expectation value of the density operator @xmath81 under the bulk ground - state wave function for @xmath82 atoms . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : edge ] , while the trivial srs state features a non - local density distribution with negligible population at the edges , t states with two- and four - fold ground - state degeneracies feature localized density distributions at the edges . in particular , for t states with two - fold ground - state degeneracy , the localized edge - mode density distribution is twice as much as the state with four - fold degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that other trivial states have similarly negligible population at the edges as the srs . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the local density distribution of the edge modes not only allows for the detection of the interaction - induced topological phase transition , but also enables the determination of the edge - mode degeneracy in the t state . to measure the local atomic density distribution at the edges , one needs to measure the overall occupation of the @xmath2 and the @xmath4 orbitals at the boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> measurement of populations of the @xmath2 and @xmath4 orbitals can be achieved , respectively , by coupling the @xmath1-@xmath83 and the @xmath3-@xmath83 ( or the @xmath3-@xmath84-@xmath83 two - photon ) transitions , and recording the resulting fluorescence . to selectively apply local operations at the edges , a localized laser field can be applied at the edges to provide the necessary energy shifts . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that the topological phase transition may also be detected by probing the non - local string - order parameters  @xcite , which can be achieved by measuring single - site - resolved on - site parity of the atom number  @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> final remarks_. we have shown that spt for interacting fermions can be realized and probed in alkaline - earth - like atomic gases . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is facilitated by the separation of orbital and nuclear - spin degrees of freedom in the clock - state manifolds , and by the inter - orbital nuclear - spin - exchange interactions inherent in the system . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative scheme with separate raman lasers for different orbitals can also be considered , in which case the reflection symmetry between the two orbitals would be broken even at a zero external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> however , the non - trivial spt should survive , as it is not protected by the inter - orbital reflection symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> our results open up the avenue for simulating spt states for interacting fermions , and for studying spt classifications using cold atoms .    _ </S>",
