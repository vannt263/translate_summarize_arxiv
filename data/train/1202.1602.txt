    "blazars are the most extreme class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are characterized by two distinct bumps : the first bump located at low - energy band is dominated by the synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons which originates in a relativistic jet , and the second bump located at high - energy band could be produced by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering ( e.g. , bttcher 2007 ) .",
    "various soft photon sources seed the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process ( e.g. , rees 1967 ; maraschi et al . 1992 ) and external compton ( ec ) process ( e.g. , dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ; sikora et al .",
    "1994 ) in the jet to produce @xmath0-rays .",
    "it should be noted that hadronic models have also been proposed to explain the multi - band emissions of blazars ( e.g. , mannheim 1993 ; mcke et al .",
    "2003 ) . at present",
    ", the detectors including the ground - based and satellite - based ones can provide us the high quality data to construct seds .",
    "therefore , the simultaneous and quasi - simultaneous seds become the basic tools to study the physics properties of blazars , such as magnetic field , the size of emission region , doppler factor and so on .    the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard the _ fermi _ satellite provides unprecedented sensitivity in the @xmath0-ray band . in its two years operations ,",
    "987 blazars were detected , including 360 flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , 423 bl lacs and 204 unknown type blazars @xcite . with _",
    "fermi _ , _ swift _ and other observatories , @xcite assembled high quality data of 48 blazars in the first three months lat sample ( lat bright agn sample : lbas ) to build quasi - simultaneous seds .",
    "the data from _ swift _ were collected in one day or several days , however , the _",
    "fermi_-lat data have been averaged over a three months period .",
    "therefore , the multi - frequency data are quasi - simultaneous but not really simultaneous .",
    "very recently , @xcite built the seds for 105 blazars with the simultaneous _ planck _ , _ swift _ , _ fermi _ , and ground - based data .",
    "the data of the 105 blazars are obtained between 2009 dec . and 2010 oct . , which were all collected in one day or several days , and the multi - frequency data are really simultaneous .",
    "since the _ fermi _ data are publicly available , many authors have studied the physical properties of blazars with multi - frequency data from radio - x - ray to @xmath0-ray bands .",
    "@xcite constructed the seds for 85 blazars in lbas , and found that there is a positive correlation between the jet power and the luminosity of the accretion disk in fsrqs .",
    "later , @xcite also analyzed the physical properties of blazars with high redshifts in the 11 months _ fermi _ agn sample ( the first lat agn catalog : 1lac ) by using the multi - frequency data .",
    "however , most of the multi - frequency data used by these authors are not simultaneous or quasi - simultaneous .    in the study of @xmath0-ray emissions of blazars ,",
    "one of important physical properties is the locations of the @xmath0-ray emission regions .",
    "many authors studied the locations of emission regions in different ways .",
    "for example , observed time lag of the @xmath0-ray emission relative to broad emission lines for 3c 273 is used to constrain the @xmath0-ray emission region @xcite , the @xmath0-ray absorptions by internal photons of agns can be used to constrain the locations of the @xmath0-ray emission regions @xcite , and the @xmath0-ray flux variability of a blazar can infer its location of @xmath0-ray emission @xcite . in this paper , we study the locations of the emission regions of 21 blazars whose simultaneous and quasi - simultaneous multi - frequency seds have been given by @xcite and @xcite in the frame of the multi - component model described in @xcite .    in this study , we use cosmological parameters ( @xmath5 ) = ( 70 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , 0.3 , 0.7 ) .",
    "broad band emission from blazars can be usually described in the framework of leptonic models .",
    "since there is difficulty to explain seds of frsqs in a simple one - zone ssc model @xcite , we study the photon emission properties of fsrqs in the frame of one - zone , homogeneous synchrotron and inverse compton model given by @xcite .",

    "the relativistic electron distribution which we used here is the same as that given by @xcite , i.e. @xmath8+[(p_{\\rm 2}-p_{\\rm 1})\\gamma_{\\rm b}^{\\prime}]^{p_{\\rm 2}-p_{\\rm 1}}\\gamma^{\\prime -p_{\\rm 2 } } \\nonumber \\\\",
