    "i.e. _  as thermodynamic equilibrium is reached , the process of entropy maximization leads to long range order .",
    "it is not obvious that such mechanisms carry over to granular systems because the thermal energy scale is very much smaller than the potential energy required for particle rearrangement , and energy has to be supplied actively to produce sustained motion .",
    "therefore , an interesting question arises  does shape anisotropy lead to self - organization and pattern formation in granular materials ?    in this paper , we report the observation of novel vortex patterns exhibited by granular rods that are vibrated vertically inside a container .",
    "we obtain the phase diagram for the observed patterns as a function of the acceleration of the driving and the packing fraction of the rods .",
    "we find that for sufficiently large packing fractions , the rods tend to align vertically and undergo vortex motion .",
    "using high frame rate imaging and particle tracking , we have measured the velocity fields of the vortices as a function of packing fraction and driving frequency .",
    "based on our experimental observations , we argue that the inclination of the rods causes motion due to collisions with the bottom boundary .",
    "to bolster our claim , we conduct experiments with single row of rods in an annulus to demonstrate that motion is always in the direction of inclination .",

    "assuming that the distribution of voids decreases with void size , the most probable configuration will be regions of vertical rods .",

    "we also used ball point pens and pencils to check that the detailed shape of the rod and the tip is not important to this translation mechanism .",
    "we find that the translation speed depends on the driving frequency and the inclination , qualitatively similar to that observed for the vortices .",
    "the physical mechanism for the motion of the inclined rods , based on our observation , appears to be as follows .",
    "when the inclined rods are vibrated vertically , they hit the bottom plate at a point away from their center of mass . because the rotation of the rod about its center of mass is constrained due to the neighboring rods , it gets launched in the direction of the inclination",
    "thus , the greater the inclination of the rods , the further they get launched and land ( _ viz . _  projectile motion ) , giving rise to translational motion .    from these direct observations",
    "we conclude that the inclined rods form the engine that drives the vortex .",
    "the vertical rods in the center of the vortex are simply pulled around by shear induced by the inclined rods .",
    "as the number of rods is increased and the size of the vortex increases , the inclination of the rods also decreases because of greater packing .",
