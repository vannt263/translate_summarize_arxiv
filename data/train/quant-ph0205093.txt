    "supported by the convergence of many seemingly different models of computation put forward independently by turing , post , markov and others  @xcite , a thesis on the notion of computatbility has been formed and gained much credibility . the church- turing thesis which can be phrased as    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ every function which would naturally be regarded as computable can be computed by a universal turing machine . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this is neither a theorem nor a conjecture , for it is not and can not even be hoped to be proven .",
    "the thesis simply asserts some correspondence between certain informal concept , that of computability in this case , with certain logically well - defined ( i.e. mathematical ) object , namely , the universal turing machine .",
    "the thesis thus imposes an upper limit of what any computing machine can be designed to do .",
    "can this computability notion be enlarged ? in principles , there is no reason why not .",
    "proposals to overcome the turing - machine limit range from the models of mathematical principles such as continous valued neural networks  @xcite , dna computing  @xcite to those of physical nature based on general arguments  @xcite , relativity principles , and quantum mechanical principles  @xcite .",
    "we summarise a quantum computing model in this paper .",
    "but first we present the quantum principles in the next section .",
    "so , what are the extra - logical features of quantum mechanics that would enable an enlargement of computability ? following feynman , we will employ the gedanken ",
    "simple \" two - slit experiment , figure 1 , to point out all that can and can not be known about , but will be manifest in the weird reality of quantum physics .",
    "this thought experiment is about a plane wave of electrons  all of the electrons in which have a single , well - defined value for the momentum  passing through two slits one by one before arriving at a detection screen where each electron can be recorded at a definite position on the screen and at a definite moment in ( laboratory ) time .    [ figone ]",
    "one important property of quantum mechanics is the randomness in the outcome of a quantum measurement .",
    "even if we prepare the initial quantum states to be _ exactly _ the same in principle , ( say , the plane - wave state for the electrons ) we can still have different and random outcomes in subsequent measurements ( like finding out which slit of the two that an electron so prepared would go through , or where the electron would land on the final screen ) .",
    "such randomness is a fact of life in the quantum reality of our universe .    to reflect that intrinsic and inevitable randomness , the best that quantum mechanics , as a physical theory of nature , can do is to list , given the initial conditions , the possible values for measured quantities and the probability distributions for those values .",
    "both the values and the probability distributions are _ computable _ in the sense that they can be evaluated algorithmically to any desirable accuracy  @xcite .",
    "this definition of computability of a number when it can be evaluated to any degree of accuracy is sufficient to interpret the number and to establish its relationship with other numbers .",
    "on the other hand , not only the values registered in the measurement of some measurable but also the associated probability distributions are _ measurable _ in the sense that they can be obtained to any desirable accuracy by the act of physical measurements  @xcite . normally , the values for measurable are quantised so they can be obtained exactly ; the probability distributions are real numbers but can be obtained to any given accuracy by repeating the measurements again and again ( each time from the same initial quantum state ) until the desired statistics can be reached .",
    "that is how the computable numbers from quantum mechanics can be judged against the measurable numbers obtained from physical experiments .",
    "thus far , there is no evidence of any discrepancy between theory and experiments .",
    "randomness is , by mathematical definition , incompressible and irreducible . in algorithmic information theory ,",
    "chaitin  @xcite defines randomness by program - size complexity : a binary string is considered random when the size of the shortest program that generates that string is not  smaller \" than the size of the string itself .",
    "we refer the readers to the original literature for more technically precise definitions for the cases of finite and infinite strings .    another way to see that randomness does entail infinity",
    "is given by an interesting argument by stannett  @xcite based on knig s lemma which states that any finitely - branching tree which contains infinitely many terminal nodes must also contain an infinite path .",
    "it is pointed out that a classical algorithm which could generate a truly random binary sequence must contain infinitely many terminal nodes ( c.f . the program - size definition for randomness ) .",
    "if this algorithm is recursive then it is possible that it may run forever without halting ( that is , along the infinite path enabled by the knig s lemma ) in the generation of some single digit of the sequence . as such , the algorithm does not really exist , for it can not really generate a sequence if it is stuck indefinitely at the generation of some intermediate bit somewhere in the sequence .    in sharp contrast , we can exploit nature to generate an infinite binary sequence which is random just by , say , repeatedly detecting which of the two slits ( hence the binary valuedness ) the plane - wave electron goes through one by one .    thus , paradoxically , the quantum reality of nature somehow allows us to _ compress _ the _ infinitely incompressible _ randomness into the _ apparently finite _ act of preparing the same quantum state over and over again for subsequent measurements !",
    "infiniteness implied by randomness is not , however , the only implied infinity that is embraced by quantum reality .",
    "quantum mechanics suggests that an electron would explore an infinite number of paths in going from one point to another ( say , from one slit to a point on the screen , in which case an infinity is somehow  contained \" in the _ finite _ distance between the slit and the screen ! ) .",
    "this infinite multiplicity of the paths taken forms the basis for feynmann path integral formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "an infinity within the finite would normally entail inconsistency  or so one would deduce from mathematical logic .",
    "amazingly , quantum reality manages to maintain the required consistency by changing the outcome of the measurement as soon as we try to detect / confirm the infinity by identifying the paths taken in between the finite separation .",
    "this can be illustrated by and is in fact born out in the entirely different pattern ( of no interference , see ( a ) in fig . 1 . ) which will be recorded on the screen if we try to detect which of the two slits the electrons have gone through on their way there .",
    "the quantum mechanically implied infinity is both needed for and consistent with the finitely measured !      the above peculiar properties can be captured and manisfest in the peculiarity of quantum logic .",
    "in contrast to the classical logic of propositional calculus , quantum propositions @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( each has a value of being either true or false ) do not in general satisfy the distributivity or modularity property  @xcite ; that is , @xmath3    an heuristic example of this inequality can also be found in the gedanken two - slit experiment if we label the propositions as    * @xmath0 : the detection of an electron at a position @xmath4 on the final screen ; * @xmath1 : the detection of an electron passing through one particular slit ( say , the left one in fig .",
    "1 ) on its way to the final screen ; * @xmath2 : the detection of an electron passing through the other slit on its way to the final screen",
    ".    with these choices and with the assumption that the electron intensity is low enough such that on average the electrons arrive at the screen one by one ( i.e. no coincidence in the detection ) , the lhs of  ( [ qulogic ] ) represents the detection of an electron at a position @xmath4 on the screen without ever knowing which slit it has gone through to get there . on the other hand , the rhs of  ( [ qulogic ] ) represents the detection of an electron at a position @xmath4 on the screen when it is known which slit of the two it _ definitely _ has passed through on its way there .",
    "the former case experimentally gives rise to an inteference pattern on the screen , built up by the electrons one by one as in ( b ) of fig .1 .",
    "the latter gives rise to a non - interference pattern as in ( a ) of fig .1 , and thus is distinguishable from the former . in particular",
    ", we can find a position @xmath4 on the screen where no electron is ever detected if we have interference ( that is , at the node of interference pattern ) .",
    "for this position @xmath4 the truth value of the combined proposition on the lhs of  ( [ qulogic ] ) is thus false ; while that of the rhs is true .",
    "we then have the inequality in  ( [ qulogic ] ) .",
    "we will consider the equivalent hilbert s tenth problem  @xcite .",
    "this problem , appropriately rephrased , asks for a general algorithm to determine if any given diophantine equation has a ( non - negative ) integer solution or not .",
    "a diophantine equation involves polynomial equation of many unknowns and integer coefficients .",
    "if we can find a general algorithm asked for by the hilbert s tenth problem then we will have a general algorithm for the well - known turing halting problem ; that is , we will be able to tell if any given turing program will halt or not upon starting with some input .",
    "classically , there is no such algorithm by the cantor s diagonal arguments . for this particular hilbert s tenth problem",
    ", we can see that its noncomputability originates from the lack of a general method to verify a negative statement concerning solution of a diophantine equation . by direct subsitution into the diophantine polynomial , it is straightforward to verify whether a set of integers is indeed a zero of the polynomial as it is claimed or not . but substitution can not be used to verify _ in general _ a negative statement that a diophantine polynomial has no zero as it would require the infinite task of substituting _ all _ integers ! for a particular equation , such as the diophantine equation of the fermat s last theorem , one may be able to find a specific way to confirm that the equation has no solution .",
    "but that specific way is peculiar and only applicable to the equation in consideration , or some related equations , and not to _ any _ diophantine equations in general .",
    "nevertheless , a quantum algorithm has been proposed recently  @xcite for the hilbert s tenth problem .",
    "we will summarise the main points of the algorithm below and only wish to mention here that we consider quantum algorithms are as good as any algorithms in the sense that they can be implementable in the physical world , occupying finite time duration and finite spatial extent and consuming finite physical resources .",
    "our strategy is that we do not look for the zeroes of the diophantine polynomial in question , which may not exist , but instead search within the domain of non - negative integers for the absolute minimum of the square of the polynomial , which always exists and is finite . while it is equally hard to find either the zeroes or the absolute minimum in classical computation , we have converted the problem to the realisation of the ground state of a quantum hamiltonian and there is no known quantum principle against such an act .",
    "in fact , there is no known physical principles against it .",
    "let us consider the three laws of thermodynamics concerning energy conservation , entropy of closed systems and the unattainability of absolute zero temperature .",
    "the energy involved in our algorithm is finite , being the ground state energy of some hamiltonian .",
    "the entropy increase which ultimately connects to decoherence effects is a technical problem for all quantum computation in general .",
    "it may appear that even the quantum process can only explore a finite domain in a finite time and is thus no better than a classical machine in terms of computability .",
    "but there is a crucial difference .    in a classical search ,",
    "even if the global minimum is encountered , it can not generally be proved that it is the global minimum ( unless it is a zero of the diophantine equation )",
    ". armed only with classical logic , we would still have to compare it with all other numbers from the infinite domain yet to come , but we obviously can never complete this comparison in finite time ",
    "thus , the noncomputability .    in the quantum case",
    ", the global minimum is encoded in the energy of the ground state of a suitable hamiltonian .",
    "then , by energetic tagging , the global minimum can be found in finite time and confirmed , if it is the ground state that is obtained at the end of the computation .",
    "it is the physical principles that can be utilised to identify and/or verify the ground state .",
    "these principles are over and above the mathematics which govern the logic of a classical machine and help differentiate the quantum from the classical .",
    "quantum mechanics could  explore \" an infinite domain , but only in the sense that it can select , among an infinite number of states , one single state ( or a subspace in case of degeneracy ) to be identified as the ground state of some given hamiltonian ( which is bounded from below ) .",
    "our proposal is in contrast to the claim in  @xcite that quantum turing machines compute exactly the same class of functions as do turing machines , albeit perhaps more efficiently .",
    "the quantum turing machine approach considered there is a direct generalisation of that of the classical turing machines but with qubits and some universal set of one - qubit and two - qubit unitary gates to build up , step by step , dimensionally larger , but still dimensionally finite unitary operations .",
    "this universal set is chosen on its ability to evaluate any desirable classical logic function .",
    "our approach , on the other hand , is from the start based on infinite - dimension hamiltonians and also based on the special properties and unique status of their ground states .",
    "the unitary operations are then followed as the schrdinger time evolutions .      the quantum algorithm is based on the key ingredients of :    * the exactitude , to the level required , of the theory of quantum mechanics in describing and predicting physical processes . * our ability to physically implement certain hamiltonians having infinite numbers of energy levels ; * our ability to physically obtain and verify some state as the desirable ground state ;    if any of these is not achievable or approximable with controllable accuracy , the quantum algorithm simply fails and further modifications may or may not work .    without any known physical principles outlawing these key assumptions , we sketch here an approach to obtain and verify the desirable ground state of the hamiltonian corresponding to the diophantine polynomial in consideration .",
    "it is in general easier to implement a hamiltonian @xmath5 than to obtain its ground state @xmath6 .",
    "we thus should start the computation in yet a different and readily obtainable initial state @xmath7 , which is the ground state of some other hamiltonian , @xmath8 , then deform this hamiltonian @xmath8 adiabatically in time into the hamiltonian whose ground state is the desired one , through a time - dependent process represented by an interpolating hamiltonian @xmath9 , for @xmath10 changes from 0 to 1 .",
    "the theorem of quantum adiabtic processes ensures that we can get arbitrarily close to the ground state @xmath6 of @xmath5 .",
    "figures 2 and 3 below give an heuristic illustration of the quantum adiabatic theorem , which can be exploited for optimisation problems .",
    "[ fig2 ]    [ fig3 ]    in order to solve the hilbert s tenth problem we need on the one hand such time - dependent physical ( adiabatic ) processes to arrive at a candidate state . on the other hand ,",
    "the theory of quantum mechanics can be used to verify whether this candidate is the ground state through the usual statistical predictions from the schrdinger equation with a truncated number of energy states of the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath11 .",
    "this way , we can overcome the problem of which states are to be included in the truncated basis for a numerical study of quantum mechanics .",
    "this also reconciles with the cantor diagonal arguments which state that the problem could not be solved entirely in the framework of classical computation .",
    "the key factor in the ground state verification is _ the probability distributions _ , which are _ both _ computable from a numerical study of quantum mechanics ( that is , with the control in the calculation to reach any desirable accuracy ) _ and _ measurable in practice ( i.e. , by repeating the physical processes to obtain the statistics to any desirable accuracy ) . by matching the calculated with the measured , both of which depend on the evolution time which we can vary , we then can unambiguously identify the ground state of the final hamiltonian .",
    "the information about the existence of solution , or lack of it , for the given diophantine polynomial can be inferred through some further quantum measurements on this ground state .",
    "it is worth noting that we have here a peculiar situation in which the computational complexity , that is , the evolution time , might not be known exactly _ before _ carrying out the quantum computation  although it can be estimated approximately .",
    "proof , be it mathematical or general , is the means to an end : a proof is there to explain , convince or persuade the others ( and even oneself ) the  truthful \" value of certain statement(s ) .",
    "a classical proof , based on classical logic , starts with a finite number of axioms from which a finite number of subsequent / intermediate statements can be derived with the help of a finite number of inference rules . and",
    "it ends with a final statement , the  truth \" .",
    "all these finiteness requirements are there to ensure the reproducibility of the proof in a finite time and manner .",
    "a classical algorithm is a particular case of such a type of proof , with input being ( part of ) the axioms and output the final  truth \" .",
    "deutsch and some others  @xcite see such a classical proof / algorithm as an _ object _ , static with intermediate records . on the other hand and in contrast ,",
    "quantum algorithms are seen as dynamical processes wherein the intermediate  steps \" can not be recorded without destroying the interference and thus the algorithms themselves .",
    "the intermediate quantum  steps \" , as a matter of facts , can not be even made out as clearly defined , discrete steps , expressible in terms of classical propositions .",
    "the requirement of finiteness of the number of intermediate steps in a classical proof is no longer relevant ( and unobtainable in a quantum proof anyway ) if consistency is maintainable and reproducibility is achievable in quantum  proofs \" .    for such quantum proofs to be credible , they must be consistent : a statement and its negation can not be proved at the same time under the same conditions . in basing the notion of proof on the physical reality , the condition of consistency should be automatically and implicitly guaranteed , for after all there is only one reality  or at most one which we can perceive .",
    "signs of inconsistency would not be pointing to something intrinsic of the reality , but would be only because of our perception or understanding of reality .",
    "in other words , inconsistency , as we see it , can not refute the reality ; it only hints that it is time we need a new theory of nature , which in turn may or may not affect the  proof . \"    for such quantum proofs to be of some usefulness , they must be repoducible : reproducible in a finite duration of time , reproducible in at different locations and reproducible at different times .",
    "the latter two requirements are ensured by the principles of invariance under spatial and temporal translations , which are some of the most cherished physical principles .",
    "these principles can be tested , and have been tested extensively to the hisghest accuracy without any failures , via their consequences in the conservation of energy and linear momentum .",
    "but can they , the quantum proofs , be acceptable as proofs ? we would prefer an affirmative answer even though the answer to this question might only be a matter of taste",
    ".    it should be easier to accept a quantum process a proof if the end result of the quantum process can be verified by classical means  for instance , in a factoring problem , the obtained primes can be easily multiplied together to give back the original number as a check .",
    "similarly , a quantum process should also be acceptable as a valid proof even if such _",
    "direct _ verification can not be carried out as a matter of principle but the result somehow can be verified indirectly through some other ( physical or mathematical ) handles .",
    "this is the case of our algorithm for hilbert s tenth problem above where we only need to verify that some state is indeed the ground state , a physical attribute only indirectly linked to the mathematical solutions sought .",
    "the authors whose quotation is quoted at the beginning of this article have also argued that even when , as a matter of principles , there is no direct nor indirect verifications possible , quantum process should still be considered as valid means of proof , simply because of  our acceptance of the physical laws underlying the computing operations . \"",
    "in this paper we review the important characters of quantum principles and put forward the arguments that these physical principles may help compute some of the classically noncomputable .",
    "we also outline a recently proposed quantum algorithm for the hilbert s tenth problem , and emphasise the key role of probability distributions in the crucial verification , of a physical nature , for the solution for this classically noncomputable problem .",
    "it remains to be seen if and when the quantum algorithm can be physically realised .",
    "if not prohibited by any physical principles , and we know none so far , then we trust that it can be implementable and will be realisable .",
    "whatever the case it may turn out to be , our investigation has already opened up new and interesting directions for mathematics itself .",
    "our quantum algorithm has inspired a reformulation of the hilbert s tenth problem , a problem in the domain of the discrete integers , in terms of a set of infinitely coupled differential equations over continuous variables  @xcite .",
    "this may lead to new insights and/or solution of the problem ( recalled that , despite the mathematical noncomputability of hilbert s tenth problem , there does exist a general procedure to decide whether any given polynomial with many unknowns and _ real _ ( continuous ) coefficients has _ real _ solutions or not  @xcite . )    our decidability study here in the framework of quantum mechanics only deals with the property of being diophantine , which does not cover the property of being arithmetic in general ( which could involve unbounded universal quantifiers ) .",
    "this entails that our consideration has no direct consequences on gdel s incompleteness theorem .",
