    "the findings of ref.s  [ ] on periodically - driven disordered systems subject to a local driving falls into the same category : many - body localized ( mbl ) systems are effectively integrable because they can be described as decoupled local degrees of freedom as well@xcite . when the driving frequency is higher than a given threshold , mbl systems remain localized and no not thermalize .",
    "this is in contrast to ergodic systems , which are expected to thermalize to an infinite temperature for any periodic drive@xcite .",

    "higher - order terms in the magnus expansion can be used to determine the qualitative dependence of the critical driving amplitude as a function of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",

    "the presence of a gap is known to have significant effects on the response of the system to low - frequency modes , by exponentially suppressing the energy absorption .",

    "when @xmath72 this hamiltonian flows under rg towards the luttinger liquid theory ( eq.([eq : h_in ] ) with @xmath73 ) .",
    "higher order terms are given by commutators of the hamiltonian at different times ( see appendix [ sec : magnus ] ) . because the time - dependent part of our hamiltonian is proportional to @xmath74 , each commutator necessarily includes @xmath74 , or its derivatives .",
    "with respect to the luttinger - liquid fixed point , these terms are irrelevant in an rg sense , and are not expected to affect the ground - state - properties of the floquet hamiltonian .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the ( asymptotic ) expectation values of physical operators such as @xmath75 and @xmath76 are finite ( and proportional to @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively ) , indicating that the system does not always flow to an infinite - temperature ensemble .",
    "when the frequency is reduced , the amplitude of higher - order terms of the magnus expansion increases : although irrelevant in an rg sense , if sufficiently large , these terms can lead to a transition towards an unstable regime .",
    "many - body quantum fluctuations have an important effect on the stability of the inverted pendulum @xmath6 as well . as mentioned above , this effect is related to the interplay between @xmath74 and @xmath79 in eq .",

    "in particular , the stability diagram is mainly insensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "specifically , we repeated the semiclassical dynamics for a different set of initial conditions ( corresponding to an initially gapped state with local correlations only ) and observed a qualitatively similar dynamical phase diagram .    .",
    "the critical field is determined by two independent methods , namely by observing the peaks of @xmath148 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4abc](b ) , and of @xmath149 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4abc](c ) .",
    "both methods show an initial decrease of the critical drive , followed by a saturation at a finite asymptotic value .",
    "numerical values : @xmath25 ,  @xmath135 ,  @xmath150    the above calculations refer to physical observables measured after a finite number of driving periods .",
    "one important question regards the evolution of the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] as a function of time .",
    "in particular , one may wonder whether the stability region gradually shrinks and disappears in the infinite - time limit .",
    "in other words , can the dynamical transition be induced by applying an infinitesimal drive for very long times ? to address this question , in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymptotic ] we plot the critical driving amplitude as a function of the number of driving periods .",
    "although the critical driving amplitude initially decreases as a function of time , we observe that at long times it tends to a finite asymptotic value : the stable regime occupies a finite region in the parameter space even in the asymptotic long - time limit .",
    "the number of driving periods plays an analogous role to the size of the system in equilibrium phase transitions : when appropriately rescaled , any physical quantity is associated with a well - defined asymptotic scaling limit ( see appendix [ app : scaling ] ) .",
    "the present calculations demonstrate the existence of a localized ( non - ergodic ) phase in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "following dalessio @xcite , this result can be interpreted as a ( many - body ) energy localization transition .",
    "remarkably , the present semiclassical approach involves the solution of classical equations of motion ( subject to quantum initial conditions ) .",
    "our findings are in contrast to an earlier conjecture formulated in the context of mbl systems with randomness by oganesyan @xcite and suggesting that such a transition has a pure quantum origin and does not occur in classical systems .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] we now offer more details about the two physical realizations that were anticipated in fig .  [",
    "fig : discrete_model ] .",
    "the two proposed experiments belong respectively to the classical and quantum realm .",
    "the present calculations suggest that the two model should have a qualitatively similar stability diagram , but an experimental verification is required .",
    "the realization of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_fk ] ) using classical elements seems particularly appealing and relatively easy : this model describes an array of pendula attached to a common periodically oscillating support , and coupled through nearest neighbor couplings ( see fig.[fig : discrete_model](a ) ) .    a quantum version of the periodically - driven sine - gordon model ( [ eq : h_in ] ) can be realized using ultracold atoms@xcite . by trapping the atoms in cigar - shaped potentials it is possible to obtain systems in which the dynamics is effectively one dimensional .",
    "specifically , the transversal confinement can be generated through laser standing waves ( see for example ref .  [ ] ) , or through magnetic fields induced by currents running on a nearby chip ( see for example ref .  [ ] ) . in both cases ,",
    "the amplitude of the transverse confinement can be easily modulated over time , allowing to realize the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : discrete_model](b ) . here",
    "a time - dependent transverse confinement induces a time - dependent tunneling coupling between two parallel tubes . in model ( [ eq : h_in ] ) this coupling is modeled as @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the local phase difference between the quasi - condensates@xcite .",
    "dealing with a system of two coupled tubes , the luttinger parameter is doubled with respect to a single tube and equals to @xmath153 , where @xmath154 , @xmath155 is the chemical potential , @xmath156 is the mass of the atoms , and @xmath157 their average one - dimensional density .",
    "the luttinger parameter of a single tube is first inverted to account from the transition between the phase and density representations , and then multiplied by @xmath85 due to the different choice of commutation relations . ]",
    "atoms on a chip are characterized by relatively small interaction energies , constraining the maximal value of the achievable @xmath36 .",
    "typical experimental values of @xmath13 are in the order of @xmath158 , or @xmath159 .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 is set by the instantaneous ( single - particle ) tunneling rate through @xmath160 .",
    "these experiments are therefore constrained to @xmath161 , or @xmath162 .",
    "fig.s [ fig : phasediagram ] and [ fig : mehrtash ] show that the a wide region of stability is expected in the physically relevant regime ( small @xmath36 and @xmath162 ) , demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed experiment .",
    "an alternative procedure to periodically drive the two coupled tubes involves the modulation of the chemical potential difference between them @xmath163 ( while keeping approximately fixed the tunneling element ) . in the bosonization language of eq.([eq : h_in ] ) , this corresponds to a time - dependent field that couples to the atomic density .",
    "an appropriate gauge transformation allows one to map this problem into a phase - modulated sine - gordon model in which the drive enters through the phase drive @xmath164 as @xmath165 .",
    "we postpone the detailed analysis of this model to a future publication : preliminary calculations indicate that the stability diagram is analogous to fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] . however , we do not know yet whether the two models belong to the same universality class .",
    "the sine - gordon model is often discussed in the context of isolated tubes under the effect of a longitudinal standing waves , or optical lattice , as well . at equilibrium",
    "this model describes the luttinger liquid to mott insulator quantum phase transition of one dimensional degenerate gases ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "interestingly , the inverted pendulum @xmath6 corresponds to a distinct topological phase , the haldane insulator  @xcite . at equilibrium",
    "non - local interactions are needed in order to stabilize this phase .",
    "as explained above , in the presence of a periodic drive it may be possible to stabilize it by tuning the system in the region where only the `` upper '' extremum is stable .",
    "this situation is analogous to the recent proposal of greschner  @xcite . in relation to the dynamical stability of this phase ,",
    "one however needs to notice that the optical lattice affects the luttinger parameter as well .",
    "a correct description of these experiments therefore involves the additional transformation @xmath166 , with possible significant consequences for the resulting stability diagram .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning other possible realizations of the model ( [ eq : h_in ] ) , including for example rf coupled spinor condensates @xcite and arrays of josephson junctions @xcite in the presence of time - dependent magnetic fields .",
    "to summarize , in this paper we combined different analytical and numerical tools to study the periodically - driven sine - gordon model .",
    "we applied a controlled high - frequency expansion , the magnus expansion , to derive an effective ( floquet ) hamiltonian .",
    "employing ideas from the renormalization group ( rg ) method , we propose the existence of a non - absorbing ( non - ergodic ) fixed point , in which the system is weakly affected by the periodic drive . at a critical value of the driving frequency ( or equivalently of the driving amplitude ) , the system undergoes a dynamical phase transition and flows towards the infinite temperature absorbing ( ergodic ) state .",
    "the transition occurs at a finite value of the drive amplitude and is therefore beyond the reach of perturbative approaches . to provide a glimpse about the nature of the transition we considered the lowest - order magnus expansion suggesting that the transition could correspond to the point where the kinetic term in the floquet hamiltonian becomes negative .",
    "the existence of a transition at a finite value of the driving amplitude is further supported by two numerical methods : a self - consistent time - dependent variational approach , and a semiclassical approach .",
    "interestingly , the emergent phase diagram ( fig.s [ fig : mehrtash ] and [ fig : figure5 ] ) is in qualitative agreement with a simple - minded quadratic expansion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] ) .",
    "the dynamical phase diagram displays two distinct stability islands , respectively for large driving frequencies @xmath13 and for large @xmath167 .",
    "the former island becomes unstable when @xmath13 is comparable to the short wavelength cutoff @xmath31 .",
    "this suggests that the transition is of mean - field nature , thus bearing the same character as the parametric resonance of a single harmonic oscillator .",
    "the latter island is related to the existence of finite excitation gap , which protects the system from low - frequency drives . in both cases , we observe that quantum fluctuations promote ergodicity and decrease the value of the critical driving amplitude .",
    "the observed transitions are analogous to the stability threshold predicted in ref.s   [ ] for many - body localized ( mbl ) states , but does not require localization in real space .",
    "our findings are in contrast to the conclusions of dalessio @xcite , who argued that generic many - body system should be dynamically unstable under a periodic drive .",
    "ponte @xcite showed that ergodic systems are always unstable to the periodic modulation of a local perturbation : we find here that global coherent perturbations can display a qualitatively different behavior ( see also russomanno @xcite for a specific example ) .",

    "the second - order term vanishes @xmath173 : for time - reversal invariant perturbations , all even - order terms are exactly zero .",
