    "<S> international institute for theoretical physics and advanced mathematics einstein - galilei , via santa gonda , 14 - 59100 prato , italy    _ e - mail addresses : _    the design and construction of a number of sensitive detectors for gravitational waves ( gws ) is underway today . </S>",
    "<S> there are some interferometers like the virgo detector , being built in cascina near pisa , italy , by a joint italian - french collaboration , the geo 600 detector being built in hanover , germany by a joint anglo - germany collaboration , the two ligo detectors being built in the united states ( one in hanford , washington and the other in livingston , louisiana ) by a joint caltech - mit collaboration , and the tama 300 detector , being built near tokyo , japan . </S>",
    "<S> there are many bar detectors currently in operation too , and several interferometers and bars are in a phase of planning and proposal stages ( for the current status of gws experiments see @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> .    the results of these detectors will have a fundamental impact on astrophysics and gravitation physics . </S>",
    "<S> there will be several experimental data to be analyzed , and theorists will be forced to interact with lots of experiments and data analysts to extract the physics from the data stream .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> the stochastic background of gws ( sbgws ) @xcite , which is , in principle , a possible target of these experiments , is analyzed with the auxilium of the wmap data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that , in general , in previous works in literature about the sbgws , old cobe data were used ( see @xcite for example ) .    from our analysis , it will result that the wmap bounds on the energy spectrum and on the characteristic amplitude of the sbgws are greater than the cobe ones , but they are also far below frequencies of the earth - based antennas band . at the end of this letter </S>",
    "<S> a lower bound for the integration time of a potential detection with advanced ligo is released and compared with the previous one arising from the old cobe data . </S>",
    "<S> even if the new lower bound is minor than the previous one , it results very long , thus for a possible detection we hope in the lisa interferometer and in a further growth in the sensitivity of advanced projects .    the strongest constraint on the spectrum of the relic sbgws in the frequency range of ground based antennas like bars and interferometers , which is the range @xmath0 , comes from the high isotropy observed in the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuation @xmath1 of the temperature of cbr from its mean value @xmath2 k varies from point to point in the sky @xcite , and , since the sky can be considered the surface of a sphere , the fitting of @xmath1 is performed in terms of a laplace series of spherical harmonics    @xmath3    and the fluctations are assumed statistically independent ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fluttuazioni cbr ] ) @xmath6 denotes a point on the 2-sphere while the @xmath7 are the multipole moments of the cbr . for details about the definition of statistically independent fluctations in the context of the temperature fluctations of cbr see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the wmap data @xcite permit a more precise determination of the rms quadrupole moment of the fluctations than the cobe data    @xmath8    while in the cobe data we had @xcite    @xmath9    a connection between the fluctuation of the temperature of the cbr and the sbgws derives from the _ sachs - wolfe effect _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sachs and wolfe showed that variations in the density of cosmological fluid and gws perturbations result in the fluctuation of the temperature of the cbr , even if the surface of last scattering had a perfectly uniform temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the fluctuation of the temperature ( at the lowest order ) in a particular point of the space is    @xmath10    the integral in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : null geodesic ] ) is taken over a path of null geodesic which leaves the current spacetime point heading off in the direction defined by the unit vector @xmath6 and going back to the surface of last scattering of the cbr .    </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath11 is a particular choice of the affine parameter along the null geodesic . by using conformal coordinates , we have for the metric perturbation    @xmath12    and @xmath13 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : null geodesic ] ) is a radial spatial coordinate which goes outwards from the current spacetime point . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of a long wavelenght gw is to shift the temperature distribution of cbr from perfect isotropy . </S>",
    "<S> because the fluctations are very small ( @xmath14 @xcite ) , the perturbations caused by the relic sbgws can not be too large .    </S>",
    "<S> the wmap results give rather tigh constraints on the spectrum of the sbgws at very long wavelenghts . </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite we find a constraint on @xmath15 which derives from the cobe observational limits , given by    @xmath16    now the same constraint will be obtained from the wmap data . because of its specific polarization properties , relic sbgws should generate particular polarization pattern of cbr anisotropies , but the detection of cbr polarizations is not fulfiled today @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus an indirect method will be used . </S>",
    "<S> we know that relic gws have very long wavelenghts of hubble radius size , so the cbr power spectrum from them should manifest fast decrease at smaller scales ( hight multipole moments ) . </S>",
    "<S> but we also know that scalar modes produce a rich cbr power spectrum at large multipole moments ( series of acoustic peaks , ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> then the properties of tensor modes of cosmological perturbations of spacetime metric can be extract from observational data using angular cbr power spectrum combined with large scale structure of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> one can see ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) that in the range @xmath17 ( the same used in @xcite , but with the old cobe data @xcite ) scalar and tensor contributions are comparable . from @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the wmap data give for the tensor / scala ratio @xmath13 the constraint @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 obtained @xmath20 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if one remembers that , at order of hubble radius , the tensorial spectral index is @xmath21 , it results    @xmath22    which is greater than the cobe data result of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : limite cobe ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the limit of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : limite wmap ] ) is not a limit for any gws , but only for relic ones of cosmological origin , which were present at the era of the cbr decoupling . </S>",
    "<S> also , the same limit only applies over very long wavelenghts ( i.e. very low frequencies ) and it is far below frequencies of the virgo - ligo band .        the primordial production of the relic sbgws has been analyzed in @xcite , where it has been shown that in the range @xmath23 the spectrum is flat and proportional to the ratio    @xmath24    wmap observations put strongly severe restrictions on the spectrum , as we discussed above . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 the spectrum @xmath25 is mapped : the amplitude ( determined by the ratio @xmath26 ) has been chosen to be _ as large as possible , consistent with the wmap constraint _ ( [ eq : limite wmap ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , because the spectrum falls off @xmath27 at low frequencies @xcite , this means that today , at virgo and lisa frequencies , indicated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ,    @xmath28    while using the cobe data it was    @xmath29(refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is intersting to calculate the correspondent strain at @xmath30 , where interferometers like virgo and ligo have a maximum in sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> the well known equation for the characteristic amplitude @xcite can be used :    @xmath31    obtening    @xmath32    then , because for ground - based interferometers a sensitivity of the order of @xmath33 is expected at @xmath30 , four order of magnitude have to be gained in the signal to noise ratio @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us analyze smaller frequencies too . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the virgo interferometer is of the order of @xmath34 at @xmath35 @xcite and in that case it is    @xmath36    for a better understanding of the difficulties on the detection of the sbgws a lower bound for the integration time of a potential detection with advanced ligo is released . for a cross - correlation between two interferometers the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) increases as @xcite    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the one - sided power spectral density of the @xmath39 detector @xcite and @xmath40 the well known overlap - reduction function @xcite . assuming two coincident coaligned detectors @xmath41 with a noise of order @xmath42 ( i.e. a typical value for the advanced ligo sensitivity @xcite ) one gets @xmath43 for @xmath44 using our result @xmath45 while it is @xmath43 for @xmath46 using previous cobe result @xmath47 . since the overlap reduction function degrades the snr , these results can be considered a solid upper limit for the advanced ligo configuration for the two different values of the spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the lisa interferometer will be of the order of @xmath33 at @xmath48 @xcite and in that case it is    @xmath49    then a stochastic background of relic gravitational waves could be in principle detected by the lisa interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> we also hope in a further growth in the sensitivity of advanced projects .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the assumption that all the tensorial perturbation in the universe are due to a sbgws is quit strong , but our results ( [ eq : limite spettro wmap ] ) , ( [ eq : limite per lo strain ] ) , ( [ eq : limite per lo strain2 ] ) and ( [ eq : limite per lo strain3 ] ) can be considered like upper bounds .    </S>",
    "<S> reasuming in this letter the sbgws has been analyzed with the auxilium of the wmap data , while previous works in literature , used the old cobe data , seeing that the predicted signal for these relic gws is very weak . from our analysis </S>",
    "<S> it resulted that the wmap bound on the energy spectrum and on the characteristic amplitude of the sbgws are greater than the cobe ones , but they are also far below frequencies of the earth - based antennas band . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the integration time of a potential detection with advanced interferometers is very long , thus , for a possible detection we have to hope in a further growth in the sensitivity of advanced ground based projects and in the lisa interferometer .     of frequency , in hz . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical axis is @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the inflationary spectrum rises quickly at low frequencies ( wave which rentered in the hubble sphere after the universe became matter dominated ) and falls off above the ( appropriately redshifted ) frequency scale @xmath51 associated with the fastest characteristic time of the phase transition at the end of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the flat region depends only on the energy density during the inflationary stage ; we have chosen the largest amplitude consistent with the wmap constrain discussed earlier : @xmath52 at @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that at virgo and lisa frequencies , @xmath54 </S>"
