    "redshift galaxy catalogues reveal a universe permeated by an interpenetrating network of superclusters and voids .",
    "it therefore becomes important to understand and quantify the geometrical and topological properties of large scale structure in an cdm cosmology in a deep and integrated manner .",
    "the main aim of this talk is to study the supercluster - void network in cdm cosmology with emphasis on the sizes , shapes and topologies of individual superclusters and voids .",
    "concretely , we study the geometry and topology of isodensity surfaces @xmath6 . at a given threshold @xmath7 regions having higher then threshold density ( @xmath8 )",
    "will be called `` superclusters '' , while regions with @xmath9 will be called `` voids '' we employ an elaborate surface modeling scheme , surfgen ( short for ` surface generator ' ) , that allows us to determine the geometry , morphology and topology of excursion sets defined on a density field in a very comprehensive manner ( sheth 2003 ) . working with the density field",
    "also permits us to determine the morphological properties of the _ full excursion set _ describing the supercluster - void network .",
    "more detailed information is then gleaned at one particular threshold ( usually associated with percolation ) at which shapes and sizes of individual superclusters and voids yield rich information about properties of the cosmic web to which we belong .",
    "we use dark matter distributions in a flat model with @xmath10 = 0.3 , @xmath11 = 0.7 , @xmath12 ( cdm ) .",
    "the initial spectrum was taken with the shape parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the amplitude ( @xmath14 ) of the power spectrum in the model is set so as to reproduce the observed abundance of rich galaxy clusters at the present epoch ( see jenkins 1998 for details ) .",
    "the study of mocked galaxy distributions was done by sheth ( 2003 ) .",
    "surfgen operates on three - dimensional pixelized maps .",
    "therefore we first generate the density field from the distribution of dark matter particles .",
    "this process was described in detail in sheth ( 2003 ) ; here we present a brief summary .",
    "the data consist of @xmath15 particles in a box of size 239.5 1 mpc .",
    "we fit a @xmath16 grid to the box .",
    "we follow the smoothing technique used by springel ( 1998 ) which they adopted for their preliminary topological analysis of the virgo simulations .",
    "we study the field smoothed with @xmath1 1 mpc which is a fiducial smoothing scale in many studies of both density fields in n - body simulations and galaxy fields from redshift surveys ; see for example , grogin & geller ( 2000 ) .",
    "the gaussian kernel for smoothing that we adopt here is @xmath17 .",
    "since the kernel is isotropic and uniform , it is likely to diminish the true extent of anisotropy in filaments , pancakes and voids .",
    "this effect could be minimized by considering adaptive kernels or smoothing techniques based on the wavelet transform .",
    "an even more ambitious approach is to reconstruct density fields using delaunay tesselations using a technique reported by van de weygaert ( 2002 ) .",
    "four minkowski functionals are effective non - parametric descriptors of the morphological properties of surfaces in three dimensions mecke ( 1994 ) .",
    "they are : _ volume _ @xmath18 enclosed by the surface , @xmath19 ; _ area _",
    "@xmath20 of the surface ; _ integrated mean curvature _ @xmath21 of the surface @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the principal radii of curvature at a given point on the surface ; and finally , _ the euler characteristic _ @xmath25 the genus is uniquely related to the euler characteristic @xmath26 and thus carries exactly the same information .",
    "we measure the above parameters for every region in both over - dense and under - dense excursion sets at 99 density thresholds equispaced in the filling factor from @xmath27 to @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fraction of the total volume occupied by the excursion set .",
    "as demonstrated in sahni ( 1998 ) and sathyaprakash ( 1998 ) particular ratios of minkowski functionals called `` shapefinders '' provide us with a set of non - parametric measures of sizes and shapes of objects .",
    "therefore , in addition to determining mfs we shall also derive three quantities having the dimensions of length that can be associated with three characteristic sizes : @xmath30 ( thickness ) , @xmath31 ( breadth ) and @xmath32 ( length ) defined as follows : @xmath33 the three shapefinders describing an individual region bounded by one or several isolated surfaces of constant density have dimensions of length and provide us with an estimate of the regions extensions .",
    "the choice of the coefficients in the above equations results in a sphere having all three sizes equal to its radius @xmath34 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are only the estimates of three basic sizes ( semi - axes ) of an object which work quite well on such objects as a triaxial ellipsoid and torus .",
    "an indicator of ` shape ' is provided by a pair of dimensionless shapefinder statistics @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are measures of planarity and filamentarity respectively ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "a sphere has @xmath39 , an ideal filament has @xmath40 while @xmath41 for an ideal pancake .",
    "understanding percolation is essential for understanding the morphology of the supercluster  void network .",
    "percolation is important because the properties of superclusters and voids radically change at the percolation transitions ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . at relatively high thresholds @xmath42 corresponding to small filling factors @xmath43 the largest supercluster has insignificant volume and mass compared to the total volume or mass contained in the over - dense excursion set , @xmath44 . during the percolation transition at @xmath45 corresponding to @xmath46 , both volume and mass in the largest supercluster rapidly grow , overtaking the volume and mass in the entire excursion set , and completely dominating the entire sample from this point onwards .",
    "the largest void behaves in a qualitatively similar manner if plotted versus @xmath47 . at @xmath48 , @xmath49",
    "its volume is small compared to the volume of the under - dense excursion set , @xmath50 , but at the percolation transition @xmath51 , it takes over and from then on remains the dominant structure in the under - dense excursion set . since @xmath52 the void percolation transition takes place at @xmath53 as shown in fig . 1 ( left panel ) .",
    "two obvious conclusions can be drawn from the above discussion .",
    "first , at percolation the object having the largest volume becomes very different from all remaining objects , therefore it must be studied separately .",
    "second , individual objects  both superclusters and voids  must be studied in the corresponding phase _ before percolation occurs _ in the corresponding phase .",
    "both superclusters and voids reach their largest sizes , volumes and masses just before percolation sets in .",
    "the percoation thresholds can be accurately measured from the peaks in the rate of growth of the mfs of the largest supercluster or void as a function of @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "1 right panel ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the percolation and genus statistics .",
    "both were suggested as tests for the connectedness of the large - scale structure .",
    "first , zeldovich and shandarin ( zeldovich 1982 , shandarin 1983 , shandarin & zeldovich 1983 ) raised the question of topology of large - scale structure and suggested percolation statistic as a discriminator between models .",
    "the percolation test was first applied to a redshift catalog compiled by j. huchra and rood ( zeldovich 1982 ; einasto 1984 ) who found that the connectedness in this catalog was significantly stronger than for a poisson distribution .",
    "in contrast , a non - dynamical model having approximately correct correlation functions up to the fourth order ( soneira & peebles 1978 ) showed significantly weaker connectedness than in the observed catalog . thus , percolation was able to detect connectedness in the galaxy distribution .",
    "it was also demonstrated that three lowest order correlation functions ( two- , three- and four - point functions ) are not sufficient to detect the connectedness in the galaxy distribution .",
    "figure 2 illustrate the difference between the global genus ( fig .",
    "2 left panel ) and percolation staitistic ( fig .",
    "1 left panel and fig . 2 right panel ) : at the percolation threshold many properties of the excursion set significantly change while the global genus curve remain smooth and featureless .",
    "three characteristic sizes and shapes of superclusters and voids can be estimated from .",
    "it is surprising that the thickness of superclusters depends on the threshold quite weakly ; it is within 4@xmath546 h@xmath55mpc interval for a range of thresholds between @xmath56 .",
    "this may indicate that the actual thickness of superclusters is significantly smaller and the measured values reflect the width of the smoothing window .",
    "the breadth of superclusters is not much greater than thickness and it is likely that it is also affected by the width of the filtering window .",
    "voids are a little fatter than superclusters and their thickness reaches about 9 h@xmath55 mpc at the percolation threshold .",
    "voids are also wider and longer than superclusters .",
    "recalling that the size parameters are normalized to the radius of the sphere rather than to diameter we conclude that the longest 25% of superclusters are longer than about 50 h@xmath55 mpc and 25% of voids are longer than about 60 h@xmath55 mpc .",
    "the correlation of the sizes ( @xmath32 , @xmath31 , @xmath30 ) and shape parameters ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) of superclusters and voids with the masses ( superclusters ) and volumes ( voids ) are shown in fig .",
    "it was expected that all three sizes of the superclusters may correlate with their masses and the sizes of the voids correlate with their volumes .",
    "it is perhaps also not surprising that the filamentarity of superclusters increases with the mass .",
    "however , the strong correlation of the filamentarity ( @xmath37 ) of voids with their volumes is quite unexpected and may require reconsidering of some theoretical models of the void evolution .",
    "figure 4 ( left panel ) demonstrates that the palnarity of superclusters is quite small that indicates that pancakes are not typical structures in the @xmath57 cosmology .",
    "in addition , we have found a very strong indication of complex geometry and nontrivial topology in largest superclusters ( fig .",
    "4 left panel ) and especially in voids ( fig",
    ". 4 right panel ) .",
    "individual superclusters totally occupy no more than about 5% of the total volume and comprise no more than 20% of mass if the largest ( percolating ) supercluster is excluded .",
    "the maximum of the total volume and mass comprised by all superclusters except the largest one is reached approximately at the percolation threshold : @xmath58 corresponding to @xmath45 . individual voids totally occupy no more than 14% of volume and contain no more than 4% of mass if the largest void is excluded .",
    "the maximum of the total volume and mass comprised by all voids except the largest one is reached at about the void percolation threshold : @xmath59 corresponding to @xmath60 . between these two percolation thresholds all superclusters and voids except the largest ones",
    "take up no more than about 10% of volume and mass . both largest supercluster and void span throughout the whole space and have a very large genus .",
    "therefore neither has well defined sizes , volumes , masses or easily defined shapes .",
    "+ the sizes of voids are significantly larger than those of superclusters even in the density field smoothed with @xmath61 .",
    "the length of a quarter of the most massive superclusters exceeds 50 h@xmath55 mpc .",
    "the most voluminous voids are even longer : 25% of them are longer than 60 h@xmath55 mpc .",
    "the longest non - percolating supercluster is as long as 100 h@xmath55 mpc and the longest non - percolating void is as long as 200 h@xmath55 mpc .",
    "both are comparable to the size of the box ( @xmath62 ) and therefore may be affected by the boundaries . + the genus value of individual superclusters can be @xmath2 while the genus of individual voids can reach @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . this implies significant amount of substructure in superclusters and especially in voids .",
    "this is in a general agreement with other studies of voids ( kofman 1992 ; peebles 2001 ; gottlber 2003 ) .",
    "+ one of our main results is that voids , as defined through the density field can be distinctly non - spherical . whether this result carries over to voids in galaxy surveys",
    "will depend upon the nature of the baryon - dark matter biasing and also on whether the density field is sampled in real or in redshift space .",
    "+ the percolation thresholds as well as some other parameters depend on the smoothing scale and for smaller smoothing scales or adaptive filtering windows the supercluster percolation threshold must decrease ( @xmath63 ) and the void percolation threshold increase ( @xmath64 ) ."
