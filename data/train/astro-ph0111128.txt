    "a cosmological model with a low density of cold dark matter @xmath0 and a dominant cosmological constant @xmath1 is currently favored by recent analyses of cosmological observations , in particular those of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum ( see for instance , @xcite ) and high red  shift surveys of type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "these analyses maximize the likelihood between the observed power spectrum and that of a given theoretical model by fitting values for various model parameters .",
    "this set of parameters includes quantities that characterize the initial conditions for the evolution of the density ( scalar ) and gravitational wave ( tensor ) perturbations .",
    "if these initial conditions are described by adiabatic , gaussian fluctuations , the observations strongly constrain the present  day universe to be very nearly spatially flat @xcite .",
    "the simplest casual mechanism for producing a spatially flat universe , where large  scale structure originates from a primordial spectrum of adiabatic density perturbations , is given by the single field inflationary model @xcite .",
    "the early universe undergoes a rapid , accelerated expansion that is driven by the self  interaction potential energy of a real scalar field  _ the inflaton_. we consider inflation driven by a single inflaton field throughout this paper .",
    "the field undergoes quantum fluctuations as it slowly rolls down its potential and these fluctuations generate a perturbation in the spatial curvature @xcite .",
    "a primordial spectrum of tensor perturbations is also generated from the scalar field fluctuations @xcite .",
    "until recently , the majority of cmb data analyses have neglected the possible effects of the primordial gravitational wave spectrum @xcite .",
    "( for a recent review , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the last few years",
    ", however , there has been a growing recognition that the role of the tensor perturbations deserves more attention when determining the best  fit values of the cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "it has been found that if the tensor modes are included in the analysis , an extra degeneracy arises when fitting cosmological models to the cmb data @xcite .    further motivation for including the tensor modes in the analysis arises from the possibility that a measurement of the cmb polarization may indirectly determine the gravitational wave contribution to the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "such a contribution can be parametrized in terms of the quantity @xmath2 representing the relative amplitudes of the tensor @xmath3 and scalar @xmath4 perturbations , where the constant , @xmath5 , depends on the particular normalization of the spectral amplitudes that is chosen .",
    "given the current accuracy of the observations , it is only possible at present to place a constant upper bound on the allowed range of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "looking to the future , the most optimistic expectation we have for constraining @xmath6 is that the observations would favor a constant central value @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that a direct dependence of @xmath6 on scale would ever be measurable .",
    "motivated by these future expectations , therefore , it is important to determine the main features of the single field inflationary models that yield perturbation spectra resulting in a tensor  to  scalar ratio , @xmath6 , that is precisely constant , at least over the range of scales accessible to observations .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "of particular interest is the functional form of the corresponding inflaton potentials .",
    "such a study is also relevant to the question of whether the inflaton potential can be reconstructed directly from observations and , consequently , provides important information about physics at very high energy scales @xcite .",
    "it follows immediately from the definition ( [ eq : r ] ) that imposing the condition @xmath7 is equivalent to searching for models where the scale dependences of the two spectra are identical . in general",
    ", these scale dependences are parametrized in terms of the scalar ( @xmath8 ) and tensor ( @xmath9 ) spectral indices , respectively .",
    "these are defined in terms of the logarithmic derivatives of the corresponding normalized amplitudes : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the comoving wavenumber when the mode first crosses the hubble radius , @xmath12 , during inflation .",
    "we are therefore interested in the models that produce @xmath13 since exact expressions relating the perturbation spectra to the inflaton potential are presently unknown , the standard approach is to expand the power spectra in terms of a set of parameters that describe the inflationary dynamics through the slow evolution of the hubble radius or , in the case of single scalar field models , in terms of the slow rolling of the inflaton field along a nearly flat potential ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . to leading order in these expansions ,",
    "the inflationary models that have precisely constant ratio , @xmath6 , are precisely the power law inflationary models driven by an exponential potential @xcite . for power law inflation",
    "the spectral indices are constant and equal to each other . however , as we discuss in the next section , to next - to - leading order , the indices can vary with scale whilst being equal to each other at each value of @xmath14 . specifically , we solve the next  to  leading order stewart - lyth inverse problem ( slip ) @xcite under the condition that the spectral indices are equal at any scale .",
    "we find that for this case , power law behavior is a repellor rather than an attractor of the inflationary dynamics , in contrast to the lowest  order analysis of hoffman and turner @xcite .",
    "this difference arises because different approximations in the slow  roll analysis are considered . nevertheless , if the underlying inflaton potentials derived at next  to  leading order are to produce successful inflation under the condition that @xmath7 @xmath15 , a strong fine  tuning of the initial value for the inflaton field is required . the eternal inflation mechanism @xcite provides a natural way of obtaining the required initial values ,",
    "although in this case , the scale dependence of the spectral indices is strongly suppressed and , consequently , the difference between these models and the power law model is effectively erased .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the equations that determine the perturbation spectra in section ii . in section iii",
    ", we proceed to solve these equations and reconstruct the corresponding inflationary potentials in parametric form .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section iv .",
    "when determining the cosmological parameters @xcite , the primordial perturbation spectra are often expanded as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a pivotal scale . the order where these expansions are truncated is determined by the precision of the cmb observations . only the first two terms in each expansion are usually taken into account and the ` running ' of the indices , @xmath18 , is neglected .",
    "even so , there are still four inflationary parameters that need to be fitted to the data : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . on the other hand",
    ", the total number of cosmological parameters in the analysis can be very large @xcite , and in view of the level of accuracy expected from forthcoming observations in the near future , it is possible that higher  order terms in the expansions ( [ eq : sexp ] ) and ( [ eq : texp ] ) may have to be included as well .",
    "the large number of parameters that need to be considered allows degeneracies to arise when fitting a given theoretical model to the observational data .",
    "one way of reducing the number of degrees of freedom is to fit the ratio , @xmath6 , instead of the tensor quantities directly .",
    "the relevant tensor modes can then be deduced from the definition of @xmath6 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : r ] ) , and the next - to - leading order consistency relation for the class of single field models @xcite : @xmath23 .\\ ] ] the bounds @xcite in the observed precision of the tensor contribution to the cmb power spectrum are such that even after a best  fit value for @xmath24 has been deduced , the simplest approach to adopt when constraining the parameter space would be to assume that the value @xmath24 holds for all scales , i.e , @xmath25 .",
    "as we have already seen , this corresponds formally to a model with @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , this procedure provides further motivation for analyzing the case where @xmath6 is precisely constant , because this allows us in principle to gauge to what extent the accuracy of expansions ( [ eq : sexp ] ) and ( [ eq : texp ] ) is sensitive to the value of @xmath17 .    in single ",

    "<S> the single scalar field inflationary models that lead to scalar and tensor perturbation spectra with amplitudes varying in direct proportion to one another are reconstructed by solving the stewart  lyth inverse problem to next  to  leading order in the slow  roll approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the potentials asymptote at high energies to an exponential form , corresponding to power law inflation , but diverge from this model at low energies , indicating that power law inflation is a repellor in this case . </S>",
    "<S> this feature implies that a fine  tuning of initial conditions is required if such models are to reproduce the observations . </S>",
    "<S> the required initial conditions might be set through the eternal inflation mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the case , it will imply that the spectral indices must be nearly constant , making the underlying model observationally indistinguishable from power law inflation . </S>"
