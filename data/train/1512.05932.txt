    ", we analyzed @xmath24 s ( i ) for different magnetic moment directions : real in - plane ( ip ) and hypothetical out - of - plane ( oop ) antiferromagnetic ( afm ) orderings , and ( ii ) for normal and enhanced soc strengths .",
    "as discussed below , the oop configuration is related to the magnetic structure of sr@xmath2ir@xmath0o@xmath33 ( 327 ) system . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , calculated @xmath24 s for the oop case are plotted .",
    "compared to the ip case , the oop case shows quite different response of the electronic structure to the substrate strain .",
    "the overall shifts are very large for the oop case .",
    "as the substrate changes from lao to gso , @xmath13 peak positions change by 0.10 ev and 0.24 ev for the ip and the oop , respectively , while @xmath14 peak positions change by @xmath34 ev and 0.28 ev for the ip and the oop , respectively .",
    "namely , when the 214 system has the ip - afm ordering , the electronic structure is rather robust against the epitaxial strain , whereas , when the system has the oop - afm ordering , the overall electronic structure becomes more susceptible to the strain .",
    "in fact , boseggia _ _ et al.__@xcite linked the ip magnetic ordering in 214 to the @xmath3=1/2 electronic structure , on the basis of its insensitiveness to the structural distortion , which is in agreement with our calculations .    when the soc strength of the system is doubled ( 2@xmath32soc ) , the most pronounced effect is the large shift - down in energy of @xmath35 state , as schematically plotted in fig . [ fig1](b ) and ( c ) , which is reflected by the huge shift - up of the @xmath14 peak in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) .",
    "another notable change is the reduction in the relative intensity of @xmath13 and @xmath14 peak ( @xmath30/@xmath31 ) . as each substrate case has different @xmath36 value ( 1.72 , 1.57 , and 1.44 for lao , sto and gso ( for 1@xmath32soc ip case ) ) and as there is @xmath37 dependence in the optical conductivity , the intensity is not to be defined by the height of each peak .",

    "@xcite have shown , the @xmath14 peak , that is thought to arise from transition from low - lying @xmath3=3/2 band to @xmath3=1/2 uhb in a simple picture , has in fact large @xmath3=1/2 lhb contributions . with increasing the soc parameter , @xmath3=1/2 and @xmath3=3/2 bands",
    "are decoupled , and @xmath30/@xmath31 is diminished because of the reduction of @xmath3=1/2 contribution to @xmath14 peak .",

    "fig3](c ) and ( d ) , regardless of moment directions and substrate types ( see table  [ 214_m ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , @xmath30/@xmath31 ratio is found to decrease systematically upon strain , as shown in table  [ 214_m ] for different substrate strain cases .",
    "this feature suggests that the tensile strain acts similarly to the increased soc strength .",
    "the ratio of orbital and spin magnetic moment ( @xmath29 ) also shows similar trend . as the tensile strain is applied , the @xmath29 value increases and approaches to 2 ( see table  [ 214_m ] ) , which corresponds to a value for the ideal @xmath3=1/2 state of strong soc limit .",
    "the @xmath14 peak shift , which occurs for increased soc strength ( 2@xmath32soc ) , has been observed in the experiment @xcite , even though it is not identified within our studied substrate - strain range .",
    "this feature indicates that the soc can be enhanced effectively by means of the tensile strain .",
    "however , according to the atomic microscopic model , the strain - dependent hopping parameter is also found to produce similar optical behavior for a fixed soc strength .",
    "thus the overall optical behaviors are expected to come from combined effects of both the soc strength and hopping parameters . for the oop - afm case , upon tensile strain , similar reduction of @xmath30/@xmath31",
    "is obtained , but @xmath29 decreases as opposed to the ip case ( see table  [ 214_m ] ) .",
    "this feature occurs due to the eventual breakdown of @xmath3=1/2 electronic state rather than the increase in the soc strength .",
    "table  [ 214_2 ] provides the band gap dependence on the magnetic moment direction in 214 system . considering that the ideal @xmath3=1/2 picture is validated in the insulating limit ,",
    "the overall increasing behavior of the band gap upon strain is quite reasonable .",

    "figure  [ fig4](a ) and ( b ) presents @xmath24 s with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "dominant optical spectra are attributed to the electron - hole ( e - h ) excitations in the vicinity of the mott gap . with increasing @xmath6 ,",
    "the optical peaks shift up due to the enhancement of mott gap .",
    "in addition , the shape of optical spectrum varies depending on @xmath6 values .",
    "the change from three - peak to two - peak structure is observed .",
    "interesting finding is that the middle - peak is depleted when the shape of optical spectrum changes .",
    "it is expected to occur due to the fano - type coupling between the spin - orbit ( so ) exciton and e - h excitation of @xmath15 band  @xcite .",
    "whether three - peak structure really appears in @xmath24 of iridate is not so certain , because the four - site cluster we have considered in fig .  [ fig4 ] may not be sufficient to describe full kinetics of lattice .",
    "however , it is legitimate to infer that some optical spectral - weight transfer to higher peak ( @xmath14 peak ) occurs with increasing @xmath6 , which corresponds to tensile strain behavior .    ) and spin - orbit strengths ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "* other parameters are the same as in ref .",
    ", width=321 ]    when the soc increases , the splitting between @xmath15 and @xmath42 bands increases and the mott gap is slightly enhanced .",
    "these features are well reflected in the optical conductivity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "the lowest energy peak becomes slightly higher and the highest energy peak shifts up somehow , when @xmath41 increases .",
    "as in the case of the weak @xmath6 ( @xmath431.8 ev ) , a three - peak structure appears for large @xmath41 ( @xmath44 0.45 ev ) .",
    "it happens because the fano - type coupling is weakened as the excitation energy of the so exciton becomes higher than that of the e - h excitations .",
    "because some spectral weights depleted for small @xmath41 are recovered , the spectral weight near the @xmath14 peak diminishes when @xmath41 becomes larger .",
    "@xmath30/@xmath31 behavior shows the reduction upon increasing @xmath41 , which also mimics the tensile strain effect in the _ ab initio_-based optical data , suggesting the effective increase of soc strength .",
    "note that , in the current model approach , @xmath30/@xmath31 is also affected by the change in the hopping parameters due to substrate strain , namely , the enhanced hopping between @xmath15 bands and the reduced hopping between @xmath15 and @xmath35 bands , under the tensile strain .",
    "thus , regarding the peak intensities , the enhanced optical spectral weight of e - h excitation of @xmath15 is expected to yield similar effect to the enhanced soc strength .    in general",
    ", care should be taken for applying low - energy atomic model to itinerant 5@xmath5 system . since the intensity of @xmath24 in the model approach",
    "is obtained by the sum of possible four spectral weights from @xmath45 multiplet configurations @xcite , the analysis of the each spectral weight upon parameter change is possible . in the _ ab initio _",
    "methods however , the strain - dependent change in @xmath30/@xmath31 can be the result of cooperative changes in many physical parameters , not solely from soc strength . as we have seen in the ip and oop cases ,",
    "the additional information on @xmath29 change is necessary to conclude that the primary tuning parameter in the ip case is the soc strength , while it is not in the oop case .",
    "the opposite behavior of @xmath29 for ip and oop can also be understood in terms of a simple atomic picture . for a state close to ideal @xmath3=1/2 state",
    ", @xmath29 can be expressed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( @xmath41 : soc strength ) represents small deviation from the ideal cubic case due to tetragonal crystal field splitting ( @xmath48 ) ( see supplement materials for the derivation )  @xcite .",
    "considering itinerant character of 5@xmath5 system , atomic model may not access the full description of the system , but the strain dependency is expected to be well - described . as @xmath49 goes more negative upon tensile strain , the ip ( oop ) case shows clear increase ( decrease ) in @xmath29 .",
    "the more rapid decrease for the oop case agrees well with the tendency shown in eq . and",
    "( see table  [ 214_m ] ) .    the different strain dependence between 214 and sr@xmath2ir@xmath0o@xmath33 ( 327 ) system are also expected to come from the different magnetic moment directions , as the former and the latter have ip and oop - afm orderings , respectively .",
    "the strain dependence of 327 system resembles the hypothetical oop - afm phase of 214 system @xcite , which suggests that the response of electronic structure upon strain is more related to the moment direction than to the dimensionality of the sr - iridates .",
    "the tensile strain can effectively change the @xmath3=1/2 nature of the system through the change of the moment direction as well as the change in the electronic correlation @xcite . in conjunction with recent analysis on resonant x - ray scattering of iridate systems , we corroborate that the moment direction plays a role of another degree of freedom that can be tuned using the substrate engineering , especially , for a system with many competing energy scales @xcite .",
    "the 2@xmath32soc cases show overall similar strain trends , but with more robustness of the electronic structures .",
    "as can be seen by increased @xmath29 along with reduced @xmath30/@xmath31 ( table  [ 214_m ] ) , the electronic structure for the 2@xmath32soc becomes closer to that of @xmath3=1/2 state , which is reflected by highly reduced optical peak shifts upon external strain in fig.[fig3](c ) .    according to jackeli _",
    "et al._,@xcite the magnetic moment direction of the @xmath3=1/2 system can be changed by changing tetragonality . in our studied substrate - range , however , the magnetic structure of the system remains ip - afm , which is more stable than oop - afm by  100 mev / f.u .. the 2@xmath32soc cases show even larger energy difference between ip and oop - afm , which indicates the strong interconnection between the @xmath3=1/2 electronic structure and the magnetic moment direction of the system . according to recent study @xcite , much larger tetragonality change is needed for the change of magnetic moment direction .",
    "before we move on , we want to comment on the possible magneto - electric effect . as the tensile strain increases , the overall electronic structures of 214 system between the ip and oop cases become progressively distinct , which is revealed by the differences in @xmath30/@xmath31 , @xmath29 , and the optical conductivity shapes for different substrates ( table  [ 214_m ] and fig .",

    "different electronic structures between ip and oop moment directions can be used to generate strong magneto - electric effect , especially for strained system , as such by applying the strong magnetic field .",

    "finally , we want to discuss the low - energy electronic structure of 113 system upon strain .",
    "even though the strain dependency is highly reduced with respect to 214 system due to the dimensionality change , the narrow - band semimetallic nature of 113 system near the fermi level ( @xmath50 ) makes the system very tunable upon small change of external parameters in low - energy scales . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a)-(c ) , overall band structures of 113 system on different substrates are similar to that of bulk system @xcite , but there are a few points to be pointed out .",
    "first , we found that 113 system on sto has almost cubic electronic structure , which can be recognized by the highest @xmath51 band location near 2 ev above @xmath50 .",
    "the tetragonal crystal field in the presence of the substrate strain lifts the degeneracy of @xmath51 states with lowering one out of two @xmath51 states ( @xmath52 for lao and @xmath53 for gso ) toward @xmath50 .",

    "i.e. _ at @xmath56 and @xmath57 for lao and near @xmath58 for gso . for the sto case ,",
    "the morphologies of hole pockets are in - between lao and gso cases , with very narrow band character near @xmath59-@xmath60 and @xmath57-@xmath59 , which enables easy tune upon the epitaxial strain .",
    "the fermi surface topology also changes accordingly , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](d)-(f ) .",
    "in relation to recent experiments , heavier effective mass of hole carriers than electron carriers @xcite can be identified from the band structure of sto substrate case ( fig . [ fig6](b ) ) .",
    "more symmetric electron - hole band structure for tensile strain case is also consistent with transport measurement @xcite . under compressive",
    "strain , electron pockets at @xmath6 and @xmath61 , and hole pocket at @xmath57 are formed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) and ( d ) , which are in good agreement with angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite .",
    "in view of small band renormalization factor of 1.25 from arpes experiment for 113 system @xcite , our results successfully explain the low - energy electronic structure for both compressive and tensile strain cases , and suggest further possibility of manipulating the strain engineering .",
    "inconsistency of simple tight - binding model with arpes may come from the highly susceptible low - energy electronic structure of the system @xcite .",
    "suggested dirac - cone - like nodes at @xmath6 and @xmath61 from tight - binding calculation were not detected in the recent arpes measurement @xcite .",
    "our band structure shows the protected node at @xmath61 upon strain but no dirac - node at @xmath6 , which needs confirmation by further experimental studies .",
    "as the band structure of 113 system depends highly on the @xmath6 value , which is interconnected to the soc strength , a proper estimation of electronic correlation @xmath6 value is crucial from the theory side @xcite .",
    "also , recent study on 113 film demonstrated that the breaking of the crystal symmetry upon strain can lift the dirac node of 113 system @xcite , which reflects that the electronic structure of the system is highly tunable upon systematic epitaxial strain .",
    "we have analyzed the substrate strain effects in sr - iridate systems , employing both the _ ab initio _ optical conductivity calculation and the microscopic model approach . by analyzing optical peak positions and relative intensities along with obtained magnetic moment , we have found that , in layered 214 system , tensile strain can effectively tune the electronic correlation strength @xmath6 as well as the soc strength . the robustness of the @xmath15 electronic structure , which is found to be highly correlated with the magnetic moment direction of the system , can also be controlled by employing the substrate strain effect . on the other hand , in 113 system",
    ", tensile strain easily breaks the overall @xmath15 ground state , and band topology shows highly tunable hole character in the vicinity of @xmath50 .",
    "our systematic study demonstrate that the strain engineering for iridate systems , in which various energy scales compete , provides an additional degree of freedom of tunable parameters , @xmath6 and soc , as shown as peak and weight change of the optical conductivity , which can offer new dimensions on top of the current epitaxial strain studies , especially , when combined with very recent studies based on superlattice structures @xcite .",
    "we have performed electronic structure calculations , employing the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) band method@xcite implemented in wien2k package @xcite . for the exchange - correlation energy",
    "functional , we used the local density approximation ( lda ) , which has been generally employed for 5@xmath5 systems . to treat the correlation in functional level , we employed the hybrid - functional @xcite , which is given by @xmath62=e^{lda}_{xc}[\\rho]+\\gamma(e^{hf}_{x } [ \\psi_{corr}]-e^{lda}_{x}[\\rho_{corr}]).\\ ] ] here @xmath63 and @xmath64 correspond to the kohn - sham wave function and the electron density of correlated electrons , respectively .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy functional is constructed with the fraction ( @xmath65 ) of the hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange energy , replacing the lda correspondence for correlated electrons ( 5@xmath5-electrons in the present case ) .",
    "this functional form is the lda correspondence of so - called pbe0 @xcite .",
    "compared to the normally employed lda@xmath66 method , the hybrid - functional approach can treat the correlation effects of different systems in a consistent way and the non - local exchange energy can be included in the hf term . the hybrid - functional scheme has been employed for numerous transition - metal ( tm ) perovskites , from 3@xmath5 to 5@xmath5 systems , and is thought to be one of the best computational schemes @xcite . especially for more itinerant 5@xmath5 systems ,",
