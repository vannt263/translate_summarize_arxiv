    "such an oriented structure has been shown to have a high correlation to the physical properties of the material @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of significant interest to extract as many structural parameters as feasible to achieve a good insight in the structure - property relationships for such anisotropic morphologies .",
    "small - angle x - ray scattering can obtain statistically relevant bulk structural parameters for a plethora of such materials .    in small - angle scattering",
    "these anisotropic morphologies can give rise to anisotropic scattering patterns , which inherently contain an increased dimensionality of information .",
    "when such scattering patterns are sectioned , with each section treated as if it originated from an isotropic structure , invaluable cross - correlations are invariably lost .",
    "fitting of a complete two - dimensional anisotropic scattering pattern is therefore of high interest .",
    "prior work by others @xcite as well as this author @xcite on describing such anisotropic scattering patterns based on classical descriptions of data have led to useful but complicated methodologies which tend to be rather inflexible and require tuning to the sample at hand .",
    "development of a more flexible , generally applicable method is therefore rather important .    while for isotropic scattering patterns several such generally applicable methods have appeared over the years @xcite , for _ anisotropic",
    "_ scattering patterns such form - free retrieval methods have been much more slow to develop . of these , the inversion method by in particular has been a significant milestone , capable of retrieving two - dimensional correlation function for anisotropic scattering patterns . despite providing information in real space ,",
    "however , correlation functions remain difficult to interpret .    shown here , therefore , is a modification to our recent mc method @xcite to allow for full fitting of anisotropic scattering patterns .",
    "this modification leads to the extraction of three form - free distributions , with two describing the anisotropic scatterers dimensions and the third the orientation distribution .",
    "the first application results are discussed after a brief description of the necessary changes implemented to its isotropic forerunner .",
    "parameter retrieval from a simulated scattering pattern shows that the original parameters are reasonably well retrieved .",
    "we think these are encouraging results and by presenting them we hope to foster discussions towards further development of the proposed mc method .",
    "the mc method proposed here is essentially identical to that previously described in .",
    "differences can be summarised as : * 1 ) * the implementation of a different elementary scatterer : an oriented ellipsoid of revolution with semi - axes @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 whose axis radii will be denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . *",
    "2 ) * the use of the detector angle @xmath5 ( c.f . in @xcite ) , and * 3 ) * a single mc iteration uses _ three _ randomly generated numbers that define @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the in - plane rotation @xmath6 . for computational consistency ( but without a change in function ) , the previously utilised `` compensation parameter @xmath7 '' has been replaced by a `` radius - power factor '' @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "the changes in the affected mc procedural steps due to all aforementioned modifications are given below .",
    "the 2d scattering of an ellipsoid of revolution onto a detector pixel characterised by the scattering vector length @xmath10 and azimuthal angle @xmath5 can be calculated through modification of the rayleigh function for a sphere ( as used in previous work @xcite ) . here , @xmath10 is defined as @xmath11 , where the radiation wavelength is denoted as @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the scattering angle , and the ellipsoids are considered oriented with their axes aligned perfectly parallel to the detector plane , and its main axis @xmath2 rotated from the detector @xmath14-axis by @xmath6 :    @xmath15    where : @xmath16 and : @xmath17    the volume for an ellipsoid is given by : @xmath18      the initial guess of the total scattering cross - section is calculated for a fixed number of ellipsoid contributions @xmath19 ( commonly set to 500 ) whose radii @xmath3 and @xmath4 as well as the in - plane misalignment @xmath6 are randomly sampled from bounded uniform distributions . the radii sampling method is bounded by the radius range dictated by the measured q - range as detailed in the previous work @xcite , and the orientation distribution of ellipsoid axis @xmath2 is bounded by 45 degrees on either side of the fibre axis .",
    "it is important to note that the random sampling method is not quantised , so that the values can therefore assume any floating - point value within the size bounds .",
    "this initial guess is calculated using the general equation :    @xmath20    where the sum runs over all ellipsoids in the finite set .",
    "@xmath21 is a constant background term , and @xmath22 is a scaling factor , which is related to the volume fraction @xmath23 of the scatterers through :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the scattering contrast .",
    "the volume fraction of the scatterers @xmath23 is defined as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the irradiated sample volume , and @xmath28 the total scatterer volume in @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath21 are tuned to the measured scattering through optimisation using a least - squares residual minimisation procedure , minimising the reduced chi - squared @xmath29 @xcite , modified for 2d patterns : @xmath30 ^ 2 \\chi^2_r=\\frac{1}{n - m}\\sum\\limits^{n}_{i=1}\\left[\\frac{i_\\mathrm{meas}(q,\\psi)_i - i_\\mathrm{mc}(q,\\psi)_i}{\\sigma(q,\\psi)_i}\\right]^2\\ ] ] where @xmath31 denotes the number of data points , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 the measured and calculated model scattering cross - section at the position defined by @xmath34 , respectively .",

    "step two remains the same as for the isotropic mc variant , with the exception that every suggested replacement ellipsoid will be defined by three new sampled random variables .",
    "while it is possible to suggest changing only a single parameter of the original ellipsoid , this may have the potential to lead to biased optimisation and is therefore not done .",
    "after convergence has been reached , the partial volume fraction for each ellipsoid contribution @xmath37 , @xmath38 is then calculated through reformulation of equation [ eq : a ] : @xmath39 where a is known through least - squares fitting from step 2 .",
    "if this equation is calculated for all @xmath19 contributions , the volume fraction of the scatterers @xmath23 can be calculated as @xmath40 .",
    "a scattering pattern was simulated using 1@xmath41 ellipsoids over a grid of points whose @xmath10 and @xmath5 vectors are identical to that of the real measurement described below .",
    "the ellipsoids were assigned @xmath3 and @xmath4 values using a random sampling procedure over triangular volume - weighted distributions .",
    "the lower limit , mode and upper limit of the distribution for @xmath3 were 1 , 1 , and 20 nm , respectively . for @xmath4 ,",
    "these values were 1 , 50 and 50 , respectively .",
    "the orientation value for the ellipsoid axis @xmath2 was randomly sampled from a uniform volume - weighted distribution with lower and upper bounds of 80 and 100 degrees , respectively ( in all scattering patterns , @xmath5 runs clockwise from zero at the 12 oclock position ) .",
    "the calculated intensity was subsequently scaled to a maximum intensity of 1@xmath42 counts , quantised using a rounding procedure , and baseline noise of 0 or 1 count was added to all calculated pixel intensity values .",
    "the data was subsequently subjected to a 2x2 pixel binning procedure in order to get the data fitting times to within practical values ( typically on the order of hours for 50 repetitions ) .",
    "data below @xmath43nm@xmath44 is masked to resemble the real collected data , and data above @xmath45nm@xmath44 is also masked due to the unequal coverage of the angular region above this value ( i.e. beyond @xmath46nm@xmath44 only the corner sections of the detector contain data , no longer a full circle ) .",

    "as the beamstop is mounted on thin polymer wires , there is no significant shadow from a beamstop holder , and thus no gap in angular coverage .",
    "the sample measurement was performed for 14 hours per frame , with three frames making up the scattering image .",
    "the background ( no sample ) was measured for 6@xmath51 hours per frame .",
    "the transmission factor was measured by removing the beamstop and measuring the attenuated direct beam ( @xmath52 ) and the attenuated beam with the sample in position ( @xmath53 ) , the difference of which @xmath54 results in a transmission factor of 0.93(5 ) .",

    "five such frames were packed together in order to maximise the scattering signal and average over a larger quantity of material , leading to a total thickness of aramid along the beam of 0.671 mm .",

    "deadtime correction is unnecessary at the count rates encountered in this study @xcite , and dead - pixel and flatfield corrections are performed by the detector acquisition software prior to ingestion by the data reduction software @xcite .",

    "as the parasitic scattering is minimal due to complete beam path evacuation , improved statistics have been obtained by skewing the time division between sample and background measurement to favour sample measurement time @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the minimal parasitic scattering improves the data accuracy by its reduced sensitivity to inaccuracies in the transmission factor determinations during background subtraction .",

    "in addition , the distributions are reasonably well retrieved , though some of the sharper details of the distributions used for the simulation have been lost .",
    "this can most likely be ascribed to the interplay of the somewhat similar effects of aspect ratio and orientation distribution for ellipsoidal scatterers , though a similar loss of sharp details has also been observed in the isotropic retrieval studies , especially for broad distributions ( c.f .",

    "the @xmath0-axis distribution shows two clear features , one distribution at around 2 nm , and a second one at 20 nm .",
    "this result would indicate that there is a bimodal porosity in the twaron 1000 fibre .",

    "to illustrate this , two solutions were calculated for the twaron 1000 fibre , one consisting of oblate ellipsoids , the second consisting of prolate ellipsoids - axis alignment . if the @xmath2-axes are allowed to vary within @xmath6645@xmath67 from the direction perpendicular to the fibre axis ( and parallel to the detector plane ) , oblate ellipsoids are preferentially obtained .",

    "given the production process of the fibres , the existence of prolate ellipsoidal voids in the fibres is the obvious candidate .",
    "the thus retrieved data particularly lend itself to further scrutiny , as it contains the interrelations of both dimensions ( and thus the aspect ratio ) alongside the orientational information . depending on the requirements of the researcher ,",
    "therefore , the ellipsoid parameters resulting from the mc method can be plotted against one another in a variety of ways . amongst others , this allows for the study of the correlation between the aspect ratio and particle volume , or radius distribution and orientation angle .",
    "more simple parameters can also be obtained , such as the radius of gyration , the modes of the orientation distribution , and the total volume fraction of the phases .",
    "as such , we believe this is a very powerful and promising method of 2d data analysis .",
    "in contrast to the previously published isotropic mc method , this 2d variant can shamelessly be called `` very slow '' . a single mc optimisation can take up to several hours on a single core of a 1.8 ghz intel i7 ( as found in the 2011 macbook air ) , a similar timescale as the laboratory measurement itself .",
    "this appears mostly due to the size of the dataset ( on the order of a quarter million datapoints , reduced to about 60000 upon 2x2 binning ) and the need to repeatedly evaluate the ellipsoid scattering function as well as the chi - squared function with these points .",
    "one upcoming improvement therefore is the implementation of faster calculation functions for the ellipsoid scattering pattern , similar to those recently suggested by .",
    "furthermore , multicore processing will be implemented to leverage more computing power .",
    "secondly , the issues arising from the interplay between the similar effects of aspect ratio and orientation distribution may be further suppressed when cylindrical shapes are used instead .",
    "cylindrical shapes have scattering patterns which are more direction - dependent than their ellipsoidal counterparts , and contributions arising from their aspect ratio should therefore be better separable from the orientation distribution effects .",
    "alternatively , a bayesian approach could be considered in which prior information from other techniques is used to arrive at a inter - technically consistent solution .",
    "this report shows the applicability of mc methods to anisotropic scattering patterns , which can be used to extract all available information from a scattering pattern .",
    "a wide range of morphological questions can be answered through careful interpretation of the mc result . while the initial results are encouraging , improvements abound , in particular on improving the speed and accuracy of the method .",
