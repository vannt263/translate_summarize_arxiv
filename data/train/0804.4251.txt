    "* in this paper , we study the motion of a passive tracer in two simple kinematic models of the kppers - lortz instability , a classical problem in rotating convection .",
    "each model is composed of sequentially acting rolls whose axes lie in a plane and are rotated by @xmath0 . in the limit when the switching from roll to roll is rapid , the tracer trajectories limit onto a classical hexagonal convection pattern . as the switching time increases , tracer trajectories predominately lie on two - dimensional tori .",
    "eventually , these tori are destroyed and the dynamics becomes chaotic and strongly mixing .",
    "*    the mixing of tracer elements in a flow is due to a combination of stirring and diffusion .",
    "while stirring rapidly transports the tracers by kinematic advection , the associated stretching and folding of material lines and surfaces ultimately triggers diffusive processes that homogenize the tracers into a blended mixture . despite this relatively simple description ,",
    "a complete understanding of the spatial and temporal evolution of tracer elements in a given flow remains a mathematically challenging problem @xcite .",
    "this is further compounded if the tracers are not passively advected , but nonlinearly interact with fluid flow and perhaps other species .",
    "the phenomena of mixing is fundamentally important in many physical and engineering applications and it occurs at a variety of scales ranging from the very small ( micrometer scale ) to the very large ( planetary scales and beyond ) .",
    "for instance , mixing in microchannels can be used to efficiently homogenize reagents in chemical reactions even when the flow is laminar @xcite . in reaction - diffusion and combustion systems ,",
    "the efficiency of mixing reactive agents is a crucial factor .",
    "understanding transport for planetary scale flows is critical for climate modeling and pollution dispersion in atmospheric science @xcite and eddy dynamics in oceanography @xcite .    while mixing is prominent in turbulent flows , effective mixing also occurs in laminar flows that have chaotic lagrangian trajectories .",
    "the innovative work of aref @xcite gave birth to the subject of _ chaotic advection _",
    ", which provides a mathematical foundation for investigating mixing and transport from a dynamical systems perspective @xcite .",
    "aref called his seminal model the  blinking vortex ; \" it was specifically designed to yield nonintegrable lagrangian trajectories .",
    "this model can be interpreted as an idealized mixing protocol where passive tracers are successively captured by the velocity fields of vortical stirrers that are the analogues of turbulent eddies with finite lifetimes .",
    "recently , several models for three - dimensional lagrangian dynamics have been constructed out of vortical roll arrays .",
    "transport in a set of orthogonal , time independent roll arrays was investigated in @xcite . in this system long - range",
    ", superdiffusive transport only occurs along the direction perpendicular to the axes of both rolls .",
    "this flow could be realized using a combination of thermal convection and magnetohydrodynamic forcing .    in a previous paper , we studied motion in a set of rolls whose axes are orthogonal , and whose amplitudes oscillate @xcite .",
    "this models the oscillations observed in experiments on convection in binary fluids @xcite .",
    "the experiments showed that the convective instability gives rise to a sequence of temporally alternating , orthogonal roll arrays whose axes are parallel to the square boundaries .",
    "the transition from one set of rolls to the other was observed to be rapid , so that much of the time the fluid is dominated by a single set of parallel rolls . in our model ,",
    "regardless of the choice of temporal dependence of the roll amplitudes , the lagrangian dynamics is restricted two - dimensional surfaces ; consequently , our model does not lead to three - dimensional mixing , though the two - dimensional dynamics can be chaotic .",
    "our model contrasts with that of @xcite in that their rolls are @xmath1 out of phase .",
    "roll - switching was predicted for rotating convection in thin fluids by kppers and lortz @xcite . here",
    "a thin fluid layer of large horizontal extent ( i.e. small aspect ratio ) is rotated about its vertical axis . when the rotation rate is small , a stationary roll pattern forms at a critical rayleigh number . above a critical rotation rate",
    "this pattern becomes unstable to a second set of two - dimensional rolls whose axes are rotated with respect to the original roll axes by some  switching angle , \" @xmath2 .",
    "these rolls grow , causing the first set to decay .",
    "the secondary rolls then lose stability to a new set of rotated rolls and the process repeats .",
    "this behavior has been observed in a variety of experiments @xcite .",
    "typically the weakly supercritical regime shows large patches of homogeneous rolls that loose stability to rolls with an axis rotated by a switching angle that varies with the taylor and prandtl numbers .",
    "for example in water ( prandtl number near seven ) , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations confirm the dependence of @xmath2 on rotation rate , boundary conditions , and prandtl number @xcite .",
    "though the time dependence of the roll switching is not observed to be precisely periodic , there is a mean switching frequency that decreases as the taylor number increases , but increases with the rayleigh number @xcite .    motivated by these experiments , we call three - dimensional fluid flow consisting of a set of rolls with different axes , whose amplitudes oscillate a _ kppers - lortz state_. in this paper we analyze a simple model of the lagrangian trajectories in a kppers - lortz state . we begin in  [ klstate ] by constructing a time - dependent model with a simple spatial roll structure .",
    "when the switching is much faster than the roll turnover time , it can be idealized as instantaneous and the flow can be viewed as a composition of volume - preserving maps corresponding to the action of each individual roll .",
    "this gives rise to what we call a _ blinking roll _ model in ",
    "[ sec : mapping ] ; it is analogous to aref s blinking vortex model . to check the importance of the assumption of instantaneous switching",
    ", we also introduce in  [ sec : bhmodel ] a continuous model using the busse - heikes system of odes for the evolution of the roll amplitudes @xcite . when the switching angle @xmath2 is @xmath4 or @xmath5 symmetry , as reviewed in ",
    "[ sec : geometry ] , allows us to restrict our analysis to a fundamental hexagonal cell . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , computational results are discussed and mixing is analyzed using lyapunov exponents and anomalous diffusion exponents @xcite .    even when some three - dimensional mixing occurs in these models , it is usually not complete because there are families of two - dimensional invariant tori that form barriers to the lagrangian trajectories .",
    "such families of tori are prominent in three - dimensional , incompressible flows ; they play a roll analogous to that of invariant closed curves in two - dimensional , area - preserving mappings @xcite .",
    "tori have also been experimentally observed , for example , in a cylindrical container with a tilted stirrer @xcite .",
    "these are visualized with sheet lasers and fluorescent dyes and correlate closely with corresponding island chains of the poincar sections of a model flow .",
    "similar tori have also been seen for weakly buoyant tracers in a laminar flow @xcite .",
    "we investigate some of the behavior of the families of tori in our system in  [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "for the purpose of making progress analytically , we use the simplest roll model for rotating convection : the linearized solutions in the boussinesq approximation with stress - free boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "these rolls are tilted by an angle @xmath6 due to the coriolis force . in scaled coordinates with the fluid confined to @xmath7 $ ] , the roll velocity field is @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the amplitude of the rolls and @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the taylor number and @xmath12 is the critical wave number at the onset of convection . for highly viscous flows and infinite prandtl number ,",
    "roll switching starts at a taylor number @xmath13 with @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 .",
    "when the thin fluid layer is not rotating , @xmath16 , and the velocity field simplifies to : @xmath17 although a rigid lower boundary together with a free upper surface is more physical ( in which case chandrasekhar functions would be the appropriate building block @xcite ) , this choice would complicate both the analytical and numerical treatment . moreover , in the limit @xmath18",
    ", it has been shown @xcite that the stress - free solutions converge to the rigid ones outside the passive @xmath19 ekman boundary layers .",
    "trajectories of ( [ eq : troll ] ) are confined to two - dimensional contours about axes parallel to @xmath20 ( the @xmath21-axis ) .",
    "a kppers - lortz state can be modeled in a simple way by using the roll solutions ( [ eq : troll ] ) as the building blocks of the flow .",
    "our model is a superposition of rolls with amplitudes @xmath22 whose axes are rotated by angles that are multiples of @xmath2 : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the rotation about the @xmath25-axis by an angle @xmath2 : @xmath26 since each individual roll is incompressible , any composition with arbitrary time - dependence is also incompressible .",
    "we will assume that the rolls act sequentially .",
    "that is , when the @xmath27 roll is active , the amplitudes of all other rolls are nearly zero , and that as @xmath28 increases , @xmath22 decreases to zero , and the next roll @xmath29 activates and so forth .    if @xmath30 is rational , then it is appropriate to set @xmath31 , since if the @xmath27 roll looses stability to the @xmath32 roll , then the whole process starts over after @xmath33 steps .",
    "if , however , @xmath34 were irrational , then the instability would continue to generate rolls at angles @xmath35 , and the the  number \" of rolls , @xmath36 would be effectively infinite .",
    "the simplest case of ( [ eq : velfield ] ) corresponds to @xmath37 and to orthogonal rolls , as we studied in @xcite . here",
    "we will study the case @xmath38 and a switching angle @xmath39 . letting @xmath40 we then have the velocity field @xmath41 note that this model corresponds to a switching angle of @xmath0 , not @xmath42 .",
    "however , we shall see in  [ sec : geometry ] that the roll ( [ eq : troll ] ) has a reflection symmetry through the origin in the @xmath43 plane , thus these two are equivalent .",
    "when the amplitudes are constant and equal , this velocity field gives the ( rotating ) classical hexagonal convection cell @xmath44 the orbits of this autonomous system are either periodic or heteroclinic connecting equilibria on the upper and lower boundaries @xcite .",
    "the simplest model of sequential rolls corresponds to roll amplitudes that are periodic step functions .",
    "motivated by the experiments , as well as by simplicity , we assume that both the strength and the the activation time of each roll is the same . in this case",
    "we can rescale time , setting @xmath45 so that the roll amplitudes become one .",
    "the scaled roll activation time , @xmath46 , thus represents both the strength and period of the flow . in this case",
    "the roll amplitudes are @xmath47 for @xmath48 and periodically repeating thereafter",
    ".    when the amplitude is constant , the flow for the vector field ( [ eq : roll ] ) can be solved exactly in terms of jacobi elliptic functions . to get the flow for the tilted roll , we use the @xmath49 solutions of @xcite and",
    "note note that in ( [ eq : troll ] ) , @xmath50 , giving @xmath51\\\\                  { \\text{sgn}}(y)\\cos^{-1}\\delta\\\\                  \\sin^{-1}\\chi          \\end{array } \\right ) \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and the elliptic functions have modulus @xmath53 by setting @xmath54 in ( [ eq : tiltmap ] ) , we get the time-@xmath46 map @xmath55 the effective map for the other rolls can be obtained from ( [ eq : fdefine ] ) by rotation .",
    "for example in the three - roll case the resulting mapping is @xmath56 the map @xmath57 corresponds to the flow of ( [ eq : velfield ] ) over the time @xmath58 .",
    "note that since the vector field is incompressible , the map @xmath57 is volume preserving .",
    "thus , the determinant of the jacobian , @xmath59 , is equal to one .",
    "different values of @xmath2 can can be easily accommodated by the map by replacing @xmath24 with @xmath60 .",
    "when @xmath34 is irrational , we simply repeatedly iterate @xmath61 .",
    "one simple model of the temporal dependence of the amplitudes of three rolls is the busse and heikes model @xcite , @xmath62 when @xmath63 and @xmath64 are positive , this system has a heteroclinic cycle between three states .",
    "this model could also include evolution of the phases of the rolls , but we assume that these are constant .",
    "a thorough review of the dynamic properties of ( [ eq : bh ] ) is given in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath65 , there exists an attracting heteroclinic cycle connecting the saddle equilibria , i.e. the pure roll states : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "the presence of the attracting equilibria yields a system that spends increasing amounts of time around the unstable roll states .",
    "this feature is not physical , since experimental observations suggest a characteristic period of oscillation associated with a kppers - lortz state .",
    "busse and heikes offered several ideas for overcoming this problem .",

    "noisy perturbations of attracting heteroclinic cycles were first studied in @xcite .",

    "exit time distributions for hyperbolic systems are typically exponential ; however , it is common in volume - preserving dynamics for @xmath152 to have a power - law form @xcite : @xmath153 for the case of a volume - preserving map , it is a consequence of kac s theorem that the average exit time @xmath154 exists @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath155 as @xmath156 .",
    "the computations of exit time distributions , shown in fig .  [ figure10]a , are consistent with ( [ eq : exittimepdf ] ) and @xmath157 . in each case , as the theory requires , @xmath158 since the distribution has power law tail with @xmath159 .",
    "chaotic trajectories that leave the fundamental cell tend to have unbounded orbits ( though as we have seen there can also be superstructures extending over several copies of @xmath94 ) .",
    "one measure of the transport properties of unbounded trajectories is the growth rate of the mean - squared displacement , i.e. @xmath160 the case @xmath161 corresponds to diffusive motion ; however , many dynamical systems exhibit either subdiffusive ( @xmath162 ) or superdiffusive ( @xmath163 ) behavior @xcite .",
    "anomalous diffusion has been observed in many systems , for example , in two @xcite and three - dimensional fluids @xcite , plasma physics @xcite , and electron transport on semiconductor superlattices @xcite .",
    "one phenomenological model that gives anomalous diffusion of the form of ( [ eq : avegrowth1 ] ) is a continuous time random walk . in this model particles",
    "are assumed to move from one point to another under a sequence of `` lvy flights '' whose length and duration are taken from probability distributions with power law tails .",
    "such models display both normal and superdiffusive behavior @xcite . a trapping probability distribution , separating jumps by trapping events in which the particle remains at its current position for a randomly selected time",
    "can also be added to the model  in our case this distribution is @xmath150 .",
    "for this situation , the dynamics can also exhibit subdiffusive behavior .",
    "subdiffusion occurs when the motion is dominated by trapping events , and superdiffusion when flights are the more influential factor @xcite .",
    "for our model the average exit time is finite ; consequently , if there are no flights , one can expect normally diffusive behavior @xcite .",
    "though it is not easy to directly measure the distribution of particles undergoing so - called `` lvy flights , '' we can compute the mean squared growth rate @xmath164 , ( [ eq : avegrowth1 ] ) . to do this",
    "we randomly sample @xmath165 points in @xmath166 , iterating each @xmath117 times .",
    "we also compute the mean square displacement for the continuous system , though in this case , since much computation is involve we only use @xmath167 initial points and integrate for @xmath165 periods . in both cases the results , shown in fig .",
    "[ figure10 ] , are consistent with @xmath168 however @xmath161 does not always fall within the @xmath169 confidence interval .",
    "however , the least squares technique for computing the asymptotic growth rate may not give an accurate estimate of the error .",
    "in general though , it appears that these models are normally diffusive and that there are no lvy flights , unlike many similar dynamical systems .",
    "we have studied two idealized , kinematic models of the kppers - lortz state .",
    "the building blocks of the models are vortical roll arrays whose axes are rotated through an angle @xmath2 with respect to one another . in the continuous - time construction , the time dependence of the amplitude of the rolls",
    "is controlled by a stochastic busse - heikes system ( [ eq : bh ] ) .",
    "when the amplitudes of the rolls are step functions and the rolls switch instantaneously from one set to another , we derived an analytical map , ( [ eq : hexmap ] ) .    at the simplest level",
    ", the transition to chaos is governed by the the ratio of switching time , @xmath170 , to turnover turnover time , @xmath171 . as this parameter goes to zero",
    ", the flow approaches the autonomous , integrable case and when it is sufficiently small , the dynamics is similar , showing the classical hexagonal patterns observed in rotating rayleigh - bnard convection .",
    "as this ratio grows , both the flow and the map have a family of invariant tori surrounding an elliptic invariant curve . outside these tori",
    "is a chaotic sea .",
    "the tori undergo a complex sequence of bifurcations as the parameters change that we hope to report on in a future paper . in some cases",
    "we have also observed localized mixing for trajectories trapped within an invariant torus .",
    "this occurs , for example , if the central invariant curve is temporarily destroyed by a bifurcation , but the surrounding two - tori persist .    for large values of the the switching time",
    ", the lyapunov phase portraits indicate nearly complete mixing .",
    "we characterized the transport properties of our system by computing the mean exit - time from the fundamental cell and the mean - squared drift of trajectories over the extended domain .",
    "computations for the blinking - roll mapping and the flow showed algebraic decay of the exit time distribution , and the mean - squared growth consistent with normal diffusion .",
    "these results , in conjunction with anomalous diffusion theory , suggest that there is no analogue of the open streamlines in an autonomous flow or the `` accelerator modes '' of area - preserving maps that would effect long range , superdiffusive transport .",
    "we also showed that the dynamics of the flow and map models is highly correlated even when the switching time is far from instantaneous .",
    "this observation suggests that a much broader class of continuous - time models , perhaps with periodic switching between more than three states , can be accurately modeled with the blinking roll mapping . with this in mind",
    ", one could easily extend the blinking roll system to include more realistic spatial descriptions for the flow , like chandrasekhar functions , which are solutions to the linearized boussinesq approximation with a no - slip lower boundary condition .",
    "however , it would be more difficult to obtain an explicit mapping and the computations would consequently be slower . for the simple case explored here ,",
    "the lyapunov phase portraits can be computed about twenty times faster for the map than for the flow .",
    "the mapping has tori over a wide range of switching and tilt angles .",
    "we explored some of their behavior , but many mysteries remain .",
    "for instance , the middle lyapunov exponent appears to be zero to numerical accuracy for both the continuous and discrete models .",
    "while this would be rigorously true for autonomous flows or reversible maps , we do not have an explanation of this for our systems .",
    "in addition , it would be interesting to study in detail the bifurcations that give rise to the families of invariant tori and curves , as well as those that ultimately lead to their destruction .",
    "numerical studies show that destruction of invariant curves and tori typically enhances the mixing , but as of yet there is no satisfactory theory of transport for these three - dimensional systems .",
    "here , we compute the average roll turnover time , @xmath82 , for a single roll with streamfunction @xmath172 .",
    "suppose an initial condition is placed along the line @xmath110 , @xmath173 .",
    "the flow along this streamline is given by ( [ eq : tiltmap ] ) ( with @xmath174 ) : @xmath175 now , solve for the @xmath28 value such that @xmath176 this corresponds to one quarter of a rotation around a given streamfunction .",
    "this is possible since the tracers rotate counterclockwise in the domain @xmath177 . from the third component",
    ", we find a simple equation for @xmath28 : @xmath178 here , the modulus of the elliptic functions is ( [ eq : modulus ] ) and @xmath179 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . to get the average roll turnover time for all streamfunctions ,",
    "we integrate over @xmath180 to find @xcite : @xmath181 it is straightforward to show that @xmath182 is independent of @xmath6 .",
    "locating invariant curves is a more challenging task than finding fixed or periodic points of a map . for a map , the dynamics on an invariant curve is typically conjugate to a rigid rotation with irrational winding number .",
    "therefore , one can not use standard root finding techniques since the orbit never returns to itself .",
    "though there are many standard algorithms for finding periodic orbits , methods for finding quasiperiodic ones are not as well developed .",
    "one algorithm uses newton s method coupled with an interpolation algorithm to find a single point on an invariant curve @xcite . in another , the curve is approximated by a finite forier series and newton s method is used to solve for the coefficients @xcite .",
    "this this method is hindered by the assumption of conjugacy to rigid rotation number with an a priori known rotation number .",
    "we use a simple algorithm that computes a single point on the invariant curve ; however , only one point is needed since the rest of the invariant curve can be found through iteration .",
    "the method is limited because it only works for the case of an elliptic invariant curve , and it is rather slow . on the other hand ,",
    "the method has significant advantages in that it does not require foreknowledge of the rotation number @xmath131 and it is easy to implement .",
    "the first step is to choose an appropriate plane that is expected to intersect the invariant curve transversely .",
    "we fatten this plane into a thin slice of width @xmath73 and choose a point @xmath183 in the slice close to where the curve is expected .",
    "iterate the initial point and record the times it lands within the slice .",
    "once @xmath36 such near returns are found , we compute the center of mass of these points , @xmath184 . if the elliptic curve is surrounded by a family of two - tori , and these have a convex intersection with the slice then @xmath184 will approximate the position of the enclosed invariant curve .",
    "we now decrease @xmath73 and repeat the process with @xmath185 as the new starting position .",
    "this procedure appears to work well to find a point on the invariant curve to machine precision .",
    "given this point , we can now iterate to find the longitudinal rotation number @xmath131 of the curve ."
