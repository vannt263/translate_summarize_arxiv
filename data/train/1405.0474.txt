    "the resulting best fit power - law index and bremsstrahlung temperature are consistent with those measured above , i.e. , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "the flaring luminosity of sgr a@xmath30 approaches that observed from the stellar mass sample and the observed spectral index of this flaring emission ( @xmath32 ) is in agreement with the constraints on the quiescent spectral shape presented herein .",
    "the sgr a@xmath30 quiescent spectral shape differs significantly from this with a best fit spectral index of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the overwhelming majority of black holes in the universe accrete at a low eddington - scaled luminosity , yet our knowledge of the nature of the accretion flow in this state is severely lacking .",
    "herein , we have presented an analysis of all of the existing data on dynamically confirmed stellar mass black holes in an effort to place the current state of our observational knowledge in focus .",
    "modeling the observed spectra assuming simple power law or thermal bremsstrahlung models reveals the spectral shape exhibited by the accretion flow at a median luminosity @xmath34 to be consistent with : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 in the 0.3  10 kev bandpass , where the errors are at the 90% confidence level .",
    "these systems provide the cleanest possible astrophysical laboratory for the study of this low luminosity accretion flow .",
    "the results presented herein are consistent with previous analysis of quiescent stellar mass bhs , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the quiescent x - ray spectrum is distinct to that observed at higher luminosities , for example , in the so called ` low - hard ' state a harder spectral index is observed , i.e. , @xmath38 @xcite . the spectral index we measure for the stellar mass bh sample ,",
    "agrees with a scenario whereby the accretion flow changes ( i.e. , softens ) at some luminosity below that typically observed in the low - hard state ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "detailed study of the decay from outburst of a number of stellar mass bhs suggest that this softening occurs at luminosities @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such soft spectra alone can not uniquely determine the nature of the underlying accretion flow as both adaf , jet , and hybrid models are capable of producing the observed power law index ( @xmath32 ) in the x - ray bandpass , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "given the apparent scale invariant nature of the accretion flow onto black holes as evidenced by , for example , the fundamental plane @xcite , it is worth considering the similarity of the observed quiescent spectral shape of the stellar mass black hole sample presented herein to that observed from quiescent agn in more detail .",
    "the stellar mass sample studied herein lie at a median luminosity of @xmath41 .",
    "the observed spectral index ( @xmath23 ) is consistent with that observed in large samples of nearby agn at similar eddington ratios , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the quiescent spectral shape is important as conclusively identifying low - luminosity agn emission is difficult , e.g. , @xcite find a lower limit of 45% for the occupation fraction in a sample of virgo cluster galaxies .",
    "the difficulty of identifying the agn component will only increase , as in future surveys normal galaxies will be the dominant population , in contrast to current deep chandra fields which are dominated by agn , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "further constraints on the nature of the quiescent accretion flow have been provided by observations of nearby smbh , most notably sgr a@xmath30 @xcite and ngc 3115@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "sgr a@xmath30 has recently been studied in great detail with _",
    "chandra _ where it has been found that the quiescent x - ray emission from sgr a@xmath30 is consistent with a power law of spectral index @xmath42 @xcite , whereas the flare spectrum is consistent with a harder power - law spectral index @xmath43 @xcite , consistent with the spectrum observed from the galactic stellar mass sample .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "campaign detected 39 discrete flaring events from sgr a@xmath30 and although they exhibited a variation in peak luminosity by over a factor of 10 , no evidence for statistically significant evolution in the spectral shape of the flare emission was found @xcite .",
    "similar results on the shape of the flare spectrum have been suggested by previous observations from multiple x - ray observatories , e.g. , _ xmm - newton _ @xcite and _ swift _ @xcite .",
    "based on archival ccd resolution _",
    "observations @xcite claim the quiescent emission from sgr a@xmath30 to be contaminated by line of sight emission from coronally active stars / gas implying that the true quiescent x - ray spectrum from sgr a@xmath30 was unobserved .",
    "however , a recent analysis of the high resolution x - ray spectrum provided by the gratings onboard _ chandra _ has failed to detect the predicted fe k@xmath10 emission line expected if emission from coronally active stars dominated the measured x - ray spectrum , suggesting that such emission , if present , contributes no more than 25% of the observed spectrum @xcite .",
    "detailed modeling of the latest _",
    "chandra _ grating spectrum favors an adaf - type solution for the observed quiescent emission .",
    "of particular note , the favored solution is inconsistent with a classic adaf where the low luminosity is due to the advection of energy in the accretion flow ( e.g. , @xcite ) and instead favors a scenario where a large amount of the accreted material is ejected in an outflow ( e.g. , @xcite ) , hence limiting the luminosity to be @xmath44 .",
    "the shape of the _ chandra _ spectrum is dominated by bremsstrahlung emission from the inner accretion flow ( @xmath45 ) , but this component only contributes @xmath46 of the observed x - ray luminosity within the bondi radius ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .    a similar deep _",
    "study of the smbh in the galaxy ngc 3115 has been carried out where , due to the massive @xmath47 black hole , the bondi radius is resolvable at x - ray energies @xcite .",
    "the density profile of the gas inside the bondi radius has been measured , where as in the case of sgr a@xmath30 an adaf with an outflow solution is favored . in both cases ,",
    "the observed shape of the accretion flows are consistent with that produced in updated numerical models of low - luminosity accretion flows , which find outflows to be a ubiquitous property @xcite .",
    "sgr a@xmath30 is by some distance the best studied quiescent supermassive black hole , and we compare the observed quiescent accretion flow properties of this smbh to the stellar mass sample in more detail below .",
    "the flaring activity observed from sgr a@xmath30 is less luminous than the observed distribution of stellar mass systems ( see fig .",
    "[ luminosity_distribution ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , the observed spectral shapes are consistent with each other ( @xmath5 ) , suggestive of a common x - ray emission mechanism .",
    "gs 2023 + 338  is the best studied quiescent stellar mass black hole at x - ray wavelengths and it is studies of this system that have provided the best constraints on the nature of the quiescent accretion flow .",
    "early studies envisaged a pure adaf model , e.g , @xcite ; however , the presence of a radio jet in this system and numerous quiescent smbhs suggested a more complicated picture . coupled with observations of sgr a@xmath30 , which constrained the accretion rate to be lower than that expected for a classical adaf model @xcite , this lead to the development of hybrid adaf / jet models , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the most recent constraints on the broadband spectral energy distribution of this stellar mass black hole have been provided by @xcite , where it was found that the radio and x - ray emission are uncorrelated whereas the optical and x - ray emission exhibit a correlation suggesting irradiation of the accretion disk by the inner adaf - like flow ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of a correlation between the radio and x - ray emission argues against the x - ray emission originating in the jet , as does the measured low uv flux , which is inconsistent with expectations from an extrapolation of the jet component into this bandpass @xcite .",
    "additionally , as has been observed for x - ray flares from sgr a@xmath30 , the spectral shape of the accretion flow in gs 2023 + 338  displays no evidence for a significant deviation from a @xmath5 power - law despite the detection of significant variability @xcite .",
    "these points lead to @xcite favoring a hybrid jet plus adaf scenario for this system .",
    "a similar physical picture emerges from multi - wavelength observations of sgr a@xmath30 where flares in the near infrared ( nir @xmath0 1  5 @xmath48 m ) and x - ray occur approximately simultaneously , whereas as the radio flares are typically delayed suggesting a more tenuous relationship with the process producing the x - ray / nir emission , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "a model in which the x - ray and nir flares are produced via magnetic re - connection processes in the inner adaf has been shown to self consistently re - produce the observed correlated nir / x - ray flares @xcite .",
    "an alternative model where the x - ray emission is due to the scattering of nir photons to x - ray energies by hot electrons in the accretion flow has also been advocated , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the quiescent x - ray spectrum measured from sgr a@xmath30 is distinct from that measured during the flaring events , and that observed from the stellar mass sample presented herein .",
    "x - ray variability in quiescence attests to continued accretion onto the black hole in the stellar mass case .",
    "for example , the quiescent x - ray emission from gs 2023 + 338  has been observed to be variable on all timescales probed ranging from seconds to years ( e.g. , see @xcite , and table [ spec_params ] herein ) .",
    "variability on similar timescales is also observed from additional systems where feasible , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in contrast the quiescent x - ray emission from sgr a@xmath30 is remarkably constant , with no appreciable variation in the non - flare emission detected @xcite . in a detailed analysis of the flare properties observed in the _ chandra _ xvp program , @xcite",
    "find that the flaring emission component is unlikely to contribute more than @xmath0 10% of the quiescent emission .",
    "this is suggestive of further evolution of the quiescent spectrum at the lowest luminosities / mass accretion rates .    in the quiescent state",
    "the luminosity is highly sub - eddington , primarily due to a reduced accretion rate ( @xmath49 ) ; however , the feeding mechanism is different in the smbh and the stellar mass bh case .",
    "the stellar systems accrete from an accretion disk that is replenished by material from the mass donor secondary star . in quiescence",
    ", the accretion disk is truncated at some distance from the black hole , likely of order @xmath50 @xcite , with the region interior to this transitioning to an adaf of some form .",
    "optical studies of the quiescent outer accretion disk reveal an accretion rate onto the outer disk of @xmath51 @xcite , whereas the eddington accretion rate is 3 orders of magnitude higher @xmath52 ( assuming a @xmath53 bh ) .",
    "additionally , observations at uv energies have revealed the presence a significant source of uv flux likely originating from the mass transfer stream disk impact point , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in contrast , low luminosity smbh such as sgr a@xmath30 accrete diffuse gas from the inner regions of their host galaxy typically by the bondi - hoyle mechanism at large radii ( @xmath54 ) transitioning to an adaf interior to this .",
    "for sgr a@xmath30 the accretion rate is less than that suggested by the standard bondi mechanism ( @xmath55 ) , and has been constrained via faraday rotation measurements to be @xmath56 @xcite , many orders of magnitude less than the eddington accretion rate of @xmath57 .",
    "the mass reservoir immediately available to the stellar mass systems is larger than that available to the smbh in addition to being provided via an accretion disk vs the quasi - spherical feeding suffered by the smbhs .",
    "this larger mass accretion rate is likely the dominant source of the enhanced variability observed from the stellar mass systems .",
    "the shape of the x - ray spectrum from an adaf depends on the detailed physics of the accretion flow , but is expected to be dominated by emission from bremsstrahlung and compton components @xcite .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emission originates from the entire radial extent of the adaf , but the overall x - ray spectrum is typically dominated by the compton component .",
    "the energy at which the comptonized component dominates is dependent upon the input energy of the seed photons provided by the lower energy synchrotron emission , which due to the mass dependent nature of the synchrotron peak frequency peaks at optical / radio frequencies for the stellar mass / smbhs respectively ( e.g. , @xmath58 ; @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", the comptonized emission in the smbh case will have a characteristic temperature lower than that for the stellar mass systems , potentially producing a systematic difference in the observed spectra .",
    "this can allow the bremsstrahlung component to significantly contribute to the observed shape of the x - ray spectrum from quiescent smbhs , whereas the stellar mass black hole spectrum will remain dominated by the compton component .",
    "this will change in the presence of an outflow ( i.e. , @xcite ) , which results in a reduced soft seed flux for the comptonization process . due to the reduction / removal of the electrons producing the highest frequency synchrotron emission that originate from the innermost radii of the accretion flow ( @xmath59 )",
    ", the comptonization component will be suppressed resulting in a bremsstrahlung dominated x - ray spectrum . in this case",
    ", the shape of the bremsstrahlung component can provide direct constraints on the radial mass outflow rate as has been demonstrated in the case of sgr a@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that considerable uncertainty on the composition of the broadband spectral energy distribution at low luminosities remains .",
    "for example , the nature of the relationship between the adaf and the radio jet which is observed in some quiescent systems is uncertain , e.g. , both gs 2023 + 338  and m87@xmath30 produce collimated radio outflows ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the emission from the jet component can in cases contribute to the x - ray bandpass @xcite , although a significant jet contribution in the case of gs 2023 + 338  is ruled out @xcite .",
    "evidence for outflowing material has been detected in the inner accretion flow at radio frequencies from sgr a@xmath30@xcite ; however , its relationship to a radio jet such as those observed at higher luminosities is uncertain .",
    "the discovery of a relationship between the mass , x - ray / radio luminosity of accreting black holes across the mass scale @xcite , suggests that the process of accretion onto a black hole is intrinsically scale invariant .",
    "hence , future studies of quiescent accretion flows onto _ both _ stellar and supermassive black holes will play a key role in our understanding of the low luminosity accretion flow . a number of avenues suggest that further progress is imminent , for example , the ` g2 ' object approaching sgr a@xmath30 has the potential to provide a once in a lifetime insight into the accretion flow onto sgr a@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "should significant material accrete onto the black hole , we may hope to measure directly the response of the accretion flow to a known increase in mass accretion rate .",
    "further observations may hope to reveal the relationship between the outflow predicted at low luminosities , the numerous radio flares , and evidence for previous activity from sgr a@xmath30 in the galactic center ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    of the stellar mass systems",
    "both gs 2023 + 338  and 1a 0620 - 00 @xcite have been detected at both radio and x - ray wavelengths in quiescence .",
    "however , in neither case is it possible to resolve the observed emission .",
    "the situation is much improved in the case of a supermassive black hole where imaging of event horizon scale emission will become a reality in the next decade .",
    "current radio observations have probed the innermost regions of the accretion flow around a number of smbhs , where detailed study of sgr a@xmath30 and m87@xmath30 ( @xmath61 , @xcite ) have revealed evidence for outflowing material in the inner regions surrounding the smbh @xcite .",
    "the currently favored adaf models predict outflows at such low luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) and such observations promise to directly constrain this emission .    given the abundant complicating issues when attempting to constrain the low luminosity accretion flow onto a smbh , the advantage of utilizing the stellar mass bh sample is clear .",
    "unfortunately , significant expansion of the known stellar mass sample will be difficult , given the difficulty of dynamically constraining the mass of the black hole for sources lying in highly crowded galactic center fields .",
    "a new avenue would be provided by the discovery of an isolated stellar mass black hole ; however , to date no such system is known .",
    "the _ erosita _ mission will survey the galactic plane region down to luminosities of @xmath62 and the final survey may contain a small number of isolated black holes , but positive identification will be difficult @xcite , while detection of larger numbers of isolated stellar mass bhs will likely await the completion of ska @xcite .",
    "the results presented herein represent the accumulation of over 10 years ( @xmath0 570 ks ) of observations with the _ chandra _ & _ xmm - newton _ x - ray observatories .",
    "it is clear that to significantly advance our understanding on this issue , new large scale observing programs will be required .",
    "when considering the stellar mass black hole sample two immediate avenues present themselves : + ( i ) our current constraints are unable to determine if the x - ray spectral shape exhibits curvature or is consistent with a power law alone . constraining the x - ray spectral shape at energies in excess of 10 kev",
    "would clearly be of benefit here , and with the successful launch of _ nustar _ such constraints may be forthcoming in the near future . + ( ii )",
    "numerous adaf models predict the presence of narrow emission lines ( ew @xmath63 30 ev ) from highly ionized iron , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "imprinted in these lines will lie information on the geometry and ionization structure of the accretion flow , e.g. , @xcite recently used the detection of highly ionized fe xxv from sgr a@xmath30 , which they successfully reproduced with an adaf model .",
    "crucially , this data _ required _ an adaf that generated a significant outflow ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of outflows at such low luminosities facilitates constraints on black hole feedback across the entire luminosity and mass range exhibited by accreting black holes .",
    "the current best limits on line emission from the quiescent accretion flow in a stellar mass system are provided by the _ xmm - newton _ observation of @xcite ; however , at typical equivalent widths @xmath63 30 ev , the predicted linewidths are not probed . a 500 ks observation with _",

    "we note that previously @xcite analyzed this dataset and claimed that grs 1009 - 45 was not detected , with an upper limit to the @xmath65 . however , these authors estimated the background flux level via the counts in an annulus around the source region .",
    "in contrast , following the recommended procedure as outlined in the data analysis cookbook , utilizing a blank sky field , we find @xmath0 50 net counts at a position consistent with grs 1009 - 45 , see table 1 for details .",
    "we note that @xcite previously presented the results of an _ xmm - newton _ observation of this system and reported an upper limit approximately a factor of 40 less than measured here . given the 4 years that elapsed between these observations ( 1998 vs 2002 ) this suggests significant variability ."
