    "light elastic dark matter is also sensitive to the high velocity tail of galactic dark matter  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : meplots ] illustrates the suppression of the scattering rate @xmath145 ( integrated over recoil energy ) relative to that for the king model .",
    "for example , if @xmath146 , a xe target with 5  kev threshold energy has @xmath147 .",
    "this ratio is more suppressed as one goes to heavier target nuclei and/or larger threshold energy .",
    "for instance , a ge target with @xmath148 is suppressed relative a ge target with a @xmath149 by a factor of 25 . in the case of light target nuclei ( i.e. , na ) , or low threshold energies ( i.e. , @xmath150 ) ,",
    "the effect of increasing the spectral index is much less significant , with @xmath151 .",
    "the relative changes in the rates have profound consequences when comparing a potential signal in one experiment with the result of another experiment with a different target nucleus or threshold energy .",
    "this paper has considered a cosmologically - motivated class of double power - law dark matter density profiles and has examined the resulting velocity distribution , assuming isotropy and spherical symmetry .",
    "this article has specifically focused on the behavior of the velocity distribution at low binding energies , near the escape velocity .",
    "the primary result is that the velocity distribution function is well - modeled by the function presented in , where the power - law index , @xmath47 , is in the range @xmath152 .",
    "this is a steeper fall - off than what is expected for a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , which has served as the canonical model for dark matter velocity distributions in the recent literature .",
    "the new ansatz in affects the interpretation of limits set by direct dark matter detection experiments .",
    "limits on low mass dark matter , @xmath153 , are most strongly affected , especially for experiments with heavy target nuclei or large threshold energies .",
    "the analysis presented in this article does not address the effects of anisotropy and deviations from spherical symmetry , which are expected to be more serious in the outskirts of the profile most relevant for the high velocity tail  @xcite .",
    "for instance , anisotropy could be responsible for @xmath154 . for anisotropic distributions",
    ", there is no guarantee that a given density distribution will correspond to a unique distribution function .",
    "for example , if the distribution function is deformed to @xmath155 , the distribution function depends only on a single derivative of the density with respect to the potential for radial orbits of @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding velocity distribution scales as @xmath157 at low velocities , which is broadly consistent with the behavior in the dark matter only simulations of fig .",
    "[ fig : vcomp ] . in comparison ,",
    "the low velocity behavior of the galactic halo for a circularly biased system with @xmath158 is @xmath159 .",
    "thus , the low energy tail may indicate the presence of radial orbits in the halos , which would be consistent with the velocity anisotropy distribution in numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "the interplay between density profiles of dark matter halos and their corresponding velocity distribution functions was developed in this paper , but requires further study .",
    "exploring equilibrium dark matter phase space distributions , particularly anisotropic distributions , may give further insight into the behavior of n - body simulations and may explain the inner slope of @xmath160 .",
    "these effects are unlikely to be directly observable in early direct detection experiments , but may be seen in future directional dark matter detection experiments  @xcite .",
