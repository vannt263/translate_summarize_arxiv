    "holographic models of nonperturbative physical systems have been more successful quantitatively than should have been expected .",
    "the most developed applications of holographic model building are to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite , electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite and condensed matter systems , especially superconductors @xcite .",
    "arguments based on insensitivity to model details @xcite , approximate conformal invariance @xcite and decoupling of high - dimension states and operators @xcite have been put forward in an attempt to understand the unreasonable effectiveness of some of these models .",
    "holographic models of 3 + 1 dimensional systems are 4 + 1 dimensional theories in which the behavior of fields near the boundary of the spacetime , typically anti - de sitter ( ads ) space , determines the properties of the corresponding lower - dimensional system .",
    "however , gauge theories in more than 3 + 1 dimensions are generally nonrenormalizable .",
    "deconstruction of extra dimensions provides a gauge - invariant completion of higher - dimensional gauge theories @xcite .",
    "a deconstructed extra - dimensional model is a lower - dimensional theory which , below some energy scale , has an effective description in which one or more extra dimensions are latticized .",
    "deconstruction is useful for model building in that it is sometimes possible to reduce the number of `` lattice sites '' to just a few while maintaining the interesting phenomenology of a higher - dimensional model , yielding a relatively simple model of the system of interest .",
    "for example , in the context of electroweak symmetry breaking , deconstruction provides one route to little higgs models @xcite .",
    "more recently , this approach has been used to construct models with some of the properties of holographic superconductors , even though defined in the natural dimension of the superconducting system @xcite .    among the successful predictions of holographic models",
    "are certain features of high - temperature superconductors such as an enhanced ratio of the superconducting gap @xmath1 to the critical temperature @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "bottom - up holographic models of finite - temperature systems typically begin with an ads - schwarzschild or ads - reissner - nordstrom black hole geometry , the latter taking into account the backreaction of charge density on the geometry .",
    "these geometries are chosen mainly for simplicity , but in holographic models of superconductors derived from string theory @xcite , the spacetime geometries may be more complicated and depend on the fluxes of fields associated with d - brane configurations .",
    "other geometric backgrounds in holographic models arise as the induced metric on a brane embedded in a higher - dimensional spacetime , such as on the flavor branes in the holographic qcd model of sakai and sugimoto @xcite , and these induced geometries are not derived as the solution to einstein s equation with a specified energy - momentum tensor .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to explore the sensitivity of observables to variations in the details of holographic models of superconductors and in deconstructed variations of those models . as such",
    ", we consider holographic superconductors in generalizations of the 3 + 1 dimensional ads - schwarzschild metric .",
    "we find certain generic features in the phenomenology of these models , but details such as the ratio of the superconducting gap to the critical temperature are sensitive to the model details , which suggests that successful quantitative predictions in prototypical models are likely accidental .",
    "this is not to say that those models will not prove valuable in explaining the puzzling properties of unconventional superconductors , only that quantitative predictions are more model dependent than one might have hoped .",
    "it has already been noted that there are quantitative and even qualitative distinctions between superconducting models , for example between those which take into account the backreaction of the charge density on the metric and those that do nt @xcite .",
    "the work presented here focuses on sensitivity to the extra - dimensional spacetime , parametrizing the ads black - hole metric in a particular way in order to quantify the variability of superconducting observables in a class of holographic models and in deconstructed versions of those models .      here",

    "a charged field condenses in an extra - dimensional black - hole background whose hawking temperature is below some critical temperature @xmath0 . the temperature of the lower - dimensional system is identified with the hawking temperature of the higher - dimensional black hole @xcite .",
    "the charged condensate spontaneously breaks the electromagnetic u(1 ) gauge group and gives rise to superconducting phenomenology @xcite .    in this work",
    "we ignore the backreaction of the charge density on the spacetime geometry , and for now we consider an abelian higgs model in a 3 + 1 dimensional ads - schwarzschild spacetime background .",
    "this is meant to describe a system which is superconducting in two spatial dimensions , _",
    "e.g. _ the copper - oxide planes of cuprate superconductors .",
    "we can choose coordinates such that the lengths are normalized to the ads scale and the metric has the form @xmath3 , \\label{eq : metric}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 with @xmath5 corresponding to the 3 + 1 dimensional ads - schwarzschild metric .",
    "with the euclidean time @xmath6 compactified with period @xmath7 , the hawking temperature associated with the modified black - hole metric follows from the condition that there be no conical singularity at the horizon . in the absence of a conical singularity ,",
    "if @xmath8 is the proper distance from the horizon @xmath9 to a nearby point displaced only in the radial ( @xmath10 ) direction and @xmath11 is the proper circumference of the euclidean - time circle at that fixed radial position , then @xmath12 . for metrics of the form ( [ eq : metric ] ) , for small proper displacements from the horizon , @xmath13 and with @xmath14 given by eq .",
