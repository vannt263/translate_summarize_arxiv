    "multiverse theory ( also known as meta universe theory ) is a group of models assuming that our physical reality encompasses more than one universe , i.e. there exists at least one more universe other than ours @xcite .",
    "several types of such multiverses are known in literature ( e.g. [ 1 - 3 ] and @xcite ) . some of these models suggest that our reality has infinitely many universes , while others postulate that we live in a multiverse with a finite number of universes . in cosmology , the idea of infinitely many universes has received a lot of attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "most multiverse theories imply that universes might not be uniquely identified through their macroscopic state at present or past , i.e. their macrostates could be quite similar during long and even infinite time intervals .    the ultimate universe model ( also known as the mathematical multiverse )",
    "@xcite satisfies this property and postulates that every possible state is in one - to - one correspondence with each universe from the multiverse horizon .",
    "one of the most common explanations of the big - bang is given by quantum fluctuation theory , which suggests that our universe began from a quantum fluctuation , and if so , it is natural to deduce that in our physical reality these fluctuations are taking place in all of our space and time dimensions ( see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "therefore , an infinite number of such fluctuations implies a vast multiverse of infinite number of universes .",
    "the multiverse type that we shall focus on is the quilted multiverse @xcite , whose space and time dimensions presumably contain infinite number of universes .",
    "this type of multiverse was first introduced in @xcite , and was defined as follows :    physical reality contains infinitely many universes in infinite space and time dimensions ,  where every possible event @xmath0 will occur an infinite number of times .",
    "the quilted multiverse provides a theoretical probabilistic approach for the existence of events before the event horizon in our physical reality . within the quilted multiverse ,",
    "the event horizon includes events that occur infinitely many times , duplicated in infinitely many universes . in terms of tegmark s hierarchy @xcite , the quilted multiverse we shall study corresponds to a level 1 multiverse .",
    "this type of multiverse postulates that every universe in the multiverse shares the same physical constants ( e.g. the planck constant @xmath1 and the speed of light @xmath2 ) , while other types of multiverses suggest that the physical constants and even physical laws are different within different universes ( e.g. string theory landscape @xcite ) .",
    "the main argument for this kind of multiverse with different physical constants is that for different universe we would have different spontaneous symmetry breaking and thus different physics .",
    "since there are already several arguments against this type of multiverse ( see @xcite for instance ) , we will focus in this paper on the quilted multiverse where parallel universes share the same physical constants and same physical laws .    from definition 1",
    "we deduce that there are universes within the quilted multiverse that are not only close at a given time now ( i.e. similar in a sense that will be defined below ) but have been very close for a substantially large time interval .",
    "we claim in this work that the quilted multiverse is not consistent with basic thermodynamic assumptions . in the following section we discuss a thermodynamic arrow of time defined by the stability of entropy increase . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we examine some characteristics of the quilted multiverse . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we present an inconsistency of the quilted multiverse and the proposed thermodynamic arrow of time .",
    "section [ sec5 ] discusses an upper bound to the number of parallel universes in the quilted multiverse , and section [ sec6 ] concludes the paper .",
    "[ arrow_of_time ] time seems to incessantly `` flow '' in one direction , raising the ancient question : why ?",
    "this intensively discussed question can be answered in several ways by introducing seemingly different time arrows : thermodynamic , cosmological , gravitational , radiative , particle physics ( weak ) , quantum and others @xcite .",
    "we employ in this paper the cosmological arrow of time , which points in the direction of the universe s expansion .",
    "this choice implies that parallel universes with the same macrostate will have the same time .",
    "our main argument , however , will rely on thermodynamic stability under small perturbations which allows to define another crucial arrow of time - _ the macroscopic behavior of a large system is stable against perturbations as far as its future is concerned , but very unstable as far as its past is concerned .",
    "the positive direction of time is thus determined according the system s stability under small perturbations .",
    "indeed , performing a slight microscopic change in the system s past will not change , in general , its macrostate at future times , i.e. the system will end up its time evolution with the same high entropy macrostate .",
    "however , when propagating backwards in time , such a slight change in the system s future will have far - reaching consequences on its past @xcite .",
    "this is the key observation we shall utilize next .",
    "the difference in terms of stability between future and past stems from the fact that any perturbation of a microstate will tend to make it more typical of its macrostate and thus small perturbations will not interfere with ( forward in time ) typical evolution . backwards in time , however , the microstate will propagate towards a smaller phase space volume which is untypical of the macrostate .",
    "this difference in lyapunov stability was rigorously quantified , e.g. in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will formally treat a universe parallel to ours , having at present time a similar macrostate or even the same macrostate , yet with a slightly different microstate as a perturbation .",
    "then we will try to apply the above reasoning .",
    "in what follows we quantify some microscopic and macroscopic properties of the quilted multiverse .",
    "we expect the upper bound on the number of parallel universes in the quilted multiverse to be a function of some distance measure @xmath3 , which quantifies the differences between a pair of universes described by their microstates @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath3 is small we naturally expect the upper bound on the number of parallel universes to decrease because then there are fewer pairs of universes that satisfy @xmath5 for some small @xmath6 .",
    "the upper bound will be denoted by @xmath7 the value of @xmath8 is the number of all the microstates that satisfy @xmath9 therefore , @xmath8 is simply the sum of all indicator functions of the condition @xmath10 for each pair of indices @xmath11 thus @xmath8 can be written explicitly as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the indicator function .",
    "suppose we have three universes , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , such that they have the same bound on the differences  between their states , that is@xmath16    let us now assume that the space in each universe is separated into @xmath17 three - dimensional  volumes ( e.g. cubes ) , each described by some macroscopic parameter .",
    "we shall assume for concreteness that this parameter is entropy , i.e. entropies @xmath18 @xmath19 are assigned to these volumes .",
    "then , for the @xmath20 universe , we have the following set of entropies : @xmath21 we now wish to find the variation of the entropies between the pair of universes @xmath22 and @xmath23 to obtain this goal , let us now present two different approaches:1 ) we simply calculate the covariance of the entropies , and then compare these measures .",
    "we compute the covariances @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 now , in the case that the absolute value of the covariance @xmath27 is less than @xmath28  i.e.@xmath29 we say that universe @xmath30 is closer to universe @xmath31 than to universe @xmath32    \\2 ) we take into account the `` extreme variation '' between the entropy values of the universes .",
    "suppose that the maximum difference between universes  @xmath22 is greater than the distance between universes @xmath33 i.e.,@xmath34}{\\sup}\\left (   \\left\\vert s_{k}^{j}-s_{k}^{j}\\right\\vert \\right )   < \\underset{k\\in\\lbrack1,n]}{\\sup}\\left (   \\left\\vert s_{k}^{i}-s_{k}^{m}\\right\\vert \\right )   .\\ ] ] then we say that universes @xmath35 are closer than universes @xmath23",
    "before we claim that the quilted multiverse is inconsistent with the instability of entropy decrease discussed in sec .",
    "[ arrow_of_time ] , let us define some mathematical symbols which will be useful later on .",
    "first , suppose that we have an infinite number of universes , denoted by@xmath36 where each universe @xmath37 has the microstate @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the cosmological time .",
    "further , let us define a distance measure @xmath3 , which quantifies the difference between each microstate of the @xmath40th universe , @xmath41 and another state of the @xmath42th universe , @xmath43 at some time @xmath44@xmath45 for @xmath46 . according to this definition and the definition of the quilted multiverse , for every @xmath47 there exist at least two universes such that@xmath48 where @xmath49 $ ] is some long time interval comparable with the age of the universe .",
    "now , from the definition of the quilted multiverse , we know that every possible event will occur an infinite number of times .",
    "therefore , this model suggests that there exists a set @xmath50 containing all the possible pairs @xmath51 such that@xmath52 where @xmath53 , while the latter is the set of all possible pairs from the infinite set of universes ( [ u111 ] ) .",
    "we now show that ( [ w111 ] ) is not consistent with thermodynamic arrow of time defined in sec .",
    "[ arrow_of_time ] .",
    "first , notice that if we have a thermodynamic system @xmath54 with the quantum state @xmath55 at the cosmological time @xmath56 , there exist more than one possible quantum state @xmath57 that will produce @xmath58 in time @xmath59 i.e. there is no one - to - one correspondence between the previous state of the universe and the present one .",
    "in fact , there is a very large number of possible states .",
    "therefore , the backwards evolution in time ( presumably dictated by the same dynamical rules ) of two very close universes at present will result in two very far universes at the past ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) , thus negating ( [ w111 ] ) .",
    "there is only a negligibly small probability that two close universes at present , will evolve backwards in time to two close universes in the past .",
    "this can be stated mathematically as follows :    if@xmath60 then , it is not true in general that @xmath61 for an arbitrary @xmath62 hence , the claim that many universes approximately share both our present and past ( see @xcite for instance ) , is not consistent with our notion of a thermodynamic arrow of time .",
    "this is an outcome of the following fundamental fact discussed in sec .",
    "[ arrow_of_time ] : the time direction in which entropy grows is stable against minor changes at a given @xmath56 , while the opposite direction is highly unstable .    furthermore , the entropy corresponding to our universe at present time is most likely to be the minimal one ; it will grow in both directions of time , allowing @xmath3 to be small only for very short time intervals .",
    "it could have been interesting to apply the above considerations to other kinds of multiverses .",
    "however , when the values of physical constants , and moreover , physical laws themselves , become different from those we know , the distance between our universe and others might be very large at present and hence stability is not expected to play a major role . on the other side of the scale ,",
    "there is the many worlds interpretation ( also known as the quantum multiverse ) , but for overcoming the conceptual difficulties appearing in it we refer the reader to other considerations appearing elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the number of possible universes can be represented by the boltzmann relation between entropy @xmath63 and the set @xmath64 of possible microstates corresponding to the same macrostate , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the boltzmann constant .    then , given the entropy of the i - th universe , @xmath67 @xmath68 is@xmath69 assuming that during its 13.8 billion years of history the universe has reached a very large entropy @xmath70 , we have a huge set of possible microstates @xmath71 let us examine a pair of universes having at @xmath56 close states , i.e. @xmath72 , where @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we claim that at arbitrary time @xmath76 they will most likely have @xmath77 , and the probability that @xmath78 will be close to zero .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath79 is now the backward - in - time evolution of @xmath80 , @xmath81 which is a set with very large number of possibilities , so that the probability @xmath82 will be zero .",
    "another way to see this inconsistency is to consider the point of minimal entropy during the lifetime of our universe . when picking at random another hypothetical universe having at present the same macrostate as our universe , it is most likely to have its minimal entropy at some other time other than ours ( most likely after ours )",
    ". hence , the histories of the two universes can not be the same , unless we focus at present only on the zero measure of macrostates having their minimal entropy at exactly the same time as ours .",
    "we shall try to approach the problem from a different perspective now , beginning with some qualitative considerations .",
    "one should note two extreme distance scales .",
    "when two universes are exponentially close at some point in time , they may evolve backwards to exponentially close initial states , thereby creating no inconsistency . on the other hand , if two universes are far apart right now , stability ( which corresponds to small perturbation ) again plays no role . between these two contingent cases ,",
    "lie the problematic distances to which instability considerations can be applied .",
    "this may pose a constraint on the distribution of universes within a multiverse - there might be many universes which are very far from each other , and many universes which are extremely close , but we do not expect too many universes to be intermediately close when we demand consistency over time .",
    "let us examine now a @xmath83-dimensional phase space , with some distance measure @xmath84 .",
    "let us suppose for simplicity that the phase space is discrete and focus on some large yet finite part of it .",
    "we can therefore think about this sector as a hypercube with a fine grid .",
    "a universe @xmath30 within this sector is represented at any moment as a point @xmath85 on the grid , where @xmath86/@xmath87 encapsulates the three position / momentum vectors , respectively , of each particle in this universe .",
    "we now start to gradually fill the hypercube with more and more points .",
    "we start by locating the points far away from each other , and thus the universes are very different . at some stage of this process , we will have to put the points closer to each other , a distance @xmath88 apart .",
    "we thus unavoidably created at least two universes that are too close to each other .",
    "too close , in the sense that one can be thought of as a small perturbation to the other , and then upon backward evolution in time , they would reach inconsistent states . to resolve this inconsistency",
    "we must pose a condition on the possible distance between the universes , and eventually on their density . in the case",
    "that@xmath89 for some large value of @xmath90 we find a consistent multiverse that does not violate the thermodynamical stability .",
    "of course , this multiverse is different than the quilted multiverse , and hence we call it the modified quilted multiverse . as opposed to the ordinary quilted multiverse , it might coexist with thermodynamic laws .",
    "we now apply similar arguments to those appearing at the end of the previous section . as @xmath91 @xmath92 are very large sets , the upper bound on the number of consistent parallel universes tends asymptotically to zero as @xmath93 tends to infinity , i.e.@xmath94 as happens with any discrete probability distribution approaching the continuum limit .",
    "multiverse theory has various models that describe different structures of the physical reality .",
    "one of these models is the quilted multiverse , which postulates that every possible event is occurring infinitely many times in nature , thus there are infinitely many universes resembling ours . at first glance",
    ", this model seems to be self - consistent .",
    "however , we have shown that this model negates basic thermodynamic principles .",
    "the difference between microstates in two close  universes can not be @xmath95 small at each point in time , or even along a finite , sufficiently large time interval .",
    "therefore , any possible type of multiverse would better not assume such a relation between two universes .",
    "moreover , every universe must have its unique past and future in the sense that there is no other universe with the same , or even very close , state over a substantial part of its life time .",
    "we therefore have to limit ourselves only to those universes whose macrostates at present time evolve backwards to the same point in time of minimal entropy such as ours .",
    "these obviously reside in an exponentially small fraction of phase space and may evolve in a consistent way .",
