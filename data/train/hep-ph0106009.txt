    "the last several years have been marked by the start of full scale data taking of large neutrino and muon telescopes located at lake baikal ( nt-200 ) and in deep polar ice ( amanda ) .",
    "two underwater telescopes antares and nestor assuming installation at greater depths are being intensively constructed in the mediterranean .",
    "the possibility of deployment of telescopes with huge detecting volumes up to 1 km@xmath0 is also under wide investigation .",
    "so , the knowledge of expected angular distribution of integral flux of atmospheric muons deep underwater is of interest not only for cosmic ray physics but also for the estimation of the possible background for neutrino detection and at last for a test of the correctness of underwater telescope data interpretation by using the natural flux of atmospheric muons as calibration source .",
    "the last item frequently implies the estimation with an appropriate accuracy ( e.g. , better than 5@xmath1 for a given sea level spectrum ) the underwater integral muon flux for various sets of depths , cut - off energies and angular bins especially for telescopes of big spacial dimensions .    up to now the presentation of the results of calculations of muon propagation through thick layers of water",
    "both for parent muon sea level spectra ( especially for angular dependence taking into account the sphericity of atmosphere ) and for underwater angular flux has not been quite convenient when applied to concrete underwater arrays .",
    "in addition , a part of numerical results is available only in data tables ( often insufficient for accurate interpolation ) and figures .",
    "the possibility of direct implementation of monte carlo methods depends on the availability of corresponding codes and usually assumes rather long computations and accurate choice of the grid for simulation parameters to avoid big systematic errors .",
    "therefore , there remains the necessity of analytical expressions for underwater muon integral flux .",
    "in addition , the possibility of reconstructing the parameters of a sea level spectrum by fitting measured underwater flux in the case of their direct relation looks rather attractive . in this paper",
    "we present rather simple method allowing one to analytically calculate the angular distribution of integral muon flux deep under water for cut off energies ( 1@xmath2gev and slant depths of ( 116)@xmath3 km for conventional ( @xmath4 ) sea level atmospheric muon spectra fitted by means of five parameters .",
    "the fluctuations of muon energy losses are taken into account .",
    "according to the approach of work  @xcite the analytical expression for calculations of underwater angular integral flux above cut - off energy @xmath5 for a slant depth @xmath6 seen at vertical depth @xmath7 at zenith angle @xmath8 and allowing for the fluctuations of energy loss is based on the relation @xmath9 where correction factor @xmath10 is expressed , by definition , by the ratio of theoretical integral flux calculated in the continuous loss approximation to that calculated by exact monte carlo .",
    "the analytical parametrization for @xmath10 is presented in refs .",
    "the dependencies of the correction factor on @xmath5 and @xmath11 , calculated for any reasonable sea level spectrum represent the set of rather smooth curves .",
    "the angular flux @xmath12 based on effective linear continuous energy losses @xmath13 having 2 slopes , is calculated by the following rule : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the energy in the point of slope change from @xmath16 to @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the muon path from the energy @xmath15 till @xmath5 which is given by @xmath19    the formula for integral muon angular flux in the assumption of linear continuous energy losses is as follows : @xmath20 where subscript @xmath21 stands over both pion ( @xmath22 ) and kaon ( @xmath23 ) terms and @xmath24    when using expression  ( [ ad3 ] ) for slant depths @xmath25 one must substitute @xmath26 and @xmath27 and use the values ( @xmath28 ) for a loss description . for slant depths",
    "@xmath29 the use of   ( [ ad3 ] ) remains unchangeable and the loss values are expressed by ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "this algorithm may be extended to computations with any number of slopes of the energy losses .",
    "the 5 parameters ( @xmath31 ) are those of the differential sea level muon spectrum , for which we use the following parametrization : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a spectral index and @xmath34 have approximate sense of critical energies of pions and kaons for given zenith angle and @xmath35 are those for vertical direction .",
    "the corresponding angular distrubution should be introduced using an analytical description of effective cosine @xmath36 taking into account the sphericity of atmosphere .",
    "it should be noted that the description of underwater angular flux with the 5 parameters of a sea level spectrum gives the possibility of their direct best fit by using the experimental underwater distribution .",
    "flux value in  ( [ ad3 ] ) is expressed in units of ( @xmath37s@xmath38sr@xmath38 ) and all energies are in ( gev ) , slant depth @xmath11 in units of ( g@xmath3@xmath37 ) , loss terms @xmath39 and @xmath40 in units of @xmath41gev@xmath42g@xmath43 and @xmath44 , correspondingly .    : 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 10 , and 20 , from bottom to top .",

    "[ fig : seal],width=313 ]    for the description of effective linear continuous energy losses we use the following values of parameters when substituting in  ( [ ad2 ] ) : ( @xmath46=2.67 , @xmath47=3.40 ) and ( @xmath48=@xmath496.5 , @xmath50=3.66 ) with @xmath15=35.3 tev .    to examine the angular behaviour of a flux given by the formula  ( [ ad1 ] ) by means of the comparison with numerical calculations we used the following parameters of the sea level muon spectrum : @xmath51 these values",
    "have been chosen according to splines computed in this work via the data tables kindly given us by authors of ref .",
    "when checking the values of fit spectrum for @xmath52=(0.051.0 ) we realized that the standard description of effective cosine ( with geometry of spherical atmosphere and with definite value of effective height of muon generation ) is not enough and one should introduce an additional correction @xmath53 leading to ( 1020)@xmath1 increase of effective cosine value for @xmath54  0.1 .",
    "the reason of an appearing of this correction is that the concept of an effective generation height is approximate one .",
    "it fails at large zenith angles where the real geometrical size of the generation region becomes very large .",
    "we should note that our expression  ( [ sealds1 ] ) for the sea level muon spectrum does not contain a contrubution from atmospheric prompt muons . according to the most recent calculations based on perturbative qcd ,",
    "this contribution becomes essential only at @xmath55 gev .",
    "the predictions of nonperturbative models are slightly more optimistic .",
    "we plan to generalize our approach and include this contribution in our following paper .",
    "incidentally , inclusion of prompt muons should be done in parallel with taking into account the steepening of the sea level muon spectrum due to the knee in the primary cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "the resulting fit of angular sea level spectrum in units of  ( @xmath37s@xmath38sr@xmath38ge@xmath56 ) is given by @xmath57 with modified effective cosine expressed by @xmath58 where @xmath36 is derived from spherical atmosphere geometry and is given by the polynomial fit : @xmath59 with the coefficients of the decomposition assembled in table  [ tab : ectab ] .",
    "the accuracy of  ( [ efcosfit ] ) is much better than 0.3@xmath1 except the region @xmath52=(0.30.38 ) where it may reach the value of 0.7@xmath1 .",
    "note that for @xmath60  0.4 the influence of the curvature of real atmosphere is less than 4  @xmath61 but for @xmath54  0.1 it is greater than 40  @xmath61 .",

    "the sea level spectrum given by  ( [ bkfit ] ) is valid only below the knee ( @xmath64300 tev ) of primary cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "correspondingly , for critical energies in expression ( 3 ) one should use @xmath65 instead of @xmath66 .",
    "the examination of  ( [ ad3 ] ) showed rather quick convergence of series s@xmath67 with increase of @xmath11 and @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , for the accuracy of @xmath68 computation better than 0.1  @xmath61 it is quite enough to take only four first terms of this series ( up to @xmath69 ) for all values @xmath70  1 km and @xmath5 in ( 110@xmath71 ) gev . even using the two terms",
