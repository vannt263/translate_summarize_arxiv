    "turbulence in three - dimensional ( 3d ) classical fluids is associated with a cascade of energy from large length scales defined by the details of an energy - forcing mechanism , to small length scales where viscous damping removes kinetic energy from the fluid .",
    "this range of length scales , and the range of associated wavenumbers @xmath1 , define the _ inertial range _ of energy flux  @xcite .",
    "as shown by kolmogorov in 1941  @xcite , the energy cascade corresponds to a kinetic energy spectrum that is proportional to @xmath6 in the inertial range .",
    "turbulence in a 3d fluid is also often associated with the decay of large patches of vorticity into ever smaller regions of vorticity ; this _ richardson cascade _ of vorticity provides an important visual picture of the fluid dynamics involved in 3d turbulence  @xcite .",

    "_ @xcite of a 2d fluid is conserved in addition to the fluid s kinetic energy  @xcite .",
    "the fluid dynamics during forced 2d turbulence are highly distinctive when compared with 3d flows : rather than decaying into smaller patches , vorticity aggregates into larger coherent rotating structures  @xcite ( see @xcite for a more detailed picture in terms of turbulent stress imposed on small - scale vortices ) . accompanying these 2d fluid dynamics is an _",
    "inverse _ energy cascade in which energy moves from a small forcing scale to progressively larger length scales , defining an inertial range for energy transport with energy flux in a direction opposite that of 3d turbulence .",
    "eventually , energy is transported into flows characterized by length scales that are on the order the system size  @xcite , for which dissipation may occur .",
    "additionally , there is an enstrophy cascade , in which enstrophy is transported from the forcing scale to progressively smaller scales  @xcite .",

    "such a model was used by onsager to first predict the aggregation of vortices within inviscid 2d fluids , and was the context for his prediction of the quantization of vortex circulation in a superfluid  @xcite . despite the historical importance of this approach in stimulating advances in 2d classical turbulence @xcite , characteristics of 2dqt",
    "remain little known , due in part to the difficulty of achieving the necessary 2d confinement for incompressible superfluids .",
    "the increasing relevance of 3d turbulence concepts to dilute - gas bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) experiments  @xcite and recent theoretical work on 2dqt  @xcite have highlighted the need for a treatment of turbulence in 2d superfluid systems that incorporates the concept of compressibility from the outset .",
    "motivated by recent experimental demonstrations of the confinement needed to study 2dqt in a dilute - gas becs @xcite our aim in the present paper is to present a new approach to solving some of the open problems of 2dqt in the context of such a system .    in a bec ,",
    "the vortex core size is non - negligible , and stems from the healing length @xmath0 , a scale of fundamental importance in bec dynamics that is typically about two orders of magnitude smaller than the system size  @xcite .",
    "compressibility also allows for a rich array of physical phenomena in these superfluids ; in particular , a vortex dipole @xcite ( comprised of two vortices of opposite sign of circulation ) can recombine , releasing vortex energy as a burst of acoustic waves .",
    "the opposite process of vortex dipole generation from sound may also efficiently occur .",
    "recent theoretical studies of decaying quantum turbulence in 2d becs have shown that when the vortex dipole annihilation process is dominant it sets up a direct cascade of energy over the scales associated with the dipole decay , suggesting that this annihilation mechanism could prohibit an inverse energy cascade from occurring in a compressible superfluid  @xcite .",
    "moreover , enstrophy in a quantum fluid is associated with the number of vortex cores ; if vortices annihilate , then enstrophy may not be conserved , bringing into question the existence of energy and enstrophy cascades in 2dqt , and the universal nature of 2d turbulence and its correspondence with 2dqt .",
    "the general characteristics of 2d quantum turbulence in compressible quantum fluids , including the capacity for these systems to show an inverse energy cascade , enstrophy conservation , and vortex aggregation have thus remained largely unknown .",
    "however , a recent study of the formation of vortex dipoles during the breakdown of superfluid flow around an obstacle in a highly oblate bec experimentally and numerically observed aggregation of like - sign vortices into larger - scale coherent structures  @xcite , and found time scales over which vortex number and hence enstrophy may remain constant .",
    "the vortex _ clustering _ effect inhibits the dipole - decay mechanism by keeping vortices distant from antivortices ( vortices of opposite circulation ) , and suggests that an inverse cascade might be observed under the right conditions of forcing .",
    "system dynamics consistent with the existence of an inverse energy cascade were indeed found in a recent study of forced 2dqt in a bec @xcite .    in this article",
    "we address 2d quantum turbulence in a compressible quantum fluid from an analytical perspective .",
    "we determine the kinetic energy spectra of vortex distributions in a homogeneous compressible superfluid in a quasi - exact manner via an analytical treatment of the physics of the vortex core .",
    "we are thus able to study the properties of vortex configurations and their resulting spectra in bec .",
    "we develop a technique to sample spatially localized vortex distributions with power - law behavior over a well defined scale range .",
    "we are thus able to identify the conditions for an inertial range in fully polarized and neutral systems .",
    "a polarized cluster is sampled using a specific exponent for the vortex locations relative to the cluster center , which is size and scale dependent .",
    "the specific radial exponent is shown to determine the velocity distribution in the classical limit and we thus identify an expanding inertial range with a steepening velocity distribution .    making use of the universality of the spectral region generated by the vortex core , we identify an analytical form of the kolmogorov constant that we test against dynamical simulations of the damped gpe . the derivation of the kolmogorov constant occurs for a highly idealized vortex distribution .",
    "thus the complex flows generated by real forcing require that we introduce a new parameter called the _ clustered fraction _ , and modify our ansatz to account for imperfect clustering , based on the universality of the kolmogorov constant .",
    "the modified ansatz agrees well with the numerical simulations of grid turbulence , supporting our analytical identification of the kolmogorov constant .",

    "it is important to note that the condition of continuity at @xmath141 is no longer exactly met , since only the value @xmath375 will produce an infrared spectrum with @xmath6 that is continuous with the ultraviolet power law approximation at @xmath246 .",
    "we also note that a more general measure of clustering , namely the _ polarization index _ ( @xmath376 )",
    "was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite measuring the degree and type of spatial clustering of like - sign vortices in 3dct .",
    "the kolmogorov @xmath6 spectrum was found to correspond to the partially polarized value @xmath377 , while other scaling laws yield differing polarizations .",
    "the clustered fraction used in the present work is a simpler ( global ) measure of polarization as it does not contain information about the spatial distribution of vortices , but it is only relevant for 2dqt .    we can also write down an expression for @xmath361 for a general energy spectrum that may be computed numerically from simulation data , by making use of the ansatz ( [ irgen ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to using ( [ kolmogstan ] ) with @xmath373 , from which we can define the function @xmath378 in a region where the spectrum is approximately @xmath6 , @xmath379 will be approximately constant , and it may be compared with the prediction ( [ ck ] ) .",
    "we test this numerically in the next section .",
    "we note that in 3dqt an energy bottleneck has been predicted for the direct energy cascade  @xcite , and also observed in gpe simulations  @xcite .",
    "it occurs due a mismatch between the rates of energy transport at large length scales ( hydrodynamic regime ) and small length scales ( kelvin wave cascade ) .",
    "the mismatch causes energy to pile up at the length scale where the two cascades meet .",
    "this raises the possibility of a bottleneck in 2d , although kelvin waves are disallowed in 2dqt , so this particular mechanism would not be relevant . however , for a given forcing mechanism",
    ", it is possible that the rate of transporting energy to large length scales may not be high enough to remove all of the vortex energy introduced at the forcing scale .",
    "thus a bottleneck could still occur , and our assumption of continuity of the spectrum at @xmath380 may not hold in general .",
    "we return to this question in the next subsection , where we find some indication of an energy bottleneck at the forcing scale in numerical simulations .",
    "we now consider a simulation of the forced dgpe that generates significant clustering of vortices of the same sign .",
    "the system consists of a homogeneous superfluid with periodic boundary conditions , stirred by dragging four gaussian obstacle beams through it at a constant speed  @xcite , thus modeling grid turbulence in a bec .",
    "when an obstacle is dragged through a superfluid sufficiently rapidly , superfluidity can not be maintained .",
    "for slowly moving obstacles , the superfluid will adapt to the forcing , and vortices are not formed . above a critical velocity @xmath381  @xcite vortex dipoles",
    "are periodically formed in the wake of the obstacle , injecting linear momentum into the superfluid .",
    "sufficiently rapid motion ( @xmath382 ) causes many vortices to be nucleated behind the obstacles in a chaotic fashion  @xcite , involving clustering of like sign vortices .",
    "our choice of obstacle speed puts the system dynamics in the latter category .",
    "we work in units of @xmath11 , @xmath0 , and @xmath383 for energy , length , and time , respectively . in these units",
    "the specific parameters we choose ( see the previous subsection ) are @xmath384 , corresponding to homogeneous density @xmath385 , and @xmath386 particles in a homogeneous 2d system of side length @xmath387 .",
    "the gaussian potentials each have fixed @xmath388 width of @xmath389 , and height @xmath390 , and are initially located at @xmath391 , @xmath392 , @xmath393 .",
    "numerically , we proceed by first finding a ground state of ( [ eom ] ) , for a homogeneous system with periodic boundary conditions , subject to the localized obstacle beams",
    ". we then transform into a frame translating at @xmath394 , and maintain the obstacle locations relative to this frame , creating a dragging grid of stirring beams .",
    "a small amount of initial noise is added to the wave function to break the reflection symmetries of the system .",
    "we thus evolve the system according to ( [ eom ] ) for the same potential , but with the galilean transformed nonlinear operator @xmath395 . during evolution",
    "the dimensionless damping rate is set to @xmath396 .",
    "the time evolution of the system is shown in figure [ timeseq ] at three times , at approximately @xmath397 , so as to avoid any periodic flow effects in the @xmath194-direction .",
    "the four obstacle beams generate many vortices ( up to @xmath398 ) , and significant clustering ( @xmath399 ) .",
    "the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum shows a wide region that is well described by the @xmath6 form of equation ( [ irgen ] ) .",
    "for later times [ figure [ timeseq ] ( b ) , ( c ) ] the spectrum shows a significant pile up around the forcing scale @xmath238 , suggesting a mismatch between the rates of injection and transport of incompressible kinetic energy .    in figure [ ckfig ]",
    "we compare the function @xmath400 [ eq .",
    "( [ k41 ] ) ] , as numerically computed from our simulation data , with the analytical prediction of the kolmogorov constant @xmath361 [ eq .  ( [ cklength ] ) ] .",
    "the region of @xmath6 appears as a broad flat region that is in close agreement with @xmath401 pertaining to our simulation parameters .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated relationships between the concepts of 2d turbulence in classical fluids and the emerging topic of 2d quantum turbulence of vortices , specifically as it relates to bose - einstein condensates .",
    "we established a link between the hydrodynamic limit of the damped gpe and the navier - stokes equations , providing an estimate of a quantum reynolds number for superfluid flows in becs .",
    "we have given a theoretical treatment of the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum that explicitly incorporates the vortex core structure in a compressible superfluid .",
    "the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum for a compressible superfluid is deconstructed in terms of single - vortex contributions determining a unique ultraviolet power - law where the energy spectrum scales as @xmath3 , and a contribution that depends on the configuration of vortices within the fluid that determines the infrared region of the spectrum . for the configurational regime",
    "we find :    1 .",
    "the spectrum only depends on the distribution of vortex separations and the sign of the circulation of each quantum vortex .",
    "if the distribution of vortex separation @xmath18 for a system of vortices of the _ same sign _ is a power - law @xmath402 with exponent @xmath370 , the kinetic energy spectrum will take the universal kolmogorov form @xmath403 , as shown for point vortices  @xcite .",
    "_ localized _ clusters of @xmath206 vortices of the same circulation with this power law distribution can be constructed by sampling using a specific radial exponent @xmath271 that depends on the number of vortices and the scale range over which they are distributed .",
    "2 .   the azimuthal velocity field of a large cluster",
    "is determined by @xmath297 . by inflating the scale range of a cluster",
    "we find that @xmath297 increases , the velocity field is steepened and the inertial range expands to larger scales . in a neutral system the inertial range can be extended by increasing the size of clusters while decreasing their number .",
    "the universal form of the uv region of the kinetic energy spectrum imposes a strong constraint .",
    "if the kolmogorov power law occurs in the infrared region , then the postulate of continuity between the infrared and ultraviolet regions completely determines the spectrum when the ultraviolet and infrared regions are approximated as power laws .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the inertial range extending down to the smallest configurational scale of the system @xmath404 .",
    "we note that the postulate of continuity may not be relevant for all systems or forcing mechanisms .",
    "we infer an analytical value for the kolmogorov constant [ eq .",
    "( [ ck ] ) ] under the conditions of spectral continuity at the cross - over scale for a system of vortices of the same sign . to assess the validity of this inference for dynamical situations we compare our analytical results with spectra from a numerical simulation of the forced dgpe for the specific case of a dragging a grid of obstacles through an otherwise homogeneous bec .",
    "we find reasonable agreement provided we introduce the concept of a _ clustered fraction _",
    "@xmath405 , which is the fraction of vortices that have same - sign nearest neighbors .",
    "this measure discounts all vortex dipoles from the configurational analysis .",
    "we then observe good agreement between our kolmogorov ansatz [ eq .  ( [ irgen ] ) ] , and the spectrum calculated from the dgpe data .",
    "we also find that the predicted value of the kolmogorov constant is in close agreement with the numerical simulations [ figure [ ckfig ] ] .",
    "we note that while our analysis indicates that vortex positions and circulations are enough to determine an approximate incompressible kinetic energy spectrum , the reverse is not necessarily true : a kolmogorov spectrum does not carry information about specific vortex distributions .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis does indicate that the number of vortices in a quantum fluid can in principle be directly determined from the ultraviolet energy spectrum .",
    "moreover , the concept of a cascade in turbulence implies system dynamics and energy transport , yet aside from our numerical simulation example , our analytical approach is an instantaneous measure .",
    "importantly , one must determine means of characterizing vortex motion and relate such dynamics to the cascade concept .",
    "the field of 2d quantum vortex turbulence is relatively new , compared with the much longer histories of 3d superfluid turbulence , 2d classical turbulence , and even dilute - gas bose - einstein condensation .",
    "point - vortex models have been extensively used in descriptions of superfluid dynamics as well as in 2d classical turbulence , although point - vortex distributions can only serve as approximate models of real 2d classical flows .",
    "our approach merges concepts from each of the above subjects in order to develop a new understanding of 2d quantum turbulence . by considering the compressibility of a dilute - gas bec",
    ", we find an analytical expression for the ultraviolet incompressible kinetic energy spectrum and an @xmath206-vortex equivalent of enstrophy in a quantum fluid , which we term the onstrophy . for the infrared region ,",
    "point vortex models are sufficient , and vortex configurations serve to identify spectra as summarized above . taken together , the primary new outcome of our analysis is a link between vortex distributions , vortex core structure , and power - law spectra for 2d compressible quantum fluids .",
    "future work on 2d quantum vortex turbulence will involve numerical simulations and comparisons with our analytical results , extension of this analysis to confined and inhomogeneous density distributions , characterization of vortex dynamics and the time - dependence of energy spectra particularly in relation to clustering  @xcite , inverse - energy cascades , and the nonthermal fixed point  @xcite , and investigation of connections with weak - wave turbulence in bec  @xcite .",
    "we also believe that observing vortex distributions such as the @xmath370 power - law for localized clusters may provide a new means of quantitatively characterizing 2d quantum vortex turbulence through direct experimental observations of vortex locations in a forced 2d superfluid , and we are working towards realizing such experimental observations .",
