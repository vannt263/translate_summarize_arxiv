    "general relativity ( gr ) has passed every test so far , from solar system dynamics and light bending to precision measurements of the orbits of binary pulsars @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , tests in strong gravity remain elusive , largely because phenomena in strong gravity involve other uncertain physics as well .",
    "for example , spectral profiles of fe  k@xmath2 fluorescence lines in active galactic nuclei and stellar - mass black holes @xcite are consistent with the expectations of gas streamlines near rapidly rotating black holes",
    ". however , precision tests are not yet possible because of unknowns about the emission profile and other complications .",
    "more robust tests are on the horizon .",
    "larger - area x - ray detectors such as _ constellation - x _ @xcite may be able to track the motion of individual emitting elements in a disk , hence mapping out the spacetime near a rotating black hole .",
    "even more robustness is likely to come from detections of gravitational waves from double black hole mergers of various masses and mass ratios seen with ground - based interferometers such as ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , geo-600 @xcite , and tama @xcite and later with space - based instruments such as lisa @xcite .",
    "a third source of strong field tests could exploit neutron star masses and surface redshifts .",
    "it is that sort of system that is the subject of this paper .",
    "it is therefore desirable for current and future data to have theoretically sound  and preferably well - motivated  alternatives to or generalizations of gr .",
    "the simplest alternatives that have been considered are various scalar - tensor theories . in the case of the well - known jordan - brans - dicke theory",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the predictions of the theory in both the weak and strong field regimes deviate from gr by a parameter that is tightly constrained by post - newtonian solar system experiments .",
    "thus , the properties of compact objects such as neutron stars in jordan - brans - dicke theories that pass these weak field tests must be very close to those found in gr .",
    "however , damour and esposito - farese @xcite found a wide class of other scalar - tensor theories exhibiting  spontaneous scalarization , \" where weak field constraints are met , but compact objects have significant deviations from gr in the strong field regime .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the properties of non - rotating neutron stars in these theories , finding larger stellar masses than in gr and larger surface redshifts for a given equation of state .",
    "these results were then used to put an observational constraint on one of the parameters of the model .    over the past several years",
    ", a number of further alternatives to gr have been proposed in the context of incorporating lorentz violation ( lv ) into gravity ; see for example refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "these theories can be thought of as low energy effective field theory descriptions of local lorentz violation ( lv ) possibly arising from quantum gravitational physics at energies near the planck scale . in this paper",
    "we study one of these models ,  einstein - aether \" theory ( or  ae - theory \" for short ) @xcite , in which a dynamical unit timelike vector field @xmath3 is coupled to gravity .",
    "the lv here is a sort of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the action is lorentz invariant , but in any solution defines the 4-velocity of a local  preferred \" frame at each spacetime point , which breaks local boost symmetry .",
    "the general ae - theory dynamics is dependent on four dimensionless coupling parameters .",
    "weak field constraints on ae - theory can all be met by restricting these parameters to a subset of the four dimensional parameter space that is very narrow compared to unity in all but one dimension .",
    "the nature of these constraints is summarized in the following section .",
    "they are derived in the weak field regime , except for strongly self - gravitating neutron star binaries .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask what are the deviations from general relativity in the strong field regime , and to compare that behavior with observations of astrophysical systems .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to study the properties of non - rotating neutron stars in ae - theory .",
    "the stellar solutions depend on only one combination of the theory s coupling parameters .",
    "we consider six candidate equations of state , three with purely nucleonic degrees of freedom and different hardness , and three involving quark matter with different bag constants . by numerical solution of the field equations interior to the star",
    "we obtain the maximum mass , relation between mass and radius , and surface redshifts , all as a function of the coupling parameter .",
    "it turns out that the maximum neutron star mass is less than in the case of gr , and is smaller for larger values of the coupling parameter .",
    "thus , once the equation of state becomes known well enough , it will be possible to place an upper bound on the coupling parameter by observations of neutron star masses .",
    "nonstandard relations between mass and surface redshift also occur , providing another possibility for interesting phenomenology and constraining the coupling parameter .",
    "we also examine the location of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) as a function of mass , to determine whether that might provide further useful observables distinguishing gr and ae - theory .",
    "we find however that the isco is nearly unchanged for reasonable coupling parameters and non - spinning objects .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we first review the basics of einstein - aether theory and summarize the current constraints on theory . in section",
    "iii the equations of structure for fluid stars in ae - theory are presented , together with the form of the analytic exterior solution to which the interior must be matched . using the exterior solution ,",
    "expressions are obtained for the surface redshift and isco radius that can be employed with the numerical solutions to obtain the observable quantities .",
    "we present the numerical results in section iv , together with the constraints on the coupling parameter that can be obtained with these results . in section",
    "v we conclude with a brief discussion of prospects for further constraints from more precise neutron star measurements and rotating black hole solutions .",

    "the convention used here for metric signature is @xmath10 and the units are chosen so that the speed of light defined by the metric @xmath4 is unity .",
    "note that since the covariant derivative operator @xmath11 involves derivatives of the metric through the connection components , and since the unit vector is nowhere vanishing , the terms quadratic in @xmath12 also modify the kinetic terms for the metric .",

    "this condition is satisfied entirely in the region allowed by ( [ superluminal ] ) .",
    "curve does not fall entirely in the otherwise allowed region , but this is due to an error in the analysis there that has since been corrected  @xcite .",
    "] however , the neutron star sources are strongly self - gravitating .",
    "it turns out  @xcite that as long as @xmath28 , the strong field corrections are negligible , but for larger coupling values the precise radiation damping constraints are not yet worked out .",
    "they will lead to a modified condition @xmath29 that will depend on the nature of the compact objects in the binary .",

    "time independent spherically symmetric solutions in ae - theory were extensively studied recently in a pair of papers on fluid star  @xcite and black hole  @xcite configurations . for black holes , the aether vector has a radial component , but for the case of a star it does not , i.e. it is aligned with the static frame defined by the killing vector , both inside and outside the star .",
    "thus , unlike in gr , the exterior solution for a star is not the same as for a black hole .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the static vacuum exterior solution was found analytically , and numerical integration was employed to find interior stellar solutions for the test case of a constant mass density equation of state .",
    "the mass was found by matching the interior to the exterior solutions . unlike constant density stars in general relativity ( gr )",
    ", the mass does not increase monotonically with central pressure ; rather , there is a maximum mass at a finite central pressure beyond which the stars are unstable .",
    "this maximum mass is smaller than in the gr case .",
    "it is adequate for our present purposes to restrict attention to non - rotating stars , since the effect of rotation on the maximum mass , surface redshift , and isco is very small for the observationally relevant spins .",
    "for example , presuming the fractional change in maximum mass scales with the square of the spin , tables 4 and 5 in ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that even for a one millisecond period the increase of maximum mass is less than 5% in gr . barring an unexpected much greater sensitivity to a small spin in ae - theory",
    ", the results we find here for non - rotating stars should be quite reliable except for the fastest spinning stars .",
    "the static , spherically symmetric form for the metric and aether can be written in schwarzschild - like coordinates as ds^2 & = & e^a(r ) dt^2 - b(r ) dr^2 - r^2 d^2,[metricansatz ] + u & = & e^-a(r)/2  _ t. [ aetheransatz ] note that since the aether is aligned with the timelike killing vector it is completely determined by the metric . in particular , the aether is at rest with respect to the static frame at infinity , which means that the star is taken to be at rest with respect to the aether . when comparing theory and observation , it is typically assumed that the background aether frame coincides with that of the cosmological fluid .",
    "any particular star will of course have some proper motion with respect to this frame , so strictly speaking the physically relevant solutions are not of the form ( [ metricansatz],[aetheransatz ] ) .",
    "however , assuming a relative velocity of order @xmath39 , this discrepancy should not be significant for comparisons of much less precision such as concern us here .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for configurations of the form ( [ metricansatz],[aetheransatz ] ) the @xmath40 and @xmath41 terms in the action ( [ action ] ) and their variations are zero , and thus they do not contribute to the field equations . also , the effect of the @xmath42 term can be absorbed by the replacement @xmath43 .",
    "hence the only coupling relevant to these solutions is @xmath44 .",
    "the fluid stress tensor appearing in the metric field equation ( [ aee ] ) is t^m_ab = ( ( r)+p(r ) ) v_a v_b - p(r ) g_ab[perffluid]where @xmath45 is the fluid 4-velocity , @xmath46 its mass density , and @xmath47 its pressure .    the metric field equation and the bianchi identity together imply that the sum of the aether and fluid energy - momentum tensors is divergenceless .",
    "in addition , since the aether does not couple directly to the fluid , its stress tensor is independently divergenceless when its field equation and unit constraint are satisfied",
    ". therefore the fluid stress tensor is also independently divergenceless in any solution .",
    "thus , an appropriate system of equations for the aether plus fluid case is the ( i ) metric field equation , ( ii ) aether field equation , ( iii ) radial component of @xmath48 , which is the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for the fluid p+a(+p ) = 0 , [ hydro ] and ( iv ) an equation of state @xmath49 .",

    "these are the three hardest equation of state models and have equilibrium configurations at this mass .",
    "( as shown in fig .  [ massconstraints ] , the other three softest equation of state models do not have equilibrium configurations at this mass . ) the surface redshifts increase by roughly 10% as @xmath31 ranges from 0 to 1 .",
    "+    if in the future surface redshifts together with masses can reliably be determined , then tight constraints on the equation of state in gr may be obtained by combining measurements for a collection of stars .",
    "it is also possible that single measurements may provide stringent constraints .",
    "for example , as revealed in fig .",
    "[ redshift ] , the proposed surface redshift 0.35 of exo  0748676  @xcite is compatible with @xmath120 only for the hardest eos ( hh ) among those we considered .",
    "in general , the parameter @xmath31 could not be constrained without separate knowledge of the equation of state . however , in the example just mentioned one could serendipitously tightly constrain both the equation of state and the value of @xmath31 , since a redshift of 0.35 is the lower limit of all the curves at this mass .",
    "we have found that the structure of non - rotating neutron stars in einstein - aether theory is fairly close to that in general relativity , but there are quantitative differences .",
    "depending on the equation of state , the maximum masses range from about 6 - 15% smaller than in gr when the ae - theory parameter @xmath31 is equal to 1 .",
    "the corresponding surface redshifts are roughly 10% larger than in gr",
    ". measurements of high gravitational masses or precise surface redshifts have the potential to yield strong joint constraints on the equation of state and on deviations from gr .",
    "therefore , as laboratory experiments and other observations narrow down the equation of state of cold matter at several times nuclear density , neutron star observations may be a valuable resource for exploring deviations from general relativity in strong gravity .",
    "we now make some comments about related further work that would be interesting to pursue .",
    "first , the neutron star solutions we considered are at rest with respect to the asymptotic aether . although corrections due to motion with respect to the aether are not significant for the present paper , they are important for the high precision predictions of radiation damping in compact binaries",
    ". in particular , the missing ingredient in the analysis of @xcite is the value of the  sensitivity \" parameter measuring the velocity dependence of the mass . it should be possible to compute this parameter for different masses and different equations of state by determining the velocity perturbations of the solutions found here , or by finding the exact nonlinear solutions with finite velocity .",
    "we considered in this paper only neutron star phenomenology .",
    "what is the situation for black holes ?",
    "it was found in @xcite that although different from stellar exteriors , nonrotating black hole solutions in ae - theory are very similar to the schwarzschild solution of gr .",
    "hence it is not likely that these could lead to significant constraints .",
    "nevertheless , it is quite conceivable that strong deviations from gr will be found for rapidly rotating black hole solutions .",
    "this is suggested by the presence of the ergoregion , in which the inertial frames are strongly dragged .",
    "the preferred frame aspects of ae - theory may be conspicuous here , due to larger gradients in the aether field .",
    "also , unlike for the spherically symmetric non - rotating case , the spin-1 degrees of freedom of the aether could be activated in the axially symmetric setting . to explore these issues would require finding numerical solutions describing rotating black holes in einstein - aether theory .",
    "we are grateful to sudip bhattacharyya for kindly providing us with tables characterizing the nuclear equations of state used in our analysis .",
