    "for a chaotic system with a normalized invariant density pesin s theorem states the identity between the sum of positive lyapunov exponents and its kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy ( see @xcite for conditions ) . in certain weakly chaotic systems ,",
    "the dynamics still remains quasi random , though the entropy and lyapunov exponents are zero @xcite .",
    "standard chaotic concepts based on exponential separation of nearby trajectories are replaced in these systems with new methods which have drawn considerable attention .",
    "previously , a generalization of pesin identity was suggested for systems whose invariant densities are not absolutely continuous along expanding directions @xcite and for systems such as logistic map at the edge of chaos based on tsallis entropy @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by a question posed by r. klages , we found a pesin - type identity in intermittent weakly chaotic maps @xcite .",
    "our work shows that krengel entropy @xcite must be used instead of ks entropy which is zero for such systems , and that infinite ergodic theory is the mathematical basis for this identity .    for weakly chaotic maps , in particular maps with",
    "marginally unstable fixed points ( see details below ) , the infinite invariant measure @xcite is an essential tool . even though this density is not normalizable , still it can be used to describe statistical properties of the dynamical system , thus replacing the usual normalizable invariant density .",
    "however , besides a few exceptions @xcite the invariant density @xmath0 is unknown . here",
    "we provide a simple numerical approach for its estimation .",
    "further , the standard scenario of statistical physics is that for chaotic motion , the density @xmath2 of ergodic systems will tend in to a normalizable invariant measure @xmath4 in the long time limit .",
    "for example @xmath5 is the boltzmann measure for canonical systems . for applicability of the statistical approach",
    "the invariant density must be reached starting from wide classes of initial conditions . for systems with an infinite invariant measure",
    "do we have similar behavior ?",
    "namely will the density approach an infinite measure starting from different types of initial conditions .",
    "here we investigate this issue numerically , and show that different initial states yield the same estimate for the infinite invariant density .",
    "this means that we have a simple method to find the infinite invariant density , at least on a computer .",
    "the numerical estimation of the infinite invariant density is important for many applications , in particular for the estimation of the krengel entropy and hence , according to our generalized pesin s identity , the averaged separation of trajectories .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that our numerical infinite invariant density is in excellent agreement with exact analytical infinite invariant density found by thaler @xcite for a specific map . using this exact analytical infinite invariant density we corroborated the validity of our generalized pesin identity without fitting .",
    "this leaves no room for speculations and doubts on our results .",
    "recently saa and venegeroles ( sv ) proposed a pesin identity for the same class of dynamics investigated in our work ( e.g. pomeau - manneville map ) for individual trajectories @xcite .",
    "we note that the average of this identity over initial conditions is exactly our previously obtained results @xcite .",
    "we remove misleading statements , for example sv claimed to have `` corrected '' our results .",
    "we clarify the notations used , and show that the core of misunderstanding is a trivial constant multiplying the infinite invariant density .",
    "this is a simple matter of definition of the infinite density which is not found for normal systems with finite invariant density since there the normalization condition determines uniquely the multiplicative constant in front of the equilibrium density .",
    "similar to our work @xcite we study one dimensional maps with one or more unstable fixed points .",
    "we consider parameter regime where the system has an infinite invariant density @xcite soon to be defined .",
    "the discrete time dynamics is governed by @xmath6 .",
    "a prominent example being the pomeau - manneville ( pm ) map @xcite @xmath7 with @xmath8 , @xmath9 . a second example studied by thaler",
    "@xcite is @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "notice that this map is asymmetric with respect to @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "the first map has one unstable fixed point on @xmath14 , while the second has two such points on @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "a third map introduced by thaler @xcite is @xmath16^{-1/(z-2 ) } \\ ; | \\ ; mod \\ ; 1 , \\ ; \\ ; z\\ge1 . \\label{thalereq}\\ ] ] this map is similar to the pm map in the sense that it has one unstable fixed point located at @xmath17 and for small @xmath18 it has @xmath19 behavior . in this case",
    "this map is important since thaler has obtained its exact analytical infinite invariant density .    for all models we are interested in @xmath21 where the usual lyapunov exponent and ks entropy are zero .",
    "when @xmath22 they are positive , the invariant measure normalizable and usual pesin identity holds . in this case the distribution of finite time lyapunov exponents provides additional information about the behavior of maps @xcite .    for a single trajectory",
    "the generalized lyapunov exponent is defined as @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 for @xmath21 while @xmath25 for @xmath22 .",
    "the generalized lyapunov exponent ( [ eq1 ] ) is a random variable even in the long time limit .",
    "therefore , averaging @xmath26 over initial conditions @xmath27 , we focused among other things on the averaged generalized lyapunov exponent @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "we defined the infinite invariant density according to @xcite ( see also appendix of @xcite for more discussion of the mathematical aspects of this definition ) @xmath30 here @xmath2 is the density of particles normalized to unity @xmath31 .",
    "we later check numerically ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) that @xmath0 is unique , in the sense that it is independent of the choice of the initial conditions .",
    "since @xmath32 conserves normalization , @xmath2 is normalized for any @xmath33 still the integral over the limiting value of @xmath0 diverges ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the conditions and rigorous proof that @xmath0 is indeed an invariant density can be found in thaler s work @xcite for a class of maps with a single unstable fixed point on the origin ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt this result and use it to find the infinite invariant density numerically .    using a simple continuous time stochastic model proposed in @xcite",
    ", we analytically find the approximation for the normalized density of the pm map ( [ maneq ] ) with one unstable fixed point @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes small @xmath36 and long time .",
    "the crossover @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 . using ( [ g_t ] ) the time dependence of the crossover",
    "is obtained @xmath39 .",
    "hence , the crossover goes to zero @xmath40 as @xmath41 . from definition ( [ eq3 ] )",
    "we obtain the approximate infinite invariant density for the pm map @xmath42 and @xmath43 according to ( [ rho1 ] ) the slow escape of trajectories from the vicinity of the unstable fixed point @xmath14 accumulates the density in its vicinity . the interesting feature being that this density diverges so strongly on @xmath44 that @xmath0 is non - normalizable .",
    "importantly thaler s theorem @xcite shows that ( [ eqsvb ] ) is valid for a large class of maps with a single unstable fixed point on the origin , and which behave like @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] demonstrates that when @xmath41 equations ( [ rho1 ] ) , ( [ eqsvb ] ) describe the infinite invariant density for pm map . for finite time @xmath33 and small @xmath47",
    "we see deviations in agreement with ( [ g_t ] ) .",
    "since our theory works for small @xmath36 , not surprisingly ( [ rho1 ] ) does not work perfectly for @xmath48 , though deviations seem small to the naked eye .",
    "for the map ( [ thalereq ] ) thaler has found an exact analytical expression for its infinite invariant density @xcite @xmath49 . \\label{thalerinf}\\ ] ] hence , unlike the pm map where we do not have an exact expression for the infinite density , for the map ( [ thalereq ] ) we can compare simulations with theory in the regime @xmath50 .",
    "since , as we mentioned for @xmath46 this map has the same behavior as the pm map , the constant @xmath51 is given by ( [ eqsvb ] ) .",
    "note that the multiplicative constant @xmath51 is related to our working definition ( [ eq3 ] ) ( see further discussion below ) .",
    "in figures [ fig2new1 ] we see that @xmath52 slowly converges towards the theoretical infinite density , besides the mentioned deviations close to @xmath53 . as we increase measurement time the domain @xmath54 , where deviations from asymptotic theory are observed is diminishing . in figure [ fig2new3 ]",
    "we plot @xmath52 divided by @xmath55 showing that it converges to the constant @xmath51 as predicted in ( [ thalerinf ] ) .",
    "this implies that our method of estimation of the infinite density works well , and hence we are confident it can be used also for maps where we do not have an exact expression for invariant density .",
    "we will use thaler s analytical expression for the invariant density ( [ thalerinf ] ) to corroborate the generalization of the pesin identity below .",
    "but first we briefly review the generalized pesin identity .     equation ( [ eq3 ] ) for the pm map with @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) and @xmath20 . in simulations",
    "the times are @xmath58 ( in figure from bottom to top ) .",

    "for @xmath74 a different behavior is found . from ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) we suggested the generalization of the pesin s identity in the form @xcite @xmath75 where the krengel entropy appears @xmath76 note",

    "operationally , however , what is our work about ?",
    "it states that starting with a reasonable initial condition , e.g. particles uniformly distributed but not a delta function initial condition , the density of particles @xmath2 evolves according to the transformation @xmath32 and in the long time limit one can deduce from @xmath2 the infinite invariant @xmath0 density using ( [ eq3 ] ) .",

    ", we can evaluate the krengel entropy by performing an integral .",
    "this entropy is then used to evaluate the average separation .",
    "of course our theory is testable in the sense that one can evaluate the infinite invariant density and with it predict the average separation , namely follow two different numerical protocols and checking the validity of our results ( see below ) .",

    "one may claim that instead of using the definition ( [ eq3 ] ) for the infinite invariant density one could have used another definition .",
    "one may suggest @xmath104 with some @xmath105 . in our work",
    "we choose @xmath106 , which is consistent with the usual choice of the normalized invariant density ( the case @xmath25 ) @xmath107 the essence of the criticism on our work by sv @xcite is that we could have chosen a different @xmath108 .",
    "however that would amount with only trivial multiplication of our final results with a constant .",
    "our results are valid as long as one pays attention to our definitions , in particular one should not ignore equation ( [ eq3 ] ) . by not informing their reader that we use equation ( [ eq3 ] ) ,",
    "sv have distorted the context of our work .",
    "clearly , as we discussed above , our generalized pesin identity depends also on the definition of the generalized lyapunov exponent ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "similarly to the infinite invariant density it can be defined with some constant which we choose to be unity . however , as it follows from the derivation after ( [ eq5 ] ) , ( [ eq6 ] ) choosing another constant in the definition of the generalized lyapunov exponent would result in multiplication of our generalized pesin identity by a trivial constant .",
    "the definition of these constants become important when considering averages . for example",
    "the generalized lyapunov exponent converges to a constant @xmath109 because the left - hand side does not depend on the choice of an invariant density , namely it can not depend on an arbitrary multiplicative constant , the infinite density @xmath0 must be determined precisely . indeed exactly for this reason we must have @xmath106 , and the working definition ( [ eq3 ] ) should not be ignored .",
    "one could of - course absorb the @xmath89 in ( [ l2 ] ) in the definition of @xmath0 , but as mentioned this is a matter of choice , which does not influence the predictive power of the theory .    in their equation",
    "( 16 ) sv claim to correct our result ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "this boils down to other choices of @xmath108 and hence in our opinion is not a correction at all . in their work",
    "sv use an infinite invariant measure for the pm map @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is an undefined constant ( see their equation ( 2 ) and compare in our notations to @xmath0 equations ( [ rho1 ] ) , ( [ eqsvb ] ) ) . since they do not fix the constant @xmath111",
    "this measure is not the same as ours ( freedom in choice of multiplicative constant @xmath108 ) .",
    "their pesin - type identity reads @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the krengel entropy , with respect to invariant measure @xmath114 .",
    "notice , that by fixing the constant @xmath111 as in our equation ( [ eqsvb ] ) , sv relation ( [ eqsv ] ) boils down to our generalized pesin identity ( [ eq5 ] ) . also notice that sv presentation is specific to the pm map which has one unstable fixed point .",
    "of course more generally we can have two or more unstable fixed points .",
    "the invariant density will reveal singularities next to @xmath115 unstable fixed points all with the same order of singularities ( i.e. the same @xmath96 ) located on @xmath116 with @xmath117 @xcite . for example @xmath118 and @xmath119 for the map ( [ man2 ] ) .",
    "then the infinite invariant density will be of the type @xmath120 moreover , for @xmath13 the map ( [ man2 ] ) is asymmetric with respect to @xmath12 , therefor the infinite invariant density is also asymmetric as shown in figure [ fig1a ] and @xmath121 .",
    "the identity suggested by sv does not describe this situation since it is restricted to a single unstable fixed point @xmath122 and hence is not general .",
    "in contrast , our pesin - type identity is general and valid for maps with any number of unstable fixed points .",
    "so , we suggest to stick with our original identity ( [ eq5 ] ) , which is general and at the same time not distort its meaning by ignoring equation ( [ eq3 ] ) .     equation ( [ eq3 ] ) for the map ( [ man2 ] ) with @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) calculated at @xmath126 ( dashed line ) , @xmath80 ( solid line ) with uniform initial density @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",

    "they write : _ a closer inspection of our work ( see in particular , their eq .  ( 10 ) ) shows that they , when dealing with the continuous time stochastic linear model proposed in @xcite , tacitly choose _",
    "@xmath127 this statement is misleading . in our work",
    "we explicitly give examples of maps with two unstable fixed points , where this relation is obviously wrong . in these maps",
    "one has two singularities in the infinite density , so the infinite density is of the type @xmath128 here we have two @xmath51 s , which , as we discussed above , for asymmetric maps are non identical .",
    "so , choosing a specific @xmath51 does not make any sense at all .",
    "we emphasize that our results are general and they are not sensitive to the choice of @xmath51 , neither are they specific for one particular map .",
    "rather we use equation ( [ eq3 ] ) which makes our results general while equation ( [ eqsv ] ) is not .     for the pomeau - manneville map with @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) calculated with different initial conditions : solid line @xmath59 for @xmath60 , dashed line @xmath61 for @xmath62 , dotted line @xmath63 for @xmath60 .",

    "an exact relation between complexity and @xmath138 is given . since @xmath77 is not directly computable , replacing @xmath77 in equation ( 20 ) with the estimator @xmath137 yields equation  ( 28 ) which is not rigorous , and",
    "so far supported by numerical evidence only .",

    "to go beyond general relations and for the sake of specific predictions we need estimates for the infinite invariant density .",
    "that goal is in principle rather simple .",
    "we start the evolution with initial conditions whose density does not contain a delta function , e.g. uniform initial conditions and after long measurement time estimate @xmath0 using ( [ eq3 ] ) . numerically we now demonstrate that the infinite invariant density defined by ( [ eq3 ] ) does not depend on the choice of initial conditions . namely we assume a normalizable initial density , not containing singularities ( like delta functions ) .",

    "we see that @xmath0 is independent of the initial state .",
    "this implies that one can attain an estimate for the infinite invariant density rather easily , though more rigorous work is needed to give estimates on the convergence rate .",
    "our work also shows that the generalized lyapunov exponent , can be estimated starting from different initial conditions .",
    "of course at short times the estimates will vary from one initial condition to another , however as shown in figure [ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] different initial states give the same estimate for @xmath146 in perfect agreement with the generalized pesin identity .",
    "in the mathematical literature the infinite invariant density is defined up to an arbitrary multiplicative constant .",
    "we followed william of occam economical philosophy and we fixed the constant to unity . more practically , to test predictions of a theory we need estimates for the infinite invariant density , which we obtain from a theory or numerics .",
