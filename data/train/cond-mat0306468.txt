    "recently , the study of the field - induced effects in low - dimensional quantum spin systems has been attracting much interest from theoretical and experimental points of view @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . for the system with an anisotropy of exchange interactions the magnetic properties essentially depend on the direction of the applied magnetic field . for example",
    ", the behavior of the one - dimensional antiferromagnetic @xmath5 model in a transverse magnetic field is drastically different in comparison with the case of the longitudinal field . in particular",
    ", the transverse field induces the staggered magnetization in the perpendicular direction and the continuous phase transition takes places at some critical field @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this effect has been observed in quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnet @xmath6 @xcite , where the magnetic field has both the transverse and longitudinal components .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the properties of the antiferromagnetic @xmath7 @xmath5 model in mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields @xmath8    we consider the most simple case of this model  the antiferromagnetic ising chain given by the hamiltonian @xmath9    in spite of the simple form of this hamiltonian it can not be solved exactly . in @xcite",
    "the ground state phase diagram of this model has been investigated using numerical diagonalization of finite systems and finite size scaling procedure .",
    "it was found @xcite that the transition line between the ordered and disordered phases exists and it was assumed that the model belongs to the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "we note that the ferromagnetic ising chain in the mixed fields has been studied intensively @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "though the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic ising chains in the transverse magnetic field are equivalent , properties of these two models are very different at @xmath10 .",
    "( in fact , the model ( [ h ] ) can be transformed to the ferromagnetic chain but in a staggered longitudinal field . ) for example , the ground state phase transition in the ferromagnetic model is smeared out by the longitudinal field in contrast to the antiferromagnetic model for which the phase transition remains at @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    "we study the model ( [ h ] ) using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique @xcite .",
    "this method allows us to consider the systems up to a few hundred sites and to determine the transition line with high accuracy . using the finite - size estimation of the ground state energy and low - lying excitations",
    "we will show that the model ( [ h ] ) on the transition line is described by the conformal field theory with the central charge @xmath11 .",
    "besides , we consider the behavior of the model in the vicinity of the special points @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and determine the form of the transition line near these points .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we will provide a qualitative physical  picture of the ground state phase diagram based on the classical approach . in sec.iii and",
    "sec.iv the behavior of the system in the vicinity of the special points of the critical line will be considered . in sec.v",
    "we will present the dmrg calculation of the critical line .",
    "sec.vi is devoted to the connection of the model ( [ h ] ) with the statistical quasi - one - dimensional ising model in the external magnetic field . in summary",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "in order to provide a physical picture of the phase diagram of the model ( [ h ] ) we use the classical approximation , when spins are represented as three - dimensional vectors .",
    "the classical ground state is given by a configuration in which all spin vectors lie in the @xmath16 plane with the spins on odd and even sites pointing respectively at angles @xmath17 and @xmath18 with respect to the @xmath19 axis .",
    "the classical energy of this state is @xmath20    the angles @xmath17 and @xmath21 , minimizing this energy are solutions of the following equations @xmath22    the solution of these equations is simple in the particular cases @xmath13 @xmath23 and @xmath14@xmath24    but in general case , when @xmath25 and @xmath10 , the phase diagram is divided on two regions ( see fig .  [ fig_1 ] ) . in the paramagnetic region ( pm )",
    "the energy minimum is given by the configuration with @xmath26 , with @xmath27 determined by the equation @xmath28        the antiferromagnetic ( af ) region is characterized by non - zero staggered magnetizations in both @xmath19 and @xmath29 directions @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "thus , in the af region the magnetic fields induce a perpendicular antiferromagnetic long - range order ( lro ) . in the classical approach the value @xmath32 plays the role of the lro and it vanishes on the transition line determined by the equations @xmath33 where @xmath34    the solution of eqs.([eqtransclass ] ) gives the transition line in the explicit form @xmath35    the classical phase diagram",
    "is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "the transition ( critical ) line separates the phase with non - zero afm lro from the phase with uniform magnetization ( the paramagnetic phase ) .",
    "of course , the classical approach does not give the correct description of the phase transition .",
    "at first , the quantum fluctuations shift the critical point @xmath36 to @xmath12 at @xmath13 .",
    "secondly , the form of the critical line is certainly incorrect at @xmath37 . besides , the order parameter @xmath32 vanishes on the critical line with the critical exponent @xmath38 , which is not valid at least in the critical point @xmath39",
    "nevertheless , the fact of the generation of the staggered magnetizations perpendicular to the field direction is qualitatively true .",
    "before the numerical determination of the critical line we consider the behavior of the model ( [ h ] ) in the vicinity of two special points : @xmath39 and @xmath4",
    ". this will give us the form of the critical line near these points .",
    "in the case @xmath13 the model ( [ h ] ) reduces to the exactly solvable one - dimensional ising model in the transverse field ( the itf model ) .",
    "this model is well studied @xcite and it belongs to the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model . at @xmath40",
    "the itf model is gapped and there is non - zero staggered magnetization @xmath41 .",
    "the ground state at @xmath40 is two - fold degenerated in the thermodynamic limit . at the point",
    "@xmath12 the model becomes gapless and the staggered magnetization vanishes with the critical exponent @xmath42 .",
    "this is the transition point from the antiferromagnetic state to the paramagnetic gapped state .",
    "the gap vanishes linearly at @xmath12 .",
    "now we consider the itf model with small longitudinal magnetic field . for small magnetic field @xmath1",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) in the form @xmath43    after jordan - wigner transformation to the fermi operators @xmath44 , @xmath45 @xmath46 the itf hamiltonian @xmath47 takes a bilinear form @xmath48    the hamiltonian @xmath47 commutes with the parity operator @xmath49 because @xmath47 can change the number of @xmath50 excitation by an even number only .",
    "therefore , the space of states of @xmath47 is divided on two sectors with odd ( @xmath51 ) and even ( @xmath52 ) number of the fermi particles @xmath50 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath47 is diagonalized exactly @xcite @xmath53 with fermi particles @xmath54 and spectrum @xmath55 which gives a gap at momentum @xmath56 @xmath57    the gap vanishes at the critical point @xmath58 , where the spectrum becomes @xmath59    below in this section we will consider the perturbation theory in @xmath60 ( [ hv0 ] ) in the critical point @xmath58 .    the transition operator @xmath61 in @xmath60 ( [ hv0 ] ) conserves the momentum and changes the parity , because as it follows from eq.([jw ] ) it changes the number of the fermi particles @xmath62 ( and also the number of @xmath54 particles ) by odd number .",
    "therefore , the non - zero matrix elements with the transition operator @xmath63 have the states with equal momentum but different parity .",
    "the last fact means that the perturbation theory in @xmath60 contains only even orders .",
    "the second order correction to the ground state energy is : @xmath64    the ground state @xmath65 has the momentum @xmath66 and zero number of the @xmath54 particles ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "therefore , the non - zero contribution to the sum in ( [ de2 ] ) is given by the intermediate states @xmath67 with zero momentum and the parity @xmath51 .",
    "as follows from eq.([aspectrum ] ) , all states @xmath67 with momentum @xmath66 and odd number of the @xmath54 particles ( @xmath51 ) have ` high ' energies @xmath68 . on the contrary , among the states with @xmath66 and even number of the @xmath54 particles ( @xmath52 )",
    "there are many states like @xmath69 with small @xmath70 having small excitation energies @xmath71 and they can lead to infrared divergencies .",
    "hereinafter we consider large but finite systems of length @xmath72 .",
    "we shall study the dependence of dominant contributions to the perturbation theory on @xmath72 , omitting numerical factors .",
    "using the fact that @xmath73 one can rewrite eq.([de2 ] ) as @xmath74    in higher orders of the perturbation series for the ground state energy each second intermediate state @xmath67 has odd number of the fermi particles ( @xmath51 ) , and , therefore , high energy @xmath75 .",
    "for example , let us consider the fourth order correction to the ground state energy @xmath76    all intermediate states @xmath77 have momentum @xmath66 .",
    "the states @xmath78 have @xmath52 and some of them have small excitation energies @xmath79 , while the states @xmath80 and @xmath81 have @xmath51 and high energies @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , one can sum over the intermediate states @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which reduces eq.([de4 ] ) to @xmath83    now we note , that this expression looks like the second order correction and eq.([de22 ] ) looks like the first order correction to the ground state energy with a perturbation @xmath84 . in a similar way one can sum over all intermediate states with @xmath66 and @xmath51 in all orders of perturbation series . as a result",
    ", we arrive at the perturbation theory with the effective perturbation @xmath85    we note , that the perturbation theory with the perturbation @xmath86 coincides with the original perturbation theory ( [ hv0 ] ) in a sense , that both perturbation series have the same order of divergencies ( or power of @xmath72 ) at each order in @xmath1 . but numerical factors at each order in @xmath1 can be different .    the perturbation @xmath86 commutes with the parity operator ( [ parity ] ) and conserves the momentum .",
    "therefore , the perturbation series in @xmath86 contains the intermediate states with @xmath66 and @xmath52 only , and some of these states have small excitation energies @xmath87 .",
    "these states give the most divergent contribution to the perturbation series in @xmath86 and further we shall take into account these states only .",
    "now we need to estimate the matrix elements of the operator @xmath88 .",
    "the behavior of the correlation function @xmath89 in the ground state and in the low - lying states with excitation energies @xmath87 on large distances is known @xcite @xmath90 and , therefore , due to oscillation of the correlator @xmath91 the sum over @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be estimated as @xmath94 where the constant was found from extrapolation of the exact results for finite chains with @xmath95 .",
    "the non - diagonal matrix elements of the operator @xmath96 with two different low - lying states was also calculated numerically .",
    "it was found that the only non - zero matrix elements ( in the thermodynamic limit ) are given by the states @xmath97 differing by two @xmath54 particles , like @xmath98 .",
    "all such pairs of states give the same value for the matrix element @xmath99 while all other matrix elements exponentially drop with @xmath72 .",
    "now we estimate all terms of perturbation series in @xmath1 . according to eq.([v1diag ] ) the second order correction ( [ de22 ] ) is proportional to @xmath100 .",
    "the factor at @xmath100 was found numerically by exact diagonalization of finite systems and the following calculation of the sum ( [ de2 ] ) .",
    "the data for @xmath95 are well extrapolated and give @xmath101    according to eq.([de23 ] ) the zero - field susceptibility is @xmath102 .",
    "this result is in a perfect agreement with the value @xmath103 obtained analytically in @xcite .    using eq.([v1nodiag ] ) we find that the non - zero contribution to the fourth order correction to the ground state energy ( [ de42 ] ) is given by the states @xmath104 with the excitation energy @xmath105 .",
    "thus , because of small excitation energies at @xmath106 in denominator in ( [ de42 ] ) the fourth order correction to the ground state energy turns out to be proportional to @xmath72 ( we omit here logarithmic corrections ) @xmath107    the @xmath93-th order in @xmath86 is proportional to @xmath108 .",
    "the denominator of the @xmath93-th order contains @xmath109 small excitation energies @xmath110 and all matrix elements in the numerator are of the order of unity .",
    "therefore , the @xmath93-th order in @xmath86 diverges as @xmath111 .",
    "but this is not valid for odd orders in @xmath86 .",
    "the analysis shows that all odd orders in @xmath86 diverge as @xmath112 .",
    "for example , the third order correction in @xmath86 ( the sixth order in @xmath1 ) for the ground state energy does not diverge : @xmath113    so , the odd orders in @xmath86 give the next order corrections to the ground state energy and we omit it below .",
    "summarize all above , we arrive at the perturbation series in the form @xmath114 with @xmath115 ( eq.([de23 ] ) ) and unknown constants @xmath116 .",
    "one can see that the first divergence appears only in the eight - th order in @xmath1 , and it is very difficult to observe it numerically . the exact numerical calculations up to @xmath117 of the second , the fourth and the sixth order corrections in @xmath1 confirm the form of the series ( [ de0ser ] ) .",
    "the sum in eq.([de0ser ] ) forms the scaling function @xmath118 of the scaling parameter @xmath119 .",
    "thus , the ground state energy takes the form @xmath120    since the ground state energy is proportional to @xmath72 , the scaling function @xmath118 has finite thermodynamic limit at @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the leading term of the perturbation theory for the ground state energy is given by the second order and the divergent part of the perturbation theory gives the correction @xmath122 .",
    "the perturbation series for low - lying states has the same form as in eq.([de0 ] ) , but each low - lying state has its own scaling function .",
    "therefore , for the first excited state ( with momentum @xmath123 ) one has @xmath124    so , the mass gap @xmath125 appears as : @xmath126 where @xmath127 and the scaling function @xmath128 .",
    "since the gap is finite , the scaling function @xmath129 in the thermodynamic limit at @xmath121 must tend to some finite limit @xmath130    from the last equation we see that the gap is proportional to @xmath131 , but the factor at @xmath131 is given not only by the second order correction @xmath132 but by all collected divergent orders of the perturbation series .",
    "the numerical estimation of the second order correction to the gap gives @xmath133    in order to find the factor at @xmath131 in mass gap we performed dmrg calculations ( for details see sec.v ) of the model ( [ hv0 ] ) for @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the dependence of the gap on the scaling parameter @xmath119 is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] .",
    "one can see that the points with different @xmath72 and @xmath1 lie perfectly on one curve .",
    "it definitely manifests that the scaling parameter is @xmath100 .",
    "the dmrg calculation data give the mass gap @xmath136        from this equation follows that the second order correction to the mass gap  ( [ m2 ] ) gives approximately one half of a total gap , and another half is collected by all other divergent orders contained in the scaling function @xmath137 .",
    "we note , that in contrast to eq.([mvalue ] ) for the ferromagnetic itf  model the mass gap at the critical point @xmath12 is proportional to @xmath138 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "let us return to the estimation of the diagonal element of the operator @xmath86 ( [ v1diag ] ) .",
    "using the fact of the oscillation of the correlator ( [ zzcorr ] ) in the ground state and in the low - lying states we can rewrite the sum in ( [ v1diag ] ) approximately as a one half of the first term : @xmath139    the last equation suggests that the perturbation @xmath86 can be reduced to the operator @xmath140 @xmath141 with some constants @xmath142 , which we will define later . in order to verify this assumption",
    "we compared the matrix elements of the operator @xmath140 with those of @xmath86 .",
    "we have found that the dependence of the matrix elements of the operator @xmath140 on @xmath72 is in a full accord with eqs.([v1diag ] ) and ( [ v1nodiag ] ) .",
    "that is , the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath140 are proportional to @xmath72 and the only non - zero ( non - diagonal ) matrix elements have the pairs of states differing by two @xmath54 particles @xmath143    thus , we arrive at the effective hamiltonian @xmath144    again , the original model ( [ hv0 ] ) is equivalent to the effective model ( [ hmap ] ) in a sense , that the perturbation series for both models have the same order of divergencies ( or power of @xmath72 ) at each order of @xmath1 .",
    "but numerical factors at each order of @xmath1 can be different .",
    "the advantage of this mapping lies in the fact that the effective model ( [ hmap ] ) is of the itf type and , therefore , is exactly solvable one .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath145 is @xmath146 with @xmath147 .",
    "so , according to the spectrum of the effective model ( [ hmapspectrum ] )  the magnetic field @xmath1 produces the gap in the spectrum @xmath148    as was noted above , apart from numerical factors the effective model ( [ hmap ] ) has the same form of perturbation series in @xmath1 as the original model ( [ hv0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can check the form of the perturbation theory ( [ de0ser ] ) by studying the perturbation series in @xmath1 of the exactly solvable model ( [ hmap ] ) .    for large but finite systems the ground state energy ( with @xmath66 ) and the first excited state ( with @xmath123 ) of the hamiltonian ( [ hmap ] ) are known exactly @xcite : @xmath149 where @xmath150",
    ".    the perturbation series for the ground state energy and the gap can be easily found by formal expansion of these expressions in small parameter @xmath151 .",
    "this results in the scaling form of perturbation series for the mass gap : @xmath152 where constants @xmath153 determine the scaling function @xmath154 of a scaling parameter @xmath155 @xmath156",
    "the scaling function @xmath154 was found in @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath121 the function @xmath157 , resulting in the gap ( [ gapmap ] )",
    "one can see that the scaling parameter and the form of the perturbation series ( [ hmapser ] ) coincides with eq.([mser ] ) .",
    "now we define the constants @xmath158 and @xmath159 in eq.([hmap ] ) , so that the second order corrections to the ground state energy and the gap of the effective model ( [ hmap ] ) numerically coincide with eqs.([de23 ] ) and ( [ m2 ] ) .",
    "this leads to the values @xmath160    the mass gap of the effective model ( [ hmap ] ) with constants @xmath158 and @xmath159 defined above is @xmath161    surprisingly , the value of the mass gap of the effective model turns out to be very close to one found numerically for the original model ( eq.([mvalue ] ) ) .",
    "it means , that the gap scaling function @xmath154 of the effective model ( [ hmap ] )  has the same thermodynamic limit as that for the model ( [ hv0 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we have calculated numerically the  fourth order corrections in @xmath1 to the ground state energy and the gap for the models ( [ hv0 ] ) and ( [ hmap ] ) and found perfect numerical agreement ( the second order corrections in @xmath1 for both models coincide by the definition ( [ ab ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that the mapping of the model ( [ hv0 ] ) at @xmath58 to the model ( [ hmap ] ) with constants @xmath158 and @xmath159 defined in ( [ ab ] ) is exact for low - lying excitations in the thermodynamic limit .    the mapping of the model ( [ hv0 ] ) to the effective itf model can be extended to the case @xmath162 . for this case",
    "the effective hamiltonian becomes @xmath163 where now the constants @xmath142 are the functions of @xmath0 .",
    "the functions @xmath164 and @xmath165 are defined in such a way that the second order corrections to the ground state energy and the gap for the effective model ( [ hmap ] ) coincide with those for the original model ( [ hv0 ] ) .    using the effective hamiltonian ( [ hmaphx ] )",
    "one can calculate the susceptibility @xmath166 . in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath58 it has a logarithmic singularity @xmath167 with @xmath168 from eq.([de23 ] ) and @xmath169 ( eq.([ab ] ) ) .",
    "another exactly solvable limit of the model ( [ h ] ) is the case @xmath14 .",

    "the transverse field @xmath0 lifts the degeneracy .",
    "the exact calculation of the first order correction in @xmath0 for @xmath175 is rather complicated because it involves the exponentially large number of degenerate states .",

    "the finite - size correction to this excitation energy is @xmath234    for the itf model at @xmath12 the sound velocity is @xmath235 .",
    "the ground state has a momentum @xmath66 and the lowest excitation energy in the sector with momentum @xmath66 is @xmath236 and in the sector with @xmath123 is @xmath237    thus , the scaling dimensions are @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "the corresponding associated operators are @xmath240 which is in accord with the well known results @xcite for the asymptotic of the correlation functions @xmath241    using eq.([decft ] ) we numerically checked that the scaling dimensions related to the finite - size corrections of the lowest excited eigenstates on the critical line remain as in itf model @xmath238 and @xmath242 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the model ( [ h ] ) on the critical line belongs to the universality class of the itf model .",
    "this means that in accord with the prediction of the classical approach to the left of the critical line the staggered magnetizations @xmath243 and @xmath244 exist .",
    "but in contrast to the classical approach they vanish on the critical line with the critical exponent @xmath42 .",
    "the mass gap is closed on the critical line and the critical exponent for the gap is equal to unity , i.e. the scaling behavior of the gap near the critical line is linear . for the particular case @xmath245 ,",
    "this is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] . where the scaling plot for the scaled mass @xmath246 with @xmath247 is shown .",
    "the behavior of the critical line near the itf point @xmath3 can be found from the following consideration .",
    "as it was established above in the vicinity of the critical line the gap is proportional to deviation from the line .",
    "this is valid for any direction of deviation except the direction at a tangent to the critical line . in the vicinity of the itf critical point for fixed @xmath248",
    "according to eq.([h0gap ] ) the gap is @xmath249 . on the other hand ,",
    "the gap is given by eq.([mvalue ] ) .",
    "combining these two expressions for the gap on the line @xmath58 , we obtain equation for the critical line in the vicinity of the point @xmath3 as @xmath250    this expression for the critical line is in a very good agreement with our numerical estimations up to @xmath251 .    in the vicinity of the multicritical point the form of the critical line",
    "can be found in a similar way . at @xmath15 and @xmath37",
    "the mass gap is proportional to @xmath0 ( see eq.([emhx0 ] ) ) . on the other hand , for fixed @xmath37",
    "this gap is proportional to a deviation from the critical line @xmath252 .",
    "therefore , the critical line near the multicritical point behaves as @xmath253 .",
    "the numerical coefficient @xmath254 has been found from the dmrg calculation of the critical line in the vicinity of the multicritical point . as a result ,",
    "the form of the critical line at @xmath37 is @xmath255    this form differs from that given in @xcite , where @xmath256 .",
    "it is well - known that the critical properties of the two - dimensional ising model are equivalent to those of the one - dimensional itf model @xcite . using the formalism of ref.@xcite",
    "one can show that the quantum hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is related to the transfer matrix of the strong anisotropic ( quasi - one - dimensional ) ising model in the uniform magnetic field .",
    "this model describes ferromagnetic ising chains weakly antiferromagnetically coupled with each other .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath257 where @xmath258 , @xmath259 .",
    "the relation between the model ( [ h ] ) and the model ( [ h2d ] ) are given by @xmath260 with @xmath261 .",
    "the equivalence of these two models means that the model ( [ h2d ] ) undergoes the phase transition from the ordered ( at @xmath262 ) to the disordered ( at @xmath263 ) phase .",
    "the critical line @xmath264 of the quasi - one dimensional model are related to the critical line @xmath210 of the model ( [ h ] ) . by use of mapping ( [ 1d-2d ] )",
    "we obtain that the critical temperature @xmath264 is @xmath265    in particular , at @xmath266 @xmath267 and @xmath268 when @xmath269 as @xmath270    the order parameter @xmath271 vanishes at @xmath272 with the critical exponent @xmath273 .",
    "we note that the phase transition does not occur if @xmath274 as well as in the ferromagnetic version of the model ( [ h ] ) .",
    "the free energy of the model ( [ h2d ] ) is related to the ground state energy of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) by @xmath275    according to eqs.([chi ] ) , ( [ 1d-2d ] ) and ( [ free_en ] ) the zero - field susceptibility in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath276 can be obtained using exactly solvable effective model ( [ hmap ] ) . at @xmath277",
    "the susceptibility is @xmath278    the last equation has a form coinciding with the results obtained for the two - dimensional antiferromagnetic ising model by the series expansion method @xcite .",
    "we have studied the antiferromagnetic ising chain in the mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "it was shown that the quantum phase transition existing in the itf model remains in the presence of the uniform longitudinal field . using the dmrg simulations we have found the critical line in the ( @xmath2 ) plane where the mass gap is closed and",
    "the staggered magnetizations along the @xmath19 and @xmath29 axes vanish .",
    "it is found numerically that the model on the critical line is described by the conformal field theory with the central charge @xmath279 , i.e. it belongs to the universality class of the itf model .    the scaling behavior in the vicinity of the itf critical point is studied in detail .",
    "it is shown that the mass gap is proportional to @xmath131 and the contributions to it are given not only by the second order correction but also by all other divergent orders of the perturbation series in @xmath1 . besides , the analysis of the perturbation theory shows that the considered model at @xmath248 can be mapped to the effective itf model with renormalized parameters depending on @xmath1 . in a framework of the effective itf model the behavior of the susceptibility at @xmath280 is determined .",

    "of course , the considered model is the simplest case of the @xmath5 model ( [ hxxz ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to extend the present analysis to this model as well as to study effects of interchain interactions in quasi - one - dimensional generalization of the model ( [ h ] ) .",
    "the mapping of the quantum model ( [ h ] ) to the strongly anisotropic statistical two - dimensional ising model in the uniform magnetic field was considered .",
    "the behavior of the susceptibility of this model near the critical temperature is found .",
    "we expect also , that the main features of the considered model ( [ h ] ) are valid for the statistical two - dimensional antiferromagnetic ising model in the uniform magnetic field @xmath281 .",
    "that is , the applied magnetic field does not smear  the phase transition existing in the two - dimensional ising model , which is generic case for the whole transition line @xmath264 in the plane ( @xmath282 ) .",
    "in particular , we believe that the analysis of the perturbation series in @xmath283 in the same manner as was done in sec.iii gives the scaling behavior for the correlation length and the form of the critical line near the point @xmath276 is @xmath284 ."
