    "gliese 229b is the first sub - stellar object outside the solar system with an effective temperature , t@xmath3 , well below 1800 k , the minimum t@xmath3 for stars , found using direct imaging techniques ( nakajima et al .",
    "other sub - stellar companions have been inferred to exist through indirect techniques ( wolszczan & frail @xcite ; mayor &  queloz @xcite ; butler et al .",
    "the astrophysical nature of all these objects can only be understood in detail through spectroscopic studies .",
    "unfortunately current technology precludes the spectroscopic study of any of these objects , except gliese 229b .",
    "interestingly , the spectrum of a gaseous , sub - stellar object is primarily determined by its effective temperature , and secondarily by its surface gravity and composition ( burrows et al .",
    "@xcite ; burrows et al .",
    "@xcite ) . thus",
    ", the spectrum of gliese 229b is expected to resemble the spectra of some of the less massive , but similarly hot , giant planets found in the radial velocity studies .    here",
    "we present the spectrum of gliese 229b with high signal to noise ratio from 0.837 @xmath2 m out to 5 @xmath2 m .",
    "gliese 229b emits approximately 65% of its emergent flux in this wavelength region .",
    "an effort like this can perhaps be seen as a precursor to extrasolar planet studies or an extension of the work of hundreds of planetary scientists who have studied and modelled the atmospheres of the planets orbitting the sun .",
    "in addition , these observations also give extremely interesting insights into the atmospheric physics of brown dwarfs , including the atmospheric dynamics .",
    "our now detailed set of observations can be compared with recent models .",
    "all observations reported here were made at the keck telescopes . at these telescopes , a major problem in observing gliese",
    "229b is the presence of diffraction spikes from gliese 229a .",
    "the image of a star produced by one of the keck telescopes has six diffraction spikes spaced every 60  around the center of the image .",
    "these spikes are produced by both the secondary support vanes and the primary mirror s segment gaps .",
    "the spikes are fixed with respect to the horizon . in celestial coordinates ,",
    "the position angle of any spike is the paralactic angle plus an integer multiple of 60  ( see right - top panel of figure 1 ) . as a result ,",
    "the spikes rotate as the star transits the sky .",
    "useful spectra of gliese 229b could only be obtained when the diffraction spikes of the very much brighter gliese 229a were @xmath4 away from the position angle of gliese 229b .",
    "this reduced the time during which it was possible to observe gliese 229b to 1.5 hours just after transit .",
    "since gliese 229b is not visible on the slit - viewing camera , we set up on gliese 229a and applied a blind offset from there ( 778 at position angle 1613 ; nakajima et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we observed gliese 229b using the keck i telescope on 21 january 1996 ( ut ) with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "we made three exposures of 1800 s duration each , using a tektronix 2048@xmath52048 pixel ccd with 24 @xmath2 m pixels .",
    "we used the 1200 line mm@xmath6 grating , blazed at 750 nm to cover the wavelength region of 847 nm to 973 nm at 0.06 nm per pixel .",
    "a 1  slit , corresponding to 4.65 pixels , gave a spectral resolution of about 0.3 nm . the slit was placed east - west for all of the lris observations .",
    "an og570 filter suppressed the second order spectrum .    on 6 february 1997 ( ut ) ,",
    "three more 900 s lris exposures were taken in the middle of the interval when the diffraction spikes were more than @xmath7 away .",
    "the set - up was the same , except that the instrument had been moved to keck  ii , and we used a new , more efficient 831 line mm@xmath6 grating , blazed for a wavelength of 810 nm , covering the wavelength range 837 nm to 1024 nm at 0.09 nm per pixel .",
    "with the 1  slit , the resolution was about 0.4 nm . on both nights",
    "the seeing was generally sub - arcsecond ( @xmath8 08 ) and a few thin cirrus clouds sailed about in the sky .",
    "the spectra from these two observations were combined by smoothing the higher resolution spectrum to the 0.4 nm resolution and adding them .",
    "full details on the reduction technique follow .",
    "the spectral data were reduced using midas and programs running in the midas environment .",
    "the presence of gliese 229a s diffraction spikes in the spectral images required special care during the reduction .",
    "the approach we used is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the top panel shows a typical spectral image , after bias - subtraction and flat - field correction .",
    "first we removed the telluric emission lines ( mostly oh ) .",
    "for this purpose , a third - degree polynomial was fitted through every column in regions free of stellar light ( indicated by ` s ' on the right - hand side of the panel ) .",
    "the subtraction of the strongest sky lines is not always satisfactory ( see second panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "most likely , this results from the fact that interference fringing in the ccd is not corrected adequately for the sky emission lines , as the response of a given pixel to monochromatic light is different from the response to the continuum emission from the flat - field lamp .",
    "the resulting structure over a column has a relatively large scale , however , and is mostly removed in the next step , in which the scattered and diffracted light from gliese 229a is subtracted by fitting a second - degree polynomial to two small regions adjacent to the spectrum of gliese 229b ( see figure 1 ) . as the spectra",
    "are not aligned perfectly , these regions are chosen slightly differently for different parts of the chip .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted using a scheme similar to the `` optimal extraction '' technique of horn ( @xcite ) , in which an average stellar profile along the slit is created to estimate the total flux from each pixel in a given column .",
    "all estimates are combined using weights inversely proportional to the square of each pixel s formal uncertainty ( determined from the read noise and poisson noise in the raw data ) .",
    "in the lower panel of figure 1 , we show the difference between the raw data and the extracted data ( in standard deviations ) .",
    "it is apparent that the extraction is quite accurate , since very little structure remains .",
    "we also extracted the spectrum of gliese 229a with the same technique , after removing the contribution from gliese 229b from the image .",
    "this allows us to verify that no contamination from gliese 229a remains in gliese 229b s spectrum .",
    "indeed figure 6 shows that none of the features in a are present in the spectrum of b.    wavelength calibration employed argon and krypton / mercury arc spectra taken after the series of exposures .",
    "for the 1200 line mm@xmath6 spectra , only 7 lines were available , but they were quite evenly spread over the wavelength range .",
    "a fit to these lines s positions with a third - degree polynomial left a root - mean - square residual of 0.023 pixel .",
    "for the 831 line mm@xmath6 spectra , 11 lines were used ( achieving an rms of 0.03 pixel ) , but none of these were longward of 970 nm . however , a comparison of the locations of oh airglow lines in our spectral images with the wavelengths given by osterbrock et al .",
    "( @xcite ) shows that the wavelength calibation is accurate to better than 0.1 nm everywhere on the spectrum .",
    "for removal of telluric water vapour lines as well as relative flux calibration , we used spectra of feige  34 ( sdo ; @xmath9 ; massey & gronwall @xcite ) , taken after gliese 229b at similar airmass .",
    "the final absolute flux calibration was achieved using the photometric results in matthews et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .      on the nights of february 8 and 9 , 1997 ( ut ) we obtained the z , j , h ,",
    "k , l and m band spectra using the near infrared camera ( nirc ; matthews &  soifer @xcite ) at the cassegrain focus of the keck i telescope .",
    "these spectra were obtained in several stages using the grism mode of the camera .",
    "the camera permits recording of low - resolution spectra in the z , j and h bands simultaneously , then the h and k bands and finally the l and m bands .",
    "the `` zjh '' region was obtained in 10 exposures of 40 s of `` on - source '' exposure time .",
    "after every 40 s exposure , we shifted the telescope 156 north and took a 40 s long `` sky '' frame .",
    "the slit was placed east - west , as it was during the lris observations .",
    "this produced pairs of `` on - source '' exposures taken right before corresponding `` sky '' exposures .",
    "the distance 156 was chosen so that we would be sampling exactly the same sky background relative to the primary star ( gliese 229a ) , but on the opposite side of the star .",
    "this seemed to be the optimal way to remove the point - symetric background .",
    "we used the grism with 150 line mm@xmath6 and a slit 4.5 pixels wide ( 0675 ) to obtain the `` zjh '' spectrum .",
    "blocking filters were in place so that only light from the z , j and h bands reached the detector .",
    "the h band spectrum was obtained a second time in a series of 22 more 40 s exposures ( plus 22 corresponding sky exposures ) in which the h and k spectra were recorded . in these spectra ,",
    "the 120 line mm@xmath6 grism was in place with corresponding blocking filters as well .",
    "the weather was clear and photometric and the seeing was 07 on both nights .",
    "the l and m band spectra were slightly trickier to obtain .",
    "as far as we know this work represents the first time the keck telescope has been used for 3 @xmath2 m to 5 @xmath2 m spectroscopic observations . as a result we had to ascertain which electronics settings were optimal and what readout times and integrations were necessary .",
    "as shown by the results presented here , nirc is fully capable and rather sensitive in these wavelength bands .",
    "all of the spectral images contained both gliese 229a and b , due to the diffraction spikes of a. data reduction involved the following steps .",
    "for each `` on - source '' frame ( which entailed the coaddition by the nirc electronics of 1000 individual array readouts ) we subtracted the `` sky '' frame immediately following .",
    "we then extracted spectra from bars ten pixels in width across the slit of both gliese 229b and a. gliese 229b s spectral signature was quite detectable in the single , `` sky - subtracted '' images .",
    "the extraction technique involved the `` optimal extraction '' method in which the pixels are summed in the spatial direction but weighted according to the signal in each pixel .",
    "the technique is similar to that used for the optical data , and it leads to a significant improvement in signal - to - noise ratio over simple addition . to make sure",
    "the sky background and particularly any contamination from a were not present in our final spectrum , we subtracted the corresponding `` optimally extracted '' spectrum ten pixels to either side of the spectral region of b.    we removed the instrumental response by dividing the extracted spectrum by the extracted spectrum of a calibrator star . in the case of the z , j , h and k bands",
    "this calibrator was sao 175039 , a g8 star which smoothly approximates a black body spectrum through this wavelength region , except for a few hydrogen absorption lines which we edited out by linear interpolation . in the case of the l and m bands , we used gliese 229a , an m1v star , which is quite flat in the region redward of 2 @xmath2 m .",
    "( for l and m spectra of other early m dwarfs , see berriman &  reid @xcite or tinney et al .",
    "ideally one should use a calibrator star such as a bright f or g type star .",
    "however , the use of a is sufficient in this case .",
    "absolute flux calibration involved matching the flux density in the spectrum with the photometric measurements of matthews et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .    the wavelength calibration of the infrared data involved a simple method .",
    "we used the edges of the filter bands , clearly visible in the calibrator star spectra , to determine the wavelengths of the edges of each segment of the spectrum .",
    "the 50% transmission points of the bands are known to an accuracy of 10 nm . with these `` edge wavelengths ''",
    "known we linearly interpolated to determine the wavelength for each pixel across the spectrum .",
    "this introduces errors on the scale of 1 nm .    finally we added all of the extracted , calibrated spectra together .",
    "figure 2 compares our 1 @xmath2 m to 2.5 @xmath2 m spectrum with the higher resolution spectrum of geballe et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the plot shows that there is good agreement between the spectra .",
    "the differences , which are most pronounced in the 1 @xmath2 m to 1.1 @xmath2 m and the 1.6 @xmath2 m to 2 @xmath2 m regions , amount to no more than 10%  of the signal .",
    "these discrepancies are attributable to possible minor contamination from gliese 229a in the 1.6 @xmath2 m to 2.0 @xmath2 m region of our spectrum as well as some minor differences in wavelength calibration .",
    "alternatively , the geballe et al . ( @xcite ) spectrum might have been affected by atmospheric dispersion , causing some of the bluer wavelegths to be slightly reduced in brightness since some of the blue light would have been blocked by the slit . in geballe",
    "it is shown that the small features in the brighter parts of the spectrum are almost entirely real and correspond closely to known absorption lines in water .",
    "our spectrum is unable to resolve these features .",
    "however , the agreement between the spectra is an excellent confirmation of the data , as well as an indicator that our reduction method works and has no major contamination from scattered light from gliese 229a .",
    "figure 3 shows the relative instrumental response of nirc with the 60 line mm@xmath6 grism in the l band plotted along with our spectrum of gliese 229b .",
    "the absorption band at about 3.4 @xmath2 m is due to the resin inside nirc .",
    "this resin is applied to the surface that will become the grating .",
    "then a master grating is pressed against the resin so that an imprint of the grating is left in the resin , which subsequently dries and becomes the `` replicant '' grating used in nirc .",
    "the instrumental transmission curve is simply the extracted spectrum of gliese 229a , which , as we mentioned above , is flat in this region .",
    "the final spectrum of b shows none of the features due to this instrumental response .",
    "the complete spectrum is presented in figure 4 , with the most important features labelled .",
    "the 1 @xmath2 m to 2.5 @xmath2 m part of this spectrum has been discussed in detail in oppenheimer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and geballe et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "hence we concentrate on the new short and long wavelength parts . in the latter",
    "we find the fundamental methane band at 3.3 @xmath2 m , and an interesting small feature in the m band which we attribute to co , in confirmation of the claims of noll et al .",
    "( @xcite ; see section [ sec : co ] ) . in the optical part , shown enlarged in figure 5 , there are two prominent atomic lines due to cesium , a very weak feature caused by methane and a strong steam band .",
    "these are all discussed in detail in the following sections .    before discussing the detailed parts of the spectrum it is useful to compare the spectrum of gliese 229b with spectra of some of the lowest mass stars .",
    "figure 6 shows the optical part of the spectrum compared with that of vb 10 and lp 944@xmath1020 , which were studied by kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "note the distinct absence in gliese 229b of any of the molecular absoprtion features due to refractory elements , such as vo and tio .",
    "also the steam feature is far deeper and more exaggerated in gliese 229b .",
    "in contrast to the stars , gliese 229b seems smooth blueward of the steam feature , with the exception of the two neutral cesium lines and a possible faint methane feature .",
    "( see  [ sec : ces ] and  [ sec : meth ] for a detailed discussion . )",
    "figure 7 compares gliese 229b s near ir spectrum with those of gd 165b and vb 10 again .",
    "the comparison spectra are reproduced here courtesy of h. r. a. jones and appeared in jones et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the huge swings in flux density in gliese 229b are not to be found in either star .",
    "in particular , this figure shows the great importance that methane has on gliese 229b s spectrum , causing drastic drops in the flux density at 1.6 @xmath2 m and 2.2 @xmath2 m .",
    "the water bands at 1.1 @xmath2 m and 1.4 @xmath2 m are also vastly deeper in gliese 229b than in the stars .",
    "more specifically , the water band at 1.4 @xmath2 m is about 2.5 times deeper in gliese 229b than it is in gd 165b . some of these differences may be magnified by the presence of dust in gd 165b and vb 10 .",
    "dust serves to smooth out spectra such as these , and it has recently come to light that dust is quite important in the spectra of some very low mass stars ( jones &  tsuji @xcite ) .",
    "( see  [ sec : dust ] . )",
    "interesting comparisons can be made of the gliese 229b spectrum with that of jupiter .",
    "although the spectrum of jupiter is due to reflected sunlight throughout the wavelengths discussed here , there exist many similarities .",
    "we discuss these in the sections below where appropriate .",
    "what follows is a detailed explanation of various aspects of gliese 229b which can be addressed with the data presented in this paper .",
    "our spectrum in the 3 @xmath2 m to 4 @xmath2 m region shows an extremely large absorption feature ( figure 4 ) . we attribute this to the fundamental methane absorption band , which has been observed in planets and moons in the solar system .",
    "noll ( @xcite ) detected an interesting spike in the spectrum of jupiter at 3.52 @xmath2 m .",
    "other researchers have also noticed this feature ( drossart et al .",
    "we do not see this feature in our spectrum of gliese 229b .",
    "drossart et al .",
    "( @xcite ) attribute this feature to reflected solar light emerging between what is actually two important methane features .",
    "the principal reason we can not comment on the presence of this feature in gliese 229b is that the signal to noise ratio in this part of the spectrum is exceedingly low .",
    "for that reason the depth of this band can not be determined from this data .    another formerly undetected band of methane presented here is the faint band in the 0.89 @xmath2 m region .",
    "this band , which is quite prominent in the reflectance spectra of jupiter , saturn , titan , uranus and neptune , has been shown by karkoschka ( @xcite ) to be strongly dependent upon the effective temperature .",
    "large differences in the depth of the band are apparent in the spectra he presents .",
    "this is important because the temperature dependence of the absorption coefficient for methane is poorly known .",
    "examination of the results in karkoschka ( @xcite ) show that this band should be extremely weak at high temperatures , such as the 900 k temperature of gliese 229b .",
    "thus , the weakness of this feature is expected .",
    "water is by far the most important source of non - continuum opacity in gliese 229b .",
    "( continuum opacity comes , as indicated by models , from h@xmath11 , h@xmath12 and h@xmath13 collision induced absorption ; burrows et al .",
    "@xcite . ) in models of gliese 229b , the absorption between the near ir filter bands ( which are naturally defined by telluric water absorption ) are broad and deep .",
    "this is highly beneficial .",
    "it means that the majority of the flux from gliese 229b and any similar objects , such as extrasolar giant planets , will pass through the earth s atmosphere ( matthews et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and that brown dwarf or extrasolar planet studies are not hindered by this telluric absorption .    geballe et al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed that the narrow features in the 2.0 @xmath2 m to 2.2 @xmath2 m region correspond closely to the opacity of water .",
    "saumon et al . (",
    "1996 ) have shown that a measurement of the surface gravity of gliese 229b could be made using these very fine water features .",
    "the optical spectrum ( figure 5 ) shows many narrow features redward of 0.925 @xmath2 m .",
    "these are essentially all real features and are a result of the complex structure of the water molecule ( f. allard , private communication ) .",
    "in principal one can conduct an analysis of these water features similar to that in meadows &  crisp ( @xcite ) , in which the thermal structure of the atmosphere of venus was deduced .",
    "however , this entails modelling of line profiles and spectral synthesis with detailed radiative transfer models , which our group is unable to do at present . unfortunately the models for venus can not be used because gliese 229b ( presumably ) has no rocky surface underlying its atmosphere . in the case of venus",
    ", the surface has a profound impact on the radiative processes in the atmosphere ( meadows &  crisp @xcite ) .",
    "the first vibration - rotation band ( 1 - 0 ) of co is centered near 4.7 @xmath2 m . motivated by a paper by fegley &  lodders ( @xcite ) , which discussed the importance of the detection of co , we measured the 3 @xmath2 m to 5 @xmath2 m spectrum of gliese 229b presented here . since then , the presence of co in the atmosphere of gliese 229b has been reported by noll et al .",
    "( @xcite ; hereafter ngm ) ngm , using spectral data in the 4.7 @xmath2 m region , claim to detect the expected increase in flux density in the center of the 1 - 0 vibration - rotation band .",
    "though the noise in their data was appreciable , the detection is clear and the model spectrum they generated agrees well with the data .",
    "our data confirm their result , as can be seen in figure 8 , where we have reproduced ngm s figure 2 ( courtesy of mark marley ) , showing their data and model , but with our data overdrawn .",
    "their model fits the observations best with a mole fraction , q , of qco = 200 ppm ( parts per million ) and a brown dwarf radius of @xmath14 km ( which affects the flux density as well as the model s adiabat ) .",

    ", one does not expect co to be present in the atmosphere of gliese 229b in thermochemical equilibrium .",

    "the qco / qch@xmath15 = 1 boundary is much deeper ( fegley & lodders @xcite ) .",
    "the only explanation for the presence of co in the photosphere of gliese 229b is that it is not in thermochemical equilibrium .",
    "this seems to require convection which would bring measurable quantities of co up from the deeper and warmer parts of the atmosphere .",
    "the convection need not necessarily reach all the way to 1400 k. even if it extended into the 1250 k region , substantial quantities of co could be pulled up into the outer atmosphere ( fegley &  lodders @xcite , fegley &  lodders @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that the outer convective region of gliese 229b is at least as deep as the 1250 k isothermal surface .",
    "recent models by burrows et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found that an object like gliese 229b has an outer radiative region , followed as one progesses inward by a thin convective region which spans a temperature range depending upon the mass and effective temperature .",
    "below this thin outer convective region lies another radiative region which extends in almost all of the models to a depth where the temperature is about 2000 k. inside this inner radiative region is a final convective region which reaches to the core of the brown dwarf .",
    "this concept of shells of alternating convective and radiative regions seems to be in agreement with the observations made here .",
    "the co might form easily in the outer convective shell , which can reach to temperatures of over 1250 k , and get dredged up to the observable part of the atmosphere . to make this more clear",
    ", one must consider the presence of dust in the spectrum of gliese 229b .",
    "the issue of dust in gliese 229b has been the subject of some discussion , particularly among the modellers of brown dwarf and planet atmospheres ( e. g. marley et al .",

    "the application of a detailed theory of the cloud microphysics ( such as appears in rossow @xcite ) may be possible .",
    "for now , we restrict ourselves to a somewhat more qualitative discussion .",
    "metallicity of gliese 229b is important to any discussion of its dust content . at this time we have no direct measurment of the metallicity of gliese 229b",

    "1997 ) , which are both consistent with solar metallicity ( within the errorbars ) .",
    "if gliese 229b formed the way planets are thought to form , out of a circumstellar disk surrounding the nascent gliese 229a , it may be that the metallicity of the brown dwarf is higher than that of its sun , as is the case for the outer planets of the solar system . in this case",
    ", one would expect to see even more dust ( burrows et al .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if gliese formed out of the collapse of an interstellar cloud , the way gliese 229a presumably formed , the metallicities should be identical .",
    "this is important because of the apparent lack of dust influences in the spectrum , as we discuss below .",
    "jones &  tsuji ( @xcite ) have demonstrated that dust plays an extremely important role in the spectra of the very lowest mass stars .",
    "looking at progressively cooler stars jones &  tsuji ( @xcite ) find that dust increases in importance past the spectral classification m6 .",
    "the evidence for this is that the prominent tio and vo bands that define late m type spectra suddenly seem to reduce in strength past the m6.5 v spectral type .",
    "this can not be reconciled with dust - free models of late type stars , which show increasing strengths of the tio and vo bands until the bottom of the main sequence ( allard &  hauschildt @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , tsuji et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have shown that gd 165b s spectrum can only be explained with the presence of large quantities of dust .",
    "it may be that past the m6.5 v spectral type stars do not all appear the same : some may be rather dusty , while others may not",
    ". this might be due to differences in metallicity and in details of the stars s weather patterns .",

    "for instance , the observed factor of 10 drop in flux density in the k band matches only the dust free models of tsuji et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the dusty models of tsuji et al .",
    "( @xcite ) show a pronounced dampening of this methane absorption band .",
    "the question that now arises is `` where is the dust that is expected to be present in the brown dwarf ? ''",
    "we see two possibilities .",
    "the first , suggested by tsuji et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , is that the lack of dust is only apparent ; the dust , which one expects from thermochemical considerations , is present but in clouds in the photosphere with a small covering fraction .",
    "this would presumably be an observably testable suggestion .",
    "one could look for variability in the absorption bands of gliese 229b . in the various spectral images we have taken at keck and palomar we found no evidence for variability greater than 10%  on time scales from several minutes to two days and over a one year baseline in the 1.6 @xmath2 m methane absorption band , the depths of which",
    "are easily detected in a single 40 second exposure on keck .",
    "whether the presence of clouds would produce a 10 %  or larger effect is not clear .",
    "however , this is probably a viable explanation .",
    "another possible reason for the lack of dust is that it sits deep within the atmosphere below the outer convective region in an inner radiative region ( first predicted in planets by guillot et al .",
    "@xcite , and predicted to exist in brown dwarfs by burrows et al .",
    "@xcite ) , so that it is not blown back up into the photosphere through convection .",
    "there are several points we can raise in support of this idea .",
    "we argued above (  [ sec : co ] ) in confirmation of noll et al .",
    "( @xcite ) that there is an appreciable quantity of co visible in the spectrum of gliese 229b , and that this is many orders of magnitude higher than the amount expected from thermochemical equilibrium .",
    "we further argued that this can be the result of convection in the brown dwarf s atmosphere .",
    "this seems to imply that the convective region of the brown dwarf must extend at least to a depth where co is abundant .",
    "fegley &  lodders ( @xcite ) showed that the co to ch@xmath15 phase transition ought to happen at around 1400 k and a pressure of about 10 bars in gliese 229b .",
    "as mentioned above , it is possible that the co we observe comes from a lower temperature where it exists but in smaller relative quantities .",
    "thus it could perhaps come from as low a temperature as 1250 k , where the mole fractions of co and ch@xmath18 differ by a factor of 10 .",
    "we already know , though , that the dust forms at much higher temperatures than this",
    ". by far the most abundant refractory elements are fe , mg , si and al .",
    "these form al@xmath13o@xmath19 ( corundum ) in the late m dwarf regime , fe clusters at 2000 k ( fegley &  lodders @xcite ) , and mgsio@xmath19 ( enstatite ) at 1600 k ( tsuji et al .",
    "@xcite , sharp &  huebner @xcite ) .",
    "this may indicate where the boundary between the outer convective and inner radiative regions of the brown dwarf are . specifically",
    ", the boundary must be at a temperature above 1250 k , to permit dredging of substantial quantities of co into the cooler regions , and yet cooler than 1600 k , where enstatite forms .",
    "if the outer convective region extends deeper and hotter than 1600 k then the condensation and falling or raining rate of enstatite must be much faster than the convective wind speed , so that the enstatite and other types of dust never reach the outer atmosphere .",
    "this process would be similar to the falling of rain droplets in the earth s convective and stormy atmosphere .",
    "rain falls despite the convection .",
    "presumably one could model this process to answer the question raised in this paragraph .",
    "if the dust is below the outer convective region in a radiative region , clouds are not needed to reconcile the observations with theory .    according to marley et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and marley ( @xcite ) , theoretical temperature versus pressure curves for gliese 229b show that the atmospheric structure becomes adiabatic at approximately 1600 k and 10 bars of pressure .",
    "this is consistent with our suggestion above , that the outer convective / inner radiative boundary is between 1250 k and 1600 k. it is also consistent with the new models by burrows et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "if this is true , then one would predict that objects at some temperature below the 1800 k of gd 165b will begin to show the effects of dust less and less . indeed , the expectation is that the much hotter brown dwarfs will exhibit dust in their spectrum .",
    "the possibly close proximity of the radiative - convective boundary in gliese 229b to the formation temperature for enstatite suggests that a brown dwarf even slightly hotter than gliese 229b might show some effects of dust in its spectrum . thus , one should see a progressive decrease in the importance of dust through the range of effective temperatures from 1800 k to 900 k. alternatively , below a certain temperature , the photosphere may become dust free .",
    "this could happen if convection is unable to bring the dust back into the photosphere because it just rains out of the convective region .",
    "it is entirely possible , however , that the type of internal structure we discuss here is largely model dependent .",
    "for example , additional , as - yet - unidentified opacity sources inside the brown dwarf atmosphere could upset or even drastically change the conclusions of the models that there are inner radiative and convective zones .    as a final note on the dust in gliese 229b , we remark upon the smooth - looking parts of the optical spectrum .",
    "this may be due to a haze of exotic types of dust not yet identified with extremely fine particle size , but this requires additional work on behalf of the modellers ( m. marley , f. allard , personal communication ) .",
    "of the alkali metals ( li , na , k , rb , cs and fr ) , only lithium , sodium , potassium and rubidium have been known to play an important role in low mass star spectra ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "@xcite ; basri &  marcy @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , tinney ( @xcite ) found cesium absorption lines in spectra of several very low - mass stars .",
    "this completes the set of alkali metals one would expect to find in such stars .",
    "the reason the alkali metals are important is that they have very low ionization potentials : from 5.390 ev for li to 3.893 ev for cs ( letokhov et al .",
    "@xcite ) . these are the lowest ionization potentials for any of the elements . as a result , in most stellar atmospheres they are ionized and",
    "would only be visible in an ultraviolet spectrum , a wavelength region never used to classify m dwarfs . as one considers stellar atmospheres of cooler and cooler temperatures , the neutral alkalis begin to appear , with cs appearing only in the very coolest atmospheres . continuing this progression through cooler atmospheres , as one crosses into the brown dwarf regime , these metals should begin to form molecules .",
    "thus , they would again disappear from the optical to near ir spectra .    in the case of gliese 229b",
    ", the two strongest cesium lines are present .",
    "( see figure 5 . )",
    "the other alkali metals have their strongest lines blueward of the shortest wavelength we were able to measure .",
    "( li is at 670.8 nm and 812.6 nm ; na is at 589.5 nm and 589.0 nm ; k is at 769.9 nm and 766.5 nm and rb is at 794.8 nm and 780.0 nm . )",
    "unfortunately we are unable to use the lines for a reliable calculation of the abundance of cesium in gliese 229b .",
    "this is beacuse there exist to date no curve of growth models for these absorption lines .",
    "the cesium lines present in the optical region of the spectrum of gliese 229b comprise the principal doublet of cesium .",
    "the line at 852.1 nm corresponds to a transition of the solitary valence electron from the 6 @xmath20s@xmath21 state to the 6 @xmath20p@xmath22 state .",
    "the other line at 894.3 nm corresponds to the transition from 6 @xmath20s@xmath21 to 6 @xmath20p@xmath21 .",
    "( this notation follows the standard spectroscopic notation convention , @xmath23 . )",
    "kirkpatrick ( private communication ) has found the same two cesium lines in a new spectrum of gd 165b , as well .",
    "these are by far the strongest lines of cesium .",
    "the next strongest line at 917.2 nm is several times weaker than either of these and is not visible in gliese 229b .",
    "an important question to answer is `` at what temperatures can we expect these alkali metals to form molecules ? ''",
    "this question , which requires thermochemical equilibrium calculations , has been thoroughly addressed for planet sized objects like jupiter by fegley &  lodders ( @xcite ) .",
    "their thermochemical equilibrium calculations would lead one to believe that none of the alkali metals should be visible in the spectrum of jupiter , because they ought to have formed molecules already .",
    "indeed , in jupiter , one expects cscl to dominate over cs even at temperatures as high as 2000 k. ( the brightness temperature in the region of the cs lines in gliese 229b is approximately 1300 k. ) however , it is not entirely correct to use the calculations for jupiter when discussing gliese 229b .",
    "the adiabat for gliese 229b places a given temperature at a substantially lower pressure .",
    "a. burrows ( personal communication ) believes that the turn over from cs to cscl in gliese 229b happens around 1500k .",
    "however , until the full calculations are carried out , reconciling the theory with this detection of atomic cs can not happen .",
    "it is possible that one merely expects the deep cs lines we see , but if they are not compatible with thermochemical equilibrium , it is possible that some quantity of cs is being convected into the observable atmosphere much the way the co is , as we described in ",
    "[ sec : co ] .",
    "the thermochemical quilibrium calculations could also lead to an important temperature diagnostic for brown dwarfs and very low - mass stars . by observing which",
    "alkali metals exist in atomic form , one could determine the temperature of a given object through comparison with the thermochemical equilibrium calculations .",
    "these considerations also have implications for the so - called lithium test for brown dwarfs .",
    "it may be that the lithium test , in which one attempts to detect atomic lithium in the candidate brown dwarf ( rebolo et al .",
    "@xcite ; magazz et al .",
    "@xcite ) , might only be meaningful for the highest temperature brown dwarfs .",
    "the temperature at which lithium becomes lioh determines this . for the case of the jupiter adiabat ,",
    "this is well above 2000 k ( fegley &  lodders @xcite ) .",
    "the field would benefit from new thermochemical equilibrium calculations using the adiabats found for gliese 229b ( marley et al .",
