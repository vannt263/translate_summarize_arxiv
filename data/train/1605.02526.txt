    "recent developments in hydrogen storage and retrieval techniques for energy technology @xcite and for mobile applications @xcite underline the need for simple , precise and generally applicable techniques for the determination of the hydrogen content in a material .",
    "there are several different nuclear physics based techniques available to determine and profile hydrogen @xcite .",
    "this range of techniques exist both because of the low coloumb barrier generally favoring any light ion induced nuclear reaction with hydrogen , and because the control and determination of the hydrogen content of metals is one of the earliest and most pervasive problems in nuclear technology @xcite .    among the various nuclear physical techniques available @xcite",
    ", nrra by the @xmath0h(@xmath1n,@xmath2)@xmath3c resonance at 6.4mev is a preferred choice .",
    "this reaction combines high sensitivity ( down to hydrogen concentrations of @xmath6@xmath7 for bulk materials ) with excellent depth resolution down to a few nm near surfaces @xcite .",
    "in addition , it enables the study of hydrogen not only near the surface , but up to @xmath8 deep in the bulk @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath0h(@xmath1n,@xmath2)@xmath3c nrra hitherto requires the comparison of the sample under study with a standard of known hydrogen concentration @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen content was given by the ratio of reaction yields of the sample under study and the standard , respectively , multiplied with the hydrogen content of the sample which was determined by other means .",
    "the aim of the present work is to go one step further and enable the use of the 6.4mev @xmath1n resonance as an absolute tool for hydrogen depth profiling . to this end , the discrepant ,",
    "60 year old data on the @xmath4-ray angular distribution @xcite are addressed with a precise new measurement .",
    "in addition , previous information on the resonance strength that depended on measurements at just one angle @xcite or on indirect methods @xcite are replaced here with data taken in far geometry at three different angles .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "first , the yield formulae for resonant nuclear reaction analyses are reviewed ( sec.[sec : theory ] ) .",
    "then , the angular distribution of the emitted @xmath4-rays from the resonance in the @xmath0h(@xmath1n,@xmath2)@xmath3c reaction at 6.4mev @xmath1n beam energy is re - determined experimentally , both with @xmath1n and with @xmath0h beam ( sec.[sec : angdist ] ) .",
    "subsequently , the new angular distribution is used to re - evaluate the strength of the resonance ( sec.[sec : strength ] ) .",
    "the formulae from sec.[sec : theory ] and the data from secs.[sec : angdist ] and [ sec : strength ] are then used to determine a simple working formula for hydrogen depth profiling ( sec.[sec : formula ] ) .",
    "finally , the new formula is applied to an example ( sec.[sec : examples ] ) , and a summary is given ( sec.[sec : summary ] ) .",
    "for energetically narrow resonances , i.e. @xmath9 , it can be shown @xcite that the maximum resonant yield is given by @xmath10 with @xmath11 the de broglie wavelength ( in the center of mass system ) of the incident particle at the resonance energy , @xmath12 the so - called resonance strength @xcite , and @xmath13 the energy loss ( stopping power ) per disintegrable nucleus in the target per area in the units of ev/(at/@xmath14 ) , also in the center - of - mass system .    for a material consisting of additional atoms @xmath15 in addition to h atoms , the effective stopping power for a @xmath1n beam is given by @xmath16\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath17 and @xmath18 the atomic masses of hydrogen and @xmath1n , @xmath19 and @xmath20 the atomic concentrations of h and of the additional atoms @xmath15 , and @xmath21 the stopping power of a @xmath1n ion by atom @xmath15 .",
    "the simple addition of the stopping powers of the various atoms performed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : effstoppingpowercm ] ) is appropriate whenever bragg s rule @xcite holds . for incident hydrogen and helium ions on organic materials , corrections to bragg s rule",
    "do apply @xcite , and they may be dealt with by the core - and - bond approach @xcite . the same is true for @xmath22li , @xmath3c , and @xmath23o ions in polymer foils @xcite .",
    "an early comprehensive review of stopping in inorganic materials showed no deviations from bragg s rule within a few percent precision @xcite .",
    "more recent research on these cases either confirm bragg s rule within @xmath54% @xcite or show deviations of up to 7% @xcite .    for the present hydrogen depth determination in inorganic materials , it is assumed that bragg s rule holds .",
    "in addition , it is assumed that the srim @xcite stopping powers for @xmath1n ions are correct @xcite .",
    "the sought - after hydrogen concentration @xmath19 may be obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : effstoppingpowercm ] ) for @xmath19 and inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxyieldiliadis ] ) : @xmath24    the stopping by the hydrogen atoms @xmath25 , included in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hydrogenconc ] ) , can be neglected for small concentrations @xmath19 , more precisely for the case    @xmath26    if this approximation holds , the hydrogen concentration is directly proportional to the observed yield in nrra , and it can be obtained by simply rescaling with the observed yield for a standard of known hydrogen concentration :    @xmath27    this is the formula given in most recent textbooks and reviews @xcite , which concentrate on low hydrogen concentrations .",
    "however , for high hydrogen concentrations , when approximation ( [ eq : lowhydrogencontent ] ) is not valid , the simplified formula ( [ eq : proportionality ] ) leads to deviations , e.g. for tih@xmath28 an underestimation of the true hydrogen content by 27% .",
    "this problem may be mitigated by using a standard with a hydrogen concentration that is similar to the hydrogen concentration of the sample under study .",
    "even still , keeping the same example of titanium hydride , determining the hydrogen content of a tih@xmath29 sample using a tih@xmath30 standard and the simplified eq .",
    "( [ eq : proportionality ] ) would lead to 6% underestimation of the hydrogen amount in the sample .",
    "the effect increases for larger deviations between sample and standard and decreases for higher atomic charge numbers of the hydrogen carrier .      in nrra",
    ", the hydrogen content is determined as a function of @xmath1n beam energy @xmath31 , where higher beam energies correspond to deeper layers in the material .",
    "this beam energy scale may be then converted to a depth @xmath32 by    @xmath33    where , again , the denominator has to be adapted in case of corrections to bragg s rule .    in the following sections [ sec : angdist ] and [ sec : strength ] , the necessary input parameters for hydrogen concentration analysis are derived from new experimental data .",
    "these values and tabulated stopping powers are used in sec.[sec : formula ] to propose a simple working formula for hydrogen depth profiling , obviating the need for the problematic approximations inherent in eq .",
    "( [ eq : proportionality ] ) . in section [ sec : examples ] , a quantitative example is given , including the error analysis .",
    "the 2@xmath34 level at @xmath35 = 12530kev excitation energy in @xmath23o can be conveniently accessed in two different ways : first , bombarding a hydrogen target with a @xmath1n beam of @xmath36(@xmath1n ) = 6.4mev , and second , using a @xmath37h beam of @xmath36(@xmath37h ) = 0.430mev incident on a @xmath1n target .",
    "the resonance decays predominantly by emission of an @xmath38-particle to the @xmath35 = 4439kev first excited state of @xmath3c ( @xmath39 = 4@xmath4010@xmath41s ) , which then decays to the ground state by emitting a 4.4mev @xmath4-ray .",
    "the @xmath3c@xmath42(4439 ) momentum distribution resulting from the @xmath38-particle recoil leads to an unavoidable doppler broadening of the observed @xmath4-ray .",
    "nrra using the @xmath36(@xmath1n ) = 6.4mev resonance has been introduced in the 1970s @xcite .",
    "it gained wide popularity after it was shown that the total energetic width of the resonance is well below 1kev , enabling excellent resolution in depth when determining a hydrogen profile @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of the emitted @xmath4 rays by the @xmath0h(@xmath1n,@xmath2)@xmath3c resonance has been measured in two different experiments in the early 1950s @xcite .",
    "those experiments used a @xmath0h beam and solid targets with isotopically enriched @xmath1n to populate the resonance .",
    "scintillation detectors covering an opening angle of 30@xmath43 and 36@xmath43 , respectively , were used @xcite , and the angular corrections by these two works differ by up to 13% .",
    "the only measurement of the angular distribution with a @xmath1n beam gives no experimental details and reports the results only in graphical form @xcite .    in light of the differences between refs .",

    "the beam from the tandetron , after being bent by 10@xmath46 , successively passes electrostatic quadrupoles and horizontal and vertical deflector units before entering the target chamber ( fig.[fig_setup ] ) .",
    "there , about 30 - 50% of the beam current are absorbed on a water - cooled collimator with an opening of 5 mm diameter .",
    "the beam then passes a 30 mm long copper tube , negatively biased for secondary electron suppression , that extends to within 2 mm of the target surface ( fig.[fig_setup ] ) .",

    "the distance between target center and end cap of the detector was 30 cm .",
    "altogether 12 angles and one reference angle were covered by arranging the detectors in three configurations called a , b , and c , respectively ( fig.[fig_setup ] , table  [ tab_setup ] ) .    four @xmath54 lanthanum bromide ( labr@xmath48 , cerium doped , trade name brillance 380 ) scintillation detectors , one @xmath55 labr@xmath48 , and one high - purity germanium ( hpge ) detector of 100% relative @xcite efficiency were used , covering an opening angle of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath54 labr@xmath48 scintillators were read out by hamamatsu r11973 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , the @xmath55 by a hamamatsu r2038 pmt .",

    "the positions of the other detectors are given in table  [ tab_setup ] .",
    "all angles are given in the laboratory system , with respect to the direction of travel of the beam .",
    "two different data acquisition ( daq ) systems were used : for the labr@xmath48 detectors , the signals from the pmt anodes were split and the resulting two branches connected to a caen v965 charge - to - digital - converter ( qdc ) and a constant fraction discriminator ( cfd ) , respectively . the trigger and the conversion gate for the qdc",
    "were generated in a caen v1495 field programmable gate array ( fpga ) from the logical or of the five cfd outputs .",
    "the dead time of the labr@xmath48 daq system was estimated from the accepted - trigger to trigger ratio to be 2% .    due to the high light yield of the innovative labr@xmath59 scintillator @xcite and the large efficiency of the pmts used , saturation effects changed the pmt gain for @xmath4-ray energies above 3mev .",
    "for the graphical representation the pulse height data were thus re - calibrated and re - sampled to give a linear gain .",
    "for the hpge detector , the energy signals were amplified and shaped using an ortec 671 spectroscopic amplifier and digitized and recorded using a histogramming ortec 919e analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) and multichannel buffer unit .",

    "it is important to precisely know the @xmath4-ray detection efficiency .",
    "therefore , instead of using calculated efficiency values with their inherent uncertainties , here a different approach is adopted @xcite .",
    "using calibrated radioisotope sources and nuclear reactions , the @xmath4-ray detection efficiency is obtained up to 10.76mev directly from experimental data . as a first step ,",
    "the full energy peak detection efficiency was determined using @xmath60co , @xmath61mn , and @xmath62y activity standards with an activity uncertainty of 0.5%-1.0% . in order to extend the curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig_efficiency ] ) to higher energies , in a second step the @xmath63kev resonance of the @xmath64al(p,@xmath4)@xmath65si reaction was used .",

    "the positions were kept the same in configurations b and c , in order to check the reproducibility of the efficiency curve ( fig .",

    "several example efficiency curves are shown in fig.[fig_efficiency ] , showing generally similar slopes .",

    ", the curve has a different shape due to a high amount of passive material ( @xmath686 cm of water , aluminium , and stainless steel ) passed by the @xmath4-rays .",
    "the resulting 4439kev efficiency from the parametric fit of the data at higher and lower @xmath4-ray energies has 3% uncertainty for the @xmath66 detectors and up to 11% uncertainty , depending on the configuration , for the @xmath67 labr@xmath48 . for the hpge detector with its better energy resolution",
    ", additional @xmath64al(p,@xmath4)@xmath65si lines could be used , and the efficiency uncertainty was 2% for configurations a and b and 8% for configuration c , where the @xmath64al(p,@xmath4)@xmath65si spectrum was accidentally overwritten .      as a first step , for a given beam ( @xmath1n or @xmath37h ) ,",
    "the beam energy was set to the top of the yield curve , @xmath69 = 6.6mev and @xmath70 = 0.462mev , respectively .",
    "then , irradiations were performed subsequently in the three configurations a , b , and c. the beam current on target was 0.7 - 1.8@xmath71a for @xmath1n@xmath45 ( corrected for secondary electron effects ) and 4 - 6 @xmath71a for @xmath0h@xmath72 .",
    "the yields from the three configurations are connected to each other by normalizing to the yield of the detector at -90@xmath43 that was kept at the same position throughout the experiment .",
    "possible degradations in the target under the intense ion beam bombardment therefore affect the yield of the reference detector and the yield at the angle under study by exactly the same factor .",
    "indeed it was found that the hydrogen implanted zr target showed a 23% decrease of the yield at -90@xmath43 over the course of the experiment .",
    "because of the normalization to the -90@xmath43 detector , this decrease does not affect the results .",

    "the tin target , instead , remained stable under bombardment .",
    "the observed @xmath4-ray spectra in the hpge detector show no significant beam - induced lines except for the ones from the reaction under study ( fig.[fig_spectra ] ) . the observed @xmath4-ray energy at the 55@xmath43 forward angle subtended by the hpge in configuration b is higher in the @xmath1n beam case than for @xmath37h beam .",
    "this is due to the higher doppler shift because of the higher velocity of the center of mass for @xmath1n beam . for the same reason ,",
    "the doppler broadening of the peak is larger .",
    "the labr@xmath59 detectors show the same general picture as the hpge ( fig.[fig_spectra ] )",
    ". however , the labr@xmath59 energy resolution is lower than for hpge , as expected .    for the analysis of the angular distribution , only the full energy peaks were used .",
    "the laboratory background was subtracted , scaled for equal livetime .",
    "the statistical uncertainty of the resultant @xmath4-yield was 1 - 5% for the @xmath66 labr@xmath48 , 2 - 12% for the smaller @xmath67 detector , and up to 3% for the hpge .",
    "the 4439kev yields , after normalization by the @xmath73 detector to one common scale given by configuration a , were plotted together ( fig.[fig_ang_dist ] ) .",
    "the y axis error bars in fig.[fig_ang_dist ] reflect the statistical uncertainty , the efficiency error , and the statistical uncertainty of the -90@xmath43 normalization .",
    "the x axis error bars correspond to @xmath74 of the full angle subtended by the detector crystals , i.e. for the purpose of the fit it is assumed that the full angle corresponds to 92% coverage for a normal distribution .",

    "then , the arbitrary normalization is included in parameter @xmath78 .    in a second step , for each of the two kinematics @xmath78",

    "the present result is less prone to systematic errors than these previous works @xcite and should be recommended for further use .",
    "for the purposes of hydrogen depth profiling compared to a standard , it is sufficient to know that the cross section on top of the resonance is much larger than the off - resonant cross section , i.e. the ratio of resonant to off - resonant cross section .",

    ", an additional uncertainty has to be taken into account .",
    "two examples show that this approach can yield hydrogen profiles with 8 - 10% systematic uncertainty , depending on the actual hydrogen concentration .",
    "this absolute error bar is higher than the 2% reproducibility which has been reported previously in an intercomparison exercise involving a low concentration sample @xcite .",
    "it is mainly due to the remaining uncertainty in the resonance strength and in the stopping power .",
    "even still , it is hoped that these data and considerations prove to be useful for cases of high hydrogen concentrations and wherever the use of standards is difficult .",
