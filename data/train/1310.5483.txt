    "the study of nims has attracted a lot the attention of the scientific community thanks to their many possible applications .",

    "the assumption on the cloaked region by all means imposes no restriction since any bounded set is a subset of such a region provided that the radius and the origin are appropriately chosen . the idea suggested by lai et al . in @xcite ( for two dimensions ) is to construct a complementary medium of @xmath2 in @xmath8 for some @xmath9 .",
