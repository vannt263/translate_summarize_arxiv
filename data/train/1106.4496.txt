    "in the study of correlations present in quantum states two different approaches are nowadays typically distinguished : one is based on the entanglement - versus - separability paradigm and the other on a quantum - classical dichotomy.@xcite in the entanglement - separability paradigm introduced by werner@xcite , the state of a multipartite system is named separable if it can be represented as a mixture convex combination of product states relative to the various parts of the total system , otherwise , it is termed entangled .",
    "entanglement is considered a key ingredient in the increased efficiency of quantum computing compared to classical computation for certain quantum algorithms and thus it plays a central role in quantum information and communication.@xcite    however , entanglement does not exhaust the realm of quantum correlations .",
    "a quantum state of a composed system may contain other types of nonclassical correlation even if it is separable.@xcite in the framework of quantum - classical dichotomy , the total correlations present in the system can be separated in a purely quantum part and a classical part .",
    "a measure of quantum correlations is the quantum discord.@xcite a mixed bipartite separable state with nonzero quantum discord may yet be exploited in quantum computation protocols.@xcite an intense research activity has been dedicated to the characterization of quantum discord for several classes of both bipartite@xcite and multipartite@xcite quantum states , even in the case of continuous variable systems@xcite .",
    "an experimental observation of the quantum discord in nuclear magnetic resonance quadrupolar system was recently reported.@xcite    the dynamics of entanglement for bipartite quantum systems interacting with independent or common environments , either markovian or non - markovian , with the appearance of phenomena like sudden death@xcite , revivals@xcite or trapping@xcite , can be considered well understood in its general lines .",
    "dynamics of quantum discord has also received much attention for two - qubit systems in the presence of both markovian@xcite and non - markovian@xcite environments .",
    "interestingly , differently from entanglement , markovian evolution can never lead to a sudden death of discord .",
    "quantum discord does result in fact to be more robust than the entanglement against decoherence . in some cases , in front of a decay of total correlations ,",
    "classical and quantum correlations may present finite time intervals when each of them remains constant.@xcite    recently , the transfer of entanglement between the parties of a composed system has been analyzed in several investigations.@xcite when two initially correlated atoms are placed in two noninteracting leaky cavities , each connected to its own reservoir , it has been found that entanglement can be transferred from atoms to reservoirs via the cavities.@xcite in this case , different regimes have been shown to exist and in particular , under certain conditions , the cavities do not become entangled during the dynamics .",
    "the reverse problem of entanglement transfer from radiation modes to qubits through cavities has been also investigated , finding the conditions for exchange of quantum correlations among the subsystems.@xcite here , we investigate the conditions for transfer of quantum correlations from qubits inside cavities to outside systems . in view of exploiting quantum discord , in this paper",
    "we analyze how it can be extracted for this kind of systems .",

    "the hamiltonian of the total system is thus given by the sum of the hamiltonians of the two noninteracting subsystems @xmath6 in each subsystem , we distinguish the two - partite system of interest @xmath7 made by the qubit plus the cavity from the reservoir @xmath8 made by the external bosonic modes .",

    "being the two subsystems noninteracting , they evolve independently so that we can analyze the dynamics of only one subsystem and use it to obtain the evolution of the global six - partite system .",
    "we will consider initial states such that , in each subsystem , only a single excitation is initially present in the qubit .",

    "as said before , entanglement does not necessarily exhaust all quantum correlations present in a state .",

    "on the other hand , the classical part of correlations is defined as the maximum information about one subsystem that can be obtained by performing a measurement on the other system .",
    "given a set of projective ( von neumann ) measurements described by a complete set of orthogonal projectors @xmath45 and locally performed only on system @xmath40 , the information about @xmath39 is the difference between the initial entropy of @xmath39 and the conditional entropy , that is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 $ ] , @xmath48 is the probability of the measurement outcome @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the identity operator for subsystem @xmath39 . to ensure that one captures all classical correlations",

    "these quantities can be either directly measured by photodetectors or used to know the amount of quantum correlations transmittable to other distant quantum systems .",
    "the approach here adopted allows us to follow how the two independent single - mode cavities mediate the flow of correlations from the atoms to the external environment and the building of quantum correlations between the cavities themselves . following the above argument",
