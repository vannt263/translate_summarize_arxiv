    "recently , the deep imaging surveys by @xmath4 class telescopes with narrow - band filter have effectively revealed the properties of ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) , which are one class of high redshift objects @xcite .",
    "based on the observational results , it is inferred that laes have smaller sizes , much less dust , and a smaller amount of stellar component than the other class of high redshift galaxies , e.g. , lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at same redshifts @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of observed laes generally shows large filamentary structure @xcite . however , as pointed out by @xcite recently , the observed properties of laes such as weak angular correlation function ( acf ) are not explained well by a standard biased galaxy formation scenario in the context of @xmath5 cold dark matter ( @xmath5cdm ) cosmology .",
    "especially , the large - scale structure of laes found by @xcite is difficult to reproduce .",
    "the large - scale structure shows belt - like structure rather than filamentary structure , and may correspond to @xmath6 density fluctuation if it follows underlying dark matter distribution @xcite .",
    "acf is significantly weaker than that predicted in a conventional biased galaxy formation model ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , acf becomes negative at small scale of @xmath7  arcsec ( @xmath8  mpc ) in high density regions ( hdr ) @xcite .",
    "hence , the observational features of spatial distribution of laes appear to be incompatible with the standard biased galaxy formation model .    from a theoretical point of view , it is recently argued that laes corresponds to an early chemodynamical evolution phase of primordial galaxies @xcite . in an ultra high resolution",
    "simulation on the dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxy by @xcite , it is shown that multiple supernova explosions at an early phase of @xmath9  yr result in forming high density cooling shells , which emit so strong ly@xmath0 as to account for the luminosity of laes .",
    "however , it has not been argued whether this picture of laes is consistent with the observation .    in this letter",
    ", the spatial distributions of laes are simulated by taking into account the lifetime of the emitters , which has not been thitherto considered in the standard biased galaxy formation scenario @xcite .",
    "then , we investigate whether the picture of short - lived laes can explain the clustering properties of laes found by @xcite . in  2 , we describe the basic picture and numerical method . in  3 ,",
    "the results are presented with some discussion .",
    " 4 is devoted to the summary . throughout this letter",
    ", we adopt @xmath5cdm cosmology with the matter density @xmath10 , the cosmological constant @xmath11 , the hubble constant @xmath12 in units of @xmath13 , the baryon density @xmath14 , and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "in fig . [ gainen ] , the schematic picture of the present galaxy formation model is presented . in the context of a conventional biased galaxy formation model , density peaks with the amplitude which exceeds a minimum threshold value ( @xmath16 in fig .",
    "[ gainen ] ) in the linear regime are identified as galaxies . in other words ,",
    "only this threshold of fluctuations has been discussed as a parameter of biased galaxy formation @xcite . here , we introduce an additional criterion with postulating that laes evolve to galaxies with no strong ly@xmath0 emission after their short lifetime .",
    "more specifically , we take following assumption for laes : ( i ) laes are galactic objects that form at peaks of density fluctuations .",
    "( ii ) laes are in the phase of their first starbursts .",
    "( iii ) chemical evolution of laes results in strong attenuation of ly@xmath0 emission due to the increase of dust , and therefore can not be observed as laes after their lifetime .",
    "we incorporate this picture by setting a maximum threshold of density fluctuations ( @xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ gainen ] ) .",
    "then , we regard the fluctuations between @xmath16 and @xmath17 as laes ( a shaded region in fig .",
    "[ gainen ] ) .",
    "the growth time from @xmath16 to @xmath17 corresponds to the lifetime of laes .",
    "for instance , peak a in fig .",
    "[ gainen ] is the evolved galaxy that can not be observed as laes because of exceeding @xmath17 at the redshift .",
    "peaks b and d can be observed as laes .",
    "peak d is the oldest lae .      to compare our model with the observed clustering properties of laes @xcite",
    ", we numerically generate lae distributions , and estimate the two - point angular correlation function by following procedures .",
    "it is assumed that the dynamical evolution of baryonic matter follows that of dark matter .",
    "density fields of dark matter are created by generating random gaussian density fields , and the dynamical evolution is represented by truncated zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "this approximation traces the growth of density fluctuations in the linear regime , and truncate nonlinear growth by suppressing the amplitude of density fluctuations that becomes nonlinear . in the present simulation , we use @xmath18-space gaussian window @xmath19 as truncation , where @xmath20 corresponds to the scale that just enters nonlinear stage at a redshift @xmath21 .",
    "the truncated power spectrum of density fluctuation at @xmath21 , @xmath22 , is written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the power spectrum of density fluctuations at @xmath21 .",
    "the wavenumber @xmath25 and real scale @xmath26 have the relation of @xmath27 .    according to the @xmath5cdm theory ,",
    "the physical size of 1@xmath28 density fluctuation that collapses just at @xmath29 is about @xmath30 . in this study , we consider density fluctuations down to this physical size . in order to directly compare our model with the lae data in the comoving volume of @xmath31 @xcite",
    ", we simulate the same comoving volume with @xmath32 grids .",
    "the whole simulation box contains @xmath33 in dark matter component , and each cell is @xmath34 and has @xmath35 on average .",
    "next , we make coarse - graining of density fields by comoving volume of @xmath36 which corresponds to the physical size of interest .",
    "each coarse - grained cell has @xmath37 in dark matter on average .",
    "the coarse - grained cells that satisfy the density fluctuation criterion , @xmath38 , are regarded as laes .",
    "the positions are assumed to be the center of mass in coarse - grained cell .",
    "we choose several combinations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "a set of @xmath16 and @xmath17 is constrained so that the number of simulated laes should match the observed number of laes at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , if @xmath16 is set , then @xmath17 is determined from the constraint of the number of laes . in the linear regime , only density fluctuations with @xmath39 corresponds to collapsed objects @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider @xmath16 larger than 1.7 .",
    "resultant three - dimensional distributions of laes are projected into a two - dimensional plane to compare observed angular distributions .      to calculate the two - point acf of the simulated spatial distribution of laes",
    ", we use a following well - known estimator , @xmath40 @xcite , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the mean surface number density of simulated laes and that of randomly distributed points ( rdps ) , respectively .",
    "rdps are distributed over the same area as laes .",
    "@xmath43 is the averaged pair number of laes in a range of @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the averaged pair number between laes and rdps in a range of @xmath44 . to raise the precision of statistics , we calculate acfs for 30 different realizations of density fluctuations and average them",
    "then , the error on @xmath46 is defined by the standard deviation of acfs .",
    "in fig . [ ld ] , the spatial distributions of simulated laes are shown for different values of @xmath16 .",
    "the contours depict ` high density region ' ( hdr ) defined under the same condition as @xcite , where the number density smoothed with a gaussian kernel of @xmath47 ( corresponding to @xmath48 ) is equal to the mean number density in the entire field .",
    "the left panel in fig .",
    "[ ld ] is the model with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and the middle panel is the model with @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in the right panel ,",
    "a conventional biased galaxy formation model is shown , where @xmath53 is assumed and all fluctuations with @xmath54 are regarded as laes . in all these panels , we can recognize large - scale structures , but the clustering manners are somewhat different .",
    "the spatial distributions in the biased galaxy formation model exhibit very strong contrast and their clustered regions are fairly isolated . on the other hand , the distributions for @xmath55 or @xmath56",
    "appear to be belt - like and less clustered , similar to the observed spatial distribution of laes @xcite .    in order to quantify the difference in spatial distributions",
    ", we calculate acfs . in fig .",
    "[ acf ] , the resultant acfs for all the model are presented .",
    "also , the acf for laes observed in ssa22a field @xcite is shown .",
    "the upper and the lower panels show the acf in the whole region and that in hdr , respectively .",
    "the results show different behaviors on scales smaller than @xmath57 .",
    "the biased galaxy formation model shows strong correlation on small scales as expected in a standard biased model @xcite , and obviously does not match the acf of observed laes in ssa22a field .",
    "furthermore , the model with @xmath58 results in slightly stronger acf than the observation .",
    "the model with @xmath55 remarkably agrees with the acf of laes in ssa22a field . in the hdr ,",
    "the acf exhibits negative correlation in the same way as the observation .",
    "the reduction of acf for smaller @xmath16 is understood as follows . in the random gaussian density fields in a @xmath5cdm universe ,",
    "higher density peaks are more clustered , while lower density peaks are located in less dense regions surrounding highest density regions .",
    "thus , if small @xmath16 is adopted and highest peaks are cut by @xmath17 , the objects of interest are located in less dense regions and accordingly the amplitude of acf becomes smaller .",
    "hence , the result that the model with @xmath55 reproduces the observed acf implies that laes at @xmath1 do not reside in highest density peaks , but are located in less dense regions .",
    "observationally , laes have been discovered around known overdensities that generally indicate strong correlation such as proto - cluster region including massive galaxies such as radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "the observed overdensities may correspond to the situation shown in the right pane of fig .",
    "[ ld ] , and the observed laes correspond to the left panel of fig .",
    "[ ld ] . in that sense ,",
    "the results here look consistent with these observational features .",
    "hence , the picture in this paper can explain not only a correlation function but also other clustering properties of laes such as the morphology of hdr and the environment where laes at @xmath59 is discovered . according to the recent large survey such as sdss , acfs of late - type galaxies",
    "show weaker correlation compared with that of early - type galaxies at @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "that is to say , as well known , late - type galaxies are located at lower density fields .",
    "as shown here , laes at @xmath1 should be located in less dense regions .",
    "hence , it is suggested that a large fraction of laes at @xmath1 may be the precursors of late - type galaxies .      as shown above , @xmath49 gives the best fit model to account the observed acf . since @xmath61 is a critical amplitude for a fluctuation to collapse @xcite",
    ", we can conclude that laes begin to shine just after the collapse .",
    "in other words , laes should be in the first phase of galaxy evolution . since the model with @xmath55 agrees with the observed acf at @xmath29 , laes are thought to shine during the growth time from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "the fluctuation with @xmath17 at @xmath29 collapses at a higher redshift @xmath62 when the amplitude exceeds @xmath16 .",
    "hence , the lifetime of laes can be assessed by the cosmic time between @xmath29 and @xmath62 , which is @xmath63  yr . here , there is a small uncertainty in this estimation .",
    "when @xmath16 is chosen , @xmath17 is determined to match the number of observed laes . since we generate random numbers to produce density fluctuations , a different set of random numbers results in slight difference in @xmath17 . for the model of @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 as a result of 30 different realizations .",
    "then , the lifetime of laes is estimated to be @xmath2  yr .",
    "similarly , for the model of @xmath66 , we have @xmath67 .",
    "then , the lifetime is slightly longer as @xmath68  yr .",
    "this result on lae lifetime nicely agrees with an upper limit that is argued by realistic numerical simulations for galactic evolution @xcite .",
    "we also calculate ly@xmath0 luminosities of simulated laes , using an evolutionary spectral synthesis code pegase @xcite . as a result",
    ", we have found that evaluated ly@xmath0 luminosities match those of observed laes ( @xmath69 ) @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "density fields are coarse - grained by a scale of @xmath70 which corresponds to 1@xmath28 density fluctuations in the @xmath5cdm cosmology .",
    "if a smaller scale is taken , intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosities fall short of @xmath71 during ly@xmath0 bright phase .",
    "for instance , if a coarse - graining scale is @xmath72mpc , intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosities are @xmath73 . on the other hand , if a scale larger than @xmath70 is taken , the number of collapsed objects is not enough to accout for the observed lae number .",
    "hence , 1@xmath28 density fluctuations are favorable to explain the observations .      by assuming the best fit model ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 )",
    ", we can predict acfs of laes at higher redshifts . in fig .",
    "[ zc ] , the prediction of acfs at redshifts of 3.1 , 4.0 , 5.0 , and 6.0 are presented .",
    "a biased galaxy formation model is also presented , where the number of objects is scaled as to be the same as that in the best fit model .",
    "@xmath16 of biased galaxy formation model in each redshift is @xmath75 at @xmath76 , @xmath77 at @xmath78 , and @xmath79 at @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "as seen in this figure , the acf of best fit model approaches to that of biased galaxy formation model at higher redshifts .",
    "in other words , a larger fraction of collapsed objects shine as laes at higher redshifts .",
    "but , it is worth noting that there is still noticeable difference between the best fit model and a biased galaxy formation model even at @xmath80 .",
    "it implies that a certain fraction has been already extinguished , so that they are not detected as laes .",
    "to account for the recently discovered large - scale structure of laes at @xmath1 @xcite , we have introduced a novel picture for laes by focusing on the lifetime of emitters .",
    "we have simulated the spatial distributions of collapsed objects by generating random gaussian fluctuations based on the truncated zeldovich approximation in the @xmath5cdm cosmology .",
    "we have found that a conventional biased galaxy formation model is not reconciled with the observed correlation function of laes .",
    "if highest peaks above @xmath81 are cut and mild peaks between @xmath82 and @xmath81 are regarded as laes , the clustering properties including two - point angular correlation function agree quite well with the observation .",
    "ly@xmath0 luminosities also match those of observed laes .",
    "the growth time from @xmath82 to @xmath81 can be translated into the lifetime of laes , which is assessed to be @xmath2  yr . a fluctuation with @xmath82 corresponds to an object that just collapses at the redshift .",
    "thus , laes are thought to be in the early evolutionary phase of galaxies , consistently with a recent theoretical prediction @xcite .",
    "we have also predicted the correlation function at redshift higher than 3 in the picture of short - lived laes . it is suggested that a certain fraction of young galaxies have already ended the lae phase even at redshift @xmath83 .",
