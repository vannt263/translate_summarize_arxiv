    "heat transport has attracted increasing interest recently in both classical nonlinear lattices and quantum systems@xcite . in this field ,",
    "a particularly interesting problem is related to the issue of fourier s law .",
    "considering for example the normal transport in one - dimensional systems , fourier s law states that @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the local heat current , @xmath2 is the local equilibrium temperature , and @xmath3 is the heat conductivity . if we let @xmath4 denote the local energy density , then the continuity equation reads @xmath5 . combining these equations with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the specific heat per unit volume , we arrive at the energy diffusion equation , @xmath8 .    in classical systems",
    ", it was shown that normal diffusion can be characterized by the mean squared displacement of the helfand moment @xcite , which is related to the autocorrelation function of heat current and thus to the green - kubo formula . beyond the normal diffusion",
    ", some recent works have investigated the relation between heat diffusion and conduction @xcite . in particular , a rigorous relationship between energy ( heat ) spread and heat conduction has been established from statistical principles@xcite .",
    "therein , an excess energy distribution is introduced , and then the energy diffusion is characterized by the mean square deviation ( msd ) of energy , which is connected to the autocorrelation function of heat current .",
    "accordingly , how thermal conductivity depends on the system size may be extracted from energy diffusion in lattice systems @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , heat transport in low - dimensional quantum systems has also been investigated intensively @xcite .",
    "a commonly used method is the green - kubo formula within linear response theory , where nonzero drude weights usually indicate ballistic transport .",
    "an interesting example is the ballistic energy transport in the spin-@xmath9 xxz chain due to the conservation of the current operator @xcite . besides , quantum quench dynamics or spreading of different densities ( e.g. , energy densities )",
    "has also been studied@xcite . to determine whether the spread process is ballistical , diffusive , or of other type",
    ", one can observe the time evolution of the spatial variance @xmath10 ( or msd ) of certain nonequilibrium density . for ballistic transport , the variance behaviors as @xmath11 whereas for diffusive transport @xmath12 . in ref",
    ", a connection between the variance and the current - autocorrelation function was proposed ; however , it is applicable at high temperatures .",
    "the general connection between the spreading processes and transport properties such as heat conductivity is not well understood yet .    in this paper ,",
    "starting from an energy density distribution , we give a general connection between the msd of energy diffusion and the autocorrelation function of energy current for quantum systems , within the linear response theory .",
    "this offers a different way to extract thermal conductivity from the energy spreading process . as an example",
    ", we apply it to a spinless fermion model , and the numerical results confirm this connection .",
    "in the following , we restrict to the one - dimensional case .",
    "the generalization to higher - dimensional systems is straightforward .",
    "the system is typically described by a continuous hamiltonian : @xmath13 at the infinite past an additional perturbation , @xmath14 , is also applied to the system . here",
    "@xmath15 is nonzero only in a local region .",
    "thus the total hamiltonian reads @xmath16 . before @xmath17",
    ", we suppose the system is described by a canonical ensemble at temperature @xmath18 .",
    "then the partition function is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . at time @xmath17 , the perturbation is turned off suddenly .",
    "after that the quenched initial nonequilibrium state begins to relax towards the equilibrium state , and so does the local energy distribution .",
    "the local excess energy at @xmath21 can be described by @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 denotes the expectation value in the nonequilibrium state , i.e. , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 denotes the equilibrium average , @xmath27 with @xmath28 .    to evaluate @xmath29",
    ", we consider an operator @xmath30 .",
    "the equation of motion of @xmath31 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 . to the first order of @xmath34",
    ", the solution can be written as @xmath35 .",
    "thus we may have @xmath36 then we can obtain the partition function to the first order of @xmath34 , @xmath37 substituting eqs .",
    "( [ eq_betah ] ) and ( [ eq_z ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq_deltah ] ) , we can obtain after some algebra , @xmath38 the second term in eq .",
    "( [ delta_h ] ) is time - independent actually .",
    "the probability distribution function is then defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a normalization constant ; see appendix [ appendixa ] .",
    "the mean square deviation for energy spread is then @xmath41 using the reasoning similar to ref .",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath42 is a constant .",
    "for later convenience , we introduce two correlation functions : @xmath43 and @xmath44 where the current operator @xmath1 is defined via the continuity equation , @xmath45 . for homogeneous systems ,",
    "these correlation functions are invariant under both temporal translation and spacial translation , i.e. , @xmath46 ; a similar relation holds for @xmath47 .",
    "further , we can have @xmath48@xcite .    making use of the above equations ,",
    "we can obtain @xmath49 that means @xmath50 eq .",
    "( [ connect ] ) is a rigorous result .",
    "integrating by parts twice and neglecting the boundary terms , we obtain the final result : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the current - current correlation function that appears in the green - kubo formula for heat conductivity ; see appendix [ appendixb ] . here",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 is the length of the system .",
    "it should be pointed out that taking the limit @xmath55 is necessary , because in systems with a finite size the autocorrelation function @xmath56 at low temperatures may not decay to zero as @xmath57 approaches to boundaries ( see the example below ) . in that case , the boundary terms such as @xmath58 need to be taken into account explicitly .",
    "it is straightforward to extend eq .",
    "( [ central_eq ] ) to other conserved quantities of the form @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is defined through the distribution @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the fluctuation of quantity @xmath64 .",

    "as a function of time .",
    "( b ) comparison of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the parameters are @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and we choose @xmath78 .",
    "the system size is @xmath79 . ]    as an application of eq .",
    "( [ central_eq ] ) , we consider a noninteracting fermion model , which may also be viewed as a spin-@xmath9 xy chain .",
    "for complicated systems , one may resort to methods such as finite - temperature , real - time density matrix renormalization group @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian we consider reads @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the local energy operator .",
    "the total size of the system is @xmath54 , and we adopt periodic boundary conditions . via the continuity equation , the current operator can be shown to be @xmath82 . the total energy current operator @xmath83 commutes with @xmath84 , and thus is conserved .",
    "note that usually energy current is different from heat current @xcite .",
    "however in the following we set the chemical potential to zero , so these two currents are the same in our case .",
    "we assume a local perturbation , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 otherwise . to compute the msd of energy diffusion ,",
    "we first evaluate eq .",
    "( [ delta_h ] ) . in the basis of single - particle eigenstates of @xmath84 ( @xmath89 )",

    "substituting eqs .",

    "( [ delta_h ] ) , we can get after some algebra @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the fermi - dirac distribution with the chemical potential being zero and we have used the identity @xmath97 = \\delta_{\\alpha \\gamma}\\delta_{\\beta \\delta}f_{\\beta}(1-f_{\\alpha})+\\delta_{\\alpha \\beta}\\delta_{\\gamma \\delta}f_{\\beta}f_{\\gamma}$ ] . the specific heat can be easily evaluated from @xmath98 , where @xmath99 . in a similar way we can evaluate @xmath100 , and",
    "the final result is @xmath101     as a function of the system size .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) @xmath102 in logarithm scale at time @xmath103 . in",
    "( b ) the total size is @xmath79 whereas in ( c ) @xmath104 .",

    "the corresponding real temperature is of order @xmath107 k , and a finite size @xmath79 is used here .",
    "we see that @xmath108 linearly increases with time .",
    "this is also reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , where @xmath109 is clearly a constant .",
    "thus the transport process is ballistic . to check the validity of eq .",
    "( [ central_eq ] ) , we plot @xmath109 and @xmath75 as functions of time in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , and a good agreement can be observed .    at low temperatures ,",
    "the finite size effect becomes prominent ; i.e. , there could be a big difference between @xmath109 and @xmath75 when the system size is not large enough . to characterize this difference",
    ", we plot the relative error @xmath110 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) . as the size increases",
    ", the error @xmath111 decays to zero rapidly .",
    "the reason for the big difference at a small size is that the current autocorrelation function @xmath112 does not decay to zero at the boundaries . for @xmath79 , @xmath113 takes an appreciably small value at the boundaries , while @xmath113 becomes very small at the boundaries for @xmath104 ; see figs .",
    "[ fig2](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "thus when integrating eq .",
    "( [ connect ] ) to get eq .",
    "( [ central_eq ] ) , we can not neglect the boundary terms for small systems .",
    "when the boundary terms are taken into account , we have found excellent agreement between @xmath74 and @xmath75 plus boundary terms regardless of the system size .",
    "in summary , within the linear response theory we have established a connection between the msd of energy diffusion and the autocorrelation function of energy current for quantum systems , i.e. , @xmath114 .",
    "it is straightforward to extend it to other conserved quantities . as an example , we have applied it to a spinless fermion model ( or the spin-@xmath115 xy model ) .",
    "we found that at high temperatures @xmath109 is consistent with @xmath75 even for a comparatively small size @xmath79 .",
    "however , at low temperatures , there may be large difference between @xmath109 and @xmath75 when the system size is small due to the ignorance of boundary terms .",
    "indeed when the boundary terms are included , we could still find excellent agreement between @xmath74 and @xmath75 plus boundary terms regardless of the system size .",
    "this connection thus offers an alternative way to extract conductivity from the energy spreading process in quantum systems .",
    "the work was supported by nsfc ( grant no .",
    "11204180 ) .",
    "here we will show @xmath116 . from eq .",
    "( [ delta_h ] ) , we see that @xmath117 consists of two terms .",
    "the first term is @xmath118 where we have used the spacial - translation invariance of @xmath119 .",

    "where @xmath123 , we can obtain @xmath124 .",
