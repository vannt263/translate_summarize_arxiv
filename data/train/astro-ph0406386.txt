    "the maximum integration time amounted to 4620sec per detector pixel of mips 24@xmath0mintegration and 6900sec of irac observations corresponding to background limited 5@xmath17 sensitivities of 6@xmath0jy / pix and 0.4@xmath0jy / pix ( 3.6 & 4.5@xmath0 m ) respectively ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the output of the spitzer science center v9.5 pipeline was post - processed after making corrections for varying sky background , striping ( jailbar ) correction for every fourth column due to a bias drift in the readout electronics , and distortion corrections based on a grid of 2mass stars and cross - channel counterparts in the irac and mips images .",
    "the images were then resampled ( drizzled ; fruchter & hook 2002 ) onto a 1.2@xmath18 pixel grid for mips and 0.6@xmath18 for irac and sources extracted .",
    "the observations covered a total area of @xmath11165@xmath19 with an integration time greater than 900s .",

    ".    for the irac data , roughly half the field was covered by the 3.6@xmath0 m  and 5.8@xmath0 m  channels , while the other half was covered by the 4.5 and 8.0@xmath0 m channels .",
    "only the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath0 m irac images are considered here , which together provide the best angular resolution and faintest flux limits currently available for studying the counterparts to the 24@xmath0 m sources .",
    "the source density in the irac channels was found to be about a factor of 4 higher than in the 24@xmath0 m  image at these depths .",
    "sources catalogs were generated using sextractor @xcite .",
    "sextractor parameters were fine tuned from simulated pure - noise images .",
    "these images were simulated by generating noise - only data frames where the rms for each 30s frame was the same as measured in the data . each frame",
    "was then run through the post - processing pipeline , applying the same distortion corrections and drizzle parameters in generating a final stack as for the real data . in general",
    ", we find that the majority of the sources in the real data are indistinguishable from a point source and so hereafter , we assume that all sources are point sources .",
    "the psf was measured from the real data and normalized by comparing the flux in an 18@xmath18 radius aperture of the psf with an equivalent sirtf / tinytim ( krist , personal communication ) generated psf with the same fwhm .",
    "point sources were then added on to the pure noise image with three different model flux distributions corresponding to the krr , ce and ldp models .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the difference in source density between the data and the models . allowing for a matching radius of 2.9@xmath18",
    ", we find that our sextractor parameters result in @xmath201% of spurious sources in our simulated images where we know the input catalog of sources .",
    "the flux of the extracted source was measured in a circular aperture of radius 6@xmath18 and corrected upwards by a factor 1.8 to account for the wings of the psf performed .",
    "we found that as a result of the large source density and the 4.7@xmath18 fwhm psf , using larger beams results in substantial contamination of the source flux from neighboring sources .",
    "completeness corrections and flux calibration were measured using a thorough monte - carlo approach . in each iteration of the process",
    ", 14 artificial sources were added to the original data image , and sextractor run on the resultant new image , with detection and flux measurement parameters identical to hose used for the original catalogs .",
    "the number of sources added was deliberately kept small to minimize source crowding in the images .",
    "sources present in the original image were tagged in the new image depending on the change in their position and/or change in their flux density .",
    "thus , if a source in the new image had a position within 2.9@xmath18 in the artificial image and had a flux difference of less than 5% it was tagged as unaffected by the artificial sources .",
    "an artifical source was regarded as detected if one of the untagged sources matched the input position of the artificial source to within 2.9@xmath18 .",
    "detection and flux measurement parameters were identical to those described above .",
    "the process was repeated a 1000 times with the 14 sources randomly generated from a flat flux distribution between 20@xmath0jy and 2000@xmath0jy .",
    "a matrix p@xmath21 for the output flux distribution of the artificial sources was generated where @xmath22 is the input flux and @xmath23 the output flux ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the nature of the p@xmath21 matrix is such that for a particular @xmath22 , the sum over all @xmath23 is less than unity .",
    "this is the completeness correction factor which was measured to be 50% at an input flux value of 35@xmath0jy .",
    "the observed catalog of sources in the real image was then distributed among the flux bins .",
    "the p@xmath21 matrix was renormalized such that the sum over @xmath22 for a particular @xmath23 was equal to the number of detected output sources in that flux bin .",
    "the completeness corrected counts in each flux bin @xmath22 is then the sum over @xmath23 of the renormalized p@xmath21 matrix .",
    "this approach was tested on the three simulated images , each with their own p@xmath21 matrix , and the input and output catalog compared to ensure the accuracy of the approach .",
    "uncertainties in the observed counts were assumed to be poissonian i.e. @xmath24 where n@xmath25 is the number of observed counts in the f@xmath25 flux bin .",
    "these were then propagated through the p@xmath21 matrix to derive the uncertainty in the completeness corrected counts .",
    "attempts to quantify the systematics in the counts were undertaken .",
    "these were dominated by the adopted size of the beam used to measure the flux and the resultant correction .",
    "a 5% flux calibration error was also introduced to assess the effect on the counts .",
    "the resultant systematic uncertainties are marked as the hatched region on the top panel of figure 3 .    to assess the accuracy of the source extraction at the faintest flux bins , where the completeness fraction is @xmath1130% ,",
    "a pure noise image was generated on a 1.2@xmath18 pixel grid and point sources added with a flux distribution that is identical to the completeness corrected counts at s@xmath26jy but with an extrapolation to flux densities of 1@xmath0jy using the ce model .",
    "artificial sources were added and extracted from this simulated image using the technique described earlier .",
    "the completeness corrected counts in this simulated image are only marginally different from those derived from the real data and hence we conclude that despite the large completeness corrections , the shape of the counts at the faint end are reliably determined .",
    "table 1 and figure 3 shows the completeness corrected 24 @xmath0 m  counts in elais - n1 and the actual number of detected sources in each flux bin .",
    "also shown in figure 3 are the model 24@xmath0 m  counts from xu , ce , ldp and krr .",
    "all the model counts are too high at bright flux densities ( s@xmath27jy ) with the ce model being the most deviant .",
    "this could be attributed to cosmic variance and poor statistics on bright objects in this field . however , based on the _ spitzer _",
    "24@xmath0 m  counts presented by @xcite in this issue which offer much better statistics at these brighter flux densities , it appears that this is a real feature .",
    "this is most likely because the evolutionary models of the various groups were fit to the published isocam 15@xmath0 m  counts from various different fields at flux densities of @xmath111 mjy which had large associated uncertainties and have since been shown to be too high ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at flux densities fainter than 400 @xmath0jy ,",
    "our counts indicate that both the ldp model and krr model are inconsistent with the observed counts .",
    "the ldp model is about 30% too low and has a faint end slope of s@xmath28 while the krr model is comparably low and has a faint end slope of s@xmath29 . for comparison",
    ", the observed counts in this field at flux densities in the range 20@xmath10200@xmath0jy can be fit by a polynomial of the form dn / ds ( arcmin@xmath30  @xmath0jy@xmath31)= 92@xmath32(s  @xmath0jy)@xmath33 .",
    "the xu and ce models are within the uncertainties in the counts in this flux range and have s@xmath34 slopes as well .",
    "to quantify the quality of the model source counts fits to the data at the faint end , we performed a minimum sum of absolute errors , a minimum chi - square as well as a maximum likelihood analysis of the observed completeness corrected counts since the uncertainty is dominated by poissonian errors .",
    "the likelihood , l is calculated as : @xmath35 the third term in the calculation of the likelihood , @xmath36 is irrelevant and is omitted in equation 1 .",
    "@xmath37 is the model counts in each of @xmath38 flux bins and @xmath39 is the observed counts corrected for completeness in those flux bins .",
    "we find that for both the minimum absolute errors and chi - square technique , the ce model which includes both density and luminosity evolution provides the best fit to the counts at flux values fainter 500 @xmath0jy .",
    "however , the maximum likelihood technique indicates that the xu model is marginally a better fit .",
    "thus , we conclude that the ce and xu models both provide reasonably good fits to the observed data at the faint end .",
    "although neither of these models provide good fits at s@xmath27jy , the counts at these flux limits are dominated by galaxies at _ z_@xmath200.5 .",
    "roughly speaking , the implication of this poor fit is that at these redshifts , the lig component is evolving much more rapidly than the ulig component .",
    "however , the paucity of sources at faint 24@xmath0 m fluxes implies that the rapid increase in the number density of infrared luminous galaxies between redshifts of 0 and 1@xmath101.5 that is required by the models does not extend to higher redshifts and the evolution either reaches a plateau or declines . since the optical / ultraviolet luminosity density ( with no dust corrections ) also rises but at a slower rate between _ z_@xmath110 and _ z_@xmath111 ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , the implication is that extinction - corrections to uv - derived star - formation rate measurements are increasing with redshift , particularly between 0@xmath40 .",
    "the predicted redshift distribution of the sources ( figure 4 ) in this flux range as derived from the models shows a bi - modal structure , peaking at redshift 1 and redshift 2 with @xmath1120% of sources being at redshifts between 2@xmath6z@xmath63 .",
    "the bi - modal nature of the redshift distribution is a result of the two strongest set of pah features , those around 8@xmath0 m and 12@xmath0 m , being redshifted into the 24@xmath0 m passband .",
    "luminous infrared galaxies account for about 60% of all sources while uligs are about 10% .",
    "the remainder consists of m82-analogs , i.e. low - redshift objects with l(8 - 1000@xmath0m)@xmath41  l@xmath3 .",
    "the robustness of this redshift distribution can be questioned since it depends on empirical evolutionary models which broadly fit other multi - wavelength counts but provide poor fits at bright 24@xmath0 m flux densities .",
    "ce emphasized the degeneracy in evolutionary parameters for the infrared luminosity function i.e. a number of models which provide reasonable fits to the observed counts can yield varying counts / star - formation rate estimates .",
    "however , the key conclusion was that all models required a flattening in their ( 1+z)@xmath42 evolution at z@xmath111",
    ". this is confirmed by the _ spitzer",
    "_  observations .",
    "we have re - derived the evolutionary parameters to fit the 24@xmath0 m counts in this paper and @xcite as well as the far - infrared counts in @xcite .",
    "we find that the key variable is the ratio of ligs to uligs which we now evolve independently unlike in ce . using the new evolutionary parameters which we will discuss in a later paper , we find that although the fractional contribution of ligs and uligs can differ slightly from that presented in figure 4 , the shape of the overall redshift distribution remains the same .",
    "the ce models derive the total 24@xmath0 m  ebl to be 3.7nw  m@xmath30  sr@xmath31of which 32% comes from sources brighter than 1000@xmath0jy .",
    "since the ce model is a factor of @xmath114 too high at the bright flux densities , the 24@xmath0 m ebl must be significantly lower than this estimate .",
    "the 24@xmath0 m  igl from the detected sources in the flux density range 20@xmath6s@xmath7  @xmath0jy in these _ spitzer _",
    "observations is 1.8@xmath430.2  nw  m@xmath30  sr@xmath31  while the completeness corrected counts yield a value of 2.0@xmath430.2  nw  m@xmath30  sr@xmath31 .",
    "thus , we conclude that these deep _ spitzer _  observations have resolved out at least 50% of the 24@xmath0 m  ebl and probably as much as 65% .",
    "isocam 15@xmath0 m  sources appear to be disparate from the scuba 850@xmath0 m  sources in that they have relatively bright optical / near - infrared counterparts which span the range of hubble - types in morphology .",
    "this seems to suggest that they are typically massive galaxies with stellar mass @xmath45  m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the scuba 850@xmath0 m  sources are optically faint and mostly irregular systems @xcite .",
    "this could be a result of morphological @xmath46correction since visible light observations of scuba sources trace rest - frame ultraviolet emission which could be patchy due to dust extinction internal to the galaxy .",
    "since the models suggest that the 24@xmath0 m  sources presented here are at redshifts intermediate to the isocam and 850@xmath0 m  sources , this would imply that they have rest - frame properties that are intermediate to those sources .",
    "we matched sources between mips and irac using a nearest neighbor match between the 24@xmath0 m  catalog and the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m  catalogs ( figure 5 ) . at a 24@xmath0 m  flux limit of 50@xmath0jy ,",
    "more than 85% of the sources have irac counterparts within 3@xmath18 , as compared to the 25% expected for random matches to objects with the same density ; thus at least 60% of the matches are physical .",
    "direct inspection of the remaining 15% shows that in almost all cases , separations of 3@xmath18 or larger arise not from a lack of physical counterpart , but due to a variety of other factors : 7.8% of mips sources fall in a region of low exposure time in either the irac image or mips image or both ; 3.6% are cases where the irac counterpart was not automatically detected because it falls near a much brighter irac sources and was not deblended from the brighter irac sources ; 6.5% of mips sources appear to be blended emission from two or more nearby irac sources in which case the mips source appears slightly extended / distorted and its centroid falls between the irac positions which are more than 3@xmath18 away .",
    "there are however 0.9% of cases where the mips source genuinely appears to have no irac counterpart to the sensitivity of the irac image .",
    "since the distribution of mips / irac flux ratios is broad , depending on the nature of the source and its redshift , faint mips sources could have counterparts which are below the flux threshold of the irac observations .",
    "therefore we conclude that the fraction of 24@xmath0 m  sources with reliable near - infrared associations is @xmath11100% .",
    "having identified the counterparts of the sources , we then proceed to estimate a flux ratio between the mid - infrared and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "for the mips catalog we adopted a beam size corrected flux value as described in section 2 . for the near - infrared we adopted sextractor flux values in a 6@xmath18 diameter beam and applied a 20% beamsize correction based on estimates published by the",
    "_ spitzer _  science center .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the mid - infrared to near - infrared flux ratios of the spitzer 24@xmath0 m  sources detected here .",
    "also shown as solid circles is the 15@xmath0 m  to hk - band flux ratio ( partly from * ? ? ?",
    "* and partly from the goods data ) for the isocam 15@xmath0 m  sources in the hdf - n which have spectroscopically determined redshifts peaking at @xmath110.8 . due to the shape of the dust spectral energy distribution at these wavelengths , sources at the same redshift will mostly be brighter at observed 24@xmath0 m  than at observed 15@xmath0 m .",
    "however , at @xmath47 , the properties of 24@xmath0 m  sources should trace the same rest - frame emission as the 15@xmath0 m  observations at z@xmath111 . since , the mid - infrared flux of a galaxy traces its total star - formation rate , while the near - infrared flux is a measure of the stellar mass in the galaxies , the similarity in this flux ratio between the isocam and mips sources broadly suggests that the specific star - formation rate i.e. the ratio of sfr to stellar mass , is very similar among the _",
