    "the existence of dark matter and its nature play a key role in understanding structure formation after the big bang and the energy density of the universe @xcite .",
    "dark matter can not be explained with known types of matter ; therefore , we are at the dawn of something significantly new .",
    "the importance of this problem becomes obvious by recalling that dark matter is approximately five times more abundant than regular matter .",
    "little is known about the nature of dark matter particles , but that they are relatively heavy , interacting gravitationally with regular matter , but otherwise , interacting only weakly if at all . if dark matter was in thermal equilibrium with the rest of the matter in the early universe and froze out when the temperature dropped due to expansion , it is a natural assumption in many models that dark matter particles are able to annihilate with each other and produce known standard model particles in this way",
    ". these particles would contribute to the known cosmic ray fluxes and , as the kinematic characteristics of these processes are different from the production mechanisms of the conventional cosmic rays , it could be possible to observe the imprint of dark matter in the diffuse cosmic ray spectra in the form of an excess .",
    "well - motivated theories beyond the standard model of particle physics contain candidates with exactly these properties .",
    "cosmic ray antiparticles  without primary sources  are ideal candidates for such a search .",
    "however recent results show that accomplishing this task with positrons and antiprotons appears to be difficult @xcite .",
    "antideuterons would also be generated in dark matter annihilations and are a potential breakthrough approach .",
    "secondary antideuterons , like antiprotons , are produced when cosmic ray protons or antiprotons interact with the interstellar medium , but the production threshold for this reaction is higher for antideuterons than antiprotons .",
    "collision kinematics also disfavor the formation of low - energy antideuterons in these interactions .",
    "moreover the steep energy spectrum of cosmic rays means there are fewer particles with sufficient energy to produce secondary antideuterons , and those that are produced will have relatively large kinetic energy . as a consequence ,",
    "a low - energy search for primary antideuterons has very low background @xcite .",
    "this feature of antideuteron searches , along with the growing realization that such searches probe supersymmetric models in a broad way , has attracted considerable attention .",
    "many theoretical papers discuss aspects of antideuteron dark matter searches @xcite . in this",
    "regard , supersymmetric and universal extra dimension theories provide the most popular and theoretically well - motivated dark matter candidates @xcite .",
    "the absolute flux expected for antideuterons is very low , and therefore any attempt to measure it needs an exceptionally strong particle identification .",
    "predicted antideuteron fluxes from different dark matter models updated by more recent coalescence momentum value ( purple , red , green lines ) @xcite and secondary / tertiary background flux from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium ( blue line ) @xcite .",
    "antideuteron limits from bess @xcite and sensitivities for the running ams @xcite and the planned gaps experiments @xcite are also shown . ]    in the near future the challenging search for antideuterons will exclusively rely on the general antiparticle spectrometer ( section  [ s - gaps ] ) and on the alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ams ) , a multi - purpose cosmic ray detector on the international space station @xcite . figure  [ f - fig1_jap_pgaps ] shows the theoretically expected antideuteron fluxes from different dark matter models in comparison to the secondary background .",
    "the different boxes demonstrate the antideuteron flux limits of bess @xcite and the sensitivity reaches of gaps and ams @xcite , which reach for the first time the sensitivity to probe predictions of well - motivated models .",
    "both experiments have mostly complementary kinetic energy ranges but also some overlap in the interesting low - energy region .",
    "in addition , another very important virtue comes from the different detection techniques .",
    "ams identifies particles by analyzing the event signatures of different subsequent subdetectors and a strong magnetic field and gaps by slowing down the antideuteron and creating an exotic atom inside the target material and analyzing the decay .",
    "this allows the study of both a large energy range and independent experimental confirmation , which is crucial for a rare event search like the hunt for cosmic ray antideuterons .",
    "gaps detector concept with antiproton and antideuteron signatures . ]",
    "the general antiparticle spectrometer is designed to measure low - energy cosmic antideuterons . as mentioned above",
    ", the expected antideuteron flux is very low and therefore a large acceptance and long flight time are indispensable .",
    "figure  [ f - fig1_jap_pgaps ] demonstrates that the dark matter signal above the background is expected to be the largest at low kinetic energies of 100500mev .",
    "it is therefore planned for gaps to carry out a series of long duration balloon flights from antarctica , where the deflection of low - energy charged cosmic rays in the geomagnetic field is the smallest .",
    "another important effect for the low - energy cosmic ray detection comes from the interaction of the solar wind with cosmic rays , which effectively decreases the observable interstellar flux .",
    "the strength of the solar modulation depends on the 11 year long solar cycle , which will approximately reach the next minimum in 2019 @xcite",
    ". the first science gaps flight will be possible from 2017 and will therefore only feel a small solar influence",
    ".      the core of the detector will be a track reconstruction device consisting of 10 layers of lithium - drifted silicon ( si(li ) ) modules ( figure  [ f - fig2_jap_pgaps ] ) that will be enclosed by a hermetically sealed time - of - flight system ( tof ) made of plastic scintillators with photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) readout .",
    "this box will be surrounded by another half - cube of plastic scintillators .",
    "the inner tracker core ( trk ) will be a cube of 2 m edge length and the outer tof half - cube will have a width of 4 m .",
    "these detector components will be used for a novel detection approach to clearly identify low - energy antideuterons .",
    "the idea is to stop low - energy antideuterons in the tracker material , to replace a shell electron of the target material with this antideuteron , and to form an excited exotic atom .",
    "the hydrogen - like atom will deexcite by autoionization followed by characteristic x - ray ladder transitions . at the end of the ladder transitions the antideuteron will annihilate in a hadronic interaction with the nucleus and",
    "produce pions and protons",
    ". the detector will be able to measure the velocity and the charge of the incoming particle in the tof as well as the stopping depth of a particle in the tracker and the development of the energy loss per layer throughout the slowing process .",
    "moreover , the tracker will resolve the characteristic x - ray energies and track the pions and protons .",
    "the main source of background for the antideuteron signal comes from antiprotons .",
    "therefore , good depth sensing and x - ray energy resolution along with a reliable tracking and counting of pions / protons are essential for a high background rejection .",

    "the small acceptance and short flight time compared to the full - scale experiment did not allow a study of antiprotons or antideuterons .",
    "however , the prototype consisted of all major components that will be part of the full gaps experiment ( figure  [ f - fig3_jap_pgaps ] ) .",
    "the carbon fiber structure of the balloon gondola frame had a height of 1.2 m , the mass of the science part of the gondola was 308 kg , and the total power consumption was 430w .",
    "a full description of the instrument can be found here @xcite .      in total six circular modules",
    "were arranged in two stacks of three with a vertical spacing of 20 cm and mounted into a watertight plastic vessel .",
    "the individual circular si(li ) modules were manufactured by semikon detektor gmbh of jlich , germany . for the full payload",
    "the detectors will be manufactured by the gaps collaboration @xcite .",
    "five modules had a thickness of 2.5 mm and one of 4.0 mm .",
    "the active area of each module had a diameter of 9.4 cm and was divided into eight strips .",
    "the strips on the p+ side were contacted by implanted boron and on the n+ side by lithium contacts . for full depletion",
    "the detectors had to be cooled down to at least -25  and were operated with reverse bias voltages of 185 - 240v .",
    "the cooling system used a closed - loop coolant pipe with fluorinert fluid to transport the heat from the detectors to a radiator using a pump .",
    "an attitude control system was designed to point the radiator to the anti - sun side during the flight . on the ground ,",
    "the radiator was thermally coupled to a heat exchanger cooled by liquid nitrogen and the detectors were operated in a dry nitrogen atmosphere .    for the science payload it will be important to resolve x - rays in the range of 10100kev while simultaneously measuring charged energy depositions up to 50mev .",
    "therefore , the pgaps si(li ) electronics had a dual readout scheme , with separate high and low gain processing chains for each detector strip , which consisted of two card cages with three analog readout boards each .",
    "the card cages , boards , and digital signal processing units had been flown on the nuclear compton telescope prototype in 2005 @xcite and were modified to meet the requirements for pgaps .",
    "the electronics were designed to work at low pressures and temperatures and were housed in a watertight plastic vessel .",
    "the electronics also recorded various scalers important for monitoring the quality of the signal processing of the different detector strips , temperatures , electronic status , and livetime .    for in - flight calibration the payload was equipped with a silver target x - ray tube and provided , together with a gold filter , a characteristic spectrum with peaks at 26 and 36kev .",
    "the tube was mounted under the bottom time - of - flight layer and the position was optimized to illuminate the detectors as uniformly as possible .",
    "in addition , the 59.5kev line of an americium-241 ( am-241 ) radioactive source was used for ground calibration during the qualification , integration , and flight preparation stages .",
    "the time - of - flight system ( tof ) consisted of three layers of crossed plastic scintillator paddles , two above and one below the tracker .",

    "the paddles were made of bicron bc-408 material and were 50 cm long , 15 cm wide , and 3 mm thick .",
    "each paddle end was attached to a curved , acrylic light guide coupled to a hamamatsu r-7600 photomultiplier tube , which was operated at about 800 - 900v .",
    "prior to the flight , all flight ( and flight spare ) tof pmt assemblies were operated at full hv for a minimum of 5hours each in a low pressure environment .",
    "the test was not a full thermal - vacuum test since the temperature was not controlled .",
    "however , the pressure was varied over a range of pressures expected in flight ( 150torr ) , with most of the test taking place at pressures between 5 and 10torr . no failures or degraded performance",
    "were observed for any pmts in the tests .",
    "the spacing between the top and bottom layer was 0.94 m and the spacing between the top and middle layer was 0.38 m .",
    "the tof data were processed in a vme rack with modules .",
    "the vme system also made the tof trigger decision that will be further explained in the next section .",
    "in addition to the trigger decision , the electronics digitized the scintillator light output as measured by the pmts and generated time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) values with 50ps resolution based on a discriminator threshold .",
    "housekeeping data were also recorded .",
    "the tof electronics , flight computer , attitude control system electronics , and a fiber optic gyroscope were mounted together in a pressurized vessel since the tof electronics modules were not designed to operate in vacuum .",
    "pgaps was operated in several different data taking modes .",
    "the goal was both to collect tracks of charged particles traversing the tof and the tracker and to measure the stability of the x - ray performance of the tracker modules . therefore two different trigger schemes were deployed .",
    "the tof trigger mode was based on the coincident signals of two crossed paddles of the tof middle layer and at least one additional signal in the top or bottom tof layer , which triggered the simultaneous readout of all pmts and also of all tracker modules . in this way",
    "particle tracks with coincident signals in different detector layers could be recorded .    during the tracker trigger mode each si(li )",
    "module was able to self - trigger its own readout based on discriminator thresholds .",
    "eventually it will be crucial for gaps to detect x - rays in coincidence with charged particle tracks , but for calibration purposes no coincidence with other tracker modules or the tof was required . during flight ,",

    "the 6:10h of science data taking were split into cadences of tof trigger mode ( @xmath2min ) , x - ray tube calibration ( @xmath3min ) , tracker trigger mode ( @xmath4min ) , and at the very end tof trigger mode with tracker turned off for 13min .",

    "the error bars reflect the error on the mean trigger rate for each altitude bin .",
    "the error bar length is affected by the number of available samples for each altitude bin , which is defined by the altitude change velocity , and the spread of trigger rate samples at the specific altitude .",

    "in addition , the geometrical acceptance for tof trigger events with at least two tracker hits in active channels is shown ( red ) . ]    as mentioned above , a critical parameter for the operation of si(li ) detectors is the temperature .",
    "ground testing showed that most detector channels started to deplete from about -15  to -20 .",
    "the coldest temperature at launch inside the tracker vessel measured on one of the detectors of the bottom layer was about -40  and the average temperature was -34 .",

    "the radiator was directly exposed to the ambient medium . during ascent",
    "it was not planned to have attitude control as the atmosphere is too dense and therefore the gondola was spinning randomly . upgoing spikes in the temperature distribution of the radiator",

    "was supposed to point the radiator towards the anti - sun side of the gondola to act as a heat dump for the tracker modules .",
    "unfortunately , due to an operational mistake this control was not possible .",
    "as a result the gondola was spinning at an approximately constant rate of one rotation every 5min , as measured by the fiber optical gyroscope , causing the tracker vessel to warm up by 0.02/min .",
    "one of the main goals of the pgaps flight was to verify the thermal model for the cooling approach of the si(li ) detectors .",
    "although the rotator failed , this goal was fully accomplished and the thermal analysis of all recorded temperature sensors led to a complete understanding of the thermal system @xcite . for flights of the full gaps instrument from antarctica the well established rotator from the columbia scientific balloon facility would be used .",
    "however , the effect of the increasing tracker temperature needs to be accounted for in the science flight data analysis .",
    "figure  [ f - fig10_jap_pgaps ] shows the time evolution of the total number of active channels for the individual detectors over the course of the flight . under nominal operating conditions , out of 48 total channels 44 channels were operating",
    "while the other four channels were known not to be working since the qualification phase . at the time",
    "the tracker was turned off ( 10:30am ) the mean temperature was about -17  and 28 channels were still operational while the other 16 channels were either non - functional due to high leakage currents saturating the preamplifier or being no longer depleted .",
    "laboratory measurement after the flight at nominal temperatures showed that these channels were fully functional .",
    "the individual detectors and also the strips within a detector showed a variation with temperature , which is explainable by two different effects .",
    "some of the wire bonds between the si(li ) detector printed circuit boards to the detector surfaces were of visibly poor quality , which increased the noise level and therefore required lower operating temperatures compared to neighboring strips with better bonding quality .",
    "another effect was related to the surface condition of the grooves between the strips causing channels to deplete at different voltages due to inter - electrode capacitance differences .",
    "these effects were carefully investigated as for the full - scale payload the si(li ) modules will be fabricated in house by the gaps collaboration .",
    "for instance , one advantage of the gaps si(li ) modules over the semikon modules is the use of a robust pressure contact instead of wire bonding .",
    "another advantage is that the detectors will be structured on the n+ side instead of the p+ side . in this way ,",

    "compared to the measurement shown for a different detector in figure  [ f - fig7_jap_pgaps ] , a weaker am-241 line with respect to the x - ray tube lines is visible because less material is in front of the x - ray tube and more material in front of the am-241 source .",
    "the right side of figure  [ f - fig11_jap_pgaps ] depicts the evolution of the position and width of the gaussian fit for the dominant 26kev x - ray tube peak over time .",

    "the observed effect of energy resolution change with temperature is small .",
    "once a strip was cold enough ( -20 ) to be depleted and have a small enough leakage current the x - ray resolution improved only by about 10 - 15% until it reached the nominal operational temperature of -35 .",

    "the distributions are normalized to the path length in the material:=,where @xmath11 is the zenith angle of the track and @xmath12 the thickness of the individual si(li ) module .",
    "the black distribution shows the behavior for strips on the track with a clear peak at ( @xmath13)kev / mm , a steep decline towards smaller energy depositions , and a long tail , as expected from a landau distribution for charged particle energy depositions .",
    "the red distribution represents the energy depositions for adjacent strips to the strip position calculated from the track parameters .",
    "it is very similar in shape to the on - track distribution starting from the most probable value ( mop ) .",
    "the resolution of the track fit is about 1.3 si(li ) strips wide and therefore allows hits in the neighboring strip of the calculated position . a smaller fraction of this distribution can also be attributed to cross - talk between adjacent strips due to capacitive coupling ( section  [ s - trk_stab ] ) . below the mop more low energy entries are visible than for the on - track distribution . contributing effects are increased detector noise from the non - optimal tracker operating temperature ( section  [ s - trk_stab ] ) , coherent atmospheric shower particles and lower energy depositions from interaction products of the primary charged particle in the detector material moving at a different angle , or to a very small degree incoherent atmospheric and cosmic x - rays .",
    "the distribution shapes for strips further than one strip away from the calculated track is radically different and only show a low energy contribution , supporting the reliability of the track fit . in the following ,",
    "strips adjacent to the calculated track position with non - zero energy depositions are considered as on - track hits and farther away strips as off - track .    as the mop for a minimum ionizing charged particle energy distribution scales as the square of its charge @xmath14 and",

    ". this value should be interpreted as a lower bound as the si(li ) module operating temperature was not optimal .      as the gaps antideuteron search will rely on a good x - ray identification ,",

    "the three - dimensional error bars for a track point were chosen such that they span a volume of 68.3% the size of the paddle or strip volume around the track point . the case for the rectangular box",
    "shaped tof paddles is trivial and the error bars are set to be @xmath96{68.3\\,\\%}/2 $ ] times the length of the paddle in its @xmath97 direction .",
    "the error boxes used for the case of the si(li ) modules are shown in figure  [ f - fig35_jap_pgaps ] .",
    "the track fits were performed using the minuit fitting routines provided by root @xcite .",
    "a track is considered to be good if the requirement @xmath98 was fulfilled , where the @xmath93-value is defined as : p=_^2^f(t , n)twith the number of degrees of freedom @xmath99 and the @xmath80 probability density function @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath99 is the number of points used for the track fit subtracted by two . from purely statistical effects",
    "it is expected that the @xmath93-value distribution is uniform .",
    "a peak at @xmath101 corresponds to too many large @xmath80 values and is not in agreement with statistical fluctuations . for track quality reasons",
    "only the nearly uniform part above 5% of the distribution was taken into account ( figure  [ f - fig36_jap_pgaps ] ) .",
    "clean tracks used for the analysis were required to have more than two hits in any active detector volume and in addition to show at least two tracker hits with energy depositions @xmath94 .",
    "figure  [ f - fig36_jap_pgaps ] demonstrates the power of this requirement as the tighter tracker constraint ( red histogram ) makes the distribution much cleaner than the looser definition ( black histogram ) because the tof position resolution is much coarser than the tracker resolution .",
