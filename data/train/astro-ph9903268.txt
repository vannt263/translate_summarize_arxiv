    "there is good evidence that the three known soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are associated with supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "sgr0525 - 66 appears to be in n49 in the large magellanic cloud ( cline et al .",
    "1982 ) , and sgr1806 - 20 ( atteia et al . 1987 ) in g10.0 - 0.3 ( kulkarni & frail 1993 ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "1994 ; kulkarni et al . 1994 ; murakami et al .",
    "1994 ) . sgr1900 + 14 lies close to , although not within , g42.8 + 0.6 ( kouveliotou et al . 1994 ; hurley et al .",
    "the sgrs are believed to be magnetars , i.e. neutron stars with magnetic field strengths in excess of 10@xmath5 g. in these objects , magnetic energy dominates rotational energy .",
    "in this paper we present gamma - ray observations of a new source , sgr1627 - 41 , first detected in 1998 june , whose repetition , time histories , energy spectra , and location are all consistent with the properties of the known sgrs .",
    "we present observations by the 3rd interplanetary network ( ipn ) , consisting in this case of the gamma - ray burst experiment aboard the _ ulysses spacecraft , the konus experiment aboard the wind spacecraft , and the _ burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) aboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) , and use them to derive a precise source location for sgr1627 - 41 .",
    "the typical energy ranges for the experiments and the data considered here are 25 - 150 , 50 - 200 , and 25 - 100 kev , respectively . at the time of these observations , _ ulysses was located @xmath0 2900 light - seconds from earth while wind was @xmath0 3 light - seconds away ; cgro was in near - earth orbit .",
    "the first confirmed _ ulysses observation of the new sgr was on 1998 june 17 .",
    "the last was on 1998 july 12 . in all , 36 events were observed by _",
    "ulysses and an instrument on at least one near - earth spacecraft , either konus - wind or batse , and triangulation gave mutually consistent annuli .",
    "( numerous other events were observed by batse alone , and numerous candidate events were also observed by a single instrument , either konus or _",
    "ulysses grb , which could not be localized ; we do not consider them here . )",
    "each of the three instruments has various data - collecting modes which may be summarized as either `` triggered '' or `` untriggered '' .",
    "the time resolutions in triggered modes are as fine as 2 ms , while in untriggered modes , they may be as coarse as @xmath0 1 s. table 1 lists the bursts and the modes , and figure 1 shows a typical time history . when observed in triggered mode by _ ulysses , almost all of the events considered here had durations @xmath6 200 ms ; as observed by batse , several events had durations of up to @xmath0 2 s. _ _ _",
    "_    in principle , short events such as these present an ideal case for localization by triangulation , since the width of a triangulation annulus is proportional to the uncertainty in cross - correlating the time histories observed by a pair of spacecraft .",
    "however , two other factors must be considered .",
    "first , to obtain a small cross - correlation uncertainty , the event must be observed in triggered modes by _ ulysses and another spacecraft ; only 11 of the events in table 1 satisfy this criterion .",
    "( intense activity from a repeating source tends to fill trigger memories , so that subsequent events can only be recorded in an untriggered mode . )",
    "second , the proximity of the wind and cgro spacecraft results in triangulation annuli which intersect at grazing incidence for any given burst , resulting in a long , narrow error box . to reduce the length of the error box for this sgr , we have combined bursts from the first and last triggered mode observations , on june 17 and july 12 .",
    "the slowly moving _ ulysses - earth vector , which is approximately the center of the triangulation annulus , produces a shorter error box . _ _",
    "figure 2 shows a portion of the ipn error box , defined by the intersection of two @xmath0 16 @xmath2 wide annuli .",
    "the corners of this @xmath0 7.6 arcminute@xmath3 error box are given in table 2 .",
    "strictly speaking , the curvature of the annuli does not allow the resulting error box to be defined by straight - line segments ; for this reason , we also give the centers , radii , and widths of the annuli in table 3 .",
    "figure 2 also includes the 843 mhz radio contours of the galactic supernova remnant g337.0 - 0.1 , taken from the catalog of whiteoak and green ( 1996 ) .",
    "finally , figure 2 also shows the position of a bepposax quiescent x - ray source believed to be the sgr counterpart ( woods et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the intersection of the 3@xmath7 ipn annuli with the 95% confidence error circle defines a @xmath4 error box whose area is @xmath0 0.6 arcminutes@xmath3 ; the coordinates of this error box are given in table 4 .    these two error boxes are consistent with , but considerably smaller than , the following locations previously determined for this sgr : 1 ) the batse error circle derived from four triggers ( kouveliotou et al",
    ". 1998a ) .",
    "( based on this initial location , the source was named sgr 1627 - 41 ) .",
    "2 ) the initial ipn annulus ( hurley et al .",
    "1998a ) 3 ) the restriction of the initial ipn annulus to locations consistent with batse earth - limb occultation considerations ( woods et al . 1998 ) 4 ) a refined , but still preliminary ipn annulus ( hurley et al .",
    "1998b ) , 5 ) the initial _",
    "rossi x - ray timing explorer all sky monitor ( rxte - asm ) error box ( smith and levine 1998 ) , and 6 ) the final rxte - asm error box ( smith et al . 1999 ) _",
    "if we adopt as a working hypothesis that sgr1627 - 41 is a magnetar , and that magnetars have lifetimes @xmath0 10,000 years ( thompson and duncan 1995 ) , then we would expect the ipn position to be coincident with that of a radio supernova remnant , whose observable lifetimes are @xmath6 20,000 years ( braun , goss , and lyne 1989 ) .",
    "also , three sgrs are known to be quiescent soft x - ray point sources : sgr0525 - 66 ( rothschild , kulkarni , & lingenfelter 1994 ) , sgr1806 - 20 ( murakami et al . 1994 ) , and sgr1900 + 14 ( hurley et al . 1994 , 1999b ) . with this in mind , we can then inquire how compelling the ipn / g337.0 - 0.1/bepposax association is .",
    "we first calculate the probability that the 1.8@xmath1 by 16@xmath2 ipn annulus intersects a snr in the 843 mhz survey of the most catalog ( whiteoak and green 1996 ) ? a rigorously correct method to estimate this probability was presented by kulkarni and frail ( 1993 ) , but a very simple argument can be used to derive an absolute lower limit .",
    "the most survey covered galactic coordinates @xmath8 .",
    "73 snrs with measured sizes are cataloged , and they occupy @xmath0 0.022 of the total area surveyed . thus in the limit where the error box is a point ,",
    "the probability of a chance association would be @xmath0 0.022 .",
    "however , two factors will increase this substantially .",
    "first , given the fact that sgr1900 + 14 appears to be outside its supernova remnant ( hurley et al .",
    "1999a ) , we would probably accept an sgr / snr association where the error box lay outside the remnant , increasing the effective occupied area of the survey .",
    "second , the method of kulkarni and frail ( 1993 ) , which is more appropriate for the long , narrow ipn error box , would result in a higher probability .",
    "we next ask what the probability is that the ipn error box will coincide with a quiescent soft x - ray source .",
    "one unidentified source with a 1 @xmath9 error radius was detected in the bepposax observations ( woods et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the field of view was 28 @xmath9 in radius . applying the method of kulkarni and frail ( 1993 ) gives a chance probability of 0.17 .",
    "thus the joint probability of the ipn / g337.0 - 0.1/bepposax association is @xmath100.004 .",
    "fortunately , more data which can substantiate the ipn / x - ray source / snr association are forthcoming .",
    "an _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics observation of the x - ray source is planned for 1999 .",
    "this will allow us to confirm the suggested 6.47 s period , observed with a low statistical significance in the bepposax data ( woods et al . 1999 ) , and possibly derive the period derivative . a high spindown rate , as found for sgr1806 - 20 and sgr1900 + 14 ( kouveliotou et al . 1998b , 1999",
    ") would be a compelling argument that the source is indeed a magnetar associated with the snr . _",
    "if this indeed proves to be the case , the transverse velocity of the magnetar can be estimated .",
    "the distance to g337.0 - 0.1 has been estimated to be as small as 5.8 kpc by case and bhattacharya ( 1998 ) based on a a new @xmath11-d relation for supernova remnants , and as large as 11 kpc by sarma et al .",
    "( 1997 ) based on radio recombination lines .",
    "the displacement between the core of the remnant and the ipn / sax error box is @xmath01.3 @xmath9 . from this",
    ", we obtain velocities between @xmath0200 and 2000 km / s for the smaller distance , and for assumed ages of 10,000 and 1000 y , consistent with the transverse velocities of the other three sgrs .",
