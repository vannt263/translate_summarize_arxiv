    "low dimensional quantum systems attract much experimental and theoretical attention , due to the rich physics arising from their enhanced quantum fluctuations . most prominently , quantum effects are manifested by quasi - one dimensional ( 1d ) spin systems , namely , spin ladders @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies primarily focused on models of coupled spin-@xmath1 chains with anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) exchange interactions .",
    "in addition to being motivated by the existence of real materials , these were inspired by the seminal work of haldane @xcite , which pointed out the crucial distinction between odd and even spin @xmath8 .",
    "the same physics carries through to multi - leg spin-@xmath1 ladder systems @xcite , where the number of legs @xmath5 replaces the general spin @xmath9 in the haldane chain .",
    "a particularly striking signature of quantum fluctuations arises in the case of odd @xmath5 , characterized by a magnetically disordered ground - state with power - law spin - spin correlations .",
    "this behavior , which reflects the presence of gapless spin - flip excitations ( spinons ) , is the simplest realization of a so - called `` spin - liquid '' phase @xcite beyond 1d .",
    "notably , the above described quantum features are characteristic to afm spin ladders .",
    "ferromagnetic ( fm ) ladders , on the other hand , are more `` classical '' in nature and in the heisenberg ( @xmath10-symmetric ) case , long range fm order is established .",
    "nevertheless , quantum effects were observed in certain spin - ladder compounds @xcite , and were shown theoretically to yield a rich phase diagram @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient promoting quantum fluctuations in such systems is anisotropy in the exchange interactions of the xxz type . as a result ,",
    "the spin system becomes either an easy - plane or easy axis fm , and can undergo a quantum phase transition , e.g. in the presence of a transverse field .",
    "realistic magnetic materials quite often possess heisenberg exchange interactions , hence much of the earlier literature on quantum magnetism did not regard anisotropy as a significant parameter .",
    "however , the coupling of real spin to additional degrees of freedom may introduce appreciable ( and possibly tunable ) anisotropic interactions .",
    "in particular , in the recent years there has been growing interest in systems based on heavy elements with strong spin - orbit coupling , which pave the way to realizing a variety of unconventional spin models .",
    "a prominent example is the proposal @xcite to realize spin interaction terms in iridate crystals that are effectively consistent with the highly anisotropic kitaev model @xcite , and hence support a quantum spin - liquid ground state in a genuinely two - dimensional ( 2d ) system .",
    "an alternative route to the formation of anisotropic exchange interactions naturally arises in systems with iso - spin degrees of freedom , such as the layer or valley index in bi - layers or bipartite lattices .",
    "a fascinating playground for such realizations of quantum spin models is provided by quantum hall ferromagnetism ( qhfm)@xcite , established in 2d electron systems subject to a strong magnetic field .",
    "most notable is its manifestation in graphene : the multi - component nature of the spin / iso - spin manifold leads to a plethora of exchange - induced broken symmetry phases , where anisotropy plays a crucial role @xcite .",
    "yet another type of system effectively described by inherently anisotropic quantum spin models is the superconducting ( sc ) ladder @xcite , which implements a mapping of the complex sc order parameter field to a bosonic representation of local spin operators .",
    "a particularly appealing aspect of the latter two realizations is that the control of parameters , as well as the measurement of physical properties , are accessible by electric means .",
    "specifically in graphene qhfm , electric conduction distinguishes a fm order in the bulk from other broken - symmetry phases @xcite as it supports a gapless conducting mode .",
    "this mode is associated with quantum fluctuations of a domain wall ( dw ) configuration @xcite , which forms at the edge of the sample in the fm state and can be modeled as a luttinger liquid ( ll ) @xcite . due to the spin - charge coupling characteristic to quantum hall systems",
    ", this mode is relatively protected from backscattering and exhibits a nearly perfect electrical conductivity @xcite .",
    "similar conducting dw channels can also form in the bulk , e.g. in bilayer graphene where a non - uniform effective zeeman field is induced by a spatially dependent gate voltage @xcite .",
    "derivation of an effective low energy theory describing the dynamics of these modes ( and hence their transport properties ) requires the quantum analysis of a spin system subject to non - uniform fields @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the problem of a generic spin configuration in the quantum regime , where spin fluctuations can not be treated in the framework of spin wave approach @xcite . to this end",
    ", we analyze the low energy dynamics of a smooth dw of an arbitrary finite width and shape , in a fm with anisotropic exchange interactions .",
    "this generalizes an earlier study of a sharp dw configuration @xcite , which has been predicted to possess a phase transition to a spin - ordered configuration as a function of anisotropy strength . in the present work we model the dw as a multi - leg ladder of ferromagnetic @xmath2 spin-@xmath1 chains subject to a kink - like magnetic field @xmath4 , and",
    "derive a 1d low - energy effective theory which allows to explore the dependence of its quantum dynamics on field strength and shape .",
    "in particular , we identify the regime of parameters where a quantum phase transition from a ll to spin density wave ( sdw ) can occur .",
