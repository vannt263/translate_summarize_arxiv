    "further majorana phases have not been introduced , since oscillation experiments are only sensitive to the two neutrino mass squared differences @xmath6 and to the four parameters in the mixing matrix of eq .",
    "( [ pmns ] ) : three angles and the dirac cp - violating phase , @xmath7 .",

    "@xcite :    @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12    the next steps on the way of a full understanding of neutrino oscillations by using neutrino beams produced at accelerators are    * confirm the source of atmospheric neutrino oscillations , i. e. observe the oscillation @xmath13 ; * measure the remaining parameters of the pmns mixing matrix : @xmath2 and @xmath7 ; * measure the sign of @xmath14 ; * perform precision measurements of the angles @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and of @xmath17 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is worth noting that there are other searches ( like @xmath1-decay and double-@xmath1 decay experiments , and space experiments studying anisotropies in cosmic background radiation ) which provide very important information like the absolute value of the neutrino mass or whether the neutrino is a dirac or a majorana particle . for a comprehensive review of the analysis of these experiments we refer to  @xcite and references therein .    among the oscillation parameters , a relevant role is played by the mixing angle @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a vanishing or too small value for @xmath2 , would make impossible the observation of the cp violation in the leptonic sector and fix the neutrino mass hierarchy ( sign of @xmath14 exploiting matter effects ) . if @xmath2 is large enough ( @xmath18 ) to allow for its discovery by the forthcoming experiments  @xcite ( phase i experiments ) , new facilities and new experiments  @xcite ( phase ii experiments )",
    "would be needed in order to precisely measure the pmns matrix .",
    "several projects have been proposed for the phase ii ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate a possible window of opportunity for the neutrino oscillation physics compatible with the upgrade of the lhc ( after 2015 ) that fully exploits european infrastructures and that has an adequate sensitivity to the 1 - 3 sector of the pmns matrix .",
    "this paper is organized as follow .",
    "after a review of the proposed neutrino beams in europe  [ beams ] , we focus on the @xmath1-beam concept and in particular on a @xmath1-beam set - up based on the so - called super - sps .",
    "we then discuss the proposed detector to exploit the neutrino beam and finally present its physics reach .",
    "current neutrino oscillation experiments are based on beams where neutrinos come from the decay of mesons produced in the interaction of high energy protons impinging onto a target ( typically be or graphite )",
    ". however , such conventional beams have some limitations that could be overcome by using new beam - line concepts : @xmath1-beams or neutrino factories . for a comprehensive discussion of future beams and their comparison",
    "we refer to  @xcite and references therein .",
    "one can identify the main components of a conventional neutrino beam line at a high energy accelerator as    * the target onto which protons are sent to produce pions and kaons ; * the focusing system which guides the mesons along the desired neutrino beam direction ; * the decay tunnel ( usually evacuated ) where mesons decay and produce neutrinos and muons .    from meson decay kinematics",
    "it follows that the neutrino energy is given by    @xmath19    where @xmath0 is the lorentz boost of the parent meson , @xmath20 its energy and @xmath21 the angle of the neutrino with respect to the meson flight direction .",
    "there are three types of conventional neutrino beams : the wide band beams ( wbb ) , the narrow band beams ( nbb ) and the off - axis beams ( oab ) .",
    "wbb are characterized by a wide energy spectrum ( they could spread over a couple of order of magnitude ) and correspondingly high neutrino flux .",
    "given these features , wbb are the optimal solution to make discoveries .",
    "the drawback is that , if the signal comes from a small part of the energy spectrum , it could be overwhelmed by the background also induced by neutrinos outside the signal region .",
    "conversely , nbb may produce almost monochromatic energy spectra .",
    "this can be obtained by selecting a small momentum bite of the parent @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "however , the neutrino yield is significantly reduced .",
    "this is an important drawback for oscillation searches .    a good compromise between the requirements of a high flux and a narrow energy spectrum is obtained by means of off - axis beams  @xcite .",
    "this technique involves designing a beam - line which can produce and focus a wide range of mesons in a given direction ( as in the wbb case ) , but then putting the detectors at an angle with respect to that direction . since the pion decay is a two - body decay , a given angle between the pion direction and the detector location corresponds to a given neutrino energy ( almost ) independently of the pion energy .",
    "furthermore , the smaller fraction of high energy tails reduces the background from neutral - current ( nc ) events , which can be misidentified for a @xmath24 charged - current ( cc ) interaction due to the early showering of gamma s from the @xmath25 decay .",
    "it is worth noting that , independent of the adopted solution , there are common problems to all conventional neutrino beams    * the hadron yield in the proton - target interaction has large uncertainties due to lack of data and to theoretical difficulties in describing hadronic processes .",
    "this implies difficulties in predicting the neutrino flux and spectrum with good accuracy ; * in addition to the dominant flavor in the beam ( typically @xmath26 ) there is a contamination ( at the few percent level ) from other flavors ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the knowledge of the beam spectrum and composition has a strong impact both on the precision measurements of the angle @xmath16 , on the mass squared difference @xmath14 and on the sensitivity to the mixing angle @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , from the chooz limit on @xmath2 we know that the @xmath28 appearance probability is smaller than 5% , which is of the same order of magnitude of the beam contamination .",
    "therefore , the observation of @xmath24 appearance and the related @xmath2 measurement are experimentally hard .",
    "consequently , the usage of a close detector , to solve the experimental problem related to the knowledge of the beam , is mandatory .    in the last years a new concept of conventional beam ( the so - called `` super - beam '' ) has been put forward in order to maximize the sensitivity to @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "super - beams will provide a much higher neutrino flux , but at low energy ( below 1 gev ) .",
    "this will open the possibility to perform long - baseline experiments with high statistics and tuned at the oscillation maximum even at moderate distances between source and detector .        in europe a 4  mw superconducting proton linac ( spl )  @xcite , to be built from scratch , would deliver a proton beam ( with energy in the range 2.2  gev  @xcite-3.5  gev  @xcite ) on a hg target to generate an intense ( anti-)neutrino flux from the @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) decay .",
    "this intense neutrino beam , whose fluxes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] , has been proposed to be sent from cern towards the frejus laboratory .",
    "the average energy of neutrinos produced with this facility is of the order of few hundred mev .",
    "the physics potential and the accelerator complex needed for such a super - beam are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein . here",
    ", we only recall that a spl based neutrino program will improve by about one order of magnitude the t2k @xmath2 sensitivity , while it will be able to address neither the cp violation in the leptonic sector nor the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "the spl is the not a mandatory solution for the energy / luminosity upgrade of the lhc  @xcite , while it is an essential component of a neutrino factory complex  @xcite .",
    "the low energy of neutrinos produced with this facility has an important drawback on the detector choice . indeed , in order to compensate the small cross - section and to allow an efficient particle identification huge and low density detectors are mandatory .",
    "the typical detector proposed to exploit a neutrino beam from a spl is a megaton water cerenkov detector  @xcite .",
    "the proposed location for this detector is the frejus laboratory , where a cavern capable to host it should be built .",
    "all in all , we think that an experimental program based on a spl is uprooted with respect to a possible common effort of the elementary particle community in europe .",
    "moreover , it assumes the construction of a million cubic meter cavern capable to host the detector .",
    "last but not least , the neutrino beam has no special advantages ( the main sources of systematics are still there ) with respect to the existing ones , but the higher intensity .",
    "conversely , being a low energy beam one has to deal with a region where fermi motion has an energy comparable with the one of the incident neutrino beam .",
    "consequently it is not possible to measure the neutrino energy spectrum , but only count neutrinos of a given flavour .",
    "the first stage of a neutrino factory is similar to that of a super - beam .",
    "namely , protons are sent onto a target producing pions and kaons that are collected by means of magnetic lenses . however , while in those beams hadrons are let decay launching neutrinos toward the detector site , in a neutrino factory daughter muons are collected and accelerated in a ring with long straight sections .",
    "muon decays in each straight section generate highly collimated neutrino beams . the expected layout for a neutrino factory at cern is shown in fig .  [ fig : nufact ] . if @xmath31 are stored , @xmath32 decays generate a beam consisting of 50% @xmath24 and 50% @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath34 are stored the beam consists of 50% @xmath26 and 50% @xmath35 .",
    "since the kinematics of muon decay is well known , we expect minimal systematic uncertainties on the neutrino flux and spectrum .",
    "hence , compared to conventional neutrino beams , neutrino factories provide @xmath24 and @xmath33 beams or @xmath26 and @xmath35 beams , with small systematic uncertainties on the flux and spectrum .",
    "radiative effects on the muon decay have been calculated and amount to about @xmath36 with a much smaller error .",
    "overall , the flux is expected to be known with a precision of the order of @xmath37 .",
    "another important feature of a neutrino factory beam is its sharp cut - off at the energy of the stored muons . in a conventional neutrino beam",
    "there is a high - energy tail which , as already mentioned , gives rise to background from nc events in which a leading @xmath25 is mis - interpreted as an electron , faking @xmath28 signal .",
    "furthermore , the possibility to store high - energy muons that in turn produce high - energy neutrinos opens the study of oscillation channels like @xmath13 and @xmath38 , whose combined physics potential has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "summarizing , the neutrino factory provides an excellent neutrino beam optimal for both neutrino oscillation searches and other physics  @xcite .",
    "however , it is based on a very challenging technology and it has no relevant overlap with the present ( and future ) cern accelerators .",
    "as far as the exploitation of existing infrastructure , while there is no need for a large cavern to host a megaton detector , the gran sasso halls could be too close , if the neutrino factory is built at cern .",
    "consequently , a new underground laboratory has to be built in order to host the far detector .",
    "it is worth noting that given the very high intensity and high energy of a neutrino factory the far detector will have a reasonable size ( @xmath39 not @xmath40 ) .",
    "a @xmath1-beam  @xcite is made by accelerating radioactive ions with a short beta - decay lifetime , by storing them in a ring with straight sections and by letting them decay .",
    "the focusing of the beam is provided by the lorentz boost .",
    "having the possibility to accelerate either @xmath41 ( e.g. @xmath42he ) or @xmath43 ( e.g. @xmath44ne ) ions , pure @xmath35 or pure @xmath45 beams can be produced , respectively . in order to illustrate the value of the @xmath1-beam concept , we briefly discuss the production of an anti - neutrino beam .",
    "a good beta - emitter for anti - neutrino production is the @xmath46 ion that decays into @xmath47 with a @xmath1-decay endpoint ( @xmath48 ) of about 3.5  mev .",
    "the anti - neutrino spectrum is precisely known from laboratory measurements of the associated electron , since @xmath49 .",
    "since the ion is spin - less , decays at rest are isotropic .",
    "when ions are accelerated ( @xmath0 values up to 150 are possible ) the neutrino transverse momentum in the laboratory frame is identical to that observed in the rest frame , while the longitudinal momentum is multiplied by a factor @xmath0 . therefore , neutrino beam divergence is of the order of @xmath50 ( less than 10  mrad for @xmath51 ) , and the average neutrino energy in the forward direction is @xmath52500  mev .    the technical feasibility of accelerating ions ,",
    "although at relatively low energies , has been already demonstrated in nuclear physics experiments such as at isolde at cern . given the small neutrino energy ,",
    "a potential drawback of this approach is the substantial background from atmospheric neutrinos . to overcome this problem ,",
    "ion beams should be bunched . at present , this is a major technical issue .    in the baseline design ,",
    "the proton driver for a @xmath1-beam is the proposed spl  @xcite .",
    "however , contrary to naive expectation , a multi - megawatt booster is not necessary for the construction of a beta beam or a nuclear physics ( eurisol - like  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , independently of the @xmath0 , a @xmath1-beam requires a @xmath53  kw proton driver operating in the few gev region .",
    "the collection and ionization of the ions is performed using the ecr technique .",
    "hereafter ions are bunched , accelerated and injected up to the high energy boosters .",
    "summarizing , the main features of a neutrino beam based on the @xmath1-beam concept are :    * the beam energy depends on the @xmath0 factor .",
    "the ion accelerator can be tuned to optimize the sensitivity of the experiment ; * the neutrino beam contains a single flavor with an energy spectrum and intensity known a priori .",
    "therefore , unlike conventional neutrino beams , close detectors are not necessary to normalize the fluxes ; * neutrino and anti - neutrino beams can be produced with a comparable flux ; * differently from super - beams , @xmath1-beams experiments search for @xmath54 transitions , requiring a detector capable to identify muons from electrons . moreover , since the beam does not contain @xmath26 or @xmath55 in the initial state , magnetized detectors are not needed .",
    "this is in contrast with the neutrino factories ( see below ) where the determination of the muon sign is mandatory .",
    "a baseline study for a @xmath1-beam complex has been carried out at cern  @xcite .",
    "the sps could accelerate @xmath56  ions at a maximum @xmath0 value of @xmath57 and @xmath58  ions up to @xmath59 . in this scenario",
    "the two ions circulate in the decay ring at the same time . a feasible option provided that their @xmath0 are in the ratio @xmath60 . the reference @xmath1-beam fluxes are @xmath61 @xmath56  useful decays / year and @xmath62 @xmath58   decays / year if the two ions are run at the same time in the complex .",
    "novel developments , suggesting the possibilities of running the two ions separately at their optimal @xmath0  @xcite , have recently triggered a new optimal scheme for the @xmath1-beam . in this scheme",
    "both ions are accelerated at @xmath51 .",
    "the expected fluxes for the baseline scenario are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] .    @xmath1-beam capabilities for ions accelerated at higher energies than those allowed by sps have been computed in @xcite . in the next section we focus on a possible accelerator complex needed to build a @xmath1-beam with @xmath0 in the range 350 - 580 and",
    "we compare it to the baseline design .",
    "we refer in the following to this set - up as the medium @xmath0 scenario .",
    "the choices and timescale for the upgrades of the lhc will depend on the feedbacks from the first years of data taking . still , three phases can already be envisaged  @xcite : an optimization of present hardware ( `` phase 0 '' ) to reach the ultimate luminosity of @xmath63 at two interaction points ; an upgrade of the lhc insertions ( `` phase 1 '' ) and , finally , a major hardware modification ( `` phase 2 '' ) to operate the lhc in the @xmath64 regime and , if needed , prepare for an energy upgrade .",
    "the most straightforward approach to `` phase 2 '' would be the equipment of the sps with fast cycling superconducting magnets in order to inject protons into the lhc with energies of about 1  tev . the 1  tev injection option",
    "( `` super - sps '' ) would have an enormous impact on the design of a @xmath1-beam at cern .",
    "this machine fulfills simultaneously the two most relevant requirements for a high energy @xmath1-beam booster : it provides a fast ramp ( @xmath65  t / s  @xcite ) to minimize the number of decays during the acceleration phase and , as noted in ref.@xcite , it is able to bring @xmath56  up to @xmath66 ( @xmath58  to @xmath67 ) ions in the lhc to reach @xmath68 . for a discussion of this option",
    "we refer to  @xcite . ] .",
    "the mean neutrino energies of the @xmath35 , @xmath45 beams corresponding to a @xmath69 are 1.36  gev and 1.29  gev , respectively . fig .  [",
    "fig : fluxes2 ] shows the @xmath1-beam neutrino fluxes computed at the 735 km baseline , keeping @xmath70 as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "-beam fluxes at the gran sasso location ( 735 km baseline ) as a function of the neutrino energy for @xmath69.,width=283 ]    the increase of the ion energy in the last element of the booster chain represents a challenge for stacking  @xcite",
    ". ions of high rigidity must be collected in a dedicated ring of reasonable size . in the baseline design , this is achieved by a decay ring made of small curved sections ( radius @xmath71  m ) followed by long straigth sections ( @xmath72  m ) pointing toward the far neutrino detector . in this case , the decays that provide useful neutrinos are the ones occurring in the straigth session where neutrinos fly in the direction of the detector and the useful fraction of decays ( `` livetime '' ) is limited by the decays in the opposite arm of the tunnel . for the cern to frejus design the livetime is @xmath73% and the overall length has been fixed to 6880  m. a decay ring of the same length equipped with lhc dipolar magnets ( 8.3  t ) would stack ion at the nominal super - sps rigidity with a significantly larger radius ( @xmath74  m ) . the corresponding lifetime is thus 23% .",
    "the actual intensities that can be achieved with a high energy booster and possible losses with respect to the baseline design still need a dedicated machine study . hence in the following",
    ", physics performances are determined as a function of fluxes .",
    "nevertheless , the looser constrains on the time structure of the beam and the occupancy of the decay ring  @xcite offers a way out for compensation of the losses due to the decrease of the number of decay per unit time .",
    "we remind that the baseline @xmath1-beam design aims at @xmath75  @xmath56  and @xmath76@xmath58  decays per year . fig .",
    "[ fig : complex ] sketches the main components of the @xmath1-beam complex up to injection into the decay ring . in the lower part ,",
    "the machines considered in the baseline option are listed . the alternatives that profit of the upgrade of the lhc injection system are also mentioned ( upper part ) . for a review of technical challenges of @xmath1-beams ,",
    "we refer to  @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the two scenarios can be performed at two different levels : the first one considering the synergies with both the cern accelerator complex and the existing underground laboratories ; the second looking at their physics reach .    from the previous discussions it is straightforward that the baseline scenario presents a strong synergy with the present cern accelerator complex . on the other hand , it could profit of an upgrade of the ps machine . indeed , at the present one of the main limitations comes from the losses in the ps for he that make very difficult the maintenance of the machine .",
    "furthermore , it foresees the construction of a very expensive spl .",
    "conversely , the medium @xmath0 scenario fully exploits the machine upgrades for the lhc energy / luminosity upgrade . at the typical energies of the medium @xmath0 scenario the peak of oscillation probability is comparable to the cern to gran sasso distance .",
    "therefore , it would leverage the existing infrastructure at the gran sasso laboratories as possible site for the far detector .",
    "furthermore , due to the large increase of cross - section the use of dense detectors ( reduction of the detector mass / volume ) would be possible compared with the baseline design .",
    "the latter foresees a megaton water cerenkov detector to be installed in an underground laboratory that should be built from scratch at the frejus site .",
    "one of the problems of the baseline scenario is the measurement of the @xmath26 and @xmath33 cross - sections .",
    "indeed , a near detector may measure with high accuracy the @xmath24 and @xmath35 cross - sections , but the signal ones . on the other hand ,",
    "given the smallness of the neutrino energy , the mass difference between the electron and the muon starts to be important .",
    "the medium @xmath0 has another advantage with respect to the baseline scenario . indeed , while there are already planned experiments aiming at the few percent precision cross - section measurement for both @xmath26 and @xmath33 in the 1 gev region , there are no plans for such a measurements in the few hundred mev region .",
    "therefore , in the baseline scenario one plans to use the spl beam to measure the @xmath26 and @xmath33 cross - sections , while it is not so important for the oscillation measurements  @xcite .",
    "the impact of the systematic error on the cp - violation discovery potential has been studied in ref .",
    "as already pointed out in the previous sections , the main advantage of working with a @xmath1-beam is that there is no need of a magnetized detector to discriminate among neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "the only requirement is a good muon identification in order to observe @xmath26 or @xmath33 coming from @xmath24 or @xmath35 oscillations , respectively .",
    "consequently , working at high ( above 1  gev ) neutrino energies opens the possibility to exploit non - magnetized iron calorimeters , i.e. high density detectors that can operate beyond the `` single ring '' region of water cherenkov and that can be hosted in relatively small underground sites . on top of a good muon identification , these detectors also guarantee the energy measurement of the hadronic shower produced in the neutrino interaction .",
    "the measurement of the muon momentum and of the hadronic shower allows for the reconstruction of the incident neutrino energy .",
    "several experimental techniques can be employed for the detector design . among them , in  @xcite we considered a design derived from a digital rpc based calorimeter proposed for the reconstruction of the energy flow at the ilc detector  @xcite ( dhcal ) .",
    "it consists of a sandwich of 4  cm non - magnetized iron and glass rpc with an overall mass of 40kton .",
    "this detector could be hosted in an underground site of lngs .",
    "the active part of the rpc is segmented in @xmath77 elementary cells .",
    "details on the detector structure and on the performance of the rpc s may be found in ref .",
    "a full monte carlo simulation of the dhcal has been implemented with the geant3 package and validated by comparing its response with pion data with energy in the range from 2  gev to 10  gev  @xcite .",
    "we used the full monte carlo simulation in order to evaluate the detector response , but the event classification capability is only based on inclusive variables ( total number of hits , event length ( expressed in terms of number of crossed iron layers ) ) . the scatter plot of the event length versus the total number of hits of the event is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eveclass ] for neutrinos ( left panel ) and anti - neutrinos ( right panel ) both coming from ions accelerated at @xmath78 .",

    "the typical efficiency for identifying a neutrino or anti - neutrino cc interaction is , averaged out over the whole spectrum , of the order of 50 - 60% .",
    "conversely , the probability for the background to be identified as a cc - like event is smaller than 1% .",

    "as discussed in the previous sections , the expected neutrino flux as a function of the @xmath0 is still under evaluation .",
    "therefore , in the following we evaluate the physics reach as a function of the flux normalized to the one assumed in the baseline design ( @xmath80 ) .",

    "indeed , it turns out that the super - sps option for the luminosity / energy upgrade of the lhc has the ideal features for the construction of a @xmath1-beam facility with a @xmath0 in the range @xmath92 whose physics case would be enormously strengthened in the case of @xmath2 discovery in phase i experiments . given that the luminosity / energy upgrade of the lhc is foreseen after 2015 , and that phase i experiments are expected to complete their program around that date , we see a window of opportunity for a phase ii neutrino program in europe compatible with the lhc ( and its upgrade ) running .",
    "this would allow , contrarily to other proposed neutrino physics program , the full exploitation of european accelerator facilities during the lhc era .",
    "other advantages are that the proposed experimental program does not imply the construction of a megaton detector , but of a very dense detector ( iron slabs interleaved with e.g. glass rpc segmented into @xmath77 cells ) with a few tens of kiloton mass .",
    "this would fit into the underground facilities existing at the gran sasso , whose distance from cern , given the neutrino energy of this facility , happens to be at the peak of oscillation probability !",
    "the proposed detector will be able not only to identify @xmath26 and @xmath33 charged / current interactions , but also to measure the energy of the incident neutrino .",
    "this opens , given the long baseline , the possibility to measure the neutrino mass hierarchy . in",
    "case phase i experiments will discover a non vanishing @xmath2 ( @xmath18 ) , the proposed set - up will be able to discover cp violation for @xmath7 values down to @xmath93 .",
    "these performances are comparable with the one obtained by the baseline @xmath1-beam that foresee the construction of an accelerator complex with no overlap with the lhc program and the excavation of a very large cavern able to host a megaton water cerenkov detector .",
    "note , however , that the sensitivities at small values of @xmath2 of the medium @xmath0 facilities result to be worse than the ones for the baseline @xmath1-beam scenario , mainly due to the large difference of mass ( 40 vs 1000 kton ) of the corresponding detectors .    finally , we want to point out that at the present , although very promising , a detailed study of a @xmath1-beam complex is still missing .",
    "there is an eurisol design study group that is scrutinizing the baseline option , but the medium @xmath0 scenario is beyond its scope .",
    "nevertheless , the latter option surely deserves careful consideration .",
