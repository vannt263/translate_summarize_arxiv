    "the magnetic response of hard type - ii superconductors , in particular magnetic flux creep , is a timely issue in contemporary research ( see for review @xcite ) . in early 60s a very useful model of the critical state was developed to describe magnetic behavior of type - ii superconductors @xcite .",
    "one of the distinguishing features of this behavior , observed experimentally , is that the density of flux lines varies across the whole sample .",
    "this model of the critical state remains in use , even though a significant progress has been made in understanding the particular mechanisms of a magnetization and creep in type - ii superconductors @xcite .",
    "it has also been noted that the magnetic flux distribution in type - ii superconductors is , in many aspects , similar to a sandpile formed when , for example , sand is poured onto a stage @xcite .",
    "when a steady state is reached the slope of such a pile is analogous to the critical current density @xmath0 of a superconductor .",
    "study of the dynamics ( i. e. sand avalanches ) of such strongly - correlated many - particle systems has led to a development of a new concept , called self - organized criticality ( soc ) , proposed originally by bak and co - workers @xcite .",
    "tang first analyzed direct application of soc to type - ii superconductors @xcite .",
    "later numerous studies significantly elaborated on this topic @xcite .    in practice , especially in high - t@xmath1 superconductors , persistent current density @xmath2 in the experiment is much lower than the critical current density @xmath0 due to  giant  flux creep @xcite .",
    "the concept of soc is strictly applied only to the critical state @xmath3 @xcite and it describes the system dynamics _ towards _ the critical state .",
    "nevertheless , it is tempting to analyze magnetic flux creep in type - ii superconductors during which the system moves _ out _ of the critical state , in a soc context , because thermal activation can trigger vortex avalanches @xcite .",
    "however , it was found that modifications of the relaxation law due to vortex avalanches are minor and can hardly be reliably distinguished in the analysis of experimental data .",
    "furthermore , flux creep _ universality _ has been analytically demonstrated in the elegant paper by vinokur _",
    "universality of the spatial distribution of the electric field during flux creep has also been found by gurevich and brandt @xcite .",
    "the direct application of soc to the problem of magnetic flux creep thus meets a number of serious general difficulties .",
    "it is clear that critical scaling ( power laws for vortex - avalanche lifetimes and size distributions ) observed in the vicinity of the critical state @xcite must change during later stages of relaxation due to a time - dependent ( or current - dependent ) balance of the lorentz and pinning forces .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new physical picture of self - organization in a vortex matter during magnetic flux creep in type - ii superconductors . in this approach",
    "the driving parameter is the energy barrier for magnetic flux creep rather than the current density .",
    "we show that notwithstanding its minor influence on the relaxation rate , self - organized behavior may be observed by measuring magnetic noise during flux creep .",
    "we consider a long superconducting slab infinite in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions and having width @xmath6 in the @xmath7 direction . the magnetic field is directed along the @xmath5 axis . in this geometry ,",
    "the flux distribution is one - dimensional , i.e. , @xmath8 . as a mathematical tool for our analysis we use a well known differential equation for flux creep @xcite : @xmath9    here",
    "@xmath10 is the magnetic induction , @xmath11 is the mean velocity of vortices in the @xmath7 direction and @xmath12 is the effective barrier for flux creep .",
    "note that we adopt units with @xmath13 , thus energy is measured in kelvin .",
    "since in our geometry @xmath14 we get for the mean volume magnetization @xmath15 from eq .",
    "[ dbdt ] : @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that we do not modify the pre - exponent factor @xmath18 of eq .",
    "[ dbdt ] or @xmath19 of eq .",
    "[ dmdt ] , as suggested by previous works on soc ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such modifications result only in logarithmic corrections to the effective activation energy , and they may be omitted in a flux creep regime @xcite .",
    "instead , we concentrate on the details of the spatial behavior of flux creep barrier @xmath20 , as analyzed in detail in our previous work @xcite . in that work eq .",
    "[ dbdt ] was solved numerically and semi - analytically for different situations .",
    "we emphasize that , in general , the barrier for flux creep depends on magnetic field @xmath10 , and persistent current density @xmath21 is not uniform across the sample ( see fig .",
    "thus , @xmath2 can not be used as a driving parameter for a soc model .",
    "instead the relevant parameter is @xmath22 , which stays constant across the sample .",
    "also , since experiments on magnetic relaxation are usually carried out at constant temperature and at high magnetic field , we can assume @xmath23 .",
    "central results of ref .",
    "@xcite are shown in fig .",
    "1 using a  collective creep  - type dependence @xmath24 , with @xmath25 and @xmath26as an example , see also eq .",
    "[ griessen ] below ( other models are analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite as well and produce essentially similar results ) .",
    "filled squares in fig .",
    "1 represent the distribution of the magnetic induction @xmath27 at some late stage of relaxation ( so that @xmath28 ) , the solid line represents the normalized current density profile ( note that @xmath29 is constant across the sample ) , and open circles show the profile of the effective barrier for flux creep @xmath30 .",
    "all quantities are calculated numerically from eq .",
    "the important thing to note is that the energy barrier @xmath31 is nearly independent of @xmath7 , so that its maximum variation @xmath32 is of order of @xmath33 .",
    "as also shown from general arguments @xcite , such behavior means that the fluxon system organizes itself to maintain a uniform distribution of the barrier @xmath22 across the sample .",
    "the vortex avalanches are introduced in an integral way .",
    "an avalanche of size @xmath34 causes a change in the total magnetic moment @xmath35 .",
    "this change is equivalent to a change of the average current density @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "if the barrier for flux creep is @xmath38 , then the variation of current @xmath39 leads to a variation of the energy barrier    @xmath40    as mentioned above , maximum fluctuation in the energy barrier @xmath41 is of order of @xmath33 in the creep regime ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "any fluctuation @xmath32 larger than @xmath33 is suppressed before it arrives to the sample edge due to exponential feedback of the local relaxation rate , which is proportional to @xmath43 , ( eq . [ dbdt ] ) .",
    "this means that only fluctuations @xmath44 can be observed in global measurements of the sample magnetic moment .",
    "thus ,    @xmath45    where we denote as @xmath46 the maximum possible avalanche , which depends on time via @xmath47 .",
    "it is worth to note that eq .",
    "[ sm ] gives the correct dependence of @xmath46 on the system size and on temperature .",
    "it is clear that in a finite system the largest possible avalanche must be proportional to the system volume . since it is thermally activated , it is proportional to temperature @xmath33 , consistent with our derivation .",
    "the characteristic time - dependent upper cut - off of the avalanche size was experimentally observed by field _",
    "@xcite who studied magnetic noise spectra at different magnetic field sweep rates , i.e. at different time windows of the experiment .",
    "our central idea is that in the vicinity of @xmath0 the system of fluxons , indeed , exhibits self - organized _ critical _ behavior , as initially proposed by tang @xcite . during flux",
    "creep , it maintains itself in a self - organized , however _ not critical _ state in the sense that it can not be described by the critical scaling .",
    "the self - organization manifests itself by the appearance of almost constant across the sample @xmath22 .",
    "avalanches do not vanish , but there is a constrain on the largest possible avalanche , see eq .",
    "importantly , @xmath46 depends upon current density and , as we show below , decreases with decrease of current ( or with increase of time ) , so their relative importance vanishes .    in order to calculate physically measured quantities",
    "let us derive the time dependence of @xmath46 assuming a very useful generic form of the barrier for flux creep , introduced by griessen @xcite . @xmath48",
    "\\label{griessen}\\ ] ] this formula describes all widely - known functional forms of @xmath49 if the exponent @xmath50 attains both negative and positive values . for @xmath51 eq .",
    "[ griessen ] describes the anderson - kim barrier @xcite ; for @xmath52 the barrier for plastic creep @xcite is obtained .",
    "positive @xmath50 describes collective creep barriers @xcite . in the limit",
    "@xmath53 this formula reproduces exactly logarithmic barrier @xcite . an activation energy written in the form of eq .",
    "[ griessen ] results in an  interpolation formula  for flux creep @xcite if the logarithmic solution of the creep equation @xmath54 is applied @xcite ( for @xmath55 ) : @xmath56 for @xmath57 , a power - law decay is obtained : @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .    using this general form of the current dependence of the activation energy barrier",
    ", we obtain from eq .",
    "[ sm ] @xmath60 and @xmath61 as we see , the upper limit for the avalanche size decreases with the decrease of current density or with the increase of time for all @xmath62 .",
    "for @xmath63 the curvature @xmath64 is negative and largest avalanche does not change with current , but is limited by its value at criticality ) . in this case",
    ", self - organized _ criticality _ describes the system dynamics down to very low currents . on the other hand",
    "the kim - anderson barrier must be always relevant when @xmath65 @xcite , thus our model produces a correct transition to a self - organized critical state at @xmath3 . in practice , most of the observed cases obey @xmath66 and @xmath46 decreases with decrease of current density ( due to flux creep ) .",
    "before starting with calculation of the power spectrum of the magnetic flux noise due to flux avalanches , let us stress that the time dependence of @xmath67 is very weak ( logarithmic , see eq .",
    "[ smtgries ] ) .",
    "this allows us to treat the process of the flux creep as quasi - stationary , which means that during a short time , as required for the sampling of the power spectrum , current density is assumed to be constant . in more sophisticated experiments @xcite the external field can be swept with the constant rate , which insures that the current density does not change , although @xmath28 .",
    "actually , constant sweep rate fixes a certain time window of the experiment @xmath68 .",
    "thus , decreasing the sweep rate allows the noise spectra to be studied at effectively later stages of the relaxation . _",
    "_    once an avalanche is triggered by a thermal fluctuation , its subsequent dynamics is governed only by interactions between vortices for which motion is _ not _ due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "thus , we expect same relationship between the avalanche lifetime @xmath69 and its size @xmath34 as in the case of a sandpile : @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "using the simplified version of the distribution of lifetimes estimated for a superconductor in a creep regime from computer simulations by pan and doniach @xcite ,    @xmath72    and assuming that avalanches of size @xmath34 and lifetime @xmath69 contribute the lorentzian spectrum , @xmath73 the total power spectrum of magnetic noise during flux creep is @xmath74 using eq .",
    "[ rho(tau ) ] we find :    @xmath75 .",

    "the power spectrum @xmath78 described by eq .",
    "[ spectrum ] is plotted in fig .",
    "2 using a solid line . since there",
    "an upper cutoff for the avalanche lifetime at @xmath79 , the lowest frequency which makes sense is @xmath80 .",
    "thus , only frequency domain @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) is important . in the limit of large @xmath83 , the spectral density of eq .",
    "[ spectrum ] has a simple asymptote : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is euler s constant .",
    "this simplified power spectrum is shown in fig . 2 by a dashed line .",
    "for @xmath86 this approximation is quite reasonable .",
    "the usual way to analyze the power spectrum is to present it in a form @xmath87 and extract the exponent @xmath88 simply as @xmath89 . in our case",
    "the parameter @xmath90 is a reduced frequency , so the exponent @xmath88 can be estimated as @xmath91 this result is very important , since it fits quite well the experimentally observed values of @xmath88 which were found to vary between @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite . as seen from fig .",
    "2 , it is impossible to distinguish between real @xmath94 dependence and that predicted by eq .",
    "[ spectrum ] at large enough frequencies .",
    "remarkably , in many experiments the power spectrum was found to deviate significantly from the @xmath94 behavior at lower frequencies , which fits , however , eq .",

    "[ spectrum ] or eq .",
    "[ spectrum1 ] one can find the temperature , magnetic field and time dependence of the power spectrum substituting @xmath95 and using values of @xmath96 derived in the previous section . specifically , from eq . [ smtgries ] we obtain that any given frequency amplitude of a power spectrum increases with time in the collective creep regime , but saturates in the case of the logarithmic barrier and remains constant in the case of the kim - anderson barrier .    in general",
    ", we emphasize that the power spectrum of the magnetic noise during flux creep depends on time .",
    "since parameter @xmath83 decreases with the increase of time , the exponent @xmath88 becomes closer to @xmath92 during flux creep . at these later stages of relaxation",
    "the effect of the avalanches is negligible and magnetic noise is mostly determined by thermally activated jumps of vortices with the usual ( non - correlated ) @xmath97 power spectrum .",
    "thus , the manifestation of the avalanche - driven dynamics during flux creep is noise spectra with @xmath94 and decreasing @xmath98 when sampled at different times during relaxation .",
    "this explains the experimental results obtained by field _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who measured directly vortex avalanches at different sweep rates .",
    "those found that the exponent @xmath88 decreased from a relatively large value of @xmath93 at a large sweep rate of @xmath99 to a smaller value of @xmath100 for a sweep rate of @xmath101 .",
    "this is in a good agreement with our model .",
    "in conclusion , self - organization of vortices in hard type - ii superconductors during magnetic flux creep was analyzed . using results of a numerical solution @xcite of the differential equation for flux",
    "creep , it was argued that the self - organized _ criticality _ describes the system dynamics at @xmath3 . during flux",
    "creep , the vortex system remains_self - organized _ , but there is _ no criticality _ in the sense that there are no simple power laws for distributions of the avalanche size , lifetime , and for the power spectrum . the driving parameter of the self - organized dynamics is the energy barrier @xmath102 and not the current density @xmath2 , as proposed by previous work .",
    "using a simple model the power spectrum @xmath103 of the magnetic noise is predicted to depend on time .",
    "namely , fitting @xmath103 to a @xmath104 behavior will result in a time - dependent exponent @xmath105 decreasing in the interval between @xmath93 and @xmath92 .",
