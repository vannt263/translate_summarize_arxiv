    "cl0024 is a rich , intermediate - redshift cluster ideal for galaxy evolution studies .",
    "one of the two clusters studied by butcher and oemler ( 1978 ) , cl0024 was noted for its high fraction of  blue \" galaxies relative to local clusters . we have surveyed the central region of this cluster with the lris spectrograph to examine the internal kinematics of cluster members as well as the emission signatures of blue disk systems .",
    "we have acquired keck spectra of over 270 objects in the cl0024 field . in table 1 , we compare our data to other recent spectroscopic surveys of this cluster .",
    "note that our spectral wavelength range covers redshifted [ oii ] through h@xmath2 , and our slits are aligned with disk major axes .",
    "we have determined redshifts of nearly 150 cluster members and have confirmed the redshift of the lens source behind this cluster at @xmath3 ( broadhurst et al .",
    "ellis , treu , and collaborators are currently undertaking a spectral survey of galaxies in the outer regions of cl0024 . our data will nicely complement theirs as the majority of the galaxies we have surveyed are concentrated in the cluster center .",

    "( 1997 , morphs ) , in a study of the visually classified morphologies of cluster galaxies , have found evidence that the fraction of s0s in clusters has doubled since @xmath23 . however , other studies of distant cluster s0s suggest that they have red stellar populations similar to those of local cluster galaxies whose stellar populations formed before @xmath24 ( andreon , davoust , & heim 1997 ) .",
    "we have run a preliminary test of the morphs classification of galaxies in the cl0024 field by measuring the bulge - to - total flux ratios ( b / t ) of these galaxies via a two - component model ( devaucouleurs bulge + exponential disk ) .",
    "we find that objects classified by morphs as late types have low b / t , while objects classified as early types tend to span a wider range of b / t .",
    "this result suggests that in distant clusters , disk - dominated systems are being visually classified as bulge - dominated objects ( es and s0s ) , possibly driving up counts of s0s in distant clusters .",
    "we are in the process of running simulations to test the reliability of our models .",
