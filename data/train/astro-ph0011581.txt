    "the w49 complex is composed of one of the most luminous star forming regions in our galaxy ( w49a ) and a relatively young supernova remnant ( w49b ) @xmath13 to the east ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . at high resolution",
    ", w49a is resolved into numerous compact hii regions ( c.f .",
    "dreher et al . 1984 ; de pree et al .",
    "the hii regions to the north ( w49a north ) form a `` ring '' of small ( @xmath14 ) ultra - compact hii regions which appear to have formed during a period of triggered star formation ( c.f .",
    "dickel & goss 1990 ; also see fig .  [ fig2 ] for a magnified view of w49 north ) .",
    "the hii region with the highest emission measure * g * , is associated with a molecular outflow and some of the strongest h@xmath15o masers in the galaxy ( scoville et al .",
    "1986 ; walker , matsakis & garcia - barreto 1982 ) . to the se of w49a north is w49a south which has a rim - brightened cometary shape and may have an edge - on interface with dense molecular gas to the west ( dickel & goss 1990 ; also see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "gwinn , moran , & reid ( 1992 ) recently estimated the distance to w49a to be 11.4 kpc from h@xmath15o maser proper motions .",
    "the giant molecular cloud associated with the w49a star forming region ( as traced by @xmath16co ) has a total mass of several @xmath17 m@xmath18 ( mufson & liszt 1977 ) .",
    "efforts to explain the complex morphology and kinematics of w49a have been abundant , and although progress has been made , thus far no single model can reproduce its observed properties .",
    "low excitation molecular emission lines ( i.e. @xmath16co(@xmath19 ) ) toward w49a are resolved into two components with velocities of @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 and 12 km  s@xmath4 ( mufson & liszt 1977 ) .",
    "such observations led to the suggestion that there are two distinct clouds in the vicinity of w49a , and that their collision is responsible for triggering the observed star - formation ( e.g. mufson & liszt 1977 ; miyawaki , hayashi , & hasegawa 1986 ; serabyn , gsten , & schulz 1993 ) .",
    "however , observations of high excitation ( i.e. @xmath16co(@xmath20 ) ) and low abundance ( i.e. @xmath21co ) lines have revealed the presence of colder , lower density gas at @xmath5 km  s@xmath4 which appears as self - absorption in more abundant species ( jaffe , harris , & genzel 1987 ; phillips et al .",
    "moreover , inverse p cygni profiles with absorption at @xmath22 km  s@xmath4 have been observed in high resolution ( @xmath14 ) observations of hco@xmath23 , nh@xmath24 , and cs toward region * g * which indicate the presence of infall ( welch et al . 1987 ; jackson & kraemer 1994 ; dickel et al .",
    "these facts have been taken to imply that the infalling gas at @xmath22 km  s@xmath4 originates from a `` halo '' component at @xmath5 km  s@xmath4 and is falling onto the the ring of hii regions in w49a north .",
    "attempts to measure rotation in this gas or of the hii regions themselves have been largely unsuccessful or unreliable ( welch et al .",
    "1987 ; jackson & kraemer 1994 ; de pree , mehringer , & goss 1997 ; dickel et al . 1999 ) .",
    "in addition to infall , there is also some evidence for the existence of more than one cloud or a velocity gradient in w49a ( c.f .",
    "dickel et al . 1999 ) .",
    "w49b is estimated to lie at a distance of @xmath25 kpc ( e.g. moffett & reynolds 1994 ; also see  4.2 ) and has one of the highest 1 ghz snr surface brightnesses in the galaxy .",
    "it has a composite morphology with edge brightened radio synchrotron emission but centrally concentrated thermal x - ray emission ( c.f moffett & reynolds 1994 ; smith et al .",
    "the spectral index of w49b is estimated to be @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and the x - ray emission is thought to originate from a reverse shock in the remnant s interior ( green 1988 ; kassim 1989 ; moffett & reynolds 1994 ) .",
    "the presence of such a reverse shock likely indicates that this remnant is young , with an age of @xmath28 years ( smith et al .",
    "moffett & reynolds ( 1994 ; and references therein ) find that the synchrotron emission of w49b has an unusually low fractional linear polarization , despite efforts to detect it at high frequencies and resolutions .",
    "these authors note that the low degree of linear polarization observed toward w49b may be indicative of tangling in the magnetic field lines or faraday depolarization within the snr .    diffuse atomic and molecular gas at lsr velocities of @xmath10 and 60 km  s@xmath4 which does not appear to be physically associated with w49 has also been observed toward w49a and w49b .",
    "some of the species observed in absorption include hi , oh , h@xmath15co , hco@xmath23 and cs ( lockhart & goss 1978 , bieging et al . 1982 ; nyman 1984 ; crutcher , kazs , & troland 1987 ; miyawaki , hasegawa , & hayashi 1988 ; greaves & williams 1994 ) . the excitation requirements of these species suggest molecular hydrogen gas densities in the @xmath29 to @xmath30 @xmath31 range .",
    "the @xmath10 and 60 km  s@xmath4 components are thought to arise from sagittarius spiral arm clouds . since this line of sight passes through the sagittarius arm twice , it is difficult to determine whether these clouds lie at their near or far distances ( e.g. dame et al .",
    "1986 ; jacq , despois , & baudry 1988 ; also see  4.2 ) .    given the wide range of physical conditions that can be sampled by a single observation toward w49  the complex kinematics of w49a , the snr w49b , and diffuse gas at @xmath10 and 60 km  s@xmath4 coupled with the limited resolution of previous w49 hi observations ( @xmath32 ; lockhart & goss 1978 ) we have performed vla hi zeeman observations toward the w49 complex . in particular , we hope to shed some light on the physical processes governing the star formation process(es ) in w49a by imaging the magnetic field strengths and morphology in this intriguing source .",
    "previous vla hi zeeman magnetic field observations toward star forming regions like w3 ( roberts et al .",
    "1993 ) and m17 ( brogan et al . 1999 ) have revealed line of sight field strengths of several hundred @xmath1 g in gas intrinsic to these sources , as well as , complex field morphologies .",
    "the results of our vla hi zeeman absorption observations toward the w49 complex are presented below and are organized in the following order : details of the data reduction and observing parameters are given in  2 ; discussion of the 21 cm w49a and w49b continuum morphology can be found in  3.1 , while the properties of the hi absorption toward w49a and w49b are described in  3.2 ; our hi zeeman magnetic field results are presented in  3.3 ; and finally , the implications of these data are discussed in  4 .",
    "the hi zeeman data reported here consist of 12 hours of vla b - config . and 7 hours of vla d - config . data .",
    "the key parameters for these observations are given in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "we observed both senses of circular polarization simultaneously .",
    "since zeeman observations are very sensitive to small variations in the bandpass , a front - end transfer switch was used to switch the sense of circular polarization passing through each telescope s if system for every other scan .",
    "in addition , we observed each of the calibration sources at frequencies shifted by @xmath33 1.2 mhz from the hi rest frequency to avoid contamination from galactic hi emission at velocities near those of w49 .",
    "the aips ( astronomical image processing system ) package of the nrao was used for the calibration , imaging , cleaning , and calculation of optical depths .",
    "the right ( rcp ) and left ( lcp ) circular polarization data were calibrated separately and later combined during the imaging process to make stokes i@xmath34(rcp + lcp)/2 and stokes v@xmath34(rcp",
    "@xmath35 lcp)/2 data sets .",
    "bandpass correction was applied only to the stokes i data sets since bandpass effects subtract out to first order in the stokes v data .",
    "these hi data were also hanning smoothed during imaging to improve their signal to noise ( s / n ) .",
    "this means that while the channel separation is 0.64 km  s@xmath4 , the velocity resolution is only @xmath36 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the aips task imagr was used to create `` cleaned '' hi line+continuum data sets at four different resolutions : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , 15@xmath2 , and 25@xmath2 .",
    "the 25@xmath2 resolution images were also convolved to a resolution of 40@xmath2 .",
    "note that uniform weighting of these data produces a beam of @xmath14 , while natural weighting produces images with @xmath39 resolution .",
    "data at different resolutions were needed for the wide range of analysis presented here .",
    "for example , the @xmath37 data were used exclusively to create high resolution 21 cm continuum images , the @xmath38 w49a hi line data are compared to h@xmath15co and c@xmath40o data with similar resolutions , while 15@xmath2 is the highest resolution for which were able to make positive magnetic field detections due to s / n constraints .",
    "the 40@xmath2 data were used to search for magnetic field detections with the greatest sensitivity .",
    "the rms noise characteristics and flux density to brightness temperature ( @xmath41 ) conversion factors for each resolution are summarized in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "separate line and continuum data sets were created by estimating and removing the continuum emission in the image plane using imlin for w49a and w49b separately . in this case continuum subtraction in the image plane turned out to be the best option for two reasons : ( 1 ) a greater number of line - free channels could be identified for w49a and w49b individually ; ( 2 ) given the strength of the hi absorption lines toward w49 ( saturated at many positions ) , better s / n was obtained for the line data when the line+continuum were cleaned together ( i.e. where the line is strong very little cleaning is needed  reducing cleaning errors from channel to channel ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows our vla 21 cm continuum image of w49a ( hii region complex ) and w49b ( snr ) at @xmath42 resolution .",
    "this image reveals the main continuum features of w49a and w49b including the numerous individual hii regions present toward w49a and the `` blow out '' morphology of snr w49b toward the ne .",
    "inside the 15 mjy  beam@xmath4 contour level on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the flux density from w49a is @xmath43 jy , while the contribution from w49b is @xmath44 jy .",
    "the rms noise in this @xmath45 image is @xmath46 mjy  beam@xmath4 .",
    "evidently , about half of the 21 cm continuum flux is missing from our synthesis images since single dish estimates of the flux densities of w49a and w49b at 21 cm are @xmath47 jy and @xmath48 jy , respectively ( pastchenko & slysh 1973 ; mezger et al .",
    "higher resolution continuum images of w49a and w49b are discussed in detail below .",
    "continuum images of w49a with @xmath37 resolution at 21 cm and 6 cm are presented in figures  [ fig2]a and b. the 6 cm continuum data were obtained from the vla archive and were originally reported in dickel & goss ( 1990 ) . at this resolution , the wide array of distinct hii regions which make up the w49a complex become apparent ( see also dickel & goss 1990 ; de pree et al .",
    "a number of these hii regions are indicated on figure  [ fig2 ] by their letter designations following the nomenclature of de pree et al .",
    "regions * a*-*l * make up the `` ring '' of hii regions first described by welch et al . ( 1987 ) ( see  1 ) and are indicated by the largest letter symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( due to space limitations only the regions prominent at 21 cm are labeled ) .",
    "the hii regions that are most frequently mentioned by name in the text also have arrows pointing toward them .",
    "also note that with the exception of regions w49a south , * ll * , * s * , and * q * the region shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] is commonly referred to as w49a north .",
    "the most noticeable difference between the 21 cm and 6 cm images presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is the lack of extended structure present in the 6 cm image .",
    "however , this deficit is simply the result of a lack of short spacing information in the 6 cm vla b - array data .",
    "the most significant difference between the continuum emission at these two wavelengths is that the 21 cm continuum emission peaks at hii region * l * , as opposed to region * g * in the 6 cm image .",
    "this apparent lack of agreement is due to the fact that most of the hii regions on the western side of the `` ring '' are optically thick at 21 cm .",
    "indeed , dickel & goss ( 1990 ) found that these western hii regions are even somewhat optically thick at 6 cm from comparison with data at 2 cm ( also see de pree et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig3]a and b show @xmath37 resolution continuum images of w49b at 21 cm .",
    "the continuum contours on fig .",
    "[ fig3]a reveal the small scale synchrotron emission present in the snr , while the greyscale of fig .",
    "3b emphasizes the low surface brightness filamentary and arc like structures present toward the eastern and northern portions of w49b .",
    "these filamentary features are also observed in the multiwavelength w49b continuum images of moffett & reynolds ( 1994 ) . like these authors",
    ", we also note the arc - like appearance of the central and western - most features along with the somewhat helical or twisted appearance of the eastern - most filamentary structure ( also see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] in moffett & reynolds 1994 ) .",
    "moffett & reynolds ( 1994 ) rule out a thermal origin for these filaments based on high resolution ( 15@xmath2 ) spectral index maps created from 90 cm , 21 cm , and 6 cm data .",
    "a number of the hi components toward w49a ( g43.2@xmath350.0 ) and w49b(g43.3@xmath350.2 ) suffer from severe saturation effects , as might be expected from the low galactic latitude and distance to these sources ( @xmath25 to 11 kpc ) .",
    "since saturated channels have an undefined optical depth @xmath49ln@xmath50 $ ] ( where @xmath51 is negative and @xmath52 is positive ; see also roberts et al .",
    "1995 ) , saturation can cause significant underestimates of hi column densities .",
    "this is particularly true of w49a and w49b , because saturated pixels are present even at the continuum peaks for some velocity components . to mitigate this problem",
    "we have used @xmath53\\ ] ] to estimate the largest optical depth value that can be reliably measured at each pixel given the continuum strength ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath54 .",
    "for the @xmath55 ( used for w49a ) and @xmath45 ( used for w49b ) data , @xmath56 mjy  beam@xmath4 .",
    "this `` limiting optical depth map '' was used to replace values in the original optical depth cube wherever the calculated @xmath57 is greater than the limiting value ( i.e. the calculated value is unrealistically large because @xmath58 ) or the calculated value is undefined due to complete line saturation .",
    "note that the optical depths in the channels replaced in this manner are _ lower limits _ to the true values .",
    "in addition , the final optical depth cubes were also masked wherever the continuum brightness is less than 50 and 30 mjy  beam@xmath4 for the @xmath55 and @xmath45 cubes respectively .    while the exact values of the optical depths derived from these `` corrected '' optical depth cubes retain a degree of uncertainty ( i.e. they are lower limits ) , we feel that they better represent the distribution of the hi gas .",
    "however , two caveats should be kept in mind while examining the @xmath59 images presented in  3.2 .",
    "first , despite the obvious advantage of replacing the saturated optical depths with a lower limit ( instead of zero ) , this procedure can introduce a morphological bias which causes the @xmath59 images to artificially resemble the continuum if large regions of the source at a given velocity have been replaced and also where the continuum is weak .",
    "we have tried to minimize this bias by identifying where this effect is present in the sections below .",
    "second , although we present estimates for the hi spin temperature @xmath60 wherever possible ( as deduced from previous observations ) , this is essentially an unknown quantity , and need not be constant positionally within a single component or spectrally for components of similar velocity ( i.e. the hi `` groups '' described below ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath59 images summed over multiple velocity components , in particular , may be biased toward components with low @xmath60 .",
    "the molecular gas intrinsically associated with w49a lies in the velocity range @xmath6 to 25 km  s@xmath4 and is kinematically complex ( see eg .",
    "dickel et al . 1999 ;  1 ) .",
    "there appear to be 5 different heavily blended hi components in this velocity range toward w49a , but no gaussian fitting was attempted due to the complexity of the spectra .",
    "the approximate center velocities of these hi components are 4 , 7 , 10 , 14 , and 18 km  s@xmath4 ( see for example fig . 5 ) .",
    "w49a hi optical depth channel images in the velocity range 0 to 21 km  s@xmath4 with @xmath55 resolution are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . for comparison of the optical depth replacement scheme , the _ top _ set of panels in fig .",
    "4 show @xmath57 masked wherever the displayed channel was saturated or the calculated value exceeds the limiting value ( eq .",
    "1 ) , but _ without _ any replacement , while the _ bottom _ panels have the same masking but saturated and uncertain optical depths have been replaced with lower limits . in both sets of panels ,",
    "every third channel is displayed .",
    "figure 4 shows that the gas near @xmath3 km  s@xmath4 is concentrated toward the ring of hii regions and toward the sw ( regions * s * and * q * ) .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath5 km  s@xmath4 gas is widely spread over all of w49a , with a peak toward region * j*. the @xmath61 km  s@xmath4 hi gas is almost as widely distributed , but shows a @xmath57 minimum between the eastern and western sides of w49a .",
    "the @xmath62 km  s@xmath4 gas has a distribution similar to that at 10 km  s@xmath4 , but has an additional peak towards w49 south .",
    "the lack of hi gas between the w49 north continuum peak and the se regions of w49a suggests that gas between 10 - 16 km  s@xmath4 may arise from two spatially distinct clouds .",
    "the hi gas near @xmath63 km  s@xmath4 has a morphology that is similar to that at @xmath5 km  s@xmath4 ( i.e. widely distributed over the whole source ) .",
    "it is also noteworthy that while these velocity components have somewhat different overall morphologies , all of them peak toward the western side of the w49a ring of hii regions .",
    "the w49a optical depth morphologies between @xmath6 to 25 km  s@xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) show overall agreement with the @xmath32 resolution hi optical depths images presented by lockhart & goss ( 1978 ) .",
    "since these hi data were observed in absorption , they can in principle lie anywhere in front of the source along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , comparison with molecular tracers in the velocity range @xmath6 to 25 km  s@xmath4 ( which are intrinsically associated with w49a ) are needed to establish whether the hi gas in this velocity range is also directly associated with this star - forming region .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows a @xmath38 resolution 21 cm continuum image ( dashed contours and greyscale ) with solid integrated c@xmath40o ( @xmath64 ) emission contours superposed ( summed from @xmath355 to 20 km  s@xmath4 ; dickel et al .",

    "the morphology of the @xmath59 image shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is quite similar to the distribution of c@xmath40o ( @xmath64 ) within the field of view observed by dickel et al .",
    "( 1999 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) in that they both peak toward the western side of the ring of hii regions .",
    "the resemblance of @xmath59 to the continuum toward the low surface brightness regions of w49a is a result of the saturation replacement method .",
    "the @xmath57 profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] also have a velocity extent that is quite similar to the molecular gas tracers h@xmath15co and c@xmath40o indicating that they most likely arise from similar regions in w49a .",
    "one exception is the hi gas near @xmath63 km  s@xmath4 where there appears to be little molecular gas toward any of the w49a hii regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "therefore , excluding the @xmath63 km  s@xmath4 gas , estimates of the spin temperatures ( @xmath60 ) of the hi components between @xmath6 to 17 km  s@xmath4 can be taken from previous dust and molecular line data of w49a .    one reasonable estimate for the hi spin temperature ( @xmath60 ) is the average co(@xmath64 ) kinetic temperature of @xmath69 k estimated by phillips et al . ( 1981 ) .",
    "the @xmath70 jcmt 450 , 800 , and 1100 @xmath1 m images of w49a by buckley & ward - thompson ( 1996 ) show that the dust emission peaks slightly north of region * g * , with secondary peaks toward the sw ( regions * s * and * q * ) , the ne ( region * jj * ) , and w49a south .",
    "the ne dust peak is positionally coincident with the enhancement in @xmath57 observed toward the eastern side of w49a between 10 and 16 km  s@xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "buckley & ward - thompson ( 1996 ) derive dust temperatures toward w49a north of 17 k , 50 k , and 145 k ; the se of 57 k and 210 k ; and sw of 48 k and 240 k ( also see sievers et al .",
    "these authors suggest that the cold dust toward w49 north ( 17 k ) originates from a halo surrounding w49a , while the warm dust at @xmath71 k is associated with the compact hii regions . the hot dust between @xmath72 to 250 k",
    "is thought to be be a minor constituent of the total dust mass .",
    "co(@xmath20 ) observations also indicate the presence of a warm gas component ( @xmath73 ) toward w49a north extending @xmath74 , centered slightly north of hii region * g * ( jaffe et al .",
    "an upper limit to the hi @xmath75 can also be estimated from the lowest 21 cm continuum brightness for which we can still observe hi absorption @xmath72 k ( 25@xmath2 ) , since the background continuum source must be warmer than the foreground absorbing gas .",
    "it seems likely then , that the hi spin temperature in the @xmath6 to 17 km  s@xmath4 range is @xmath76 k.    figures  [ fig7]a and b show @xmath59 images for the velocity ranges 25.5 to 47.4 km  s@xmath4 and 48 to 82 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the hi components in these two velocity ranges are thought to arise from sagittarius arm clouds (  1 ) . the dominant hi velocity components in the @xmath10 km  s@xmath4 group are at @xmath77 and @xmath10 km  s@xmath4 , while the @xmath78 km  s@xmath4 group consists primarily of three components at @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "overall , @xmath59 for the @xmath10 km  s@xmath4 and @xmath11 km  s@xmath4 hi components is fairly uniform over w49a .",
    "the apparent concentration of somewhat higher @xmath59 for the @xmath10 km  s@xmath4 group toward the eastern regions of w49a ( w49a south , * mm * , * kk * ) is real , as is the apparent increase of the @xmath11 km  s@xmath4 @xmath59 toward the nw .",
    "however , these regions also suffered from the most saturation as indicated by the black boxes in fig .",
    "7 , and the strong resemblance of these peaks to the w49a continuum morphology is due to the saturated optical depth replacement scheme .",
    "it is clear from comparison of the greyscale ranges in figs .",
    "[ fig7]a , and b , that the @xmath11 km  s@xmath4 group has the greater overall @xmath59 .",
    "this is because there are more hi components in the @xmath11 km  s@xmath4 hi group ( i.e. greater velocity extent ) since the individual hi lines in both groups have approximately equal line depths .",
    "the individual hi components in both the @xmath10 km  s@xmath4 and @xmath11 km  s@xmath4 velocity ranges have linewidths of @xmath82 km  s@xmath4 . as described above , a reasonable upper limit for @xmath75 can be obtained from the lowest continuum brightness for which we can still accurately measure @xmath57 . in the case of w49a , with 15@xmath2 resolution , this limit is 50 mjy  beam@xmath4 or 150 k.    as mentioned in  1 , gas at these velocities has been observed previously in numerous molecular species in absorption against w49a",
    ". a recent study of these sagittarius spiral arm clouds using cs(@xmath64 ) and cs(@xmath83 ) absorption by greaves & williams ( 1994 ) with @xmath70 resolution show that the velocities of the cs components at @xmath10 km  s@xmath4 and @xmath11 km  s@xmath4 are quite similar to those observed in hi , although the cs line widths ( @xmath84 to 2 km  s@xmath4 ) are about three times narrower .",
    "these authors suggest that the average densities of these clouds are @xmath85 @xmath31 for @xmath86 k based on the relative intensities of the cs transitions .",
    "additionally , greaves & williams find that the @xmath10 km  s@xmath4 @xmath87 is higher than that of the @xmath11 km  s@xmath4 cs gas , in contrast to the higher @xmath59 found for the @xmath11 km  s@xmath4 group in hi .",

    "to do this , it is necessary to assume that the hi zeeman detections reported here reflect the magnetic field strengths in the bulk of the molecular gas in w49a .",

    "it is impossible to determine the significance and implications of this morphology without knowing the plane - of - sky magnetic field direction and magnitude , and the effect of line blending on detecting @xmath0 .",
    "however , two facts are clear from the hi @xmath0 data presented here : ( 1 ) while @xmath0 was only detected at @xmath5  km  s@xmath4 toward the eastern regions of w49a north , this is also the region where the @xmath5  km  s@xmath4 hi gas is most distinct as a separate velocity component ( see also ",
    "4.1.1 ) ; ( 2 ) the @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 component is quite distinct in regions where a significant @xmath0 at this velocity was not detected ( compare for example figs .",
    "12 & 13 ) . from these facts",
    ", we suggest that the confinement of significant @xmath5  km  s@xmath4 @xmath0 to the eastern side of w49a may simply be the result of line blending further west , and that the strong @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 @xmath0 fields are restricted to the nw region of w49a .    in the absence of more data , particularly about the @xmath5  km  s@xmath4 @xmath0 toward the same regions where the @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 @xmath0 is detected , there are many different scenarios that can explain the opposite signs of the @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 and @xmath5  km  s@xmath4 @xmath0 in different parts of the source .",
    "for example , the negative direction of the @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 @xmath0 could be the result of an outflow like the one proposed in  4.1.2 to explain the kinematics of the @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 component ( which is blueshifted with respect to the nearby hii regions ) .",
    "alternantively , the infall of the halo gas reported by dickel et al .",
    "( 1999 ; also see  1 ) could also potentially play a role in the apparent field reversal .",
    "further progress in understanding the magnetic field morphology of this complex source will have to await future linear polarization and molecular zeeman observations .",
    "figure  [ fig16 ] compares the average 25@xmath2 resolution hi optical depth toward w49a with that observed toward w49b . before calculating the average ,",
    "the optical depth cubes were masked wherever the 21 cm continuum flux is less than 30 mjy  beam@xmath4 .",
    "the overall shapes of the average @xmath57 profiles toward w49a and w49b shown in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] ( upper panel ) are very similar to those presented in lockhart & goss ( 1978 ) using the owens valley interferometer with @xmath32 resolution . however , the magnitudes of the average optical depth profiles shown here are smaller by about a factor of 1.5 .",
    "this discrepancy is caused by our replacement of saturated and uncertain optical depths with conservative lower limits .",
    "this procedure underestimates @xmath57 , especially toward the weaker parts of the continuum ( see  3.2 ) , causing an overall lowering of the average optical depth . since",
    "this method was applied equally to w49a and w49b it should not change the relative differences between them . indeed , the similarity of the average w49a(@xmath155w49b(@xmath57 ) profile presented in fig .  [ fig16 ]",
    "( lower panel ) to the one shown in lockhart & goss ( 1978 ) suggests this is the case .",
    "although the distance to w49a has been accurately determined to be 11.4 kpc from h@xmath15o maser proper motion studies ( gwinn et al . 1992 ) , the distance to w49b remains uncertain .",
    "given that there is strong hi absorption up to velocities of @xmath156 km  s@xmath4 for both w49a ( g43.2@xmath350.0 ) and w49b ( g43.3@xmath350.2 ) , it is clear that w49b must lie beyond the tangent point at @xmath157 kpc ( using galactic center distance of 8.5 kpc ) .",
    "in addition , since the hi absorption toward w49b does not extend to negative velocities , the snr must also lie within the solar circle at @xmath158 kpc . in the past ,",
    "comparison of the average @xmath57 profiles w49a and w49b have also been used to estimate the distance to w49b . the major difference between the average hi optical depths toward w49a and w49b",
    "is the absence of hi absorption at velocities between @xmath5 to 14 km  s@xmath4 and @xmath71 to 55 km  s@xmath4 toward w49b ( see also lockhart & goss 1978 ; radhakrishnan et al . 1972 ) .",
    "indeed , the greater overall optical depth toward w49a from @xmath5 to 14 km  s@xmath4 and in the @xmath11 km  s@xmath4 components has been used in the past to suggest that w49a lies farther away than w49b by @xmath153 kpc ( kazs & rieu 1970 ; radhakrishnan et al .",
    "1972 ) .",
    "we do not find clear evidence in the high resolution hi data present here that this is the case .",
    "for example , the @xmath159 images in all velocity ranges toward both w49a and w49b show noticeable changes on size scales of @xmath160 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] ,  [ fig7 ] , and  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "therefore , given the @xmath13 separation between them , it is not surprising that there are significant variations in the average optical depth profiles toward w49a and w49b regardless of their relative distances . indeed , although the average @xmath57 from 50 to 58 km  s@xmath4 is stronger toward w49a , there appears to be more hi gas in the @xmath80 to 65 km  s@xmath4 range toward w49b ( fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] ) .",
    "also , while there is a complete absence of hi absorption at velocities between @xmath5 to 14 km  s@xmath4 toward w49b , there are a number of scenarios involving differences in kinematics , distribution , and temperature that could explain this behavior without assuming that w49b is closer . in any case ,",
    "conversion of the excess w49a @xmath5 to 14 km  s@xmath4 @xmath159 to the distance between w49b and w49a strongly depends on the assumed density and temperature of the hi gas .",
    "for example , if the @xmath5 to 14 km  s@xmath4 hi absorption arises from the w49a halo component as suggested in  4.1 , ( @xmath161 @xmath31 and @xmath162 k ) , then the necessary line of sight separation between w49a and w49b reduces to @xmath84 pc compared to the 3 kpc obtained by kazs & rieu 1970 ( also see radhakrishnan et al .",
    "1972 ) . summarizing ,",

    "therefore , the hi gas in this velocity range is likely to originate near the w49a star - forming complex .",
    "significant line of sight magnetic fields toward w49a were detected in two different hi velocity components .",

    ", it seems likely that the @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 hi component is directly associated with the northern part of the hii region ring , while the @xmath5  km  s@xmath4 hi component seems to originate in a lower density halo surrounding w49a .    from previous molecular line and dust observations of w49a",
    ", we estimate that the w49a north core ( @xmath163 in extent ) is significantly subvirial , with 2@xmath7/@xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "in addition , it appears that the total magnetic energy ( assuming @xmath142 @xmath1 g and @xmath147@xmath164 @xmath7 ) only contributes 0.1@xmath8 . adding the different energy contributions , we estimate that the total kinetic + magnetic energies only amount to less than about 1/3 of the total gravitational energy .",
    "indeed , we find that @xmath165 mg is needed for there to be overall equilibrium in w49a north ( ignoring external pressure ) . therefore , while it must be emphasized that the parameters used in these estimates are fairly uncertain , these new magnetic field results suggest that w49a north is unstable to overall gravitational collapse as implied by evidence that the halo is collapsing onto the w49a north ring of hii regions ( e.g. dickel et al . 1999 ) .",
    "there are four main hi velocity groups detected toward w49b with velocities of @xmath11 , @xmath10 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 km  s@xmath4 .",
