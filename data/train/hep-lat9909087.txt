    "dynamical fermion simulations are still one of the challenging problems in lattice qcd .",
    "recently , a lot of work has been devoted to developing improved lattice fermion actions . in this paper , we report our findings on improved kogut - susskind fermions . in particular , we focus on the issue of flavor symmetry , and the construction of an action suitable for dynamical simulations .",
    "kogut - susskind ( ks ) fermions have @xmath0 lattice artifacts , in contrast to the wilson fermions which have @xmath1 .",
    "they represent four degenerate quark flavors with a @xmath2 symmetry in the continuum .",
    "this symmetry is broken down to a @xmath3 on the lattice .",
    "this remnant symmetry protects against additive mass renormalizations .",
    "the @xmath2 symmetry breaking manifests itself in mass splittings in the pion spectrum .",
    "there is only one goldstone pion associated with the exact @xmath4 chiral symmetry , while the rest of the fifteen pions  @xcite are non - goldstone massive particles .",
    "the first step towards improving the ks action was made by naik .",
    "he introduced the so called `` naik term '' ( @xmath5 ) , which eliminates a tree level @xmath0 artifact , improving the lorenz symmetry ( dispersion relation ) .",
    "the remaining order @xmath0 artifacts are the @xmath2 breaking terms .",
    "as lepage  @xcite pointed out , these terms are due to couplings to high momentum gluons , which cause scattering of lattice quarks among the corners of the brillouin zone .",
    "these scatterings correspond to spin - flavor transformations of the physical quark field , causing the breaking of the symmetry .",
    "thus , the way to reduce the symmetry breaking is to smear  @xcite the quark - gluon vertex , which suppresses the couplings to high momentum gluons .",
    "recently , it was shown by lepage  @xcite that the one gluon exchange interaction at high momentum is identical to 4-fermi @xmath2 breaking terms .",
    "consequently , these effects can be canceled by either appropriate smearing of the quark - gluon vertex , so that high momentum gluons decouple , or by including in the action appropriate 4-fermi terms .",
    "since the @xmath2 symmetry breaking occurs due to coupling to high momentum gluons , we need to modify the quark - gluon vertex in order to decouple them .",
    "the coupling of quarks to a gluon @xmath6 with any of its transverse momentum components @xmath7 causes quark scattering among the corners of the brillouin zone .",
    "couplings to gluons with longitudinal momentum @xmath8 vanish due to cancellations between the forward and the backward part of the dirac operator , consequently we do not need to worry about them .",
    "there are 3 independent couplings to high transverse momentum gluons ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we can eliminate them by modifying the gauge link used in the lattice derivative as following :    @xmath10   \\label{smearing}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath11    it is not difficult to see that the above set of terms is the simplest needed to eliminate completely couplings to high momentum gluons .    in the weak coupling limit",
    ", the couplings ( @xmath12,@xmath13 , @xmath14 ) to the gauge field with one , two or three of the transverse momentum components @xmath15 can be expressed as functions of the staple couplings @xmath16 , and the single link coupling @xmath17 : @xmath18 the overall normalization condition @xmath19 is used to ensure that the total coupling to the nearest neighbor in the free field limit is one . the solution to the equations",
    "@xmath20 is @xmath21 .",
    "this set of parameters defines our `` fat7 '' action .",
    "the `` fat5 '' action is constructed by using paths up to length 5 , minimizing the maximum of the couplings @xmath22 .",
    "the `` fat5 '' couplings are @xmath23 , @xmath24 , which give @xmath25 . adding the naik term to the `` fat7 '' action results in an action with no tree level @xmath0 errors and improved flavor symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , the extra couplings introduced to fix the high momentum behavior introduce a low momentum artifact @xmath26 . in order to correct this new artifact",
    ", one has to introduce a new term discovered by lepage  @xcite .",
    "this new term is a double staple @xmath27 with weight @xmath28 .",
    "cancellation of the new artifact occurs , if @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "note that because the new term couples to a distance 2 in the @xmath31 direction , at momentum @xmath7 it acts as a single link term .",
    "for this reason , the above change of couplings preserves the normalization condition and keeps the couplings @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 zero .",
    "adding the naik term , ( @xmath5 ) we get an action which we call `` asq '' , that has errors of @xmath32 .",
    "all the above actions can be tadpole improved . for the tadpole",
    "improved actions , we append the suffix `` tad '' to the names above .    motivated by the success of rg inspired ape smeared actions in the work of degrand , hasenfratz and collaborators  @xcite , we also decided to approximate ape smeared actions as a set of paths with appropriate weights .",
    "this is necessary , if we want to use such actions in dynamical simulations . in  @xcite",
    "we show how this approximation can be done expanding in powers of the ape smearing parameter @xmath33 . for one ape smearing with @xmath34 , and to",
    "leading order in @xmath33 we get the action we call `` ofun25 '' ( once fattened unitarized @xmath34 ) . the fat link for this action is : @xmath35",
    "our action tests are focused on the flavor symmetry restoration , since we have established in our previous studies  @xcite that the naik term improves lorenz symmetry adequately for the lattice spacings used in current simulations .",
    "furthermore , the naik term has little effect on flavor symmetry .",
    "thus , in most of the smearing variants we use , we do not include the naik term .",
    "we include the naik term into `` asq '' and `` asqtad '' , since these actions are the candidates for an action with both improved flavor and rotational symmetry .",
    "the flavor symmetry breaking is estimated by the splittings in the pion spectrum .",
    "spectroscopy is done on the same set of lattices ( sample sizes range from 48 to 60 ) for all the actions tested .",
    "we use @xmath36 @xmath37 lattices with two dynamical quark masses @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and @xmath40 @xmath41 lattices with dynamical quark masses @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the gauge action is 1-loop symanzik improved and the sea quark action is kogut - susskind with a staple and a naik term  @xcite .",
    "we also use a set of @xmath44 quenched lattices at @xmath45 with wilson gauge action .",
    "the pion spectra are computed for the two different masses in the case of the dynamical lattices and for @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the case of the quenched lattices .",
    "we then interpolate the results to @xmath48 .",
    "the interpolated spectra are shown in figure  [ figure ] . in this figure",
    ", we also show for comparison the spectrum of the standard ks action ( ol ) and the spectrum of the action used for the dynamical quarks(ofn ) .",
    "our results in figure  [ figure ] show that there is a significant improvement of the flavor symmetry as we increase the suppression of the high momentum gluon couplings .",
    "the highest improvement is observed for the `` fat7tad '' and `` asqtad '' actions where couplings are set to zero at tree level .",
    "for all the actions the tadpole variant is better than the non - tadpole .",
    "the approximately reunitarized action `` ofun25 '' is slightly better than the `` ofn '' . in all cases",
    "the spectrum exhibits the degeneracies suggested in  @xcite . for a detailed error analysis that better justifies our claims",
    "see our recent publication  @xcite .",
    "although the differences in flavor symmetry improvement among the various highly smeared actions seem small , we favor `` asqtad '' on theoretical grounds ( @xmath32 errors ) , and on our estimation that it only costs a factor of 2 - 3 for dynamical simulations with light quarks .",
    "we believe that such an action will be useful in realistic projects with dynamical quarks ."
