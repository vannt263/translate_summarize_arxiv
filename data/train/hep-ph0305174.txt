    "suppression of the _ j_/@xmath0 signal in heavy ion collisions is still considered one of the promising probes of our attempts to push back deconfinement and open up a four volume of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) from the vacuum wherein quarks and gluons have their confinement scale extended to macroscopic lengths .",
    "the greatest four volume that one can hope for in the laboratory at present is about 10@xmath1 fm@xmath1 since stable nuclei are of limited size ( @xmath3 10 fm ) and system longevity is expected to be of the order 10 fm . any yet , dynamical scales for strong interaction physics are at the femtometer and subfemtometer level , and so it is quite reasonable to approximate the system as being relatively large , relatively long - lived , and near thermal equilibrium .",
    "then , kinetic theory of asymptotic states and vacuum cross sections is a useful tool to establish the baseline rates for various dynamical effects .",
    "the mechanism for suppression of @xmath4 suggested by matsui and satz@xcite originates from color screening in qcd plasma which is clearly absent in hot hadronic matter .",
    "screening would effectively `` partonize '' the bound state mesons ( the qcd analog of ionization in atomic physics ) into open subsystems with colour ( quarks , antiquarks and glue ) . for charm",
    ", this possibility brings forward a probe of open ( @xmath5 mesons ) versus hidden ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "open charm decays mostly semileptonically , and will therefore be absent in an invariant mass window of say , muon pairs near the @xmath4 mass .",
    "therefore , a partial or total absence of a strong @xmath4 peak could indicate the presence of qgp .    in order for the probe to be useful",
    ", hidden charm must be relatively unreactive to hadrons to survive the hadronic stage of the fireball .",
    "for instance , we do not expect suppression of the @xmath6 to be a qgp signal because the @xmath6 interacts with light mesons such that its mean free path is of the order 25 fm@xcite .",
    "we ask , could the same effects spoil charm@xmath4 that most likely spoil strangeness@xmath6 from utility ?",
    "our purpose here is to assess within an effective field theory the interaction cross sections of @xmath4 with light mesons ( pions , rho mesons , etc . ) and to further estimate the breakup rates .",
    "the hope is that such activity might shed some light on the extent to which suppression of the @xmath4 as a plasma indicator is emulated by purely hadronic effects .",
    "quantum chromodynamics at low energies is particularly challenging . lattice technology , for example , has not yet advanced to the stage where one can do dynamical studies at finite temperature .",
    "we instead resort to very successful methods of effective lagrangian descriptions for the hadronic degrees of freedom . while the symmetry arguments typically introduced for two light quark flavours are not as clearly applicable when generalizing to three and four flavours , we indicate , as is usually done , that symmetry breaking effects are relegated entirely to physical mass eigenstates , leaving the interaction completely symmetric from the beginning .",
    "the guiding principles are therefore chiral symmetry , unitarity , and gauge invariance .",
    "we start with a nonlinear sigma model @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and @xmath6 is the pseudoscalar meson matrix appropriately generalized to include charm , thereby becoming 4@xmath94 , and @xmath10 = 135 mev is the pion decay constant .",
    "a chiral covariant derivative @xmath11 introduces vector and axial vector fields and their respective coupling to pseudoscalars .",
    "kinetic energy terms for spin 1 fields and generalized mass terms of the left- and right - handed fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 are introduced . then , the axial vector fields are gauged away leaving to lowest order a set of interactions for light plus heavy pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "the interactions are compactly written as@xcite @xmath14\\right ) - { g^{\\,2}\\over\\/2\\/}{\\rm\\/tr\\/}\\left ( \\left[\\phi,\\,\\rho^{\\mu}\\,\\right]^{\\,2\\/}\\right ) + i\\,g\\,{\\rm\\/tr\\/}\\left(\\partial_{\\mu}\\rho_{\\nu}\\left[\\rho^{\\mu},\\,\\rho^{\\nu } \\,\\right]\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & \\ & + { g^{\\,2}\\over\\/4\\/ } { \\rm\\/tr\\/}\\left(\\left[\\rho^{\\mu},\\,\\rho^{\\nu}\\right]^{\\,2\\/}\\right)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is also generalized to encompass charm and is therefore a 4@xmath94 matrix of vector mesons .",
    "if the symmetry were perfectly realized in nature , the chiral coupling constant @xmath16 would alone be sufficient to describe the interaction strengths universally .",
    "we relax that requirement here and appeal to experimental results and model calculations via qcd sum rules for fitting the coupling constants at each three - point vertex .",
    "gauge invariance then restricts the four - point functions .    a recent measurement of @xmath17 = 96 @xmath184 @xmath18 22 kev@xcite fixes the value of the coupling constant @xmath19 = 6.39 . coupling of the @xmath4 to @xmath20 and to @xmath21 vertices is also required as input to calculate the pion - included breakup cross section for @xmath4 .",
    "using strict vector dominance , which has been done several times in the past@xcite , the coupling constants would be @xmath22 = @xmath23 = 7.7 . in the next section",
    "we indicate an alternative approach of extracting not only the coupling strengths but also momentum dependence at the vertices from qcd sum rules .",
    "the @xmath24-induced inelastic reactions require further information via coupling constants .",
    "vector meson dominance and chiral symmetry would lead to @xmath25 = @xmath26 = 5.6@xcite .",
    "we alternatively look to qcd sum rules for information on the coupling strengths and momentum dependences , described below .",
    "hadrons are clearly composites of the underlying quarks whose ( effective ) fields describe pointlike physics only when all the interacting particles are on mass - shell .",
    "as soon as at least one of the particles in a vertex is pushed kinematically off - shell , the finite size effects become important .",
    "this is of course not true for gauge field theories ( _ e.g. _ qed , qcd ) whose degrees of freedom are structureless .",
    "one way to account for this is to use the effective lagrangian to construct higher order processes ( vertex corrections , loop corrections to propagators , etc . ) and to formulate strategies for renormalization .",
    "this has not been done up to now .",
    "however , the same physics has been modelled using qcd sum rules to extract the momentum dependence of the vertex coupling constants which then `` run '' with the relevant squared four momenta contacting the vertex@xcite .",
    "the basic scheme is to use on the one hand , wilson s operator product expansion to write the vertex , and on the other , phenomenolgy in the form of borel transformations to write the same function as linear combinations of relevant four momenta . running coupling constants",
    "have been obtained as follows@xcite    @xmath27 } \\",

    ". these values are different by tens of percents from the chiral symmetry assumption and strict vector meson dominance .",
    "we next illustrate our gauge invariant method of implementing form factors for the channel @xmath33 .",
    "notice from fig .",
    "[ feynf ] that there are three feynman graphs contributing to the scattering amplitude : a _ t_-channel , _",
    "u_-channel , and a four - point graph .",
    "the full amplitude becomes @xmath34 where the superscript `` 0 '' indicates amplitudes without form factors ( without running couplings ) modulo the coupling constants , and where the four - point amplitude is evaluated only after replacing `` @xmath35 '' with @xmath36 , where @xmath37 gauge invariance restricts the expansion coefficients @xmath38 , albeit not uniquely .",
    "a lorentz and gauge - invariant solution is the following @xmath39    this strategy accommodates extended hadrons and is applied to all processes , including @xmath24-induced channels . before coming to the results",
    ", we reiterate the features of our form - factor implementation and underscore the importance of using    * form factors which are covariant , * unique form factors at each vertex which are appropriate for the specific kinematics introduced at that vertex ( rather than some average momentum transfers over all graphs ) , and * an approach where gauge invariance is strictly respected .",
    "giving up on lorentz invariance , gauge invariance , or failing to insist on the proper kinematics for each form factor should be considered less reliable and therefore unacceptable .",
    "cross sections for @xmath4 dissociation are inaccessible experimentally .",
    "it is therefore crucial to have reliable estimates for the magnitude and energy dependence of such quantities .",
    "only then can we address the earlier question regarding the extent to which the @xmath4 is unreactive to light hadrons .",
    "we report in fig .",
    "[ xsections ] the results of some of the pion and rho meson induced breakup cross sections as functions of energy .",
    "the near - threshold and energy dependences are nontrivial and the magnitudes of the cross sections are several millibarns .",
    "we note that quark - exchange models have recently given cross sections of the order 1 mb@xcite .",
    "we further note that while the magnitude of the cross sections here are similar to other recent meson - exchange models , the energy dependence is quite different owing to different form factors and different implementation@xcite .",
    "reaction rates within a fireball @xmath40 are also important indicators of spatial and temporal scales@xcite . here",
    "we use the formalism from ref.@xcite to write the @xmath4 spectral function as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the scalar part of the @xmath4 propagator .",
    "if we neglect the difference between longitudinal and transverse polarizations of the @xmath4 in the finite temperature medium @xcite , then we have @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the scalar imaginary self - energy .",
    "then , using @xmath46 we write @xmath47 where @xmath48 contains the vacuum width and the contributions from inelastic scattering with pions and rhos .",
    "the spectral function resulting from this calculation appears in fig .",
    "[ sfunction ] .",
    "we fix the temperature at values of 150 and 200 mev , which are relevant values for heavy ion experiments .",
    "four different values of @xmath4 momenta are chosen for each .",
    "we analyze the spectral function this way since there is no expectation that the @xmath4 s will be thermal .    the spectral function for the @xmath4 is clearly modified at finite temperature due to interactions with hadronic matter .",
    "breakup rates fed into the spectral function range from 5 to 30 mev .",
    "we have applied an effective lagrangian to describe the dynamics of @xmath4 with particular focus on breakup reactions induced by light unflavoured mesons .",
    "off - shell effects at the vertices were handled with qcd sum rule estimates for the running coupling constants , _",
    "i.e. _ the three - point functions . analytic continuation to the poles ( on - shell mesons ) gave further guidance to constrain couplings .",
    "four - point functions were first expanded over general lorentz structures and then constrained with ward identities .",
    "the formalism is then covariant , gauge invariant , and consistently describes on a graph - by - graph basis the kinematics and the off - shell vertex functions .",
    "the model uses effective field theory , qcd sum rules for the form factors , and ward identities to constrain the overall scattering amplitudes .    resulting cross sections for breakup of @xmath4",
    "are several millibarns , and exhibit nontrivial energy dependence . when imported to the spectral function , the resulting effects give a dramatic modification at finite temperature as compared to vacuum structure .",
    "this could have important consequences for studies at sps and rhic measuring dilepton signals near the @xmath4 mass and impact interpretation of @xmath4 suppression .",
