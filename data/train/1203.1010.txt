    "when @xmath246 most chaotic orbits escape to the bumpy black hole .",
    "however , only a proportion @xmath109 escape directly from the system without any further intersection with the axis @xmath165 . this proportion increases as the energy @xmath157 decreases ( fig . [ figcharep]b ) .",
    "the curve @xmath109 of fig .",
    "[ figcharep]b is very similar to the corresponding curve of fig .",
    "[ fig:10]b . in fig .",
    "[ figepmfs ] we mark in red the initial conditions of the directly escaping orbits .",
    "most of the other chaotic orbits escape after one or more intersections beyond the original point , with the @xmath165 axis .",
    "but , as we see in fig",
    ". [ figepmfs ] , for @xmath246 there are also orbits that do not escape . in particular the periodic orbit @xmath166 and orbits close to it do not escape for much smaller values of @xmath157 .",
    "similarly the orbits that bifurcated from @xmath209 , like the orbits @xmath247 ( fig .",
    "[ figepmfs ] ) exist also for @xmath246 .",
    "however , all these families become unstable for small @xmath157 . in any case",
    "the existence of an infinity of families of unstable periodic orbits is a similar phenomenon as the one observed in the system ( [ func : ham ] ) .",
    "we considered the periodic orbits and escapes in two quite different dynamical systems in order to find their common features .",
    "the first system is a system of two coupled oscillators , while the second system is a perturbation of the kerr metric in general relativity .    in the system ( [ func : ham ] ) escapes occur when the curves of zero velocity open and many orbits escape to infinity . in the second case",
    "we have escapes to infinity , but we emphasized the escapes to the central bumpy black hole . in both cases when the energy changes and reaches the escape value , there is a periodic orbit that approaches the point where the czv opens and its period tends to infinity .",
    "thus , the family of periodic orbits terminates at the escape energy . before the escape energy this family undergoes an infinity of transitions from stability to instability and vice - versa , and at every transition",
    "there is a bifurcation of an equal or double period family of periodic orbits , that does not escape as the energy varies .",
    "another common feature is that most chaotic orbits become escape orbits beyond the escape energy ( beyond means larger energy in the first system , but smaller energy in the second system ) .",
    "however , for energies slightly beyond the escape energy most orbits take a rather long time to escape . as the energy increases ( decreases ) the proportion of fast escapes increases considerably",
    "the proportion of chaotic ( @xmath115 escaping ) orbits increases abruptly as the energy goes beyond the escape energy .",
    "we studied the structure of the phase space and we distinguished the ordered and chaotic domains .",
    "the ordered domains surround the positions of the stable periodic orbits .",
    "thus we found these periodic orbits and their bifurcations as the energy varies . on the other hand ,",
    "the chaotic domains surround the asymptotic curves from the unstable periodic orbits .      in the first case ( of two coupled oscillations )",
    "we found the characteristics of the periodic orbits and their stability .",
    "then we found the structure of the phase space on a surface of section for various values of the energy .",
    "as the energy increases the chaotic domains increase , while all stable periodic orbits become unstable .",
    "( however , new stable periodic orbits appear for larger energies at tangent bifurcations . )",
    "the chaotic domains are covered by the asymptotic curves of a main unstable periodic orbit . as the energy goes beyond the escape energy most chaotic orbits escape , either directly , or after a small or a large number of intersections with the @xmath106=0 axis .",
    "some asymptotic curves are split into successive pieces , each piece making infinite rotations around an escape domain .",
    "the statistics of chaos and escape are given by different graphs : ( a ) ( b ) the proportion of chaotic and escaping orbits and the proportion of the directly escaping orbits as functions of the energy , ( c ) ( d ) the proportion of the escaping orbits at the @xmath113th intersection with respect to the initial total number of orbits and with respect to the remaining orbits , as functions of the number of iterations ( which represents time ) .",
    "in the system ( [ func : mnmetric ] ) ( manko - novikov metric ) we found various forms of the czvs for various values of the energy , and the corresponding simple periodic orbits .",
    "we found also surfaces of section with mostly ordered orbits , for relatively large energies @xmath157 ( but @xmath2451 ) , or a mixture of ordered and chaotic orbits for smaller energies .",
    "we found the characteristics of the main families of periodic orbits and their bifurcations .",
    "we emphasized the appearance of a couple of periodic orbits ( one stable , and one unstable ) at a tangent bifurcation , and their evolution .",
    "as the energy decreases the stable family undergoes an infinity of bifurcations ( at transitions from stability to instability and vice versa ) .",
    "as the energy goes below a critical value the period of this orbit goes to infinity and then this orbit escapes to the bumpy black hole and this family of periodic orbits terminates .    on the other hand ,",
    "the bifurcating families exist and do not escape , but become unstable .",
    "we found the proportion of the chaotic regions as the energy decreases . beyond the critical energy most of the chaotic region",
    "contains escape orbits .",
    "the proportion of the chaotic@xmath115escaping orbits increases abruptly below the escape energy and tends to @xmath107 for smaller energies .",
    "it is remarkable that these quite different systems have very similar forms of the proportion of chaotic orbits ( figs .",
    "[ fig:10]a and [ figcharep]a ) and of the proportion of directly escaping orbits ( figs .",
    "[ fig:10]b and [ figcharep]b ) .",
    "the relations of the periodic orbits with the chaotic and escaping orbits are also quite similar .",
    "these similarities indicate that the properties of periodic , ordered , chaotic and escaping orbits that we studied in the present paper are very similar in generic dynamical systems .",
