    "it is compelling that most of the matter in the universe is in a form of non - baryonic cold dark matter .",
    "if it exists , it would play an important role in the structure formation of the universe  @xcite .",
    "axions , the pseudo - goldstone bosons , are among the most promising candidates for the non - baryonic cold dark matter .",
    "they arise from the spontaneous breaking of a global @xmath0 symmetry of peccei and quinn ( pq ) , which is introduced to solve the strong cp problem of qcd  @xcite . in the standard big - bang cosmology ,",
    "after the spontaneous breakdown of the pq symmetry , the expectation value of the axion field ( i.e. the axionic condensate ) takes some random value on the interval @xmath1 $ ] and , is approximately constant over length scales which are smaller than the horizon size  @xcite .",
    "if inflation occurs either after or during the pq symmetry breaking , then the expectation value can be nearly constant throughout the entire universe  @xcite . at high temperatures above the @xmath2 scale ,",
    "the axion is massless ; however , at low temperatures , the axion develops a mass due to qcd instanton effects  @xcite .",
    "once the axion mass becomes greater than the universe expansion rate , the expectation value of the axion field begins to oscillate coherently around the minimum of its effective potential that is near the origin .",
    "the oscillating axion field then dissipates mainly due to the universe expansion as well as particle production  @xcite .    in the original papers  @xcite , simple estimates of the thermal dissipation of the homogeneous axionic condensate were given .",
    "they considered instabilities arising from the parametric amplification of quantum fluctuations that could pump the energy of the homogeneous axionic condensate into its quantum fluctuations via self couplings , as well as into quantum fluctuating photon modes via a coupling of the axion to electromagnetism due to the color anomaly of the pq symmetry .",
    "this dissipational dynamics via quantum particle production exhibits the feature of unstable bands , and an exponential growth of the quantum fluctuating modes that are characteristics of parametric resonance .",
    "the growth of the modes in the unstable bands translates into profuse particle production .",
    "a given unstable mode will grow as long as it lies within the unstable band .",
    "however , eventually it will be red - shifted out of the band as the universe expands , and then the instabilities of parametric resonance are shut off . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that for the pq symmetry breaking scale @xmath3 , because the axion is very weakly coupled , the time it takes to be red - shifted out of the unstable band is too short to build up an appreciable growth of the quantum fluctuating modes .",
    "thus , all of these effects are insignificant .",
    "the condensate is effectively nondissipative and pressureless .",
    "it would survive in the expanding universe , and it behaves like cold dust at the present time . interestingly ,",
    "if @xmath4 , it could constitute a major component of the dark matter of the universe .",
    "recently , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite were motivated by the recent understanding of the important role of the spinodal instability and parametric resonance that provide the nonlinear and nonperturbative mechanisms in the quantum particle production driven by the large amplitude oscillations of the coherent field  @xcite .",
    "they re - examined the issue of the dissipation of the axion field resulting from the production of its quantum fluctuations .",
    "they confirmed that the presence of the parametric resonance would lead to an explosive growth of quantum fluctuations if the universe was minkowskian .",
    "taking account of the expansion of the universe , quantum fluctuations of the axion do not become significant .",
    "this result confirms the conventional wisdom .    in this paper",
    ", we will re - examine the damping dynamics of the axion arising from photon production in an expanding universe in the context of the non - equilibrium quantum field theory . the goal of this study is to present a detailed and systematical study of the above - mentioned problem using a fully non - equilibrium formalism  @xcite .",
    "we will derive the coupled nonperturbative equation for the axion field and the mode equations for the photon field in a flat robertson - walker spacetime within the nonperturbative hartree approximation that is implemented to consistently take the back reaction effects into account .",
    "we then try to study both numerically and analytically how the nonperturbative effects of spinodal instability and parametric amplification of quantum fluctuations trigger photon production from the oscillations of the axion field . at this stage",
    ", it is worthwhile to mention that our approach can be generalized to any pseudo - scalar field coupled to the photon field in a more general curved spacetime . since the pseudo - scalar nature of the coupling between the axion and the photon , the axion field affects the left- and right - handed circularly polarized photons differently .",
    "this leads to producing the two polarized photons in different amounts .",
    "this polarization asymmetry , if it survives , may have interesting effects on the polarization of the cosmic microwave background .    to consider the fermionic plasma effect on photon production ,",
    "one must systematically obtain the non - equilibrium in - medium photon propagators and the off - equilibrium effective vertices between the axion and the photon by integrating out the fermionic field to deal with this problem@xcite . in a plasma , the transverse photons",
    "are dynamically screened @xcite . however , in the literatures  @xcite , the arguments stated to include the fermionic plasma effect in support of their conclusions amount to adding by hand the electron plasma frequency into the propagating photon mode equations .",
    "this is problematic when we consider propagating photon modes in the presence of a thermal background .",
    "in fact , the consequence of the abelian ward identities reveals that the transverse photons have the vanishing static magnetic mass in all orders of the perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this means that the in - medium transverse photon propagators must be nonlocal in nature , and can not be approximated by the local propagator as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite even in the low energy limit @xcite .",
    "besides , in a fermionic plasma , the effective coupling between the axion and the photon resulting from integrating out the fermionic thermal loop can be modified both at finite temperature as well as out of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "therefore , to fully consider the plasma effect , the non - equilibrium in - medium photon propagators as well as the off - equilibrium effective vertices play the essential roles .",
    "however , incorporating these non - equilibrium effects is a challenging task that lies beyond the scope of this paper , but certainly deserves to be taken up in the near future . in the following",
    ", we will totally ignore the fermionic plasma effect in order to focus on understanding whether the particle production due to spinodal instability as well as parametric amplification is effective or not in the cosmological context .    in sec .",
    "[ axi ] , we introduce the axion physics and its coupling to the photon . an effective action of the axion - photon system in the expanding universe is derived .",

    "[ con ] is our conclusions .",
    "the physics of axion and its implication to astrophysics and cosmology can be found in the review articles  @xcite .",
    "the axion does not couple directly to the photon .",
    "however , at tree level , the axion field @xmath5 has a coupling with the fermionic field @xmath6 , @xmath7 therefore , the axion can couple to the photon via a fermionic loop . as a consequence of the color anomaly of the pq current , similar to the pion - photon system , the effective lagrangian density for the axion - photon coupling is @xmath8 where @xmath9 . in eq .",
