    "the dimensionality of the 115 materials , cerhin@xmath1 , ceirin@xmath1 , and cecoin@xmath1 , appears to be related to their superconducting transition temperature .",
    "the material with the highest t@xmath2 , cecoin@xmath0 , has the most 2d - like fermi surface ( fs ) of the three .",
    "@xcite cerhin@xmath0 has a high t@xmath2 ( @xmath32.1 k ) , but only under a pressure of @xmath316 kbar . at ambient pressures ,",
    "cerhin@xmath0 is an anti - ferromagnet .",
    "the fs of cerhin@xmath0 was the subject of one of our recent publications.@xcite in order to confirm the link between the superconducting state and fs dimensionality , the fs as a function of pressure in cerhin@xmath0 should be measured .",
    "if the fs becomes more 2d - like as the critical pressure is approached , then this will be evidence for making a connection .    in these materials",
    "it seems that superconductivity does not appear until the overlap between the _ f _ electron wavefunctions is sufficient to allow band - like behavior .",
    "measurements of the fs as a function of pressure should show this increasing overlap as a change in topography . here",
    "we present measurements up to 7.9 kbar , about half the critical pressure for cerhin@xmath1 .",
    "we have designed and built small pressure cells , capable of running in a dilution refrigerator and in a rotator .",
    "measuring torque inside a pressure cell is impossible , so we have made small compensated pickup coils which fit into the cell .",
    "each coil has four to five thousand turns .",
    "the filling factor approaches unity because we are able to situate the coil along with the sample inside the cell .",
    "a small coil is wound on the exterior of the cell to provide an ac modulation of the applied field .",
    "we have measured the fs of cerhin@xmath0 under several pressures . at each pressure",
    "we measure fs frequencies and their amplitude dependence as a function of temperature . from this",
    "we can extract information about how the effective mass of the quasiparticles is changing as the pressure is increased .",
    "the figures show the fourier spectra of cerhin@xmath0 under @xmath37.9 kbar .",
    "the crystal was oriented so that the a - b axis plane is perpendicular to the applied field .",
    "at @xmath37.9 kbar and at ambient pressures ( measured in the pressure cell prior to pressurization ) reveals little that is suggestive of change . ]",
    "we show the 7.9 kbar data compared with two sets of data taken at ambient pressure . in fig .",
    "[ highfft ] the fs at 7.9 kbar is compared with the ambient data taken with a torque cantilever ( the same data reported in @xcite ) . because the modulation field for the ac measurements ( in the pressure cell ) was so small ,",
    "the lowest frequencies can be ignored .",
    "notice that the 1411 t ( f@xmath4 , the designation given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and 1845 t peaks are reproduced exactly in the ambient and the pressure data sets .",
    "the 1845 t peak was not included in ref .",
    "@xcite because of its small amplitude in ambient pressure torque measurements .",
    "the 3600 t ( f@xmath5 ) and 6120 t ( f@xmath6 ) peaks are present in both data sets ; however , the f@xmath5 appears to have split and the f@xmath6 appears to have shifted down in frequency .",
    "such changes could be explained as slight differences of sample alignment with respect to the applied field between the torque measurement and the pressure cell measurement .",
    "three other frequencies , 2076 t , 2710 t , and 4613 t , emerge in the pressure data which are close to to some reported in ref .",
    "@xcite to be observed only at the lowest temperatures ( 25 mk ) .",
    "all but the first of these frequencies are seen also in ambient pressure data taken with the sample in the pressure cell prior to pressurization as shown in fig .",
    "[ lowfft ] .",
    "thus , assuming the differences in frequency between the torque measurements and pressure cell measurements are due to differences in alignment , we can make frequency assignments that follow ref .",
    "@xcite ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ lowfft ] ) .",
    "the relative increase in amplitude with increasing pressure of these three peaks could be a result of the increase of the coupling factor between the sample and the coil as the two are compressed together .",
    "the lack of any clear differences in the fs up to 7.9 kbar suggests that if the fs changes , then such change is not a linear function of pressure . nor is there a compelling reason to think that it should be a linear function .",
    "possibly , at some pressure closer the the critical pressure , the transition to _ f _ electron itinerate behavior will take place leading to more noticable changes in the fs .",
    "the fs of cerhin@xmath1 appears to remain topographically stable under the application of pressure up to 7.9 kbar .",
    "additional measurements which approach the critical pressure ( @xmath316 kbar ) are of prime importance .",
    "this work was performed at the national high magnetic field laboratory , which is supported by nsf cooperative agreement no .",
