    "a wide variety of particle physics models predict the existence of a multiverse , where bubbles of different vacua nucleate and expand in an eternally inflating background .",
    "occasionally bubbles collide , and observers inside the bubbles can search for the imprints left by these collisions on the cosmic background radiation ( cmb ) . detecting such imprints would be tremendously important , as they would provide a direct evidence for the existence of a multiverse .",
    "the dynamics of these collisions have been studied analytically as well as numerically over the years  @xcite and the analysis of their observational signatures has now become an active area of research ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall discuss another potentially observable manifestation of a multiverse .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that topological defects , like spherical domain walls and circular loops of cosmic string can be spontaneously produced in a de sitter - like universe .",
    "the initial radii of walls and strings are close to the de sitter horizon .",
    "once they are formed , they are stretched by the inflationary expansion , resulting in a scale - invariant size distribution of walls and/or strings .",
    "if indeed we live in an expanding bubble , our bubble will collide with topological defects nucleating in the inflating parent vacuum .",
    "any such collisions that occurred within our past light cone can give rise to potentially observable effects .",
    "the physical properties of the defects depend on the embedding vacuum and may change significantly as the defects cross from the parent vacuum to the bubble interior .",
    "in fact , matching defect solutions may not even exist inside the bubble . collisions of defects with our bubble would then result in the disintegration of the defects .",
    "the opposite limit is when the fields making up the defects do not interact with the field of the bubble , except gravitationally .",
    "then the defects crossing from parent vacuum into the bubble will only respond to the change of spacetime geometry .",
    "walls and strings encountered by our bubble will then remain , at least partially , in the bubble interior and may be observable directly .",
    "these defects , originating in the false vacuum , can in principle be much heavier than strings and walls that can be formed in phase transitions inside our bubble .",
    "our goal in this paper is to study the dynamics of the intruding defects and to estimate the number of potentially observable collisions",
    ". we shall focus on cosmic strings , but most of our discussion will apply to domain walls as well . in the next section",
    "we specify our assumptions and approximations and find the conditions for a string loop or a spherical domain wall to collide with the bubble . in section iii , we study the propagation of the defects that do get inside the bubble and find their asymptotic shape .",
    "the spatial distribution of defects is discussed in section iv , and the number of potentially observable collision events is estimated in section v. the distribution of collision regions on the observer s sky is discussed in section vi , although the investigation of the nature of observable effects due to collisions is left for future study .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section vii .",
    "some technical details of the calculations are given in the appendices .",
    "in this section , we shall discuss the conditions for a string loop ( or domain wall ) nucleated outside of our bubble to collide with the bubble . to set up the problem",
    ", we assume the spacetime outside the bubble , which we shall refer to as the false vacuum , to be a de sitter space with a constant expansion rate @xmath0 .",
    "it can be partially covered by flat chart metric ds^2 = dt^2 - h_f^-2 e^2h_ft ( dr^2+r^2 d_2 ^ 2 ) , [ ds ] where @xmath1 .",
    "it will also be convenient to use cartesian coordinates @xmath2 , related to @xmath3 by dr^2+r^2 d_2 ^ 2 = dx^2+dy^2+dz^2 .",
    "the spacetime inside the bubble has the geometry of an open flrw universe , ds^2 = d^2 - a^2 ( ) ( d^2+^2d_2 ^ 2 )",
    ". we shall refer to it as true vacuum and approximate it by a de sitter space with an expansion rate @xmath4 , a()= h_t^-1 ( h_t ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 has the meaning of the slow - roll inflation rate inside the bubble at the early stages of its evolution . at later times",
    ", the form of @xmath6 should be different , corresponding to radiation and matter eras .",
    "however , we shall see that the shape of strings gets frozen in comoving coordinates soon after they enter the bubble , so the late - time behavior of @xmath6 is unimportant for our consideration .",
    "we shall disregard the gravitational effects of both the bubble wall and the defect .",
    "furthermore , we shall assume that the bubble wall thickness and its initial radius at nucleation are both small compared to the de sitter horizon @xmath7 .",
    "then the worldsheet of the wall is well approximated by the forward light cone , r=1-e^-h_f t , [ wallworldsheet ] where we have chosen the nucleation center to be at the the origin of the flat slicing coordinates given by eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) , namely , @xmath8 .",
    "the nucleation rate of strings and walls is e^-s_e , [ gamma ] where @xmath9 is the euclidean action of the corresponding instanton . in the case of strings , the euclidean worldsheet in the thin wall limit has the form of a maximal 2-sphere of radius @xmath7 embedded in a 4-sphere of the same radius , and the instanton action is s_e = 4h_f^-2 , [ se ] where @xmath10 is the string tension .",
    "the string worldsheet after nucleation is obtained as an analytic continuation of this instanton . for a loop centered at @xmath11 on the @xmath12-axis ,",

    "the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the loop is formed at the time @xmath23 such that the classical action , evaluated from @xmath19 to @xmath23 , is @xmath24 .",

    "the semiclassical description of string nucleation requires that @xmath25 . on the other hand",
    ", we shall be interested in the situation when @xmath9 is not too large , so that the nucleation rate is not too strongly suppressed .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ tf ] ) suggests that @xmath23 is a few hubble times earlier than @xmath13 .",
    "another issue related to the worldsheet cutoff at some time @xmath23 is that such a cutoff selects a reference frame where the loop nucleates .",
    "analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that this frame is determined , at least in part , by the initial conditions at the onset of inflation .",
    "the existence of a preferred frame breaks the de sitter invariance of the false vacuum .",
    "this memory of the initial state extends indefinitely into the future ; it is a manifestation of the so - called persistence of memory effect @xcite .",
    "we shall assume that the coordinate system in ( [ ds ] ) is chosen so that the loops nucleate on constant-@xmath18 surfaces .    the number of string loops of radius @xmath26 , whose centers are located in a 3-volume element @xmath27 on any constant - time surface , is given by @xcite [ dn ] dn = dv , where we have defined @xmath28 and we assumed a lower cutoff at @xmath29 .",

    "true vacuum bubbles may interfere with defect nucleation . as we mentioned in the introduction",
    ", defect solutions may not even exist inside the bubbles . here",
    "we shall assume that defects can not be formed if they overlap with any bubbles at the time of their formation .",
    "the defect radius at the time of formation is @xmath32 , and the nucleation process can be pictured as quantum tunneling from @xmath33 to @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "we shall assume that defects can be formed only if they do not encounter any bubbles in the course of the tunneling  that is , if there are no bubbles in the defect interior at @xmath35 .",
    "on the other hand , once a defect is formed , true vacuum bubbles can nucleate in its interior .",
    "nucleating loops of string will have random orientations , with the angle @xmath14 in ( [ stringworldsheet ] ) ranging from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",

    "the corresponding loops will therefore only partially enter the bubble .",
    "string loops with nucleation centers in the blue area of the diagram hit the bubble from the right , while loops with nucleation centers in the red and green areas hit it from the left .",
    "in the latter case , the loop must encircle the bubble ; hence , it has to be formed at @xmath57 , prior to bubble nucleation .",
    "we emphasize that loops can form in the false vacuum even when their nucleation centers are in the true vacuum inside the bubble .",
    "for example , the loop nucleation center can be in the red area of the diagram , while the loop formation time , which is earlier than @xmath13 , can be at @xmath60 ( that is , @xmath61 ) . the loop is then formed prior to the bubble nucleation .",
    "when the bubble forms , it is initially encircled by the loop , and as it expands , the loop is eventually completely engulfed by the bubble .",
