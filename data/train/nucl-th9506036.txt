    "quantum monte carlo methods , adopted for nuclei in the last decade , have proven to be very useful in obtaining exact solutions of the nuclear schrdinger equation for the ground and low - energy excited states of up to six nucleons  @xcite , and it is likely that many states of seven and eight nucleons will be exactly calculated with realistic nuclear forces in the near future . a variational approximation , @xmath3 , to the lowest - energy state of the desired spin , parity , and isospin , @xmath4 , is first obtained by a variational monte carlo ( vmc ) calculation  @xcite . the exact eigenstate , @xmath5 , belonging to the lowest - energy eigenvalue , @xmath6 , for that @xmath4 is then projected out using @xmath7 |\\psi_v\\rangle\\ ] ] with the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method  @xcite .",

    "this difference , reflecting the deficiencies in @xmath3 , could be because the two - body functions @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are not optimally determined by the approximate equations used to construct them , or the true @xmath5 contains many - body correlations in addition to @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "the total isospin of the system is @xmath69 , its projection is @xmath73 , and @xmath66 can have the values @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",

    "it is further reduced to 0.00035 by the inclusion of @xmath175 . the subsequent reduction to @xmath92 = 0.00028",
    "is due to @xmath176 . the @xmath177 correlations and the changes in the @xmath56 correlations have very small ( @xmath178 ) effect on the total @xmath92 .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the final values of the parameters of the new three - body correlations were determined by minimizing the energy . in table iii , we present the results for the binding energy of @xmath0h , for the faddeev wave function and various variational wave functions moving from the old to the new .",
    "a set of 50,000 configurations sampled from @xmath179 was used for these calculations .",
    "the first column contains the values of the binding energy and the second the difference @xmath180 .",
    "we can clearly see that this difference is reduced approximately by a factor of two , when one goes from the old to the new @xmath144 , and that the @xmath116 and @xmath175 give almost 80% of the improvement .",

    "the mean energy of these excited states is given by : @xmath185 for both old and new @xmath144 .",

    "these new correlations , obtained by comparing the @xmath108 and @xmath144 for the argonne @xmath133 and urbana viii hamiltonian , seem to have more general applicability . results of variational calculations for @xmath0h and @xmath2he , with different interaction models , using either the old @xmath144 ( ref . [ 2 ] ) or the new @xmath144 with the same three - body correlation parameters given in table i are listed in tables iv and v. ( the difference between the old argonne @xmath133 and urbana viii value given in table iv and the old @xmath56 given in table iii is of marginal statistical significance ; it can be attributed to slight changes to the the @xmath21 in the present work compared to ref . [ 2 ] , and the different random walks followed in the two calculations . ) a significant improvement is seen in each case , with @xmath192 3050% of the energy difference with exact calculations , where available , recovered . in principle , the parameters of the new correlations should be optimized separately for each case , but this has not been done in the present work .",
    "the faddeev energies shown in table iv have been calculated from the los alamos - iowa @xmath108 using monte carlo integration , and thus have a quoted statistical error .",
    "these energies are consistent with those published by the los alamos - iowa group  @xcite . for @xmath2he ,",
    "the current vmc results are fairly competitive with other recently developed methods , faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy )  @xcite and correlated hyperspherical harmonics ( chh )  @xcite , as shown in table v. however , all these methods fall short of the exact gfmc calculations  @xcite in @xmath2he .    if the wave function @xmath193 were an exact eigenstate of h , then it should satisfy the eigenvalue equation : @xmath194 and this equation should be satisfied for any space configuration , meaning that any local energy @xmath195 should be equal to the eigenvalue @xmath196 . for the three - body system we considered sets of different space configurations , each set being composed of configurations having the same @xmath146 ( the perimeter of the triangle formed by the three particles ) , and computed the average of the energies returned by eq.([eq : eigenrr ] ) .",
    "these average values , @xmath197 , are then a function of @xmath146 and can be plotted against it . in figs .  3 , 4 , and 5 we show the results respectively for the faddeev wave function , and the old and new variational wave function .",
    "these calculations were done with the argonne @xmath133 two - body and urbana model viii three - body interactions .    from fig .",
    "3 we can clearly see that , even for the faddeev wave function , there are regions , in particular for small and large perimeters , where the average values differ from the energy expectation value .",
    "moreover , the variance is finite at all @xmath146 , whereas it would be zero for an exact eigenfunction .",
    "the deviations of @xmath198 and the variance of the faddeev local energy are perhaps due to the errors introduced by numerical interpolation and the application of the permutation operators , required to go from the faddeev amplitude to the full wave function , as explained in the previous section .",
    "the application of these permutation operators in the los alamos - iowa faddeev solution is implemented by means of partial wave series truncated at 34 channels .",
    "this problem led us to consider , in the procedure to search for the three - body correlations , only those regions in configuration space where the faddeev wave function gives an @xmath199 close to the exact energy . a comparison of the old and new variational wave function results ( fig .  4 to fig .",
    "5 ) shows that the new correlations clearly tend to push the average values in the right direction and to reduce the variance .    in variational calculations of six - body nuclei",
    "@xcite the new three - body correlations continue to lower the variational upper bound .",
    "one simple generalization that can be made is to let the @xmath62 correlation have different strengths depending on whether none , one , or two of the nucleons @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are in the p - shell . at present",
    "it appears best to let this correlation be zero if one or two are in the p - shell , although an alternate structure might be even better in these cases .",
    "it is also beneficial to reduce the overall strength of the @xmath175 and @xmath176 correlations . with these steps , the new three - body correlations lower the energy by @xmath192 0.25 mev in @xmath200li , and also reduce the variance .    in conclusion",
    "we have reported significant progress in the construction of accurate variational wave functions for the nuclear few - body problem .",
    "we believe that the new three - body correlations will lead to clear improvement in gfmc wave functions for light nuclei , as well as in variational wave functions of heavier systems .",
