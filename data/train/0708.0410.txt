    "some of the key features in the dynamics of open quantum systems @xcite are phenomena such as relaxation , decoherence and the buildup of correlations and entanglement due to the interaction of the open system with its environment .",
    "this behavior is generic in the sense that it is observable for many different kinds of environments and microscopic interactions . for many physical systems",
    "it is justified to assume that the coupling to the environment is weak ( born approximation ) or that correlations in the bath decay quickly with respect to the typical timescale of the system s dynamics ( markov approximation ) . in this case",
    "it is often possible to construct a generator for the dynamics which is in lindblad form @xcite .    in general ,",
    "however , memory effects in the bath can not be neglected and the markov assumption is not applicable any more .",
    "such systems are said to exhibit non - markovian behavior .",
    "this can be due to strong system - environment couplings @xcite , correlations and entanglement in the initial state @xcite , finite reservoirs @xcite , or due to coupling to environments at low temperatures or to spin baths @xcite .",
    "also , heat transport in nano - structures @xcite has been shown to exhibit non - markovian behavior .",
    "a powerful tool for dealing with such systems is provided by the projection operator techniques @xcite which have been introduced by nakajima @xcite , zwanzig @xcite and mori @xcite .",
    "these techniques are based on the introduction of a projection superoperator @xmath0 which acts on the density operator @xmath1 of the total system and projects onto the so - called relevant part @xmath2 .",
    "the latter represents a certain approximation of @xmath1 , and this procedure leads to a simplified effective description of the dynamics through a reduced set of relevant variables",
    ". stated differently , the projection @xmath0 expresses the elimination of certain degrees of freedom which are considered negligible for the treatment of the open system s dynamics .    here , we will consider two different approaches which both lead to a closed equation for the dynamics of the relevant part of @xmath1 .",
    "the first one leads to the nakajima - zwanzig equation @xcite , an integrodifferential master equation for @xmath2 containing a memory kernel .",
    "the second approach eliminates the integration over the system s history and leads to the time - convolutionless master equation which is local in time , but involves a time - dependent generator @xcite . in both cases",
    "the resulting master equation is used as a starting point for a systematic expansion in powers of the system - environment interaction .",
    "usually the projector is chosen such that @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is some fixed environmental state , e.g.  a thermal equilibrium state , and where @xmath5 denotes the partial trace over the environment .",
    "the superoperator @xmath0 projects the total state @xmath1 onto a tensor - product state , i.e. , onto a state without any statistical correlations between the open system and its environment . if correlations remain small , this ansatz is justified and the perturbation expansion is usually carried out only to leading order in the perturbation ( born approximation ) . however , for many physical systems exhibiting strong correlations , the born approximation might be inadequate such that one also has to take into account higher orders of the expansion .",
    "the calculation of higher orders is limited by the increase of mathematical complexity , though , and furthermore , the expansion may not converge uniformly in time , such that higher orders may diverge on longer timescales @xcite .",
    "a different strategy for taking strong correlations into account is to introduce a superoperator @xmath0 that projects onto a correlated system - environment state , i.e. , onto a state that contains certain statistical correlations between the open system and its environment @xcite .",
    "we will refer to such @xmath0 as a correlated projection superoperator . in the present article",
    "we will discuss in detail the application of the correlated projection operator method to a two level system interacting with a spin bath .",
    "this system is particularly interesting since it models the hyperfine interaction of an electron confined to a quantum dot with its surrounding nuclei @xcite .",

    "one can formulate a simple set of rules that enable one to write down immediately these expressions and the corresponding expressions for all higher orders @xcite .",
    "the tcl technique has been applied to many physical systems .",

    "applications of the tcl method to systems relevant for quantum information processing may be found in @xcite .",
    "recently , the performance of the tcl approach has been studied for the model of a qubit coupled to a spin bath via ising interaction @xcite , and for a general open system coupled to a bath through pure phase noise @xcite .",
    "we emphasize at this point that the tcl master equation describes non - markovian dynamics although it is local in time .",
    "all memory effects are taken into account by the explicit time - dependence of the tcl generator .",
    "it should also be pointed out that both the nz equation ( [ nz - gen ] ) and the tcl equation ( [ tcl - gen ] ) are exact in the sense that they are equivalent to the equation of motion gained from the full system hamiltonian .",
    "it is important to realize that the nz and the tcl techniques lead to equations of motion with entirely different structures .",
    "therefore , also the mathematical structure of their solutions are quite different in any given order @xcite .",

    "a further remarkable feature of the projection ( [ projection - jm ] ) is that the corresponding nz equation of second order ( [ master - cps2 ] ) reproduces the _ exact _ dynamics of the populations .",
    "this can be demonstrated by solving the equations for the populations obtained from the master equation ( [ master - cps2 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , we can prove this statement directly with the help of the following argument .",
    "we first note that by use of eq .",
    "( [ plp - assum ] ) the von neumann equation ( [ neumann - eq ] ) leads to the exact equation @xmath161 from which we obtain an exact equation for the populations of the central spin : @xmath162 the crucial point is that for arbitrary @xmath163 the following relation holds , @xmath164 hence , when calculating the diagonal elements of the density matrix we may insert at any time a factor of @xmath39 in front of the density matrix @xmath163 .",
    "this fact is obviously related to the invariance of the subspaces spanned by the states @xmath88 and @xmath89 , a fact that has already been used to solve the schrdinger equation . for a formal proof one uses the expression ( [ projection - jm ] ) to demonstrate that eq .",
    "( [ pop - rel ] ) is a direct consequence of the relation @xmath165 with certain system operators @xmath166 .",
    "using now the relation ( [ pop - rel ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ pop - exact ] ) we find @xmath167 this equation is exact and coincides with the equation for the population that is obtained from the second - order nz equation ( [ nz2 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the nz equation of second order indeed yields the exact dynamics of the populations .",
    "we have investigated the performance of the correlated projection operator method in the case of a spin - bath model where a central spin couples to a spin bath via full heisenberg interaction .",
    "the coupling constants have been chosen to be uniform such that one can construct an exact solution of the von neumann equation .",
    "we have considered two different projection superoperators , one of which projects onto the eigenspaces of the @xmath168-component @xmath77 of the total bath angular momentum .",
    "the other projection operator projects onto the simultaneous eigenspaces of @xmath77 and the square @xmath80 of the total bath angular momentum .",
    "the choice of these projections is motivated by the fact that both @xmath112 and @xmath80 are conserved under the dynamics given by the full system hamiltonian .",
    "the projection superoperators studied here thus fully exploit the known symmetries of the model , granting the invariance of the expectation values of the conserved quantities . for both projectors",
    "we have solved the nakajima - zwanzig and the time - convolutionless master equation to second order in the interaction and have compared the results to the exact solution .",
    "both the nz and the tcl master equation lead to a relaxation and decoherence behavior that approximates the exact solution very well . remarkably , also the position and the width of the partial revivals of the coherence and the populations could be reproduced .",
    "for all tested parameter sets , the tcl and nz solutions were hardly distinguishable . in these cases",
    "the tcl approach is to be favored because of its much simpler structure .",
    "a remarkable property of the projection superoperator that projects onto the simultaneous eigenspaces of @xmath80 and @xmath77 is that the corresponding second - order nz equation results in the exact dynamics for the populations .",
    "while the standard product state projection gives only a poor approximation , the above correlated projection reproduces the exact solution already in lowest order .",
    "this illustrates an important feature of the correlated projection operator method .",
    "namely , different choices for the projection @xmath39 yield dynamic equations of different structure for different sets of relevant variables .",
    "therefore , the resulting expressions for the quantities of interest , e.g.  the populations , may differ in all orders of the coupling . hence",
    ", changing the projection operator corresponds in general to a non - perturbative reorganization of the expansion for the desired quantities .    finally , we emphasize that all calculations in this paper involving projection operator techniques can be carried out in a similar way for more realistic assumptions regarding the coupling constants",
    ". the correlated projection operator technique may thus be applicable to many physically relevant problems featuring non - markovian dynamics , such as the hyperfine interaction of an electron confined to a quantum dot , the spin dynamics under a spin - echo pulse sequence , or the spin dynamics in a molecular magnet ."
