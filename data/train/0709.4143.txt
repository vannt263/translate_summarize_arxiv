    "<S> this paper presents an evolution model of weighted networks in which the structural growth and weight dynamics are driven by human behavior , i.e. passenger route choice behavior . </S>",
    "<S> transportation networks grow due to people s increasing travel demand and the pattern of growth is determined by their route choice behavior . in airline networks </S>",
    "<S> passengers often transfer from a third airport instead of flying directly to the destination , which contributes to the hubs formation and finally the scale - free statistical property . in this model </S>",
    "<S> we assume at each time step there emerges a new node with @xmath0 travel destinations . </S>",
    "<S> then the new node either connects destination directly with the probability @xmath1 or transfers from a third node with the probability @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical result shows degree and strength both obey power - law distribution with the exponent between 2.33 and 3 depending on @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the weights also obey power - law distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the clustering coefficient , degree assortatively coefficient and degree - strength correlation are all dependent on the probability @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this model can also be used in social networks .    </S>",
    "<S> most networks in real world are weighted . </S>",
    "<S> recently weighted networks dynamics have attracted much attention . </S>",
    "<S> people have developed many new models to understand weighted networks evolution mechanism based on the barabsi - albert ( ba ) model @xcite which first proposed preferential attachment for networks evolution . </S>",
    "<S> antal - krapivsky ( ak ) model @xcite relaxes degree preferential attachment to weight driven attachment mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> barrat - barthlmy - vespignani ( bbv ) model @xcite adds local weight reinforcement dynamics to the structure growth and weight - driven mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> dorogovtsev - mendes ( dm ) model gets similar result with bbv model . w. </S>",
    "<S> wang et al@xcite gives a global weight reinforcement mechanism to structure growth and weight driven attachment to model traffic networks evolution . </S>",
    "<S> guimera and amaral @xcite models world - wide airport networks including spatial information as weight . </S>",
    "<S> researchers begin to put more focus on weight dynamics and weight interaction with other factors @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the above papers all assume the weight changes automatically at each step due to weight and topology coupling mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> however this assumption is too rough to understand underlying driving factors and helps little to control and manipulate networks . </S>",
    "<S> transportation networks are good examples to explain this argument . </S>",
    "<S> traffic is composed by passengers who are decision makers . </S>",
    "<S> they decide which routes to choose and then changes the traffic on routes . </S>",
    "<S> the shortest path finding behavior and congestion phenomenon in networks have been studied by many papers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> passengers collective route selection behavior play a critical role in the hubs formation and the pattern of network growth . for example , in airline industry airline companies provide low price for those who are willing to take transfer flights . </S>",
    "<S> passengers make their decisions based on own time and money consideration . </S>",
    "<S> some sensitive to price select transfer flights and contribute to traffic in hubs . </S>",
    "<S> if all passengers are not sensitive and do nt want to transfer , the hubs and thus the popular hub - and - spoke operation model in airline industry since 1970 s can not come into being . and </S>",
    "<S> the world - wide airline networks would not display the structure nowadays . </S>",
    "<S> so here we propose a new approach to understand transportation network evolution taking passenger s route selection behavior into consideration in addition to weight and topology coupling mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> the model assumes at each stage there emerges a new node with @xmath0 destinations , i.e. new travel demand is created . </S>",
    "<S> a passenger who wants to go from origin to destination select his route . </S>",
    "<S> he can either fly directly to the destination or transfer at a third place . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of taking non - stop flight is @xmath1 and that of transfer flight is @xmath2 . in the transfer case </S>",
    "<S> , the passenger determines transfer node based on the weight between transfer node and destination . </S>",
    "<S> analytical results show degree and strength both obey power - law distribution with the exponent between @xmath3 and @xmath4 depending on @xmath1 . the weights also obey power - law distribution . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath5 , the model recover the strength - driven ak model . </S>",
    "<S> if we let @xmath6 , it reproduces the results of the bbv model . </S>",
    "<S> simulation confirms the theoretical results . </S>",
    "<S> this model is not limited in explaining transportation networks . </S>",
    "<S> it can also used to explain social networks which we will discuss later .    </S>",
    "<S> the detailed model is described as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the initial network has @xmath7 nodes with existing links . </S>",
    "<S> there are initial weights @xmath8 on the links . </S>",
    "<S> the networks evolutes according to the following rules :    * _ growth_. in each step a new node @xmath9 emerges with @xmath0 destinations . the probability of one old node @xmath10 to be the destination </S>",
    "<S> is determined by the ratio of its strength @xmath11 to the total strength of all nodes : + @xmath12 + which suggests that nodes with large strength have large possibility to be travel destinations . * </S>",
    "<S> _ passenger s route choice_. then the new node @xmath9 either connects node @xmath10 with probability @xmath1 or transfers at a third node @xmath13 with probability @xmath2 . in the former case , </S>",
    "<S> a new edge with initial weight @xmath8 between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is established . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> things are little complicated . </S>",
    "<S> passengers have to determine which node to choose as the transfer node . </S>",
    "<S> they only consider destination s neighbors which already have links with the destination . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of node @xmath14 being chosen as the transfer node is : + @xmath15 + here @xmath16 is the neighbors set of node @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 is the weight on edge between vertex @xmath10 and @xmath13 representing the traffic . </S>",
    "<S> once node @xmath13 is chosen , a new edge with initial weight @xmath8 between vertex @xmath9 and @xmath13 is created , and traffic between vertex @xmath10 and @xmath13 increases by @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath8 set the scale of weight . </S>",
    "<S> we can set @xmath18 without impact to the model .    with the above two rules , the network grows and stops when nodes reach a preset large number @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> the rules has practical implications . in the first rule , </S>",
    "<S> a great number of traffic throughput indicate the city is more developed and more attractive to people than those city having little traffic . </S>",
    "<S> this rule is identical to those strength - driven models . in the second rule , there are two approaches to get to the destination . </S>",
    "<S> if passengers choose transfer mode , they prefer those nodes having frequent flights and large traffic between the destination and transfer node because frequent and large traffic can bring convenience , low price and less waiting time .    </S>",
    "<S> ( 60,30 ) ( 0,0)(0,10)(0,22 ) ( 0,22)(9.525,16.5)(19.05,11 ) ( 0,0)(9.525,5.5)(19.05,11)(0,0 ) ( 0,22 ) ( 59.05,11 ) ( 40,0)(0,1)22 ( 40,0)(49.525,5.5)(59.05,11 ) ( 40,22)(49.525,16.5)(59.05,11 ) ( 40,0 ) ( 40,22 ) ( 19.05,11 ) ( 21,11)@xmath13 ( 61,11)@xmath13 ( 0,24)@xmath9 ( 40,24)@xmath9 ( 0,-4)@xmath10 ( 40,-4)@xmath10 ( 30,-10 ) ( -10,-10 )    this model is also applicable to social networks . for example , in author networks a new researcher is attracted to some famous scientist , but he has no approach to know him directly . </S>",
    "<S> instead he finds that it s better to know the scientist s acquaintance with plenty of connections or cooperations between them . with the introduction of that acquaintance , he can finally get to know the scientist . </S>",
    "<S> this will also happen in friends networks , actor networks , etc .    to analyze the distribution of degree and strength </S>",
    "<S> , we notice the model time is measured by the number of nodes added to the network , i.e. , @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> and the natural time scale of the model dynamics is the network size @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we treat strength @xmath21 , degree @xmath22 , time @xmath23 as continuous variables @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when a new node @xmath9 is added into the network , the strength @xmath11 of an already present vertex @xmath10 can increase by 1 if it is selected as a destination or increase by 2 if it is selected as a transfer node . and </S>",
    "<S> the degree @xmath24 of the vertex @xmath10 will only increase by @xmath25 whether it is chosen as destination or transfer node . </S>",
    "<S> we have the following equations :    @xmath26    @xmath27    . </S>",
    "<S> data are consistent with a power - law behavior @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the data are averaged by 20 networks of size @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in the inset , we give the value of @xmath31 obtained by data fitting together with the analytical expression @xmath32 . right : correlations between strength and degree . </S>",
    "<S> the slopes are all around @xmath25 indicating linear relationship . [ strength ] ]    the equation ( [ strengthequation ] ) can be rewritten if we notice the sum of strength at large time @xmath23 is @xmath33 and the initial condition @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> so we obtain : @xmath35    @xmath36    the strength and degree of vertices are thus related by a linear equation . </S>",
    "<S> it means the model is not only strength - driven but also degree - driven .    from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f2 ] ) we get the power - law distribution of the degree and strength @xmath37 with the exponent : @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously @xmath31 is between 2.33 and 3 when @xmath1 ranges from @xmath39 to @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath5 , passenger always choose connect directly , or in other words there are no transfer behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the model is reduced to strength - driven ak model . </S>",
    "<S> if we set @xmath6 , the exponent becomes @xmath40 which reproduces the networks generated by the bbv model . </S>",
    "<S> it worths noticing because it indicates that a model based on human behavior can lead to networks produced by automatic topology and weight coupling . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 in bbv model represents the weight increase in every time period while @xmath2 represents the transfer behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the above finding indicates that transfer behavior can induce weight dynamics in bbv model .    . </S>",
    "<S> data are consistent with a power - law behavior @xmath42 . in the inset , </S>",
    "<S> we give the value of @xmath31 obtained by data fitting together with the analytical expression @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> right : probability distribution @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> data are consistent with a power - law behavior @xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> . we do nt plot the curve for @xmath5 because in that case all weights are 1 and the distribution can not be displayed with an infinite exponent . </S>",
    "<S> the data are averaged by 20 networks of size @xmath29 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> [ degree ] ]    the time evolution of the weights @xmath17 can also be computed analytically . </S>",
    "<S> weight @xmath17 between already present node @xmath10 and @xmath13 evolves each time either @xmath13 or @xmath10 are selected as transfer node to another one . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution equation can be written as :    @xmath45    noticing the initial condition @xmath46 and @xmath33 , we get    @xmath47    thus the weights also have power - law distribution : @xmath48 with the parameter @xmath49 . when @xmath50 , @xmath51 . when the @xmath52 , @xmath53 . actually when @xmath5 there are no transfer behavior and no weight dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> all weights are 1 . </S>",
    "<S> so the probability distribution has an infinite parameter .    in order to check the analytical predictions we performed numerical simulations of networks generated by using the present model with different probability @xmath1 and network size @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation recovers the analytical results . </S>",
    "<S> the probability distribution of strength , degree and weight are in good agreement with theoretical predictions . and </S>",
    "<S> the strength and degree have linear correlations . </S>",
    "<S> when we fit the data , we use the maximum likelihood method to estimate the parameter @xmath31 @xcite . see fig ( [ strength ] ) and fig ( [ degree ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next we investigate the structural organization of the networks generated by our model by studying correlations of vertices . using the formula defined by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) and eq . ( 6 ) of ref @xcite , we calculate degree - dependent cluster coefficient @xmath54 and average nearest - neighbor degree @xmath55 ( also called degree - degree correlations ) . </S>",
    "<S> they both show disassortative behavior with @xmath54 and @xmath55 decreasing with @xmath56 , which indicates there are hierarchal structures in the networks . </S>",
    "<S> the properties are depending on the parameter @xmath1 . for large @xmath1 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> are quite flat . while the @xmath1 decreases , the curves grows .     </S>",
    "<S> depending on the parameter @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> bottom : average nearest - neighbor degree @xmath55 depending on the parameter @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the data are averaged by 20 networks of size @xmath29 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> [ clust_coeff ] ]    this disassortative behavior can be understood in the dynamical growth process . </S>",
    "<S> vertices with large connectivities and strengths are the ones that enter the system early . </S>",
    "<S> new vertices are attracted to preexisting vertices with large strengths . in direct connection mode </S>",
    "<S> , there builds up a disassortative relation between `` old '' vertex with high strength and connectivities and `` young '' vertices with small connectivities . in transfer mode </S>",
    "<S> , the transfer vertices also have high connections because it generally is the most weighted in the neighbor of the destination . </S>",
    "<S> so there also builds up a disassortative relation between transfer vertices and the new vertices </S>",
    "<S> . the average nearest - neighbor degree will be higher than that in direct connection because the transfer mode produces more highly connected vertices than the direct connection mode . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster coefficient in transfer mode is larger than that in direct connection mode because transfer mode connects three vertices in one time period thus produces more correlations between vertices . with small @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> there are more transfer behavior in the networks leading to large @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a model for weighted networks evolution that considers human behavior in addition to weight dynamics and topology growth . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the evolution of degree , strength and weight . </S>",
    "<S> they are all distributed according to power laws with exponents dependent on the probability @xmath1 which determines the behavior of passengers . </S>",
    "<S> clustering and correlations between vertices show clear disassortative behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the most difference between our model and previous models is that human behavior is incorporated to induce weight dynamics instead of automatic weight dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this reveals the underlying driving force in the growth of transportation networks and social networks . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the model might provide a starting point for the realistic modeling that incorporates human behavior into technological networks modeling . </S>"
