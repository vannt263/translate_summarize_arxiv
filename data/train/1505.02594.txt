    "baryon number of the universe is generated from lepton asymmetry through sphaleron effect , i.e. leptogenesis .",

    "in fact , these q - balls can be formed when we consider the affleck - dine baryogenesis with @xmath6 flat direction , for instance . in this case , it is possible that its lepton component can decay into leptons while its baryon component can not decay into baryons .",
    "this implies that the difference between the baryonic component and the leptonic component in decay rate may induce an electric charge .",
    "therefore , through the decay of the leptonic components only , an electric charge is induced even if the neutral q - ball was formed at the beginning .",
    "the electric charge is expected to make differences in the experimental signatures of the relic q - balls .",
    "for instance , the neutral q - balls can be detected by super - kamiokande  @xcite , which probes the absorption of protons , but this detector is not suited for detection of the charged q - balls since the charged q - balls can not absorb the protons due to the electrical repulsion .",
    "the charged q - balls are likely to behave as some kind of nuclei , and are known to be detectable by such detectors as macro  @xcite and the observational bounds on mass and flux of the relic charged q - balls are obtained  @xcite .",
    "in fact , electrically charged q - ball has been studied in the literature and is called gauged q - ball  @xcite .",

    "there is a previous work which also discussed the evolution of q - balls in two scalar model  @xcite , in which the gauge field was neglected .",
    "however , in the course of decay , it is expected that an electrical repulsion arises , so that the gauge field must be taken into account .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a simplified model where there are two complex scalar fields and u(1 ) gauge field .",
    "one of the complex fields carries baryon charge and positive electric charge , while the other one carries lepton charge and negative electric charge . our main purpose is to demonstrate that gauged q - balls may be realized in our universe through the decay process of the lepton component , even if q - balls are initially neutral .",

    "[ fig:1sdedq1 ] .",
    "since our main interest is in the evolution of global q - balls formed from the flat direction which is responsible for the affleck - dine mechanism , we must consider the case of several numbers of scalar fields coupled with a gauge field .",
    "here we consider the simplest case in which the flat direction consists of two scalar fields which carry baryon and lepton numbers respectively , and the gauge field is abelian .",

    "therefore , it is expected that through decay process , the initially formed neutral q - ball may evolve into the charged or gauged q - ball , which means that the charged q - balls may emerge in our universe . next , if we look at the energy , we see that in fig .",
    "[ fig : pptf ] , the energy decreases along the decay , which indicates that the particle which comes out from the q - ball has positive energy .",

    "then the condition that the cloud radius becomes equal to the size of the q - ball is written as@xmath127 this must happen for @xmath128 that is , before the baryonic decay starts to occur , where we have used the analysis parallel to that below eq .",
    "( [ eq : dedbph ] ) .",
    "therefore , the condition that the leptonic decay stops before baryonic decay occurs is given by @xmath129 this implies that if the baryon number is large enough , the leptonic decay may stop before the baryonic decay takes place , so that the charged q - ball may survive as a relic in the universe .",
    "we see that for @xmath130 bohr radius is already smaller than the q - ball size when the cloud is about to be formed , which means that the evolution stops without forming the cloud . thus , more accurately ,",
    "if @xmath131 then the charged q - balls are expected to survive with a cloud surrounding it , and if @xmath132 then the charged q - balls are expected to survive without the cloud , the baryonic decay starts to occur when @xmath133 , and this is larger than @xmath134 , which is when the evolution is expected to stop .",

    "in this paper , we considered gauged q - balls in the two scalar model in order to discuss the evolution of neutral q - balls which are formed from the flat direction in the affleck - dine mechanism and the possibility of realization of gauged q - balls during their evolution .",
    "we approximated the evolution as a sequence of charged q - ball solutions , which is implied from the situation that only the leptonic component decays off .",
    "as a result , a coulomb potential arises and the q - ball becomes electrically charged as expected .",
    "in other words , it is energetically favored for leptonic decay to occur . however , since there is an upper bound on charge of gauged q - ball , the amount of decay is limited as well , which we examined quantitatively .",
    "in addition , if the baryon number of the initially formed q - ball is large enough , the electric charge of the q - ball grows enough so that the particle which is emitted from the q - ball is bound to it . the baryonic decay is also expected to occur by virtue of the electrical repulsion , which leads to the vanishing of the charged q - balls in the universe .",

    "we roughly estimated when this can happen , and as a consequence , we found that there exists a lower bound on the baryon number .",
    "suppose that dark matter consists of q - balls . since a q - ball is known to absorb protons and emit pions , the neutral q - balls can be detected by super - kamiokande  @xcite or icecube  @xcite , while these detectors are not suited for detection of the charged q - balls since charged q - balls can not absorb the protons due to the electrical repulsion .",

    "<S> it is known that after affleck - dine baryogenesis , spatial inhomogeneities of affleck - dine field grow into non - topological solitons called q - balls . in gauge mediated susy breaking models , sufficiently large q - balls with baryon charge are stable while q - balls with lepton charge can always decay into leptons . for a q - ball that carries nonzero @xmath0 and @xmath1 charges , </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the baryonic component and the leptonic component in decay rate may induce nonzero electric charge on the q - ball . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that charged q - ball , also called gauged q - ball , may emerge in our universe . in this paper , we investigate two complex scalar fields , a baryonic scalar field and a leptonic one , in an abelian gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> we find stable solutions of gauged q - balls for different baryon and lepton charges . </S>",
    "<S> those solutions shows that a coulomb potential arises and the q - ball becomes electrically charged as expected . </S>",
    "<S> it is energetically favored that some amount of leptonic component decays , but there is an upper bound on its amount due to the coulomb force . </S>",
    "<S> the baryonic decay also becomes possible by virtue of electrical repulsion and we find the condition to suppress it so that the charged q - balls can survive in the universe .    </S>",
