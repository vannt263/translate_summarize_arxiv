    "bismuth telluride bi@xmath0te@xmath1 is a narrow - band gap semiconductor ( energy gap e@xmath2=0.13 ev @xcite ) which has been extensively studied because of its excellent thermoelectric properties .",
    "recently , it has been discovered that bi@xmath0te@xmath1 as well as bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 belong to a group of materials called three - dimensional strong topological insulators ( ti ) @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , these were predicted to be insulating in the bulk , while their surface hosts topologically protected metallic states that can be described as massless dirac fermions .",
    "these conducting surface states have been first observed using surface - sensitive methods like angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite or scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite .",
    "however , finding unambiguous evidence of the surface states using transport experiments has proven to be difficult .",
    "namely , in most ti samples charge transport is dominated by a high bulk conductivity due to residual carriers arising from self - doping by point defects in the material , which complicates the identification of the surface contribution to the conductivity @xcite .",
    "so far , successful approaches to suppressing the bulk conductivity include chemical doping @xcite , electrical gating @xcite or the increase of the surface - to - volume ratio by fabricating thin films or nanowires @xcite",
    ". however , if any future applications of tis in technology are to be realized , achieving an insulating bulk state in these materials remains a necessary challenge .",
    "here , we investigate electron irradiation - induced defects as a method to reduce the bulk conductivity of the topological insulator bi@xmath0te@xmath1 .",
    "+ bi@xmath0te@xmath1 has a tetradymite crystal structure ( space group @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) ) with a rhombohedral primitive unit cell which contains five atoms in total , two bi atoms on equivalent sites and three te atoms which are distributed on two non - equivalent sites denoted te1 and te2 .",
    "bi@xmath0te@xmath1 has a layered structure and can be described as a stack of so - called _",
    "quintuple layers _ along the trigonal axis , which each contain five atomic layers in a te1-bi - te2-bi - te1 pattern .",
    "the bonding between the te1 layers belonging to two adjacent quintuple layers is of van der waals type , whereas the bonding within the quintuple layers is covalent .",
    "the carrier type in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 depends strongly on the intrinsic point defects present in the material .",
    "it is generally accepted that the most prominent point defects in as - grown bi@xmath0te@xmath1 are the bi@xmath5 , bi@xmath6 and te@xmath7 antisite defects , with bi@xmath5 and bi@xmath6 acting as acceptors , whereas te@xmath7 acts as electron donor @xcite . te vacancies were predicted to act as double donors whereas bi vacancies act as triple acceptors @xcite . however , due to a higher formation energy of vacancies compared to bi and te antisite defects during growth of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 crystals , the doping during growth has been predicted to be almost entirely determined by the antisite defects @xcite .",
    "+ both the top of the highest valence band and the bottom of the lowest conduction band of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 are generally described by a six - valley model with non - parabolic hole and electron pockets , respectively , which are located pairwise in the three mirror planes of the brillouin zone containing the bisectrix and trigonal axis @xcite .",
    "thus , the effective mass tensor and the electric transport properties are expected to be highly anisotropic .",
    "khler determined the inverse effective mass tensor @xmath8 ( @xmath9 : free electron mass ) from shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations applying an ellipsoidal 6-valley model for the valence band edge ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite ) and the conduction band edge ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite ) with axes 1 , 2 and 3 refering to the binary * n * , bisectrix * s * and trigonal axis * c * , respectively .",
    "moreover , from the observation of a second sdh oscillation period for * * b**@xmath18*c * on p - type samples with hole densities higher than 4 x 10@xmath19 @xmath20 , the filling of a second six - valley valence band , located 15 - 20 mev below the highest valence band , has been concluded for this range of hole densities @xcite .",
    "+ previous irradiation studies on bi@xmath0te@xmath1 have been carried out using 7.5 mev protons at room temperature @xcite , or 5 mev electrons at 250 k @xcite .",
    "hall effect measurements on the irradiated samples have shown that it is in fact possible to convert the conduction of initially p - type bi@xmath21te@xmath1 to n - type using irradiation induced defects . from proton irradiations of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 ,",
    "chaudhari and bever estimated the threshold displacement energy @xmath22 for a lattice atom to be in the range of 7.5 - 12.5 ev for te1 atoms and 15 - 25 ev for te2 and bi atoms @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the displacement threshold for te1 atoms is lower than for te2 or bi atoms because of the weaker van der waals bonding between te1 layers compared to the stronger covalent bonding within the quintuple layers .",
    "annealing at 350 k of samples displaying n - type conduction after irradiation was found to restore the initial p - type conduction @xcite .",
    "+ we have irradiated p - type bi@xmath21te@xmath1 single crystals at room temperature with 2.5 mev electrons , and studied the compensation of the acceptor - type defects by monitoring the resistivity of the samples in - situ during irradiation .",
    "changes in carrier density were deduced from ex - situ magnetoresistance measurements in fields up to 14 t , by analyzing the hall effect and sdh oscillations , detected for all irradiation doses in both the p- and n - type regime .",
    "this , together with the excellent agreement of the extracted carrier effective masses and fermi energies with those measured on bi@xmath0te@xmath1 doped by chemical means @xcite , attests to the fact that doping is the main effect of the irradiation , and that charge carrier scattering is secondary .",
    "moreover , the analysis of the sdh effect allows a coherent interpretation of the fermi surface in p- and n - type bi@xmath0te@xmath1 in terms of a six - valley model and zeeman splitting , without the need to invoke the contribution of either a second valence or conduction band or surface carriers .",
    "p - type bi@xmath21te@xmath1 single crystals ( see @xcite for fabrication details ) were cut into bars with lateral dimensions of 1 x 3 mm@xmath23 using a wire saw and then thinned down to a thickness of 10 to 40 @xmath24 m using scotch tape .",
    "gold contact pads were evaporated on freshly cleaved surfaces , and contacted using silver paint and au wires .",
    "all samples were irradiated at room temperature with 2.5 mev electrons at the _ sirius _ pelletron accelerator facility of the _ laboratoire des solides irradis_. the four - probe resistance of the samples was measured in - situ during irradiation using an ac - technique . after irradiation",
    "the samples were stored in liquid nitrogen to prevent any long - term annealing .",
    "they were then measured ex - situ between 1.9 and 300 k using a quantum design 14 t physical properties measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "all measurements were performed with the magnetic field oriented along * c*. prior to irradiation , all samples showed a similar temperature and field dependence of resistivity and hall coefficient , differences in the absolute values being do to the uncertainty in the determination of the contact distances . in order to compare all samples , their initial resistivity has been normalized to the average resistivity of all unirradiated samples .",
    "figure [ fig : figure1 ] ( a ) shows the resistance of a bi@xmath0te@xmath1 single crystal measured in - situ , normalized to the initial resistance measured before irradiation , as a function of electron dose @xmath25 . the resistance first increases linearly up to a dose of around 50 mc / cm@xmath23 until it reaches a maximum of 1.5 - 1.6 times its initial value at @xmath27 80 - 90 mc / cm@xmath23 . with further irradition ,",

    "this study solely concerns the doping of bulk bi@xmath0te@xmath1 ; none of the irradiated samples displayed any features associated with surface carriers .",
    "however , since doping of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 using electron irradiation seems possible , it would be extremely interesting to perform these kind of irradiations on thinner bi@xmath0te@xmath1 samples on which the surface states already have been identified before irradiation . besides doping effects , irradiation of topological insulators could give new insight on the behaviour of the surface states with respect to disorder which up to now has only been studied theoretically @xcite .",
    "+ under high - energy electron irradiation , lattice atoms can be displaced by electrons or secondary knock - on atoms , if the energy of the projectile exceeds the threshold displacement energy @xmath22 of the different lattice atoms . due to the high energy of the electrons of 2.5 mev in the present study , the displacement of all different lattice atoms , i.e. , te1 , te2 , bi , as well as the displacement of the atoms on antisites is expected .",
    "however , regarding the higher total number of te sites ( ratio 3:2 ) and the lower displacement threshold of te1 atoms @xcite , one can assume a larger number of displaced te than bi atoms .",
    "since the irradiation temperature is relatively high , the displaced atoms as well as the created vacancies might form more stable interstitial or vacancy clusters or recombine with vacancies resulting in annihilation of defects or the creation of antisite defects . both hall effect measurements and",
    "the analysis of the observed sdh oscillations clearly indicate the electron donor character of the irradiation - induced defects .",
    "therefore , we assume te vacancy clusters and te@xmath7 antisite defects , both acting as electron dopants @xcite , to be the predominant defects .",
    "although the doping effect of te and bi interstitials has been less studied than the latter defects , te interstitials have also been assumed to act as electron donors in a previous study on proton - irradiated bi@xmath0te@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "transmission electron microscopy studies on these proton - irradiated samples showed the presence of interstitial and vacancy cluster @xcite .",
    "however , further detailed studies of the defects created by room and also low temperature irradiation are necessary to fully understand the damage formation in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 under irradiation .",
