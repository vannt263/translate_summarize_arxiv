    "in 1839 , the scottish astronomer thomas henderson learned of bessel s successful parallax measurement of @xmath2 for 61 cygni @xcite .",
    "bessel s result gave henderson the confidence to report his own measurement of a @xmath3 parallax for the @xmath0 centauri ab binary pair @xcite .",
    "henderson s distance determination of 0.86 pc for @xmath0 centauri is reasonably close to the modern estimate of 1.35 pc .",
    "@xmath0 centauri remained the closest known stellar system until the measurement of proxima centauri s parallax @xcite .",
    "proxima and @xmath0 centauri exert a special fascination by virtue of the fact that they are the sun s closest neighbors .",
    "their hold on the imagination is further strengthened by the remarkable similarities of the masses and ages of @xmath0 cen a and b to the sun .",
    "proxima lies a mere @xmath4 from the @xmath0 centauri binary pair , and it has a small relative velocity , @xmath5 with respect to @xmath0 cen .",
    "the likelihood of such a stellar configuration occurring purely by chance is less than @xmath6 @xcite , and based on this incredibly improbable arrangement , it has been suspected that the stars constitute a bound triple system ever since proxima s discovery @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of proxima and @xmath0 centauri have been most recently examined by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "both groups of authors showed that the ( then - current ) kinematic observations of the stars implied a positive total energy for the three - star system .",
    "@xcite sought to explain this somewhat disturbing result by hypothesizing that the measured masses of @xmath0 centauri ab were too low .",
    "they argued that a @xmath7 increase in the dynamical mass of the system would result in a bound configuration .",
    "@xcite suggested that the three stars are members of a `` stellar moving group '' , thus rendering proxima s apparently hyperbolic trajectory less of an unusual occurrence .",
    "in addition to the reasons presented by @xcite for the importance of understanding the dynamical condition of the @xmath0 cen system , proxima could also play a role in volatile enrichment of any terrestrial planets that might be orbiting either member of the central pair .",
    "a study by @xcite showed that terrestrial planets are dynamically stable when placed within 4 au from either star of the @xmath0 centauri binary pair .",
    "furthermore , accretion calculations by @xcite suggest that terrestrial planet formation could have readily occurred within the @xmath0-centauri system .",
    "one might therefore wonder about the habitability of putative terrestrial planets in the system .",
    "a possible concern with respect to habitability arises because any planets orbiting the @xmath0-centauri binary may be depleted in volatiles . if proxima were bound to the system during its formation stages , then",
    "it may have gravitationally stirred the circumbinary planetesimal disk of the @xmath0 centauri system , thereby increasing the delivery of volatile - rich material to the dry inner regions .",
    "the hipparcos satellite returned extremely accurate kinematic information on all three stars of the @xmath0 cen system @xcite .",
    "we can combine these data with mass and radial velocity information to formulate a complete dynamical picture of the system ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "the kinematic data in table  [ tbl-1 ] are consistent with a broad spectrum of dynamical configurations for the three stars .",
    "we wish to determine what fraction of these allowed configurations correspond to bound systems . in order to do this ,",
    "we perform an n=10000 monte carlo simulation by assuming that each observed parameter is independent and varies with a normal distribution implied by its 1-@xmath1 error .",
    "the only exception to the independence of the observations is that the parallaxes of @xmath0 cen a and b are set equal to each other within each realization , but still vary in a normal distribution from one realization to the next .",
    "we use observations of both @xmath0 cen a and b and the masses of each to calculate the properties of the center of mass of the a / b system .",
    "we calculate the gravitational binding energy @xmath8 between the center of mass of the @xmath0 cen a / b binary and proxima centauri .",
    "we did this by converting to cartesian coordinates and using cgs units with the simple formula @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the kinetic energies of the @xmath0 cen a / b center of mass and proxima centauri respectively and @xmath12 is the gravitational potential energy of the two point mass system .",
    "we first calculated the properties of the @xmath0 cen a / b / c system using our method , but with the old observational data used by @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we also restricted our errors in the n=1000 monte carlo simulation to within their 2-@xmath1 values .",
    "we find the a / b / c system is unbound with a probability of p=1.0 and that using the non - cgs ( simulation ) units from @xcite , the energy of the system was 5 @xmath13 5 which was consistent with their results of p=1.0 and energy=6 @xmath13 6 . using more accurate data from hipparcos @xcite , @xcite , and queloz , d. ( 2004 ) , not limiting the monte carlo errors to 2-@xmath1 and using cgs units in an n=10000 simulation , we find that the binding energy of the a / b / c system is now @xmath14 joules with an unbound probability of p=0.55 . with modern data it is now clear that almost half the realizations result in a bound triple system . using the centroid of each observation we can compute an estimate of the observed orbital characteristics of proxima centauri with respect to the center of mass of the a / b binary ( see table  2 ) .    for the case of a highly eccentric keplerian orbit",
    ", proxima centauri would spend most of its time near apastron .",
    "the current distance of proxima centauri from @xmath0 cen a / b is @xmath15 au , thus the estimated semi - major axis of 272212 au is almost certainly far too large .",
    "the velocity of proxima centauri relative to @xmath0 cen a / b in the monte carlo simulation is @xmath16 km  s@xmath17 .",
    "systems with a lower relative velocity generally result in a bound orbit while higher velocities tend to result in a hyperbolic orbit ( see figure  [ hist ] ) . according to observational data ,",
    "proxima centauri is right on the cusp of being unbound , but we expect to find proxima centauri near apastron , which requires a slightly smaller relative velocity .",
    "only p=0.025 of the runs had a low enough relative velocity to situate proxima centauri fairly near apastron . in figure  [ vr ]",
    ", we can see that the radial velocity of proxima centauri largely determines the energy of the resulting system and that a change of only 1 to 3-@xmath1 in that radial velocity can result in a bound system currently near apastron .",
    "the availability of hipparcos data has provided us with the ability to implement a significant improvement over previous studies of the alpha centauri system .",
    "our results indicate that it is quite likely that proxima centauri is gravitationally bound to the alpha centauri ab pair , thus suggesting that they formed together within the same birth aggregate , and that they three stars have the same ages and metallicities . as future observations",
    "bring increased accuracy to the kinematic measurements , it will likely become more obvious that proxima centauri is bound to the @xmath0 cen a / b binary and that proxima centauri is currently near the apastron of an eccentric orbit .",
    "( see figure  [ orbit ] ) .",
    "based on the expectation that the actual system is both bound and near apastron , we predict that improved measurements of proxima centauri s absolute radial velocity will yield a value of -22.3 km s@xmath18 km  s@xmath17 .",
