    "the determination of the abundances of the hot x - ray emitting gas in sb galaxies has traditionally suffered from large uncertainties .",
    "indeed , the low angular and spectral resolution of the various x - ray telescopes in the pre - xmm-_newton_/_chandra _ era did not allow to disentangle between point sources and hot gas emission , making abundance determinations severely model - dependent @xcite .",
    "the problem lies in the fact that the x  ray spectrum of sb galaxies contains two major components : the emission from hot diffuse gas and the integrated contribution of point sources .",
    "the first is described by an optically thin thermal spectrum _ plus _ emission lines , the latter by a power - law .",
    "if the angular resolution is not good enough , it is not possible to reliably subtract the point sources from the total spectrum , so that the equivalent widths of the emission lines ( and thus the element abundances ) are not unambiguously defined .    on the other hand ,",
    "high angular resolution alone is not enough : recent _ chandra _ studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) demonstrated that the relatively low spectral resolution of the acis detector makes individual element abundance analysis still problematic .",
    "the high spectral resolution of the _ chandra _ gratings rapidly degrades for sources which are much more extended than the instrumental _ point spread function _ ( psf ) and thus these gratings are almost useless for the study of nearby sb galaxies .",
    "however , by coupling the high angular resolution ( @xmath78 psf ) of _ chandra _ with the high spectral resolution ( @xmath79 ) of the xmm / rgs , which is not sensitive to the source extension , it is possible to overcome the above described difficulties .",

    "a cumulative spectrum of the brightest point sources was extracted from the two _ chandra _  acis - i observations ; the best - fit model was an absorbed power - law with @xmath80 @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , which is typical of high mass x ",

    "m82 was observed by xmm-_newton _  for 30 ks in may 2001 ; in the xmm-_newton_observation , after light - curve cleaning , @xmath86  ks of data were available for scientific analysis .",
    "we extracted the epic_pn _ spectrum from a circular region centered on the starbursting core of m82 and with a @xmath87 radius , which approximately matches the rgs psf ; the standard recipe for epic spectra extraction suggested in the xmm web pages was followed .",
    "the xmmsas software version 5.3.0 was used .",
    "a background spectrum was taken from standard background files provided by the xmm-_newton _  soc .",
    "rgs spectra were extracted with standard settings",
    "( i.e.  including events within 90% confidence and rejecting as background events those outside 95% of the psf figure ) ; this procedure is similar to the one used by @xcite  but with more recent calibrations .",
    "after visual inspection , we discarded the 2nd - order spectra because of low signal / noise ratio .",
    "we included in the fit only the 1st - order channels comprised in the 620 interval , since outside the s / n ratio rapidly drops .",
    "a systematic error up to 10% in the 1418   channels was included ( xmm calibration document xmm - soc - cal - tn-0030 issue 2 ) .    the hard  band ( 27 kev ) _",
    "chandra _  images show that the point sources emission largely exceeds that of the hot gas , while the hard part ( 37 kev ) of the _ pn _ spectrum can be well described by a power - law whose best - fit slope resulted in the same value previously determined for the _ chandra _  point sources .",
    "thus , making use of information from both _",
    "chandra _  and xmm-_newton _  observations",
    ", we have been able to constrain the point source slope , absorption and normalization at the moment of the xmm-_newton _  observation .",
    "we jointly fitted the _",
    "pn _ and rgs spectra with xspec version  11.2 ( see fig .",
    "[ xr ] ) with a two component model which is the sum of : _",
    "i ) _ an absorbed power - law ( accounting for point sources ) with the slope and absorption parameters fixed at the best fit values obtained with _",
    "chandra _  while normalization was left free to account for variability ; _ ii ) _ an absorbed , optically ",
    "thin thermal plasma emission , with variable line intensities and differential emission measure ( dem ) distribution .",
    "the dem distribution was modeled with a 6@xmath88 order chebyshev polynomial ( ` c6pvmkl ` model in xspec ) ; with the best - fit parameters it resembles a bell - shaped curve with a peak at @xmath89 kev and fwhm @xmath90 kev ( i.e.  the plasma temperatures range from @xmath910.35 kev to @xmath911 kev ) , in agreement with @xcite . the thermal component is absorbed by cold gas with best - fit column density @xmath92 @xmath81 .",
    "the confidence contours of the iron abundance versus normalization of the thermal component are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig - fevsnorm ] . as expected the two parameters are well correlated as the higher is the normalization of the continuum spectrum the lower is the intensity of the emission lines and in turn the element abundances .",
    "the derived abundances and their associated 90% confidence error are shown in table  [ ab ] .",
    "we notice that these abundances are about a factor 2 below those reported in @xcite ; we attribute the discrepancy to the different modeling of the continuum emission ( @xcite  did not include _ pn _ data , neither considered the contribution from point sources ) .",
    "however , it is worth of mentioning that both sets of abundances indicate a low o abundance compared to the other @xmath2-elements .    to further check the consistency and robustness of our estimates",
    ", we repeated the fit two times considering only the rgs data and using _",
    "i ) _ the above described thermal _ plus _ power - law model and _ ii ) _ a thermal model alone .",
    "this last check , in particular , most closely matches the analysis previously made by @xcite to the point that the discrepancies are within the errors and can be attributed to the differences in the used instrument calibration .",
    "the abundances derived from the three different models are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - abun ] .",
    "those obtained combining _",
    "pn _ and rgs have significantly smaller uncertainties .",
    "one can see that different models have mainly the effect to almost rigidly scale all the abundances , with minor impact on the abundance ratios .",
    "the low oxygen abundance is somehow difficult to explain in the framework of @xmath2-element enhancement by type ii sn explosions .",
    "thus , to check its reliability we included in the fit also the channels corresponding to the 2023   interval , where the ovii triplet is observed ( although with very few counts ) .",
    "we find no significant difference neither in oxygen abundance nor in dem distribution ( the oviii @xmath419/ovii @xmath422 ratio is extremely sensitive to the plasma temperature ) .",
    "ne is also somewhat under - abundant .",
    "we checked for possible instrumental effects , such as variations in the rgs effective area in proximity of the ne and o lines ; however the effective area in this region is a rather smooth function of the wavelength , so that there should be no instrumental issues and these low abundances are likely to be real .",
    "since m82 is observed edge  on , the x - ray emission of its nuclear region is subject to quite heavy absorption which could affect the o lines detected at low energies .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ovsnh ] , the contour plot of the oxygen abundance towards the foreground absorption , suggest a rather weak correlation . in the next section",
    "we discuss other physical possibilities to explain the o under - abundance issue .",
    "in m82 all the three components , namely hot and cold gas - phases and stars trace a very similar iron abundance , the average value being [ fe / h]@xmath93  dex .",
    "indeed , since iron is mainly produced by sne  ia , it is expected to be released in the ism only after @xmath94  gyr from the local onset of sf .    at variance ,",
    "@xmath95elements ( o , ne , mg , si , s , ca , ti ) are predominantly released by sne  ii with massive progenitors on much shorter timescales . + stars trace an average [ @xmath13si , mg , ca@xmath5/fe]@xmath96  dex , while the hot gas suggests an average [ @xmath13si , mg , s@xmath5/fe]@xmath97  dex .",
    "such an overall [ @xmath2/fe ] enhancement in m82 is fully consistent with a standard chemical evolution scenario , where the ism in the nuclear regions of massive sb galaxies is mainly enriched by the products of sne  ii explosions ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) occurring in recursive bursts of sf of relatively short duration .",
    "[ abtot ] shows the various abundance ratios relative to iron , as measured in stars , hot and cold gas - phases .",
    "since the cold gas - phase abundances are from different data sets in the literature , hence not homogeneously determined , the inferred abundance ratios should be regarded with caution .    when comparing the hot and cold gas - phase abundances , one finds ne over - abundant , si and especially s significantly under - abundant in the cold gas .",
    "@xcite suggests s and to a lower level si depletion onto interstellar dust grains .",
    "however , other metals like fe in particular , with even higher degree of incorporation into dust @xcite , should be severely depleted in the cold gas , which does not seem the case .",
    "a possible explanation is that the optical lines used to infer fe and o abundances @xcite and the the mid / far ir lines used to infer ne and s abundances @xcite trace different nebular sub - structures within the central few hundreds pc , somewhat chemically dishomogeneous or with different dust content .",
    "the [ o / fe ] abundance ratio in m82 is even more puzzling to interpret . before the onset of the current burst of sf ,",
    "the ism was enriched in o as well as in the other @xmath2-elements , as suggested by our stellar and cold gas - phase abundances .",
    "the o under - abundance measured in the hot gas can not be modeled with a standard nucleosynthesis from the present generation of sne  ii .",
    "@xcite suggested explosive nucleosynthesis in core - collapse hypernovae but they predicted a large under - abundance of ne and mg as well , which is not observed .",
    "[ o / fe ] under - abundance can be also explained with a major fe enrichment by current sn - ia explosions from previous generations of stars , but in this case all the [ @xmath2/fe ] ratios should be low , again contrary to what observed .",
    "o might be also locked into dust grains . indeed , sne  ii are known to produce significant amounts of dust @xcite and o , being a basic constituent of dust grains , is expected to suffer of severe dust depletion .",

    "<S> the near infrared ( ir ) absorption spectra of starburst galaxies show several atomic and molecular lines from red supergiants which can be used to infer reliable stellar abundances . </S>",
    "<S> the metals locked in stars give a picture of the galaxy metallicity prior to the last burst of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the enrichment of the new generation of stars born in the last burst can be traced by measuring the hot gas in the x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time detailed stellar abundances in the nuclear region of the starburst galaxy m82 have been obtained . </S>",
    "<S> they are compared with those of the hot gas as derived from an accurate re - analysis of the xmm-_newton _  and _ chandra _  nuclear x - ray spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the cool stars and the hot gas suggest [ fe / h]@xmath0  dex , and an overall [ si , mg / fe ] enhancement by @xmath10.4 and 0.5  dex , respectively . this is consistent with a major chemical enrichment by sne  ii explosions in recursive bursts on short timescales . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen is more puzzling to interpret since it is enhanced by @xmath10.3  dex in stars and depleted by @xmath10.2  dex in the hot gas . </S>",
    "<S> none of the standard enrichment scenarios can fully explain such a behavior when compared with the other @xmath2-elements . </S>"
