    "sliding friction is a fundamental problem which is actively being theoretically and experimentally studied at the micro- and nano - scale  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental advances have provided a significant amount of new information on the main characteristics of this phenomenon at small scales . as a consequence ,",
    "an important theoretical effort to understand qualitatively and quantitatively the experimental outcomes has been activated.@xcite in this frame , the problem of reducing friction is of utmost importance .",
    "traditional lubricants do not represent a valuable mean to achieve this goal in atomic - scale contacts , since the hydrocarbon chains forming the lubricants cause high viscosity when confined in nm - sized interstices  @xcite . an efficient alternative is given by mechanical oscillations applied to the sliding system  @xcite .",
    "this has been shown in the atomic force microscopy ( afm ) experiments in refs .   and   in which a dramatic reduction of friction was observed when the oscillations were applied perpendicularly to the sliding plane ( _ out - of - plane _ ) and frequencies corresponding to mechanical resonances of the probing tip coupled to the surface were chosen . in the same way",
    "_ could drive a silicon tip over a distance of several hundred meters on a polymer surface without observing abrasive wear  @xcite .",
    "although the influence of out - of - plane oscillations on sliding friction can be related to a periodic decrease of the energy corrugation experienced by the slider  @xcite , systematic theoretical investigations of this effect at different temperatures have not been reported so far , which is possibly due to the lack of corresponding experimental results .",
    "the same can be said in the case of mechanical vibrations applied along the sliding direction ( _ in - plane _ ) .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite have shown a significant reduction of the average friction force at the atomic scale caused by lateral vibrations applied to a nanotip elastically pulled on a flat crystal surface . here , we will try to model this type of _ in - plane _ actuation .",
    "note that this experimental situation is different from the substrate vibration problem studied numerically in  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we present detailed numerical simulations of sliding friction on the atomic scale in the presence of out - of - plane and in - plane ac fields .",
    "results are obtained for different values of the four main parameters of the system : frequency and amplitude of the ac field , sliding velocity , and temperature .",
    "friction force is reduced in well - defined frequency windows , and the effect is enhanced at increasing temperature and actuation amplitude .",
    "an analytical formula explaining the gradual transition from stick - slip to superlubricity at @xmath0  k is also derived .",
    "regarding the thermal behavior of the system , we show how our numeric results scale following the law given by reaction rate theory , commonly used to predict the temperature dependence of atomic - scale friction in absence of mechanical vibrations .",
    "quantitative agreement is also obtained if appropriate effective parameters are introduced .",
    "in order to analyze ac - actuation effects on atomic - scale friction , we start from the one - dimensional prandtl - tomlinson ( pt ) model including thermal effects  @xcite : @xmath1 here , a single particle of mass @xmath2 , representing the afm tip apex , is driven along a periodic substrate , experiencing an effective potential @xmath3 .",
    "this potential includes an elastic contribution , @xmath4 , and a tip - substrate interaction term , @xmath5 .",
    "the first term describes the combined effect of the lateral deformation of the elastic cantilever support ( moving at a constant velocity @xmath6 , so its position is @xmath7 ) , the deformation of the tip apex , and of the sample surface : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is an effective spring constant  @xcite . in the first order approximation",
    "the tip - surface interaction is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the spatial periodicity of the surface lattice .",
    "the random noise term @xmath12 is related to the temperature @xmath13 by the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a microscopic friction coefficient describing the coupling with phonon and possible electron oscillations in the substrate , and @xmath16 is the boltzmann constant .     and laterally pulled by a flexible cantilever at a constant velocity @xmath6 .",
    "the surface sample ( or , equivalently , the free end of the cantilever ) is shaken either in the normal or in the lateral direction .",
    "portraits of the potential energy @xmath17 when the cantilever is set in motion are shown for ( b ) out - of - plane actuation and ( c ) in - plane actuation ( in this case the red lines show the time variation of the elastic energy @xmath4 ) .",

    "( [ pot2 ] ) the parameter @xmath25 quantifies the relative amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "the variation of the total potential @xmath26 during an oscillation is sketched in fig .",

    "actuation forces are effective for friction reduction in an intermediate range of frequencies .",
    "this range is limited by the washboard frequency of the system , associated to the motion at a given velocity over a periodic potential , and by the frequency value at which the relaxation time of the system becomes comparable to the actuation period so that the system becomes unable to follow the dynamics of the ac force .",
    "the first frequency is essentially given by the drag velocity of the support , @xmath6 ; the second one is determined by the effective damping @xmath44 of the system .",
