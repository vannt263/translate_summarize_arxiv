    "searching for majorana fermions ( mfs ) in condensed matter systems has attracted intensive studies in past years @xcite , due to the fundamental interest in exploring the new type of particles fulfilling non - abelian statistics and the potential applications for the topological quantum computing @xcite . among various proposals for realizing the emergent mfs ,",
    "the quantum wires with p - wave pairings provide promising candidates for realizing emergent mfs at the ends of wires .",
    "as shown in the original work of kitaev @xcite , boundary mfs emerge in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) p - wave superconductor if the system is in a topological phase .",
    "moreover , quantum wires with a strong spin - orbit coupling , or topologically insulating wires , subject to a zeeman magnetic field and in proximity of a superconductor , are found to exhibit boundary mfs @xcite .",
    "particularly , experimental signatures of mfs in hybrid superconductor - semiconductor nanowires have been reported very recently @xcite , which stimulates the study of exploring mfs in 1d systems @xcite .",
    "schemes of realizing majorana chains have also been proposed in cold atomic systems @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , superconducting ( sc ) circuits @xcite and quantum - dot - superconductor arrays @xcite .    as most of theoretical works focus on ideal homogeneous wires with a uniform chemical potential , an important problem is the stability of the mfs under the modulation of density and disorder . in this work ,",
    "we explore the nonuniform p - wave sc wires with a periodic modulation of the chemical potential , extending the kitaev s p - wave sc model @xcite , and study the fate of the mfs under the density modulation and disorder . in general , a periodically modulated potential is of benefit to the formation of periodic density waves .",
    "if the modulation amplitude is large , one may expect that the sc phase could be destroyed .",
    "as the robustness of majorana mode is protected by the sc gap , the mfs may be unstable in the presence of density modulation and disorder .",
    "on the other hand , recent work on the density modulated wires in the absence of sc order parameter indicates the existence of topologically protected edge states @xcite .",
    "so far , it is unclear whether the majorana edge states is enhanced or suppressed under the density modulation .",
    "the current work will focus on this problem and show the robustness of majorana edge states against the density modulation and disorder .",
    "particularly , in some parameter regimes , we find that mfs always exist for the arbitrarily strong modulation strength , which may shed light on the design of quantum architectures producing robust mfs .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the density modulated p - wave superconductor model and derive the bogoliubov - de gennes equations in section [ model ] , and demonstrate the zero mode majorana edge states , which strongly depend on the phase shift , in spectra and wave functions in section [ majorana ] . in order to confirm the transition , we define a @xmath0 topological invariant in section [ z2 ] .",
    "further we use the definition of the invariant to derive the phase boundaries in section [ pd ] .",
    "the spectral function is calculated in section [ ssf ] with a zero - energy peak detected corresponding to the zero majorana modes .",
    "section [ summary ] gives a summary .",
    "we consider a typical lattice model of the 1d p - wave superconductor with modulated chemical potentials , which is described by @xmath1 , \\label{ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of fermions at the _ i_-th site , @xmath4 the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude , @xmath5 the p - wave sc order parameter and chosen real , and the modulated chemical potential given by @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the strength , @xmath8 a rational number ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 are co - prime integers ) , and @xmath11 an arbitrary phase shift .",
    "the modulated chemical potential can be generated by the bichromatic optical lattice for cold atom systems @xcite or through the control of gates for quantum - dot arrays and quantum wires @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we only consider the case with @xmath12 being a rational number .",
    "for the incommensurate case with @xmath12 being an irrational number , the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) with @xmath13 reduces to the aubry - andr model @xcite , for which the system undergoes a delocalization to localization transition when @xmath14 .",
    "correspondingly , the sc system with nonzero @xmath5 and irrational @xmath12 also undergoes a transition from a topological phase to a topologically trivial localized phase when @xmath7 exceeds a critical value @xcite .    in order to diagonalize the quadratic form hamiltonian , we resort to the bogoliubove - de gennes transformation @xcite and define a set of new fermionic operators , @xmath15 ,   \\nonumber \\\\ \\eta _ { n}^{\\dag } = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{l}[(\\phi _ { n , i}+\\psi _ { n , i})c_{i}^{\\dag } + ( \\phi _ { n , i}-\\psi _",

    "one can judge whether the zero mode solution exists by evaluating the two eigenvalues of the product matrix @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "if both of them are either smaller or greater than unity , there is a zero mode solution with mfs located at the ends , otherwise no zero mode solution is available . solving eqs .",
    "( [ coupled ] ) , we can get the whole excitation spectrum for the single quasi - particles . to give typical examples of @xmath64 and @xmath65",

    "it is shown that under obc , there are zero modes in the bulk gap for the whole phase parameter space when @xmath7 is small .",
    "as @xmath7 increases , the excitation gap shrinks ; when it exceeds a critical value , the gaps for some @xmath11 s close and then reopen with zero modes vanishing , corresponding to a transition from the topological phase to the topologically trivial phase , and the regimes for the existence of the zero modes in the phase parameter space become narrow .",
    "however , our numerical results indicate that the zero mode majorana solutions _ always _ exist at some specific values of @xmath11 , such as @xmath67 for @xmath64 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 , no matter how strong the strength @xmath7 is ( fig.[spec ] and fig.[gap ] ) . to understand it , we observe that these @xmath11 s have an exotic characteristic , that is , each of them makes the value of @xmath70 zero for one of the sites , @xmath71 , in a supercell composed of @xmath10 sites , independent of the strength of the modulated potential @xmath7 .",
    "the fine tunability of the phase shift @xmath11 effectively reduces the boundary potential and makes it possible to exist majorana boundary states even for very large @xmath7 .",
    "this reminds us that we have the exact majorana edge states for zero chemical potential in non - modulated systems @xcite .",

    "the non - permutated term , @xmath140 , gives @xmath141 .",

    "@xmath152 @xmath149 and @xmath153 , which gives @xmath154 .",

    "our numerical study shows that when @xmath155 and @xmath156 , the sum of all terms generated by the first kind of permutations is zero except the full - permutated ones ( if there is ) without any @xmath157 left .",
    "so the first kind contributes a term of @xmath158 for odd @xmath10 s or @xmath159 for even @xmath10 s .",

    "the above results show that the phase boundary formula is different for @xmath10 being even or odd .",

    "only the number of these points are different , i.e. , @xmath10 for even cases and @xmath175 for odd cases .",

    "meanwhile , the bulk energy bands are broadened by the disorder , and other peaks are not stable under disorder as the zero peak .",
