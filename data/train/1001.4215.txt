    "monte carlo studies of 4-dimensional su(3 ) gauge theory @xcite and parallel studies of 2-dimensional @xmath1 models @xcite have shown that the topological charge density in the vacuum of these theories is dominated by extended coherent codimension - one sheets .",
    "these results point to a new paradigm for the physical vacuum of asymptotically free gauge theories .",
    "the vacuum appears to be a laminated `` topological sandwich '' consisting of densely packed , alternating sign membranes of topological charge .",
    "the possible interpretation of these topological charge membranes as the holographic dual of d6 branes in witten s type iia string theory formulation of holographic qcd @xcite has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "locally , the membranes are flat , parallel , alternating in sign , and roughly equally spaced . over larger distances",
    "they bend and fold such that the local orientation of the topological sandwich decorrelates over distances large compared to the confinement scale .",
    "( this last statement is based mainly on visual inspection of @xmath1 gauge configurations for various correlation lengths . )",
    "-0.15 in    0.15 in    -0.15 in    0.15 in    an important characteristic of the observed charge membranes is that both the transverse thickness of the branes and the typical separation between adjacent , oppositely charged branes is roughly constant in lattice units , of order a few lattice spacings .",
    "this basic structure leads to the characteristic behavior of the topological charge two - point correlator , which consists of a narrow positive peak at @xmath10 and a negative tail with a pronounced negative dip at a separation of around 2 lattice spacings as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qcd_2point ] for 4-dimensional @xmath0 gauge theory and in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpn_2point ] for the 2-dimensional @xmath11 model .",
    "the position of the negative dip remains roughly the same in lattice units over a wide range of correlation lengths .",
    "thus , both the thickness and the typical spacing of the topological charge sheets goes to zero with the lattice spacing in the continuum limit . at first one might wonder if structure that varies rapidly at the cutoff scale can or should influence long range physics in the continuum limit .",
    "but it is easily seen numerically that the membranes are responsible for building up an _ expected _ positive delta - function contact term in the topological charge correlator @xcite . the contribution of this contact term to the topological susceptibility @xmath12 , ( given by the integrated correlator ) does not go away in the continuum limit , but in fact combines with the contribution of the negative tail at @xmath13 to give a positive topological susceptibility which scales properly with the mass gap .",
    "( this is true for 4-dimensional @xmath0 gauge theory and 2-dimensional @xmath1 for @xmath14 .",
    "the only exceptions are the @xmath15 and @xmath16 models , which are dominated by small instantons and do not exhibit proper scaling for @xmath12 @xcite . )",
    "the laminated structure appearing at the cutoff scale is thus essential for obtaining the proper continuum physics . among other things ,",
    "the topological sandwich vacuum serves as a medium which supports the physical fluctuations of topological charge density in the vacuum , which arise from the bends , folds , phonons , and other deviations from a regular one - dimensional crystal structure .",
    "this has the notable effect of replacing locally quantized instanton fluctuations , which would exist in the perturbative vacuum , with unquantized gaussian fluctuations .",
    "( topological charge can flow to and from infinity in a continuous way along the membranes . )",
    "the relaxation of the local quantization constraint causes the @xmath17-dependence of the vacuum energy to change from the instanton gas prediction @xmath18 to the large n prediction @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo evidence suggests that , with a finite cutoff , the perturbative vacuum of an asymptotically free confining gauge theory has an instability toward lamination along some direction , and that this lamination characterizes the transition from the perturbative vacuum to the physical , confining vacuum . in this paper",
    "i will explore the remarkable similarity between the layered , alternating - sign topological sandwich structure observed in the monte carlo studies and a well - known but somewhat mysterious structure in string theory called a `` tachyonic crystal '' @xcite .",
    "this is a layered , alternating sign , one - dimensional array of codimension - one @xmath20 branes , which arises from the tachyonic decay of an unstable @xmath21 brane . in the iia formulation of holographic qcd",
    ", the topological sandwich of d6 branes can be intepreted as the stable tachyonic crystal which arises from the decay of a single spacetime filling @xmath5 brane .",
    "( both the @xmath2 branes and the @xmath5 brane are wrapped around a compact @xmath3 and thus appear as 3- and 4-dimensional objects , respectively , in 4-dimensional spacetime . ) in this framework , the homogeneous but unstable @xmath5 brane embodies the axial @xmath22 symmetry associated with the @xmath17-parameter of the gauge theory .",
    "its decay to an array of @xmath2 branes breaks this symmetry , thus implementing the axial @xmath22 anomaly and producing a physical vacuum with nonzero topological susceptibility .",
    "the boundary conformal field theory ( bcft ) methods which provide the framework for our understanding of unstable brane decay @xcite should thus be directly applicable to the description of the physical vacuum in asymptotically free gauge theories .    in order to gain a clearer understanding of the formation and properties of the topological sandwich vacuum",
    ", we will explore these issues in the 2-dimensional @xmath1 model , where we already have some understanding of the physical vacuum based on large n analysis .",
    "since they were first introduced , the @xmath1 models have served as an instructive example of topological charge structure which is in many ways quite similar to 4-dimensional @xmath23 gauge theory .",
    "the study of topological charge distributions in monte carlo generated @xmath1 gauge configurations has revealed a topological sandwich structure of extended coherent codimension - one objects @xcite , completely analogous to the structure found in qcd .",
    "the @xmath1 model may be formulated as a theory of n complex scalar fields @xmath24 , interacting with an auxiliary @xmath22 gauge field @xmath7 and a scalar lagrange multiplier field @xmath8 ( which incorporates the constraint @xmath25 ) . in the large n approximation ( with a momentum space cutoff ) , the @xmath26 field acquires a vev , which gives a mass to the @xmath27 particles . with massive @xmath27 s",
    ", the one loop effective action for the gauge field acquires an @xmath28 term , producing a linear coulomb potential which confines @xmath22 charge .",
    "we will show , by writing the z - particle propagator in a proper time representation , that the @xmath1 model can be obtained from the @xmath29 limit of a bosonic open string theory with one end interacting with a background gauge field @xmath30 and tachyon field @xmath31 . in this formulation of the model ,",
    "the string length @xmath32 serves as a short distance cutoff and plays a role analogous to the lattice spacing in the lattice formulation of the cutoff theory . with this string theoretic cutoff",
    ", we can relate the dynamics of the @xmath1 model to that of a boundary conformal field theory ( bcft ) , where the tachyon background @xmath31 admits an exactly marginal , oscillatory boundary perturbation of the form @xcite @xmath33\\ ] ] here @xmath34 is the endpoint coordinate of an open bosonic string , given by the boundary value on the real axis of holomorphic and antiholomorphic conformal fields in the upper half plane .",
    "the phase of the parameter @xmath35 fixes the overall position of the oscillating field along the @xmath36 axis . from here on we will take @xmath35 to be real and positive .",
    "sen has shown that this boundary perturbation ( [ eq : marginal ] ) represents the euclidean world sheet view of the homogeneous decay of an unstable d - brane @xcite .",
    "the theory without a boundary term ( @xmath37 ) corresponds to neumann boundary conditions on the @xmath36 coordinate , i.e. a homogeneous d - brane spanning that coordinate . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the perturbation ( [ eq : marginal ] ) is marginal and belongs to an su(2 ) current algebra .",
    "as we discuss in the following section , this boundary deformation preserves world sheet conformal symmetry , and the open string spectrum is obtained in terms of @xmath22 kac - moody modules of a `` phase shifted '' sugawara hamiltonian . at a critical value @xmath39",
    "the b.c.s on @xmath36 become pure dirichlet conditions . in space - time , this represents the background state reached after the brane decay process is complete , consisting of an alternating - sign codimension - one array of d - branes arranged along the @xmath36 direction in a one - dimensional tachyonic crystal @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 model is a nonlinear sigma model of @xmath9 self - interacting complex scalar fields @xmath40 with the constraint @xmath25 .",
    "the most convenient formulation of the model for our purposes is obtained by introducing an auxiliary abelian gauge field @xmath7 .",
    "then the action consists solely of a gauge covariant kinetic term , @xmath41 here we will denote the @xmath1 coupling constant by @xmath42 ( rather than the more conventional @xmath35 ) to avoid confusion with the coefficient of the boundary perturbation . in ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) the covariant derivative is @xmath43 . note that there is no @xmath28 term for the gauge field , so @xmath44 is a dummy field whose equation of motion sets it equal to the @xmath22 current , @xmath45 if the @xmath44 field is integrated out , the theory can be written as a nonlinear sigma model of self - interacting @xmath27 s . because of the absence of a kinetic term for the gauge field , the model is classically conformally invariant .",
    "it acquires a mass scale via dimensional transmutation , as in 4-dimensional qcd .",
    "an @xmath28 term for the gauge field is generated by loop effects , as can be seen explicitly in the large @xmath9 solution @xcite .",
    "this produces a linear coulomb potential which confines @xmath22 charge .",
    "the generation of a kinetic term in the effective gauge action is a direct consequence of the dynamical generation of a mass for the @xmath27-particles . in large n",
    ", the transition from the perturbative to the physical vacuum is constrained by a one - loop consistency condition which determines the `` constituent '' mass of the @xmath27 particles . in our string - cutoff theory",
    ", we will show that this transition is described in terms of the marginal boundary perturbation ( [ eq : marginal ] ) in the bcft for a massless scalar field on the string world sheet .    to clarify the connection between the @xmath1 model and boundary cft , it is useful to introduce a proper time formalism",
    ". first let us impose the constraint @xmath25 via an auxilary lagrange multiplier field , @xmath46 thus the model reduces to charged scalar particles interacting with a real scalar field @xmath8 and a vector field @xmath7 .",
    "we will focus on the two - point function for @xmath27 particles , @xmath47 by introducing a proper time variable , we can replace the path integral over the @xmath27 fields by an integral over spacetime particle paths @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",

    "so far we have not explicitly introduced an ultraviolet cutoff . in a continuum formulation of the large @xmath9 approximation",
    "an ordinary momentum space cutoff can be used .",
    "a lattice formulation of the @xmath1 model provides a more general nonperturbative cutoff procedure , but , as discussed in the introduction , monte carlo results raise subtle issues regarding the scaling behavior of the topological susceptibility @xmath12 in the continuum limit of the lattice cutoff @xcite .",
    "the dominance of topological charge structures with transverse size of order the lattice spacing ( pointlike instantons for small @xmath9 and line - like excitations for @xmath56 @xcite ) clearly indicates that the structure of the nonperturbative vacuum is crucially affected by gauge field dynamics taking place at or near the cutoff scale . in this paper we explore this dynamics by introducing a cutoff at short proper time , @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : propertime ] ) @xcite . as a nonperturbative regulator",
    ", the proper time cutoff procedure provides a viable alternative to the lattice formulation of the model .",
    "moreover , it leads rather naturally to a string - theoretic ultraviolet completion in which the @xmath1 field theory is obtained as the @xmath29 limit of an open string theory . in the string theory completion of this model ,",
    "the parameter @xmath32 plays a role analogous to lattice spacing in the lattice cutoff . in the field theory limit",
    "the strings become very short , and the world sheet parametrization of the string coordinates @xmath58 reduces to the proper time parametrization of the particle path @xmath48 .",
    "the open string propagator reduces to the propagator for the @xmath1 field @xmath59 . for the full string theory , the contribution of massive string excitations to the propagator at a given proper time",
    "is determined by an elliptic modulus parameter @xmath60 . for @xmath61 ,",
    "only the lowest mass states contribute significantly ( including the tachyon , which is associated with the vacuum instability as we discuss below ) .",
    "thus , in the proper time decomposition of the propagator , the stringy corrections affect the theory only at proper time separations comparable to or smaller than @xmath62 , and we can regard the `` string length '' @xmath63 as a short distance cutoff .",
    "it is important for the following analysis that both the lagrange multiplier field @xmath26 and the gauge field @xmath44 are introduced as",
    "_ boundary terms _ ( rather than bulk terms ) on the open string world sheet . in this way , the spacetime conformal symmetry is broken but conformal symmetry on the world sheet may be preserved by certain boundary fields . as is familiar in string theory ,",
    "the boundary perturbations that preserve worldsheet conformal symmetry correspond to background fields which satisfy the spacetime equations of motion .",
    "we will use this connection in section v to obtain the effective space - time gauge action and compare it with the large @xmath9 result .    from the expression ( [ eq : propertime ] ) for the two - point function we determine the path- and field - dependent action for @xmath27-particle propagation in the @xmath1 model to be ( up to an overall constant which determines the scale of the proper time parameter @xmath64 ) @xmath65 the string theoretic cutoff procedure described above consists of identifying the path action ( [ eq : pathaction ] ) as the @xmath66 limit of the worldsheet action for an open bosonic string coordinate @xmath67 , @xmath68 the bulk term is the usual cft for a bosonic string coordinate , defined inside a rectangular area @xmath69 of width @xmath70 and length @xmath71 in the complex @xmath72 plane .",

    "may also be understood by writing the one - loop vacuum amplitude for an open string in a spectral representation which sums over intermediate open string states .",
    "this spectral analysis also exposes the essential role of the open string tachyon , and its connection to the instability of the @xmath78 vacuum seen in the large @xmath9 field theory .",
    "let us begin by considering the one - loop vacuum string amplitude @xmath79 without background fields ( i.e. @xmath80 ) .",
    "this amplitude has the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 here the sum is over all open string states satisfying the specified boundary conditions , and we consider only the motion of the string coordinates in 2-dimensional euclidean spacetime . with neumann boundary conditions and in the absence of background fields , it is straightforward to separate the virasoro eigenvalues into a @xmath83 term from translational motion and an @xmath84 term from internal motion . for general background fields ,",
    "such a separation is not possible , but we will consider a background @xmath31 field that depends on only one spatial coordinate @xmath36 , and is periodic in that coordinate , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the self - dual radius . for this case , the open string spectrum exhibits a band structure that can be understood in terms of bloch wave states , as discussed in the next section . [ in the case of hqcd , the justification for considering solutions which depend on only one spacetime coordinate follows from the observation that , while the @xmath5 brane , which represents the perturbative vacuum , is non - bps and unstable to tachyonic decay , the d6 branes which result from lamination along one coordinate direction are bps and stable against further dimensional collapse . ]    for the free string with @xmath78 , a crucial feature of the sum over discrete string states ( [ eq : partition ] ) is that it yields an amplitude with modular properties characterized by an elliptic nome @xmath87 for a single compactified bosonic coordinate at the radius @xmath88 satisfying neumann boundary conditions at both ends of the string , the sum over states in ( [ eq : partition ] ) gives @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "the factor @xmath91 reflects the negative mass squared of the tachyon mode .",
    "physically , this mode arises as a casimir effect from the zero - point energy of the open string oscillators .",
    "the presence of a tachyon mode in the string - theoretic completion of the @xmath1 model is a signal that the perturbative vacuum in the cutoff field theory is unstable toward tachyon condensation .",
    "note that the mass of the tachyon is of order the cutoff scale , just like the positive mass - squared states of the string .",
    "however , unlike the positive states , the tachyon does not decouple in the continuum limit , but in fact drives the transition from the perturbative vacuum to the physical vacuum .",
    "the scenario for this transition follows sen s description of the tachyon - induced decay of an unstable d - brane @xcite .",
    "boundary conformal field theory for the type iia string in d - brane backgrounds should play a role in the description of the qcd vacuum analogous to the treatment of the @xmath1 model that we consider in this paper . in both cases , we are dealing with the laminar collapse of a spacetime filling d - brane which occurs locally along a single coordinate direction , with the bcft for that coordinate acquiring a tachyonic boundary perturbation .",
    "for the oscillatory boundary perturbation @xmath93 the spectrum and partition function for the bosonic string have been analyzed both for the case @xmath88 and @xmath92 in refs .",
    "here we are interested in the bulk properties of the zero temperature @xmath1 model , so the case @xmath92 is most directly relevant to our discussion .",
    "however , it is instructive to first review the properties of the string spectrum with coordinate compactified at the @xmath94 radius @xmath95 . the spectrum at @xmath92",
    "can then be understood in terms of bloch wave states .",

    "note that the spacing between branes is set by the periodicity of the boundary perturbation ( [ eq : marginal2 ] ) , @xmath96 .",
    "this period is also the circumference of the compactified coordinate at the @xmath94 radius , so the theory at the @xmath94 compactification point describes a unit cell of the tachyonic crystal in the @xmath92 theory .    for nonzero @xmath35 ,",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum of the @xmath92 theory consists of bands separated by gaps . just as in the case of an ordinary particle in a periodic crystal , there are two complementary viewpoints to describe the spectrum of bands and band gaps , the tight binding approximation ( tba ) and the nearly - free string ( nfs ) approximation . in the tba",

    "each eigenstate on the unit cell gives rise to a band of eigenvalues for the @xmath92 theory .",
    "the critical boundary perturbation @xmath39 corresponds to the tight binding limit , in which the states in a band become degenerate , and the spectrum for @xmath92 is just a replication , on each cell , of the discrete spectrum at the su(2 ) radius .",
    "this is the case when the end of the string is firmly stuck to a single d - brane of the tachyonic crystal and does not hop to neighboring cells , so it behaves the same as in the compactified theory . for subcritical boundary perturbations , @xmath97 , propagating states and momentum dependence for the energy eigenvalues within a band",
    "arise from mixing between the states on neighboring unit cells . on the other hand , for @xmath98 ,",

    "but we can also view the amplitude as describing the propagation of a closed string between two boundary states .",
    "the field theory limit from this viewpoint is the limit of vanishing propagation time between the two closed string boundary states and the vacuum amplitude reduces to the overlap between the boundary states . in this way",

    "defining @xmath148 we can write the string generalization of the large @xmath9 gap equation ( [ eq : gapeq ] ) as @xmath149 actually , from the os / cs viewpoint the ultraviolet divergent ( @xmath150 ) part of the integrand on the right hand side of ( [ eq : string_gapeq ] ) should be moved to the left hand side , since it is properly interpreted as coming from infrared behavior of the closed string channel , using the os / cs duality transform ( [ eq : oscs ] ) .",
    "the closed string view provides additional insight into the nature of the excitations in the tachyonic crystal vacuum .",
    "while the open string represents the @xmath27-particle in the field theory limit , the closed string states which arise by a dual transformation of the open string loop are associated with gauge excitations and wilson loop operators in the field theory .",
    "the boundary states in the closed string channel correspond to different configurations of d - branes in the spacetime background .",
    "low lying excitations in this channel describe collective transverse modes of the codimension - one d - branes in the tachyonic crystal and are thus associated with topological charge fluctuations in the field theory . for finite cutoff @xmath151 ,",
    "the ultraviolet limit of the loop integrand in ( [ eq : string_gapeq ] ) is controlled by the limit @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) , i.e. by the low energy or long range limit of the closed string channel .",
    "this is an example of a general feature of string theory , that ultraviolet divergences can be reinterpreted as infrared divergences in the dual channel . in the next section",
    ", we will investigate the effective action of the gauge field @xmath44 coupled to the open string as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : boundary ] ) .",
    "a central feature of the large n solution in @xmath1 is the appearance of a dynamically generated linear confining coulomb potential between charged @xmath27-particles .",
    "this arises from the fact that , although the bare lagrangian does not include an @xmath154 term , such a term appears in the effective gauge potential at the one - loop level .",
    "this is seen by computing the one - loop photon self energy given by the diagrams in fig .",
    "3 ( with @xmath27-propagators of mass @xmath139 ) . in the limit @xmath155",
    ", this gives a self - energy tensor of the form @xmath156 with @xmath157 .",
    "this corresponds to a one - loop contribution to the effective gauge potential , @xmath158 this promotes the auxiliary gauge field @xmath44 to a full dynamical maxwell field , and in particular , leads to a linear confining potential between charged @xmath27 s .    in this section",
    "we discuss the effective gauge potential in the string theoretic cutoff theory .",
    "thus we consider an open string coupled to a background abelian gauge field by the wilson line interaction , eq .",

    "this problem has been studied in the context of boundary conformal field theory in ref .",
    "@xcite . to present a self - contained discussion",
    ", we briefly summarize the results needed to obtain the effective gauge potential for the @xmath1 model .",
    "the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite relies on an essential idea in the dynamics of strings in background fields .",
    "that is that the space - time equations of motion for the background field are given by the requirement that the wilson line boundary term in the bcft preserves the conformal invariance of the world sheet theory . to determine the spacetime equations of motion for the gauge field , we compute the cft beta function associated with the boundary term and set it equal to zero .",
    "the appropriate beta function is defined by introducing a renormalization counterterm for the wilson line boundary interaction of the form @xmath159 in the cft calculation of the counterterm , an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath144 must be introduced . the beta function which determines the conformal symmetry of the boundary term is then @xmath160 the requirement that this beta function should vanish leads to the spacetime gauge field eom , @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 . to",
    "leading order in @xmath62 , this is just maxwell s equation .",
    "in fact , the exact equation of motion ( [ eq : eom ] ) can be derived from an effective gauge action of the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) form , @xmath164 in the @xmath29 limit , this coincides with the large @xmath9 result @xmath165 .",
    "but the fact that the full action in the string - theoretic formulation is of the dbi form has very interesting implications for the dynamics of electric flux - string formation @xcite . since the coulomb force in two dimensions is linearly confining even in perturbation theory , one might not expect the confinement mechanism exhibited by the @xmath1 model to be particularly illuminating for 4-dimensional qcd .",
    "but the connection between 2- and 4-dimensional confinement appears to be much closer if we view confinement in the @xmath1 model in the context of brane dynamics in a tachyonic crystal vacuum .",
    "electric flux tubes are associated with transverse motion of the branes ( since they are fundamental strings ) .",
    "thus the spatial dimensionality of the electric flux distribution between charges is determined by the codimensionality of the branes , suggesting a straightforward generalization of this mechanism to 4-dimensional qcd . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite linear strings of electric flux arise from the dbi action by considering a point - charge source for a gauge field living on a d - brane . in order to construct a bps configuration ,",
    "the source must be accompanied by a transverse fluctuation of the brane localized in the vicinity of the point source .",
    "this spike - like excitation can be interpreted as a fundamental string attached to the brane , or equivalently a tube of electric flux attached to the source .",
    "the fact that the transverse excitation is string - like and highly localized in the brane coordinates depends crucially on the specific nonlinearities of the dbi gauge action @xcite .",
    "similarly , one may construct a bps configuration with a transverse string passing through the brane . again",
    "the dbi dynamics will constrict the region through which the flux passes to a narrow tube .",
    "this analysis suggests that a tachyonic crystal of codimension - one d - branes will support string - like excitations which are stretched along the direction transverse to the local orientation of the branes .",
    "in this paper i have explored a scenario for the breakdown of the perturbative vacuum in asymptotically free gauge theory and the appearance of the physical vacuum as a laminated array of codimension - one membranes .",
    "the evidence that such a lamination of the vacuum occurs in 4-dimensional @xmath0 yang - mills theory first appeared in monte carlo studies of topological charge @xcite . in holographic qcd ,",
    "the relevance of d6-branes for topological charge dynamics was first pointed out by witten @xcite .",
    "this work showed that , in large @xmath9 hqcd , the basic objects that should appear in the vacuum as the carriers of topological charge should be codimension - one membranes rather than localized , quantized instantons .",
    "the observation of codimension - one topological charge membranes in monte carlo configurations provided a direct confirmation of witten s arguments .",
    "in addition , the monte carlo results showed that , not only does topological charge appear in the form of thin , extended , coherent membranes , but that the vacuum was essentially filled with a topological sandwich of closely spaced , alternating sign membranes .",
    "the central argument of this paper is that the observed alternating - sign sandwich array has a precise holographic interpretation as a tachyonic crystal , the expected decay product of a homogeneous , space - filling d7-brane .",
    "this presents an appealing scenario for the breakdown of the perturbative vacuum and the transition to the physical one by a lamination process that can be described in terms of an exactly marginal boundary perturbation in the conformal field theory of the coordinate along which the lamination occurs . in this respect",
    ", the local description of the vacuum lamination phenomenon should be very similar for 2-dimensional @xmath1 and 4-dimensional qcd , since both dynamics are described by the bcft for a single spatial coordinate transverse to the array of codimension - one d - branes .    to provide further support for the tachyon crystal model of the gauge theory vacuum",
    ", we presented a detailed discussion of this scenario in the @xmath1 model , which provides a two - dimensional model with a topological charge structure very similar to qcd . for our discussion of the @xmath1 model ,",
    "the full superstructure of a gauge / gravity dual was not necessary to arrive at the bcft which describes the tachyonic decay of the vacuum .",
    "instead we showed that the @xmath1 model could be formulated as the field theoretic limit of an open bosonic string in background fields @xmath26 and @xmath44 . in a proper time formulation ,",
    "the propagator for the charged field @xmath27 is given by the @xmath29 limit of the open string propagator .",
    "the string length parameter @xmath32 plays a role analogous to lattice spacing in a lattice - regulated gauge theory .",
    "this string - theoretic cutoff naturally incorporates one of the most striking features of the observed topological charge sheets on the lattice , the fact that the thickness of each sheet and the separation between sheets is determined by the cutoff scale and approaches zero in the continuum limit .",
    "an important issue which has not been adequately addressed in this paper is the question of scaling and universality in a theory whose properties depend so crucially on dynamics that occurs near the cutoff scale .",
    "in particular , the proper scaling behavior of the topological susceptibility is not a foregone conclusion . as an example of what can go wrong ,",
    "the simplest lattice formulation of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 models do not exhibit proper scaling for @xmath12 due to small instantons@xcite , and it is not clear whether the topological susceptibility in these models can be defined as the continuum limit of a lattice calculation .",
    "fortunately , for both @xmath1 with @xmath56 @xcite and for 4-dimensional @xmath0 gauge theory @xcite , small instantons do not contribute , and @xmath12 is found to scale properly .",
    "so at least the numerical evidence indicates that the topological sandwich structure leads to a finite topological susceptibility in the continuum limit and does not cause the same scaling difficulties as small instantons .",
    "it is interesting to note that as the scaling limit is approached the scaling of @xmath12 takes place by virtue of an increasingly precise cancellation in the integrated correlator between the positive contribution at the origin and the negative tail at @xmath166 lattice spacings , with the positive and negative contributions separately diverging in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "since the positive contribution comes from each individual brane , while the negative contribution comes from the juxtaposition of oppositely charged branes , this cancellation is strong evidence that the positions of the layered membranes are highly correlated and arranged in a regular periodic array , as would be expected in the tachyon crystal scenario .",
    "we can conclude from this that the presence of thin membranes of topological charge in the vacuum does indeed pose a threat to proper scaling , just as small instantons do , in the sense that a random distribution of such membranes would lead to a divergent @xmath12 .. it is only through the regular `` antiferromagnetic '' ordering of the membranes that proper scaling is achieved .",
    "the issue of universality ( i.e. whether different cutoffs lead to the same low energy physics ) may be further illuminated in the @xmath1 model by detailed comparison between the string theory cutoff , the lattice cutoff , and the large n approximation with momentum space cutoff .",
    "in fact an apparent discrepency has been pointed out between the lattice formulation and the continuum large @xmath9 approximation associated with the phenomenon of `` superconfinement '' @xcite .",
    "this is the observation that , to all orders in the lattice strong coupling expansion , the net @xmath22 current ( [ eq : u1current ] ) flowing along any link of the lattice must be zero , since the integral over the gauge link vanishes unless there are an equal number of @xmath167 s and @xmath168 s .",
    "this would seem to rule out bulk electric field excitations .",
    "what appears in the large n approximation as a constant electric field , e.g. between spatially separated test charges , when looked at microscopically on the lattice is a chain of polarized @xmath169 pairs .",
    "the large @xmath9 approximation thus gives a somewhat smeared out view of the short - distance lattice dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "lattice monte carlo calculations of @xmath12 converge nicely with increasing n to be in accurate agreement with the large n result at about @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "so the absence of superconfinement in the large @xmath9 approximation does not seem to invalidate its low energy predictions . as discussed in @xcite the smearing of the superconfinement constraint and the appearance of bulk electric fields in the large @xmath9 analysis",
    "can be traced to the introduction of the lagrange multiplier field @xmath26 , which temporarily relaxes the constraint @xmath171 .",
    "this constraint is reimposed upon integrating over the @xmath26 field , but for fixed @xmath26 , superconfinement does not hold .",
    "( note that typically the lagrange multiplier field is not introduced in lattice calculations and the constraint @xmath171 is maintained site by site in the update procedure . )",
    "the large @xmath9 approximation , in which @xmath26 is assumed to be a constant , is not sufficient to restore the superconfinement property .",
    "it is very interesting that the string theoretic cutoff introduced in this paper leads to a @xmath8 field which is rapidly oscillating at the cutoff scale but has the same low energy effect as a constant @xmath26 , i.e. a constant mass shift .",
    "the tachyonic crystal structure for the gauge field which emerges from the string theory seems to be to some extent replicating the short - distance structure seen on the lattice ."
