    "photons are able to probe any or all stages of a relativistic heavy - ion collision@xcite since their mean free paths are much larger than the transverse size of the hot and dense region and will therefore escape after production without rescattering .",
    "massive photons , or dileptons , share this property .",
    "therefore , photons and dileptons are thought to provide exciting means of probing even the central region cleanly@xcite .",
    "observation of quark - gluon plasma through the use of photons is contingent , among other things , on the production rate or ultimately the yield being distinguishable from hadron gas . yet , current understanding is that hadron gas and quark - gluon plasma produce energetic photons nearly equally frequently at fixed temperature @xmath7 mev@xcite . while studying low - mass dilepton spectra after integrating the rates over space - time history the same conclusion was reached : the two phases produced massive photons more or less equally@xcite .",

    "produced photons might be categorized according to their energy as follows . for @xmath9 below 0.5 gev bremsstrahlung from charged particle scattering and decay will be important . also , reactions in which a large mass hadron ( compared to the combined mass of the initial hadrons ) is in the final state such as @xmath10 are endothermic and tend to give large contributions at low photon energies . for higher energies",
    "direct decays give a substantial contribution as does the process @xmath3 .",
    "it has recently been shown that inclusion of the @xmath11 resonance in @xmath3 scattering results in a large rate of photon production , larger than all others combined@xcite .",
    "when interference effects are treated properly the effect of the @xmath11 is changed somewhat but remains important@xcite .",
    "vector meson decays are also important : the @xmath12 has a relatively large decay rate into a neutral pion and photon .",
    "folding in a bose - einstein distribution for the @xmath12 results in a significant thermal production rate  @xcite .",
    "kaon abundances are 23 times smaller than pion s at temperatures near @xmath8 , so they will frequently scatter with pions and with rhos . with the pions , @xmath13(892 )",
    "resonances can be formed and with the rhos , scattering through @xmath2 is probable .",
    "the @xmath14 decay channel of @xmath2 is exceptional in that it is only 71 mev / c center - of - mass momentum above threshold and therefore has a cross section ( proportional to @xmath15 ) which is relatively large .",
    "this resonance has recently been shown to affect kaon mean free paths in hot matter by tens of percents@xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study reactions involving the @xmath16 and their contributions to photon production .",
    "the large family of non - strange and strange mesons will comprise the hot thermalized system . at temperatures near 100 mev or so",
    ", the system will be populated mostly by pions since boltzmann weightings strongly suppress the heavier ones . as the temperature rises to something near @xmath8 ,",
    "the situation can become different since the suppression is effectively weaker .",

    "the @xmath12 might be on shell in which case it just contributes to the equilibrium number of omegas .",
    "it might also be off shell and will subsequently decay ( off shell ) into @xmath27 .",
    "the product of the density times overall decay seems sizeable , so folding in the dynamics , kinematics and thermally distributed phase space could result in a significant thermal production rate .",
    "theoretical framework for photon production rates through radiative decay from a thermalized system will be presented in the next section .",
    "discussion of the model dependence of hadronic and electromagnetic transitions upon their specific interactions will also appear .",

    "bose enhancement(pauli suppression ) is enforced by choosing the @xmath51 sign in the square - bracketed term . identifying the species of hadrons and their interaction with other hadrons into which they might decay , and specifying their interaction with the electromagnetic field completely defines the problem .",
    "what remains is to carry out the necessary four - vector algebra and phase space integration .",
    "the model lagrangians used are the following .",

    "an estimate for coupling the axial - vectors @xmath11 and @xmath16 to the photon field ( and a pion or kaon respectively ) is now needed .",

    "[ fig : three ] . results for @xmath81 and @xmath82 will not be discussed here since they result in smaller rates .",
    "features common to these processes are that they turn over and approach zero for @xmath83 simply due to vanishing phase space in this limit . unlike processes such as @xmath47 ,",
    "these axial - vector _ direct _ decays can not proceed without the photon present .",
    "they peak at slightly different photon energies due to the differences in the axial - vector and decay particle masses .",
    "their slopes also reflect these differences : the @xmath84 shows the largest slope , then the @xmath85 followed by the @xmath86 final state results .",
    "the most startling feature is the overall magnitude of the @xmath35 decay .",
    "for this temperature its peak is seven times larger than the others .",
    "the reason for this is twofold .",
    "first is the relative abundance of @xmath35 , for which there are roughly half as many @xmath35s as there are omegas per unit volume .",
    "this is larger than one would expect , but isospin degeneracy and the high temperature are responsible .",
    "secondly , @xmath35 decays predominantly into a @xmath25 combination , which subsequently decays into @xmath85 . roughly speaking ,",
    "the overall rate for this is @xmath87 which is a factor 18 larger than simple @xmath88 decay . multiplying the density of @xmath35 mesons times the rate from eq .",
    "( [ eq : roughrate ] ) results in a factor 9 more than radiative @xmath12 decay .",
    "when comparing thermal photon production via @xmath89 with the corresponding thermal production rate for @xmath90 presented at @xmath36 = 200 mev in ref.@xcite , this factor of 9 is consistent .",
    "kinematics and bose - einstein distributions complicate matters as does the phase space integration , but the result can be understood with the above simple argument .",
    "one - pion radiative decay of real omegas is not included within the @xmath35 decay ",
    "they really are separate contributions .",
    "imagine @xmath35 being instead very massive .",
    "thermal photon production via @xmath35 decay would apprach zero in the infinite - mass limit simply due to vanishing equilibrium number density @xmath91 .",
    "omega radiative decay , on the other hand , is not affected by such a change and @xmath12 decay must contribute .",
    "summing both processes does not amount to double counting .",
    "radiative decay of @xmath35 turns out to be rather large ( for a limited range in photon energy ) due in part to the abundance .",
    "the natural question to ask therefore , is about its rise with increasing temperature ; or alternatively , its fall with decreasing temperature .",
    "for this reason fig .",
    "[ fig : four ] is shown at three values of temperature 100 , 150 and 200 mev . each result",
    "is superimposed on the rate of photon production from @xmath3 as calculated using an effective chiral lagrangian including effects of the @xmath11 resonance coherently@xcite . as the temperature drops , the photon energy for which the two processes are equal shifts downward .",
    "but the noteworthy feature of dominance of the two - pion radiative decay of @xmath35 for a narrow range of photons energies basically remains even at temperature 100 mev .",
    "the hadron - gas environment is quite different from free space , and one can therefore justifiably question the applicability of the matrix element of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mb1decay ] ) .",
    "in particular , the @xmath12 propagator is just taken to be the free space vector propagator which contains the vacuum width of 8.43 mev and no shift in pole position .",
    "the vacuum width corresponds to a lifetime of 23 fm / c .",
    "yet , the mean free path of an @xmath12 in this hot matter is at most a few fermis since it can scatter with pions to form a @xmath35 resonance@xcite , so it will likely rescatter before decaying . to account for this ,",
    "a collisional broadened width is computed .",
    "roughly it is @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the pion density , @xmath94 is the @xmath25 cross section , and @xmath95 is their relative velocity .",
    "if there are 0.3 pions per @xmath22 , if the cross section is 1 @xmath96 and the relative velocity @xmath97 = 0.5 , an extra _ collisional _ width of 30 mev should be added to the vacuum width .",
    "rather than use this crude estimate , the expression @xmath98 is used , where @xmath99 a breit - wigner form for the cross section @xmath100 is used with @xmath101 being the center - of - mass momentum and the full and partial widths taken to be 155 mev . the collision rate ( or width ) is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : collwidth ] for 100 , 150 and 200 mev temperature . energy dependence aside , it is indeed of order 30 mev .",
    "it is now added to the vacuum width resulting in an energy - dependent full width of @xmath102    the propagator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegaprop ] ) is now modified by replacing the omega width by this energy - dependent full width @xmath103 . integrating over the phase space for the initial and final hadrons as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decayrate ] ) sums over contributions from all kinematically allowed squared four momentum for the omega .",
    "a broader total width in the ( denominator of the ) propagator will naturally reduce the rate for producing photons . in physical terms , the propagating omega from which radiation originates can scatter with the strongly interacting matter and is therefore no longer as free to decay radiatively .",
    "modified rates are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : broadrate ] with those using the vacuum width .",
    "the reduction in photon production is more pronounced at larger temperatures as expected but for temperature 100200 mev , the modified rate is comparable to @xmath3 at its peak .",
    "however , it is no longer significantly larger than the other axial - vector decays considered here .    to more fully appreciate the relative importance of radiative decay fig .",
    "[ fig : last ] is shown . in it ,",
    "the sum of @xmath11 , @xmath35 and @xmath16 decays is compared at @xmath104 mev with the dominant hadronic scattering contributions @xmath3 and @xmath4 as well as the decay @xmath47 taken from ref .",
    "the @xmath35 results are those from fig .",
    "[ fig : broadrate ] which include a collisional broadened width for the omega .",
    "radiative decays contribute more than scattering for photon energies 0.40.75 gev .",
    "then for more energetic photons they are less important . if one is merely concerned with the overall order of magnitude of the photon energy spectrum , these are clearly not so important . at some level in more detailed analyses of the energy spectrum",
    ", these axial - vector radiative decays do become important .",
    "mechanisms for photon production in hot hadronic matter are numerous .",
    "most of them involve species whose abundances are too low or whose scattering rates or decay rates are too small to compete with pion and rho meson processes .",
    "there are some with abundances and relevant rates that do in fact compete for limited range in photon energies . namely , radiative decay of the heavier axial - vector mesons @xmath11 , @xmath35 and @xmath16 are relatively important .",
    "contributions from @xmath79 and @xmath105 are comparable to @xmath106 with similar photon energy dependence .",
    "contribution of @xmath34 is as large as @xmath3 near its peak which occurs at photon energy 0.5 gev .",
    "however , for photon energies 0.4 gev and less , other processes like @xmath4 and @xmath47 become dominant@xcite .",
    "other heavy mesons do not contribute as strongly as the three axial - vector radiative decays mentioned above .",
    "the @xmath107 and @xmath14 decay channels of @xmath11 and @xmath16 are very strong which result in rather large coupling constants . by vector - meson dominance ,",
    "the electromagnetic - decay coupling constants are also relatively large .",
    "similar remarks can be made about the @xmath35 , but in addition it is also exceptional since one of its most likely decay products is @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath12 s electromagnetic decay rate is rather large  a partial width of 0.7 mev .",
    "other non - strange and strange heavy mesons which decay to omega do so with much smaller rates and furthermore , will not be nearly so abundant at temperatures 100200 mev .",
    "thermalization is assumed for all hadronic species in this study . for pions and rho mesons",
    "this is quite reasonable but for heavier hadrons it is not so clear .",
    "it may well be that the axial - vectors considered here do not thermalize .",
    "their average dynamics could be different resulting in different photon production .",
    "modification due to such effects would be an interesting pursuit .",
    "the method of collisional broadening included in sec .",
    "[ sec : broadening ] is somewhat simplistic .",
    "one should really compute a finite temperature propagator and self - energy for the omega to two - loop order .",
    "the presence of matter modifies the width by modifying the imaginary part of the self - energy .",
    "it also modifies the pole position of the propagator , i.e. gives the omega an effective mass , by introducing a real part to the self - energy .",
    "such a calculation would have appeal from the point of view of theory that the real and imaginary parts would be computed consistently .",
    "what has been done in the present work represents only a simple , first approximation to the effect .",
    "dilepton production via hadronic decay is limited , of course , to invariant masses for the pair at most equal to the mass of the parent hadron less any final state hadrons .",
    "therefore , higher mass pairs can only come from very massive hadrons .",
    "one might even consider charmed non - strange and strange mesons , but even at these temperatures they would be rarely produced indeed .",
    "on the other hand , for intermediate dilepton invariant masses the results presented here lead naturally to questions about the role of axial vectors , the @xmath35 in particular , on the invariant mass spectrum of lepton pairs .",
