    "there has been much recent interest in the effects of interactions on the localization of electrons in disordered systems @xcite .",
    "following many recent papers , we address this issue for the simplest case of _ two electrons_. recent numerical work @xcite found that interactions help to delocalize the electrons , yielding a metal  insulator transition . instead of discussing a fully random system , we consider a _",
    "dilute _ system with only @xmath0 ( out of @xmath4 ) impurities .",
    "we then discuss the ` static ' eigenstates and scattering situations . in sec .",
    "2 we show that the exact eigenenergies of the two electrons , in a tight binding model with on  site interactions , are found from the eigenvalues of a ( small ) @xmath5 matrix , which involves the solutions of the 1e hamiltonian .",
    "this yields a new calculational scheme , which should be very effective for numerical studies . using this scheme ,",
    "we obtain consequences for _ quantum dots _",
    "@xcite , and our discussion emphasizes the importance of the hybridization of the wave functions with the ` band ' states of the ` leads ' .",
    "quantum dots have potential applications as artificial atomic or molecular devices , and are very instrumental in studying strong correlations and their implications .",
    "much of the discussion in the literature used the coulomb blockade approach @xcite , which asigns a constant repulsive energy for each pair of electrons on the dot .",
    "in contrast , we find that the interacting eigenenergies are bounded between consecutive non  interacting two  electron ( 2e ) energies , so that the energy cost due to the interactions is usually much smaller than the average on  site repulsion @xmath6 .    in sec .",
    "3 we apply our scheme to specific models of quantum dots .",
    "a single quantum dot coupled to electrodes is modeled by one impurity ( @xmath3 ) on a one dimensional ( 1d ) , @xmath4site chain @xcite .",
    "this represents a special case of the anderson model @xcite , with a specific momentum ",
    "dependent hybridization between the impurity and the conductance band .",
    "we find that the behavior of the two electrons on the  dot \" has a rich phase diagram , as function of the  dot \" site energy @xmath7 and the hybridization .",
    "these parameters can be tuned experimentally , by varying the voltage on a gate coupled capacitively to the dot and the barriers between the dot and the leads @xcite .",
    "we also find a delocalization transition at large @xmath8 , for sufficiently negative @xmath7 , giving an analytic demonstration of the metal ",
    "insulator transition mentioned above .",
    "more complex examples include a cluster of @xmath0 impurities coupled to 1d leads , representing one large dot @xcite , two separate impurities , representing double quantum dots ( or artificial  molecules \" ) @xcite , etc .",
    "section 4 generalized the above discussion to scattering situations .",
    "for a simple model , with @xmath3 , we find a large enhancement of the transmission by the interactions , reflecting again delocalization by interaction .",
    "we find peaks in the transmission ( or in the conductance ) as function of the gate voltage on the dot .",
    "these peaks have nothing to do with those discussed in the coulomb blockade literature .",
    "we start with the 1e tight binding hamiltonian @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a ( spin  independent ) state localized on site @xmath11 , the first sum runs over all the site pairs in the system ( including the impurities ) and the second sum runs over the @xmath0 impurities .",
    "we first find the 1e eigenstates @xmath12 and eigenenergies @xmath13 of @xmath14 .",
    "for the interactions , we consider only _ on  site repulsive interactions _ , @xmath15 .",
    "this interaction has no effect on the _ triplet _ states , which vanish when both electrons are on the same impurity .",
    "therefore , we discuss only _ singlet _ eigenstates , @xmath16 , with electrons at sites @xmath11 and @xmath17 .    rewriting the eigenvalue equation @xmath18 in the form @xmath19 , with @xmath20",
    ", we can now easily obtain the equations @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the non  interacting 2e green s function in which the two electrons are on the same site , cf .",
    "the new eigenvalues are thus found by requiring that the @xmath5 determinant @xmath24 vanishes . finding the @xmath0 eigenvalues @xmath25 of the matrix @xmath26 , the new ( @xmath27dependent ) exact eigenenergies @xmath28 solve the equations @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath30 s are then given by the eigenvectors related to @xmath25 , and @xmath31 .",
    "using the non  interacting singlet basis , @xmath32/2^{(1+\\delta_{ab})/2}$ ] , with eigenenergies @xmath33 and @xmath34 , one has @xmath35 since each @xmath36 has poles at every @xmath37 , each @xmath38 will generally also have such poles . ignoring special symmetric cases , when the residues of some of these poles vanish , one has @xmath39 when @xmath40 . in this approximation , @xmath41 $ ] , with @xmath42 .",
    "as @xmath43 crosses @xmath37 , @xmath44 jumps from @xmath45 to @xmath46 . as @xmath43 increases between two consecutive non  interacting eigenvalues , @xmath44 varies smoothly from @xmath46 to @xmath45 .",
    "thus , @xmath47 must have at least one ( and up to @xmath0 ) solution(s ) between every pair of such consecutive energies , and the new energies maintain the sequence of the non  interacting ones .",
    "for example , the cost of adding two electrons into the ground state , @xmath48 , is thus bounded by the 1e distance to the first excited level , @xmath49 , which may be much smaller than the coulomb blockade value @xmath6 !",
    "it is interesting to note that small ( and not evenly spaced ) values of @xmath50 were observed in a series of 2d quantum dots @xcite , apparently contradicting the simple coulomb blockade picture .",
    "it is tempting to relate these observations to our result .",
    "the simplest example concerns one impurity ( or  dot \" ) on a 1d wire , closed with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we place the impurity at site @xmath51 , with energy @xmath7 and with real matrix elements @xmath52 .",
    "the other nearest neighbor matrix elements are set at @xmath53 , for @xmath54 .",
    "the 1e spectrum contains @xmath55 odd eigenstates , @xmath56 , which are not affected by the impurity , and @xmath55 even ones , whose energies are shifted .",
    "these even solutions exhibit a rich phase diagram in terms of @xmath7 ( in units of @xmath57 ) and @xmath58 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] @xcite : in region a all the states are delocalized , with almost unshifted energies , in the ` conduction band ' . in region c ( or d+f )",
    "there exists one bound state above ( or below ) the conduction band .",
    "finally , both bound states exist in region b. an important detail concerns the normalization : except for the trivial case when @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the amplitude of the ` band ' state @xmath61 is found to be proportional to @xmath62 , vanishing at the band edges .",
    "this will turn out to be crucial below .    for @xmath3 , adding the interaction @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "indeed , @xmath65 jumps from @xmath45 to @xmath46 as @xmath43 crosses each non  interacting energy @xmath37 , and we find one new eigenvalue between every pair of non  interacting energies , as described above . in regions b , d and f , the non  interacting ground state has two bound electrons , with energy @xmath66 , and the new ground state energy is always bound between this energy and that of one bound and one ` free ' electron , @xmath67 . for finite @xmath4 , @xmath68 would diverge towards @xmath45 as @xmath69 is approached , implying a persistent doubly bound solution below the band for all @xmath8 .",
    "however , when @xmath70 we replace the sums over the band states by integrals .",
    "since @xmath61 vanishes at @xmath69 , @xmath71 remains _ finite_. in region",
    "d one has @xmath72 , so that @xmath47 has a discrete doubly bound state for all @xmath8 .",
    "however , in region f one has @xmath73 , implying a disappearance of this bound state for @xmath74 ; the ground state energy is now at the bottom of the band , implying an ` ionization ' of one electron and an ` insulator to metal ' transition from d to f. this transition occurs at a lower value of @xmath8 for larger negative values of @xmath7 , when the localization length of the bound electrons is smaller , and they feel the interaction more strongly .",
    "it should be noted that although the bound state is a singlet , with total spin zero , the new ground state in region f has one bound electron and one  free \" electron .",
    "such a state does not feel the e ",
    "e repulsion , and is thus practically degenerate with the slightly lower triplet state ( for large @xmath4 , the difference is of order @xmath75 ) . unlike the  insulator \" singlet ( or  antiferromagnetic \" ) ground state , which has no net magnetic moment , this  metallic \" state in region f is _",
    "paramagnetic_. this difference should be measurable in an external magnetic field .",
    "our model also exhibits interesting finite size effects for @xmath76 , and interesting antibound 2e excitations above the band @xcite .",
    "the analysis is somewhat more complicated for @xmath77 , where the @xmath78 matrix @xmath26 has symmetric and antisymmetric eigenvalues , corresponding to products of even  even ( and odd  odd ) and of even ",
    "odd 1e states , respectively .",
    "the resulting phase diagram now also depends on the inter ",
    "impurity distance @xmath79 , and the region equivalent to f in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shrinks to a small ` bubble ' @xcite .",
    "so far we emphasized only the ground state , for a problem with periodic boundary conditions . in real ` quantum dot ' experiments one is more interested in _ scattering _ situations , when electrons are sent from one side and one calculates the _ current _ or the _ transmission _ through the dot .",
    "for the simplest exact calculation of the transmission for two interacting electrons , we replace the above tight binding hamiltonian by its continuum limit , @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the coordinate and the spin component of the @xmath11th electron , and @xmath83 is the single  particle hamiltonian , independent of the spin components .",
    "again , we consider only the singlet spatially _ symmetric _ wave functions , @xmath84 . at total energy @xmath43 , we split @xmath85 into @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the solution of @xmath88 , with the same energy @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 ) , @xmath91 .",
    "for the on  site interaction ( [ h ] ) it then follows that @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the two  particle green s function of the _ interacting hamiltonian_.    for the model hamiltonian given by ( [ h ] ) one can express the green s function of the interacting system , @xmath93 , in terms of @xmath94 , discussed in the previous section .",
    "the definitions of these two green s functions yield the bethe  salpeter equation @xmath95 and hence @xmath96 $ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath99 is determined solely by the non  interacting hamiltonian @xmath100 .",
    "we next calculate the quantum average of the current density operator at @xmath101 , in the exact singlet state @xmath85 , @xmath102 the explicit calculation of @xmath17 now requires only integrals involving the non  interacting functions @xmath103 and non  interacting states @xmath104 . in what follows",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath105 is given by the singlet combination @xmath106 , as defined in the previous section , and that the total energy is given by @xmath107 .",
    "to proceed , we choose a simple @xmath108function attractive potential , @xmath109 which has one bound state , @xmath110 with the inverse localization length @xmath111 , with eigenenergy @xmath112 , and  band \" scattering wavefunctions @xmath113 , with the reflection and transmission amplitudes @xmath114 , and with eigenenergy @xmath115 .",
    "there are two physical situations which are of interest for the non  interacting wave function @xmath106 .",
    "the first corresponds to two _ propagating _ electrons , impinging from the left , when both @xmath116 and @xmath117 represent  band \" states . in this case , the current density of a ` macroscopic ' system ( that is , for @xmath118 ) is _ unaffected _ by the interaction @xmath8 , and remains as in the non  interacting system , @xmath119 .",
    "the second , more interesting , choice for @xmath106 arises when one electron is propagating , with @xmath120 representing its wave vector , and the other is captured in the bound state , i. e. @xmath121 .",
    "now the total energy is @xmath122 . in this case , the terms coming from the interaction are of the same order as the non  interacting ones .",
    "a long but straightforward calculation now yields @xmath123 , where the effective transmission is @xmath124 . remembering that @xmath125 $ ] , the new term in @xmath2 will have a ` resonance ' when @xmath126 .",
    "this equation is similar to the equation @xmath127 encountered in the previous section .    for an explicit calculation of @xmath128",
    ", we introduce an upper cutoff @xmath129 on the  band \" states .",
    "we then found that @xmath130 for small @xmath131 , and @xmath132 for large @xmath131 . in the former region",
    "there is no ` resonance ' . in the latter region",
    "there can be a resonance for sufficiently large @xmath8 .",
    "this yields a very interesting dependence of the effective transmission @xmath2 on the single  electron parameters and on @xmath8 .",
    "specifically , fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] shows the dependence of @xmath133 on @xmath131 , for a finite value of @xmath8 and for two values of @xmath120 .",
    "clearly , @xmath133 increases significantly as the result of the interaction , reflecting _",
    "delocalization due to the interaction_. at @xmath134 one has @xmath135 , independent of @xmath8 . at small @xmath131 , @xmath2 always decreases , due to scattering by the single electron potential , following the non  interacting case . however , @xmath8 effectively screens this attractive potential , and at small @xmath120 this results in a double peak structure of @xmath2 , as shown in the figure .",
    "qualitatively , these peaks arise when the screening cancels the attractive potential . at larger @xmath120",
    "the minimum between the peaks grows , the two peaks join into a relatively broad plateau which decays at large @xmath120 .",
