    "_ de sitter _ spacetime is the paradigmatic and , in many ways , the simplest accelerating universe .",
    "it is a maximally symmetric solution of einstein s equations with a positive cosmological constant , describing a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology with a constant hubble parameter .",
    "moreover , the large scale structure of our universe appears to be that of a de sitter geometry , since the large body of observational evidence for a present cosmological acceleration is well modeled by a positive cosmological constant @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "key questions concerning the evolution towards a de sitter , spatially homogeneous universe are how inhomogeneities develop in time and , in particular , if they are washed away by the cosmological expansion @xcite . answering them , requires controlling the imprint of the gravitational interaction between localized objects on the large - scale expansion .",
    "conversely , the cosmological dynamics should leave imprints in strong gravitational phenomena like primordial black hole ( bh ) formation @xcite or the gravitational radiation emitted in a bh binary coalescence , which carry signatures of the cosmological acceleration as it travels across the universe .",
    "identifying these signatures is not only of conceptual interest but also phenomenologically relevant , in view of the ongoing efforts to directly detect gravitational radiation .",
    "finally , dynamics in asymptotically de sitter spacetimes could also teach us about more fundamental questions such as cosmic censorship : two bhs of sufficiently large mass in de sitter spacetime would , upon merger , give rise to too large a bh to fit in its cosmological horizon . in this case the end state would be a naked singularity .",
    "this possibility begs for a time evolution of such a configuration .",
    "does the time evolution of non - singular data containing two bhs result in a naked singularity , or are potentially offending bhs simply driven away from each other by the cosmological expansion ?    tackling all these issues starts with the study of the coalescence process in bh binaries . since 2005",
    "@xcite , extraordinary progress has been achieved in the understanding of bh mergers and the associated gravitational radiation emission , using numerical methods , while the last few years have witnessed a generalized interest in the program of extending numerical evolution of bh spacetimes to generic backgrounds @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall take the first step to bring these techniques to a new frontier : we report the first numerical evolution of bh binaries in an asymptotically de sitter geometry .",
    "even though we consider a range of values for the cosmological constant far larger than those which are phenomenologically viable , these results provide useful insight on the general features of dynamical bh processes in spacetimes with a cosmological constant , which can improve our understanding of our universe .",
    "the schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime , written in static coordinates reads : @xmath1 the solution is characterized by two parameters ; the bh mass @xmath2 and the hubble parameter @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath5 has two zeros , at @xmath6 , @xmath7 , if @xmath8 these zeros are the location of the bh event horizon ( @xmath9 ) and of a cosmological horizon ( @xmath10 ) . if @xmath11 , then @xmath12 ; if @xmath13 , then @xmath14 . if @xmath15 , then @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath18 is the areal radius , the area of the spatial sections of the cosmological horizon decreases in the presence of a bh ; and the area of the spatial sections of the bh horizon increases in the presence of a cosmological constant , as one would intuitively anticipate .",
    "the basic dynamics in this spacetime may be inferred by looking at radial time - like geodesics .",
    "they obey the equations @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the proper time and @xmath21 is the conserved quantity associated to the killing vector field @xmath22 . in the static patch ( @xmath23 )",
    ", @xmath21 can be regarded as energy . from this equation",
    "we see that @xmath5 is an effective potential .",
    "this potential has a maximum at r_max=(m / h^2)^1/3 [ eq : rcrit_geo ] .",
    "geodesics starting from rest ( _ i.e. _ @xmath24 ) will fall into the bh if @xmath25 or move away from the bh if @xmath26 .    as we will discuss in the next section , the initial data for an evolution in the de sitter universe can be computed in a similar manner as has been done in asymptotically flat space as long as one chooses a foliation with extrinsic curvature @xmath27 having only a trace part .",
    "such a coordinate system is known for schwarzschild - de sitter : _ mcvittie coordinates _ @xcite .",
    "these are obtained from static coordinates by the transformation @xmath28 given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "one obtains mcvittie s form for schwarzschild - de sitter : @xmath32 for @xmath33 , one can show that indeed @xmath34 .    by setting @xmath13 in mcvittie",
    "coordinates one recovers a frw cosmological model with @xmath35 ( flat spatial curvature ) and an exponentially growing scale factor .",
    "the cosmological horizon @xmath36 discussed above , located at @xmath37 , stands at @xmath38 .",
    "the spatial sections of @xmath36 seem to be shrinking down in this coordinate system .",
    "what happens , in fact , is that the exponentially fast expansion is taking any observer to the outside of @xmath36 .",
    "this is a well known phenomenon in studies of inflation and , as we shall see , has important consequences for the numerical evolution .",
    "the cosmological constant introduces a new term in the hamiltonian constraint obtained after the canonical 3 + 1 decomposition : @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes the ricci scalar associated with the spatial three metric and @xmath27 , @xmath41 the extrinsic curvature and its trace ; cf .  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was observed that imposing a spacetime slicing obeying @xmath34 , and a spatial metric of the form @xmath42 , the equations to be solved in order to obtain initial data are equivalent to those in vacuum . in particular , for a system of @xmath43 bhs momentarily at rest ( with respect to the given spatial coordinate patch ) , the conformal factor @xmath44 takes the form @xmath45 there are @xmath46 asymptotically de sitter regions , as @xmath47 ; the total mass for observers in the common asymptotic region ( @xmath48 ) is @xmath49  @xcite .    for the numerical implementation we make use of the generalized baumgarte , shapiro , shibata and nakamura ( bssn ) formulation , _",
    "e.g. _  @xcite . for the case of vanishing cosmological constant the definition of the bssn variables @xmath50 and their evolution in time",
    "is given by eqs .",
    "( 1 , a1-a8 ) in ref .",

    "( a6 ) in @xcite .",
    "( ii ) a new variable @xmath54 has been evolved instead of @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that for bh evolutions it is crucial to impose a floor value on @xmath55 , typically @xmath56 or @xmath57 , which is inconsistent with the natural behaviour of this variable in a de sitter spacetime : @xmath58 .",
    "in contrast @xmath59 when @xmath60 for all times .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 and replaces eq .",
    "( a6 ) of @xcite .",
    "boundary conditions for all quantities are imposed by looking at the behavior of massless perturbing fields in a pure de sitter background .",
    "accordingly , we impose the following asymptotic behavior for all bssn variables @xmath63 we should note that we also performed evolutions using different sets of boundary conditions , to test the independence of the results on boundary conditions imposed in a region with no causal contact with the interaction region . as far as the behaviour and location of the horizons and all quantities discussed in this paper",
    "are concerned , no noticeable difference could be found .",
    "our numerical simulations use the lean code @xcite which is based on the cactus computational toolkit  @xcite and the carpet mesh refinement package @xcite .",
    "the calculation of black hole apparent horizons ( bahs ) and cosmological apparent horizons ( cahs ) is performed with ahfinderdirect @xcite .",
    "we remark that bahs , found as marginally trapped surfaces , indicate in the sitter space ( with the same legitimacy as in asymptotically flat space ) the existence of an event horizon @xcite .",
    "cahs are surfaces of zero expansion for _ ingoing _ null geodesics . in a single bh case , in mcvittie coordinates , the bh event horizon and cosmological horizon",
    "are indeed foliated by apparent horizons .",
    "the `` expanding '' behaviour of the coordinate system led us to add a new innermost refinement level at periodic time intervals so as to keep the number of points inside the cosmological horizon approximately unchanged .",
    "the necessity for adding extra refinement levels effectively limits our ability to follow the evolution on very long timescales , as the number of time steps to cover a fixed portion of physical time grows exponentially .",
    "this feature resembles in many ways the recently reported work by pretorius and lehner on the follow - up of the black string instability @xcite .",
    "for a single bh evolution with @xmath64 using the mcvittie slicing condition , eq . .",
    "the obtained numerical results are plotted , along the @xmath65 coordinate ( symmetry @xmath66 imposed at @xmath67 ) , against the expected analytical solutions ( solid lines ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as a first test on the numerical implementation , we performed evolutions of a single bh imposing the mcvittie slicing condition ; that is , we use   as initial data and impose @xmath68 throughout the evolution .",
    "the analytical solution can be compared with the numerical results . for a single bh evolution with @xmath69 and @xmath64 ,",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcvittie ] . using this slicing ,",
    "the runs eventually crash ( at @xmath70 ) .",
    "by contrast , the standard `` 1+log '' slicing condition @xmath71 where @xmath72 , enables us to have long term stable evolutions .",
    "as consistency checks , the areal radii at the apparent horizons ( both bh horizon and cosmological horizon ) are constants in time and have the value expected from the analytical solution in a single bh spacetime .",
    "moreover , the areal radius at fixed coordinate radius evolves with time in the way expected from the exact solution .    for binary bh initial data , we start by reproducing the results of nakao _ et .",
    "@xcite , where the critical distance between two bhs for the existence of a common bah already at @xmath73 was studied .",
    "we thus prepare initial data with @xmath74 and take all quantities in units of the total mass @xmath75 .",

    ", a schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime with the same @xmath3 has @xmath92 and @xmath91 .",
    "this suggests that the interaction effects ( binding energy and emission of gravitational radiation ) are of the order of a few per cent for this configuration .",
    "as the initial separation grows , so does the total time for merger . for separations larger than a critical value , the two bhs do not merge , but scatter to infinity . for such scattering configurations ,",
    "the simulations eventually exhibit a regime of exponentially increasing proper distance between the bah . just as in scatters of high energy bhs @xcite , here we find that the immediate merger / scatter regimes are separated by a blurred region , where the holes sit at an almost fixed proper distance for some time ; cf .",

[ fig : crit_sep_p0 ] is barely distinguishable from the numerical results .    a further interesting feature concerns the approach to the critical line . for an initially static binary close to the critical initial separation ,",
    "the coordinate distance @xmath93 scales as @xmath98 . in general the acceleration parameter scales as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 in the geodesic approximation .",
    "a fit to our numerical results for @xmath80 ( dashed curve in the inset of fig .  [ fig : crit_sep_p0 ] ) for example yields @xmath101 in rough agreement with this expectation .",

    ", such evolutions can test the cosmic censorship conjecture since the observation of a merger in such case would reveal a violation of the conjecture  @xcite . from general arguments and from the simulations with @xmath77 , we know the cosmological repulsion will dominate for sufficiently large initial distance and in that case we can even expect that a cah for the observer at @xmath67 will not encompass the bahs .",
    "this indicates the bhs are no longer in causal contact and therefore can never merge .",
    "our numerical results confirm this overall picture . to test the potentially dangerous configurations , we focus on the regime in which the bhs are initially very close .",

    "[ horizon_shape ] , for a supercritical cosmological constant @xmath102 , and an initial coordinate distance @xmath103 . even though the initial separation is very small , we find that the holes move _ away _ from each other , with a proper separation increasing as the simulation progresses .",

    "the evolution therefore indicates that the spacetime becomes , to an excellent approximation , empty de sitter space for the observer at @xmath67 and that the bhs are not in causal contact .",
    "observe that qualitatively similar evolutions can be found in small mass binaries when the initial distance is larger than the critical value",
    "we have presented evidence that the numerical evolution of bh spacetimes in de sitter universes is under control .",
    "our results open the door to new studies of strong field gravity in cosmologically interesting scenarios . in closing",
    ", we would like to mention that our results are compatible with cosmic censorship in cosmological backgrounds .",
