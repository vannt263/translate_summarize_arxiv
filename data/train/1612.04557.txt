    "we investigate a polling model in the sense of  @xcite consisting of @xmath0 stations which are served by one server .",
    "the stations are labelled by the indices from  @xmath1 to  @xmath2 and served in ascending , cyclic order .",
    "each station  @xmath3 has its own queue which is fed by messages generated by a poisson arrival process with intensity @xmath4 .",
    "each message has a random length ( also called service time ) .",
    "the mean and second moment of the message length distribution are assumed to be finite and denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "switching between stations takes a non - negative random idle time , called switchover time , where the server does not serve any messages at any station .",
    "the random switchover time  @xmath7 from station  @xmath3 to the next station ( with distribution function  @xmath8 ) is assumed to have finite mean  @xmath9 and finite second moment  @xmath10 .",
    "we consider both non - deterministic and deterministic switchover times ( in the latter case @xmath11 for @xmath12 ) .",
    "the sum of the mean switchover times is denoted by @xmath13 and the second moment of the sum of all switchover times by @xmath14 .",
    "the message generation process , the lengths of the messages , and the switchover times are assumed to be independent ( everything among each other and with respect to the other processes and stations ) .    the goal is to obtain explicit formulas for the mean average queueing delay of a message in a polling model with a given wait - and - see strategy in steady state .",
    "the delay is the time a message experiences from the point in time when it arrives in one of the queues until its service starts , i.e. , excluding the service time .",
    "the expected delay of a message generated at station  @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "the mean average queueing delay is then defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the traffic load at station  @xmath3 and @xmath18 is the total load offered to the system .",
    "we stress that the delays of the different stations are weighted by the traffic intensity @xmath19 , which implicitly includes weighting by the mean message lengths , whereas the delays @xmath15 do not include weighting the delay of the individual messages with their lengths . the mean average queueing delay , which we often just abbreviate as _ delay _ ,",
    "is called _ intensity weighted mean waiting time _ by takagi  @xcite .",
    "first , we describe the behaviour of the server in general : the server arrives at a station and starts serving in an exhaustive fashion , i.e. , serving all waiting messages and newly arriving messages ( first come , first served ) until the queue is empty .",
    "however , once the station is empty or if the server finds an empty station upon its arrival , the server may not immediately switch to the next station ; it rather turns idle for some time in order to wait for possibly newly arriving messages ( ` wait - and - see ' ) .",
    "as soon as a new message arrives , the server starts serving immediately and in an exhaustive fashion .",
    "once finished , the server may again turn idle and wait for new messages .    for each of the four strategies considered here ,",
    "the behaviour of the server at station  @xmath3 is governed by a fixed , real parameter  @xmath20 which has different interpretations ( see below ) .",
    "of course , the server is not allowed to be idle if at its present station messages are waiting to be served .",
    "the reason for waiting depends only on the current station in the current cycle , i.e. , on the evolution of the traffic at the present station since the server arrived there .",
    "the server must not use any information about the current queue status at other stations nor about the future of the arrival process at any station .",
    "if @xmath21 holds , the service discipline is exhaustive at station  @xmath3 and there is no state of ` wait - and - see ' at station  @xmath3 . if this is the case for all stations , we call it the _ exhaustive strategy_.    now , we specify the four different wait - and - see strategies .",
    "strategy  i is extensively analysed by aurzada et al .",
    "@xcite and strategy  iv is examined by boxma et al .",
    "@xcite for @xmath22 stations and @xmath23 .",
    "as far as we know , there are no results in the literature on strategy  ii and  iii .",
    "* under * strategy  i * , the server has to wait idly the total time @xmath24 for new messages at station  @xmath3 per cycle .",
    "depending on the arrival process , this credit @xmath24 is spent altogether in one single period or in some periods interleaved by different busy periods . * * strategy  ii * is defined as follows : the server has to stay at least the minimum sojourn time @xmath24 at station  @xmath3 per cycle .",
    "we can regard it as a timer starting upon arrival of the server at this station .",
    "once the server has spent the minimum sojourn time at the station ( possibly consisting of several busy and waiting periods ) , the server exits the station if the queue is empty .",
    "however , if there are still messages waiting or in service as the timer runs out , the server continues serving in an exhaustive fashion and switches to the next station as soon as the queue is empty .",
    "* * strategy  iii * is a modification of the previous one . here , the server is forced to stay at least the fixed time @xmath24 at station  @xmath3 after becoming idle for the first time at this station in this cycle .",
    "if there are no messages waiting upon arrival of the server , the timer starts immediately as in the case for strategy  ii .",
    "otherwise , the timer starts running just after the first busy period . *",
    "* strategy  iv * is also similar to strategy  ii .",
    "however , the timer is only activated if the server finds station  @xmath3 empty upon arrival . in this case , the server remains dormant for at most the time @xmath24 , waiting for the first arriving message .",
    "if the timer expires before the first arrival occurs , the server switches to the next station . on the other hand ,",
    "if a new message arrives before the timer expires , the server starts serving immediately and in an exhaustive fashion .",
    "after this busy period , the server does not wait any longer at this station in the current cycle and switches to the next station .",
    "we stress that we only deal with strategies where the wait - and - see timers are deterministic . in order to yield a lower minimal delay",
    ", we conjecture that deterministic timers do a better job than random timers .",
    "simulations have indicated that such an additional randomness ( of the timer ) in the polling model has no positive effect on the minimal delay .",
    "the results of this paper are as follows :    * we give a formula for the mean average queueing delay in a polling model with @xmath2 stations and strategy  iii ( theorem  [ thm : main ] ) .",
    "* we prove a formula for the mean average queueing delay in a polling model with @xmath22 stations and strategy  ii ( theorem  [ thm : main_2 ] ) .",
    "* we extend  @xcite to timers at _ both _ stations and give a formula for the mean average queueing delay for strategy  iv ( theorem  [ thm : main_2 ] ) .",

    "they characterise several cases where strategy  i yields a lower delay compared to the exhaustive strategy . in these cases ,",
    "the optimal parameters @xmath24 can be computed explicitly .",
    "finally , they give a lower bound for the delay for a class of wait - and - see strategies which includes strategy  .",
    "in  @xcite , boxma et al .",
    "focus on a two - queue polling model with a timer as in strategy  iv at station  @xmath1 which may be random .",
    "they examine different configurations : either both stations are served exhaustively , or one station is controlled by the @xmath1-limited protocol whereas the other station is served in an exhaustive fashion .",
    "the main results are the probability generating function of the queue lengths , expressions for pseudo - conservation laws , and the laplace transform of the stationary waiting times .    besides the main references  @xcite and  @xcite",
    ", further papers deal with service strategies which have in common that the server does not necessarily switch to the next station when the current queue is empty .",
    "polling models with deterministic sojourn times and preemptive service are considered in  @xcite and with exponentially distributed sojourn times in  @xcite .",
    "similar to strategy  iv , in the setting of  @xcite the server waits exactly for the first arriving message at an empty station . in  @xcite , forced idle times are examined where the server is not allowed to resume service immediately as soon as a new message arrives during these idle periods .",
    "furthermore , there are several works that investigate polling models with time - limited service .",
    "there , messages are served at a station for a certain period of time or until the queue is empty , whichever occurs first .",
    "if there is still work at the station when the timer expires , the server either finishes all the present work , or completes only the service of the currently served message , or stops working immediately at this station and switches to the next station .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for random time limits ( in particular exponentially distributed timers ) . in  @xcite and  @xcite ,",
    "deterministic time limits are studied .",
    "in this section , we give formulas for the the mean average queueing delay and characterise the cases for the wait - and - see strategies where it is favourable ( in the sense of a lower delay ) to possibly wait at a station instead of switching . from now on",

    "@xcite for the delay of a message in a polling model with strategy  i. for strategy  ii and  iv , we restrict the number of stations to @xmath22 due to the technical effort that would be required otherwise to compute further parameter - dependent quantities which would arise in the formula for the delay .

    "however , we emphasise that for strategy  ii and  iii we are only able to compute the quantity  @xmath33 explicitly for exponentially distributed service times because formula   below is only available for the m / m/1 queue in the literature , for instance .",
    "the computation is specified in section  [ subsec : deter ] .    .",
    "]    figure  [ fig : delay_all ] provides a typical relation between the delays for all four wait - and - see strategies .",
    "we consider a polling model with @xmath22 stations where the server is not allowed to wait at station  @xmath34 .",
    "the switchover times are deterministic , symmetrically split among the switchovers and the service times are exponentially distributed . the delay for strategy",
    "i was obtained by the formula from  @xcite , and we used theorem  [ thm : main_2 ] and the value for @xmath35 from section  [ subsec : deter ] to compute the data for strategy  .",
    "the ranking of the wait - and - see strategies with respect to the minimal delay observed in figure  [ fig : delay_all ] can be explained naturally : in the best case , the server exits the current station as soon as there is enough work waiting at the other station . since the server does not have any information about the queue status at the other station , the sojourn time at the current station is the crucial quantity in order to estimate the workload generated at the other station .",
    "hence , there is an optimal sojourn time for each station , and the minimal delay is attained if the expected sojourn time agrees with the optimal sojourn time best with a small variance .",
    "therefore , we conjecture that strategy  iii always yields a lower minimal delay compared to strategy  i and that strategy  ii is the best of the investigated wait - and - see strategies .",
    "theorem  [ thm : main_2 ] allows us to put the following question : given the system parameters , how does one have to adjust the parameters @xmath36 such that the delay is minimised . we can not compute a minimiser of this problem @xmath37 for strategy   analytically",
    "nevertheless , we do obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for these wait - and - see strategies in a polling model with exponentially distributed service times such that it is favourable to wait in comparison to the exhaustive strategy . as a summary one can say that the benefit of waiting arises from the asymmetry of the system or from non - deterministic switchover times .",
    "we say that ` it is worth waiting ( at station @xmath3 ) ' if there is a @xmath38 such that the delay is lower than for the exhaustive strategy , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "note that we only consider the two cases with the additional restriction @xmath23 and @xmath40 , respectively .",

    "we observe that for a sufficiently large relative variance of the sum of the switchover times @xmath46 it is even worth waiting at station  @xmath1 in spite of a lower traffic load @xmath47 . as a consequence of this ,",
    "it is favourable to have _ positive _ parameters @xmath24 at both stations instead of just allowing ` wait - and - see ' at the station with higher traffic load .",
    "similar to above , we get necessary and sufficient conditions for a symmetric polling model with @xmath48 such that it is worth waiting with the restriction @xmath40 .",
    "the arrival rates , message length and switchover time distributions are also assumed to be the same for both stations for strategy  ii and  iv but we can omit this requirement for strategy  iii .",

    "we give a direct consequence of the two preceding theorems :    [ cor : conseq ] there are parameter settings of a polling model with @xmath22 stations where strategy  ii and  iv yield a lower delay than strategy  i and  iii , i.e. , it is only worth waiting with strategy  ii and  iv .",
    "we show how to derive theorems  [ thm : main ] and  [ thm : main_2 ] which are based on a decomposition principle from  @xcite and on the technique of the proofs of theorems  @xmath1 and  @xmath50 from  @xcite .",
    "we mention that the proofs of theorems  [ thm : main ] and  [ thm : main_2 ] are quite standard and that the key novelty is the computation of the parameter - dependent quantities in section  [ subsec : deter ] .",
    "first , we recall some important identities : the cycle time is the time that the server takes from its arrival at station  @xmath1 to the next arrival at this station . the mean cycle time in steady state is denoted by  @xmath51 and is given by @xmath52 indeed , this can be argued by looking at the expected time which the server is idle per cycle .",

    ", we can represent this expected idle time using the total load offered to the system which leads to  @xmath54 .",
    "next , we refer to the workload decomposition in  @xcite and  @xcite . as a consequence of this decomposition principle",
    ", we obtain @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the workload at a random point in time in steady state .",
    "the workload consists of the sum of all message lengths that are present in the system including the remaining service time of the currently served message .",
    "the quantities @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) refer to the workload in the same polling model without switchover and waiting times , and to the workload given that the server is switching ( waiting ) at a random point in time , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we can determine the expected workload differently by @xmath61 + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\rho_{i}\\frac{b_{i}^{(2)}}{2b_{i}},\\ ] ] where the quotient is the expected residual service time of a currently served message at station  @xmath3 . using little s law ,",
    "this equation can be rearranged into @xmath62 therefore , we can combine   and   in order to obtain a representation of the delay @xmath63 .",
    "the quantity @xmath64 is given in the literature , e.g. , in  @xcite .    from now on ,",
    "we focus on the expected workload present while switching  @xmath65 and waiting  @xmath66 .",
    "the former does not directly depend on the given wait - and - see strategy so that we can proceed in the same way as in  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the particular wait - and - see strategy influences the expected workload present while waiting .",
    "it remains to give the general formula for @xmath67 , the expected workload that is present in the system at a random point in time when the server is waiting at station  @xmath3 .",
    "following the computation in  @xcite ( see equation @xmath68 there ) , we obtain @xmath69 where @xmath29 denotes the expectation of the elapsed time since arriving at station  @xmath3 at a random point in time while waiting at station  @xmath3 . combining all the relevant equations , we get the formula in theorem  [ thm : main ] for the delay .    for strategy  iii ,",
    "we just obtain the formula from theorem  [ thm : main ] by replacing @xmath2 with @xmath34 .",
    "now , we deal with strategy  ii and  iv in a polling model with @xmath22 stations .",
    "the only part that differs from the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] is the computation of @xmath67 .",
    "we focus on this quantity for @xmath70 .",
    "since the server is currently waiting at station  @xmath1 , the present workload has not been generated at this station .",
    "therefore , the workload which is currently present can only consist of messages that have been generated at station  @xmath34 since exiting that station .",
    "the expectation of the elapsed time is the sum of the mean switchover time from station  @xmath34 to station  @xmath1 and the expected backward recurrence time @xmath71 .",
    "keeping in mind that the server is at a random point in time while waiting , we have to use @xmath72 instead of @xmath73 and get @xmath74 for @xmath75 , we just have to exchange the roles of @xmath1 and @xmath34 .

    "this is due to the fact that non - deterministic switchover times can have an impact on the existence of a waiting period at the next station ( cf .",
