    "the galactic circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) is a weakly - ionized ring of gas and dust which appears in various types of emission at galactocentric radii @xmath0@xmath1pc ( see morris & serabyn 1996 and davidson 1996 for recent reviews ) .",
    "the origin and structure of the cnd magnetic field , , are particularly intriguing : mid- and far - infrared polarimetry ( @xcite ; @xcite ; hildebrand et al .  1990 , 1993 [ h90 , h93 ] ) show that  lies primarily in the plane of the disk and",
    "is roughly orthogonal to the poloidal field observed on larger scales .",
    "werner et al . ( 1988 ) pointed out that a differentially - rotating disk would deform an initially poloidal field into a predominantly toroidal configuration .",
    "subsequently , wardle and  ( 1990 , [ wk ] ) described self - similar hydromagnetic accretion disk models of the cnd ; with the addition of a small nonaxisymmetric distortion , the magnetic field predicted by their preferred model , gc2 , is in reasonable agreement with the field inferred from far - infrared polarimetry ( h93 ) .    in the wk models , the magnetic torques which remove angular momentum from the gas",
    "are mediated by supersonic ambipolar diffusion . coincidentally ,",
    "roberge , hanany , & messinger ( 1995 , [ rhm ] ) showed that ambipolar diffusion causes grain alignment : the partial coupling of charged dust grains to the drifting field lines produces gas - grain streaming , which causes alignment of the grains via gold s mechanism ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; rhm ) .",
    "the large magnitude of the `` intrinsic '' 100  polarization from grains aligned by supersonic ambipolar diffusion ( e.g. , @xmath2% for oblate silicate grains with @xmath3:@xmath4 axis ratios viewed with the most favorable magnetic field geometry ; see rhm ) leads us to conjecture that the ambipolar mechanism is the predominant cause of grain alignment in the cnd . in   23",
    ", we test this conjecture by calculating the polarized thermal emission that would be caused by ambipolar alignment in model gc2 and comparing our results to the 100  polarimetry of h90 and h93 .",
    "the largest optical depth through the cnd is @xmath5 at 100 ; consequently the stokes parameters , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , are well described by the transfer equations for optically thin emission , @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 ( wk90 ) , where @xmath12 is distance along the line of sight . we integrated equations ( [ eq-2_1])([eq-2_3 ] ) to obtain the polarization magnitude , @xmath13 , and position angle if the electric vector is polarized along the east - west direction .",
    "] , @xmath14 , using a model of the position - dependent dust density , , and temperature , , derived by davidson et al .  ( 1992 ) from 50 and 90  photometry of the galactic center .",
    "our results are only weakly sensitive to uncertainties in and  because the cnd is optically and geometrically thin and the fir emission is in the rayleigh - jeans limit .",
    "the other variables in equations ( [ eq-2_1])([eq-2_3 ] ) are determined by the alignment properties of the grains as follows .    the quantities  and  are respectively the dust absorption cross sections for light polarized along the  and  directions , where  is parallel to the projection of the local magnetic field onto the plane of the sky ,  points toward the observer , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the angle between  and north , measured counterclockwise from north .",
    "to compute  and , we modeled the grains as oblate spheroids with semiaxes @xmath17 parallel to the symmetry axis and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) perpendicular to the symmetry axis .",
    "we assumed that the angular momentum , , of a rotating spheroid is aligned perfectly with its symmetry axis by the barnett effect . in this approximation ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xcite ) , where  and  are respectively the cross sections for light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the symmetry axis , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the angle between  and the plane of the sky .",
    "for a given @xmath24 ratio , we computed  and  in the electric dipole approximation using draine s ( 1987 ) dielectric function for astronomical silicates .",
    "notice that @xmath25 and @xmath26 depend only on _ ratios _ of the grain cross sections , which are independent of grain size in the electric dipole limit .",
    "thus , apart from its weak influence on the grain dynamics ( discussed below ) , the value of @xmath18 does not affect our calculations .",
    "we assumed for simplicity that the grain shape is independent of location and let @xmath24 be a free parameter .",
    "the angles @xmath23 and @xmath16 are functions of the position - dependent disk magnetic field .",
    "we computed @xmath23 and @xmath16 from a numerical tabulation of model gc2 kindly supplied by mark wardle .",
    "the model is self - similar and to determine the hydro variables uniquely it is also necessary to specify the magnetic field , @xmath27 , the density , @xmath28 , and the radial ( @xmath29 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath30 ) velocity components of the neutral gas at some fiducial radius , @xmath31 .",
    "we set @xmath32pc and chose @xmath33 mg , consistent with h  i and oh zeeman splitting measurements of the cnd ( reviewed by morris & serabyn 1996 ) .",
    "we set @xmath34 , near the lower end of the range of estimates for the density ( @xcite ) , and assumed that @xmath35  and @xmath36 , consistent with kinematic models of the cnd ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the alignment of  with respect to  is characterized by the quantity @xmath37 , \\label{eq-2_6}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the angle between  and  and angle brackets denote the average for all grains .",
    "we calculated @xmath39 from the theory of ambipolar alignment ( rhm ) . , and hence the polarizations , by an uncertain factor that depends on poorly - known magnetic properties of the grains .",
    "the increase would be @xmath40% for grains composed of ordinary paramagnetic substances but could be larger for superparamagnetic grains . ] for supersonic drift speeds , @xmath39 depends only on @xmath24 and @xmath41 , where   is the gas - grain drift speed and @xmath42 is the gas thermal speed ( rhm ) .",
    "we computed  at each point using model gc2 to predict the local hydro variables and a prescription for the grain dynamics ( draine 1980 ) which includes lorentz and gas drag forces on the grains .",
    "for the purposes of calculating the grain dynamics only , we represented the grains as spheres with equivalent radii @xmath43 and arbitrarily set @xmath44 .",
    "changing @xmath18 by a factor of 2 would have virtually no effect on the calculated polarizations .",
    "the wk models do not predict the gas temperature ; we set @xmath45k , consistent with observations of various molecular lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "the factor @xmath46 in equations ( [ eq-2_2])([eq-2_3 ] ) represents the possible effects of a random magnetic field component .",
    "we set the total field to @xmath47 , where  is the ordered field predicted by model gc2 and  is a random component .",
    "we assumed that  is perpendicular to ( as would be the case if  is due to alfvnic turbulence ) and that  has an axisymmetric , gaussian distribution of amplitudes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for this model , it is straightforward to show that @xmath48 where the `` turbulence parameter , '' @xmath49 , is the ratio of the energies in the ordered and disordered field components .",
    "we assumed for simplicity that this ratio is independent of position and let @xmath49 be a free parameter .",
    "note that @xmath46 decreases monotonically from @xmath50 ( no disordered field ) to @xmath51 ( disordered field in equipartition with the ordered field ) .",
    "we constructed synthetic maps of @xmath52 , the 100  polarization predicted by ambipolar alignment , for 3,136 parameter combinations sampled uniformly on the intervals @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for each @xmath55 combination , we calculated the stokes parameters on a grid of sightlines uniformly spaced by @xmath56 in right ascension and declination .",
    "each map of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 was then convolved with a @xmath57 ( fwhm ) gaussian beam to model the observed resolution ( h93 ) and maps of  were computed from the convolved stokes parameters .",
    "optimal values of @xmath24 and @xmath49 were obtained by performing a @xmath58 fit to , the 100polarization observed along @xmath59 lines of sight ( h90 , h93 ) .",
    "our fits omitted 7 observed sightlines for which the fir emission is not associated with the cnd .",
    "we did not attempt to fit @xmath26 , which is a good diagnostic of the magnetic field geometry but not of the alignment mechanism .",
    "strictly speaking , the value of  we calculate for each sightline is the _",
    "polarization for a hypothetical ensemble of disks with identical distribution functions for .",
    "that is , discrepancies between  and  are due not only to uncertainties in our theoretical model but also to random fluctuations in . to include the effects of random fluctuations on @xmath58",
    ", we assumed that the polarization observed along the @xmath60th sightline has dispersion @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the observational uncertainty quoted by h93 and  represents the uncertainty due to fluctuations in .",
    "we assumed for simplicity that  is the same for every sightline and performed the @xmath58 fits independently for different choices of .",
    "we found that @xmath58 per degree of freedom is @xmath63 in some subset of parameter space if @xmath64% .",
    "that is , we are able to obtain a reasonable fit to the data if we assume that the random fluctuations in  are about half a percent .",
    ", since some of the errors that are ascribed to fluctuations in are undoubtedly due to idealizations in our model .",
    "for example , h93 pointed out that the wk models predict polarizations that are symmetric in the northwest and southeast quadrants .",
    "however , the observations clearly show departures from symmetry in the southeast quadrant ; not surprisingly , these points contribute about twice as much on average to @xmath58 as the rest of the data . ]",
    "figure  1 is a contour plot of @xmath58 per degree of freedom ( @xmath65 ) for the case @xmath66% .",
    "evidently the observations are consistent with a continuum of models with different combinations of @xmath24 and @xmath49 ; this is due to the fact that a small increase in @xmath24 ( which tends to reduce ) can always be compensated by a decrease in @xmath49 ( which tends to increase ) .",
    "thus , the contours of constant @xmath65 slope downward with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the parameters allowed by our fits are consistent with independent constraints : for example , observations show nearby molecular clouds have @xmath67 ( jones 1989 ; myers & goodman 1991 ) .",
    "also , zeeman splitting observations of the 21 cm hi ( @xcite ) and 18 cm oh ( @xcite ) lines toward the galactic center imply that the magnetic energy density of the cnd is comparable to the turbulent energy density inferred from atomic and molecular linewidths ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these observations are consistent with the presence of nonlinear alfvn waves in the cnd , for which @xmath67 .",
    "nonlinear alfvn waves are predicted by some models of magnetic braking ( mouschovias & morton 1985 ) .",
    "similarly , photopolarimetry of the 9.7  silicate resonance implies that the aligned grains in nearby molecular clouds are oblate with @xmath68 ( hildebrand & dragovan 1995 ) . a model with @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( indicated by the filled circle in fig .",
    "1 ) is compared with the observations in figure  2 . for this model , @xmath71 and",
    "the mean discrepancy between  and  is @xmath72% .",
    "our results are insensitive to the precise values of the hydrodynamic variables ; for example , the polarizations we calculate would be virtually identical if we arbitrarily increased or decreased  or @xmath73 by factors of @xmath74 .",
    "this robustness is due to the fact that , for the highly supersonic drift speeds in the wk models ( @xmath75 for gc2 ) , the efficiency of ambipolar alignment saturates at a value which depends only on the grain shape ( see rhm , fig . 12 ) .",
    "however , our results _ are _ sensitive to the magnetic field geometry .",
    "for example , we attempted to fit the observations by arbitrarily replacing the magnetic field predicted by model gc2 with a purely toroidal field of the same magnitude at each point ; we were unable to find solutions with @xmath76 for these models .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether one can model the cnd observations successfully with more detailed hydro models ( e.g. , wardle & knigl 1993 ) which calculate the vertical structure of the disk .",
    "previous models of the cnd magnetic field geometry ( wk , h90 , h93 ) have accounted successfully for the observed polarization position angles by assuming that the efficiency of grain alignment is independent of position .",
    "the saturation of ambipolar alignment at large drift speeds provides a natural justification for this assumption .",
    "in contrast , it is difficult to reconcile the uniform efficiency required by the observations with other alignment mechanisms .",
    "if the grains are superparamagnetic , then the efficiency of davis - greenstein alignment would be saturated but the saturation efficiency would be very sensitive to the local dust - to - gas temperature ratio : independent calculations on dg alignment ( lazarian 1995 ) show that factor of 2 variations in @xmath77 would cause factor of @xmath78 variations in . the efficiency of purcell s mechanism ( purcell 1979 ) is insensitive to  but sensitive to the timescale for changes in the grain surface properties ; it is difficult to see why the latter should be uniform throughout the cnd and have just the right value to reproduce the observations .",
    "we conclude that the degree and uniformity of the alignment required by the observations are natural consequences of ambipolar alignment but difficult to explain with other mechanisms .",
    "1 .   we have calculated the 100  linear polarization from the cnd using a model that attributes the grain alignment to ambipolar diffusion in the wardle-  model accretion disks .",
    "our polarization maps depend on just 2 adjustable parameters , the grain axis ratio , @xmath24 , and the mean ratio , @xmath49 , of the energies in the random and ordered magnetic field components",
    "we estimated the values of @xmath24 and @xmath49 by performing a @xmath58 fit to the observed 100  polarizations ( h90 , h93 ) .",
    "our models provide a reasonable fit to the observations if we assume that the @xmath79 fluctuations in the observed polarizations due to turblence in the cnd are @xmath80% .",
    "3 .   the observations are consistent with a continuum of models with different @xmath55 values .",
    "a model with @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the parameter values implied by independent constraints , falls close to the minimum of @xmath58 per degree of freedom . for this model , @xmath71 and the mean error in the predicted polarizations is @xmath72% .",
    "4 .   our calculations imply that grains in the cnd must be aligned with an efficiency such that @xmath81 , nearly independent of position .",
    "the degree and uniformity of alignment required by the observations are natural predictions of the ambipolar mechanism but require `` fine tuning '' of the parameters in other alignment theories .",
