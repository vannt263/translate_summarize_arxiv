    "carbotte _ et al._@xcite recently suggested that a signature of the @xmath4mev spin resonance which is measured in spin polarized inelastic neutron scattering experiments@xcite in the superconducting state of optimally doped yba@xmath3cu@xmath5o@xmath6 ( ybco ) , is also seen in the in - plane infrared optical spectrum as a function of energy @xmath2 . following this initial suggestion schachinger and",
    "carbotte@xcite proceeded to analyze optical spectra in other high-@xmath0 compounds and found that similar spin resonances develop in many of the cuprates but not in all .",
    "these authors provided a simple technique@xcite to extract from infrared data an approximate electronic carrier - spin fluctuation spectral density which not only gives a picture of the position and width of the spin resonance , but also gives an absolute measure of its coupling to the charge degrees of freedom .",
    "more recently , consideration of in - plane optical data@xcite in ybco at several temperatures reproduced well the temperature evolution of the @xmath4mev resonance@xcite measured in neutron scattering experiments and gave a carrier - spin fluctuation spectral density which showed considerable variation with temperature .",
    "it consists of a broad spin fluctuation background which extends , in frequency , to several hundred millivolts and which persists in the normal state .",
    "superimposed on this background is a spin resonance contribution which exists only in the superconducting state for optimally doped ybco and grows as @xmath7 is lowered .",
    "the growth of the resonance reflects modifications to the spin spectrum connected with the development of the superconducting state as the temperature is lowered below @xmath0 ( the superconducting critical temperature ) .",
    "it is found that feedback effects increase the stability of superconductivity and , within an eliashberg formalism for the superconducting state , lead directly to a ratio of the @xmath8-wave gap amplitude to the value of @xmath0 which is considerably larger@xcite than the bcs value of 4.3 in agreement with experiment .",
    "other observed properties of the superconducting state can also be understood directly within the same framework .",
    "most prominent among these are ( 1 ) agreement with experiment for the value of the zero temperature condensation energy per copper atom,@xcite ( 2 ) the fact that only about one third of the total optical spectral weight condenses into the superfluid density at zero temperature.@xcite this arises because it is mainly the coherent part of the charge carrier spectral density which condenses while the incoherent boson assisted background is largely unaffected by the condensation .",
    "( 3 ) the large peak observed in the microwave conductivity around @xmath9k@xcite is understood as due to the collapse of the electronic scattering rates@xcite which results from a low frequency gaping of the spin fluctuation spectrum due to the onset of superconductivity .",
    "( 4 ) there is also a corresponding peak in the thermal conductivity which the calculations explain.@xcite    in this paper we wish to extend the work to the @xmath1-axis optical conductivity@xcite to see if it too can be satisfactorily understood within a generalized eliashberg formalism with kernels determined from in - plane optical conductivity data.@xcite the out - of - plane optical response has been the subject of considerable recent interest@xcite due in part to the observation of an important violation of the conventional ferrell - grover - tinkham@xcite ( fgt ) sum rule .",
    "this sum rule is obeyed by conventional superconductors but not by some high @xmath0 cuprates in the direction perpendicular to the cuo@xmath3 planes . in this case",
    "the missing spectral weight under the real part of the optical conductivity which disappears on entering the superconducting state , does not necessarily equal the superfluid density which condenses into a delta function at zero frequency @xmath10 in the real part of the optical conductivity . in this paper",

    "note also that the @xmath8-wave conductivity has a small structure ( on the scale of the figure ) at @xmath92 corresponding to a maximum in slope for @xmath80 and has another small structure at @xmath85 corresponding to a kink in the curve .",
    "these structures have their origin in the particularities of the @xmath8-wave state . for example , in @xmath8-wave , the quasiparticle density of states as a function of energy is linear in @xmath2 at small @xmath2 and has a logarithmic singularity at @xmath92 before taking on its normal state value at large @xmath2 .",
    "this singularity is much weaker than for the corresponding @xmath81-wave case for which the density of states is zero up to @xmath92 at which point it displays a inverse square root singularity .",

    "the inelastic scattering at such energies is large and smears out any such small structures . however , now there is a significant structure at @xmath83 plus the energy of the peak in @xmath31 namely @xmath94mev . since in a @xmath8-wave",
    "superconductor electrons at the fermi energy with momentum along the main diagonals have zero gap , the boson assisted processes start , in principle , at zero energy plus the boson energy @xmath101 rather than twice the gap plus @xmath102 . but such processes make only a small contribution to the real part of the conductivity and are not seen as a prominent structure in this quantity . at the gap energy @xmath83 the density of electronic states , however , has a logarithmic van hove singularity and this is sufficient to produce the structure at @xmath103 described above .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in the work of carbotte and coworkers@xcite and we return to it below .",

    "this quantity contains a recognizable picture of @xmath31 .",
    "here we point out that after the main drude peak has largely decayed with increasing @xmath2 , there is a region of low conductivity in @xmath80 which is followed by a rise at higher energies .",
    "this rise corresponds to the boson assisted incoherent part of the electron quasiparticle spectral density .",
    "the coherent delta function which is also present in the quasiparticle spectral density contributes the drude . in our work",
    "this part contains about 25% of the total spectral weight .",
    "the boson assisted region at higher energies can be used to model @xmath31 rather than taking it from some simple theory such as mmp .",
    "we can use the solid curve which shows the in - plane data@xcite to get an experimentally measured @xmath31 .",
    "when this is done we find that it consists of the @xmath4mev spin resonance measured in inelastic spin polarized neutron scattering experiments , plus a background extending up to @xmath104mev which we model by an mmp spectrum ( [ eq:12 ] ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath31 gives the dashed curve which agrees with the experimental data in the boson region .",

    "we see that we now have an excellent fit to the data throughout the entire frequency range .",
    "we note the impurities hardly affect the boson assisted region which determines @xmath31 but dominate at low @xmath2 and that some resonant scattering must be included to get agreement in this region .    the agreement obtained between eliashberg theory and experiment",

    "also shown by vertical arrows are the positions of @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",
    "we note structures at each of these places and this information is valuable .",
    "note that at @xmath119 the large negative oscillation seen in @xmath115 is mainly caused by the kink in @xmath31 ( gray squares ) at about @xmath122mev .",
    "the density of electronic states effects clearly distorted the spectrum above the resonance peak and @xmath115 stops agreeing with the input @xmath31 in this region until about @xmath123mev where agreement is recovered . in summary , @xmath115 contains some information on singularities in @xmath117 as well as on the shape and size of @xmath31 and , in the superconducting state , the two effects can not be clearly separated .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath115 remains a valuable intermediate step in the construction of a charge carrier - exchange boson interaction spectral density from optical data .",
    "we next turn to the @xmath1-axis dynamics and present results first for a bcs model . to proceed we need to specify the transverse coupling .",
    "we have presented in the theory section two possible models .",
    "the first one is coherent tunneling with the matrix element @xmath19 conserving in - plane momentum and probably equal to @xmath124 where @xmath36 is the angle of * k * in the two dimensional cuo@xmath3 brillouin zone .",
    "the other model is incoherent tunneling for which momentum is not conserved . to be definite",
    "we will use @xmath125 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:4c ] ) ) in the impurity potential .",
    "other values of @xmath126 have been studied by hirschfeld _",
    "et al._@xcite and by others@xcite to which the reader is referred for more details .    in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we show bcs results for the real part of the @xmath1-axis conductivity @xmath127 vs. @xmath2 and compare with the in - plane conductivity @xmath80 ( dotted curve ) . in this case the gap is @xmath86mev and the in - plane impurity scattering rate is @xmath128mev .",
    "we see that the structure at @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the dotted curve for @xmath80 have been smeared out somewhat more when compared with the equivalent results shown in fig .",
    "this is due to the larger impurity content .",
    "this curve is for comparison with our @xmath1-axis results which we now describe .",
    "the solid curve is for the coherent tunneling case with @xmath129 .",
    "this hopping probability eliminates the nodal quasiparticles along @xmath130 which do not participate in the out - of - plane dynamics .",
    "this gets rid of much of the remaining drude like contribution at very low @xmath2 which is still clearly present in the dotted curve although it is substantially reduced by superconductivity as compared to the normal state drude ( see fig .",
    "the solid curve is small at small @xmath2 and peaks just below @xmath131 where the dotted curve for the in - plane case has a small structure . at higher energies",
    ", there is little difference between the in - plane and out - of - plane @xmath80 although the magnitude of these two quantities is of course very different .",
    "if instead of using @xmath19 we had used a constant @xmath132 for the @xmath1-axis transport , the out - of - plane @xmath127 would mirror the in - plane case @xmath80 .",
    "this would also hold in the more complex eliashberg calculations .",
    "only the magnitude is different between in - plane and out - of - plane in this case because of differences in over all multiplicative factors in front of the expression for the conductivity .",
    "the final curve in fig .  [ f3 ] , dash - dotted , is for the incoherent case .",
    "we see that it too is near zero at small @xmath2 although it rises out of zero more rapidly than does the solid curve .",
    "it shows no structure whatever at the gap or at twice its value .",
    "the main rise is accomplished within the region @xmath133 . at high @xmath2 it saturates to a constant value of one .",
    "this is because we have normalized our results to the normal state conductivity and the curve becomes very flat .",
    "the corresponding normal state conductivity would be a horizontal line at this saturated value , constant for all @xmath2 .",
    "this behavior bares no relation to the in - plane coherent result .",
    "the results for @xmath127 presented so far are for comparison with those based on solutions for the eliashberg equations given in the previous section and which properly include inelastic scattering through the spectral density @xmath31 . before presenting our @xmath1-axis results in this case",
    "we stress again that the boson exchange kernel @xmath31 is an in - plane quantity and is taken from our discussion of the in - plane conductivity .",
    "it is not fitted to any @xmath1-axis data .",
    "it is to be used unchanged to calculate the out - of - plane conductivity assuming coherent hopping with @xmath134 .",
    "the solid curve in fig .  [ f4 ] are the in - plane eliashberg results which are included for comparison with the dashed curve which is for the @xmath1-axis . in the boson assisted region , which would not exist in a bcs theory ,",
    "both curves have a remarkably similar behavior . at very low frequencies , a region which comes mainly from the coherent delta function part of the carrier spectral density , and which is",
    "the only part included in bcs , we note a narrow drude - like peak in the solid curve .",
    "this part is suppressed in the @xmath1-direction ( dashed curve ) because the contribution from the nodal quasiparticles are effectively left out by the @xmath135 weighting term .",
    "also , shown for comparison are our previous bcs results for coherent hopping ( dotted curve ) .",
    "these results show no resemblance to our eliashberg results and also do not agree with experiment .",
    "what determines the main rise in the region beyond the drude part of the conductivity in @xmath127 are the boson assisted processes and this rise does not signal the value of the gap or twice the gap for that matter but rather a combination of @xmath83 and the resonance energy @xmath114 .    in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] we compare the data from homes _ et al._@xcite on the same graph for in - plane ( dotted ) and out - of - plane ( solid ) conductivity @xmath80 .",
    "it is clear that in the @xmath1-direction , the nodal quasiparticle seen in the dotted curve are strongly suppressed .",
    "this favors the @xmath124 matrix element for the @xmath1-axis dynamics as we have just seen .",
    "further , in the boson assisted region the two curves show almost perfect agreement with each other , which again favors the @xmath124 coupling as illustrated in the theoretical curves of fig .",
    "one difference is that the main rise , indicating the onset of the boson assisted incoherent ( in - plane ) processes , appears to have shifted slightly toward lower frequencies in the @xmath1-axis data as opposed to a shift to slightly higher frequencies in our theory .",
    "it should be remembered , however , that in the raw @xmath1-axis data , large structures appear in the conductivity due to direct phonon absorption and these need to be subtracted out , before data for the electronic background of fig .",
    "[ f5 ] can be obtained . in view of this , it is not clear to us how seriously we should take the relatively small disagreements that we have just described between theory and experiment .    with the above reservation kept in mind we show in our last fig .",
    "[ f6 ] a comparison of various theoretical results with experimental @xmath1-axis conductivity ( black solid line ) .",
    "there are five additional curves .",
    "the black ones are obtained from an eliashberg calculation based on the mmp model for @xmath31 with impurities @xmath136mev included to simulate the fact that the samples used are not perfect i.e. are not completely pure , but this parameter does not play a critical role in our discussion .",
    "incoherent @xmath1-axis coupling is assumed with @xmath125 ( black dotted ) .",
    "it is clear that this curve does not agree with the data and that the coupling along @xmath1 can not be dominated by incoherent hopping between planes .",
    "this is also in agreement with the results of a theoretical study by dahm _",
    "et al._@xcite who also observed better agreement for coherent @xmath1-axis conductivity in the overdoped regime .",
    "on the other hand the fit to the black dashed line is good in comparison .",
    "it uses the same mmp model but with coherent coupling of the form @xmath129 .",
    "this fit may already be judged satisfactorily but it should be remembered that if we had used the model of @xmath31 with the @xmath4mev peak included instead of mmp , the agreement would have deteriorated .",
    "this is troubling since one would expect that coupling to the @xmath4mev spin resonance would be stronger in the @xmath1-direction data than it is in the in - plane data .",
    "this is because the @xmath1-axis emphasizes the hot spots around the antinodal directions which connect best to @xmath130 in the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "this is the position in momentum space where this spin resonance is seen to be located in optimally doped ybco . on the other hand , recent arpes data@xcite which fit",
    "well the mfl ( marginal fermi liquid ) phenomenology show little in - plane anisotropy for scattering around the fermi surface and this is consistent with the findings here .",
    "the dash - dotted curve in fig .  [ f6 ] illustrates the fit to the data that can be achieved with a dominant coherent piece and subdominant incoherent contribution .",
    "it is not clear to us that such a close fit is significant given the uncertainties in the data and the lack of uniqueness in the fitting procedure .",
    "it does , however , illustrate the fact that a small amount of incoherent @xmath1-axis hopping can not be completely ruled out from consideration of the infrared data and that this data can be understood quite well within eliashberg theory .",
    "the last two curves ( solid gray and dotted gray ) are based on bcs @xmath8-wave theory and are reproduced here to illustrate the fact that such a theory is unable to explain the @xmath1-axis data .",
    "the solid gray curve is with @xmath137 and the dotted gray one for incoherent @xmath1-axis transport . compared with our eliashberg results",
    "the agreement with the data is poor .",
    "we have considered the @xmath1-axis charge response as revealed in the real part of the frequency dependent optical conductivity @xmath127 .",
    "results for a pure bcs model , which includes only elastic impurity scattering , show no agreement with the data in- or out - of - plane .",
    "a generalized eliashberg approach based on a spin fluctuation mechanism leads to much better agreement .    in this approach",
    "the coherent delta function like part of the electron spectral density which is sharply peaked at the quasiparticle energy leads to a drude type response in the normal state and a bcs type response in the superconducting state .",
    "the dominant incoherent background of the electron spectral density provided by the coupling to the spin fluctuations , however , leads to an additional boson assisted region for the conductivity which is not strongly changed by the onset of superconductivity except that it is a shift by roughly @xmath83 .",
    "this part of the conductivity , not included in bcs , contains the largest part of the optical spectral weight ( of order 75% ) and can be used to get information on the underlying inelastic processes that presumably cause superconductivity .",
    "the in - plane conductivity reveals coupling to the @xmath4mev resonant peak seen in spin polarized neutron scattering as well as to the spin fluctuation background extending to high energies . for coherent @xmath1-axis hopping the boson region in @xmath127 has the same form as it does in the in - plane case and this fact",
    "is largely born out in the experimental data .",
    "this would not be the case if the @xmath1-axis coupling were incoherent .",
    "assuming pure incoherent coupling gives no agreement with the data although a best fit is obtained with a small subdominant incoherent part in addition to a dominant coherent part .",
    "an important conclusion coming out of our analysis is that the @xmath1-axis conductivity data gives independent confirmation for the form of the charge carrier boson spectral density obtained solely from in - plane infrared optical data .",
    "while the infrared conductivity at higher energies is dominated by the inelastic processes and not much affected by a modest amount of elastic impurity scattering , the low energy part is much more sensitive to impurities and depends less directly on inelastic scattering . in this sense , this frequency region can be partly understood within bcs theory at least at low temperatures .",
    "one needs to remember , however , that the spectral weight under the drude - like curve is only a fraction of the entire spectral weight and comes only from the delta function - like part of the electron spectral density .",
    "also , even in this energy region , there are other profound modifications introduced by the inelastic scattering off the spin fluctuation spectrum .",
    "for example all traces of the small structures expected in @xmath80 at the gap and twice the gap values are smeared out because , at such higher frequencies , the inelastic scattering rate is already large . structures do appear in the data , however , at the energy of the gap and of twice the gap plus once or twice the energy of the spin resonance peak which is seen by inelastic neutron scattering at @xmath4mev in optimally doped ybco .",
    "finally , we point out that the spectral density for the excitation spectrum that causes the superconductivity in our approach which consists of a peak at @xmath4mev plus a long nearly constant background extending to very large energies while consistent with naffl of pines and coworkers,@xcite could also arise in other microscopic mechanisms . recently",
    ", the marginal fermi liquid model , proposed early on,@xcite in the development of our understanding of the cuprates , and found to reproduce very well many of the observed anomalous normal state properties , has received new attention because it also fits well the arpes data .",
    "the excitation spectrum of the mfl is quite similar to the one of naffl and has many of the features of our empirically determined spectrum provided its normal state version is modified by the @xmath4mev resonance on entering the superconducting state . in that sense the mfl is equally consistent with optical data .",
    "both , mfl and naffl , are phenomenological models having similar excitation spectra associated with the pairing and so can not easily be distinguished from optics .",
