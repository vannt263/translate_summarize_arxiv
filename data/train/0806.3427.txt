    "with the upcoming start of the cern lhc , our quest for the physics beyond sm is likely to yield positive results . on the theoretical side two of the most important questions to be answered",
    "are the planck - weak hierarchy problem and the flavor puzzle of the sm .",
    "the randall - sundrum model with a warped extra dimension @xcite is just about the only theoretical framework which simultaneously addresses both these questions making it a very compelling model of new physics .",
    "perhaps the most distinctive feature of this scenario is the existence of kk gravitons with masses and couplings at the tev scale which therefore should appear in experiment as widely separated resonances @xcite .",
    "the original rs model as well as all of its extensions are based on a slice of ad@xmath12 space . at the endpoints of this five - dimensional space ( @xmath13 ) ,",
    "two branes are placed which are usually labeled as an ultraviolet ( uv ) planck brane and an ir ( tev ) brane ; and the large hierarchy of scales is solved by a geometrical exponential factor .",
    "postulating modest - sized @xmath14 dimension with radius r and curvature k the tev / planck @xmath15 ratio of scales can be numerically obtained by setting @xmath16 @xmath1711 . in the original rs model",
    "all sm fields were localized on the tev brane .",
    "the only new particles in this model were kk gravitons with no sm gauge quantum numbers .",
    "later , in addition to the kk gravitons , a bulk scalar field with a @xmath18-dependent vacuum expectation value ( vev ) was shown to generate a potential to stabilize the @xmath19 modulus @xcite .",
    "however , this model leaves higher - dimensional operators in the 5d effective field theory suppressed only by tev scale which , in turn , generates unacceptably large contributions to flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) and observables related to the sm electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) .",
    "a natural way to avoid this problem , proposed by @xcite , is to allow sm fields to propagate in the extra dimension . in this scenario",
    "there are kk excitations of sm gauge and fermion fields in addition to those of the graviton .",
    "these states have masses in the tev range and are localized near the tev brane .",
    "the sm particles are the zero - modes of the 5d fields , and the profile of a sm fermion in the extra dimension depends on its 5d mass . by localizing light fermions near the planck brane and heavier ones near the tev brane , the contributions to the fcnc and ewpt are suppressed by scales @xmath20 tev . as a consequence , the kk graviton whose profile is peaked at the tev brane will couple mostly to the top quark , higgs ( or , by equivalence theorem , to the longitudinal @xmath21 and @xmath22 bosons )  @xcite , and kk excitations of the sm fields .",
    "thus , the promising channels to observe rs gravitons are those where produced gravitons are decaying to fields localized near tev brane .",
    "the search for the kk gravitons using its decays to the top quarks was performed in @xcite .",
    "signals from graviton decay to @xmath23 pair , which subsequently decay into pure leptonic or semileptonic final states , were considered in @xcite .",
    "the 4-lepton signal through the decay to a pair of @xmath1 s was studied in @xcite .",
    "reconstruction possibility of the @xmath22 s via their leptonic decays makes this a uniquely clean mode .    in this paper",
    "we would like to address the issue of confirmation of the spin-2 nature of rs gravitons ( for the most recent survey of methods of measuring the spin of new physics particles at the lhc , see @xcite ) .",
    "the conventional way to measure the spin of a new particle involves reconstruction of its rest frame using its decay products and studying the angular distributions about the polarization axis . along these lines , in @xcite generic sample of a 100 @xmath24 events was produced for a spin-0 , spin-1 and spin-2 resonances in an attempt to distinguish spin of the resonance based on the angular dependence of the cross - section .",
    "we , instead , concentrate on the gg@xmath25 zzh , wwz and gg@xmath26 channels where , in addition to the @xmath27 channel considered in the literature before , we have one kk partner of the w or z and one longitudinally polarized w or z in the final state . due to @xmath28 and @xmath29 presence in these new channels , invariant mass of their decay products",
    "should show resonant behavior .",
    "reconstruction of these intermediate kk gauge bosons will be important to reveal the internal structure of the rs model .",
    "we will see that z boson signal angular distribution in the graviton rest frame for all these modes peaks at 90 degrees to collision axis .",
    "performing angular analysis using wigner d - matrix , we will derive the relationship between the graviton spin , angular distribution peak value , and other theoretically calculable quantities . as our method only requires to measure this peak value , where most of the signal events will be concentrated",
    ", we may optimistically achieve this goal with a relatively low sample of @xmath30(10 ) events .",
    "we closely follow the model discussed in @xcite and briefly review it here . as discussed above , we allow sm fields to propagate in the extra - dimension and distribute fermions along it to generate observed mass spectrum without introducing additional hierarchies in the fundamental 5d theory .",
    "sm particles are identified with zero - modes of 5d fields , and the profile of the fermion in the extra dimension depends on its 5d mass . as was shown before @xcite , all fermion 5d masses are @xmath30(1 ) parameters with the biggest one , among the sm quarks , being that of the top quark . to specify the model even further ,",
    "the top quark is localized near the tev brane and the right - handed isospin is gauged @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath31 being on the tev brane ( see discussion of the other possibilities in @xcite , for example ) . at the end of the day ,",
    "we are left with three parameters to be measured experimentally .",
    "we define them as @xmath32 ( the ratio of the ads curvature @xmath33 to the planck mass ) , @xmath34 monitors gauge kk masses with the first few being ( 2.45 , 5.57 , 8.7 ...",
    ")@xmath35 , and finally the parameter @xmath36 which defines where the lightest fermion with bulk mass @xmath37 is localized . for",
    "the @xmath31 on the tev brane , @xmath38 ; and parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 will remain free in our analysis .      before proceeding further ,",
    "let us briefly review constraints placed on the warped extra - dimension model with custodial isospin symmetry @xcite , which we adopt in this paper . in the resulting setup of @xcite , kk mass scale as low as @xmath7",
    "3 tev is allowed by precision electroweak data .",
    "regions of parameter space that successfully reproduce the fit to electroweak precision observables with kk excitations as light as @xmath7 3 tev were also studied in @xcite .",
    "phenomenological consequences of the observed @xmath41-mixing were discussed in @xcite . in the model of @xcite tree level exchange of kk gluons gives the dominant contribution to the @xmath41-mixing . in @xcite ,",
    "the cp - violating effects on the @xmath42 system were shown to provide @xmath433.7 tev constraint at 68% cl .",
    "phenomenological constraints from lepton - flavor - violations were discussed in @xcite . in @xcite , `` anarchic '' randall - sundrum model of flavor was studied , and the minimal allowed kk scale of @xmath7 3 tev was found to be permitted for a few points in the natural rs parameter space ; but models with custodial isospin can relax these constraints . in @xcite , extensive analysis of @xmath44 modes was performed , concluding that only the @xmath45 decay have sizable new physics effects . with sm contributions being suppressed , current experimental bounds were translated into the lepton bulk mass parameters . for the first kk gauge boson mass of 2 - 4 tev , 10 - 20@xmath46 deviation from the sm results were found .",
    "top quark flavor violations and b - factory signals were also studied in @xcite .",
    "finally , enhanced contributions to @xmath47 processes generated by beyond the sm operators with @xmath48 structure , present in these frameworks , may impose additional constraints @xcite . without further flavor structure these contributions",
    "were expected to place a lower bound on the kk gluon mass of @xmath30(8 tev )  @xcite . however , most recent studies of the flavor constraints on the new physics mass scale find that the kk gluon mass should generically be heavier than about 21 tev @xcite .",
    "relentless attempts to lower kk - mass scale further still flourish on the market . on this road , a number of other models were proposed trying to improve the prospects to discover kk - particles at the lhc .",
    "one of them is a model presented in @xcite with a somewhat surprising claim that kk masses as low as 1 tev are consistent with all current experimental constraints .",
    "an interesting variant of the warped extra dimension based on 5d minimal flavor violation was recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "the model allows to eliminate current rs flavor and cp problem  @xcite with a kk scale as low as 2 tev . closing the list of examples , a volume - truncated version of the rs scenario called  little randall - sundrum ( lrs ) \" model was constructed in @xcite . with the assumption of separate gauge and flavor dynamics",
    ", this setup allows to suppress a number of unwanted contributions to precision electroweak , @xmath49 , and flavor observables , compared with the corresponding rs case .    summarizing , we may say that kk gauge bosons with masses below 3 tev ( which would imply @xmath50 4 tev ) would be difficult to have in current theoretical constructions .",
    "if this is the case , signals at the lhc , confirming the rs idea , would be extremely difficult to find ; and studies conducted in  @xcite and later in this paper support this unfavored future .",
    "however , in view of the above discussion , it also seems plausible that these models are still being developed ; and , therefore , it is not inconceivable that explicit construction(s ) will be found which will allow kk masses lower than 3 tev without conflict with electroweak precision experiments and/or with flavor physics .",
    "this attitude was taken in @xcite and we in this paper will also adopt this point of view .",
    "after these brief remarks we can write the couplings relevant to our discussions here . since the graviton @xmath51 couples to the energy - momentum tensor @xmath52 , coupling of the nth level kk graviton to the qth and mth level gauge bosons has the generic form : @xmath53 where the magnitude of the @xmath54 coupling constants depends on the overlap of the particle wavefunctions in the extra - dimension .    analytic expressions for the coefficients @xmath54 with the flat zeroth mode gauge boson profile may be found in @xcite and for the @xmath23 and @xmath1 on the tev brane we need to replace them with delta functions .",
    "we present resulting couplings in table [ table ] along with partial decay widths for dominant decay channels for the lightest kk ( n=1 ) graviton which will be the focus of our analysis ; see also @xcite .",
    "the @xmath55 and hh decay channels illustrate equivalence theorem once again , which is valid up to @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the graviton mass .",
    "let us briefly explain the result for the @xmath58 decay mode as it involves off - diagonal elements of the energy - momentum tensor of the gauge fields .",
    "tha gauge boson mass matrix is @xcite : @xmath59 and for the tev brane higgs scenario the off - diagonal elements @xmath60 that describe the mixing of the zero and the mth kk mode @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the off - diagonal elements of the energy - momentum tensor are given by : @xmath62    to the leading order in the @xmath63 , this results in the partial decay rate : @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and we neglected w boson mass in the phase - space consideration .    in the class of models we are working with , @xmath67 for the mass of the lightest kk graviton and the gauge fields @xcite which translates into @xmath68 .",
    "as graviton mass changes from 1.5 to 3 tev ( which will be the typical range for the graviton mass we consider in this paper ) , for our numerical estimates we take the @xmath69 .",
    ".couplings of the first level kk graviton to the sm fields .",
    "the @xmath31 is assumed to be localized on the tev brane .",
    "parameter @xmath70 is the mass of n=1 graviton , @xmath71 is the first root of the first order bessel function and @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath73 is number of qcd colors . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , on fig.[wwz ] we show the normalized angular distributions for the 1.5 tev and the 2 tev graviton masses considered .",
    "we observe that for the 1.5 tev mass peak value of 0.83 for the case of zero background changed to about 0.7 .",
    "this value can also be obtained applying eq.[main ] and using the fact that for this mass @xmath74 as can be seen in table.[table23 ] and the fact that @xmath75 .",
    "for the 2 tev mass value , peak is no longer seen due to the dominance of the background .",
    "cross - section for @xmath76 tev ( solid ) and @xmath77 tev ( dashed ) with cuts as in eq.[cuts1 ] and eq.[cuts2].,width=480 ]",
    "in this work , we have extended earlier studies of the discovery potential of warped gravitons at the lhc which concentrated on the gravitons decaying into the `` gold - plated '' @xmath27 channel , @xmath78 , channel and into the @xmath24 pair .",
    "we have considered resonant production of the first rs kk graviton mode via gluon - fusion process followed by its subsequent decay to @xmath79 and @xmath27 pairs .",
    "we focused on confirmation of the unique spin-2 nature of the graviton using z boson angular distribution in the graviton rest frame for all these modes .",
    "we performed angular analysis using wigner d - matrix in order to derive the relationship between the graviton spin , angular distribution peak value , and other theoretically calculable quantities .",
    "as our method only requires to measure this peak value , where most of the signal events will be concentrated , it may be possible to achieve this goal with a relatively low sample of @xmath30(10 ) events . in any case ,",
    "our main aim in this work is to illustrate how our method can work , at least in principle . using statistical results of @xcite for @xmath80 4 leptons and our analysis of @xmath81 3 leptons + jet + @xmath9 decay modes",
    ", we showed that with 1000 fb@xmath6 of data , these channels allow this number of events to accumulate for the rs graviton up to @xmath7 2 tev . as a byproduct of our analysis",
    ", we found that @xmath82 graviton decay modes , which have not been studied before , have a br comparable to the zero mode decay channels as summarized in tables.[table]-[table23 ] .",
    "these decay modes open new channels to search for the rs gravitons . as an extra bonus , reconstruction of intermediate kk gauge bosons in these modes will be important to reveal the detailed workings of the rs model .",
