    "it is widely believed that non - stellar emission in galactic nuclei indicates the existence of accreting , massive black holes ( e.g. frank et al . 1992 ) .",
    "it is , however , unclear how to understand the various emission spectra from diverse types of agn powered by accreting black holes ( e.g. osterbrock 1989 ) . within the luminous agn population ,",
    "radio luminosities differ greatly and hence the classification into the radio - loud and radio - quiet sub - populations .",
    "the luminous optical / uv / x - ray emission is attributed to accretion flows around massive black holes while the strong radio emission clearly arises from powerful radio jets .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that the x - ray and radio emission from less luminous x - ray bright galactic nuclei ( xbgn ) such as liners and low luminosity seyferts could be due to optically thin advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) ( yi & boughn 1998 , di matteo & fabian 1997 , fabian & rees 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "these sources have x - ray luminosities in the range @xmath7 erg / s . in adafs ,",
    "low - level radio emission arises from an x - ray emitting , optically thin plasma via synchrotron emission ( e.g. narayan & yi 1995b ) .",
    "these sources are characterized by inverted radio spectra and compact emission regions together with hard x - ray spectra ( yi & boughn 1998 ) . since x - ray and radio emission occurs in the same plasma , the x - ray and radio luminosities are correlated and can be used to estimate the mass of the the central black hole ( yi & boughn 1998 ) .",
    "radio jets are observed to be widespread in early type radio galaxies ( e.g. rees et al . 1982 ) . on the other hand , adafs",
    "have been shown to have positive net energy near the rotational axis ( narayan & yi 1995a ) and , therefore , are particularly susceptible to outflows . if x - ray emission from xbgn is due to adafs , it is plausible that radio jets would also be present and could dominate the total radio luminosities of these sources .",
    "in fact , falcke et al . (",
    "1998 ) recently argued that a large fraction of relatively radio - dim active galaxies , qsos , and liners possess parsec scale radio jets .",
    "if so , it might be the case that the radio luminosities of nearly all xbgn are dominated by jet emission .",
    "never - the - less , high angular resolution observations could still reveal the presence of an adaf radio core with its characteristic inverted spectrum .",
    "many of the sources ( xbgn and seyferts ) listed below are jet dominated sources and , yet , have 15 ghz core luminosities similar to those predicted by the adaf model .",
    "franceschini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) reported an intriguing correlation between the total radio luminosities and the dynamically determined black hole masses of a small sample of xbgn consisting primarily of early type galaxies .",
    "they interpreted the correlation as due to adaf radio emission around massive black holes accreting from the hot gas readily available in early type galactic nuclei .",
    "although their explanation ( assuming the accretion rate is determined by the bondi rate and the gas density is directly related to the black hole mass ) is largely implausible ( see  3 ) , the correlation does suggest an interesting trend in radio properties .",
    "many of their sources are likely to contain radio jets . by combining them with those used in yi and boughn ( 1998 )",

    "we examine possible radio / x - ray luminosity relations in pure adaf flows and in radio - jet sources with known black hole masses .",
    "particular attention is paid to the origin of radio activity and we suggest that among xbgn it is useful to designated two populations , radio - bright and radio - dim , which are analogous to more powerful agn populations .",
    "we designate as `` radio - dim '' those sources with 5 ghz luminosities @xmath8 erg / s . even if jets are present in these sources they are likely to be relatively weak , parsec scale jets and may still appear as core dominated sources when observed with moderate angular resolution .",
    "the jet emission in such sources has a flat or inverted spectrum ( e.g. falck , wilson , & ho 1998 ) .",
    "xbgn with luminosities @xmath9 erg / s are designated as `` radio - bright '' ( to distinguish them from the conventional `` radio - loud '' sources which are much more powerful ) .",
    "such sources have more substantial jets and will , therefore , invariably appear extended as well as exhibit steeper spectra .",

    "an alternative explanation is that the observed radio luminosities are due to much more energetic sources , e.g. jets , whose luminosities are not directly related to the radio luminosity of the adaf core .    if the excess radio emission is due to jet activity , then eq . 5 and @xmath57 imply l_r , jet^2l_x , adv^1/xm_bh^(x-1)/x and for a wide range of @xmath72 we expect the dominant scaling @xmath73 .",

    "there are four other sources ( ngc1316 , 4261 , 4374 , and 4594 ) for which moderate angular resolution radio observation and dynamical black hole mass estimates are available .",
    "the x - ray and core radio luminosities of these xbgn are also consistent with the adaf model . considering observational and modeling uncertainties , the agreement is quite good .    in the future ,",
    "high angular resolution radio observation combined with x - ray observations might enable the central black hole masses of xbgn to be estimated .",
    "for example , the nuclear source in ngc3031 ( m81 ) is both small ( @xmath128 pc ) and has an inverted spectrum ( reuter & lesch 1996 ) .",
    "based on its x - ray and core radio flux , the adaf implies a black hole mass of @xmath129 ( see fig .",
    "although source variability has not yet been taken into account , we suggest that future dynamical estimates of the central black hole of ngc3031 wo nt be far from this value",
    ".    multiple epoch , high angular resolution , high frequency radio observations will be crucial to test the adaf mechanism and , subsequently , to estimate central black hole masses . even with such observations , it will still be difficult to characterize sources if they are strongly obscured as expected in seyfert 2 s .",
    "relatively low x - ray luminosity sources will be detected by axaf and will greatly improve the test of the adaf paradigm among liners and other relatively low luminosity xbgn with @xmath130 .",
    "the compact , inverted spectrum characteristics of adafs can also be used to distinguish them from small scale jets which are abundant in xbgn .",
    "a moderate excess of radio emission from such a source probably indicates the presence of low level ( parsec scale ) jet activity .",
    "we propose an xbgn classification scheme analogous to the radio - loud / radio - quiet classification of powerful agn . whereas , it is likely that the radio luminosities for all powerful agn ( radio - quiet and radio - loud ) are due to jets , it is possible for some radio - dim xbgn to be dominated by an adaf core . on the other hand ,",
    "radio - bright xbgn are undoubtedly jet dominated .",
    "adafs are strong , hard x - ray sources and to the extent that they are present in xbgn , it is likely that the @xmath0 kev core luminosities of xbgn will be dominated by adaf emission .",
    "we would like to thank r. van der marel and douglas richstone for useful information on black hole masses , pawan kumar and tal alexander for help with ngc1068 , and ramesh narayan for early discussions on spectral states of accreting massive black holes .",
