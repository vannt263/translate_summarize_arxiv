    "since diakonov et al .  @xcite predicted masses and decay widths of the exotic baryon antidecuplet within the framework of the chiral soliton model , the findings of the exotic baryons have been announced by many different experimental collaborations  ( see , for example , a very recent review  @xcite and references therein ) , though some of them are still under debate .",
    "since the leps and clas collaborations used photons to produce the @xmath0 , it is of great interest to investigate electromagnetic properties of the exotic baryons . in particular , we have to know the magnetic moment of the @xmath0 and its strong coupling constants in order to describe the mechanism of the pentaquark photoproduction .",
    "however , information on its static properties is absent to date , so we need to estimate them theoretically .",
    "recently , we calculated the magnetic moments of the exotic pentaquarks within the framework of the chiral quark - soliton model  @xcite with all relevant dynamic parameters fixed by using empirical data .",
    "we would like to present those results briefly in this talk .",
    "the collective operator for the magnetic moments can be expressed in terms of six constants  @xcite:@xmath1 the parameters @xmath2 are of order @xmath3 , while @xmath4 are of order @xmath5 , @xmath6 being regarded as a small parameter .",
    "though @xmath7 can be calculated numerically within the model , we want to fit them in this work to the experimental data of the octet magnetic moments .",
    "the full expression for the magnetic moments can be decomposed as three different terms : @xmath8 where the @xmath9 is given by the matrix element of the @xmath10 between the purely symmetric collective states @xmath11  @xcite , and the @xmath12 is given as the matrix element of the @xmath13 between the symmetry states as well .",
    "the wave function correction @xmath14 is given as a sum of the interference matrix elements of the @xmath9 between purely symmetric states and those in higher representations .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath0 mass constrains further the parameter space of the model ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) . denoting the set of the model parameters by @xmath15 the model formulae for the set of the magnetic moments in representation @xmath16 ( of dimension @xmath17 ) @xmath18 can be conveniently cast into the form of the matrix equations:@xmath19\\cdot\\vec{w},%\\ ] ] where rectangular matrices @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "these matrices depend on the pion - nucleon @xmath23 term .",
    "in order to find the set of parameters @xmath24 $ ] , we minimize the mean square deviation for the octet magnetic moments : @xmath25-\\mu_{b,\\,{\\rm exp}}^{8}\\right)^{2}}/7 $ ] , where the sum extends over all octet magnetic moments , but the @xmath26 .",
    "the value @xmath27 is in practice independent of the @xmath23 in the physically interesting range @xmath28 mev .",
    "moreover , the values of the @xmath29 $ ] do not depend on @xmath23 .    similarly , the value of the nucleon strange magnetic moment is independent of @xmath23 and reads @xmath30 in fair agreement with our previous analysis of ref.@xcite .",

    ", this @xmath55 counting is not borne by explicit fits .",
    "the @xmath56 can be parametrized by the following two parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 : @xmath59{ccrcc}% v & = & \\left (   2\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}}-\\mu_{\\mathrm{p}}+3\\mu_{\\xi^{0}}+\\mu_{\\xi ^{-}}-2\\mu_{\\sigma^{-}}-3\\mu_{\\sigma^{+}}\\right )   /60 & = & -0.268,\\\\ w & = & \\left (   3\\mu_{\\mathrm{p}}+4\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}}+\\mu_{\\xi^{0}}-3\\mu _ { \\xi^{-}}-4\\mu_{\\sigma^{-}}-\\mu_{\\sigma^{+}}\\right )   /60 & = & 0.060 .",

    "this is a remarkable feature of the present fit , since when the @xmath6 corrections are included , the @xmath6-independent parameters need not be refitted .",
    "this property will be used in the following when we restore the linear dependence of the @xmath60 on @xmath6 .",
