    "that is , for a subset @xmath8 of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , or @xmath0 , we say that @xmath8 generates the complete ( involution ) lattice in question if the only complete sub lattice ( closed with respect to involution ) including @xmath8 is the whole lattice itself . for @xmath9",

    "special variants of the above results , without considering the lattices @xmath0 and @xmath2 complete , were given in czdli  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "dolgos  @xcite has recently shown that the complete lattice @xmath5 is eight - generated for @xmath28 . finally , we know from zdori  @xcite , which improves strietz  @xcite by reducing 10 to 7 , and from czdli  @xcite that the complete lattice @xmath0 is @xmath17-generated provided @xmath31 and @xmath1 is an accessible cardinal .",
    "although the proofs given here are short , sometimes very short , these proofs rely on nontrivial earlier constructions .",
