    "2001 ) , suggesting that this might be some kind of limiting value . indeed , for low - mass x - ray binaries one can make use of binary evolution theory , combined with a given accretion flow solution , to predict a relation between the minimum quiescent luminosity and the system orbital period p@xmath14  ( see e.g. menou et al .",

    "most importantly , independently of the actual solution for the accretion flow in quiescence , the existence of a minimum luminosity in low - mass x - ray binaries stems directly from the existence of a bifurcation period , p@xmath53 , below which the mass transfer rate is driven by gravitational wave radiation ( @xmath4-driven systems ) , and above which it is dominated by the nuclear evolution of the secondary star ( @xmath5-driven systems ) .",
    "specifically , the outer mass transfer rate @xmath54 increases with decreasing orbital period below p@xmath53 , while increases with increasing orbital period above p@xmath53 ( the same applies to quiescent neutron star x - ray binaries , although with higher normalization ) . for a wide range of donor masses , menou et al .",

    "_ as long as the luminosity expected from a given accretion flow model scales with a positive power of @xmath54 , systems with orbital periods close to the bifurcation period should display the lowest quiescent luminosities_. caveat the large distance uncertainties which affect most bh x - ray binaries ( e.g. jonker & nelemans 2004 ) , this is indeed observed , as illustrated in the right panel of figure  [ fig : qbh ] .",
    "deep observations of short ( @xmath565 hr ) , as well as long ( @xmath20200 hr ) orbital period systems will hopefully add to the slim statistics in support of this argument .",
    "we wish to point out that , given the distance / absorption column to the 3 bh systems with upper limits ( h1705250 , grs100945 and 4u  154347 ; see figure  [ fig : qbh ] ) , several tens of ks of integration with _ chandra _  would be needed in order to detect them , should their luminosity be close to that of the faintest objects .",
    "quiescent ultra - compact x - ray binaries ( with orbital periods p@xmath14@xmath561",
    "hr ) could be primary targets to test this conclusion at the short p@xmath14  end .",
    "however , the argument has been made that the mass - transfer rate evolution has not been studied in any detail for systems with such very low mass ratios .",
    "extreme mass ratios could result in a drastically reduced @xmath54 , making the direct comparison between quiescent ultra - compact and longer period  binaries somewhat dubious ( see jonker et al .",

    "the ideal testbed would be obviously provided by the power off of the as yet super - luminous grs  1915 + 105 , with an orbital period of over 800 hr .",
