    "while the cmb and cluster abundances depend on the fluctuations in mass , galaxy redshift surveys tell us about the distribution of luminous matter .",
    "it is commonly ( and probably naively ) assumed that the distribution of luminous galaxies of a certain type is related to the underlying matter distribution by the ` biasing factor ' , @xmath19 .",
    "we define this as the ratio of the rms fluctuations in the galaxy number density to those in the underlying mass .",
    "thus , the amplitude of the galaxy power spectrum is @xmath20 larger than that of the mass . under the assumption that @xmath19 is scale - independent ,",
    "the shape of the galaxy power spectrum is the same as that of the matter power spectrum .",
    "thus the galaxy power spectrum can be used to constrain the matter power spectrum shape parameter , @xmath21 . as the cluster abundances",
    "only weakly constrain @xmath21 , the addition of galaxy redshift surveys to the joint analysis helps to fix the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "in addition , the redshift space distortion of the galaxy distribution due to peculiar velocities yields a measure of the combination , @xmath22 .",
    "the joint analysis with cmb and cluster abundances allows us to remove the degeneracy in this combination .",
    "constraints on cosmological parameters from redshift surveys have been obtained by fisher , scharf & lahav ( 1994 ) , tadros et al .",

    "many authors have now compared various combinations of data sets at a range of levels of detail ( bond & jaffe 1998 ; gawiser & silk 1998 ; lineweaver 1998 ; white 1998 ; garnavich et al .",
    "1998 ; webster et al . 1998 ; eisenstein , hu & tegmark 1998 ; efstathiou et al . 1998 and roos & harun - or - rashid 1999 ) .",
    "we choose to perform a joint analysis of cmb , galaxy redshift survey and cluster abundance data sets , since they provide complementary constraints on cosmological parameters . as we demonstrate below",
    ", the parameter degeneracies arising from these three data sets are relatively complicated and merit the full likelihood approach adopted in this paper .    in section 2",
    "we introduce the data and outline the methods used to produce likelihoods for each separate set of observations .",
    "we describe our method of combination and some statistical issues in section 3 and present our results in section 4 , discussing them in more detail in section 5 .",
    "a range of different values for cosmological parameters have been inferred from the evolution of the number density of clusters with redshift ( e.g. frenk et al . 1990 ; carlberg et al .",
    "1997 ; bahcall , fan & cen 1997 ; blanchard & bartlett 1998 ; reichart et al .",
    "1999 ) , and in some cases the quoted uncertainties are sufficiently small to make the results incompatible .",
    "this implies that systematic uncertainties are important ( see eke et al .",
    "1998 for a discussion ) . for a joint likelihood analysis ,",
    "the resulting confidence limits on the inferred cosmological parameters are only reliable if the systematic errors present in the individual analyses are less important than the statistical ones .",
    "for this reason , the cluster abundance is addressed using the x - ray temperature function , where this is least unlikely to be the case .",
    "we use two x - ray flux - limited samples .",
    "the first is comprised of the 25 clusters with average redshift 0.05 compiled by henry & arnaud ( 1991 ) . we have incorporated the latest temperature measurements from ginga and asca for these clusters ( henry 1999 ) .",
    "the second sample is comprised of 14 einstein extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) clusters with average redshift 0.38 compiled by henry ( 1999 ) .",

    "1993 ; eke et al .",
    "1998 ) is employed to predict the distribution of cluster redshifts and temperatures for each model .",
    "these are compared with the observed distributions as discussed by henry ( 1997 ) and eke et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , using the ` default ' assumptions detailed by eke et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    as discussed in section 1 ,",
    "the main constraint from cluster abundances is in the @xmath3 , @xmath0 plane , and this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ eachdata ] ( a ) .",
    "our approach follows that of hancock et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and webster et al .",
    "we use the same data as webster et al . , with the addition of the recent qmap points ( de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "this same data set is used and plotted in efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the flat band - power method is employed ( as described in e.g. hancock et al .",
    "1998 ) , although bartlett et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and bond , jaffe & knox ( 1998 ) find that this approximation widens the error ranges on the cosmological parameters .",
    "the conclusions of this letter would not be significantly affected by such a change .",
    "we assume that there are negligible tensor contributions to the cmb power spectrum , as predicted by most inflation models .",
    "we also assume neglible re - ionisation and a harrison - zeldovich primordial power spectrum ( ie . the primordial spectral index @xmath5 ) as favoured by inflation and the cmb data .",
    "we note that changing these assumptions would substantially alter our results .",
    "the remaining family of cold dark matter models are analysed using the boltzmann code of seljak & zaldarriaga ( 1996 ) .",
    "the cmb cobe data point constrains the large scale temperature fluctuations well .",
    "this converts to a strong constraint on @xmath3 for each @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "estimates of the location and height of the first acoustic peak are also provided by the cmb data , and these constrain a degenerate combination of @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( fig . [ eachdata ] ( b ) ) .",
    "putting these together also places a weak constraint on @xmath3 .",
    "the data and method used here are exactly as in fisher et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and webster et al .",
    "we use a sample of 5313 iras galaxies flux - limited to 1.2 jy at 60 @xmath23 m , selected from the iras data base ( strauss et al .",
    "1990 , fisher 1992 ) , and calculate redshift weighted spherical harmonics which may be compared with those predicted given a matter power spectrum .",
    "we use gaussian windows for the redshift weighting , and take into account the redshift distortion using an approximation that is correct only in linear theory . therefore in this analysis",
    "we use only spherical harmonics up to @xmath24 so that the scales probed are large , and the fluctuations can be assumed to be in the linear regime .",
    "it is assumed that the relationship between the galaxy distribution and the matter distribution can be described by the single parameter , the biasing factor for the iras galaxies , @xmath25 . in practice",
    "the relationship between the two power spectra may have many dependencies , including scale dependence .",
    "note that if @xmath4 is actually scale dependent then the information on the shape of the power spectrum given by the iras data would be wrong . however , if the assumption of scale independent biasing is correct then galaxy survey data such as the iras 1.2 jy survey place powerful constraints on the shape of the power spectrum in the scale range examined .",
    "the redshift distortion also provides limits on @xmath26 and hence a constraint on @xmath0 for each value of @xmath27 .",
    "however , this turns out to be a relatively weak constraint .",
    "nevertheless , the range of values of @xmath0 allowed by iras together with cmb or cluster abundances lies well within the range allowed by iras alone .",
    "thus , for this paper , the most important constraint from the iras data is that on the shape of the matter power spectrum which , as will be seen in the next section , manifests itself in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 plane , plotted in fig .",
    "[ eachdata ] ( c ) .",
    "in this letter the three cosmological parameters we vary are : the present day value of the reduced hubble constant , @xmath28  @xmath29 , the matter density of the universe in units of the critical density , @xmath0 , and the matter power spectrum normalisation parameter , @xmath3 , the rms linear fluctuation of matter density in @xmath2 mpc spheres .",
    "the fourth parameter is @xmath4 , which should be regarded as a ` fudge factor ' reflecting our ignorance on how to relate fluctuations in galaxy counts to fluctuations in mass .",
    "we assume that the universe is flat so that @xmath30 as suggested by recent analyses of cmb data which allow for @xmath0 and @xmath31 to vary independently ( eg .",
    "lineweaver 1998 ; tegmark 1998 ; efstathiou et al .",
    "1998 ) .    to transform the information on the shape of the matter power spectrum provided by the iras and cluster abundance data into constraints in the parameter space we consider , we use the bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) approximation formula for the matter power spectrum , parameterised by the shape parameter , @xmath21 .",
    "we use the approximate expression provided by sugiyama ( 1995 ) , @xmath32}\\right ) \\   \\label{eqngamma}.\\ ] ] this , and the cmb power spectrum calculation , require a value for the baryon density which we take from the nucleosynthesis constraint , @xmath33 ( burles & tytler 1998 ) .",
    "our results are relatively insensitive to this value .",
    "using this conservative number of parameters allows a more thorough examination of the parameter space , and despite our large number of assumptions , we find remarkable agreement between the data sets .",
    "comparing results from different data sets enables us to shed some light on how well our current picture of cosmology stands up .",
    "this kind of comparison could be performed by simply comparing the parameter values predicted by different data .",
    "while this is a start , it does not take into account the fact that most measurements are sensitive to more than one parameter .",
    "a full examination of the level of agreement between data sets should include a comparison of likelihood values in multi - dimensional space . in this letter",
    "we have considered the four free parameters @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 and found that there _ is _ a region in the four - dimensional space in which the likelihood functions of each data set are high .",
    "this is important to check before simply multiplying likelihoods , because the final best fit point could be a bad fit to all the data sets used , even if the one - dimensional marginalised joint likelihood functions for each parameter look promising .",
    "the goodness of fit of each data set can be evaluated e.g. by @xmath34 .",
    "combining results is also powerful because the parameter degeneracies from each data set may be complementary .",
    "[ cmbclab3d ] shows a three - dimensional view of the orthogonality of the cmb and cluster abundance confidence surfaces .",
    "the favoured region of parameter space is very much smaller than the regions of parameter space allowed by the single data sets alone , thus yielding much tighter constraints .",
    "this joint likelihood function is computed by calculating likelihoods over a grid in parameter space , then multiplying them together for the different data sets .",
    "note that multiplication of the likelihoods for each data set is strictly correct only in the case where the data sets are _",
    "independent_. while the cmb clearly probes a different part of the universe to either the iras galaxies or the cluster abundance clusters , it is not so clear whether there is some overlap in the iras and low redshift cluster data . in this letter",
    "we assume that these two data sets are independent , and justify it on the basis that ( a ) the redshift ranges do not overlap significantly , the low redshift clusters having a median redshift of 0.05 , while the iras galaxies have a median redshift of 0.02 and ( b ) because iras galaxies are selected in the infra - red , they tend to be field galaxies and so are not likely to be in the clusters sampled in the cluster survey .",
    "this issue also affects the cmb analysis , since the flat band power @xmath34 analysis is not valid if the observations used overlap on the sky and in angular scale range ( spherical harmonic @xmath35 range ) .",
    "we have avoided this by using a set of cmb data points that do not overlap in this way , but the set of data points chosen could be argued to be somewhat subjective .",
    "we obtain confidence limits on each cosmological parameter by marginalising over the other parameters .",
    "if the parameters are well enough constrained then the integration limits used for the marginalisation will not affect the results .",
    "the bayesian interpretation of the integration limits is that we have ` top hat ' priors on each parameter . for the integration in the marginalisation we use @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( in 100 , 100 , 100 , 50 steps respectively ) .",
    "the parameters are so poorly constrained by any single data set that these integration limits do affect some marginalised results . for example",
    ", our range of integration in @xmath3 affects the two - dimensional plot of @xmath1 and @xmath0 for the cmb data ( fig .",
    "[ eachdata ] ( b ) ) , making the contours foreshorten at low @xmath0 .",
    "however , we choose our limits to be wide enough that they do not affect the results when using more than one data set at a time .",
    "thus the one - dimensional marginalised distributions for pairs of data sets plotted in fig .",
    "[ 1ddists ] ( a ) are independent of the priors .",
    "this integration process is computationally costly , and some authors utilise approximations at this point .",
    "for example lineweaver ( 1998 ) and tegmark ( 1998 ) ` project ' the likelihood function to one dimension , taking the maximum value of the likelihood found on varying the other parameters , rather than integrating over all the values of the likelihood for all the possible values of the other parameters .",
    "this approximation is correct when the likelihood function is a gaussian , but not otherwise .",
    "note that when we talk about the 68 per cent confidence surface or contour we mean the ( iso - probability ) boundary to the region containing 68 per cent of the probability ( given our top hat priors ) .",
    "since it is possible to choose reasonable integration ranges such that the results using any pair of data sets are independent of the integration ranges , we may say that just a pair of data sets is sufficient to constrain properly these four parameters ( or three parameters for cmb and cluster abundances ) .",
    "the results for pairs of data sets are shown in fig . [",
    "1ddists ] .",
    "it can be seen that these three data sets are in extremely good agreement , since the parameter values preferred by each pair are consistent .",
    "this is particularly apparent for @xmath0 .",
    "it is a result of the fact that all three 68 per cent confidence surfaces intersect in the same place in three and four dimensions .",
    "it was therefore not surprising to find that the best fit point given in table 1 is within the 68 per cent confidence surface for each single data set .",
    "[ bestfit ]    for the parameter values at the best fit point , the shape parameter for the mass power spectrum @xmath40 , the baryonic density @xmath41 , the cmb quadrupole @xmath42k , the iras distortion parameter @xmath43 and the age of the universe is @xmath44 gyr . in each case",
    ", the errors correspond to the estimated 68 per cent marginalised confidence limits .    as an indicator of how well the joint",
    "optimum fits each data set alone we calculate the @xmath34 value at the joint optimum for each of the cmb and iras data sets , using the method described in webster et al .",
    "the cmb @xmath34 is 22.8 ( we use 23 cmb data points ) and the iras @xmath34 is @xmath45 ( for spherical harmonics up to @xmath24 there are @xmath46 degrees of freedom ) , suggesting that the predicted observations agree well with the actual observations for the parameters at the joint optimum . because of the unbinned nature of the cluster abundance analysis , it is more complicated to find a similar statistic .",
    "however , as discussed by eke et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , all of the models considered predict a relatively even distribution of clusters over the range @xmath47 , but in actual fact there are many more clusters at the low end of this redshift range than predicted by any of the models considered .",
    "this suggests that the selection function for the clusters was poorly modelled , inevitably leading to a poor goodness of fit to the cluster data , independent of the parameter values used in the model ( given the assumptions of this paper ) .",
    "the number of clusters predicted from the best fitting model is @xmath48 at low redshift and @xmath49 at high redshift .",
    "this may be compared to the actual numbers observed , @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively , and can be seen to differ by more than the 1@xmath52 of @xmath53 expected from poisson statistics .",
    "the 1d and 2d marginalised distributions given all three data sets are also shown in figs .",
    "[ 1ddists ] and [ all3_2dmarg ] .",
    "it can be seen that adding in a third data set tightens the constraints further and the 68 per cent confidence limits obtained from these 1d distributions are presented in table 1 .",
    "the non - trivial and reassuring result is that the marginalised distributions of the parameters are consistent when single data sets , or any combination of two data sets , are included .",
    "this means that no single experiment is dominating or pushing the favoured parameter values away from the otherwise preferred ones .",
    "it is thus tempting to suggest that systematic uncertainties in the individual data sets may not be greatly affecting the parameter values that have been inferred by this analysis .",
    "the strong agreement between pairs of data sets can be understood qualitatively as follows .",
    "the cluster abundance data provide a strong constraint on @xmath3 ; the cmb provides a much weaker limit on @xmath3 but one which agrees with the cluster abundance limit .",
    "the iras data provides limits on the combination @xmath54 and so putting this together with the above constraint on @xmath3 produces a small allowed range of @xmath4 .",
    "the cluster abundance data also favour just a small range in @xmath0 .",
    "the different degeneracy directions in the @xmath0,@xmath1 plane from each of the cmb and iras data produce a slightly weaker limit on @xmath0 , but one which agrees with the cluster abundance result .",
    "putting together the strong cluster abundance constraint on @xmath0 with either the cmb or iras limits in the @xmath1 , @xmath0 plane produces a constraint on @xmath1 ; alternatively , just the cmb and iras data can be used to determine an allowed range in @xmath1 ; and each of these routes to @xmath1 produces the same answer .",
    "our results agree well with other recent work which combines data sets to set limits on cosmological parameters ( bond & jaffe 1998 , gawiser & silk 1998 , lineweaver 1998 , white 1998 , garnavich et al .",
