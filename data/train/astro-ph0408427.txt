    "the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; balbus & hawley 1991 , 1998 ; hawley & balbus 1991 ) generates and sustain angular momentum transport in differentially rotating astrophysical discs .",
    "it does so by converting the free energy source contributed by differential rotation into turbulent motions ( e.g. balbus 2003 ) , which transport angular momentum via maxwell stresses .",
    "most mri models in non - ideal mhd conditions adopt either the ambipolar diffusion ( blaes & balbus 1994 , maclow et al .",
    "1995 and hawley & stone 1998 ) or resistive approximations ( jin 1996 , balbus & hawley 1998 , papaloizou & terquem 1997 , sano & miyama 1999 ; sano , inutsuka & miyama 1998 , sano et .",

    "the inclusion of hall conductivity terms is a relatively recent development ( wardle 1999 ( w99 hereafter ) , balbus & terquem 2001 , sano & stone 2002a , b ; 2003 , salmeron & wardle 2003 ( sw03 hereafter ) and desch 2004 ) .",
    "when the hall effect dominates over ambipolar diffusion , fluid dynamics is dependent on the alignment of the magnetic field with the angular velocity vector of the disc ( wardle & ng 1999 ) , and wave modes supported by the fluid are intrinsically modified .",
    "for example , left and right - circularly polarised alfven waves travel at different speeds and damp at different rates in this regime ( pilipp et al .",
    "1987 , wardle & ng 1999 ) . both the structure and growth rate of mri perturbations can be substantially modified by hall conductivity , especially when the coupling between ionised and neutral components of the fluid is low ( w99 , sw03 ) .    in a previous paper",
    "we presented a linear analysis of the vertical structure and growth of the mri in weakly ionised , stratified accretion discs ( sw03 ) . in that study the components of the conductivity tensor",
    "were assumed to be constant with height .",
    "the obtained solutions illustrate the properties of the mri when different conductivity regimes are dominant over the entire cross - section of the disc .",
    "we found that when the magnetic coupling is weak , modes computed with a non - zero hall conductivity grow faster and act over a more extended cross - section than those obtained using the ambipolar diffusion approximation . the height above the midplane where the fastest growing modes peak depends on the conductivity regime of the fluid . when ambipolar diffusion is important , perturbations peak at a higher @xmath7 than when the fluid is in the hall limit .",
    "furthermore , when the coupling is weak , perturbations computed with a full conductivity tensor peak at different heights depending on the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the angular velocity vector of the disc .",
    "this is a consequence of the dependency of the hall effect on the sign of @xmath8 ( w99 ) .",
    "finally , we showed that in the hall regime perturbations can have a very complex structure ( high wavenumber ) , particularly when the magnetic field is weak . in these conditions ,",
    "many modes were found to grow , even with a very weak magnetic coupling .",
    "these results suggest that significant accretion can occur in regions closer to the midplane of astrophysical discs , despite the low magnetic coupling , due to the large column density of the fluid .",
    "this idea contrasts with the commonly accepted view that accretion is important primarily in the surface regions , where the coupling between ionised and neutral components of the fluid is much stronger , but the column density is significantly smaller .    in a real disc ,",
    "the components of the conductivity tensor vary with height ( e.g. wardle 2003 ) as a result of changes in the abundances of charged particles , fluid density and magnetic field strength .",
    "this , in turn , is a consequence of changes in the ionisation balance within the disc , which reflects the equilibrium between ionisation and recombination processes .",
    "the former are primarily non - thermal , triggered by cosmic rays , x - rays emitted by the central protostar and radioactive materials .",
    "the later can , in general , occur both in the gas phase and in grain surfaces ( e.g. oppenheimer & dalgarno 1974 , spitzer 1978 , umebayashi & nakano 1980 , nishi , nakano & umebayashi 1991 , sano et .",
    "al . 2000 ) .",
    "as a result , different conductivity regimes are expected to dominate at different heights ( wardle 2003 ) . in this paper",
    "we revisit the linear growth and structure of mri perturbations using a height - dependent conductivity tensor .",
    "we assume that the disc is thin and isothermal and adopt a fiducial disc model based in the minimum - mass solar nebula ( hayashi 1981 , hayashi , nakazawa & nakagawa 1985 ) .",
    "further , we assume that ions and electrons are the main charge carriers , which is a valid approximation in late stages of accretion , after dust grains have settled towards the midplane of the disc . as an indication of the timescales for this settling to occur , nakagawa ,",
    "nakazawa & hayashi ( 1981 ) show that the mass fraction of @xmath9 - @xmath10 grains well mixed with the gas phase , ( i.e. not settled ) , drops from @xmath11 to @xmath12 in t @xmath13 to @xmath14 years . furthermore , although the timescale for dust settling all the way to the equator may exceed the lifetime of the disc , grains can settle within a few pressure scaleheights about the midplane in a much shorter timescale ( dullemond & dominik 2004 ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section [ sec : formulation ] summarises the formulation , including the governing equations , fiducial disc model and ionisation balance .",
    "section [ sec : method ] describes the linearisation , parameters of the problem and boundary conditions .",
    "results are presented in sections [ sec : results1 ] and [ sec : results2 ] .",
    "we summarise in section [ sec : results1 ] the test models used in this study and present the ionisation rates as a function of @xmath7 at representative radial locations from the central protostar ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 au ) . the importance of different conductivity regimes at different heights is also described for a range of magnetic field strengths",
    ". then , in section [ sec : results2 ] , the structure and growth rate of mri perturbations at the radii of interest are analysed , including a comparison with results obtained using different configurations of the conductivity tensor , sources of ionisation and disc structure .",
    "we find that the mri is active over a wide range of fluid conditions and magnetic field strengths .",
    "for example , for the fiducial model at @xmath15 au , and including cosmic ray ionisation , unstable modes are found for @xmath18 g. when @xmath2 mg @xmath3 g , these perturbations grow at about the ideal - mhd rate @xmath19 times the dynamical ( keplerian ) frequency of the disc .",
    "results are discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] and the paper s formulation and key findings are summarised in section [ sec : summary ] .",

    "the fluid is assumed to be weakly ionised , so the effect of ionisation and recombination processes on the neutral gas , as well as the ionised species inertia and thermal pressure , are negligible . under this approximation ,",

    "there is , however , an intermediate density range characterised by a varying degree of coupling amongst charged species . in these circumstances , there is a component of the conductivity tensor that is perpendicular both to the electric and magnetic fields .",

    "for example , using an mrn grain model ( mathis , rumpl & nordsieck 1977 ) with a power law distribution of grain sizes between @xmath64 and @xmath65 angstrom , hall conductivity is important for @xmath66 ( wardle & ng 1999 ) .",

    "the ionisation balance within the disc ( section [ subsubsec : ionisation ] ) determines the abundances of charged species ( ions and electrons ) .",
    "these , in turn , determine the configuration of the conductivity tensor . in protostellar discs , outside of the central @xmath67 au , ionisation sources are non - thermal ( hayashi 1981 ) and the ionisation fraction is not enough to produce good magnetic coupling over the entire cross - section of the disc . in these conditions ,",
    "the region around the midplane is likely to be a magnetically `` dead zone '' ( gammie 1996 ) .",
    "our model incorporates the vertical structure of the disc , but neglects fluid gradients in the radial direction .",
    "this is an appropriate approximation , as astrophysical accretion discs are generally thin and changes in the radial direction occur on a much bigger length scale than those in the vertical direction .",
    "including the vertical structure means that perturbations of spatial dimensions comparable to the scale height of the disc , which are associated with either a strong magnetic field ( @xmath68 ) or low conductivity , can be explored .",

    "as small as @xmath143 times the cosmic abundance may be enough to make turbulent the whole cross - section of the disc , eliminating the central magnetic dead zone ( fromang et .",
    "this is so because metal atoms generally take the charges of molecular ions , but recombine with electrons ( via radiative processes ) at a much more slower rate .",

    "because of this effect , the abundance of metal atoms in a disc could be quite insensitive to the spatial distribution of dust grains .",

    "al . 2002 ) ,    @xmath160    it is clear then , that the evolutionary stage and activity of the disc are important factors in the ionisation balance , as they influence the degree of sedimentation of dust grains .",
    "as the disc evolves , dust grains tend to occupy a thin layer around the midplane , becoming removed in any dynamical sense from the gas at higher vertical locations .",
    "this causes the ionisation fraction of the gas to increase , by eliminating recombination pathways on dust surfaces . in the present work ,",
    "we have used equation ( [ eq : ne2 ] ) to calculate the electron ( and ion ) number density .",

    "the system of equations ( [ eq : continuity ] ) to ( [ eq : induction ] ) , ( [ eq : j_curlb ] ) and ( [ eq : j - e ] ) was linearised about an initial steady state where fluid motion is exactly keplerian and the magnetic field is vertical , so @xmath162 and @xmath163 . in the initial state",
    "both @xmath39 and @xmath164 vanish , so the changes in the conductivity tensor due to the perturbations do not appear in the linearised equations . as a result",
    ", it is not necessary to explore how the perturbations affect the conductivity of the fluid and only the values in the initial steady state are required .",
    "we assume that the wavevector of the perturbations is perpendicular to the plane of the disc ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "these perturbations , initiated from a vertical magnetic field , are the fastest growing modes when the fluid is in either the hall or resistive conductivity regimes , as in these cases magnetic pressure suppresses displacements with a non - zero radial wavenumber ( balbus & hawley 1991 , sano & miyama 1999 ) . however , as pointed out by kunz & balbus ( 2004 ) through their analysis of local axisymmetric mri , this is not necessarily the case for perturbations in the ambipolar diffusion limit .",
    "their formulation includes radial and vertical wavenumbers as well as vertical and azimuthal field components .",
    "results indicate that in this regime , the fastest growing modes may exhibit both radial and vertical wavenumbers .",
    "interestingly , in this configuration unstable modes are present even for outwardly increasing angular velocity profiles , contrary to the case in ideal - mhd .",

    "another difference with the previous case is noticeable for stronger fields ( @xmath326 mg ) , where before the mri was active even at the midplane . in this case , the abrupt change in the ionisation balance at the height where x - ray ionisation becomes active , ( fig .",

    "where x - rays are excluded ( @xmath327 ) , the main ionising agent is the decay of radioactive elements within the disc .",

    "this is in agreement with the local analysis ( w99 ) , which showed that the growth of mri perturbations in the ambipolar diffusion limit decreases steadily with the local magnetic coupling . as a result",
    ", the local growth of these modes is severely restricted near the midplane .",
    "this is especially effective for weaker fields , when global effects are less important , due to the high wavenumber of the perturbations .",

    "when the field is weaker than this , perturbations are damped near the midplane .",
    "this is particularly evident for @xmath338 mg and is probably related to the fact that at @xmath0 au the magnetic coupling at the midplane in this limit is very low . even for @xmath310 mg , @xmath293 in the hall limit @xmath339 and it decreases to @xmath236 for @xmath264 mg ( note that these values are significantly smaller than the ones shown in fig .",

    "the extent of the dead zone increases , especially for weak fields ( @xmath18 mg ) and perturbations grow for stronger fields than in the minimum - mass solar nebula disc .    in the present formulation , it was assumed that ions and electrons are the only charge carriers . as discussed earlier , this is valid in late evolutionary stages of accretion , when dust grains have sedimented enough towards the midplane that they can be neglected when studying the dynamics of the gas at higher @xmath7 .",
    "the timescale for this settling to occur is expected to be affected by mhd turbulence .",
    "although in quiescent discs dust grains may quickly settle into a thin sub - layer about the midplane , the vertical stirring caused by mhd turbulence could potentially transport them back to higher vertical locations , preventing them from settling below a certain height ( dullemond & dominik 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "the efficiency of this process is dependent on the disc being able to support mhd turbulence in the vertical locations where dust grains are present . on the other hand",
    ", dust grains can reduce the abundance of free electrons , and the efficiency of mhd turbulence itself , by providing additional recombination pathways on their surfaces . to make things more complex ,",
    "it is likely that the transition between vertical sections where dust grains are well mixed with the gas phase and those completely depleted of grains by settling , occur over a finite thickness ( dullemond & dominik 2004 ) .",
    "ultimately , the equilibrium structure of accretion discs will reflect the complex interplay between all these processes .",
    "it is expected that the structure and growth of mri unstable modes in such environments will be affected by the dependency of the ionisation balance with height in the presence of chemistry taking place on grain surfaces .",
    "the study of the properties of the mri in a disc where dust dynamics and evolution are determined consistently , and where hall conductivity is taken into account , is essential to understand more fully the presence and efficiency of mri - driven angular momentum transport in accretion discs .",
    "nevertheless , from the results presented in this paper , it is clear that hall diffusion is crucial for the realistic modelling of the magnetorotational instability in protostellar discs , particularly at a distance of @xmath359 a few au from the central object .",
    "more generally , hall conductivity is an important factor when studying the magnetic activity of low conductivity discs at these radii .",
    "we have presented in this paper the vertical structure and linear growth of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) in weakly ionised , stratified accretion discs , assuming an initially vertical magnetic field .",
    "both the density and the conductivity are a function of height and the conductivity is treated as a tensor and obtained with a realistic ionisation profile .",
    "two disc models were explored : the minimum - mass solar mebula disc ( hayashi 1981 , nakagawa & nakazawa 1985 ) and a more massive disc , with the mass and surface density increased by a factor of @xmath17 .",
    "this formulation is appropriate for the study of weakly ionised astrophysical discs , where the ideal - mhd approximation breaks down ( gammie & menou 1998 ; menou 2000 ; stone et al .",
    "the ionisation sources relevant here , outside the inner @xmath67 au from the central object , are non - thermal : cosmic rays , x - rays and radioactive decay . for the minimum - mass solar nebula model",
    "we compare solutions obtained including all three sources of ionisation with those arrived at assuming that cosmic rays are excluded from the disc by the protostar s winds .",
    "recombination processes are taken to occur in the gas - phase only , which is consistent with the assumption that dust grains have settled into a thin layer about the midplane , and ions and electrons are the only charge carriers .",
    "perturbations of interest have vertical wavevectors ( @xmath165 ) only , which are the most unstable modes ( when initiated from a vertically aligned magnetic field ) in both the hall and ohmic regimes ( balbus & hawley 1991 ; sano & miyama 1999 ) .",
    "this is not necessarily the case in the ambipolar diffusion limit ( kunz & balbus 2003 ) , where the fastest growing modes can have radial as well as vertical wavenumbers . under the adopted approximations , the properties of the mri in the ambipolar diffusion and ohmic conductivity limits are identical .",
    "three parameters were found to control the dynamics and evolution of the fluid : ( _ i _ ) the local ratio of the alfvn to sound speed ( @xmath200 ) ; ( _ ii _ ) the local coupling between ionised and neutral components of the fluid ( @xmath204 ) , which relates the frequency at which non - ideal effects are important with the dynamical ( keplerian ) frequency of the disc ; and ( _ iii _ ) the ratio of the components of the conductivity tensor perpendicular to the magnetic field ( @xmath393 ) , which characterises the conductivity regime of the fluid .",
    "these parameters were evaluated at @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 au for a range of magnetic field strengths .",
    "the linearised system of ode was integrated from the midplane to the surface of the disc under appropriate boundary conditions and solutions were obtained for representative radial locations of the disc as a function of the magnetic field strength and for different configurations of the conductivity tensor .",
    "the main results of this study are summarised below .    1 .   for the minimum - mass solar nebula model , incorporating cosmic ray ionisation ( the fiducial model ) : + at @xmath0 au ,",
    "unstable mri modes exist for @xmath1 g. when @xmath2 mg @xmath3 g , the most unstable modes grow at @xmath359 the ideal - mhd rate ( @xmath382 ) .",
    "hall diffusion dominates the structure and growth rate of unstable modes for all magnetic field strengths for which they grow . for strong fields ,",
    "ambipolar diffusion shapes the envelope of the perturbations , which peak at an intermediate height .",
    "finally , at this radius , a magnetically dead zone ( gammie 1996 , wardle 1997 ) exists when @xmath304 g. as expected , the vertical extent of this zone decreases when the magnetic field gets stronger and/or when a more massive disc model is used .",
    "+ at @xmath16 au , mri modes grow for @xmath385 mg and the growth rate is close to the ideal mhd rate for @xmath386 mg @xmath387 mg .",
    "perturbations incorporating hall conductivity have a higher wavenumber and grow faster than solutions in the ambipolar diffusion limit for @xmath262 mg .",
    "unstable modes grow even at the midplane for @xmath394 mg but for weaker fields , a small dead region exists .",
    "+ at @xmath17 au , the mri is active for @xmath391 mg .",
    "the growth rate is close to the ideal - mhd rate for @xmath110 mg @xmath392 mg and when @xmath18 mg , perturbations obtained with a full conductivity tensor grow significantly faster than modes in the ambipolar diffusion limit .",
    "modes show only a very small dead region when @xmath341 mg",
    "when the magnetic field is weak ( e.g. @xmath362 mg at @xmath0 au ) , the maximum growth rate of unstable mri modes ( @xmath316 ) increases with the strength of the magnetic field , a feature driven by ambipolar diffusion .",
    "3 .   when cosmic rays are assumed to be excluded from the disc , unstable modes at @xmath0 au grow only for @xmath383 g. results at @xmath16 au only change slightly , while solutions at @xmath17 au are not affected at all , as expected .",
    "4 .   for the massive disc model ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 , incorporating cosmic ray ionisation )",
    ", mri perturbations grow for stronger fields at @xmath16 and @xmath17 au , in relation to the minimum - mass solar nebula model .",
    "results at @xmath0 au are unchanged , as in this case , the effective surface density is not significantly different .",
    "mri perturbations grow in protostellar discs for a wide range of fluid conditions and magnetic field strengths .",
    "hall diffusion largely determines the structure and growth rate of perturbations at radii of order of a few au from the central protostar .",
    "this indicates that , despite the low magnetic coupling , the magnetic field is dynamically important in low conductivity astrophysical discs and will impact the dynamics and evolution of these discs .",
