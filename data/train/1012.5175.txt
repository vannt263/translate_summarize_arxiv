    "with the advancement of science , low noise measurements at low temperatures are becoming increasingly important .",
    "experiments probing quantum mechanical phenomena require high degree of immunity from stray noise present in our surroundings . though it is relatively easy to reach temperatures as low as 10mk in commercial dilution refrigerators , achieving similar electronic temperatures on the other hand is far from being trivial .",
    "this is due to the fact that the microscopic system to be studied is connected to measurement instruments at room temperature .",
    "the electromagnetic noise coming from the room temperature environment perturbs the system through propagation through the measurement lines . to eliminate such disturbance , effective cryogenic filters are necessary for each measurement line .    in the literature",
    "there are various types of filters which have been developed , for example thin film filters @xcite , distributed thin - film microwave filters @xcite , thermocoax@xmath0 ( flers , france ) filters @xcite to name a few .",
    "more recently researchers have concentrated on powder filters with increased performance @xcite .",
    "though these filters have high performance , they are relatively bulky and can not be used in space constrained cryogenic systems , especially when a large number of measurement lines are required .",
    "it was essential to design a filter which is effective in the ghz frequency range and that can easily be installed into space constrained cryogenic systems . in this article",
    "we detail the fabrication of such a filter and demonstrate its efficiency by measuring the low temperature superconducting transition of a granular material .",
    "in figure [ schematic ] we have shown the schematic of our filter as installed in our @xmath1he cryostat .",
    "our filter is divided into three stages .",
    "the first stage consists of twisted pairs of constantan wires inserted into a cu / ni tube filled with eccosorb crs 117 ( ec ) ( portion between points a and d in figure [ schematic ] ) .",
    "the second stage is an inductor embedded in the cold finger using a mixture of copper powder and stycast ( d in figure [ schematic ] ) .",
    "this stage has been added to ensure efficient cooling of the measurement lines at the lowest temperature point . in the third stage",
    "a rc - filter is added to adjust at will the desired cut off frequency , which , in our case is @xmath2115khz ( at the base of d in figure [ schematic ] ) .    for fabricating the first stage we took thirty pairs of twisted constantan wires ,",
    "one from each pair is for the signal line and the other is a ground line connected to the lowest temperature stage of the cryostat ( point c in figure [ schematic ] ) .",
    "the insulated constantan wire had a diameter of 0.12 mm with a length of 1.2 m .",
    "all the twisted pairs were grouped together and pushed inside a cu / ni tube having an outer diameter of 3.5 mm . while putting these twisted pairs we fixed a needle - less hypodermic syringe filled with ec at the end of the tube .",
    "this ensured that the wires entering the tube were fully coated with the ec .",
    "since this process was done at a very slow rate the material filled the tube volume completely .",
    "this tube was left overnight for the ec to solidify and then installed into a @xmath1he refrigerator . at the room temperature end of the ec filled tube we connected a rf shielded aluminium box with 30 sma connectors ( point a in figure [ schematic ] ) .",
    "the wires from the other end were put into a shielded copper cylindrical box attached to the low temperature stage ( 1k plate ) of the refrigerator for thermal anchoring ( point c in figure [ schematic ] ) .    from this shielded box",
    "two sets of 30 wires went out , one from each pair in each set .",
    "one of the two sets were grounded at the low temperature stage in order to keep the same thermal history while the other was put into another similar but smaller ( 15 cm long ) tube filled with ec . at the end of this small tube",
    "we connected a home made 30 pin male connector in order to be able to detach the cold finger containing the combined second and third stage as shown in figure [ schematic ] .",
    "the connector was mounted inside a copper cylinder for shielding from environmental rf noise .",
    "the second stage consists of 30 copper wires bundled together and put inside a ec filled cuni tube , which ends on the top part of the copper cold finger ( d in figure [ schematic ] ) . inside the copper piece",
    "the bundled group of wires were loosely wound to form a coil .",
    "the total length of the wires in the coil is 80 cm .",
    "this coil was then submerged into a 1:1 mixture of white stycast ( emerson and cuming stycast 1266 ) and copper powder which was left to solidify overnight .",
    "the wires coming out of the coil were soldered individually to the input of rc - filters which form the third stage of the filter .",
    "this stage is connected to the base of point d in figure [ schematic ] . for our measurements",
    "we have chosen the resistance in the circuit as 511@xmath3 and the capacitance as 2.7nf , these values can however be adjusted at will .",
    "the resistance used was multicomp - mc 0.063w 0603 1% 511r and the capacitor was murata grm40 sl 272j 50 .",
    "these components have been tested prior to installation in order to ensure that the r / c values do not vary at low temperatures .",
    "the whole second and third stage was encased inside a rf - shielded copper tube as shown in figure .",
    "in figure [ compare ] we have shown a comparison between the attenuation of the first stage in our filter with the powder filters of lukashenko et al .",
    "@xcite , thermocoax and microcoax@xmath4 ( pottstown , pa ) . for our filters",
    "the attenuation was measured using a combination of instruments like vector network analyzer and lock - in amplifiers . for the high frequency part we used agilent e8362c vector network analyzer .",
    "the low frequency part ( f @xmath5 100mhz ) was recorded using a signal generator ( rohde and schwarz smg synthesized signal generator ) and a lock - in amplifier ( signal recovery 7280 dsp and stanford research 830 ) . for thermo and micro coax cables",
    "the measurement was done using two vector network analyzers ( hp87536 for low frequency and agilent e8362c for high frequency ) covering the whole frequency range .",
    "all three filters had similar lengths of conducting wire of approximately 1.2 m. the first stage in our filter had a cut off frequency of @xmath22.1mhz while the filters of ref .",
    "@xcite had a cut - off frequency of @xmath24.4mhz .",
    "microcoax had a cut off frequency of @xmath260mhz and the thermocoax had a cutoff frequency of @xmath220mhz .",
    "one can clearly see that the performance of our first stage is already better than any of the available options .",
    "apart from that , the space required to install our filter is much less when compared with coaxial lines or the filters of ref . @xcite .",
    "though the performance of our first stage is better than the available options , it is not good enough for measurements involving extremely sensitive systems like the superconducting transition of granular superconductors .",
    "we therefore added to the first stage an inductive second stage and a rc filter in the form of a third stage .",
    "the combined second and third stage acts as a low pass filter whose cut - off frequency can be adjusted .    in figure",
    "[ full ] we have shown the attenuation curve for the complete filter at room temperature . the line has its -3db point at @xmath265khz .",
    "the attenuation at low frequencies ( f @xmath5 10mhz ) can be explained by a combination of complex rlc low pass filter as indicated in the lower panel of figure [ full ] .",
    "resistance r@xmath6 represents the resistance of the twisted wires of the first stage , the capacitance c@xmath6 is assumed to exist between the wires and the grounded wall of the tube containing the twisted wires , the inductor l is from the second stage , resistance r@xmath7 and capacitance c@xmath7 forms the rc - filter of the third stage .",
    "the inductance of the coil as estimated from its geometry is @xmath8h .",
    "r@xmath6 is measured to be equal to @xmath280@xmath3 and r@xmath7 and c@xmath7 are fixed 511@xmath3 and 2.7nf , respectively . for this",
    "given circuit the output voltage across the capacitor c@xmath7 in terms of input voltage can be written as    @xmath9    the simulated result for this equation is shown in panel a ( blue dashed curve ) .",
    "the value of capacitor c@xmath6 is determined by the best fit curve and yields 3@xmath101nf .    to test our system in real experiments",
    "we measured the current voltage characteristics of a nanostructured superconducting nanocrystalline diamond device@xcite at 300mk as shown in figure [ iv ] .",
    "panel a represents a measurement where only twisted wires have been employed for the electrical connection and without any kind of filtering .",
    "panel b shows measurements for the lines filtered with thermocoax and commercial filters ( mini - circuits vlfx-80 and slp-1.9 + ) while panel c shows the same measurement using our rf filter .",
    "for the measurements , we start sweeping the current from maximal negative current passing through zero to maximal positive current and then sweeping the current back to maximal negative current .",
    "arrows in panel c indicate the path taken by the measured voltage in the device .",
    "this process was repeated several times generating @xmath2 5000 cycles in all cases .",
    "one can clearly see that while the device was not completely superconducting due to incoming noise while measuring with unfiltered lines , it showed the device to be completely superconducting when being measured with filtered lines . to test our filters in comparison with commonly used thermocoax filters",
    "we have also plotted the histogram of measurements of the switching current as an inset to panels b and c. the full width at half maximum in case of thermocoax filtered lines is @xmath21.1na while for measurements involving our filters it is @xmath20.7na . for the measurements using our filters we have not used any of the commercially available filters which have been added to increase the noise filtering of thermocoax lines .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that our filter is much more effective in filtering noise detrimental to measurements involving very small signals .",
    "in conclusion we have designed a filtering system , with large number of signal lines , which can be installed in a space constrained cryogenic system .",
    "our filter has performance parameters at par with some of the best filters available in literature .",
    "we have also given a plausible model explaining the filtering action in our system at low frequencies ( up to 10mhz ) .",
    "lastly , our filters have been tested with real experiments where we see that for the measurement of very small critical current ( below 1@xmath11a ) the switching current resolution is below 0.1% .",
    "we would like to acknowledge technical assistance of pierre perrier as well as clemens winkelmann who brought our attention to eccosorb crs 117(ec ) .",
    "this work has been partially supported by the french national agency ( anr ) in the frame of its program in ` nanosciences and nanotechnologies ' ( supernems project no anr-08-nano-0 33 )"
