    "determinations of the internal velocity and mass distribution of galaxy clusters are of great value , since they have the potential to constrain both the main cosmological parameters and scenarios for large - scale structure formation ( e.g. , crone , evrard & richstone 1994 ; cole & lacey 1996 ; de theije , van kampen & slijkhuis 1998 , 1999 ) . a recent development on this problem",
    "has been the prediction from cosmological simulations that dark matter halos have a universal density profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ; hereafter nfw ) .",
    "testing the validity of this prediction is an important goal for any study of cluster structure .",
    "the traditional way to study these issues is to construct dynamical equilibrium models for the redshift measurements of individual cluster galaxies .",
    "alternative approaches to infer the mass distribution of clusters are to use x - ray observations ( e.g. , allen 1998 ; hughes 1998 ) , measurements of the weak- or strong - lensing of background sources ( e.g. , bartelmann & narayan 1995 ) , or caustics in redshift space ( geller , diaferio & kurtz 1999 ; diaferio 1999 ) .",
    "each of the different methods has its own uncertainties and biases , and results from different methods are often found to differ .",
    "the causes and magnitudes of these differences remain a hot topic of debate ( e.g. , lewis et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .    here",
    "we focus attention on the dynamical analysis of galaxy redshifts",
    ". analyses of this type have nearly always been restricted to modeling of the projected velocity dispersion profile @xmath4 ( e.g. , kent & gunn 1982 ; merritt 1987 ) , often using the jeans equation ( e.g. , solanes & salavdor - sole 1990 ; den hartog & katgert 1996 ; natarajan & kneib 1996 ) .",
    "the main limitation of such analyses is that there are two unknown functions of one variable , the mass density profile @xmath5 and the velocity dispersion anisotropy profile @xmath6 , that are both constrained by only one function of one variable , @xmath4 . as a result , there is always a degenerate set of models with different @xmath5 and @xmath6 that can all fit the observations equally well ( binney & mamon 1982 ) .",
    "attempts are often made to break this degeneracy by assuming that either one of @xmath5 or @xmath6 is known , so that the other can be determined .",
    "popular assumptions are that the velocity distribution is isotropic , or that the mass distribution can be calculated from the observed number density by the assumption of a constant mass - to - number density ( or mass - to - light ) ratio",
    ". however , neither of these assumptions has a strong physical justification , so these approaches do not remove the underlying degeneracy .    as a result of steady improvements in instrumentation , and in particular the advent of efficient multi - object spectrographs , the available redshift samples for galaxy clusters have been steadily increasing in size .",
    "important recent datasets are the enacs ( eso nearby abell cluster survey ) ( e.g. , katgert et al .",
    "1996 ) and the cnoc1 ( canadian network for observational cosmology ) cluster redshift survey ( e.g. , yee , ellingson & carlberg 1996 ) . with improved statistics it should become possible to extract not only velocity dispersion profiles from the data , but also higher order moments that describe deviations of the observed velocity histograms from a gaussian shape ( zabludoff , franx & geller 1993 ) .",
    "such measurements have the potential to break the degeneracy between the mass and velocity distribution , as emphasized in this context by , e.g. , merritt ( 1987 ; 1993 ) and merritt & saha ( 1993 ) .    here",
    "we focus on the data from the cnoc1 cluster survey .",
    "redshifts were obtained for galaxies in 16 clusters at @xmath7@xmath8 , selected on the basis of their x - ray luminosity .",
    "previous analyses of these data were all based either on use of the virial theorem ( carlberg et al .",
    "1996 ; hereafter c96 ) or the jeans equation ( carlberg et al .  1997a , b , c ; hereafter c97a , b , c ) .",
    "these analyses yielded the important result that if cluster of galaxies have a velocity distribution that is not too far from isotropic , then the cnoc1 data are consistent with clusters having an approximately constant mass - to - number - density ratio , and a mass - density profile that is approximately of the nfw form with a scale radius that is consistent with predictions from cosmological simulations .",
    "however , because of the degeneracy intrinsic to the jeans equation , models with significant anisotropies and very different mass profiles can fit the projected velocity dispersion profile equally well .",
    "so the important question is : can the range of allowed models for the cnoc1 data be reduced by considering not only the projected velocity dispersion profile , but also the entire @xmath0 dataset and the implied higher - order velocity moments ?",
    "this question is the main topic of the present paper . to answer it",
    ", we present a new analysis of the cnoc1 dataset , in part similar in spirit to that suggested by merritt & saha ( 1993 ) , but with some differences ( see  [ ss : discdf ] below ) .",
    "in  [ s : jeansmodels ] we first repeat some of the jeans modeling of @xmath4 , but using a different approach from that employed by c97a , b , c .",
    "the results not only provide an illustration of the degeneracies involved in the modeling , but also serve as a useful starting point for the more detailed analysis . in  [ s : dfmodels ] we analyze the full @xmath0 dataset .",
    "we seek a best - fit model using a variety of statistics , including the likelihood of the dataset and the shape and gauss - hermite moments of the grand - total velocity histogram .",
    "the confidence regions and goodness - of - fit for the best - fit model are estimated using monte - carlo simulations . in  [ ss : uncertainties ]",
    "we discuss possible uncertainties in our analysis , and how robust the conclusions of our analysis are in view of these uncertainties . in ",
    "[ s : discconc ] we present and discuss the final conclusions . in appendix",
    "a we compare our modeling approach to that of ramirez & de souza ( 1998 ) and ramirez , de souza & schade ( 1999 ) , who recently used a more approximate method to constrain the orbital anisotropy of cluster galaxies from observed cluster velocity histograms ( including that for the cnoc1 sample ) .",
    "in the cnoc1 cluster survey redshifts were obtained for galaxies in 16 different clusters . the characteristic size and velocity of each cluster",
    "can be quantified by , e.g. , the radius @xmath9 inside which the average mass density equals @xmath10 times the critical density of the universe ( at the given redshift ) , and the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath1 . for our dynamical analysis",
    "we treat the data similarly as in c97b : we assume that clusters form a homologous sequence , each with identical structure in dimensionless units . to study this dimensionless structure",
    "we consider the dataset that contains for each galaxy in the survey the quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the projected distance from the cluster center , @xmath14 is the observed line - of - sight velocity with respect to the systemic cluster velocity , and @xmath9 and @xmath1 are taken from the analysis of c97b .",
    "one may consider the @xmath15 as quantities drawn from ` the ensemble cluster ' .",
    "the advantage of combining data from different clusters is that it reduces the influence of , e.g. , substructure and non - sphericity on the properties of the dataset . with this approach ,",
    "spherical equilibrium models are likely to provide an adequate description of the data ( see  [ ss : axisym ] and  [ ss : homology ] below ) .",
    "hereafter we write @xmath0 instead of @xmath15 , with the understanding that all quantities discussed are dimensionless unless otherwise noted . in our dynamical analysis",

    "1996 ) and interloper contamination .",

    "the parameterized fit is shown in figure  [ f : projnumden ] .",
    "the fit to the data is statistically acceptable , but note that the fit is not unique ; the parameters of equation  ( [ projnumden ] ) are strongly correlated , and are not all equally well constrained .",
    "c97c showed that the projection of a profile such as that advocated by nfw also provides an acceptable fit to the data .    to interpret the dynamics of the ensemble cluster we first model the projected velocity dispersion profile using the jeans equation for a spherical system .",
    "the software used for this was similar to that discussed in van der marel ( 1994 ) .",
    "the intrinsic galaxy number density profile @xmath32 follows from the projected galaxy number density profile @xmath18 by solution of the relevant abel transform equation .",
    "an ansatz is made for the mass density profile @xmath5 of the cluster , and from this the gravitational potential and gravitational force are calculated .",
    "the jeans equation is then solved for the intrinsic velocity dispersions of the system ( the tangential velocity dispersion @xmath33 and the radial velocity dispersion @xmath34 ) , for some velocity dispersion anisotropy profile @xmath6 , where @xmath35 .",
    "the intrinsic velocity dispersion components in the direction to the observer are then weighted with the intrinsic galaxy number density and projected along the line of sight to yield the projected line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile @xmath4 , which can be compared to observations .    as discussed in ",
    "[ s : intro ] , there is always a degenerate set of models with different @xmath5 and @xmath6 that all fit @xmath4 equally well .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to see to what extent this degeneracy can be broken by modeling not only the projected velocity dispersion profile , but also the individual @xmath0 data points ( and thus indirectly the higher order velocity moments ) .",

    "the projected velocity dispersion profile @xmath4 of the cnoc1 ensemble cluster was derived in c97b , with appropriate correction for interloper contamination . the dispersion profile that we have used in our analysis",
    "was obtained with a similar but slightly updated treatment of the data , and is shown in figure  [ f : dispprof ] .",
    "the inferred profile is mildly different from that analyzed in c97b , but is equivalent in a statistical sense .",
    "eleven constant-@xmath37 models were constructed to interpret the data , with @xmath37 chosen such that the ratio @xmath44 was sampled logarithmically between @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for each @xmath37 we determined the @xmath5 for which the model predictions best fit the data . to this end",
    "we used a grid in the @xmath47 parameter space . for each @xmath47 we calculated the shape of the predicted velocity dispersion profile , and the density normalization @xmath39 that yields the best fit to the observed velocity dispersion profile in a @xmath48 sense",
    "we then sought the minimum @xmath48 over the @xmath47 parameter space to find the best - fitting mass density profile @xmath5 for the given @xmath37 .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles predicted by these best - fit models are shown as curves in figure  [ f : dispprof ] . apart from their small radii behavior ( where there are no strong constraints from the data ) the model predictions are similar for the different values of @xmath37 , as expected based on the degeneracy of the problem .",
    "the small differences between the various models are due to the fact that a parameterized form was used for the mass density @xmath5 ; the true @xmath5 that best fits the data may not be exactly of the adopted form",
    ". however , the fits to the data in figure  [ f : dispprof ] are all statistically acceptable , as judged by the @xmath48 of the fit .",
    "so even though a non - parameterized modeling approach would likely yield mass densities @xmath5 that differ from the parameterized form adopted here , the differences would not be statistically significant .",

    "very radially anisotropic models formally attain their best fit for @xmath50 , i.e. , with decreasing mass densities near the center .",

    "the enclosed mass @xmath52 is then strictly independent of @xmath37 for all radii .",
    "the present result is different in that @xmath52 for the models studied here does depend strongly on @xmath37 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , but not for @xmath57 .",

    "when combined with the mass density profile @xmath5 for each model one obtains the mass - to - number - density ratio @xmath59 , which is shown in the bottom left panel of figure  [ f : massprof ] .",

    "so it is not an intrinsic property of the adopted parameterizations that isotropic models have approximately constant @xmath59 over the region where this quantity is constrained by the data .",

    "the jeans modeling therefore shows that the cnoc1 data are consistent with both an nfw mass density profile and a constant mass - to - number - density ratio for clusters of galaxies , but only if the unknown velocity dispersion anisotropy has a particular value that is close to isotropic .",

    "however , approximate confidence intervals are obtained by determining how @xmath41 , @xmath40 and @xmath146 vary in figures  [ f : massparam ] and  [ f : massprof ] when @xmath44 is varied over , e.g. , its 68.3% confidence range .",

    "the likelihood is only one of many statistics that one can use to test the validity of a model .",
    "there are several reasons why it is useful to quantitatively consider other statistics as well .",
    "first , other statistics will be sensitive to different aspects of the data , and can therefore yield different estimates of the best model and different ( possibly smaller ) confidence regions .",
    "second , there is no guarantee that any of our models actually provides an adequate representation of the df that underlies the data ( e.g. , the ensemble cluster may not be perfectly spherical or have non - constant @xmath37 ) . while the likelihood suggests that the best - fit model of  [ sss : likeanalysis ] is statistically acceptable , other statistics may well indicate that none of our models are acceptable .",
    "third , the likelihood analysis shows that some of our models are more likely than others , despite the fact that all models fit the projected velocity dispersion profile equally well .",
    "the likelihood provides little insight into _ why _ this is the case , and other statistics may do a better job in this respect .",
    "based on these arguments we have considered some other statistics that address the properties of the grand - total velocity histogram for the ensemble cluster .    the grand - total velocity distribution predicted by a given model is simply : @xmath153 where @xmath130 is given by equation  ( [ probfunc ] ) .",
    "however , this method of calculating the predicted velocity distribution for a model provides no insight into the random fluctuations caused by the shot noise .",
    "the observed grand - total velocity histogram is determined by a finite number of galaxies , and this is best simulated in monte - carlo manner . for each model with given anisotropy we therefore draw velocities from the probability distributions @xmath130 for each of the @xmath122 galaxies in the sample , which yields a simulated grand - total velocity histogram .",
    "this procedure is repeated many times , and for each histogram bin we calculate the median occupation of the bin , and the range around the median that contains the occupation value for 68.3% of the simulations .",
    "figure  [ f : histograms ] shows the predicted , normalized grand - total velocity histograms as function of @xmath154 for three constant-@xmath37 models . in each panel",
    "the predictions are shown as a combination of two thin lines ; for each bin , the histogram occupation falls between these lines in 68.3% of the simulations .",
    "the thick line in each of the panels is the observed velocity histogram .",
    "the predicted velocity histogram is approximately gaussian for the isotropic model ; it is more flat - topped than a gaussian for tangentially anisotropic models , and more centrally peaked than a gaussian for radially anisotropic models .",
    "these results are consistent with previous calculations ( in other contexts ) of the velocity distributions predicted by constant anisotropy models ( e.g. , merritt 1987 ; van der marel & franx 1993 ) .",
    "the observed histogram is neither particularly centrally peaked nor particularly flat - topped , and this is why the likelihood analysis of  [ sss : likeanalysis ] yields a best - fit model that is close to isotropic .",
    "one method to address whether the differences between the observed and predicted grand - total velocity histograms are statistically acceptable is through a @xmath48 quantity that sums the squared residuals over all bins of the velocity histogram , weighted with the shot - noise errors predicted from the monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we calculated this quantity , and found a minimum @xmath155 for the model with @xmath156 .",
    "the expected value with 20 velocity bins is @xmath157 at @xmath142% confidence , suggesting that the best fit model is acceptable .",
    "confidence boundaries on @xmath49 were calculated from the usual @xmath158 statistic , yielding @xmath159 at 68.3% confidence and @xmath160 at @xmath131% confidence .",
    "these results are virtually identical to those derived in  [ sss : likeanalysis ] from the likelihood statistic @xmath126 .",
    "apparently , little information is lost by putting all datapoints together in one grand - total velocity histogram ( which removes information on radial dependencies ) .",
    "more insight can be gained by considering statistics that address the _ shape _ of the grand - total velocity histogram . by construction ,",
    "the predicted histograms for models with different @xmath37 are all normalized , and have the same dispersion .",
    "the most obvious shape statistics are therefore the kurtosis and other higher order moments ( stuart & ord 1991 ) . however , these moments are very sensitive to the wings of the velocity distribution , which are not particularly well constrained ( primarily due to interlopers ) .",
    "the gauss - hermite moments provide more suitable statistics , since they are by construction insensitive to the wings of the distribution ( van der marel & franx 1993 ; gerhard 1993 ) .",

    "the resulting moments were found to be independent of the choice of the bin size in the histogram construction in this case . ] ; hence they are well defined quantities .",
    "the best estimate for @xmath108 depends slightly on the assumed anisotropy ( cf .",
    "figure  [ f : backfrac ] ) , so the inferred @xmath164 and @xmath165 do so as well .",

    "we also calculated @xmath164 and @xmath165 for the models .",

    "the resulting predictions are shown in figure  [ f : backfrac ] as solid dots with error bars .",
    "in essence , the dots are the gauss - hermite moments predicted for the hypothetical case in which complete information on the velocity distribution were available at the radius of each galaxy in the sample .",
    "the error bars show the 1-@xmath1 shot noise variations on these values due to the fact that only a discrete realization of the model is available with a finite number of galaxies , the observed gauss - hermite moments are fixed numbers without error bars ( they are well defined integrals over the observed histogram ) , while the model predictions for the observed values have a shot - noise error .",
    "an alternative view is to think of the observed gauss - hermite moments as estimates of the moments of the underlying distribution . in this view , the models predict a fixed value ( the dots in the figure ) , and the monte - carlo calculated shot - noise errors should be thought of as the errors on the observed values . ] .",
    "these errors are @xmath1680.03 , independent of either @xmath37 or the gauss - hermite order @xmath169 .",
    "the tangentially anisotropic models predict flat - topped velocity histograms , which have @xmath170 and @xmath171 ; the radially anisotropic models predict centrally peaked velocity histograms , which have @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "there is generally more power in the fourth - order term than the sixth - order term .",
    "even higher - order moments are not particularly useful in the present context , since all models that we have studied predict @xmath174 to within the variations expected from shot noise , for all @xmath175 .",
    "the near - zero observed values of @xmath164 and @xmath165 are reproduced only by models that are close to isotropic .",

    "they fall inside the @xmath131% confidence interval for both @xmath164 and @xmath165 if @xmath177 .",
    "these results are broadly consistent with those derived in  [ sss : likeanalysis ] and  [ sss : histogram ] , but not entirely . in particular , tangentially anisotropic models are ruled out at higher confidence by @xmath164 and @xmath165 than they are by the likelihood statistic @xmath126 .",
    "the dynamical analysis in the preceding sections has yielded several interesting conclusions about the structure of clusters of galaxies .",
    "although the analysis has been significantly more detailed than many previous studies for this and other data sets , it still involves a number of simplifying assumptions .",
    "the present section discusses how the approximations in the analysis may have affected the conclusions , and how robust the conclusions are in view of this .",
    "our sample definition assumes that cluster members have @xmath178 in units of the cluster dispersion .",
    "so we identify all galaxies with observed velocities in excess of this limit as interlopers , similar to the approach adopted by yahil & vidal ( 1977 ) ( they use @xmath179 ) .",
    "other than this very conservative cut , no removal of interlopers from the sample is attempted .",
    "this approach differs from that used by most authors who have modeled the dynamics of clusters of galaxies .",
    "fairly complex schemes have recently been developed for the identification of interlopers , with estimated success rates of up to 90% ( e.g. , perea , del omo & moles 1990 ; den hartog & katgert 1996 ) .",
    "these schemes generally rely on mass estimates obtained with specific assumptions about the orbital structure . in the present context",
    "the orbital structure is what we hope to determine , so use of these schemes could possibly introduce subtle biases . although the schemes are tailored to be robust and conservative , we feel it is safer in the present context to model the presence of interlopers in a statistical sense , rather than to try to remove them .",
    "note that this modeling would still be necessary even if we did try to remove interlopers , because no interloper identification scheme can be 100% successful .    in our statistical treatment of interlopers we assumed that the density of interlopers is homogeneous in velocity .. interlopers are assumed to have a homogeneous density in @xmath14 , while cluster members have a density that increases strongly towards @xmath180 ( see figure  [ f : histograms ] ) .",
    "hence , the probability for a galaxy to be an interloper is a strongly increasing function of @xmath154 . ]",
    "this assumption is directly verifiable , since the density of interlopers at velocities @xmath181 can be determined from the cnoc1 dataset . to this end",
    "we extracted from the cnoc1 survey as before the galaxies with k - corrected absolute gunn @xmath20-band magnitude @xmath182 , with exclusion of galaxies in the clusters ms 0906 + 11 and ms 1358 + 62 . from the resulting sample we calculated the density of galaxies in @xmath0 space over the region defined by @xmath106 and @xmath183 , , to determine the interloper density .",
    "this yields results that do not differ significantly from those obtained here . ] and also over the region defined by @xmath106 and @xmath178 .",
    "comparison of these densities yields a direct estimate of the interloper fraction @xmath108 for the sample studied in  [ s : dfmodels ] .",
    "this approach yields @xmath184 , fully consistent with the values inferred from the likelihood analysis shown in figure  [ f : backfrac ] ( the best - fitting model identified by figure  [ f : likebest ] has @xmath185 ) .",
    "this provides direct evidence that the density of interlopers is similar for @xmath186 as for @xmath183 , thus supporting the assumption underlying our analysis .",
    "this should also serve as a warning for interloper removal schemes , which can never identify interlopers with small velocities .",
    "the second assumption in our analysis is that the probability @xmath108 for a galaxy at known @xmath13 but unknown @xmath14 to be an interloper is independent of @xmath13 .",
    "this appears somewhat counter - intuitive , since the surface density @xmath18 of cluster members is strongly peaked towards @xmath187 .",
    "so if the surface density of interlopers @xmath188 is homogeneous , one would expect @xmath108 to decrease towards @xmath187 approximately as @xmath189^{-1}$ ] .",
    "by contrast , our assumption implies @xmath190 , i.e. , that the density of interlopers ( with @xmath191 ) increases as steeply towards @xmath187 as does the density of cluster members .",
    "this may not necessarily be incorrect , because matter not belonging to the cluster may in fact be strongly clustered towards it . to address the validity of our assumption we have taken an empirical approach , by dividing the sample of  [ s : dfmodels ] in two equally sized subsamples of galaxies at small and large @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the first subsample contains galaxies with @xmath192 , and has a median radius @xmath193 ; the second subsample contains galaxies with @xmath194 , and has a median radius @xmath195 . for each subsample we redid the likelihood analysis , using an isotropic model",
    "this yields interloper fractions @xmath196 for the first subsample , and @xmath197 for the second subsample .",
    "so @xmath108 does appear to decrease with decreasing radius , but this is barely significant at the 1-@xmath1 level .",
    "however , @xmath198 is @xmath199 times as large as @xmath200 , so @xmath108 certainly does not decrease towards @xmath187 as fast as predicted if @xmath201 were independent of @xmath13 .",
    "so although our assumption may not be fully correct , it does seem acceptable .",
    "all in all , none of the tests that we have done has given us reason to believe that our treatment of interlopers is significantly in error .",
    "also , interlopers make up only a small fraction ( @xmath202% ) of the sample studied in  [ s : dfmodels ] , and we do not expect the final results to be particularly sensitive to their treatment .",
    "there are several restrictions to the dynamical analysis that we have employed .",
    "although we construct phase - space distribution functions and model the full cnoc1 @xmath0 dataset , we do restrict ourselves to a specific set of models .",
    "we study only models with constant anisotropy , and even among the dfs that generate models with constant anisotropy , we choose a particular set .",
    "realistic systems are unlikely to have a velocity dispersion anisotropy that is independent of radius , and it is not a priori clear whether our results can provide any information on what range of such models could be acceptable .    despite the shortcomings of our analysis , there are reasons to believe that our results may be more robust than they would otherwise seem . in a nutshell ,",
    "our analysis boils down to the fact that the observed grand - total velocity histogram for the cnoc1 sample is close to gaussian , and this is not generally expected for models that have significant velocity anisotropy .",
    "van der marel & franx ( 1993 ) presented a simple method for calculating the gauss - hermite moments for constant-@xmath37 models with various scale - free number densities and potentials .",
    "such models show that the gauss - hermite moments are determined primarily by the overall velocity dispersion anisotropy , and to much smaller extent by the details of the number density profile and potential .",
    "gerhard ( 1993 ) reached the same conclusion for models with varying @xmath37 .",
    "so even though we have parameterized @xmath32 , @xmath5 and @xmath37 in our approach , it is likely that even with a more general non - parametric approach the observations would still imply a velocity distribution that is close to isotropic .",
    "the approach that we have used shares many similarities to that used by merritt & saha ( 1993 ) to interpret 296 measured velocities for the coma cluster . in particular , we follow their approach of maximizing the likelihood for the @xmath0 dataset . like us , they use a restricted parameterization for the mass profile ; while they adopt a two - parameter family for the gravitational potential , we adopt a three - parameter family for the mass density .",
    "the technique of merritt & saha does have two important advantages over our approach : first , it makes a basis function expansion of the df that allows fairly arbitrary anisotropy profiles ; and second , it avoids binning and parameterization of the projected number density profile .",
    "on the other hand , our method expands on that of merritt & saha through the inclusion of explicit modeling of interloper contamination , the monte - carlo simulation of the dataset to estimate confidence regions and the goodness - of - fit , and the use of gauss - hermite moments .",
    "a hybrid version of our techniques would probably allow the most robust conclusions to be reached , but this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "our analysis has included the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) of each of the clusters in the sample .",
    "bcgs have very special properties ; they tend to be atypically bright , and they are generally found at @xmath203 .",
    "so it is not clear whether it is appropriate to treat them on a par with the other cluster members , as we have done .",
    "exclusion of the bcgs from our sample would , among other things , decrease the projected number density @xmath18 at small radii .",
    "specification of @xmath18 is the first step in our modeling approach , so our entire analysis would need to be repeated to determine accurately whether exclusion of the bcg s would alter the results of our dynamical models . to avoid this ,",
    "we have chosen a more approximate route to address this issue .",
    "we removed the bcg s from the sample , and then recalculated the gauss - hermite moments of the observed grand - total velocity histogram .",
    "the bcgs tend to have @xmath204 , so their removal makes the histogram more flat - topped .",
    "we find that @xmath164 and @xmath165 for the resulting sample are in the range @xmath205 and @xmath206 independent of the assumed anisotropy ( which , as in figure  [ f : gauher ] , influences the gauss - hermite moments through the best - fitting interloper fraction @xmath108 ) . as discussed in ",
    "[ ss : discdf ] , the gauss - hermite moments predicted by dynamical models depend primarily on the anisotropy , and to a much lesser extent on the number density profile .",
    "so it may be reasonable to use the theoretical relation between @xmath164 , @xmath165 and anisotropy in figure  [ f : gauher ] , despite the fact that it was derived for a somewhat different @xmath18 .",
    "the observed estimates of @xmath164 and @xmath165 without bcgs then imply best - fitting models that are somewhat more tangentially anisotropic than those derived in  [ s : dfmodels ] , but only by @xmath207 .",
    "this change is small compared to the size of the confidence regions on the best - fitting models .",
    "hence , the inclusion or removal of bcgs has no significant effect on the main conclusions from our analysis .",
    "clusters of galaxies are generally flattened .",
    "the mode of the distribution of projected axial ratios for clusters is @xmath208 , while the mode of the distribution of intrinsic axial ratios is @xmath209 ( de theije , katgert , & van kampen 1995 ) .",

    "the virial theorem for a collisionless system states that @xmath258 , where @xmath1 is the grand - total velocity dispersion of the system , @xmath259 is its mass , and @xmath260 is the gravitational radius ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . to properly scale the data for a homologous set of clusters , one would need to scale all velocities by @xmath1 and all radii by @xmath260 .",
    "however , @xmath261 is defined in terms of the potential energy @xmath262 of the system , which itself depends on the exact radial profile of the mass density ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "this is what we wish to determine , and @xmath260 is therefore not known a priori for individual clusters .",
    "lacking knowledge of @xmath260 , we scaled all radii with @xmath9 when building the cnoc1 ensemble cluster in ",
    "[ s : jeansmodels ] .",
    "one may wonder whether the scaling of the data with @xmath9 may have biased the results of our analysis in some way .",
    "the likely answer is that it hasnt . in ",
    "[ sss : histogram ] we compared model predictions to the grand - total cnoc1 velocity histogram . this histogram is entirely independent of the radial scaling adopted in the construction of the ensemble cluster ; it only depends on the velocity scaling . nonetheless , the results obtained from the grand - total cnoc1 velocity histogram are in good agreement with those obtained from the more complete likelihood analysis , which does depend on the details of the radial scaling adopted in the building of the ensemble cluster .",
    "this indicates that our results are robust , and not particularly sensitive to the adopted radial scaling .",
    "the radii @xmath9 for the cnoc1 clusters were calculated from the relation @xmath263 , where @xmath264 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath93 ( c97b ) . to assess the influence of the radial scaling further we did some tests with ensembles of hypothetical clusters that obey a relation of the form @xmath265 with @xmath266 .",
    "these were then analyzed under the assumption @xmath267 that was made in the analysis of the cnoc1 data .",
    "these tests confirmed that the results of our analysis are not very sensitive to possible errors in the adopted radial scaling , for reasonable values of @xmath268 ( section  3.1 of schaeffer et al .",
    "1993 indicates @xmath269 , so the scaling adopted for the cnoc1 dataset is itself not inconsistent with the data ) .",
    "there is some evidence for the fact that clusters may form a homologous set from the fact that their global properties appear to lie on a fundamental plane , as for elliptical galaxies ( schaeffer et al .",
    "1993 ) . however , it is still quite possible that clusters are in fact not homologous at all .",
    "if so , our results would only ( at best ) be valid in some average sense .",
    "for example , our conclusion that the cnoc1 ensemble cluster is consistent with an isotropic velocity distribution may well be consistent with the ( contrived ) hypothesis that half of the cnoc1 clusters are strongly radially anisotropic and the other half are strongly tangentially anisotropic",
    ".    the possible presence of cluster substructure may be another cause of non - homology .",
    "however , the two clusters in which substructure is most readily apparent , ms 0906 + 11 and ms 1358 + 62 , were excluded from the analysis .",
    "x - ray images for the remaining clusters appear mostly regular , and dynamical and x - ray mass estimates agree well ( lewis et al .",
    "1999 ) ; this argues against significant substructure .",
    "also , the procedure of adding individual clusters together minimizes the effect of any possible substructure in the dynamical analysis .",
    "in the context of the cnoc1 cluster survey , redshifts were obtained for galaxies in 16 clusters at @xmath7@xmath8 , selected on the basis of their x - ray luminosity ( e.g. , c96 ) .",
    "the resulting sample is ideally suited for an analysis of the internal velocity and mass distribution of clusters of galaxies .",
    "previous analyses of this dataset were based on jeans equation models for the projected velocity dispersion profile @xmath4 ( c97b , c ) .",
    "the results of such models always have a strong degeneracy between the mass density profile @xmath5 and the velocity dispersion anisotropy profile @xmath6 , because these two functions of one variable are only constrained by one function of one variable . here",
    "we have attempted to break this degeneracy by analyzing not only @xmath4 , but the full @xmath0 dataset of the cnoc1 cluster survey .",
    "the sample consists of 990 galaxies with @xmath106 and @xmath191 in dimensionless units .    in  [",
    "s : jeansmodels ] we repeated some of the previous jeans modeling , although with a somewhat different approach from that employed by c97b , c .",
    "the results provide an illustration of the degeneracies involved in the modeling , and serve as a useful starting point for a more detailed analysis . in  [ s : dfmodels ] we presented an analysis of the full @xmath0 dataset , using a one - parameter family of models with different constant velocity dispersion anisotropy , each using a different mass density profile @xmath5 and providing the same acceptable fit to @xmath4 .",
    "the best - fit model was sought using a variety of statistics , including the likelihood of the dataset , and the gauss - hermite moments of the grand - total velocity histogram .",
    "the confidence regions and goodness - of - fit for the best - fit model were determined using monte - carlo simulations .",
    "although the results differ slightly depending on which statistic is used , all statistics agree that best - fit model is close to isotropic .",
    "the isotropic model is acceptable at the 1-@xmath1 confidence level for all statistics used . for none of the statistics",
    "does the 1-@xmath1 confidence region extend below @xmath2 , or above @xmath3 .",
    "cosmological @xmath122-body simulations for galaxy clusters generally predict velocity distributions that are isotropic near the center , and that become somewhat radially anisotropic towards @xmath270 ( e.g. , crone et al .",
    "1994 ; cole & lacey 1996 ; ghigna et al .",
    "the maximum radial anisotropy is not large , @xmath271 .",
    "the number density weighted anisotropy over the region sampled by the cnoc1 data is @xmath272 .",
    "although this value is only allowed by our analysis at the 2-@xmath1 level , theory and observations do seem to agree that the velocity distribution of galaxy clusters is not strongly anisotropic .",
    "nfw have argued that dark matter halos have a universal mass density profile characterized by three main parameters : an inner power - law slope @xmath273 ; an outer power - law slope @xmath46 ; and a characteristic scale @xmath40 where the profile changes from its inner to its outer slope , @xmath274@xmath275 in units of @xmath9 ( depending somewhat on the adopted cosmology ; cf .",
    "c97c ) . in our models",
    "we have parameterized the cluster mass density similarly as nfw , but with @xmath41 and @xmath40 as free parameters .",
    "models with different velocity dispersion anisotropy require very different values of @xmath41 and @xmath40 to fit the projected velocity dispersion profile .",
    "only models that are close to isotropic have @xmath276 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ f : massparam ] ) , and our analysis of the full @xmath0 dataset shows that such models are in fact the only ones that provide a statistically acceptable fit to the data . such models have @xmath277 , consistent with the predictions of nfw . for these models",
    "the logarithmic slope of @xmath5 at the last data point ( @xmath72 ) is @xmath278 , so it can not be established whether the mass density slope actually converges to @xmath46 at large radii , as predicted by nfw .",
    "these models have an approximately constant mass - to - number density ratio , by contrast to the strongly anisotropic models that are inconsistent with the data ( cf .",
    "figure  [ f : massparam ] ) .",
    "in  [ ss : uncertainties ] we have discussed a number of possible uncertainties in our analysis , including our treatment of interlopers and bcgs , our use of a restricted one - parameter family of distribution functions , our use of spherical models for what is in reality an ensemble of non - spherical clusters , and our assumption that clusters form a homologous set . the discussions and tests that we have presented on these issues have not provided us with any serious reasons to mistrust our results .",
    "nonetheless , it remains true that there are a number of important approximations in our treatment .",
    "until more detailed models are constructed , it will remain difficult to fully assess all implications of the assumptions in our analysis . possibly the most important caveat in our results",
    "remains the fact that we have studied an ensemble cluster , built by co - adding data from 14 individual clusters under the assumption of homology .",
    "this has the advantage of reducing the influence of substructure and non - sphericity in individual clusters on the final dataset , but if clusters are not a homologous set , then our results will ( at best ) only be valid in an average sense .    to conclude , we have presented evidence that suggests that clusters of galaxies have approximately : ( i ) an isotropic velocity distribution ; ( ii ) a mass density profile as predicted by nfw ; and ( iii ) a mass - to - number density ratio that is constant with radius . at the very least",
    ", it has been shown that these properties are not inconsistent with the cnoc1 survey data .",
    "additional weight is added to these conclusions by the fact that they are consistent with the preliminary results from a weak - lensing study of a set of 10 galaxy clusters with the big throughput camera at ctio .",
    "that study also yields mass density profiles that are well fit by the nfw parameterization and mass - to - light ratios that are approximately constant with radius ( dellantonio et al .",
    "ramirez & de souza ( 1998 ) and ramirez , de souza & schade ( 1999 ) recently presented an alternative method to model cluster velocity histograms .",
    "they studied a total of 21 clusters ( including nine that were observed in the context of the cnoc1 survey ) to constrain the orbital anisotropy of galaxies of different morphological types .",
    "the deviations of the cluster velocity histograms from gaussians were quantified using the higher - order statistic @xmath279 ( this can be viewed as an alternative to using the gauss - hermite moments or kurtosis ) . to interpret the observed values of @xmath280",
    "they were compared to the predictions of a simple kinematical model that assumes that : ( i ) the velocity dispersions @xmath34 , @xmath281 and @xmath282 are constant through the system ; and ( ii ) the velocity distribution is a ( three - dimensional ) gaussian at any point in the system .",
    "these assumptions remove the laws of gravitational dynamics ( both poisson s equation and the collisionless boltzmann equation ) from the problem , as well as any information contained in ( and dependence on ) the galaxy number density profile @xmath32 , the mass - density profile @xmath5 and the projected velocity dispersion profile @xmath4 . instead , the shape of the cluster velocity histogram in these models is a simple unique function of only one parameter , @xmath283",
    ". the assumptions on which these models are based are not generally correct , but ramirez et al",
    ".  argue that they are reasonable and adequate for the problem at hand .",
    "as we will show , this is not actually the case .    the primary shortcoming of the ramirez et al .",
    "models is the assumption of locally gaussian velocity distributions .",
    "this is most easily seen for the case of very tangentially anisotropic models , which have large numbers of galaxies on ( nearly ) circular orbits .",
    "this leads to local velocity distributions that are strongly bimodal , with peaks at plus and minus the local circular velocity .",
    "even after projection , such models often predict velocity distributions with pronounced double peaks ( e.g. , van der marel & franx 1993 ) .",
    "this behavior of real dynamical systems is not reproduced by kinematical models that assume locally gaussian velocity distributions . in such models",
    "the line - of - sight velocity distribution is unimodal everywhere along the line of sight , and hence the same is always true for the projected velocity distribution .",
    "calculations confirm these arguments and quantify the size of the errors that are introduced . as an example , we considered models for the cnoc1 ensemble cluster in which the velocity dispersion profiles @xmath284 and @xmath285 were calculated from the jeans equations ( as in ",
    "[ s : jeansmodels ] ) , but in which the velocity distribution along the line - of - sight at any point in the system was incorrectly assumed to be a gaussian ( with dispersion given by the jeans equations ) , instead of being calculated from a df ( as in  [ s : dfmodels ] ) .",
    "the predicted grand - total velocity histograms were calculated for different values of @xmath283 , and their shapes were quantified through the gauss - hermite moments @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( dashed curves in figure  [ f : gaussassump ] ) .",
    "the results can be compared to those obtained with a self - consistent dynamical model based on a df ( solid curves in the same figure ; same as the predictions in figure  [ f : gauher ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the results obtained with the simplified analysis have little in common with the self - consistent results .",
    "the former always yields histograms that are more centrally peaked than a gaussian ( @xmath172 ) , and only isotropic models produce histograms that are close to gaussian ( @xmath286 ) .",
    "ramirez et al .",
    "find the same general behavior .",
    "by contrast , self - consistent dynamical models predict a smooth transition from flat - topped to centrally - peaked profiles when going from tangential anisotropy to radial anisotropy .",
    "so while the data presented by ramirez et al .",
    "on the velocity histogram shapes for galaxies of different morphological types are very interesting and definitely worth further study , it appears that their kinematical models are insufficient to obtain reliable conclusions about orbital anisotropies .",
