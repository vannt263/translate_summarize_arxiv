    "at least two more ingredients are required : ( a ) a space - time evolution model of the hot and dense system in a - a reactions , which ( in local thermal equilibrium ) provides the thermodynamic parameters ( temperature , chemical potentials ) for the thermal emission rates , as well as blue shifts induced by collective expansion , and ( b ) nonthermal sources , such as primordial drell - yan annihilation , `` corona '' effects or emission after thermal freezeout , which become increasingly important at larger transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) and lower collision centralities .    in this contribution",

    "hadronic approaches to calculate in - medium vector - meson spectral functions are typically based on effective lagrangians with parameters ( masses , coupling constants and vertex formfactors ) adjusted to empirical decay rates ( both hadronic and electromagnetic ) and scattering data ( e.g. , @xmath5 or nuclear photoabsorption ) . the interaction vertices are implemented into a hadronic many - body scheme to calculate selfenergy insertions of the @xmath3-propagator in hot / dense matter , @xmath6^{-1 } \\label{prop}\\ ] ] ( @xmath7 : temperature , @xmath8 : baryon density ) ; @xmath9 accounts for direct interactions of @xmath2 with surrounding mesons and baryons , and @xmath10 for the in - medium pseudoscalar meson cloud ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath2=@xmath3 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively ) .    due to its prime importance for low - mass dilepton emission ( cf .",
    "( [ piem ] ) below ) , many theoretical studies have focused on the @xmath3 meson . a typical result for its spectral function  @xcite",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rho ] , indicating a strong broadening with increasing @xmath7 and @xmath8 and little mass shift .",
    "an important question is whether the parameters of the effective lagrangian ( e.g. , the bare mass , @xmath16 , in eq .",
    "( [ prop ] ) ) depend on @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this requires information beyond the effective - theory level . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a hidden - local - symmetry framework for introducing the @xmath3 meson into a chiral lagrangian has been treated within a renormalization group approach at finite temperature ( pion gas ) . while the hadronic interactions affect the in - medium @xmath3 properties only moderately , a matching of the vector and axialvector correlator to the ( spacelike ) operator product expansion ( involving quark and gluon condensates which decrease with increasing @xmath7 ) requires a @xmath7-dependence of hadronic couplings and bare masses , inducing a dropping @xmath3-mass . on the other hand , based on qcd sum rules in cold nuclear matter ( which also involve an operator product expansion )",
    ", it was shown that the decrease of in - medium quark and gluon condensates can also be satisfied by an increased width of the @xmath3 spectral function  @xcite . the finite - density spectral functions corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig_rho ] are compatible with the qcd sum rule constraints of ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the latter are mostly driven by in - medium 4-quark condensates , @xmath17 , a more accurate determination of these is mandatory to obtain more stringent conclusions on the @xmath2 spectral functions  @xcite .    for the @xmath14 meson ,",
    "hadronic lagrangian calculations predict an appreciable broadening as well ( @xmath18@xmath1950mev at normal nuclear matter density , @xmath20=0.16@xmath21 ) , but reduced masses have also been found  @xcite .",
    "a recent experiment on photoproduction of @xmath14 mesons off nuclei  @xcite has provided evidence for a decreased @xmath14 mass , but an interpretation of the data using an @xmath14 spectral function with 90  mev width seems also viable  @xcite .    finally , @xmath15 mesons are expected to undergo significant broadening in hot and dense matter  @xcite , mostly due to modifications of its kaon cloud .",

    "furthermore , the spectral function after freezeout is not expected to carry the full medium effects anymore . in fig .",
    "[ fig_na60-semi ] we implement these improvements , along with primordial drell - yan annihilation ( dy ) and initial `` corona '' @xmath3 s , and compare to semicentral na60 data . since the new contributions are characterized by rather hard @xmath4 slopes ( large `` effective temperatures '' ) , their significance primarily resides at high @xmath4 .",
    "this is borne out when dividing the mass spectra in @xmath4 bins  @xcite : freezeout / corona @xmath3 s and dy mostly contribute at high @xmath4 leading to fair agreement with experiment , cf .",

    "the good agreement with improved dilepton invariant - mass spectra by na60 at the sps supports the notion of a `` melting '' @xmath3-meson close to the expected phase boundary to the qgp .",
    "the next challenge is to establish rigorous connections to the properties of thermal qcd , especially to chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "there are promising prospects that , using chiral effective models and constraints from lattice qcd , this goal can be achieved by systematic ( and quantitative ) evaluations of weinberg and qcd sum rules , which directly relate axial-/vector spectral functions to chiral order parameters .",
