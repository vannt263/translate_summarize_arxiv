    "already since the end of the nineteenth century studies of stellar kinematics in the solar neighbourhood revealed that the velocity distribution of stars in galactic discs is non - isotropic ( kobold @xcite ) .",
    "an early interpretation by kapteyn ( @xcite ) and eddington ( @xcite ) invoked a superposition of ( isotropic ) stellar streams with different mean velocities , by this creating an anisotropic velocity distribution .",
    "however , an alternative interpretation by schwarzschild ( @xcite ) became the general framework for describing the local velocity distribution of stars of equal age , though a contamination by stellar streams is still considered to be important for a proper analysis of velocity data .",
    "the schwarzschild distribution is based on a single but anisotropic ellipsoidal distribution function .",
    "it is characterized by a gaussian distribution in all three directions @xmath2 ( radial @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 ( tangential @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 ( vertical @xmath7 ) in velocity space , but with different velocity dispersions @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . in general , the velocity distribution is described by a velocity dispersion tensor @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the different coordinate directions , i.e.radial ( @xmath3 ) , azimuthal ( @xmath5 ) and vertical ( @xmath7 ) direction and @xmath14 gives the corresponding velocity .",
    "the bar denotes local averaging over velocity spacewe emphasize that our definition of the velocity dispersion tensor is different from the definition of e.g. kuijken & tremaine ( @xcite ) who do not use a square mark .",
    "hence , our @xmath15 is equivalent to kuijken & tremaine s @xmath16 . .",
    "the principal axes of this tensor form an imaginary surface that is called the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "the principal axes of the velocity ellipsoid need not to be aligned with the coordinate axes . in that case , the vertex deviation @xmath17 ( which is defined as the angle between the direction in velocity space pointing from the sun to the galactic centre and the direction of the @xmath16 major principal axis ) does not vanish .",
    "the general trend for the velocity dispersions is that the radial velocity dispersions are the largest and the vertical velocity dispersions are the smallest among stars of same age and stellar type .",
    "this trend holds when dispersions are averaged locally , i.e.  in the solar neighbourhood ( dehnen & binney @xcite ) , or globally over the entire galactic discs . for instance",
    ", the ratio @xmath18 of the radial , tangential , and vertical stellar velocity dispersions in the disc of ngc  488 is approximately @xmath19 ( gerssen et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the case of stationary , axisymmetric systems and appropriate distribution functions and the @xmath7-component @xmath20 of the angular momentum or those obeying a third integral of motion which is symmetric under a simultaneous change of sign of @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( df ) the velocity ellipsoid",
    "is aligned with the coordinate axes .",
    "if the stellar orbits are nearly circular ( i.e.  with small radial amplitudes with respect to the guiding centre ) , then the oort ratio @xmath23 of tangential versus radial stellar velocity dispersions can be calculated in zero order approximation within the epicyclic theory to be @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the usual oort constants . for a flat rotation curve one",
    "gets @xmath27 .",
    "more realistic axisymmetric distribution functions give first order corrections , which yield values of @xmath28 ( or 0.66 ) for the solar vicinity ( kuijken & tremaine @xcite , hereafter kt91 ) .",
    "clearly , these values exceed those predicted by the epicycle approximation . on the other hand , observations in the milky way ( mw ) give lower ( mean ) values around @xmath29 , which are substantially below the epicycle value @xmath30 ( kerr & lynden - bell @xcite ; ratnatunga & upgren @xcite ) .",
    "the exact reason for this discrepancy is still unknown .",
    "it might stem from a df asymmetric in @xmath31 ( kt91 ) or from invalid assumptions , i.e.  a violation of stationarity or axisymmetry .",
    "additionally , non - vanishing vertex deviations were found in the solar vicinity in many studies ( e.g.  wielen @xcite , mayor @xcite , ratnatunga & upgren @xcite ) .",
    "these vertex deviations could be explained by spiral structures ( mayor @xcite , yuan @xcite ) , by this supporting the importance of non - axisymmetry of the underlying gravitational potential .",
    "moreover , a clear relation between @xmath17 and @xmath8 has been found . for smaller velocity dispersions larger vertex deviations",
    "have been measured , e.g.  for a radial velocity dispersion of about 15 kms@xmath32 one gets a vertex deviation of @xmath33 ( wielen @xcite ) .",
    "a major step in analysing the local stellar velocity space was the astrometric satellite mission hipparcos ( esa @xcite ) .",
    "earlier results concerning the general behaviour of the velocity ellipsoid , e.g.  the dependence of the dispersions or the vertex deviations as a function of @xmath34 were corroborated ( dehnen & binney @xcite , bienaym @xcite , hogg et al .",
    "moreover , the more numerous known proper motions allowed for a detailed mapping of the velocity space in the solar vicinity .",
    "it turned out that the local velocity distribution of stars exhibits a lot of substructure ( dehnen @xcite , alcob & cubarsi @xcite ) .",
    "for example , two major peaks in the velocity distribution were found where the smaller secondary peak is well detached by at least 30 kms@xmath32 from the main peak ( the `` u anomaly '' ) .",
    "dehnen ( @xcite ) attributed this bimodality to the perturbation exerted by the galactic bar assuming that its outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) is close to the sun .",
    "mhlbauer & dehnen ( @xcite ) showed that a central bar can also explain vertex deviations of about 10@xmath35 , and oort ratios below 1/2 .",
    "recent investigations about the influence of the galactic bar on oort s @xmath36 constant corroborated these results and gave stronger limits on the bar s properties ( minchev et al .",
    "minchev & quillen ( @xcite ) showed also that a _",
    "stationary _ spiral can not reproduce the  u anomaly  .",
    "though less likely , an alternative interpretation of the bimodality as a result of _ non - stationary _ spiral arms can not be ruled out completely .    in general , a non - axisymmetric gravitational potential might lead to both , a misalignment of the velocity ellipsoid and an additional correction of the velocity dispersion ratio @xmath37 with respect to the value predicted by the epicycle approximation . in the case of spiral perturbations ,",
    "this conclusion was made e.g.  by mayor ( @xcite , for a review of different mechanisms see kt91 ) and numerically confirmed recently by vorobyov & theis ( @xcite , hereafter vt06 ) . using linear perturbation analysis kt91 studied different discs subject to oscillating perturbations ( like a rotating bar or a spiral ) or subject to a static non - axisymmetric dark matter halo . in the case of large - scale oscillating perturbations",
    "the predicted vertex deviations oscillate , too .",
    "once the axisymmetric background gravitational potential and the pattern speed of the perturbation are fixed , its amplitude depends in a complex way only on the perturbed mean velocity and its spatial gradient . for",
    "a static elliptic potential kuijken & tremaine ( @xcite ) showed that the observed mean kinematic data ( @xmath37 and @xmath17 ) can be explained , if the ellipticity of the disc is about @xmath38 and the sun s location is near to the minor axis of the corresponding potential .",
    "it is remarkable that the correction terms introduced by the non - axisymmetry are negative ( i.e.   in agreement with the observations in the milky way ) , whereas the higher order terms derived from a more realistic axisymmetric df are positive .",
    "similarly , blitz & spergel ( @xcite ) argued for a slowly rotating mildly triaxial galactic potential , resulting in an outward motion of 14 kms@xmath32 of the lsr and a vertex deviation of 10@xmath35 .",
    "however , it is not clear if the non - axisymmetric gravitational field is entirely responsible for the observed vertex deviation .",
    "the existence of moving groups of stars was shown to produce large vertex deviations ( binney & merrifield @xcite ) .",
    "the situation may become even more complicated because moving groups of stars may in turn be caused by the non - axisymmetric gravitational field of spiral arms .",
    "therefore , a detailed numerical study of the vertex deviation in spiral galaxies is necessary .    in this paper , we present the stellar hydrodynamics simulations of linear and non - linear stages of the spiral structure formation in stellar discs by solving numerically the boltzmann moment equations up to second order in the thin - disc approximation .",
    "in contrast to linear stability analyses , we follow the growth of the spiral structure self - consistently .",
    "compared to @xmath39-body simulations , we have the advantage that we can follow the spiral structure formation from a very low perturbation level deeply into the non - linear regime .",
    "the former is usually hardly accessible by self - consistent @xmath39-body simulations due to particle noise .",
    "we study the local evolution of the velocity dispersion tensor in the plane of the disc , which includes the anisotropy ( @xmath37 ) , the ratio of the smallest versus largest principal axes of the stellar velocity ellipsoid , and the vertex deviation ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ method ]",
    "we give a short description of the numerical code . the model galaxy and initial conditions",
    "are described in section  [ initial ] .",
    "the physical explanation for the growth of the spiral structure in our model disc is given in section  [ spiral ] .",
    "the shape and orientation of stellar velocity ellipsoids is studied in section  [ ellipse ] . in section  [ discuss ] we discuss the applicability of the epicycle approximation and possible causes of the vertex deviation in spiral galaxies .",
    "the summary and conclusions are given in section  [ conclude ] .",
    "stars are collisionless objects that move on orbits determined by the large - scale gravitational potential . an exact description of such a system requires the solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation for the distribution function of stars @xmath40 in the phase space ( @xmath41 ) . a general solution of the boltzmann equation , which is defined in a six - dimensional position and momentum phase space , is usually prohibited due to the large computational expense .",
    "however , taking moments of the boltzmann equation in velocity space turns out to yield a set of equations that is numerically tractable .    in our recent paper ( vt06 )",
    "we presented the beads-2d code that is designed to study the dynamics of stellar discs in galaxies .",
    "the beads-2d code is a finite - difference numerical code that solves the boltzmann moment equations up to second order in the thin - disc approximation on a polar grid ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "more specifically , the beads-2d code solves for the stellar surface density @xmath43 , mean radial and tangential stellar velocities @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and stellar velocity dispersion tensor .",
    "the latter includes the squared radial and tangential stellar velocity dispersions @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , and the mixed velocity dispersion @xmath48 .",
    "we close the system of boltzmann moment equations by adopting the zero - heat - flux approximation .",
    "this approximation is equivalent to assuming the absence of any heat transfer in the classic fluid dynamics approach .",
    "the beads-2d code has shown a good agreement with the predictions of linear stability analysis of self - gravitating stellar discs ( e.g.  polyachenko et al .",
    "@xcite , bertin et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the use of the boltzmann moment equation approach allows us to study _ non - isotropic _ stellar systems , in particular , the shape and orientation of stellar velocity ellipsoids within the discs of spiral galaxies .",
    "the beads-2d code directly evolves observable quantities , and it can follow their evolution over many e - folding times starting from arbitrary small perturbations .",
    "these properties make the stellar hydrodynamics approach advantageous over the more common n - body codes which , however , suffer strongly from particle noise . presently , the beads-2d code is limited by its two - dimensionality ( the thin - disc approximation ) but a fully three - dimensional implementation is currently under development .",
    "the interested reader is referred to vt06 for details . in the current simulations ,",
    "the numerical resolution has @xmath49 grid zones that are equally spaced in the @xmath5-direction and logarithmically spaced in the @xmath3-direction .",
    "the inner and outer reflecting boundaries are at 0.2  kpc and 35  kpc , respectively .",
    "we extend the outer computational boundary far enough to ensure a good radial resolution in the region of interest within the inner 20  kpc .",
    "for instance , the radial resolution at 1  kpc and 20  kpc is approximately 10  pc and 150  pc , respectively .",
    "in this paper we study the influence of a spiral gravitational field on the properties of stellar velocity ellipsoids within the disc of a spiral galaxy .",
    "our model galaxy consists of a thin , self - gravitating stellar disc embedded in a static dark matter halo .",
    "the initial surface density of stars is axisymmetric and is distributed exponentially according to @xmath50 with a radial scale length @xmath51 of 4  kpc .",
    "the central surface density @xmath52 is set to @xmath53  pc@xmath54 .",
    "we note that the densities of stellar discs are indeed found to decay exponentially with distance , with a characteristic scale length increasing from @xmath55  kpc for the early type galaxies to @xmath56  kpc in the late type galaxies ( freeman @xcite ) .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath57 of the stellar disc is calculated by @xmath58 this sum is calculated using a fft technique that applies the 2d fourier convolution theorem for polar coordinates ( binney & tremaine @xcite , sect .",
    "2.8 ) .    the initial mean rotational ( tangential ) velocity of stars in the disc",
    "is chosen according to @xmath59^{\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{n_v } } } \\,\\ , .",
    "\\label{vcirc}\\ ] ] the transition radius between the inner region of rigid rotation and a flat rotation in the outer part is given by @xmath60 , which we set to 3  kpc .",
    "the smoothness of the transition is controlled by the parameter @xmath61 , set to 3 .",
    "the velocity at infinity , @xmath62 , is set to 208  km  s@xmath32 .",
    "the resulting rotation curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by the solid line .",
    "the initial mean radial velocity of the stars @xmath63 is set to zero .",
    "the radial component of the velocity dispersion is obtained from the relation @xmath64 for a given value of the toomre parameter @xmath65 . here , @xmath66 is the epicycle frequency .",
    "we assume that throughout most of the disc @xmath65 is constant and equal 1.3 but is steeply increasing with radius at @xmath67  kpc .",
    "the initial radial distribution of @xmath65 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by the dashed line .",
    "the tangential component of the velocity dispersion @xmath9 is determined adopting the epicycle approximation , in which the following relation between @xmath47 and @xmath46 holds ( binney & tremaine @xcite , p.  125 ) : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the circular speed , i.e. the speed of a hypothetical star in a circular orbit determined exclusively by the gravitational potential .",
    "the value of @xmath69 is yet undefined ( since the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo is yet undefined ) and we substitute the circular speed with the initial rotation velocity of stars @xmath70 .",
    "we emphasize that equation  ( [ epic ] ) is valid only for stars on _ nearly circular _ orbits .",
    "we discuss the practical application of the epicycle approximation to spiral galaxies in section  [ epicapprox ] .",
    "the mixed velocity dispersion @xmath48 is initially set to zero .",
    "once the rotation curve and the radial profiles of the stellar surface density and velocity dispersions are fixed , the dark matter halo potential @xmath71 can be derived from the following steady - state momentum equation ( see eq .",
    "( 4 ) in vt06 ) @xmath72",
    "when starting our simulations we add a small random perturbation to the initially axisymmetric surface density distribution of stars .",
    "the relative amplitude of the perturbation in each computational zone is less than or equal to @xmath73 .",
    "since the model stellar disc is characterized by @xmath74 , it becomes vigorously unstable to the growth of non - axisymmetric gravitational instabilities .",
    "we find that the positive density perturbation relative to the initial density distribution in the disc can be a good tracer for the spiral structure .",
    "hence , we define the relative stellar density perturbation as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the initial axisymmetric stellar density distribution in the disc and @xmath77 is the current stellar density distribution .",
    "the positive values of @xmath78 at @xmath79  gyr are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by the red contour lines .",
    "the maximum and minimum contour levels correspond to the relative perturbations of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , and the step is @xmath81 .",
    "the position of corotation at approximately 8.5  kpc is shown by the dashed circle .",
    "the stellar disc has clearly developed a two - armed spiral structure and a central bar .",
    "a movie showing the time development of the spiral structure can be found at http://www.univie.ac.at/theis/swing_vt07.avi .",
    "snapshots from different stages of the evolution have also been presented by vt06 for a similar model stellar disc .    in our numerical simulations , the bar forms within the 4:1 ultraharmonic resonance ( uhr ) , which is located at approximately 4.5  kpc . at the end of the bar ,",
    "a slightly weaker spiral structure emerges almost perpendicularly to the bar .",
    "such transitions of bars to spirals are not uncommon ( e.g.  ngc 1672 or ngc 3513 ) .",
    "radially , our spiral arms reach up to the olr ( @xmath82 15 kpc ) .",
    "azimuthally , they cover an angle of about @xmath83 where they start to fade out .",
    "the strongest gradients in the stellar density are found near the outer ( convex ) edges of the spiral arms .",
    "the pattern speeds of the bar and the spiral structure are identical . based on orbital analysis , kaufmann & contopoulos ( @xcite ) identified the uhr as a transition region between a bar and spiral features for systems characterized by a single pattern speed for both the bar and the spiral .",
    "recently , patsis ( @xcite ) has shown that such a coupling is related to chaotic orbits that resemble for a long time the 4:1-resonance orbital behaviour .",
    "we note that beyound 10  kpc our spiral arms are very tightly wound due to the decreasing pitch angle .",
    "this is in contrast to logarithmic spirals observed in most spiral galaxies .",
    "this inconsistency may be caused by the presence of the olr in our model galaxy where spiral arms tend to converge to a resonant ring .",
    "we also emphasize that the amplitude of the spiral stellar density perturbation is quickly decreasing as one approaches the olr , which makes it difficult to observe the stellar spirals near the olr in real galaxies .",
    "the non - axisymmetric gravitational field of the spiral arms and the bar perturbs stellar orbits . to better illustrate this effect , we plot in fig .  [ fig2 ]",
    "the residual velocity field of stars at @xmath79  gyr .",
    "the residual velocities are obtained by subtracting the initial mean rotation velocities of stars ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) from the current mean velocities .",
    "noticeable large - scale perturbations to the initially axisymmetric flow of stars are seen between the spiral arms and near the bar .",
    "the flow pattern near the convex edges of spiral arms ( and outside corotation ) is particularly interesting .",
    "the non - axisymmetric gravitational field of the spiral arm creates two counterpointed large - scale streams of stars , which merge near the convex edge of the spiral into a narrow retrograde stellar stream . a similar phenomenon , though less apparent ,",
    "is seen near the inner edges of the bar where two merging streams of stars produce a strongly perturbed velocity pattern .",
    "the regions with merging stellar streams occupy only a small portion of the stellar disc .",
    "however , as we will see in the next section , these regions are characterised by the most pronounced influence of the non - axisymmetric gravitational field on the shape and orientation of stellar velocity ellipsoids .    as demonstrated recently in vt06 ,",
    "the most likely physical interpretation for the growth of a spiral structure in our model disc is swing amplification .",
    "amplification occurs when any leading spiral disturbance unwinds into a trailing one due to differential rotation ( goldreich & lyndell - bell @xcite , toomre @xcite , athanassoula @xcite , and others ) .",
    "according to julian & toomre ( @xcite ) , the gain of the swing amplifier in a stellar disc with @xmath84 and a flat rotation curve is the largest when @xmath85 .",
    "the latter quantity is defined as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the circumferential wavelength of an @xmath88-armed spiral disturbance and @xmath89 is the longest unstable wavelength in a cold disc . generally speaking ,",
    "swing amplification is most efficient when @xmath90 . at @xmath91 and @xmath92 ,",
    "the swing amplifier is strongly moderated by local shear and random motion of stars , respectively .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the radial profiles of the @xmath93-parameter for the @xmath94 ( solid line ) , @xmath95 ( dashed line ) , @xmath96 ( dash - dotted line ) , and @xmath97 ( dash - dot - dotted line ) spiral perturbations .",
    "the region of maximum swing amplification is bound by the two horizontal dotted lines .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the @xmath94 perturbations are swing amplified in the inner 5  kpc , whereas the @xmath95 perturbations are swing amplified over a much larger area between 1  kpc and 12  kpc .",
    "consequently , the @xmath95 perturbations are expected to engage more stellar mass into the amplification process than the @xmath94 perturbations .",
    "hence , it is natural to conclude that the @xmath95 density perturbations should grow faster and ultimately surpass the @xmath94 perturbations .",
    "why then does our model stellar disc develop a two - armed global spiral pattern rather than a three - armed or any other multi - armed pattern ?",
    "indeed , higher order perturbations are also swing amplified over a considerable area of the disc , as fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( top panel ) demonstrates .",
    "the answer is that swing amplification needs a feedback mechanism that can constantly feed a disc with leading spiral disturbances .",
    "the trailing short - wavelength disturbances may propagate through the centre and emerge on the other side as leading ones , thus providing a feedback for the swing amplifier .",
    "figure  4 in vt06 and the mentioned movie nicely illustrate this phenomenon .",
    "however , the propagation of stellar disturbances through the disc centre is possible if there is no inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) or if the waves are reflected before reaching the ilr .",
    "a @xmath98-barrier allows for such a reflection of propagating waves ( e.g.  athanassoula @xcite ) but it is absent in the inner region of our model disc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "to determine the position of lindblad resonances @xmath99 , we plot in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the radial profiles of @xmath100 and @xmath101 for the initial axisymmetric stellar disc and two global spiral modes @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the angular velocity of the two - armed global spiral pattern ( see next section ) is determined from both visual and numerical estimates to be @xmath102  km  s@xmath32  kpc@xmath32 .",
    "this value is plotted by the dotted line in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "it is clearly seen that the @xmath95 disturbances have no inner lindblad resonance , @xmath103 at all radii . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath96 disturbances have the inner lindblad resonance near the disc centre , @xmath104 in the inner 2  kpc .",
    "this prevents the @xmath96 ( and any higher order ) disturbances from propagating through the disc centre , which terminates the feedback mechanism for the swing amplifier for these modes .",
    "we find that this mechanism works nicely in stellar discs with other radial configurations of the @xmath93-parameter and pattern angular velocities @xmath105 and can allow for the dominant growth of @xmath94 , @xmath96 , and other higher order global spiral modes .",
    "the results of this study will be presented in a future paper .",
    "despite more exotic means of galactic disc heating there are currently two known mechanisms involving spirals as the heating agents .",
    "these are transient spiral stellar density waves ( e.g. wielen @xcite , carlberg & sellwood @xcite , jenkins & binney @xcite , de simone et al .",
    "@xcite ) and multiple spiral stellar density waves ( minchev & quillen @xcite ) .",
    "the latter mechanism involves two sets of steady state spiral structure moving at different pattern speeds .",
    "we note that a single steady state spiral structure as defined in e.g. lin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) does not heat stellar discs .    in this section ,",
    "we focus on the effect that the non - axisymmetric gravitational field of a swing amplified spiral structure may have on the spatial distribution of stellar velocity dispersions within a stellar disc .",
    "figures  [ fig4]a and [ fig4]b show the spatial distribution of the radial and tangential stellar velocity dispersions , respectively , at @xmath79  gyr .",
    "a two - armed spiral structure and a bar are apparent in the spatial distribution of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . to better illustrate this phenomenon , we plot in figs  [ fig4]c and [ fig4]d the stellar velocity dispersion perturbations relative to their initial values at @xmath106  gyr . more specifically , fig .",

    "figure  [ fig4]d shows the relative perturbations in the tangential velocity dispersion @xmath9 calculated in a similar manner .",
    "the positive and negative perturbations are plotted with the shadows of red and blue , respectively .",
    "the contour lines of the positive stellar density perturbations are shown for convenience .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] clearly demonstrates that the non - axisymmetric gravitational field has a pronounced global influence on the spatial distribution of stellar velocity dispersions in the disc . the most distinctive feature in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is that the positive ( and negative ) relative perturbations in density and both stellar velocity dispersions correlate spatially , suggesting a causal link .",
    "we emphasize that the largest spatial gradients in both velocity dispersions ( and in the stellar surface density ) are found near the outer ( convex ) edges of the spiral arms . as we will see in section  [ epicycle ] , this may cause a severe failure of the epicycle approximation in these regions .",
    "in contrast to gaseous discs , stellar discs are essentially non - isotropic .",
    "this means that the local properties of stars , such as mean velocities , are determined by the velocity dispersion tensor @xmath109 rather than by an isotropic pressure .",
    "the tensor @xmath109 is often non - diagonal in the local coordinate system ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "the principal axes of a diagonalized velocity dispersion tensor form an imaginary ellipsoidal surface that is called the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "the available measurements in the solar vicinity indicate that the ratio @xmath0 of the smallest versus largest principal axes of the stellar velocity ellipsoid in the disc plane does not vary significantly with the @xmath34 colour . according to dehnen & binney ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the axis ratio @xmath111 is approximately @xmath112 for stars with @xmath113 . to avoid confusions",
    ", we note that throughout the paper @xmath114 and @xmath115 are measured in km  s@xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath34 colour of an ensemble of stars may be considered as a rough estimate of their mean age .",
    "a weak sensitivity of the axis ratio @xmath0 to the age of stellar populations is intriguing since the principal axes of velocity ellipsoids ( when considered separately ) are indeed age sensitive and show a noticeable ( a factor of two ) increase along increasing @xmath34 colours ( dehnen & binney @xcite ) .",
    "if the axis ratio @xmath0 is indeed only weakly sensitive to the age of stellar populations , it would be interesting to determine other phenomena that could possibly affect the values of @xmath0 .",
    "in this section , we consider the effect that the non - axisymmetric gravitational field of the spiral arms and the bar may have on the shape of stellar velocity ellipsoids within the disc of our model galaxy .",

    "one of the principal velocity dispersions @xmath114 or @xmath115 becomes much smaller than the other , if the mixed velocity dispersion @xmath48 becomes comparable to the squared radial ( @xmath46 ) and tangential ( @xmath47 ) velocity dispersions .",
    "we will see in the next section that the outer ( convex ) edges of the spiral arms are indeed characterized by large values of @xmath48 and associated vertex deviations .",
    "these large values of the mixed velocity dispersion are most likely caused by the two large - scale ( counterpointed ) streams of stars that merge near the outer edge of the spiral arms into a retrograde narrow stellar stream ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "it is not clear that such streams are a general property of spiral galaxies and high - resolution observation are necessary to confirm their existence .",
    "the ( possible ) existence of regions with abnormally low ratios of @xmath0 can be potentially used to determine the position of _ stellar _ spiral arms .",
    "this task is not trivial since the spiral arms in external galaxies are usually manifested by strong emission from current star formation , which traces the gaseous response to the underlying stellar spiral arms .",
    "there could exist a substantial phase shift between the gaseous and stellar spiral arms .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] indicates that in the inter - arm region @xmath123 , while near the convex edge of the arm @xmath0 can become as low as 0.25 .",
    "such a large difference can be detected .",
    "moreover , our numerical simulations show that a larger contrast is expected for gravitationally more unstable discs .",
    "for instance , in a @xmath124 stellar disc the @xmath0 ratio near the convex edges of spiral arms can become as small as @xmath125 but it stays near @xmath126 in the inter - arm region . on the other hand ,",
    "multi - armed spirals usually show a much smaller contrast in the @xmath0 ratio , possibly due to smaller perturbations to the velocity field of stars .",
    "high - resolution measurements of the stellar velocity ellipsoids in grand - design two - armed spiral galaxies are needed to confirm the existence of abnormally low values of the axis ratio @xmath0 .    finally , it should be stressed that our models are genuine 2d - models . from a higher - order moment analysis cuddeford & binney ( @xcite ) showed that neglecting the @xmath7-motion can lead to a systematic overestimate of @xmath9 and , thus , an overestimate of the oort ratio @xmath127 .",
    "though such 3d - effects will definitely have an impact on the exact oort ratio , the changes are about 20 - 25% ( cf .",
    "e.g.  fig .  2 in cuddeford & binney ) .",
    "therefore , we do not expect them to alter our results qualitatively , i.e.  the large spatial variations of @xmath0 found in our analysis will be kept . in fact , if @xmath47 is smaller than @xmath46 , the ratio @xmath128 should be overestimated in our 2d - models and the mentioned variation should be even larger .",
    "it has long been known from observations that the mixed velocity dispersion within the disc plane is non - zero for stars of many stellar types ( see e.g. dehnen & binney @xcite ) .",
    "the beads-2d code directly evolves the mixed velocity dispersion @xmath48 and is particularly suitable for studying the evolution of @xmath48 in galactic discs .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the map of @xmath48 at @xmath79  gyr .",
    "positive and negative values of @xmath48 are shown with the shadows of red and of blue , respectively .",
    "we emphasize the fact that @xmath48 may be both negative and positive . only the values between @xmath129 and @xmath130 are plotted to emphasize @xmath48 in the outer disc .",
    "it is evident that @xmath48 takes large values near the convex edges of spiral arms and in the inner central region .",
    "for instance , @xmath48 can become as large as @xmath129 near the convex edges of spiral arms and @xmath131 near the disc centre .",
    "the presence of substantially non - zero @xmath48 implies that the axis ratio @xmath0 may become quite different from the ratio @xmath1 of the tangential versus radial velocity dispersions .",
    "the non - zero @xmath48 indicate that the stellar velocity ellipsoids are not aligned along the local coordinate vector @xmath132 ( galactic centre - anticentre direction ) .",
    "the degree of this misalignment is often quantified in terms of a vertex deviation .",
    "a classic definition for the vertex deviation is ( binney & merrifield @xcite , p. 630 ) @xmath133 according to this definition , the vertex deviation takes the values between @xmath134 and @xmath135 . in practice",

    "however , it is not clear which of the two factors is more important .",
    "the situation may become even more complicated , since the moving groups may partly be caused by the non - axisymmetry in the galactic gravitational field . in order to get a better understanding of the origin of the vertex deviation in our simulation , we analyse the correlation of the vertex deviation with different dynamical quantities .",

    "<S> we present a numerical study of the properties of the stellar velocity distribution in stellar discs which have developed a saturated , two - armed spiral structure . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the growth of the spiral structure deeply into the non - linear regime by solving the boltzmann moment equations up to second order . by adopting the thin - disc approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we restrict our study of the stellar velocity distribution to the plane of the stellar disc . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the outer ( convex ) edges of stellar spiral arms are characterized by peculiar properties of the stellar velocity ellipsoids , which make them distinct from most other galactic regions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the ratio @xmath0 of the smallest versus largest principal axes of the stellar velocity ellipsoid can become abnormally small ( as compared to the rest of the disc ) near the outer edges of spiral arms . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the epicycle approximation fails to reproduce the ratio @xmath1 of the tangential versus radial velocity dispersions in these regions . </S>",
    "<S> these peculiar properties of the stellar velocity distribution are caused by large - scale non - circular motions of stars , which in turn are triggered by the non - axisymmetric gravitational field of stellar spiral arms .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the vertex deviation appears to correlate globally with the amplitude of the spiral stellar density perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> however , locally there is no simple correlation between the vertex deviation and the density perturbations . in particular , the local vertex deviation does not correlate with the local gravitational potential and shows only a weak correlation with the local gravitational potential gradient . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the local vertex deviation correlates best with the spatial gradients of mean stellar velocities , in particular with the radial gradient of the mean radial velocity .    </S>",
