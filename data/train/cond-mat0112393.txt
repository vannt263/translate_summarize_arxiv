    "since the observation of bose - einstein condensation in trapped atomic gases @xcite , there has been increasing interest in creating quantum degenerate gases of fermions with trapped ultracold akali atoms . at temperatures below the fermi temperature , @xmath0 ,",
    "the properties of the gas become strongly influenced by the pauli exclusion principle @xcite .",
    "besides exploring the role of quantum statistics in their behavior , much of the interest in these gases has focused on the possibility of achieving the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) phase transition to the superfluid state by forming cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "currently , experimental efforts in cooling of fermionic atoms of @xmath1li @xcite and @xmath2k @xcite to the quantum degenerate regime have made significant progress , reaching temperatures as low as @xmath3 where @xmath0 is the fermi temperature .",
    "however , the efficiency of the evaporative cooling process used to cool a two component fermi gas is severely hindered for temperatures below @xmath0 due to pauli blocking @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the lack of @xmath4-wave scattering between spin - polarized fermions makes evaporative cooling completely ineffective for a single component fermi gas .",
    "furthermore , it has been recently predicted that loss processes which remove particles from the trap and leave holes behind in the single particle distribution also impose a lower limit on the temperature ( @xmath5 ) that can be reached in a pure fermi gas @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the recent experiments that achieved quantum degeneracy in @xmath1li have used @xmath6li , a boson , to sympathetically cool the @xmath1li atoms @xcite .",
    "this procedure is also being applied to cool @xmath2k using @xmath7rb @xcite .",
    "therefore , it appears likely that future experiments on degenerate fermi gases will be associated with a bose gas with a non - negligible boson - fermion two - body interaction . in a more speculative vein",
    ", the nonlinear mixing of bosonic and fermionic matter waves may open up the way to novel methods to manipulate these waves , and in particular their statistical properties .",
    "the theoretical study of the properties of coupled bose - einstein condensates and degenerate fermi gases is therefore of considerable practical interest to future experiments .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to establish a general analysis of the quasiparticle spectrum and dynamical stability for a bec coupled to a degenerate fermi gas .",
    "there have been a number of recent studies of both the ground state properties @xcite and the collective modes for the density fluctuations of the coupled gases @xcite .",
    "these studies have all treated the ground state of the fermions as being that of a normal degenerate fermi gas .",
    "the likelihood of observing the superfluid state in fermionic akali vapors has sparked several theoretical studies of the quasiparticle and collective modes of trapped superfluid fermi gases @xcite .",
    "however , the quasiparticle excitations of a _ coupled _ superfluid fermi gas and bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) has not yet been investigated . in this paper , we examine both the case when the ground state of the fermions , in the absence of a boson - fermion interaction , is the normal state and the bcs superfluid state . in both cases ,",
    "the quasiparticle spectrum exhibits a dynamical instability due to the exchange of energy and momentum with the fermions .",
    "physically , the existence of the instability implies the existence of a lower energy ground state of the coupled system , which involves correlated density fluctuations between the bec and fermi gas . in the stable regime , the quasiparticle dispersion relation for the bosons is significantly modified due to quantum fluctuations in the density of the fermi gas .",
    "more importantly , the stability regime and the quasiparticle dispersion for the bosons is qualitatively different when the fermions are in the bcs state as compared to the normal state .    in terms of current experiments with trapped atomic gases ,",
    "we are only interested in the dilute limit for the bose - fermi mixture . in that limit ,",
    "we can linearize the equations of motion for the density fluctuations of the two gases , since at zero temperature the fluctuations relative to the non - interacting ground state are expected to be small . for the bosons , this method is equivalent , in the absence of a boson - fermion coupling , to the bogoliubov procedure @xcite .",
    "the presence of a boson - fermion coupling results in a modified boson - boson interaction due to the induced density fluctuations in the fermi gas . in sec .",
    "ii , we present our model and derive the quasiparticle spectrum for the bosons when the fermions are in the normal state . in sec .",
    "iii , we show how the calculation of sec .",
    "ii is modified when the fermions are in the bcs state . in the appendix ,",
    "we show how quantum correlations between the densities of the two gases can lower the ground state energy of the mixture .",
    "this paper focuses on the effect that the boson - fermion interaction has on the quasiparticles states of the bose gas .",
    "hence , we neglect the effect of a direct interaction between the fermions in this section . for a spin - polarized fermi gas ,",
    "this is an excellent approximation since @xmath4-wave scattering between two fermions is forbidden and @xmath8-wave scattering is negligible at zero temperature .",
    "however , for the sake of generality , we consider the case of fermions with two hyperfine spin states .",
    "the results of this section can be directly applied to a single component fermi gas @xcite since we assume that the boson - fermion interaction and the single - particle energies of the fermions are independent of the spin . in the next section",
    ", we will generalize these results to the case of @xmath4-wave cooper pairing .",
    "for this purpose , it will be necessary to explicitly include an attractive interaction in order to create a non - zero pairing field needed for the bcs state .",

    "in contrast to ref.@xcite , where the fermionic grating was created optically , or matter - wave superradiance @xcite , where the grating results from the mixing of optical and matter waves , four - wave mixing results now from the coupling between the bosonic and fermionic matter - wave fields .    the procedure we adopt here is to formally integrate eq .",
