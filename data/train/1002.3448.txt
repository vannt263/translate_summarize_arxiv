    "@xcite give an overview of many interesting properties and applications in econometrics .",
    "indeed , these distributions have received a lot of attention among statisticians recently as described in the review by @xcite .",
    "the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator was studied in the univariate setting by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these references contain characterizations of the estimators , consistency results and explicit algorithms .",
    "extensions of one or more of these aspects to the multivariate setting are presented by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite show that multivariate log - concave distributions are a very well - behaved nonparametric class .",
    "for instance , moments of arbitrary order are continuous statistical functionals with respect to weak convergence .",
    "the first aim of the present paper is a deeper understanding of the approximation scheme underlying the maximum likelihood estimator of a log - concave density .",
    "let us put this into a somewhat broader context : let @xmath7 be the empirical distribution of independent random vectors @xmath8 , @xmath9 with distribution @xmath10 on a given open set @xmath11 .",

    "the maximum likelihood estimator of @xmath12 may be written as @xmath15 ( provided this exists and is unique ) . even if @xmath10 fails to have a density within @xmath13 , one may view @xmath16 as an estimator of the approximating density @xmath17 in fact , if @xmath10 has a density @xmath18 on @xmath14 such that the integral @xmath19 exists in @xmath20 , one may rewrite @xmath21 as the minimizer of the kullback ",

    "viewing a maximum likelihood estimator as an estimator of an approximation within a given model is common in statistics [ see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that under suitable regularity conditions on @xmath10 and @xmath13 , the estimator @xmath16 is consistent with certain large deviation bounds or rates of convergence , even in the case of misspecified models . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "their results are not directly applicable in the setting of log - concave densities , which is treated by @xcite .",

    "in addition we show that @xmath49 is convex and upper semicontinuous with respect to weak convergence .",
    "in section [ sec : regression problems ] we apply these results to the following type of regression problem : suppose that we observe independent real random variables @xmath50 , @xmath51 such that @xmath52 for given fixed design points @xmath53 in some set @xmath14 , some unknown regression function @xmath54 and independent , identically distributed random errors @xmath55 with unknown log - concave density @xmath12 and mean zero .",
