    "despite extensive studies , the explosion mechanism of core - collapse supernovae is still elusive . according to the delayed explosion scenario ,",
    "the shock is first stalled at a distance of a few hundred kilometers , and then revived after neutrinos diffuse out of the proto neutron star .",
    "unfortunately , numerical simulations suggest that neutrino heating may not be efficient enough , at least in spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown that the spherical stalled shock is unstable against non radial perturbations with a low degree @xmath2 even if the flow is convectively stable .",
    "this result was demonstrated using axisymmetric numerical simulations @xcite and linear stability analyses @xcite .",
    "some numerical simulations have shown that this hydrodynamical instability , often called sasi , may assist the revival of the shock and trigger a successful explosion , powered either by neutrino heating @xcite or by acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "some observed properties of young neutron stars may also be the consequences of sasi , such as their distribution of velocities @xcite or their spin @xcite .    until now",
    ", most studies of sasi have assumed that the unperturbed flow is purely radial and not rotating .",
    "since the angular momentum of massive stars is likely to be large @xcite , it is desirable to understand how the properties of sasi are affected by rotation . in this letter",
    ", the effect of rotation on the linear stage of sasi is investigated using a perturbative analysis in order to shed light on one of the surprising results observed by @xcite in their 3d numerical simulations : the development of sasi seems to systematically favour a spiral mode rotating in the same direction as the accretion flow . as a consequence of momentum conservation",
    ", this mode diminishes and may even reverse the angular momentum acquired by the proto - neutron star from the stationary flow .",
    "incidentally , the present linear study does not address another surprising result of @xcite , that a spiral mode of sasi always dominate the axisymmetric mode even without rotation .",
    "following an approach similar to @xcite ( hereafter fgsj07 ) , we first compute the eigenfrequencies by solving accurately a boundary value problem between the shock surface and the accretor surface ; in a second step , we use the same wkb method as in fgsj07 to measure the stability of purely acoustic and advective - acoustic cycles in this region .",
    "this approach is different from @xcite , which is based on the approximate derivation of a dispersion relation . rather than the complexity of describing the non - spherical shape of a shock deformed by rotation @xcite , we have chosen , as a first step , to solve the much simpler problem of a cylindrical accretion shock .",
    "this flow is simple enough to allow for a complete coverage of the parameter space and a physical insight of the main effects of rotation on sasi .",
    "once characterized , these effects can be transposed into the more complex geometry of a rotating stellar core .",
    "following a similar desire of simplification , @xcite have limited their 2d simulation domain @xmath3 to the vicinity of the equatorial region @xmath4 of a non - rotating spherical flow , where the poloidal velocity of a symmetric mode is @xmath5 .",
    "their calculation neglected the perturbation of density induced by the term @xmath6 in the equation of continuity , implicitly decoupling the structure of perturbations in the vertical direction from their structure in the equatorial plane . in order to study the effects of rotation in a simple setup and maintain a self consistent set of equations , we have chosen to adopt a cylindrical geometry invariant along the @xmath7-axis of rotation .",
    "the accretor and the shock are thus cylindrical in our toy - model .    except for the geometry of the flow and the presence of rotation ,",

    "the range of rotation rates considered corresponds to @xmath25[hz ] .",
    "we have chosen to compare instability timescales in cylindrical models with different rotation rates but identical shock radii and mass accretion rates , in order to keep geometrical factors constant .",
    "this is made possible by adapting the intensity of cooling accordingly , by a modest amount ( @xmath26 ) over the range of rotation rates considered .",

    "in addition to these equations , we impose the condition that the radial velocity perturbation vanishes at the inner boundary ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the derivations of the basic equations and the boundary conditions are shown in the appendix a.    when rotation is neglected ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) , we remark the formal resemblance between the above formulation and the formulation of fgsj07 describing a spherical flow .",
    "the only difference is the expression for the parameter @xmath46 in eq .",

    ", we also remark that the effect of the centrifugal force @xmath52 on the stationary flow is quadratic , and so is its effect on the entropy perturbation in eq .",

    "the only first order effect of rotation on the differential system satisfied by @xmath53 , is the doppler shift described by @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "given the resemblance of formulations , let us first check that the stability properties of the cylindrical flow without rotation resemble those of the spherical flow studied by fgsj07 despite the different geometry . in the spherical problem , the axisymmetric mode @xmath54 and the spiral modes @xmath55 of a given degree @xmath56 have exactly the same growth rate ( fgsj07 ) . in the cylindrical flow , the spiral modes @xmath55 are also degenerate without rotation .",
    "a numerical resolution of the eigenfrequencies shows that the instability is dominated by the mode @xmath57 if @xmath58 , and by a larger @xmath59 for smaller shock radius , exactly as observed in the spherical flow ( fig .",
    "6 of fgsj07 ) .",
    "the growth rate of the axisymmetric mode ( @xmath54 , @xmath60 ) however , is expected to differ from the spiral modes ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) in a cylindrical flow .",
    "for example if @xmath63 , the most unstable axisymmetric mode is twice as slow as the most unstable spiral mode .    the dependence of the growth rate on the specific angular momentum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the spiral modes @xmath64 in a flow where @xmath63 .",
    "the growth rate of the modes rotating in the same direction as the flow ( @xmath61 ) is increased by rotation , whereas the counter - rotating modes ( @xmath65 ) are stabilized .",
    "the increase of the growth rate is almost proportional to the specific angular momentum . in a rotating flow with",
    "@xmath66 $ ] ( @xmath67 $ ] ) , the growth rate of the fundamental mode @xmath0 is twice its value in a non rotating flow of same size .",
    "the strong effect of rotation on the growth rate of sasi does not seem to depend on the presence of a corotation radius @xmath68 , defined by @xmath69 , also displayed in fig .",
    "we also investigated the effects of rotation on the axisymmetric modes ( @xmath54 ) for various values of the vertical wave number @xmath70 , and found that their growth rates are hardly affected , by less than one percent of @xmath71 in our study ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . a global overview of the parameter space of the cylindrical sasi is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which indicates the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath72 of the most unstable mode for a wide range of shock radii and specific angular momentum .",
    "the asymmetric one - armed spiral mode is unstable in most of the parameter space , and always more unstable than without rotation .",
    "the growth rate of the mode @xmath1 exceeds that of the mode @xmath0 ( by less than @xmath73 in the example of fig .  1 )",
    ", as the specific angular momentum is increased .",
    "as underlined in sect .  3 , the dynamical effect of the centrifugal force on the stationary flow is modest .",
    "we anticipated in sect .  2 that the only linear effect of angular momentum is a doppler shift of the eigenfrequency @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the local rotation frequency .",
    "this leaves the axisymmetric mode @xmath54 unaffected and explains the relative insensitivity of its growth rate with respect to the rotation rate , at least for moderate angular momentum .",
    "the strong effect of rotation on the growth rate of the spiral modes can thus be traced back to this doppler shifted frequency . what is the mechanism of the instability ?",
    "as seen in the previous section , the destabilizing role of rotation does not seem related to the presence or absence of a corotation radius , thus discarding a papaloizou - pringle mechanism @xcite .",
    "two possibilities have been proposed for the mechanism of sasi without rotation ; one is the advective - acoustic mechanism @xcite and the other is the purely acoustic mechanism @xcite . up to now",
    ", there is no satisfactory direct argument for the mechanism of the modes with a long wavelength .",
    "fgsj07 used a wkb approximation to prove that the instability of the modes with a short wavelength is due to an advective - acoustic mechanism and extrapolated this conclusion to the modes with a long wavelength , which are the most unstable .",
    "this method , recalled in appendix  b , is based on the identification of acoustic waves and advected waves at a radius immediately below the shock surface , and the measurement of their coupling coefficients , above this radius due to the shock , and below this radius due to the flow gradients .",
    "these coupling processes are responsible for the existence of two cycles , namely a purely acoustic cycle characterized by an efficiency @xmath76 , and an advective - acoustic cycle characterized by an efficiency @xmath77 .    by using the same method ,",
    "the present study does not address directly the instability mechanism of long wavelength modes .",
    "however , the wkb approximation enables us to describe , in a conclusive manner , the instability mechanism of short wavelength modes affected by rotation .",
    "first we checked that when the shock distance is increased ( @xmath78 ) , the overtones are also unstable and their growth rate is an oscillatory function of the frequency similar to fig .",
    "7 of fgsj07 .",
    "the effect of rotation on the advective - acoustic cycle is illustrated by fig  3 , for the spiral modes @xmath57 corresponding to the @xmath79-th overtone , as a function of the rotation rate .",
    "the cycle efficiency @xmath77 is strongly amplified by rotation if @xmath61 , while strongly damped if @xmath65 .",
    "the stabilization of the counter - rotating spiral coincides with a marginally stable cycle @xmath80 .",
    "the calculation of the amplification factor @xmath76 of perturbations during each purely acoustic cycle indicates its stability ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "contrary to the expectation of @xcite ( see next subsection ) , rotation clearly favours the spiral mode of the advective - acoustic cycle .",
    "this consequence of rotation established unambiguously for short wavelength perturbations is identical to the influence of rotation on the fundamental mode of sasi : we consider this a new hint that the advective - acoustic mechanism can be extrapolated to low frequencies .",
    "the detailed analysis of the consequences of the doppler shifted frequency on the increase of the advective - acoustic efficiency @xmath77 will be presented elsewhere ( @xcite , in preparation ) .      the effect of rotation on the growth rate of sasi , established in sect . 3 in a cylindrical geometry ,",
    "is qualitatively similar to the effect conjectured by @xcite ( hereafter l07 ) .",
    "nevertheless , their investigation about the instability mechanism led them to a different interpretation of the roles of the acoustic and advective - acoustic cycles .",
    "we must point out a fundamental difference between the method of l07 and ours : by using a wkb approximation , we have carefuly defined the range of validity of our method , namely short wavelength modes .",
    "this guarantees that the advective - acoustic interpretation of the instability mechanism is physical and robust , at least in some parameter range .",
    "in contrast , the existence of a purely acoustic instability is still a conjecture because the domain of validity of the method used by l07 is ambiguous : their analytical derivation of a dispersion relation when advection is included requires to neglect terms of order @xmath82 while terms of order @xmath83 are retained .",
    "this approximation is not supported by the results of their fig .  2 , which indicates that @xmath84 is comparable to or larger than @xmath85 for the modes @xmath86 and @xmath87 . an accurate description of this acoustic mode , even in a simplified set up ,",
    "would be useful to gain confidence in its possible existence .",
    "in addition to the question of the validity of the approximations used by l07 , we find that our results invalidate their reasoning concerning the instability mechanism .",
    "they proposed that the advective - acoustic mechanism would be essential if @xmath88 , whereas a purely acoustic unstable process would be dominant for small shock radii , and they argued that rotation is a key ingredient to discriminate between the two mechanisms .",
    "when rotation is included , its effect on sasi has been attributed by l07 to a purely acoustic mechanism , despite the results of their table 3 . however , their view that rotation can not possibly enhance the growth of the advective - acoustic cycle is clearly incorrect , at least for the short wavelength modes ( our fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .      the perturbative study of a simple cylindrical configuration has enabled us to cover a large parameter space of shock radii and rotation rates , in order to ( i ) demonstrate the linear selection of non - axisymmetric modes , ( ii ) establish a correlation between the preferred direction of the spiral sasi and the rotation of the collapsing core , ( iii ) identify the advective - acoustic mechanism at work for short wavelength spiral perturbations .    the fact that rotation favours a spiral mode @xmath89 in a cylindrical flow seems directly connected to the property observed by @xcite in their 3d simulations including rotation .",
    "tracing back the main influence of rotation to the local doppler shifted frequency @xmath90 , we may indeed expect a similar destabilization of the spiral modes with a positive value of @xmath72 , a stabilization of the counter - rotating ones , and a comparatively weak influence on the axisymmetric modes .",
    "even a moderate amount of angular momentum results in a shortening of the growth time of sasi through the destabilization of a non - axisymmetric mode .",
    "the promising consequences of sasi on both the explosion mechanisms and the pulsar kick could thus be considerably modified , since they were established on the basis of axisymmetric numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "our study suggests that the effect of rotation on the linear phase of sasi can be safely neglected only for slowly rotating progenitors with a specific angular momentum @xmath91 @xmath92s .",
    "although a fast growth of sasi might be helpful to an early shock revival , the dynamical effects of a spiral mode @xmath0 , and even @xmath1 , on the possible explosion mechanisms are not known yet .",
    "if the direction of the kick were determined by the geometry of the most unstable @xmath87 sasi mode , our perturbative approach would suggest a kick - spin misalignment .",
    "the strength of the equatorial kick may be diminished by the domination of a symmetric mode @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth noting however that the relationship between the timescale of the most unstable sasi mode and the onset of explosion is not straightforward , and should be evaluated by future 3d numerical simulations .",
    "our linear approach modestly aims at guiding our intuition for the interpretation of these simulations .",

    "<S> a perturbative analysis is used to investigate the effect of rotation on the instability of a steady accretion shock ( sasi ) in a simple toy - model , in view of better understanding supernova explosions in which the collapsing core contains angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> a cylindrical geometry is chosen for the sake of simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> even when the centrifugal force is very small , rotation can have a strong effect on the non - axisymmetric modes of sasi by increasing the growth rate of the spiral modes rotating in the same direction as the steady flow . </S>",
    "<S> counter - rotating spiral modes are significantly damped , while axisymmetric modes are hardly affected by rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the growth rates of spiral modes have a nearly linear dependence on the specific angular momentum of the flow . the fundamental one - armed spiral mode ( @xmath0 ) is favoured for small rotation rates , whereas stronger rotation rates favour the mode @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> a wkb analysis of higher harmonics indicates that the efficiency of the advective - acoustic cycles associated to spiral modes is strongly affected by rotation in the same manner as low frequency modes , whereas the purely acoustic cycles are stable . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the linear phase of sasi in rotating core - collapse supernovae naturally selects a spiral mode rotating in the same direction of the flow , as observed in the 3d numerical simulations of blondin & mezzacappa ( 2007 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this emphasizes the need for a 3d approach of rotating core - collapse , before conclusions on the explosion mechanisms and pulsar kicks can be drawn . </S>"
