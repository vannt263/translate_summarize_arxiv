    "sunspot observations since 1610 have revealed that the sun has an 11-year cyclic magnetic activity , which is modulated on longer time - scales in association with grand minima , such as the maunder minimum ( 1645  1715 ) , when sunspots vanished almost completely from the solar photosphere , and with grand maxima , when the magnetic activity levels are enhanced , such as the modern maximum .",
    "showed that during the recovery phase of the maunder minimum , the sunspot activity displayed a north - south asymmetry where sunspots were mainly observed in the southern solar hemisphere , while sunspots were dominant in the northern solar hemisphere during the dalton minimum @xcite .",
    "furthermore , using historical reconstructions of the butterfly diagram for the period of 17491796 , @xcite provided lines of evidence that the quadrupolar component of the sun s large - scale magnetic field played a dominant role compared to the dipolar one . following this period ,",
    "the north - south asymmetry ceased and the sun s large - scale magnetic field became dipolar again when hale s polarity cycle was obeyed .",
    "information on solar variations prior to 1610 relies on past production rates of cosmogenic nuclides , such as @xmath2be and @xmath0c @xcite .",
    "the production rates of cosmogenic nuclides depend on the intensity with which cosmic rays impinge on the earth s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "however , before reaching the earth , cosmic - ray particles have to travel through the heliosphere @xcite , where they become modulated by the heliospheric magnetic field , which is a component of the sun s large - scale magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the production rates of cosmogenic radionuclides are inversely correlated with solar magnetic activity and the geomagnetic field intensity .",
    "this inverse correlation is caused by the non - linear shielding effect of the solar magnetic field and the geomagnetic dipole field @xcite .",
    "therefore , the flux of galactic cosmic ray ( gcr ) particles reaching earth is inversely proportional to , but out of phase with , the 11-year solar cycle .",
    "temporal variations in the gcr intensity display a distinct 11-year periodicity owing to solar modulation of gcrs by the heliospheric magnetic field component of the large - scale field of the sun in the heliosphere @xcite .",
    "earlier studies based on past production rates of cosmogenic nuclides have shown that the maunder minimum and the modern maximum were not the only quiescent and enhanced activity periods observed over the last @xmath110.000 years .",
    "suggest that during the period from 6600 bc to 1650 ad , the sun experienced 32 grand minima and 21 grand maxima , whereas claimed that the sun underwent 27 grand minima and 19 grand maxima since 8500 bc based on their sunspot number reconstructions .",
    "some specific aspects of the long term variations in amplitude and parity can be reproduced by the current solar / stellar dynamo models .",
    "for example , grand minima are seen as quiescent intervals of activity that interrupt periods of moderate activity levels .",
    "there are at least two ways to reproduce these intermittent periods in solar dynamos ; via sudden changes in the governing parameters of the solar dynamo @xcite or via the back - reaction of the lorentz force on the velocity field , acting as a dynamical non - linearity . in the latter scenario ,",
    "the back reaction of the lorentz force on the velocity flow arising from the magnetic field generated by the solar dynamo is taken into account , which tends to oppose the driving fluid motions through velocity fluctuations , the so - called malkus - proctor effect @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has also been shown to cause amplitude and parity modulation of the sun s large - scale magnetic field .",
    "especially , when the magnetic field is particularly strong , the sun might act as a relaxation oscillator , which forces the solar magnetic activity into a minimum phase after a period of strong activity .    in this study , we look for observational evidences in support of the scenario explained above , whether such a pattern indeed is present in the data as it was suggested that grand minima and maxima occur when the solar dynamo enters a special state .",
    "this implies that the occurrence and nature of grand minima and maxima do not reflect purely random processes without a memory , but there is a memory in the driving process .",
    "the findings might help us interpret the current solar dynamics as observations of solar activity structures , _",
    "e. g. _ sunspots , coronal mass ejections , solar winds , may imply that a period of reduced magnetic activity after the modern maximum could have already started during the descending phase of solar cycle 23 @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , investigate the solar dynamics during the time period from 6600 bc to 1650 ad attempting to identify regular patterns of occurrence in grand minima and maxima .",
    "this categorisation may allow us to classify the recent solar dynamics .",
    "in this study , we use the grand solar minima and maxima periods identified in , who used the grip @xmath2be and intcal13 @xmath0c records for the overlapping period from 6600 bc to 1650 ad to reconstruct the solar modulation potentials ( smps ) and they detected 32 grand minima and 21 grand maxima based on three criteria , _ i. e. _ , ( i ) the amplitude of low and high activity periods have to be above and below threshold values , respectively , which are calculated based on the distributions of overlapping peaks and dips , ( ii ) the durations of these periods have to be longer than two solar cycles , and ( iii ) they have to occur simultaneously in the two reconstructions based on the grip @xmath2be and intcal13 @xmath0c records . using such a method provides a more robust identification of grand minima and grand maxima , since the geochemical behaviour of these two radionuclides are different and their deposition rates can be affected by different processes in the earth system @xcite .",
    "in addition to the list given in , we also included the maunder minimum ( 1645  1715 ad . ) to the list of grand minima , which could not be included in that study because of the time span of the grip @xmath2be record , which extends up to 1650 ad .",
    "it s worth noting that all the numerical results presented here are based on the smp reconstruction calculated by using the intcal13 @xmath0c record , which extends up to 1950 ad .",
    "however , because of the suess effect , which has caused a significant decrease in the @xmath0c/@xmath3c ratio as a consequence of admixture of large amounts of fossil carbon into the atmosphere after the industrial revolution @xcite , we disregarded data after 1820 .",
    "we investigated statistical occurrence characteristics of grand maxima and minima and found that 15 out of 21 grand maxima are followed by a grand minimum ( figure  [ fig : maxminsub]a ) either immediately after or after spending some time in a moderate activity period , meaning that @xmath171@xmath4 of grand maxima are followed by a grand minimum and almost 47% of the grand minima follow a grand maximum .",

    ".the center times and durations of the grand minima , which follow a grand maximum .",

    "sunspot observations have showed that solar cycle 24 is weaker than solar cycle 23 , with peak sunspot numbers almost half the value of solar cycle 23 . additionally , geomagnetic activity levels during the ascending phase of solar cycle 24 were lower than any comparable period during solar cycle 1723 @xcite .",
    "fewer coronal mass ejections have been observed during the ascending phase of solar cycle 24 and they tend to be less massive and slower when compared to solar cycle 23 @xcite .",
    "further , a similar long - term decreasing trend can also be observed in the smp reconstruction by @xcite .",
    "all these observations may imply that the current period of reduced magnetic activity have already started during the descending phase of solar cycle 23 .",
    "in fact , after the first sunspot maximum observed in 1999 , the dynamics of solar cycle 23 was characterised by a prolonged descending phase with a small - amplitude secondary peak @xcite .",
    "together with the prolonged descending phase , a significant reduction was observed in the heliospheric magnetic field and the solar wind speed and density during solar cycle 23 @xcite .",
    "it is thus believed that the modern maximum may have ended with solar cycle 23 in 2000 @xcite .    to investigate whether this steady decreasing trend after @xmath11980 can also be observed in the sun s large - scale dipolar magnetic field , which is linked to the solar activity proxies such as sunspots and solar modulation potential , we used synoptic photospheric magnetic field maps of the radial magnetic field ( b@xmath5 ) obtained from line - of - sight magnetogram observations by the wilcox solar observatory ( wso ) @xcite .    the wso data used in this study span the time period 19762014 , starting with carrington rotation ( cr ) 1642 ( 27 may 1976 ) , and ending with cr  2155 ( 14 october 2014 ) . for each map per cr , we carried out spherical harmonic decomposition of the wso data using the legendre - transform software provided by the pfss ( potential field source surface ) package of solarsoft following the recipe given in @xcite . as a result",
    ", we obtained the total energy of the large - scale dipolar magnetic field of the sun .    the total energy in the sun s large - scale dipolar magnetic field shows a steady decreasing trend after @xmath11985 ( figure  [ fig : dipen ] ) in accordance with the decreasing trends observed in the solar activity proxies @xcite",
    ".      the surface magnetic field of the sun is characterised by the presence of two polar caps , northern and southern solar poles , during the sunspot activity minima .",
    "the northern and southern solar polar caps exhibit opposite polarities and they posses the same polarity of the trailing flux within active regions from the same hemisphere emerged during the preceding sunspot cycle . the @xmath6=1 m=0 component of the sun s large - scale dipolar magnetic field is known to be sensitive to these polar caps and exhibits its maximum energy during sunspot minima . in contrast , @xmath6=1 @xmath7m@xmath7=1 component of the sun s large - scale dipolar magnetic field attains its maximum energy during the sunspot maxima , when active regions on the photosphere contribute energy to @xmath6=1 @xmath7m@xmath7=1 component , which is oriented in the solar equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "after the termination of the maunder minimum , the sun s large scale magnetic field has stayed largely dipolar , which also behaves quiet unexpectedly since the end of the modern maximum .",
    "we thus investigate the @xmath6=1 m=0 and @xmath6=1 @xmath7m@xmath7=1 components of the sun s large - scale dipolar magnetic field to get a deeper insight .    figure  [ fig : axeqdip ] shows the @xmath6=1 m=0 and @xmath6=1 @xmath7m@xmath7=1 components of the solar large - scale dipole magnetic field .",
    "the energy in the @xmath6=1 m=0 component ( top panel of figure  [ fig : axeqdip ] ) attains its maximum energy during the sunspot minimum , while the @xmath6=1 @xmath7m@xmath7=1 component of the large - scale magnetic field displays its maximum energy during the sunspot maximum . as seen in the figure , the @xmath6=1 m=0 and @xmath6=1 @xmath7m@xmath7=1 components of the large - scale dipole magnetic field of the sun",
    "has steadily decreased during solar cycles 2123 .",
    "figure  [ fig : answer ] shows the temporal evolution of the @xmath6=1 m=0 field in log - scale in order to highlight its behaviour during the maximum phases of solar sunspot cycles 2124 .",
    "the deepest minimum of the @xmath6=1 m=0 component over the last three sunspot maxima has been reached during the maximum of solar cycle 24 ( figure  [ fig : answer ] ) and the way it approaches the maximum differs from cycle to cycle . the maximum value reached by the @xmath6=1 m=0 component",
    "does not depend on how deep its minimum is , as solar cycle 21 and 23 had almost comparable values during their minima , but their maximum was different .",
    "in fact , the strength of the @xmath6=1 m=0 component is a combination of three processes ; the total magnetic flux emerging in active regions , the characteristic tilt of this active regions and the meridional flow of the emerging flux and these three different mechanisms are peculiar of each cycle and will determine the strength of the poloidal field of the forthcoming cycle @xcite .",
    "therefore , what could be an important parameter is how fast the @xmath6=1 m=0 component recover itself from its lowest value . in order to get a measure",
    ", we compare the energy in the @xmath6=1 m=0 field to those observed during the previous solar cycles .",
    "in particular , at the current solar cycle , 1.6 years had elapsed since the @xmath6=1 m=0 component was at its minimum .",
    "we then determined the energy in the @xmath6=1 m=0 component for the previous cycles at the time when 1.6 years have elapsed after they reached their lowest values .",
    "the @xmath6=1 m=0 component ( red diamonds in figure  [ fig : answer ] ) had already recovered itself after 1.6 years from its minimum in the previous cycles ( figure  [ fig : answer ] ) .",
    "this finding indicates that over the same amount of time , the @xmath6=1 m=0 field is still very well below the values of previous cycles during the sunspot maximum of cycle 24 .",
    "if the strength of the @xmath6=1 m=0 component keeps increasing , then the time to reach its maximum will be longer than that of solar cycle 21 , 22 and 23 implying only a slow - down .",
    "on the other hand , if the strength does not increase more than the current value , this would imply a weaker solar cycle 25 .",
    "the behaviour of solar magnetic activity as seen in solar modulation potential covering the period between 6600 bc1820 ad has shown that 71% of identified grand maxima are followed by a grand minimum , revealing an interesting pattern that mainly grand maxima are followed by a grand minimum .",
    "this could resemble the behaviour of a relaxation oscillator , which occurs as the result of the dynamical non - linearity induced by the lorentz force . according to @xcite , the dynamo - generated magnetic field",
    "will , in general , produce a lorentz force that will tend to oppose the driving fluid motions through velocity fluctuations , the so - called malkus - proctor effect .",
    "these fluctuations can be observed on the sun as torsional oscillations , patterns of zonal flow bands that migrate toward the equator and poles during the solar cycle @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is expected to reduce the amplitude of differential rotation until the effective dynamo falls back to its critical value , at which point the dynamo again saturates .",
    "this is an interesting scenario , since a slow down in the differential rotation has already been shown during the maunder minimum ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "if the back reaction of the lorentz force is indeed behind the origin of grand minima , it would also imply that these quiescent periods of activity are not the result of a random process , but instead their origin is linked to the driving mechanism of the magnetic field generation , and therefore their occurrences are not expected to be purely random as shown in the previous studies .",
    "this is one of the most important feature that are not reproduced by dynamo models taking into account stochastic noise to generate grand minima @xcite , where the governing parameters of the solar dynamo change randomly .",
    "the back - reaction of the lorentz force has been shown to lead to a variety of behaviours characterising the long - term solar variability , including amplitude and parity modulation .",
    "the latter is of particular interest as strong parity modulation ( switching from dipole to quadrupole magnetic field ) tend to occur when the sun is entering or about to leave a grand minimum state .",
    "previous studies suggested that during the dalton minimum , the sun experienced a north - south asymmetry , where sunspots were dominant in the northern solar hemisphere @xcite , while during the maunder minimum sunspots were mainly observed in the southern solar hemisphere .",
    "therefore , we wonder whether or not an increase in the north south asymmetry could possibly be used as a precursor of a grand minimum state @xcite .",
    "the current solar dynamics show that even though an excess in sunspot activity in the southern solar hemisphere compared to the northern solar hemisphere has been observed @xcite , no magnetic confinement in one of the two hemispheres has been detected . according to these results ,",
    "the sun s large scale magnetic field is mainly dipolar with a minor contribution of the quadrupole family .",
    "additionally , it is observed that the energy in the large - scale dipolar magnetic field of the sun ( figure  [ fig : dipen ] ) and the solar activity indices @xcite show a decreasing trend after the 1980s .",
    "this behaviour resembles the type 2 modulation of the basic 11-year cycle as suggested by , where large changes in magnetic energy and no changes in parity can be observed and the modulation must therefore result from the action of the velocity perturbations .",
    "it is still unclear whether the pattern in which @xmath171% of grand maxima are followed by a grand minimum , will continue after the termination of the modern maximum .",
    "the amplitude of the maximum of solar cycle 24 is comparable to the maximum of solar cycle 14 @xcite and confinement of the sunspot activity in one solar hemisphere due to the quadrupole family is not observed and also the value of the @xmath6=1 m=0 field , although weaker , do not yet show a clear drop compared to previous cycles .",
    "our results imply that the modern maximum has ended with solar cycle 23 and we do not expect solar cycle 25 to be stronger than solar cycle 24 .",
    "therefore , it seems that the sun has entered a period of moderate activity level and that has @xmath123% probability to enter a grand minimum state before 2055 .",
