    "while over 300 exoplanets have now been discovered indirectly via radial velocity , transits , or gravitational lensing , to date only a handful of planets have been directly imaged around a main sequence or pre - main sequence star @xcite .",
    "most other detection methods ( e.g. radial velocity and transit ) are more sensitive to close - in planets than those at greater distance from their stars .",
    "direct imaging is the only method currently capable of detecting planets @xmath710 au from their parent stars .",
    "numerous adaptive optics and space based surveys to directly image young jupiter mass planets in the near - ir @xcite have recently been completed ; these surveys have placed strong statistical limits on extrasolar planet distributions but have produced no planet detections . clearly , directly imaging planets is a nontrivial undertaking  and one that becomes even more difficult for terrestrial planets .",
    "in order to successfully image a planet one must first overcome : 1 ) the huge contrast difference between star and planet ( the very youngest jovian planets will be 10@xmath8 times fainter than their parent star , while a terrestrial planet will be @xmath610@xmath9 times fainter ) .",
    "modern approaches to planet - finding often employ a lyot coronagraph to achieve these contrasts ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) even once the initial star - planet contrast has been achieved , residual superspeckles remain ( from errors in the wavefront due to imperfect optics ) and produce a limiting `` speckle '' noise floor which prevents planet detection .",
    "this is seen both from the ground and space ( e.g. the `` breathing '' effect seen by hst ) .",
    "a number of instrumental speckle suppression techniques have been suggested and implemented on ground base telescopes ( and in testbed scenarios for space based telescopes ) , including azimuthal differential imaging ( aka  adi  or  roll  subtraction ,  see  e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , simultaneous spectral differential imaging ( sdi ,  see  e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , imaging polarimetry @xcite , various methods of focal plane wavefront sensing @xcite , and the use of integrated field spectrographs ( ifs ) to separate speckles ( which modulate with wavelength ) from real companions ( which do not ) @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the possible application of the sdi technique to a space - based telescope platform .    from the ground , the sdi technique has been used after adaptive optics ( ao ) correction to remove residual speckle noise without removing planet light .",
    "sdi has been implemented on the trident device at the cfht @xcite , on the simultaneous differential imager at the vlt and mmt @xcite and , more recently , with a coronagraph , on the near - infrared coronagraphic imager at gemini south @xcite .",
    "sdi attenuates speckle noise by exploiting a spectral feature in the desired target ( previous implementations utilize the 1.6 @xmath1 m methane absorption feature robustly observed in substellar objects cooler than 1400 k ) .",
    "images are taken simultaneously both within and outside the chosen absorption feature .",
    "due to the simultaneity of the observations , the star and the coherent speckle pattern are largely identical in both filters , while a faint companion with that absorption feature is bright in the continuum filter and faint in the absorbed filter . subtracting the absorbed filter image from the continuum filter image",
    "thus removes the starlight and speckle patterns while a real companion with the chosen absorption feature remains in the subtraction image . in other words",
    ", the off - absorption band image acts as an ideal reference point spread function ( henceforth psf ) for the absorption band image . utilizing a signature spectral feature of substellar objects",
    "greatly reduces the number of false positives detected ( e.g. a faint background object , while real , will drop out of the sdi subtraction since it will not have methane absorption ) . from the ground ,",
    "significant attenuation of speckle noise has been achieved with sdi .",
    "for example , @xcite achieved h band contrasts @xmath725000 ( 5 @xmath10 @xmath11f1(1.575 @xmath1 m ) @xmath7 10 mag , @xmath11h @xmath7 10.8 mag for a t6 spectral type ) at a separation of 0.5 \" from the primary star . with this degree of attenuation , it is possible to image ( 5 @xmath10 detection ) a 2 jupiter mass planet at 5 au around a 10 myr m0 star at 10 pc @xcite .",
    "sdi on ground based telescopes provides significant speckle attenuations down to star - planet contrasts of @xmath60.3 - 1@xmath1210@xmath13 . to test the classical sdi technique at contrasts of 10@xmath2 to 10@xmath5 and to determine whether such a technique would be applicable for the detection of terrestrial planets for a possible exoplanet coronagraph , e.g. a terrestrial planet finder mission",
    ", we implemented a similar multiwavelength differential imaging scheme for the high contrast imaging testbed ( henceforth  hcit ,  described  in  detail  in  the  supplemental  material  to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the jet propulsion laboratory .",
    "the hcit combines a band - limited lyot coronagraph with a 32@xmath1232 actuator xinetics deformable mirror in a vacuum environment @xcite to simulate a space telescope in order to test technologies and algorithms for future coronagraph missions .",
    "the hcit has demonstrated extremely high contrasts and very fine wavefront control ; contrasts of 10@xmath9 have been achieved , sufficient to image an earth - like extrasolar planet @xcite .",
    "five 2@xmath14 bandwidth filters were selected near the prominent o@xmath0(a ) absorption feature at 0.762 @xmath1 m ( seen in earth s atmosphere and expected for any terrestrial extrasolar planet with an oxygen atmosphere , @xcite ) with approximate central wavelengths of f1(768 nm ) , f2(784 nm ) , f3(800 nm ) , f4(816 nm ) , and f5(832 nm ) .",
    "exact filter wavelengths and bandwidths are presented in table  [ tab : filtprop ]  however , approximate wavelengths are used to refer to the filters throughout the text .",
    "two sets of images were taken in each filter  a long set , with 90 s exposure time per filter , and a short set , with 5 s exposure time per filter .",
    "the filter set was spaced across a considerable bandwidth in wavelength in order to measure speckle chromatism as a function of wavelength .",
    "the light source used for this experiment is a passively q - switched nd : yag 1060 nm laser .",
    "this laser delivers subnanosecond pulses into a single - mode supercontinuum photonic crystal fiber , producing light with a relatively smooth spectrum from 600 nm to 1600 nm and providing sufficient bandwidth and stability to conduct this experiment @xcite .    for ground based observing with adaptive optics ( ao ) , quasi - static superspeckles due to residual instrumental errors",
    "remain even after ao correction @xcite .",
    "these superspeckles are stable on timescales of minutes to hours . but still vary quickly enough over a typical observation ( 1 - 2  hours ,  see  e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that a reference psf must be built on similar timescales in order to overcome the stochastic speckle noise floor .",
    "( to build this psf , adi uses rotation on the sky to decorrelate speckles from real object , sdi uses wavelength diversity , and imaging polarimetry uses images taken in different polarization states . )",
    "thus , on the ground , simultaneous imaging in several bandwidths is desirable to successfully implement spectral differential imaging ( sdi ) . for space - based observing , however , speckles are stable on much longer timescales of hours to days , making simultaneity of imaging less necessary ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "while proposed instrument designs ( such as those for the terrestrial planet finder and the eclipse mission ) utilize simultaneous imaging via either an integral field unit or dichroic beamslitter , no multispectral backend imager was available at the hcit",
    ".    @xcite demonstrated extreme speckle stability at the hcit during a `` movie experiment '' where 480 individual snapshot images were recorded over a 5 hour period .",
    "they found that the change in speckle contrast in hcit during this period ( where the apparatus was allowed to drift freely ) was @xmath60.1@xmath1210@xmath9 per 5 hours .",
    "this demonstrated speckle stability allowed the current experiment to be conducted non - simultaneously with valid results .",
    "additionally , the use of the same imaging channel avoids non - common path wavefront errors between images and thus allows for a cleaner determination of inherent speckle chromaticity .",
    "the present multi - wavelength differential imaging experiment measures speckle evolution as a function of wavelength and contrast level .",
    "we test whether the ground - based simultaneous spectral differential imaging technique can be generalized to a non - simultaneous spectral differential imaging technique for a space mission .    by using a 5 filter set ,",
    "we can attempt to correct for speckle chromatism using both single differences of images and the double difference technique pioneered by @xcite . since the radial position of the speckle pattern in each filter image is proportional to @xmath15 , the platescale of each image",
    "must be scaled so that the speckles in each filter fall at the same radii despite chromatic differences .",
    "after this scaling , a number of single differences as well as a double difference of images in the f1 through f5 filters are calculated :    @xmath16    @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21    in this document , we discuss preliminary results using the classical sdi data reduction method ( i.e. no fresnel propagation is considered . )",
    "data were acquired in january 2007 .",
    "a series of 5 filter images were acquired at each nominal contrast value ( 10@xmath2 , 10@xmath3 , 10@xmath4 , and 10@xmath5 ) .",
    "high contrasts were achieved via speckle nulling in the f3 800 nm filter .",
    "speckle nulling iteratively removes speckles locally by correcting the wavefront with the deformable mirror .",
    "speckles are `` dialed out '' one by one by programming in the appropriate antispeckle with the deformable mirror @xcite .",
    "the hcit operates at such high contrasts that speckles due to both phase errors and amplitude errors in the wavefront must be corrected .",

    "however , only phase speckles can be dialed into the deformable mirror .",
    "this creates a symmetry issue when removing amplitude speckles @xcite . in the image",
    ", both phase and amplitude speckles will appear as a pair of symmetric point sources around the central psf .",
    "however , when inspected in image plane electric field instead of image amplitude , phase and amplitude speckles appear rather different .",
    "phase speckles are antisymmetric , while amplitude speckles are symmetric . adding the opposite phase speckle on the dm will completely cancel out a phase speckle , but will only cancel out one side of an amplitude speckle .",
    "the other side of the amplitude speckle will be intensified @xcite . in our optical system ,",
    "phase speckles dominate to contrasts of 10@xmath3  up to these contrasts , a symmetric dark hole can be generated @xcite . at contrasts better than 10@xmath3 , speckles are produced by a mix of phase and amplitude aberrations in the wavefront and the dark hole becomes asymmetric .    in this manner , the scattered light producing the speckles can be removed locally , however , the speckle solution is inherently asymmetric ; high contrasts are achieved only in the right - side dark hole region .",

    "[ fig : rogues4 ] )  at a contrast of 10@xmath2 , a slight dark hole is seen on both sides of the image but at contrasts of 10@xmath3 or better when amplitude errors must be taken into account , the dark hole appears only on the right side of the image .",
    "the size of this dark region is determined by the control radius of the deformable mirror , which is in turn determined by the total number of dm actuators and actuator spacing .    once each contrast level was achieved via speckle nulling , two images ( with exposure times of 90 s and 5 s )",
    "were acquired at each of the five filter wavelengths . per - pixel",
    "s / n ratios ( for pixels representative of the average contrast value in the image dark hole ) are presented in tab .",
    "[ tab : sn ] .",
    "the gain of the ccd was 2.5 electrons / dn , with a read noise of 6 electrons / pix rms .",
    "the total noise per pixel is a combination of shot noise and read noise :    @xmath22    we focus on the 90 s dataset , since its signal to noise ratio is considerably higher ( by a factor of @xmath74 ) than that of the 5 s dataset .",
    "unfortunately , significant saturation within the dark hole region ( @xmath65@xmath14 of pixels ) occurred in the 10@xmath2 contrast images .",
    "we display these images since their qualitative features are still of interest but exclude them from further analysis .",
    "some saturation is seen in the 10@xmath3 to 10@xmath5 contrast images , but only far outside the dark hole and comparison regions .",
    "in fact , for these images , only ghost point sources considerably outside the dark hole were saturated .",
    "( these ghost point sources are produced by aliasing outside the control radius of the dm and are 31 @xmath23/d from the occulted star  in other words , far from any analysis region ) .",
    "coronagraph images were bias and dark corrected , but no flat fielding was performed , as the ccd already exhibits a pixel - to - pixel dqe uniformity of better than 1@xmath14 @xcite . since the images in the nulled wavelength are of the highest quality and are the most reliable , the f3 800 nm filter image was used as the `` master '' image ( for adjustment of platescale and alignment purposes ) in this analysis .",
    "fluxes in each wavelength image were converted to the equivalent contrast via the following steps : 1 ) a `` stellar point spread function '' ( henceforth psf ) was derived by by offsetting the coronagraph mask by 144 @xmath1 m to the first maximum in transmission ( in other words , moving the star off the mask ) and taking a 30 @xmath1s snapshot image , 2 ) the `` stellar peak '' was estimated from the snapshot image and scaled to the appropriate peak signal for a 90 s data image , 3 ) each 90 s image was divided by the estimated peak signal to convert to contrast units , and 4 ) each peak signal corrected image was then divided by the analytic attenuation profile of the coronagraph mask ( known to closely match the measured attenuation profile ) to correct for attenuation . for more details on this process , see the supplemental material from @xcite .    since the radial position of the speckle pattern in each filter image is proportional to @xmath23 , the platescale of each image",
    "was scaled to the 800 nm image so that the speckles in each filter fall at the same radii despite chromatic differences .",
    "the exact filter central wavelengths presented in table 1 were used for this scaling . to estimate the resampling noise introduced by wavelength scaling",
    ", we rescaled 20 randomly chosen 40@xmath1260 pixel subimages from within each of the dark holes of the 10@xmath3 , 10@xmath4 , and 10@xmath5 images ( 4 wavelengths @xmath12 3 contrast levels , so 240 subimages total were considered in this analysis ) .",
    "we then calculated the standard deviation in each subimage ( using robust_sigma in idl ) before and after scaling ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively ) .",
    "resampling noise was estimated to be :    @xmath26    we found values for the resampling noise of 3.5 - 6.6@xmath27 , which , even at our best contrasts of 10@xmath5 , are negligible .    finally , each wavelength image was aligned to the 800 nm image using a custom shift - and - subtract alignment algorithm ( alignments are to 0.1 pixel precision , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting aligned images were subtracted from the master 800 nm image .",
    "galleries of each aligned image and the resulting subtraction are presented for each nominal contrast level in fig .",
    "[ fig : rogues1 ] to fig .",
    "[ fig : rogues4 ] .",
    "these images are shown with a logarithmic stretch from contrast levels of 0 to 10@xmath8 .",
    "speckle rms measured in several regions outside the dark hole were reduced by a factor of 5 - 50 after subtraction ( for details on speckle rms / contrast calculations , see section 4 below ) .",
    "two double differences were also calculated and are shown for 10@xmath5 contrast in the dark hole ( same logarithmic stretch , also by nominal contrast level ) in fig .  [ fig : dd4 ] .",
    "to quantify the level of speckle attenuation available through the differential imaging technique both inside and outside the dark hole , we calculated the contrast levels before and after subtraction in two 20@xmath1260 pixel regions of the chip for all our reduced images . contrast ( or more simply , residual speckle rms ) is estimated as the standard deviation over the region , an approach adopted from @xcite .",
    "one major caveat is attached to this approach ",
    "it assumes gaussian statistics , whereas speckles have been shown to follow a rician probability density function @xcite .",
    "using gaussian statistics will seriously overestimate the confidence level of a point source detection @xcite .",
    "however , this approach has been used robustly as a diagnostic of contrast performance @xcite . for this testbed experiment , where we are simply concerned with speckle residuals and not detections of actual point sources , this method is appropriate for our use .",
    "regions used for this analysis are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] . the dark hole region lies at 4 - 9 @xmath23/d from the occulted stellar image while the left - side `` comparison region '' lies 19 - 24 @xmath23/d to the left of the occulted stellar image ( @xmath23/d@xmath284.67 pixels at 785 nm for the hcit , trauger & traub 2007 supplemental material ) .",
    "one major caveat exists regarding our choice of left - side `` comparison region ''  we chose a comparison region outside the control radius of the deformable mirror , since the speckle nulling algorithm adds speckle noise to the left side of the image when removing an amplitude speckle from the right side of the image . before nulling we note that a radial trend in speckle intensity exists  there are more and brighter speckles closer to the center of each image .",
    "thus , the speckle noise within the left - side region is somewhat lower than the pre - null speckle noise in the dark - hole region . for this reason ,",
    "it is not instructive to compare speckle noise between the right and left side regions , but instead to compare the degree of attenuation provided by the differential imaging technique in both of these regions .",
    "contrast information is presented in table 2 and is plotted for the dark hole region as a function of @xmath11@xmath23 from the nulling wavelength ( 800 nm ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] . outside the dark hole ,",
    "the single differences improve contrast by a factor of @xmath66 , meaning that the nsdi method will be highly applicable in moderate ( 10@xmath2  10@xmath4 ) contrast systems without a dm to iteratively remove speckles ( for instance , this technique might be very appropriate to utilize with a coronagraphic jovian planet imager without a dm ) . inside the dark hole",
    ", contrast appears to depend strongly on @xmath29 from the nulling wavelength , especially at higher contrasts . for lower contrast levels , a similar speckle suppression with single subtraction",
    "is also observed within the dark hole . at high contrasts ( 10@xmath4,10@xmath5 ) , however , apparent chromatic variation becomes very important and the speckle pattern appears to decorrelate .",
    "for instance , significantly more speckle noise appears in the 832 nm vs. the 800 nm image , meaning that a subtraction of these two images degrades the achieved contrast relative to the 800 nm image alone . for the same reason",
    ", the double differences do not provide an advantage over the single differences ",
    "contrast inside and outside of the dark hole is not decreased compared to the single differences .",
    "increased speckle noise in the dark hole as image wavelength differs from the nulling wavelength translates to a lower contrast in that image relative to the image at the nulled wavelength .",
    "our multifilter experiment lets us simulate the variation in achieved contrast as a function of wavelength that we would expect within a wideband image .",
    "our filters cover a wavelength range of @xmath680 nm  equivalent to a 10@xmath14 bandwidth filter . at an 800 nm contrast of 10@xmath4",
    ", contrast is degraded by a factor of 1.7 at the red end ( 830.9 nm ) compared to the nulled wavelength ( 798.9 nm ) and contrast is degraded by a factor of 2 at the blue end ( 768.1 nm ) compared to the nulled wavelength . over the entire @xmath680 nm bandwidth , contrast is on average degraded by a factor of 1.5 compared to contrast at the nulled wavelength ( and , hence , the contrast would be degraded by a factor of @xmath61.5@xmath12 over a 10@xmath14 bandwidth filter than over a 2@xmath14 bandwidth filter . ) at the highest contrasts ( 10@xmath5 ) in the 800 nm image , contrast over the entire bandpass is considerably diminished  at the red end ( 830.9 nm ) , contrast is degraded by a factor of 11 compared to the nulled wavelength ( 798.9 nm ) and at the blue end ( 768.1 nm ) , contrast is degraded by a factor of 15 compared to the nulled wavelength . over the entire @xmath680 nm bandwidth ,",
    "contrast is degraded on average by a factor of 7.2 compared to the nulled wavelength .",
