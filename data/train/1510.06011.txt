    "the physics of stellar phenomena such as , gravitational radiation , the synthesis of heavy elements and short gamma ray bursts is closely tied to the emission of neutrinos from black hole ( bh ) accretion disks ( ad ) .",
    "these systems can be one possible outcome from bh - neutron star ( ns ) or ns - ns mergers @xcite . in relation to the synthesis of elements , given the neutron richness of their progenitors , bh - ad are proposed as good candidates for r - process nucleosynthesis @xcite . on the other hand , because of the vast amount of neutrinos emitted , neutrino annhilitation above the bh could provide the conditions needed to trigger gamma ray bursts @xcite .",
    "equally interesting is the possibility of neutrino detection from ads in future and current facilities as has been discussed in several works @xcite .",
    "fully 3d general relativistic simulations are needed to study the implications of the space - time metric and of neutrino cooling on the evolution of bh - ns or ns - ns mergers @xcite .",
    "such simulations have shown that the evolution of the binary mergers depends on the initial binary parameters @xcite .",
    "in particular , in bh - ns mergers the bh spin and its alignment characterize the accretion onto the bh @xcite .",
    "these simulations offer an important benchmark for predictions of neutrino energies and luminosities at infinity .",
    "they are , however , computationally demanding making simpler models and post - processing good alternatives for further studies of neutrino properties .",
    "good efforts have been devoted to studying bh - ad in the kerr metric ( suitable for spinning bhs ) and in the schwarzschild metric ( adequate for non - spinning bhs ) .",
    "some works have studied the structure of neutrino cooled disks accreting into rotating bhs , @xcite , and find higher neutrino fluxes than those obtained from their non - rotating counterparts .",
    "other studies focus on the neutrino annihilation rates and find that the deposition energy from neutrino - antineutrino annihilation is larger for spinning bhs @xcite .",
    "harikae et al @xcite also found considerable changes in the deposition rates when general relativistic effects were considered for neutrinos emitted in a long - term collapsar simulation .",
    "however , the dependence of observable properties , such as neutrino energies and event counts , among others , on bh spin has remained unexplored .",
    "neutrinos in the free streaming regime , i.e. once they have decoupled from the disk matter , can reach an observation ( or absorption ) point .",
    "the neutrino properties , e.g. fluxes , energies , and luminosities , observed at the point of emission will be different from the ones registered by an observer positioned anywhere else .",
    "the observed quantities change due to neutrino oscillations @xcite , neutrino interactions , and the gravitational field of the bh . for the latter ,",
    "the consideration of the 3d geometry of the source is of particular importance , as the relativistic effects ( bending of neutrino trajectories and energy shifts ) depend on the space - time curvature . in previous works @xcite ,",
    "we have studied the influence of gravity on the emission of neutrinos and the production of heavy elements in outflows emerging from bh - ad via a post - processing of merger simulations and following neutrino trajectories in strong gravity .",
    "here we extend our study of the neutrino properties by considering the influence of the bh spin and the observer s location .",
    "we gain further understanding on the structure of the neutrino surface and its correlation to the bh rotation .",
    "we provide estimates of electron antineutrino detection rates , counts and signal duration at superk @xcite for a variety of ad models .",
    "we also discuss angular dependencies of neutrino properties : as the polar inclination of the observer changes , the bending of the neutrino trajectories and energy shifts will be affected .",
    "if the gravitational field is strong the curved trajectories allow detection of neutrinos emitted from regions of the neutrino spheres that would be inaccesible otherwise . in section [ diskmodel ] we discuss the models considered , in section [ surfaces ] we study the influence of the bh spin on the structure of the neutrino surfaces , in section [ distantobservation ] we show our results for an observer at infinity , and in section [ angulardependence ] we consider a distant observer at different inclinations .",
    "finally we motive further work and conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "due to the expensive computational cost of fully relativistic 3d simulations of collapsars and binary mergers it is worth trying out other approaches to gain physical insight . in this paper",
    "we use two different disk models .",
    "the first one describes a fully general relativistic steady state disk as in @xcite .",
    "the second one is a two dimensional time - dependent hydrodynamical simulation of a torus with a pseudo - relativistic potential @xcite .    in the first case we extend to 3d the one dimensional model from chen and belobodorov @xcite , by estimating the vertical structure using a simple hydrostatic model that assumes that the gas forming the disk is at equilibrium under the gas and radiation pressure .",
    "furthermore we assume axisymmetry .",
    "the model is hydrodynamical and uses the kerr metric to account for two values of the bh spin @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the total angular momentum and @xmath2 the bh mass ) .",
    "we label these models according to the bh spin : `` c0 '' for @xmath3 and `` ca '' for @xmath4 .",
    "the mass of the bh is 3@xmath5 and the accretion rate @xmath6 is constant .    in the second model , from just et al @xcite",
    ", the simulation is set up to be the equilibrium configuration of a constant angular momentum axisymmetric torus that emulates the final stages of compact binary mergers .",
    "the bh mass is 3@xmath5 and the bh spins are @xmath3 and @xmath7 .",
    "we refer to these tori as j0 and ja , respectively .",
    "the simulation is newtonian and the gravitational effects of the bh are introduced via a modified newtonian potential which is an extension of the paczynski - wiita potential @xcite to rotating bhs @xcite .",
    "this reproduces the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit in the kerr metric .",
    "the structure of the torus evolves in time . to study the effects of the bh spin on the neutrino surfaces we use a @xmath8 ms snapshot , when presumably the neutrino fluxes are the largest @xcite .",
    "the neutrino surfaces , analogous to the neutrino spheres of a protoneutron star ( pns ) from a core collapse supernovae , are defined by the points above the equatorial plane where neutrinos decouple from the accretion torus .",
    "this happens when the neutrino depth @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 depends on the neutrino opacity which is governed by the different scattering processes that neutrinos undergo as they diffuse through the torus . as matter",
    "is accreted into the bh it becomes hotter and nuclei dissociate .",
    "therefore , we consider neutrino scattering from protons , neutrons and electrons . for scattering from neutrons and protons we have the charged current processes @xmath11 @xmath12 and the neutral current processes @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we also consider elastic scattering from electrons and neutrino - antineutrino annihilation .",
    "the charged current reactions affect only electron ( anti)neutrinos while the other processes affect all neutrino flavors .",
    "as tau and muon neutrinos scatter through the same processes we label these flavors as @xmath15 .",
    "we find proton and neutron number densities assuming charge neutrality @xmath16 , and the electron number density assuming equilibrium of thermal electrons and positrons with radiation .",
    "details on the cross sections of the above reactions and on the optical depth calculation can be found in ref .",
    "we obtain thermally averaged cross sections by assuming a fermi - dirac distribution for the neutrinos with a temperature equal to the local torus temperature and zero chemical potential , @xmath17 with @xmath18 the neutrino flux written in terms of the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath19 , @xmath20 this procedure removes the energy dependence of the neutrino surface , as our results have been properly energy weighted .",
    "note , however , that the scattering neutrino surfaces differ from the effective neutrino surfaces ( see e.g. @xcite ) , with the difference being larger for tau / muon neutrinos .",
    "figure [ nut ] shows a quarter of the electron neutrino and electron antineutrino surfaces corresponding to the ca model ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath21/s .",
    "the color scale represents the neutrino temperatures .",
    "the hotter neutrinos ( yellow ) are emitted closer to the bh .",
    "these will have the biggest contribution to the net neutrino fluxes .",
    "tau / muon neutrino surfaces , not shown for clarity , are the hottest ( @xmath22 mev ) , followed by the electron antineutrino surfaces ( @xmath23 mev ) .",
    "the coolest are the electron neutrino surfaces which are the farthest from the bh ( @xmath24 8 mev ) .",
    "this is similar to the flavor hierarchy found in the pns neutrino spheres , and can be understood in terms of the reactions eqs .",
    "[ nut ] and 2 . since the torus is abundant in neutrons , electron neutrino absorption on them , eq .",
    "[ nuabsorption ] , will have a more substantial effect on the mean free path than electron antineutrino absorption on protons , eq .",

    "@xmath15 lack these charged current processes and decouple closest to the bh where the temperatures are higher .",
    "the geometry and temperatures of the neutrino surfaces for these tori are however different from those of a pns . in the torus , near the bh , due to the gravitational potential ,",
    "the accreted matter forms a funnel with lower densities .",
    "closer to the bh there is an increment of the temperature , as matter radiates energy when falling to the bh .",
    "the emitted neutrinos move through this less dense medium for a shorter time , producing higher temperatures compared to a pns . in the pns ,",
    "neutrinos diffuse through a denser medium as compared to a bh - ad , and decouple at lower temperatures ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 mev ) @xcite .",
    "[ spin1d ] shows a transversal cut of the electron antineutrino surfaces for the two models used here : chen - beloborodov with @xmath21/s ( dotted lines ) and just et al ( solid lines ) . for each model",
    "we find the electron antineutrino surfaces for two different spin parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath4 corresponding to the c0 and ca models , respectively , and @xmath28 for j0(ja ) models . in both sets of models ,",
    "the taller surfaces correspond to the higher spin values .",
    "the color scale represents the temperature @xmath29 at the decoupling points .",

    "similarly for the ja model @xmath30 maximum is 7 mev while for j0 the highest value is around 6 mev .",
    "the bh spin also affects the extension of the disk ; the higher the spin the larger the neutrino surface of the torus .",
    "this , as we explain later , impacts the neutrino luminosities and detection rates .",
    "hotter neutrino surfaces for larger spins @xmath31 are a consequence of the spacetime geometry .",
    "matter rotating around a bh will release energy before plunging into it .",
    "the radius of the marginally stable circular orbit @xmath32 , also known as the innermost stable circular orbit or isco , is the smallest circle along which free particles may stably orbit around a bh . the binding energy that can be released increases as @xmath32 decreases , and @xmath32 decreases with the increment of the bh spin @xcite .",
    "when the angular momentum per unit mass exceeds @xmath32 centrifugal forces will be significant and the matter will circulate around the bh .",
    "the extra angular momentum will be carried away by viscous stress .",
    "the viscous heating can then be converted to neutrino luminosity .",
    "the extension of the neutrino surfaces is also linked to space - time geometry . in kerr bhs matter",
    "is hotter and denser when compared to schwarzschild bhs .",
    "neutrinos scatter in this denser medium taking , therefore , a larger distance to decouple which is reflected in larger neutrino surfaces .",
    "using our results for the neutrino surfaces , and following a similar methodology as in refs .",

    "the distances appear stretched roughly by a factor of @xmath49 , changing the areas accordingly . putting this together we have    @xmath50    @xmath51    and @xmath52    the number of neutrinos reaching a detector per second @xmath53",
    "is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of targets in the detector , @xmath56 are the neutrino energies registered , and @xmath57 is the detector s neutrino cross section .",
    "the effective flux @xmath58 reaching the detector is    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the solid angle that the torus subtends as seen by an observer at the detection point , i.e. @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 are spherical coordinates in the observer s sky .",
    "we are interested in a distant observer .",
    "for this situation , the effective fluxes ( eq . [ effflux ] ) will be strongly influenced by the energy shifts , while the effects of bending of trajectories , reflected in @xmath64 , are smaller .",
    "we calculate the energy shifts in the kerr metric . for the solid angle ,",
    "we follow the null geodesics that travel away from the neutrino surfaces in the schwarzschild metric , in order to ease the calculation without compromising our conclusions . note that if we were interested in an observer that was closer to the bh , a calculation in the kerr metric would be optimal , as null geodesics in the kerr metric",
    "would lead to larger torus areas , seen by the observer . for a closer observer estimates of the apparent areas in the schwarzschild metric",
    "would be an underestimate as compared with those obtained in the full kerr metric .    for an observer located at infinity , and in the schwarzschild metric , it suffices to estimate the effect of bending of trajectories by calculating @xmath65 , where @xmath66 , the neutrino s impact parameter , is @xmath67 @xmath68 is the schwarzschild radius and @xmath69 is the closest distance of the neutrino trajectory to the bh . for a trajectory that goes to infinity",

    "we estimate the number of neutrinos per second that could be detected in superk assuming 32 ktons of fiducial volume , with a threshold energy @xmath73 mev @xcite . here the cross section in eq .",

    "it is interesting to note that a pns would produce about 1000 counts / s in superk and has a neutrino luminosity of  @xmath76 ergs / s @xcite .",

    "however , we address the differences between the results found in table [ energytable ] . although the luminosities are larger for the c0 vs the j0 models , the neutrino energies are lower .",
    "the same behavior is observed between the ca and ja tori .",
    "the differences can be understood in terms of the dependency of the neutrino temperatures with distance to the bh , and the extension of the neutrino surfaces .",
    "close to the bh , where most neutrinos are emitted , the temperatures of c0 and j0 models are similar @xmath785 mev ( as is also the case for ca and ja where t is around tens of mev ) . however , the surfaces are much larger for the chen - belobodorov models when compared to the just et al . ones .",
    "this leads to larger luminosities for c0(ca ) despite the higher temperatures of j0(ja ) .",
    "finally , neutrinos emitted farther from the bh contribute to the spectra with lower energies explaining the smaller average energies found for c0(ca ) compared to j0(ja ) .",
    "a broader picture of the accretion tori can be achieved by placing our post - processed results in context with those coming directly from fully relativistic simulations .",
    "recent simulations of the long - term evolution of bh - ns mergers with an initial bh spin @xmath79 and mass ratio of 4 showed the formation of a thick disk of @xmath80 and an accretion rate of @xmath81s @xcite .",

    "the neutrino energies , averaged over time , are 12 and 15 mev for electron neutrinos and antineutrinos , respectively , decreasing at a rate of 1 mev per 10ms .",
    "these are about 1 mev larger compared to our spinning bh results of 11 and 13.4 mev ( ja model ) and larger by about 5 and 3 mev for electron neutrinos and antineutrinos , respectively , for the ca model .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite neutrino cooling followed a leakage scheme which neglects neutrino absorption . with an improved neutrino cooling scheme that uses an energy - integrated version of the moment formalism",
    "f , foucart et al @xcite studied the post - merger evolution of a bh - ns binary , focusing on the stage between disk formation and an achievement of a quasi - equilibrum phase .",
    "their merger results in a disk of @xmath84 and a bh of @xmath85 with spin 0.87 . in this case",
    "the luminosities are around @xmath86 erg / s for electron neutrinos ( the leakage scheme predicted luminosities 30% larger ) , @xmath87 erg / s for electron antineutrinos , while the leakage scheme led to estimated energies of 11 - 13 mev for electron neutrinos and 14 - 15 mev for antineutrinos .",
    "our results for neutrino luminosities and energies for the spinning models in table [ energytable ] ( in particular for the ja model ) , are similar to those coming directly from the cited simulations despite the fact that the initial conditions are different as well as are the neutrino and gravity treatments .",
    "this comparison is useful to roughly check our results and shows that our ray - tracing technique is a reasonable tool for predicting neutrino related quantities via post - processing studies .      to estimate the total number of counts at superk we multiply the rates ( obtained as eq .",
    "[ rates ] ) by the duration of the signal .",
    "this time can be calculated as the ratio of the energy emitted in the form of neutrinos @xmath88 to the total neutrino luminosity @xmath89 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath88 depends on the efficiency of converting gravitational energy to neutrino energy @xmath90 , and so @xmath91 .",
    "the gravitational energy is the rest mass energy @xmath92 with @xmath93 the torus mass .",
    "we estimate the total number of counts for a collection of fully relativistic steady state tori , similar to the c models above , with different accretion rates . for these models",
    "the viscosity parameter is @xmath94 , the bh mass is 3@xmath5 , and the bh spin takes the values @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "we estimate @xmath95 in two ways . for the first , we assume radial accretion , where @xmath96 and then @xmath97 .",
    "the second estimate accounts for the fact that the accreted matter carries angular momentum and therefore the efficiency depends on the bh spin .",
    "then the efficiency @xmath95 is @xmath98 with @xmath99 and corresponds to the amount of energy radiated by matter reaching the bh through a series of almost circular orbits .",
    "@xmath98 is the maximum of binding energy at the marginally stable circular orbit which has a radius @xmath100 .",
    "thus for a bh of 3 @xmath5 with a spin @xmath3 we find @xmath101 km and an efficiency @xmath102 .",
    "for the spinning bh with @xmath4 , the efficiency is @xmath103 while @xmath104 km .",
    "these values are replaced in @xmath105 .",
    "additionally , we take into account the time dilation occurring in the vicinity of the bh and our time interval as seen at earth is @xmath106 , where this redshift is an estimate taken from the overall redshift between the average observed and emitted neutrino energies .",
    "our results predict signals lasting @xmath107 to @xmath108 secs for @xmath3 , and @xmath109 to @xmath110 sec for @xmath4 ( the estimate for a supernova ( sn ) is 10 sec ) .",
    "figure [ events ] shows the total number of counts in superk for these tori as a function of the accretion rate @xmath6 .",
    "the magenta band corresponds to @xmath4 while the grey one to @xmath3 .",
    "the bands for a fixed value of @xmath31 are obtained by using our two efficiency estimates .",
    "the lower limit corresponds to spherical accretion while the upper limit to the spin dependent efficiency .",
    "the total events from rapidly accreting tori is larger because these tori are more massive and so there is more material to be converted in neutrino energy",
    ". the number of counts can be about an order of magnitude higher for spinning bhs than non - rotating bhs in the case of @xmath111 .",
    "however this difference is less evident as the accretion rate grows .",
    "this is because the efficiency calculated in our first estimate decreases faster with the accretion rate whereas the efficiency in the second estimate is constant for all rates .",
    "therefore the corresponding signal duration for @xmath3 in the optimistic case will eventually be similar to the pessimistic @xmath4 case .",
    "if the accretion rate is low @xmath112/sec then we predict a number of counts close to the current sn estimates ( @xmath788000 ) for a spinning bh and roughly half of the sn events for a non - spinning bh . for higher accretion rates @xmath113/sec we could have as much as four times the number of events of a sn in the most optimistic scenario .",
    "the predictions for the just et al model are similar to some extent . as",
    "this model is time dependent , we find the accretion mass rate by calculating the total mass of the torus at two different snapshots @xmath8 ms and @xmath114 ms so we get @xmath115/s .",
    "the initial total mass of the torus is @xmath116 @xcite",
    ". then @xmath117 sec . with the rates reported in table [ energytable ]",
    "this implies a total number of counts of @xmath118 for a bh spin @xmath3 and @xmath119 when @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "using an efficiency of @xmath102 when @xmath3 and @xmath120 for @xmath7 we find @xmath121 sec for both spin values .",
    "this results in a total number of counts of 34900 and 55200 for @xmath3 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "so far we have considered the detection point to be at 10 kpc on the @xmath74-axis , perpendicular to the equatorial plane of the axisymmetric torus . however , given the mass distribution of the accreted matter it is natural to expect that neutrino fluxes , rates and any other quantity related to them will change according to the observer s inclination . from one side ,",
    "the inclination changes the measured solid angle in the observer s sky .",
    "furthermore , neutrinos bend their trajectories due to strong gravity , and regions of the neutrino surface that are invisible in newtonian gravity could be detected in curved space .",
    "on the other hand , some neutrinos that could reach the observer , thanks to the gravitational lensing , can be re - absorbed if on their path to the observer they enter an opaque region . to address these points we locate the observer at @xmath122 km away from the bh .",
    "this is a reasonable distance that once re - scaled to 10 kpc roughly reproduces the rates found above ; it is far enough for our treatment of the geodesics in the schwarzschild metric still to be valid , but close enough to allow us study the effect that the inclination has on the solid angle apparent to the observer .",
    "a direct calculation at 10 kpc will not shed light on the intricacies of the apparent solid angle @xmath123 .",

    "the integration of this equation goes from the emission points on the neutrino surface @xmath129 to the observation point @xmath130 .",
    "once @xmath66 is found then @xmath62 ( and the solid angle ) is given by @xmath131 neutrinos emitted from a particular point could travel around the bh several times : a neutrino emitted close to the bh can fall into it , reach the exterior with some deflection ( first order image ) , or rotate around the bh spending more time near the horizon and finally escape to reach the observer ( higher order image ) . in this study",
    "we limit ourselves to first order images .",
    "higher orders will also contribute , though the contribution is expected to be subdominant for distant observers and for the bh mass considered here ( not the case , however , for massive bhs and closer observers @xcite ) .    as mentioned above , after neutrinos have left the neutrino surface they can pass again through an optically thick region on their way to the observer .",
    "the apparent solid angle is then not only affected by gravitational lensing but also by neutrino interactions with matter . to study the effect on neutrino fluxes due to changes in the apparent solid angle",
    "only we assume the torus is optically thin . by this",
    "we mean : once the neutrinos have decoupled from the optically thick region ( at the neutrino surface ) , they do not re - encounter thick regions . in such case",

    "this provides us with upper limits of our estimates .",
    "we contrast these results with two totally thick disks : one as seen by an observer on the @xmath74-axis ( upper half torus , @xmath132 ) ; and one where the observer is located on the @xmath133 plane , noted by the red dot ( not to scale ) , who will detect the grey surface ( roughly half right torus ) which starts at largest distance in the @xmath74-axis of the neutrino surface , see figure [ thickscketch ] . for both thick tori",

    "are emitted everywhere from the neutrino surface , enhancing the fluxes .",
    "furthermore neutrinos emitted from the opposite half of the neutrino surface can also reach the observer due to strong deflection with lower chances of being reabsorbed ( their geodesics do not cross the highest density regions ) .",
    "additionally at this angle , the doppler effect overcompensates the gravitational redshift , due to the angular velocity carried by the disk .",
    "the final result are the larger fluxes at higher energies described by the thin blue dashed line .    , and polar inclinations of @xmath134 and 90@xmath137 .",
    "the torus model is the steady - state ca with a spin @xmath31=0.95 and accretion rate 5@xmath5/s .",
    "thin lines correspond to neutrino transparent tori while thick lines to opaque ones.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    based on fluxes obtained at different inclinations , with respect to the @xmath74-axis , we estimate electron antineutrino average energies , luminosities and detection rates at superk .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5 , for a torus of accretion rate 5@xmath5/s and for bh spins @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( c0 and ca models ) .",
    "the quantities are calculated at 5000 km from the bh and the detection rates have been rescaled to 10kpc .",
    "red lines correspond to a bh with spin @xmath4 ( indicated with @xmath31 in the legend ) , while estimates corresponding to a bh with zero spin are represented by black lines . if the torus is neutrino transparent ( i.e. assuming they do nt re - encounter an optically thick region after they leave the neutrino surface ) the full neutrino surface is considered and the results are represented by solid thin lines .",
    "we contrast these results by considering emission of the upper half only , i.e. above the equatorial plane , of the neutrino surface ( dotted - dashed thick lines ) .     at superk as function of the inclination of the observer with respect to the @xmath74-axis .",
    "the observer is at 5000 km from a bh of @xmath77 and the torus accretion rate is 5@xmath5/s .",
    "the rates @xmath53 are rescaled at 10 kpc .",
    "red and black lines correspond to spins @xmath4 and @xmath138 respectively .",
    "solid lines assume the tori are neutrino transparent while in the calculation showed by the dotted - dashed lines we have used the upper - half of the disk only.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    as the inclination increases the solid angle subtended by the neutrino surface decreases , producing a reduction in the luminosities and rates . the average energy , estimated as the ratio between the luminosity and the number of neutrinos per second , becomes insensitive to this reduction .",
    "its behavior is mainly affected by the energy shifts . at zero inclination",
    "the neutrino energies observed from different parts of the neutrino surface are all similarly redshifted : gravitational redshift dominates over doppler shifts . in this case",
    "the linear velocity of an element of emitting matter is perpendicular to the observer s .",
    "as the inclination increases the linear velocity of the disk becomes parallel to the observer s .",
    "then energies of half the torus are redshifted and the other half appear blueshifted .",
    "thus the shifts in energies are totally different from the shifts in the perpendicular direction .",
    "the overall effect is a maximum increase in the observed average energies of about 2 mev for @xmath4 and 1 mev for @xmath3 from @xmath139 to @xmath140 deg .",
    "considering a transparent ( full ) torus has the obvious consequence of having roughly twice the luminosities and rates than the corresponding quantities for a half torus .",
    "the small differences in the average energies are due to the fact that the lower parts ( for @xmath141 ) of the full neutrino surface are farther from the observer who registers different redshifts for neutrinos coming from that area compared to the ones coming from the upper half . when the inclination is 90 degrees the number luminosities and luminosities of the full torus are twice half the disk and the average energies are the same .",
    "the differences in average energies when a full or half torus are considered are larger for spinning bhs than for the @xmath3 case .",
    "this is because the energy shift depends on the bh spin and therefore the higher the spin the larger the differences in the average energies between the full and half tori .",
    "collapsars , bh - ns and ns - ns mergers can evolve into a bh surrounded by an accretion disk .",
    "the physics of these objects is crucial in our understanding of gravitiational waves , gamma ray bursts and the production of heavy neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the structure of the bh affects the thermodynamic properties of the disk leading to changes in the neutrino surfaces , their fluxes , and consequently in the setting of the neutron to proton fraction , and annihilation rates .",
    "we have studied the influence that the bh spin and the location of a distant observer have on several neutrino properties using a ray - tracing technique in general relativity . for the torus model",
    "we have used two different approaches : 1 ) an extension to 3d of a one dimensional fully relativistic steady state disk and 2 ) a time - dependent axisymmetric hydrodynamical torus . for both models we found that the spin of the bh strongly affects the behavior of the neutrino surfaces .",
    "regardless of the flavor , the neutrino surface of an accreting torus around a spinning bh has , when compared to the non - spinning bh , higher neutrino temperatures and larger neutrino surfaces .",
    "these characteristics lead to higher neutrino luminosities and average energies .",
    "more luminous neutrinos would annihilate at a higher rate and therefore , rotating bhs with total neutrino luminosities @xmath142 are a more likely short gamma ray burst source than steady ones ( in agreement with @xcite ) .",
    "our estimates for neutrino counts per second at superk , assuming the source is at 10 kpc , are larger for disks around spinning bhs , and these detection rates are at least a factor of 10 larger than supernova detection rates , regardless of the torus model .",
    "this due to the larger temperatures .",
    "the total number of counts and the duration of the signal depend on the efficiency of converting gravitational energy into neutrino energy .",
    "spinning bhs are more efficient and this is reflected in the larger counts we predict compared to the tori around static bhs . for constant accretion rates we estimate signals lasting tenths of seconds , whereas the number of events varies from few to several thousands ( increasing with the accretion rate ) .",
    "the fluxes , luminosities , average energies and detection rates depend on the angle that the disk describes in the observer s sky . at larger inclinations",
    "the fluxes , luminosities , and detection rates decrease .",
    "this is due to the fact that the apparent area of the neutrino surface becomes smaller with increasing angles .",
    "due to doppler effects , included already in the energy shifts , the average energies increase with the inclination of the observer .    as the possibly observable quantities depend on the apparent emission area to the observer , it is relevant to ask : what is the appropriate neutrino surface for a given observer s inclination ?",
    "here we assumed that once the neutrinos decouple from matter , at the last points of scattering , they do not pass through an optically thick region again .",
    "this however could lead to overestimates and so we contrast these results with a case where only the upper half of the neutrino surface ( on the @xmath132 ) emits .",
    "for example , in the case of an observer located on the axis perpendicular to the plane of the disk ( here @xmath74-axis ) it is reasonable to assume that neutrinos located in the lower half will likely be reabsorbed as they are back to the high density regions inside  the neutrino surface . then at zero inclination",
    "our estimates from the upper half of the torus seem reasonable , whereas the full disk provides us with upper limits .",
    "however , geodesics coming from the lower part could indeed reach the observer due to the deflection of neutrino trajectories . this effect is stronger as the observer s inclination is increased .",
    "for an observer located on the equatorial plane ( @xmath135 ) neutrinos emitted from the farthest ( opposite ) parts of the torus leave the disk with trajectories tangential to the disk and have fewer chances to be re - absorbed .",
    "then gravitational effects would allow us to see  the opposite side of the neutrino surface .",
    "similarly , the hottest neutrinos emitted near the bh can be strongly deflected and reach the observer contributing to the total flux . at this inclination ,",
    "considering only a part of the neutrino surface as the emitting area would lead to underestimates .",
    "we found that the average energies are not largely affected by these considerations compared to the effects on luminosities and detection rates .",
    "the latter could be overestimated by roughly a factor of two if the tori are assumed transparent for zero inclination , and perhaps by a larger factor for observers near the equatorial plane of the disks .",
    "we will leave for future work a detailed study of the effects of reabsorption of the neutrino geodesics .",
    "the results presented here also motivate future studies on the effects of the bh spin on the synthesis of elements .",
    "neutrinos set the electron fraction and any changes in the neutrino fluxes will be reflected on the element abundances , particularly in the wind nucleosynthesis .",
    "furthermore , the properties of the torus outflows will change at different inclinations .",
    "the gravitational effects will be much more prominent as the observer , in this case the outflowing matter , is closer to the bh than the observers considered here .",
    "we will also address this in future work .",
