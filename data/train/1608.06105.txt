    "in contrast , the role of the riemannian metric still lacks a deeper understanding ; geodesic distance in the space @xmath0 , endowed with the fubini - studi metric , can be associated to the transition amplitudes for going from one to another state @xcite .",
    "what is more , a deeper connection between the riemannian structure and the underlying statistical structure of quantum states exists @xcite .",
    "indeed , consider the hilbert space of the square integrable functions over a measure space @xmath8 . in this case , the states of quantum system are normalised wave functions @xmath9 , @xmath10 whose moduli square represent the probability densities over @xmath11 .",
    "now , consider a subset of @xmath0 which is parametrised by a family @xmath12 . by assuming one - to - one parametrizations , the polar representation of elements in @xmath0 ,    @xmath13    provides an embedding of the family @xmath14 into @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath15 is a real valued function and @xmath16 is a probability distribution on the space @xmath11 .",
    "the hermitian tensor @xmath17 on the space of rays @xmath18 can be pulled - backed to @xmath14 and it takes the form    @xmath19+\\ee_p[(d\\alpha)^2]-\\ee_p[d\\alpha]^2-i\\ \\ee_p[d\\ln p\\wedge d\\alpha].\\ ] ]    here , @xmath20=\\int_x",

    "the symmetric part of @xmath22 is a riemannian tensor metric and it is given by @xmath23+\\ee_p[(d\\alpha)^2]-\\ee_p[d\\alpha]^2\\ ] ] in agreement with @xcite , while the symplectic form , corresponding to the imaginary part of @xmath22 , reads as @xmath24.\\ ] ] remarkably , the hermitian tensor @xmath22 coincides with the classical fisher - rao information metric when @xmath25 .",
    "hence , the parameter space @xmath14 inherits the structure of a riemannian manifold whenever the quantum behaviour represented by the phase @xmath26 vanishes .",
    "if it does not , @xmath14 may be a khlerian manifold .",
    "however , the symmetric part of the khlerian structure is still a riemannian metric that has an additional contribution with respect to the fisher - rao information metric .",
    "the purpose of this article is to investigate the connection between the geometric structures of @xmath14 when the phase @xmath15 vanishes and when it does not ; furthermore , we will study the implications that the factor @xmath27 has in the statistical description of the problem . in particular , we will see that the classical behaviour of the system can be recovered as a totally geodesic submanifold of the quantum one .    due to the statistical nature of the problem",
    ", information geometry @xcite can be a suitable tool in describing the riemannian geometric structures of the parameter space @xmath14 .",
    "in such a context , @xmath14 is known as a statistical manifold .",
    "a central issue in statistics is the problem of existence and construction of geodesic foliations of a statistical manifold in order to relate the basic statistical properties to independence of estimates and ancillarity @xcite . from a physical point of view",
    ", often the trajectories of a standard system can be seen as geodesics .",
    "this classical result relies on the variational formulation of dynamics @xcite .",
    "in fact , hamilton s principle states that the natural motions of a hamiltonian system are the extrema of the action functional @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the lagrangian function of the system , and the geodesic of a riemannian manifold are the extrema of the length functional @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the arc - length parameter .",
    "once a connection between length and action is established , by means of a suitable choice of the metric , it will be possible to identify the geodesic with the physical trajectories .",
    "now , this connection has been established through the fisher - rao metric as far as only the classical description of the problem is given @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , qm setting lacks a uniquely defined metric in describing dynamics . in order to study the differences between the classical and quantum settings",
    "we will consider the example of a family of univariate gaussian distributions as statistical manifold . as the riemannian metric we will consider both , the classical and the quantum fisher - rao metric .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the geodesic motion in the univariate gaussian statistical manifold .",
    "the physical interpretation of geodesic curves in the manifold @xmath14 relies in the framework of entropic dynamics @xcite which makes use of inductive inference ( maximum entropy methods @xcite ) and information geometry @xcite .",
    "an update on the knowledge of the system , through further measurements for instance , results in better estimates of relevant observables .",
    "the geodesic joining the previous estimate with the newer one is the path that joins points with a minimal increase of the relative entropy during the intermediate steps .",
    "thus , the study of the fixed point of the geodesic flow on the manifold provides an understanding about the optimal estimates arc .",
    "as we will see , the state of minimum entropy is not in general a possible fixed point of the evolution in the quantum setting .",
    "this is a manifestation of the uncertainty principle in the context of information geometry .    a complete understanding of geodesic dynamics is provided by means of the equation stemming from the second variation of the length functional , the jacobi  levi - civita equation for the geodesic deviation vector field @xcite .",
    "applied to the manifold associated with a physical system , this is a powerful tool to investigate the ( in)stability of the geodesic trajectories by relating ( in)stability to the curvature properties of the manifold @xcite .",
    "along this direction , we describe the riemann curvature tensor within the quantum scenario ; then , we obtain straightforwardly the description in the classic scenario as restriction of the quantum case .",
    "we will see that the manifold associated with the classical states is an isotropic one @xcite , i.e. the geometry does not depend on directions . whereas this does not happen for the quantum scenario",
    ". however , the manifold describing quantum states has constant negative scalar curvature .",
    "this leads to a spread of geodesic balls which in turn suggests a spread of the geodesic flow .",
    "this instability of geodesic dynamics is obtained by the analysis of jacobi vector fields . in the classic scenario ,",
    "the situation turns out to be quite different .",
    "indeed , there exists a stable fixed point for the geodesic dynamics .",
    "hence , geodesics collapse to it as the time increases .",
    "the layout of the article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : geom ] we describe geometric aspects of the riemannian manifold associated with the univariate gaussian statistical model which might represent physical states in both the quantum and classical setting . in particular , we obtain the classical picture as a totally geodesic submanifold of the quantum scenario . in sec .",

    "[ sec : jac ] we study the instability properties of the geodesic flow by means of jacobi vector fields . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] we draw some conclusions by summarizing the results obtained in this work and discussing possible extensions .",
    "consider the statistical manifold @xmath14 of univariate gaussian probability distributions embedded in @xmath0 .",
    "the polar representation of physical states is then given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath36 .",
    "the phase function is taken here as the simplest non - trivial linear function of the variable @xmath37 .",
    "notice that the probability distribution in the random variable @xmath37 is the univariate gaussian distribution @xmath38 the statistical manifold @xmath14 is endowed with the hermitian tensor which is , in this particular case , given in local coordinates by @xmath39 notice that it does not define a khler structure since the antisymmetric part is not symplectic .",
    "it immediately follows that the riemannian metric is given by : @xmath40 in general , given a metric tensor @xmath2 of a riemannian manifold , the levi - civita connection @xmath41 can be computed through its christoffel symbols @xmath42 , which are given in local coordinates by @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the components of the riemannian metric tensor ( being @xmath45 the components of its inverse ) .",
    "hence , by identifying @xmath46 , a straightforward computation leads to the christoffel symbols of @xmath2 : @xmath47 whereas the other symbols are zero .",
    "we recall that a subset @xmath48 of a manifold @xmath14 is a _ regular submanifold _ if it is a topological manifold with the relative topology and if for each @xmath49 there is a local coordinate system @xmath50 such that @xmath51-\\varepsilon,+\\varepsilon[^3\\\\ & & \\varphi_\\lambda(u_\\lambda\\cup n)=\\{(\\theta^1,\\ldots\\theta^n,0,\\ldots,0)\\ |\\ |\\theta^i|<\\varepsilon\\}\\ ( n = 3).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if @xmath48 is a regular submanifold of the manifold @xmath52",
    "it inherits in a natural way a riemannian metric @xmath53 which is the restriction to @xmath48 of the metric @xmath2 .",
    "the submanifold is said totally geodesic if @xmath54 in particular , the geodesics of @xmath14 starting from a point @xmath55 with tangent vector @xmath56 are still geodesics of @xmath48 .",
    "let us now consider the submanifold @xmath48 defined by requiring @xmath57 .",
    "the set of local coordinates in @xmath48 is @xmath58 .",
    "in such a way , @xmath48 is clearly a regular submanifold of @xmath14 and is endowed with the metric tensor @xmath59 this is the classical fisher - rao metric .",
    "the statistical manifold @xmath48 endowed with @xmath53 is usually employed to describe the univariate gaussian statistical model @xmath60 more precisely , the fisher - rao metric is four times the tensor @xmath53 . however",
    ", this factor does not play any role since by chentsov s theorem the fisher - rao metric is uniquely determined up to a multiplicative constant @xcite .",
    "the levi - civita connection compatible with @xmath53 is then computed through its christoffel symbols which result @xmath61 at this point , by comparing eq . with eq .",
    "it follows that @xmath62 is a totally geodesic submanifold of @xmath52 with respect to the levi - civita connection .",
    "the riemannian formulation of classical dynamics is not unique , even if we restrict ourselves to the case of natural systems .",
    "there are several possible choices for the ambient space and its metric .",
    "recently , in the context of information geometry the classical configuration space is replaced by a statistical manifold endowed with the fisher - rao metric and the dynamics has been worked out through the action where the lagrangian is the one associated with the fisher metric @xcite . in this particular case ,",
    "the physical trajectories of the system correspond to the geodesics .",
    "as far as a quantum system is concerned no connection between the action and the length has been established . however , in order to establish differences between classical and quantum systems we also consider geodesics on quantum statistical manifolds . before handling the issue of second order dynamics on the gaussian statistical systems modelled by the manifolds @xmath14 and @xmath48 , we consider the behaviour of geodesics through the jacobi fields which link the features of geodesic motion to the curvature properties of a manifold @xcite .    given a geodesic @xmath63\\rightarrow m$ ] and @xmath64",
    ", a jacobi vector field @xmath65 is the unique solution of the jacobi  levi - civita equation , @xmath66 such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 . here",
    ", @xmath69 denotes the space of vector fields over the geodesic @xmath70 , @xmath41 is the levi - civita connection and @xmath71 is the riemann curvature tensor with respect to the levi - civita connection .",
    "the components @xmath72 of the riemann curvature tensor are given in local coordinates by , @xmath73 the coordinate expression of the curvature tensor satisfies the following identities , @xmath74    an important geometric aspect of the riemann tensor concerns geodesic deviation , that is , the fact that nearby geodesics that start parallel do not remain parallel . in order to measure the geodesic deviation ,",
    "we need to consider the jacobi vector field and to describe the way of changing of this vector along a geodesic .",
    "this geometric approach of dynamical instability allows a unification of the method to measure chaos with the explanation of its origin .",
    "in fact , the evolution of the field @xmath4 given by the jacobi equation contains all the information needed to compute lyapunov exponents , and allows one to also recognize in the curvature properties of the ambient manifold the origin of chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , this approach encounters also some practical difficulties . for instance , the only case in which it is possible to rigorously prove that some definite curvatures properties imply chaos in the geodesic flow is the case of compact manifolds whose curvature is everywhere negative . indeed , in this case , the negative curvature forces nearby geodesics to locally separate exponentially , while the compactness ensures that such a separation does not reduce to a trivial explosion of the system and obliges the geodesics to fold .",
    "in the case of _ isotropic _ manifolds , eq . has a remarkably simple form .",
    "it becomes @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the constant sectional curvature of the manifold .",
    "the sectional curvature @xmath77 at @xmath78 with respect to the plane @xmath79 spanned by two vector fields @xmath80 is given by the relation @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes the norm induced by the riemannian metric tensor at @xmath83 .",
    "in this particular case , the jacobi fields on the geodesic @xmath70 which are zero for @xmath84 have the form @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a parallel vector field which is orthogonal to @xmath87 ; whereas , @xmath88\\rightarrow \\rr $ ] is the function given by @xmath89    consider now the manifold @xmath14 given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 are the coordinates used to describe the quantum states in the model given by . from eqs .",
    ", we directly compute the components of the riemann curvature tensor as @xmath92 being zero the other independent ones .    then , from and we are able to work out the sectional curvatures of @xmath14 , @xmath93 these relations show the anisotropy of the manifold @xmath14 .",
    "thus , beyond solving the jacobi  levi - civita equation , a chance to the get information about the geodesic flow can be obtained by the scalar curvature @xmath94 .",
    "it can be directly computed from ; indeed , @xmath94 is the summation of all the @xmath95 sectional curvatures of @xmath14 , and so we have that @xmath96 .    actually , when the scalar curvature is positive at a point , the volume of a small ball around the point has smaller volume than a ball with the same radius in the euclidean space .",
    "in contrast , when the scalar curvature is negative at a point , the volume of a small ball is larger than it would be in euclidean space .",
    "this is quantitatively expressed by means of the following relation , @xmath97 here , @xmath98 denotes a ball in @xmath14 with radius @xmath99 ; whereas , @xmath100 represents the euclidean ball with equivalent radius @xmath99 .",
    "hence , being @xmath96 , eq .",
    "suggests that the geodesic dynamics is not locally stable and two geodesic curves starting from the same point tend to get far away one from the other .",
    "we have already seen how the manifold @xmath101 can be employed to describe the statistical model @xmath102 of eq . .",
    "in addition , we showed that it is a totally geodesic submanifold of @xmath14 in .",
    "for this reason its riemannian curvature tensor can be obtained by the restriction to @xmath48 of @xmath103 given by the components in .",
    "this leads to @xmath104 as the unique component of the curvature tensor of @xmath48 ; hence , from it follows that the sectional curvature of @xmath48 is @xmath105 .",
    "this result entails that @xmath106 is an isotropic riemannian manifold .",
    "therefore , every jacobi field along any geodesic @xmath107 on @xmath48 has the form @xmath108",
    "let us recall that a curve @xmath109\\rightarrow m$ ] on a riemannian manifold @xmath14 is said geodesic with respect the connection @xmath41 if it is transported parallelly along itself , that is , if @xmath110 .",
    "such a requirement results into @xmath111 which describe the second  order dynamics on the manifold @xmath14 . here",

    "notice that @xmath116 is necessarily positive .",
    "furthermore , any choice of constants @xmath117 and @xmath116 define an invariant submanifold of the tangent bundle @xmath118 which is projectable onto @xmath14 .",
    "such a choice defines an implicit differential equation which can be integrated by considering the two vector fields @xmath119 @xmath120    these vector fields can be obtained from eq . which is equivalent to @xmath121      in the totally geodesic submanifold @xmath48 , eq .",
    "[ dynamicsq ] becomes :    @xmath122    notice that this amounts to choose the parameter @xmath123 .",
    "different values of @xmath124 and @xmath116 lead to different first order differential equations whose solutions are geodesics of the statistical manifold @xmath106 . in order for the vector field to be well defined , it must hold @xmath125 .",

    "[ dyn+ ] the solutions of differential equation @xmath144 are plotted for @xmath145 and @xmath146 and different initial data .",
    "we can see that the qualitative behaviour of them is similar : after a finite time they achieve a maximum value which is preserved in the subsequent dynamics resulting in a constant one .",
    "such a maximum value is the fixed point of the dynamics in the leaf of the tangent bundle @xmath147 given by the above mentioned values of @xmath124 and @xmath116 .",
