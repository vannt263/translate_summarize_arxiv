    "heterogeneity and memory strength are two remarkable features in characterizing time series produced by complex systems .",
    "heterogeneity quantifies the extent that the distribution of time series differs from a normal distribution .",
    "in particular , many real time series , denoted by @xmath4 , are empirically found to follow power - law distributions @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "examples include the magnitudes of earthquake @xcite , the intensity of wars @xcite , the severity of terrorist attacks @xcite , the strength of fluctuations in finance market @xcite , the time intervals between human - activated events @xcite , and so on .",
    "notice that , when talking about time intervals , @xmath6 stands for the time interval between the occurrences of the @xmath7th and @xmath8th events , but not the exact time the @xmath7th event happens .",
    "memory strength characterizes the correlation between neighboring or nearby elements : a positive memory strength indicates that a high - value ( low - value ) element is likely to be followed by some high - value ( low - value ) elements .",
    "memory strength effects are observed in a large variety of real - world time series @xcite , such as natural phenomena ( e.g. , earthquake and daily precipitation ) @xcite , online human activities ( e.g. , visits on movies , books and music ) @xcite , physiological signals ( e.g. , respiratory and liver cirrhosis time series ) @xcite , and so on .",
    "such memory strength effects also play a significant role in modeling spatial mobility @xcite and temporal activities @xcite of human beings .    here",
    "we adopt the simplest measure , first - order autocorrelation @xcite , to characterize the memory strength effect of a finite time series @xmath9 , namely the pearson s correlation coefficient between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 refer to the means and standard deviations of the two series . in the recent studies",
    "@xcite , the memory strength coefficient @xmath15 was usually treated as an independent measure of the heterogeneity , with natural bounds @xmath16 .",
    "recently , the validity of @xmath15 was challenged by the sensitivity of autocorrelation function to the fat tails in @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "indeed , if @xmath17 follows a power - law distribution as @xmath5 with @xmath18 , the autocorrelation function @xmath19 , defined as the pearson correlation coefficient between @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) , also decays in a power - law form as @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite . very similar to the memory strength coefficient @xmath15 , the pearson correlation coefficient is also applied in quantifying the degree - degree correlation in complex networks , named assortativity coefficient @xcite .",
    "analogously , in networks with heterogeneous degree distribution , this commonly used coefficient is questioned for its nontrivial bounds in real networks @xcite and theoretical network models @xcite , as well as the dependence on network size ( i.e. , the assortativity coefficient decreases with the network size ) @xcite .",
    "accordingly , some alternative ranking - based coefficients are proposed , such as the kendall - gibbons tau @xcite and spearman s rho @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the memory strength effects in human temporal activities have considerable impacts on epidemic processes @xcite and the degree - degree correlation largely affects dynamics upon the networks , including epidemic spreading @xcite , evolutionary game @xcite , synchronization @xcite , and so on . in these works ,",
    "the memory strength and correlation are quantified by the above debatable coefficients .",
    "therefore , the understanding of fundamental properties of such coefficients in heterogeneous systems is very valuable .    in this paper , given the elements @xmath25 , we calculate the maximum and minimum values of @xmath15 under any permutation , suggesting the dependence between memory strength coefficient and series heterogeneity . in particular , given a power - law distribution @xmath5 , we show unreported nontrivial bounds of @xmath15 in the thermodynamic limit ( i.e. , @xmath26 )  when @xmath2 , as @xmath0 grows bigger , the upper bound increases from 0 to + 1 while the lower bound remains 0 ; when @xmath3 , the upper bound remains + 1 while the lower bound descends below 0 but strictly above -1 .",
    "the theoretical bounds agree very well with numerical simulations .",
    "in addition , according to the empirical analysis on _ movielens _ and _ twitter _ , power - law distributed inter - event time series produced by human activities are found to conform to such bounds .",
    "our findings add novel insights in characterizing not only heterogeneous time series , but also heterogeneous networks and other complex systems with heavy - tailed distributions .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will derive the theoretical bounds of @xmath15 given @xmath27 .",
    "such bounds will get validated based on extensive numerical tests in section iii and empirical results in section iv .",
    "we will draw the main conclusion , discuss the relevance and implication of our findings in section v.",
    "given a finite set of real numbers @xmath9 independently sampled from a certain distribution , without loss of generality , we order them as @xmath28 , which are referred to as _ order statistics_. then , by applying a permutation @xmath29 ( a one - to - one mapping from the set @xmath30 to itself ) to @xmath31 , we have a new sequence @xmath32 with a different interdependence structure among elements . by changing @xmath29 , we can expect series with different values of @xmath15 .",
    "for example , if series are permuted such that big elements tend to be followed by big ones and small followed by small ones , @xmath33 would be positive ; on the contrary , if big elements followed by small ones and small elements followed by big ones , @xmath15 would be negative .",
    "interestingly , there exists explicit @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( though not unique ) that respectively maximizes and minimizes @xmath33 among all possible permutations .",
    "and we can use these two extremes to derive the bounds for memory strength in the sense of all permuted independent samples .    to see this ,",
    "we need to find out how a permutation affects @xmath33 .",
    "as the values of the two aforementioned series are different in only one element ( @xmath36 in head and @xmath37 in tail ) , we assume @xmath38 and @xmath39 when @xmath40 is large , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the mean and standard deviation of the whole series .",
    "the memory strength of @xmath43 can hence be rewritten as @xmath44 where the reordering of the series only affects the summed products of adjacent terms @xmath45 while @xmath41 and @xmath42 are invariant to permutations .",
    "the desired extreme permutations for @xmath33 are just those maximize / minimize @xmath46 , denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that , for any @xmath40 , there are explicit solutions to @xmath34 and @xmath35 for any real numbers @xmath47 .",
    "notice that , whereas hallin _",
    "@xcite use an objective function that sums the products in a cycle ( and therefore they call the problem _ optimal hamiltonian cycles _ ) , i.e. @xmath48 , the results can be reduced to our case by introducing an additional element @xmath49 to the series , which makes zero contribution to the sum .",
    "@xmath34 achieves the maximum memory strength by first arranging the odd elements of order statistics in the increasing order , followed by even elements in the decreasing order , which is @xmath50 for simplicity , we only address the case when @xmath51 , the sum with order statistics is expressed as @xmath52 while the case of @xmath53 can be handled analogously .    on the contrary , @xmath35 arranges the order statistics by alternating small and big terms , namely @xmath54 where when @xmath55 is even , even and odd terms are interlaced ; when @xmath55 is odd , half of the sequence is made up of even terms while the other half odd .",
    "similarly , for even @xmath40 , we have @xmath56 and the case of @xmath57 is analogous .",
    "we then define the upper bound and lower bound for memory strength as the expectation of @xmath33 under @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the limit of infinitely long series .",
    "the bounds , defined as @xmath58 and @xmath59 measure the memory strength constraints imposed by a marginal distribution , where e denotes the operator to obtain the expected value . as we will see , these bounds can be derived in a closed form or effectively approximated for several distributions .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath60 and @xmath61 hold for uniform and gaussian distributions , corresponding to the natural range of @xmath33 ( see details in _ appendix a _ and _ appendix b _ ) . however",
    ", a much narrower range is found for power - law distributions , where the bounds rely on the exponent @xmath62 .",
    "while the rest of the paper focuses on power - law , we also notice a few other distributions with non - trivial memory strength constraints , which are discussed in _",
    "appendix c_.    supposing that the series @xmath9 are independently sampled from a power - law distribution with density @xmath63 to derive how the bounds rely on @xmath62 , we first consider the case where @xmath64 , which is necessary for the population variance @xmath65 ( appearing in the denominator of @xmath33 ) to converge .",
    "when @xmath66 , by the strong law of large numbers and continuous mapping theorem , we have @xmath67 almost surely as @xmath68 , where the sample moments are replaced by the corresponding population moments @xmath69 and @xmath70 here we assume @xmath71 because @xmath33 would remain the same if every @xmath72 is divided by the same constant .",
    "since @xmath73 , by lebesgue s dominated convergence theorem , we can switch the order between limit and expectation and have @xmath74 therefore , in the @xmath75 case , @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be respectively determined by @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the limit of large @xmath55 .    according to eq .",
    "( [ eqs : smax ] ) , for the case of @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 whereas the case of @xmath53 can be worked out in a similar fashion to arrive at the same result .",
    "the expected value of each term can be obtained by using the joint distribution of order statistics .",
    "the probability density function for the joint distribution of two order statistics @xmath82 is given by @xcite @xmath83^{j-1}}{(j-1 ) ! }",

    "@xmath101 the other term has the same limit , namely @xmath102 and again the remaining term vanishes as @xmath103 therefore , the minimum memory strength for @xmath75 is @xmath104 , \\label{eqs : min - mem - theory}\\ ] ] where the population moments are given by eqs .",
    "( [ eqs : m - alpha ] ) and ( [ eqs : sigma - alpha ] ) .",
    "noticeably , @xmath77 is a decreasing function of @xmath0 ( see figure [ fig : bounds ] ) that approaches -0.65 as @xmath0 gets large .     and",
    "@xmath105 under different sequence lengths @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "mean values approach their corresponding theoretical bounds ( dashed lines ) as @xmath55 increases . ]",
    "having obtained the upper bound ( [ eqs : max - mem - theory ] ) and the lower bound ( [ eqs : min - mem - theory ] ) for @xmath66 , we now turn to the case for @xmath111 ( @xmath112 is necessary for power - law to be normalized ) . in this case , the corresponding population moment for @xmath113 would diverge ( @xmath114 also diverges when @xmath115 ) , rendering the moment - substitution technique infeasible .",
    "meanwhile , it seems formidable to deal with the probability distributions of @xmath116 and @xmath117 directly .",
    "therefore , we present an approximation method that recovers the asymptotic behavior of statistics when @xmath26 by substituting random variables with deterministic surrogates .",
    "to do so , we pick the points @xmath118 that cut the area under the probability density function @xmath119 into slices of equal area @xmath120 , with @xmath121 and the area from @xmath37 extending to infinity also being @xmath120 .",
    "then we approximate the random samples @xmath122 with these deterministic points @xmath123 .",
    "it should be noted that such approximation imposes a cut - off on the maximum value of @xmath31 and the probability of drawing a sample exceeding the cut - off is @xmath120 , which diminishes to zero as @xmath26 .",

    "this family of functions are denoted by @xmath138 generically . with some algebra , we have @xmath139 and @xmath140 which two hold for both @xmath141 and @xmath142 .    then , for the upper bound , we have @xmath143,\\ ] ] which diverges with the order of @xmath144 . by comparing it with the order of @xmath134 and @xmath133 , in the limit of large @xmath40 , we know @xmath145",

    "however , when @xmath158 , @xmath155 converges to a non - degenerate random variable whose distribution depends on @xmath0 , as evidenced by the non - vanishing error bars in that region .",

    "the series correspond to the time intervals between two consecutive rating .",

    "we study the time series of browsing behavior of individuals in this paper .    for comparison , we rule out the series in the datasets that are either too short ( @xmath161 for _ twitter _ , @xmath162 for _ movielens _ and _ taobao _ , and @xmath163 for _ mobile phone _ ) or are unlikely to follow a power - law ( @xmath164 ) .",

    "@xmath0 is estimated with maximum likelihood @xcite . as can be seen from the plot , except for a few outliers ,",
    "most of the sequences fall into the predicted region .",
    "it is worth recapitulating that the predicted upper bound for @xmath166 is an approximate to the mean , and the non - zero variance of @xmath155 ( see figure 1 ) allows some points to exceed the predicted upper bound .",
    "notice that , the theoretical bounds are derived under two strong conditions : the target sequence is infinitely long , with its elements following a prefect power - law distribution .",
    "in contrast , real sequences are very short ( @xmath167 for real sequences , while in figure 1 , we have tested the case with @xmath168 ) and far from perfect power laws .",
    "therefore , the results presented in fig . 2 indicates the high applicability of the theoretical bounds to real heterogenous systems .",
    "in this article , we explore non - trivial bounds on the memory strength of power - law distributed series , which challenge the common treatment of memory strength as a measure independent of heterogeneity .",
    "we seek the bounds inside an ensemble formed by permuting independently and identically distributed power - law series , which covers a wide range of dependent structures while preserving the marginal distribution .",
    "based on results in permutational extreme values , we present the bounds in either closed form or with an effective approximation .",
    "our bounding technique relies on a permutation ensemble of which the extremes are solvable .",
    "although it does not subsume all possible power - law distributed series , we speculate that it is reasonably flexible that is covers most `` natural '' series .",
    "for example , series with @xmath169 and @xmath170 is an `` unnatural '' construction that is not contained by the ensemble .",
    "it is worth further investigation on the applicability of the permutation ensemble and the possibility of constructing other tractable ensembles with larger flexibility and fewer assumptions .",
    "nevertheless , the usefulness of permutation ensemble is evidenced by empirical data ( human activities in this case ) found to closely conform to such bounds .    without the knowledge of the present non - trivial bounds of memory strength",
    ", one may straightforwardly think that the values of @xmath15 in the permutation ensemble are uniformly distributed in the range @xmath171 $ ] with average value being equal to 0 .",
    "if so , when one observes a positive value of @xmath15 as in many real human - activated systems  @xcite , he / she will feel that the memory strength effect of this time series is stronger than the average of the permutation ensemble .",
    "analogously , when one observes a positive assortativity coefficient in a network , he / she will feel that the large - degree nodes tend to connect with other large - degree nodes , compared with the randomized networks with the same degree sequence . however , as indicated by the present results , the above intuition is incorrect .",
    "for example , for a power - law time series with exponent @xmath0 in the range @xmath172 $ ] , the memory strength @xmath15 is non - negative so that a small positive value of @xmath15 is possibly still _ smaller _ than the average of the permutation ensemble .",
    "that is to say , given the values of elements in the time series , a high - value element is indeed more likely to be followed by some lower - value elements than the randomized counterpart even for some @xmath173 .",
    "analogously , in a scale - free network  @xcite with power - law exponent @xmath93 , an extension of the present method yields a nontrivial lower bound of assortativity coefficient @xmath174 in the limit of network size as ( details will be published elsewhere ) : @xmath175 this bound improves the previously known results ( see , for example , eqs . ( 18 - 23 ) in @xcite and eq .",
    "( 64 ) in @xcite ) , in particular for @xmath176 . obviously ,",
    "when @xmath177 $ ] , the lower bound of assortativity coefficient is zero , hence in a real network with assortativity coefficient larger than zero , a large - degree node may be more likely to connect with some smaller - degree nodes than the average in the corresponding null networks with the same degree sequence  @xcite .",
    "therefore , bringing to light the existence of non - trivial bounds of @xmath15 ( and possibly other statistical measures to be revealed by future studies ) in heterogeneous systems , this work could clear up some misunderstanding from the ostensible values of autocorrelation , assortativity coefficient , etc .",
    "since many power - law series have @xmath0 in the range @xmath172 $ ] and many scale - free networks have @xmath93 in the range @xmath178 $ ] , our findings are relevant and significant to the academic society with interests in real complex systems .",
    "lastly , this work gives rise to a natural question , namely how to do proper statistics on heterogeneous systems , whose characteristic distributions may be mathematically ill - posed and/or have divergent finite moments , challenging the validity and usefulness of many commonly - used statistical measures . this question has been attempted by a few earlier works , among which , notably , karsai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported the problem with autocorrelation function and the hurst exponent for characterizing heterogeneous systems , as they `` can assign false positive correlations '' even when the temporal dependence is absent or destroyed . yet , a proper alternative measure , one with desirable theoretical properties , still remains elusive . given a certain statistical measure computed from a system , it would be important to know the relative position of this value compared to the distribution of the same measure computed from a `` reference ensemble '' of systems , such as the permutation ensemble in this case . however , such a task is usually difficult due to the computational complexity associated with the ensemble analysis",
    ". therefore , unfolding the mathematical structure of reference ensembles could be very helpful , which is left as our future aim .",
