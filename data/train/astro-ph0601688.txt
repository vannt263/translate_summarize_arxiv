    "early studies of the broad line profiles in type  1 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) suggested that the large observed line widths ( @xmath17  km  s@xmath3 ) are produced by electron scattering within the photoionized gas ( weymann 1970 ; mathis 1970 ) . with the development of photoionization models for the broad line region ( blr )",
    ", it was however realized that the expected electron scattering optical depth , @xmath8 , within the blr gas is @xmath18 , which is too low to explain the observed line profiles ( davidson & netzer 1979 ) . later studies of the size of the blr , based on reverberation mappings , indicated that the blr is more compact than previously thought ( e.g. rees , netzer , & ferland 1989 ) , and thus @xmath8 is expected to be higher than previously thought , though it is not expected to reach @xmath19 , required to explain the line profiles purely by electron scattering .",
    "there is also good evidence now that the line broadening in the blr is mostly due to virialized bulk motion ( e.g. peterson & wandel 2000 ) .",
    "however , electron scattering by a significantly hotter gas outside the blr gas ( @xmath20 vs. @xmath21 ) remains a viable option ( shields & mckee 1981 ; kallman & krolik 1986 ; emmering et al .",
    "1992 ; bottorff et al .",
    "evidence for electron scattering of continuum photons in agn is provided by wavelength independent polarization in some objects ( e.g. antonucci et al . 1993 ) , but there is yet no conclusive detection of electron scattering effects on the broad line profiles .    a possible exception may occur in ngc  1068 , where spatially resolved spectropolarimetry reveals a broadened h@xmath0  line , which may result from electron scattering in warm ( @xmath22 ) gas ( miller , goodrich & mathews 1991 ) .",
    "a spectropolarimetric search for polarized broad lines in low luminosity agn ( barth et al . 1999 ) revealed a polarized blr component in the lowest luminosity type  i agn , ngc  4395 .",
    "based on that detection , barth et al .",
    "suggested that higher s / n spectropolarimetry may reveal a broadened h@xmath0  component , if the polarization is induced by electron scattering .",
    "here we report on a high quality keck observation of the h@xmath0  line in ngc  4395 , which indeed reveals extended symmetric exponential wings ( though their polarization is unknown ) . as shown below",

    "a complete calculation of electron scattering line profiles involves a calculation of the photon diffusion simultaneously in both real space and in energy space .",
    "such a calculation can be carried out using a monte carlo approach , which is straightforward to implement , though the finite number of photons used tends to produce non smooth curves ( e.g. lee 1999 ) compared to analytic solutions .",
    "analytic solutions for the local diffusion in space , described by the radiative transfer equation , and diffusion in energy , described by the energy redistribution function , have been derived and solved numerically using various simplifying assumptions ( e.g. chandrasekhar 1960 ; mihalas 1978 ; and references therein ) . here",
    "we make two major simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , the electron scattering gas is assumed to be optically thin , thus a detailed radiative transfer solution is not required .",
    "this simplification is justified by the observation that the dominant effect on the line broadening in the blr appears to be gravity dominated bulk motion , rather than electron scattering .",
    "gravity is indicated by the good correspondence between black hole mass estimates assuming a virialized blr and mass estimates based on the host bulge properties ( laor 1998 ; ferrarese et al .",
    "second , we assume an isotropic electron velocity distribution , and an isotropic illumination of the scattering electrons , which is likely to be a good approximation for the integrated scattered radiation .",

    "the narrow gaussian is the unscattered line profile , and the broader curves correspond to @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "the number of photons ( area under each curve ) is assumed to be conserved , and the unscattered line profile was scaled to match the peak of the @xmath78 curve . ]    since the scattering medium is optically thin , each scattering redistributes the observed line profile through @xmath71 , and reduces the number of photons by a factor of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the line profile following @xmath79 scattering is given by a convolution of @xmath71 with the @xmath80 times scattered profile , i.e. @xmath81dv'\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the profile of a line scattered @xmath80 times .",

    "lower panel : the dependence on @xmath8 for @xmath94  k. the integrated scattered flux is proportional to @xmath8 , however @xmath15 is only weakly dependent on @xmath8 . ]        one may attempt to understand the above fit equation based on the following very simple derivation . this derivation is actually oversimplified , and the resulting expression for @xmath15 lacks accuracy , but it provides insight for understanding the basic reason for the formation of exponential profile wings .",
    "this derivation follows closely the derivation of the power law spectral form produced through optically thin electron scattering by relativistic electrons , as described in rl79 ( section 7.5 there ) .",
    "here we have optically thin electron scattering by non relativistic electrons .",
    "let @xmath7 be the mean electron velocity .",
    "the energy amplification of a photon scattered at right angle is @xmath95 after @xmath80 such scattering the photon energy will be @xmath96 where the last step is valid for @xmath97 . changing to velocity scale @xmath98 the fraction of photons scattered @xmath80 times",
    "is @xmath99 , and thus @xmath100 this is equivalent to @xmath101 i.e. an exponential line profile , where @xmath102 the crucial difference here from relativistic electron scattering is that the energy increment with repeated scattering is a constant linear factor , rather than a constant multiplicative factor , which would lead to a power law rather than an exponential form .",
    "the above derivation of @xmath15 does not yield the correct dependence on @xmath103 .",
    "the oversimplification in the above derivation is in the assumption that the energy redistribution function can be approximated as a @xmath104 function at @xmath105 , while as eqs.1 - 3 above show , the photons actually get redistributed nearly symmetrically from @xmath106 to @xmath107 . for highly relativistic electrons",
    "the strong doppler beaming produces a highly asymmetric and strongly peaked redistribution function ( at @xmath108 ) , and the simplified derivation of the power law spectral slope through repeated scattering ( rl79 ) is adequate .",
    "on @xmath8 for two values of @xmath16 .",
    "the filled triangles are values measured from numerical calculations of @xmath85 , and the solid lines are analytic fits of the form @xmath109 to the numerical results ( see text ) .",
    "this fit is accurate to 1.5% in the displayed range . ]",
    "taking into account the shape of the redistribution function leads to a more accurate dependence of @xmath15 on @xmath8 , as described below .",
    "the thermal redistribution function can be approximated as a gaussian with the velocity dispersion of the scattering electrons , @xmath110 .",
    "the seed line profile is assumed to have a smaller velocity width than that of the scattering electrons , so it can be conveniently approximated as a @xmath104 function , @xmath111 .",
    "thus , the first scattering ( eq.5 ) yields @xmath112 , and repeated scattering amount to repeated convolutions with @xmath71 .",
    "such convolutions yield gaussians with a velocity dispersion which grows as @xmath113 , i.e. we can use the approximation @xmath114 where @xmath115 is an arbitrary constant , and the @xmath116 term comes from the gaussian normalization .",
    "the total scattered line profile is then given by @xmath117 unfortunately , there is no simple analytic solution for the sum of this series .",
    "note , however , that only a few terms in the above series contribute at any given @xmath50 .",
    "the contribution of terms with @xmath118 is small because of the large negative exponential factor , while the contribution of terms with @xmath119 is reduced by the @xmath120 factor .",
    "the maximum contribution to @xmath85 in the above sum is provided by the term @xmath121 , which is obtained from the requirement @xmath122 which holds at @xmath123 . since @xmath124",
    "one gets a quadratic equation for @xmath121 @xmath125 the second term can be neglected compared to the first and third terms when @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "thus , the solution is @xmath128 substituting @xmath121 in the general expression for @xmath76 gives @xmath129 we further show that @xmath76 indeed has a narrow peak around @xmath123 .",
    "we define the peak width , @xmath130 , through the relation @xmath131 , which yields after some steps the condition @xmath132 or @xmath133 i.e. only the nearest 1 - 2 bins to @xmath121 contribute significantly for @xmath134 .",
    "thus , at each @xmath50 one can approximate the above sum over @xmath80 by just a single term at @xmath123 , i.e. @xmath135 . to verify that @xmath85 has the correct exponential form we calculate @xmath136 thus , a pure exponential line profile , i.e. @xmath15 independent of @xmath50 , is obtained when the second term on the right is negligible , which occurs at @xmath137 .",
    "the exponential slope is @xmath138 , or @xmath139 , which matches well the @xmath140 dependence of the fitting function to the numerical solution ( eq.8 ) .",
    "to model the shape of the electron scattering wings one needs an estimate of the seed line profile . as shown below , there is no evidence for detectable electron scattering wings for lines originating in the narrow line region ( nlr ) , and we therefore use only the broad component of h@xmath0  for the seed profile . to obtain the blr h@xmath0  component",
    ", we subtract off the narrow h@xmath0  component and the narrow [ n  ii ] lines from the observed h@xmath0  profile . the broad component underlying the narrow lines",
    "is interpolated using a spline fit , where we use the minimum number of spline points required to get both an acceptable @xmath141 , and also matching profiles for the narrow [ n  ii ] doublet lines ( laor et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the observed broad line core at @xmath44  km  s@xmath3 shows a noticeable asymmetry , with up to @xmath142% higher flux in the blue wing ( fig.1 , middle panel ) .",
    "this appears to be a persistent effect in ngc  4395 , as it is also present in high resolution keck spectra taken about a year and eight years earlier ( fig.1 in laor et al .",
    "in contrast , the wings at @xmath51  km  s@xmath3 are generally symmetric to @xmath38% ( with respect to @xmath52  km  s@xmath3 , fig.1 , lower panel ) . since our electron scattering model generates symmetric line profiles , one must assume that the observed asymmetric core profile represents the unscattered seed line . to estimate the shape of the seed line wings , the observed profile is multiplied by a weight function of the arbitrary functional form @xmath143 , which produces a smooth cutoff in the the wings at @xmath144 .",
    "we find that @xmath145  km  s@xmath3 at @xmath146  km  s@xmath3 , and @xmath147  km  s@xmath3 at @xmath148  km  s@xmath3 , are about the minimum values required to exclude the inner asymmetric core emission , and allow the electron scattering model to fit only the extended symmetric wings .",
    "the exact value of @xmath149 can not be accurately constrained , and the true seed profile may be broader than assumed here .",
    "the seed profile is further multiplied by @xmath150 , which represents the wavelength independent suppression due to the electron scattering , where @xmath8 is determined below .    the seed line profile obtained above",
    "is now used as the input line profile for our electron scattering code .",
    "the model free parameters are @xmath16 and @xmath8 , and we iterate over different values for these parameters until a satisfactory fit is obtained between the observed broad h@xmath0  profile , and the sum of the scattered + seed line profiles ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the scattering medium is assumed to have a bulk velocity of @xmath52  km  s@xmath3 , with respect to the narrow line peak , as suggested by the observed asymmetry of the extended wings .",
    "the best fit is obtained for @xmath151  k , and @xmath9 , which yields @xmath152 for 243 degrees of freedom , where @xmath141 is calculated for @xmath37  km  s@xmath3 , excluding the line core region , @xmath153  km  s@xmath3 , affected by the narrow lines .",
    "the best fit @xmath16 and @xmath8 depend on the assumed shape for the seed line profile .",
    "increasing the wings cutoff velocity , @xmath149 , reduces the best fit @xmath8 and increases @xmath16 . for example , adopting @xmath154  km  s@xmath3 yields a best fit solution with @xmath155  k , and @xmath156 .",
    "however , at such a high @xmath149 the seed line contribution becomes negligible ( @xmath157% of total line flux ) at @xmath158  km  s@xmath3 , compared to @xmath159  km  s@xmath3 for the minimum @xmath149 solution .",
    "the observed wings are well fit by a featureless exponential profile already at @xmath159  km  s@xmath3 ( fig.1 , lower panel ) , which suggests this region is dominated by a single component , as we find for the minimum @xmath149 solution .",
    "we therefore adopt below the best fit minimum @xmath149 solution , although one can not rule out a higher @xmath149 solution , where the seed line profile and the scattered wings conspire to produce a single featureless exponential profile at @xmath159  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "once the seed line profile is set , there is essentially no degeneracy in the solution , as @xmath8 is fixed uniquely by the ratio of seed to scattered photon flux ratio , and @xmath16 is then fixed by @xmath8 and the observed exponential slope , @xmath15 .",

    "for example , the instrumental lsf , acting on the narrow h@xmath0  component , produces a flux density at @xmath171  km  s@xmath3 which is @xmath172 of the peak flux density ( fig.6 ) , while the observed h@xmath0  flux density at @xmath171  km  s@xmath3 is @xmath173 of the peak flux density ( fig.5 ) .",
    "in addition , the instrumental lsf scatters only @xmath14% of the line flux into broad wings , while the observed broad wings flux in h@xmath0  amounts to 34% of the line flux , again indicating that the exponential h@xmath0  wings can not be an instrumental effect .",
    "since the [ o  iii ]  @xmath12 line shows no scattering wings , the scattering wings of h@xmath0  must originate in gas at radii smaller than the nlr , most plausibly within the photoionized gas which produces the blr emission lines .",

    "calculating the electron scattering profile of a nonisothermal slab requires a complete radiation transfer calculation , including the h@xmath0  emissivity as a function of depth , which is well beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , our isothermal electron scattering model may capture the @xmath8 weighted mean temperature of the electron scattering medium , which is rather close to the @xmath196  k derived above .",
    "although our best fit model parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath8 , are tightly constrained by the observed h@xmath0  profile , it is not clear that this model is the only possible interpretation .",
    "one may assume that no electron scattering is present , and that the h@xmath0  gas emissivity as a function of velocity in the blr just happens to produce an exponential profile .",
    "how can the electron scattering model be tested ?",
    "a clear prediction of our model is that @xmath8 should be tightly correlated with the ionizing flux .",
    "as the ionizing flux increases the column of ionized gas must increase , and the relative fraction of line flux in the scattering wings should increase . if the blr gas has a large column , so it is ionization bounded rather than matter bounded , then the relation between @xmath8 and the ionizing flux should be linear .",
    "in contrast , the slope of the exponential wings @xmath15 should remain nearly constant .",
    "this occurs since @xmath16 is only weakly dependent on @xmath181 ( for @xmath197 ) , and thus should vary only slightly .",
    "in addition , although @xmath8 is expected to vary linearly with @xmath181 , @xmath15 is only weakly dependent on @xmath8 , and would thus not be significantly affected .",
    "the ionization structure responds on a timescale of @xmath198 seconds , or @xmath199 seconds for the blr , which is much smaller than the blr light crossing time of @xmath14  hour ( peterson et al . 2005 ) .",
    "thus , one expects the measured @xmath8 and @xmath16 to respond to changes in the ionizing continuum on timescales as short as @xmath14  hour .",
    "however , since the dynamical time in the blr of ngc  4395 is @xmath14  week , structural changes may occur on this time scale , or longer , which could eliminate the correlation of @xmath8 and @xmath16 with the ionizing flux ( e.g. due to changes in the blr density and column density ) .    indirect evidence for electron scattering in ngc  4395 is provided by the spectropolarimetry of barth et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who find a wavelength independent polarization of @xmath200% .",
    "the similar low polarization of the continuum and the broad lines suggests the scattering most likely occurs by a low @xmath8 scattering medium outside the blr , rather than within the blr gas , as suggested here .",
    "barth et al .",
    "suggested that  a clear sign of electron scattering would be a broadened h@xmath0  profile in stokes flux , \" .",
    "the exponential h@xmath0  wings revealed in this study are probably not related to the barth et al . prediction , unless scattering off the blr clouds can produce the observed continuum and line polarization ( korista & ferland 1998 ) .",
    "spectropolarimetry at a higher s / n and higher spectral resolution is required to better constrain the location and identity of the polarizing medium in ngc  4395 .",
    "indirect support for the electron - scattering - within - the - blr interpretation is provided by the fact that best fit values of the two free model parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath8 , can apparently be obtained using a single parameter , @xmath201 .",
    "this value of @xmath181 is consistent with the range of @xmath181 values typically deduced in agn , though it is significantly higher than deduced by kraemer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for this object .",
    "can the required @xmath181 and @xmath184 be accommodated within the small blr of ngc  4395 ? to estimate the physical size of such a blr component we use the mean  visit 3 \" flux density of @xmath202  erg@xmath3  s@xmath3  @xmath28  @xmath3 at 1350 , taken from table 3 in peterson et al .",
    "( 2005 , note an erratum with corrected flux ) , which matches well an extrapolation of our esi spectrum to the uv . at a distance of 4.3  mpc ( thim et al .",
    "2004 ) , the corresponding monochromatic luminosity is @xmath203  erg@xmath3  s@xmath3 , corrected for galactic extinction of 0.175 mag at 1350  ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 and table 1 in mathis 1990 ) . assuming the ionizing luminosity is @xmath204 at 1350 , and a mean ionizing photon energy of @xmath205 rydberg , the implied ionizing photon flux from the source is @xmath206  s@xmath3 . using @xmath207 we get @xmath208 , where the distance of the emitting gas is @xmath209  cm , and its density is @xmath210  @xmath211 .",
    "the measured value of @xmath189 implies a distance @xmath212 .",
    "the thickness of the gas slab is @xmath213  cm , and thus for @xmath214 found here we get @xmath215 .",
    "therefore , @xmath216 for @xmath217  @xmath211 , and the implied column of h@xmath0  emitting gas can be accommodated within the compact blr of ngc  4395 , for reasonable values of @xmath179 .    why then are such exponential wings not commonly seen in other agn ?",
    "ngc  4395 is unique among type i agn in having extremely narrow balmer lines .",
    "the broad h@xmath0  fwhm here is just 520  km  s@xmath3 , while the typical h@xmath0  fwhm in agn is @xmath218  km  s@xmath3 , with a few times broader line base .",
    "thus , the electron scattering effect of the blr gas will have a negligible effect on the emission line width in most agn .",
    "however , one can make a clear prediction that the exponential wings should be discernable in other objects with unusually narrow lines .",
    "a reliable detection of such wings requires a high s / n spectrum ( e.g. 10 - 70 here at @xmath219  km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "for example , the h@xmath220  line wings of ngc  4395 , and the h@xmath0  line wings in a keck spectrum of pox  52 ( barth et al .",
    "2004 , kindly provided by a. barth ) , are broadly consistent with an exponential form , but the available s / n in both cases is too low to constrain the profile shape as accurately as done here .",
    "we note in passing that as long as @xmath8 remains low ( @xmath221 ) , electron scattering would not have a significant effect on measurements of the line fwhm , and thus on estimates of the black hole mass ( e.g. kaspi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "high quality keck observations of the h@xmath0  line in ngc  4395 reveal symmetric exponential wings of the form @xmath1 , with @xmath2  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the wings are fit well by an isothermal and isotropic electron scattering model with @xmath9 , and @xmath151k , plausibly generated in photoionized gas with @xmath11 .",
    "the lack of electron scattering wings for the [ o  iii ]  @xmath12 line , and the value of @xmath181 indicate that the scattering occurs within the blr gas where h@xmath0  is formed .",
    "the electron scattering interpretation can be tested by looking for a strong correlation between @xmath8 and the ionizing flux .",
    "high quality spectra of other agn with very narrow balmer lines will provide a further test of the electron scattering interpretation .",
    "if the electron scattering origin is verified , then the extended h@xmath0  wings can provide us with a new direct probe of @xmath16 and @xmath8 within the blr gas , and their time variability .",
    "i would like to thank a. barth for kindly providing the data , a. barth and the referee for very useful comments , and g. ferland for making cloudy publicly available .",
