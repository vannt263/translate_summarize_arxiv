    "<S> we investigate the thermodynamic properties of a polyelectrolyte solution in a presence of _ multivalent _ salts . </S>",
    "<S> the polyions are modeled as rigid cylinders with the charge distributed uniformly along the major axis . </S>",
    "<S> the solution , besides the polyions , contain monovalent and divalent counterions as well as monovalent coions . the strong electrostatic attraction existing between the polyions and the counterions results in formation of clusters consisting of one polyion and a number of associated monovalent and divalent counterions . </S>",
    "<S> the theory presented in the paper allows us to explicitly construct the helmholtz free energy of a polyelectrolyte solution . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic cluster size , as well as any other thermodynamic property can then be determined by an appropriate operation on the free energy .    </S>",
    "<S> 2    * 1 . </S>",
    "<S> introduction *    the polyelectrolytes are ubiquitous in our every day life . </S>",
    "<S> they are present in a variety of industrial products ranging from the hair conditioners to the superabsorbants used in baby diapers . </S>",
    "<S> the carrier of genetic code , the dna , is also a polyelectrolyte . </S>",
    "<S> not withstanding their omnipresence , our understanding of this class of polymers is far from complete . </S>",
    "<S> the long range coulomb interaction combined with a strong asymmetry existing between the various entities of a polyelectrolyte solution , has proven to be a formidable challenge to the standard methods of liquid state theory . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling approaches which were so successful in elucidating the properties of non - ionic polymers have , so far , failed in their extension to polyelectrolytes . </S>",
    "<S> what seems to be lacking is a mean - field theory similar to the one constructed by flory for the simple polymers and by debye and hckel for the symmetric electrolytes . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we have attempted to construct such a mean - field theory for the special class of rigid polyelectrolytes , an example of which is provided by a solution of dna segments . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of working with a rod - like polyelectrolytes is that the intramolecular degrees of freedom associated with the conformational state of a polyion can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the polyelectrolyte solution then becomes a strongly asymmetric electrolyte , to which a generalization of the debye - hckel - bjerrum ( dhbj ) theory @xcite can be applied . </S>",
    "<S> additional advantage in working with rigid polyelectrolytes is that they obey the manning infinite dilution limiting laws @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these laws are extremely useful since they provide the boundary conditions that any theory of rod - like polyelectrolytes must satisfy .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the extension of the dhbj theory to rigid polyelectrolytes , indeed , satisfies the manning limiting laws @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the theory is in excellent agreement with the experiments on rigid polyelectrolyte solutions in a presence of monovalent salt @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently we have extended our work to study the interaction of a polyelectrolyte with a cationic surfactants @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter problem is of great practical interest in a variety of biochemical and biomedical applications related to design of gene delivery systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> again , the dhbj theory has proven successful in giving quantitative agreement with experiments without a need for any adjustable parameters . in the current work </S>",
    "<S> we shall extend the theory to allow for the presence of both the monovalent and the divalent salts . </S>",
    "<S> this problem , once again , is motivated by the biomedical applications to gene therapy . </S>",
    "<S> it has been recently found that introduction of a dna into host cells is facilitated by the presence of a small amount of divalent salt such as calcium phosphate @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> since the bulk of the calculations is similar to those presented in the earlier work , we shall not enter in great detail and instead refer the reader to the previously published papers @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> = 8.cm    * </S>",
    "<S> 2 . the model </S>",
    "<S> *    we begin by defining the primitive model of polyelectrolyte ( pmp ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our system consist of long cylindric polyions , spherical counterions , monovalent salt , and divalent salt , inside the volume @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the polyions , of length @xmath1 , have diameter @xmath2 and charge @xmath3 uniformly distributed along the length of the cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between the charged groups is @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the counterions and coions are modeled as rigid spheres of diameter @xmath5 and charge @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 located at their centers . </S>",
    "<S> we shall not distinguish between the monovalent counterions derived from the polymers or salt , and assume that all the salt is dissociated . similarly , to simplify calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we shall treat the coions derived from the monovalent and the divalent salts as being identical . </S>",
    "<S> the solvent is modeled as a continuum medium of dielectric constant @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the distance of closest approach , @xmath10 , between a polyion and a counterion is @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this represents the  exclusion cylinder \" due to the hard - core repulsion .    the strong electrostatic attraction existing between the macromolecules and the counterions results in some number of counterions becoming associated with the polyions , producing clusters composed of _ one _ polyion , @xmath12 monovalent counterions , and @xmath13 divalent counterions . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we expect that there shall be a distribution of cluster sizes . motivated , however , by our previous work @xcite we know that the polydispersity in cluster sizes is not very important , if one is interested in thermodynamics of a polyelectrolyte solution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since not all of the counterions condense onto the polyions , for any non - zero temperature some free , unassociated , counterions remain in the solution . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the density of unassociated monovalent counterions as @xmath14 , and the density of unassociated divalent counterions as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the densities of the polyions , the monovalent salt , and the divalent salt respectively . </S>",
    "<S> since the coions do not participate in association their density remains unchanged , @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of the theory is to determine the characteristic cluster size , i.e. the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> complete thermodynamic information about the system is contained in its helmholtz free energy . </S>",
    "<S> the condition that the free energy must be minimum allows us to determine the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> once this is done , all the thermodynamic functions of the system can be found through the appropriate operations on the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the pressure inside the polyelectrolyte solution is a legendre transform of the helmholtz free energy density @xmath20 , given by @xmath21 , where the chemical potential of a specie of type @xmath22 ( clusters , counterions , and coions ) is @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> the free energy can not be calculated exactly . </S>",
    "<S> we shall , therefore , attempt to construct it as a sum of the most relevant contributions . </S>",
    "<S> these can be divided into an electrostatic and an entropic ones . </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic contribution arises as the result of polyion - counterion , polyion - polyion , and the counterion - coion interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the entropic contribution is the result of mixing of various species @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the free energy for the polyion - counterion interaction is calculated in the framework of the debye - hckel ( dh ) theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the full calculation is presented in ref.@xcite and here we shall just quote the result ,    @xmath24   - i(\\kappa a ) + \\frac { ( \\kappa a)^2 } { 2 } \\right\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the reduced temperature , @xmath27 , and    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the bessel function of order @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the modification of replacing the total microion density by _ </S>",
    "<S> twice _ the ionic strength , @xmath31 , is necessary when discussing multivalent salts .    </S>",
    "<S> the contribution to the free energy due to the interactions among the various free ions is given by the usual dh theory @xcite ,    @xmath32    the free , unassociated , counterions and coions screen the polyion - polyion interactions , producing an effective potential of short range . </S>",
    "<S> the polyion - polyion contribution to the free energy can then be calculated using a van der waals type of approach @xcite . to this end </S>",
    "<S> the polyion - polyion contribution is expressed as a second virial term , averaged over the relative angle sustained by two molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the result is ,    @xmath33    the entropic contribution is found using the flory theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the increase in free energy due to mixing of various species is the sum of their ideal free energies ,    @xmath34 \\ , , \\ ] ]    where , in obvious notation , the respective volume fractions are ,    @xmath35    @xmath36 is the internal partition function of an isolated specie @xmath22 . for structureless particles , @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of @xmath38 , proceeds along the lines given in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that to a good accuracy the internal partition function of a cluster can be approximated by    @xmath39 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the binding fractions are , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is    @xmath43 -z + 1 \\ , , \\ ] ]    where @xmath44 is the digamma function and @xmath45 is the manning parameter @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * 3 . results and conclusions *    adding the above contributions we obtain the full helmholtz free energy for the polyelectrolyte plus salt system , @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> minimization of the free energy allows us to find the number of condensed monovalent and divalent counterions , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in fig.@xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> we show the dependence of the binding fractions on the density of divalent salt , at fixed polyion and monovalent salt concentrations . at low densities of divalent salt , </S>",
    "<S> the condensation is dominated by the monovalent ions , since the divalent ions gain more entropy , and thus lower the total free energy , by staying free . </S>",
    "<S> however as the concentration of divalent salt increases , the gain in electrostatic energy due to condensation wins over the entropy and more divalent ions become associated with the macromolecules . </S>",
    "<S> we note that unlike the association with the ionic surfactants , which exhibits a large degree of cooperativity characterized by the sharp rise in the surfactant binding fraction , the replacement of the condensed monovalent counterions by the divalent counterions proceeds quite smoothly .    </S>",
    "<S> = 8.cm    </S>",
    "<S> this result could have been anticipated _ a priori_. the presence of a condensed divalent counterion does not stimulate any further condensation of additional particles , but on the contrary , the electrostatic repulsion between the like - charged counterions tends to inhibit any further association . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is quite different in the case of binding by the ionic surfactants . </S>",
    "<S> after the first amphiphile is associated , the condensation of additional molecules is energetically favored since the buildup of the hydrocarbon density in the vicinity of a polyion helps to exclude water and , thus , reduces the unfavorable hydrophobic energy of the alkyl tails . </S>",
    "<S> this , then , explains why the association with ionic surfactant and lipids exhibits a large degree of cooperativity while the binding of divalent counterions proceeds in a completely uncooperative fashion .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , using the number of associated ions , the osmotic pressure , defined as @xmath48 , can be computed as a function of divalent salt density ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 ) . </S>"
