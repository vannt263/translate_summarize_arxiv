    "spitzer _ from the outflow of ngc 2071 @xcite and studied with shock models by @xcite .",
    "the significance of water arises primary due to its importance as a coolant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "water observations serve as an important tool for studying long - sought details of the planet formation process @xcite .",

    "are needed , but also key are the availability and accuracy of collisional rate coefficients .",
    "collisional state - to - state rate coefficients are of great importance to describe energy exchange processes responsible for thermal balance and line formation , particularly in low - density gas . in such situations , the molecular level populations may be out of equilibrium or driven to non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) via external energy sources .",
    "most studies of collisional excitation begin with the consideration of he impact as the resulting collisional complex is weakly bound and of lower dimensionality . as such , the h@xmath0o - he collisional system has been investigated in a number of experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies . for numerical astrophysical models , quantitative determinations of state - to - state rate coefficients for collisions of water",
    "are crucial .    as direct measurements of collisional rate coefficients",
    "are generally difficult , numerical models often rely on calculations .",
    "however , other types are measurements can be performed to give some insight to the process and the reliability of calculations .",
    "for example , pressure broadening of five transitions of water due to helium and molecular hydrogen was investigated for temperatures relevant to the cold interstellar medium by @xcite . in the case of he , they found a significant temperature dependence which is in agreement with results deduced from previous theoretical inelastic studies .",
    "the situation for h@xmath0 is less satisfactory and requires further study both experimentally and theoretically ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "recently , state - to - state differential cross section ( dcs ) measurements have been performed for rotational excitation of water by he and h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the experimental data were compared to dcs calculations obtained with the close - coupling method using the potential energy surfaces ( pess ) for h@xmath0o - he @xcite and h@xmath0o - h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "very good agreement was found for most transitions providing some confidence in the reliability of the adopted pess .",
    "four pess @xcite have been developed recently for the h@xmath0o - he complex .",
    "the potentials of @xcite and @xcite were constructed using symmetry - adapted perturbation theory ( sapt ) , referred to as sapt - h and sapt - p , respectively .",
    "@xcite reported their potential based on valence bond ( vb ) calculations .",
    "detailed comparison of the dynamic performance on the first three potentials , sapt - h , sapt - p , and vb , was performed by @xcite , who concluded that the sapt - p potential @xcite was likely the most reliable .",
    "the pes of @xcite is expected to be of a similar quality , but has not been adopted in scattering calculations to the best of our knowledge .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the previous rotational quenching calculations of @xcite to higher levels of rotational excitation primarily utilizing the sapt - p @xcite pes for both para- and ortho - water .",
    "- he rate coefficients are presented for a large range of temperature which will be applicable to modeling a wide variety of astrophysical and atmospheric environments .",
    "the theory for scattering of a asymmetric top , such as h@xmath0o , with a spherical atom can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the center of the coordinate system is fixed at the center of mass of h@xmath0o .",

    "h@xmath0o is take to be rigid with the o - h bonds and h - o - h angle fixed at their equilibrium positions .",
    "the interaction then depends only on the position of the he atom which is described in the usual polar coordinates : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . for the scattering calculations ,",
    "it is convenient to expand the angle dependence of the potential @xmath25 in spherical harmonics @xmath26 as : @xmath27.\\ ] ] owing to the @xmath28 symmetry of water , only even values of @xmath29 enter the expansion .",
    "the rotational levels of h@xmath0o are labeled by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the @xmath33 quantum numbers in the prolate and oblate limits .",

    "the calculations presented in this paper were performed by applying the close - coupling ( cc ) approach and the coupled - states ( cs ) approximation ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * ) and using the sapt - p pes , except where noted .",
    "the cc method was used to calculate rotational quenching cross sections for center - of - mass kinetic energies from 10@xmath15 to 450 @xmath17 , while the cs approximation was used from 500 to 10,000 @xmath17 .",
    "all the cc and cs calculations were performed using the nonreactive scattering code molscat @xcite . in the quantum scattering calculations ,",
    "the coupled - channel equations were integrated using the modified log - derivative airy propagator of @xcite with a variable step - size .",

    ", water exists in two forms : para - h@xmath0o and ortho - h@xmath0o .",
    "the ortho- and para - levels do not interconvert in nonreactive collisions and are therefore treated separately in the current inelastic calculations .",

    "the agreement between cc and cs calculations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is found to be excellent .",
    "we conclude that the cs approximation , which is computationally efficient , is reliable for the current collision system at high energies .    from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] it can be seen that the cross sections display resonances in the intermediate energy region from 0.1 to 100 @xmath17 due to the influence of the attractive part of the interaction potential .",
    "the energy location and magnitude of the resonances are sensitive to the details of the pes as shown in @xcite .",
    "importantly , for astrophysical applications , the properties of the resonances influence the quenching rate coefficients at low temperatures as discussed below .",
    "the 3@xmath50 2@xmath2 transition is seen to dominant the quenching of the 3@xmath4 level and likewise for para - h@xmath0o , the dominant quenching transition for the 3@xmath11 is 3@xmath51 2@xmath9 .",
    "both transitions are seen to obey the propensity rule @xmath52 .    as a test of the accuracy of our results",
    ", we can compare to the recent measurements and calculations of @xcite . in their work , relative dcs measurements of h@xmath0o state - to - state excitation due to he impact were performed at a kinetic energy of 429 @xmath17 for 12 different transitions .",
    "differential and integral cross sections were also computed using molscat , but with the sapt - h pes .",
    "they found good agreement between theory and measurement in all cases except for the @xmath53 and @xmath54 transitions @xcite .",
    "as these transitions are weak ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , the authors argued that the discrepancy may be due to contamination of their beam of ground state molecules ( @xmath55 ) with excited @xmath56 water . for four dominant transitions ,",
    "the relative dcss were used to obtain relative integral cross sections which the authors normalized to the largest absolute cross section from their calculations , @xmath57 .",

    "[ fig3 ] are the current calculations using the sapt - p pes , as well as new results using the sapt - h and vb surfaces , all performed at a kinetic energy of 429 @xmath17 . as noted in @xcite , the vb surface gives cross sections that typically differ significantly with results obtained on other surfaces and with available experimental data .",
    "this is further confirmed in the present work and with comparison to the @xcite measurements .",
    "for all considered transitions , the current calculations using the sapt - h and sapt - p pess result in similar cross sections .",
    "this is consistent with the study performed in @xcite which had difficulty in selecting a preferred pes between the two .",
    "significant differences between the current calculations and those of @xcite are noted , even though both sets of calculations adopted the same surface ( sapt - h ) and the same scattering code . for the current calculations ,",
    "all parameters were carefully checked to ensure convergence and we can offer no explanation for the difference . finally , the agreement with experiment , regardless of normalization selection , is seen to be excellent for all the calculations for all adopted surfaces ( except , of course , for the vb surface ) .",
    "the one exception occurs for the transition @xmath60 .",
    "@xcite do not comment on this discrepancy and we can only speculate that their beam of @xmath61 molecules may have been contaminated by other low - lying excited states which may have influenced the cross section measurement given its relatively small magnitude . we conclude that the current calculations using the sapt - p surface gives results of sufficient reliability for astrophysical needs .",
    "state - to - state cross sections from each initial state are summed over all final states to obtain the total deexcitation cross section . in fig .",

    "unfortunately , we are unaware of any experimental rate coefficient data for rotational transitions of h@xmath0o due to collisions with he",
    ". therefore , we can only compare our computations with the theoretical results of @xcite , which were calculated with the potential of @xcite .",

    "further , the bumps in the present rate coefficients are absent from the results of green et al .",
    ", likely due to resonances not produced for scattering on the @xcite pes .    considering scattering of para - h@xmath0o by he , the trends noted for ortho - h@xmath0o are also evident in the state - to - state deexcitation rate coefficients as shown in figs .",

    "as discussed in the introduction , water has been observed in emission and absorption in a variety of astronomical environments .",
    "for example , in the past decade there has been increasing interest in the properties of protoplanetary disks ( ppds ) and considerable effort has gone into the modeling of ppds in general and the spectral features of water , in particular @xcite .",
    "the observation of water in ppds has become very common @xcite with interest focused on the inner - planet forming region .",
    "@xcite point out that water is one of dominant coolants in the inner regions .    because the critical densities of water are typically greater than 10@xmath65 @xmath66 , models which assume a boltzmann level population distribution , or local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , are generally not valid .",
    "full nlte models are necessary to predict the rotational and vibrational spectrum of water in most emitting regions of ppds , above the plane of the disk , as demonstrated by @xcite and in a variety of other environments .",
    "nlte models require knowledge of state - to - state rotational ( and vibrational ) rate coefficients for the kinetic modeling of the internal level populations .",
    "important colliders may include h@xmath0 , h , he , h@xmath67 , and e@xmath68 , and for comets h@xmath0o @xcite .",
    "a review of the status of collisional rate coefficients for water can be found in @xcite .",
    "because of the complexity in considering h@xmath0 collisions , there is a long history of initial collisional excitation calculations being performed with he collisions .",
    "the he rate coefficients are then often mass - scaled to emulate para - h@xmath0 collisions .",
    "we certainly _ do not _ advocate such a procedure here and it has been pointed out by @xcite that mass - scaling does not result in reliable h@xmath0o - h@xmath0 rate coefficients . as a consequence , a considerable amount of effort has been expended to directly compute rate coefficients for rotational excitation of water by h@xmath0 @xciteo - h@xmath0 , the latest state - to - state rate coefficients of @xcite , with a package to calculate effective and thermal rates , can be found on basecol . ] , while the rate coefficients for vibrational excitation are limited to the quasi - classical calculations of @xcite , with extrapolations proposed by @xcite .",
    "we are unaware of any collisional data for h@xmath67 impact , we have performed some preliminary calculations for h collisions ( yang & stancil , in preparation ) , while @xcite have compiled the available electron collision data . however , except for the set of calculations done for temperatures between 20 and 2000 k by @xcite on the earlier , and presumably less accurate pes of @xcite , our previous work @xcite , and the small set of calculations in support of the experiments of @xcite , no other computations for rate coefficients due to he impact have been published .",
    "therefore , the current rate coefficient calculations , which extend from 10@xmath69  k to 3000  k , are the most comprehensive to date for he and can be utilized in a variety of applications augmenting the datasets developed for h@xmath0 and electrons ( see also , the lamda website and basecol website , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that in nlte models of water in ppds , @xcite mass - scaled the available h@xmath0o - h@xmath0 rate coefficients to estimate values for h@xmath0o - he .",
    "cross sections and rate coefficients for rotational quenching of ortho- and para - h@xmath0o due to he collisions have been studied using the close - coupling method and the coupled - states approximation on the ab initio potential energy surface of @xcite .",

    "numerous orbiting resonances result in undulations in the temperature dependence of the rate coefficients . for temperatures less than @xmath64200  k ,",
    "the current state - to - state rotational rate coefficients are found to depart from the results of @xcite obtained with the earlier pes of @xcite .",

    "<S> theoretical rotational quenching cross sections and rate coefficients of ortho- and para - h@xmath0o due to collisions with he atoms are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the complete angular momentum close - coupling approach as well as the coupled - states approximation for angular momentum decoupling were applied to solve the scattering problem for a large range of rotationally - excited states of water . </S>",
    "<S> results are obtained for quenching from initial levels 1@xmath1 , 2@xmath2 , 2@xmath3 , 3@xmath4 , 3@xmath2 , 3@xmath3 , 4@xmath5 , 3@xmath6 , and 4@xmath7 of ortho - h@xmath0o and from initial levels 1@xmath8 , 2@xmath9 , 2@xmath8 , 2@xmath10 , 3@xmath11 , 3@xmath12 , 4@xmath13 , 4@xmath11 , and 3@xmath14 of para - h@xmath0o for kinetic energies from 10@xmath15 to 10@xmath16 @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> state - to - state and total deexcitation cross sections and rate coefficients for temperatures between 0.1 and 3000 k are reported . </S>",
    "<S> the present state - to - state rate coefficients are found to be in good agreement with previous results obtained by green and coworkers at high temperatures , but significant discrepancies are obtained at lower temperatures likely due to differences in the adopted potential energy surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> astrophysical applications of the current rate coefficients are briefly discussed . </S>"
