    "since the pioneering paper of wilson @xcite a real breakthrough opened in the treatment of quark states and in this framework a lot of work was devoted to the study of the heavy @xmath1 .",
    "the challenge was understanding low energy qcd dynamics and hence confinement .",
    "the main characteristics of the heavy meson and baryon spectrum are simple and cleanly connected to expectation value of the @xmath1 and @xmath4 potentials .",
    "the size of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 systems extends over distances where confinement already plays a relevant role ( only toponium can be described purely in terms of one gluon exchange plus higher order perturbative corrections @xcite but , as well - known , we can not access its spectrum ) ; moreover , due to the mean value of the quark velocities , the leading relativistic corrections can be appreciated and usefully tested on the data .",
    "furthermore , a good understanding of the heavy quark semirelativistic interaction is the first step towards relativistic generalization .    at the static level",
    ", the linear confining @xmath1 interaction , corresponding to a constant energy density ( the string tension @xmath7 ) localized in a flux tube between the quarks , emerges in lattice formulation of qcd and is contained in all the existing confining models , e.g. , wilson area law , flux tube model and all kind of dielectric and dual models .",
    "this corresponds also to the static limit of the buchmller s picture @xcite of a rotating quark - antiquark state connected by a purely chromoelectric tube with a pure transverse velocity and with chromomagnetic field vanishing in the comoving system of the tube . in this picture",
    "it follows simply that the non - perturbative spin - interaction is given only by the thomas precession term .",
    "the spin - dependent relativistic corrections were calculated first by eichten , feinberg @xcite and gromes @xcite as a correction to the static limit ( wilson  brown  weisberger area law result ) .",
    "the potential is expressed in terms of average of electric and magnetic fields that can also be calculated on the lattice .",
    "the eichten  feinberg ",
    "gromes results , at least in the long range behaviour , have been reproduced on the lattice @xcite ( for a detailed discussion see sec .",
    "recently the spin - dependent potential was also studied in the context of the heavy quark effective theory @xcite .    in the literature relativistic generalizations of these results",
    "were attempted in a bethe ",
    "salpeter context by constructing a bethe  salpeter kernel which give back static and spin - dependent potentials . using a simple convolution kernel ( i.e. depending only on the momentum transfer @xmath8 ) ,",
    "this amounts to considering a lorentz scalar proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "the velocity dependent relativistic corrections were also obtained but they are strongly dependent on the type of  instantaneous \" approximation chosen to define the potential and on the gauge . these non - perturbative velocity dependent corrections destroy the agreement with the data @xcite and give origin to the puzzle of how reconciling the spin - structure ( i.e. the lorentz nature of the kernel ) with the velocity corrections in one bethe ",
    "salpeter kernel . in this paper",
    "we will not deal with this problem starting directly from the @xmath2 expansion of the potential without any relativistic assumption .",
    "however a first step in its resolution seems to be the correct inclusion of the low energy dynamics also in the spin - independent @xmath2 corrections .",
    "moreover from the knowledge of these and the spin dependent corrections we will obtain some important insights on the nature of the kernel .    recently a method to obtain the complete @xmath2 quark  antiquark ( and 3 quarks ) potential , based on the path integral representation of the pauli  type quark propagator , was given in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this formulation is gauge invariant .",
    "the potential is obtained as a function of a generalized wilson loop ( i.e. any kind of trajectory for the quark and the antiquark can appear ) and its functional derivatives .",
    "these are all measurable on the lattice . in short",
    "it was obtained a constituent quark semirelativistic interaction with coefficients determined by the non linear gluodynamics .",
    "this is the ideal framework in which to formulate hypothesis on the wilson loop behaviour ( and so on the confinement mechanism ) to be checked on the lattice and on the experimental data .",
    "first , to evaluate the non - perturbative behaviour of the wilson loop , a modified minimal area law ( mal ) was used ( see sec . 3 ) .",
    "this reproduces the eichten ",
    "gromes results @xcite and gives a velocity dependent potential proportional to the flux tube angular momentum squared , so that , by including velocity dependent corrections , a `` string model '' emerges ( see @xcite ) .",
    "also the velocity dependent potentials seem to agree with recent available lattice data @xcite .",
    "however , the mal represents an extreme approximation that gives the correct result for very large interquark distances and does not give insight into open problems such as the relation between the non - perturbative structure of spin and velocity corrections . for these reasons",
    "we have taken into account two models of confinement , the stochastic vacuum model ( svm ) and dual qcd ( dqcd ) which both give an expression for the whole behaviour of the wilson loop and contain the area law in the long distances limit .",
    "it is interesting to realize that both models reproduce essentially the perturbative plus mal results respectively in the limit of short and long distances but produce also subleading corrections .",
    "these allows us to understand better the physical picture .",
    "for example in the case of the non - perturbative spin - orbit interaction it turns out that the magnetic term cancels in the area law limit ( zero magnetic field in the comoving framework ) but presents @xmath3 suppressed corrections in the other two models .",
    "a careful comparison between the svm and dqcd corrections and an investigation of the approximations in which they coincide seem to be of great importance to the aim of understanding the low energy gluodynamics contained in the wilson loop .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following one . in sec .",
    "2 we briefly sum up the definition of the semirelativistic potential and the notations . in sec .",
    "3 we collect the results obtained in the mal model . in sec .",
    "4 we briefly present the svm and use it to evaluate the potential in the context of sec .",
    "in particular we obtain also the svm velocity dependent potential which is new .",
    "we show that it satisfies important identities and we give the short and long - range limits . in sec .",
    "5 we introduce the dqcd potential and discuss the long - range limit . in sec .",
    "6 we discuss our results in connection with the up to now available lattice data and draw some conclusions .",
    "in @xcite a foldy  wouthuysen transformation on the quark - antiquark green s function was done and the result was written as a feynman path integral over particle and anti - particle coordinates and momenta of a lagrangian depending only upon the spin , coordinates , and momenta of the quark and antiquark . separating off the kinetic terms from this lagrangian it was possible to identify the heavy quark potential @xmath10 ( closed loops of light quark pairs and annihilation contributions",

    "( [ v0dqcd])-([v1dqcd ] ) with ( [ vsosvm ] ) if follows immediately that in the long - range behaviour the static and the spin - orbit potentials coincide completely in dqcd and in the svm .",
    "very important seems to be the agreement , which we note here for the first time , between the @xmath3 corrections in the two models .",
    "these corrections come from the physics beyond the minimal area law assumption and in fact there are not present in the mal model ( see ( [ vsmal ] ) ) .",
    "the coefficient of the @xmath3 contribution in @xmath194 and @xmath195 is the same in dqcd and svm and in both cases compatible with the constant term in the static potential @xmath38 .",
    "the little difference between the constant in @xmath194 , @xmath196 and @xmath38 can be understood in the svm language as due to the presence of the small positive constant @xmath197 .",
    "the spin - spin interaction falls off exponentially in both the models . in dqcd",
    "the behaviour is like a yukawa interaction , while eqs .",
    "( [ v3svm])-([v4svm ] ) seem not to reproduce this behaviour at least with parametrization ( [ dlr])-([d1lr ] ) .",
    "this is , at the moment , an important disagreement because one of the basic feature of dqcd is that the magnetic interaction ( like in the spin - spin case ) is carried by a massive particle .",
    "differences arise for large distances also in the velocity dependent sector and with respect to the mal model .",
    "the factors in front of the @xmath198 leading contributions to @xmath126 , ... , @xmath64 are slightly different from those of eqs .",
    "( [ vdmal ] ) .",
    "the potentials @xmath126 , @xmath199 and @xmath64 present some additional constant terms which do not arise from the area law .",
    "finally there are not @xmath3 corrections as in the svm . some of these discrepancies can be interpreted as due to a finite thickness of the flux tube in dqcd opposite to the infinitely thin flux tube in the mal model @xcite .",
    "therefore in the two models the flux tube will have a different moment of inertia and give slightly different contributions to the velocity dependent potential .",
    "it is possible that these discrepancies will disappear if including higher order cumulants contributions in the svm predictions .",
    "other differences between the predictions of the two methods could have origin from the very delicate interpolating procedure of the numerical solutions of the dqcd non - linear equations .",
    "the very soon available lattice results on the velocity dependent potentials @xcite will possibly clarify the situation .",
    "using the same gauge invariant and physically transparent approach to calculate the complete semirelativistic quark - antiquark interaction for three different models ( mal , svm and dqcd ) we have shown the following points .",
    "* we have obtained the velocity dependent corrections in the svm model which are new and present an interesting non - perturbative structure .",
    "* we have demonstrated that the minimal area law model is exactly reproduced in both the spin dependent and the velocity dependent sector of the potential by the long - range behaviour of the stochastic vacuum model .",
    "from now we can consider the mal model simply as the @xmath135 limit of the svm for heavy quarks .",
    "moreover this limit realizes also the intuitive buchmller s picture of zero magnetic field in the flux tube comoving system .",
    "* in the spin dependent sector of the potential , both the svm and dqcd not only reproduce the long - range behaviour given by the area law , but also give @xmath3 corrections to @xmath145 and @xmath144 .",
    "these corrections are equal in both models and very near to the absolute value of the constant term in the static potential ( the svm also supplies for the explication of this fact ) .",
    "this perfect agreement is absolutely not trivial and seems to be very meaningful , since it arises from two very different models in a region of distances in which the physics can not be described by the area law alone .",
    "this is also remarkable to understand the kind of effective kernel that would describe the non - perturbative bound - states of constituent quarks .",
    "for example , it seems now clear that the vanishing of the magnetic part , given by the field average of eq .",
    "( [ vmag ] ) , in the non - perturbative region takes place only at the leading level in the long - range limit .",
    "therefore , working in a bethe ",
    "salpeter context , there is no need to assume an effective pure convolution kernel which is a lorentz scalar ( a recent proposed bethe  salpeter kernel can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "* velocity dependent contributions to the quark - antiquark potential are important .",
    "in fact the string behaviour of the non - perturbative interaction shows up when we consider the velocity dependent part of the potential @xcite and this is also what the data require @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the velocity dependent part using equation ( [ potential ] ) and the svm is completely gauge invariant and seems not to suffer from the problems connected with the strong reduction dependence of the potentials obtained from bethe  salpeter kernels . in this way",
    "we reproduce the area law results and give a lot of new @xmath3 and @xmath147 corrections , suppressed in the long - range behaviour .",
    "the velocity dependent structure which arises from the dqcd model differs slightly in the coefficients with respect to the area law behaviour .",
    "the main reason seems to be that the flux tube in dqcd has a finite thickness .",
    "it is possible that higher order cumulants can reabsorb this difference . * the spin dependent potentials",
    "have first been evaluated on the lattice .",
    "the data in @xcite confirm the long - range behaviour given in ( [ vsmal ] ) and contained also in ( [ vsosvm ] ) and ( [ v0dqcd])-([v2dqcd ] ) .",
    "recent data @xcite show up the same long - range behaviour and do not yet allow to distinguish between parametrizations which differ at the next - to - leading order in the distance @xmath146 .",
    "however they contain more information about the short - range region of the interaction ( typically below the correlation length of 0.2 fm ) .",
    "generally the data reproduce the perturbative results ( which at the first order in @xmath134 can be read from ( [ vsmal ] ) putting @xmath7 equal 0 ) . the only exception is given by the short distance behaviour of @xmath145 which seems to be negative and proportional to @xmath147 .",
    "this contradicts the order @xmath200 calculation of the @xmath201 potential ( which contains the first non vanishing perturbative contribution to @xmath145 ) given for example by pantaleone and tye @xcite .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy could be explained by higher order perturbative contributions or by some at the moment unknown short range non - perturbative contribution ( in the language of the svm this contribution could arise from the correlation function @xmath115 ; an investigation in this sense of the recent short - range data on @xmath115 given in the last reference quoted in @xcite is going on ) . the problem is still open .",
    "only recently some data on the velocity dependent potentials appeared @xcite .",
    "probably more accurate data will be available in the next months .",
    "these results seem to confirm the long - range behaviour contained in ( [ vdmal ] ) ( @xmath7 dependent terms ) .",
    "more interesting is the case of the potential @xmath148 which appears to be different from zero for @xmath135 and show up a @xmath3 short - range behaviour .",
    "this behaviour has been recently explained in terms of svm and dqcd @xcite .    in conclusion",
    "svm and dqcd reproduce the flux tube distribution measured on the lattice and the general features coming from the area law .",
    "both give analytical expressions for the wilson loop ( eqs .",
    "( [ svm ] ) and ( [ weff ] ) ) which describe the evolving behaviour of @xmath202 from the short to the long distances ( we note that this can be useful in many different applications , see e.g. @xcite ) and both give some predictions which go beyond the asymptotic behaviour . but not all predictions are equal in the two models in the intermediate distances region , in particular in the velocity dependent sector of the potential , but also in the spin - spin interaction .",
    "therefore , new lattice data sensitive to such kind of corrections seem to be urgent . finally , work is in progress in evaluating the correlation function @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the dqcd context and in producing an extensive phenomenological analysis of the contribution of the new obtained potentials to the heavy and heavy - light quark spectrum .",
    "we would like to thank m. baker , a. di giacomo , h. g. dosch , d. gromes , g. m. prosperi , yu.a .",
    "simonov for enlightening conversations .",
    "we also warmly acknowledge the kind hospitality given by the members of the theoretical physics institut of heidelberg where part of this work was done .      in this appendix",
