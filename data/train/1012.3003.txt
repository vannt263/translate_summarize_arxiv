    "exactly solvable models in statistical physics and mathematical physics is one of the most challenging topics .",
    "recently several exactly solvable models were studied in quasi - one dimensional classical - quantum models such as ising - heisenberg models@xcite , as well as two - dimensional ising models and ising - heisenberg models@xcite , that can be mapped onto exactly solvable vertex models .",
    "although the decoration transformation was introduced in the fifty decade@xcite , in order to study the decorated spin models . due to a successful application of this approach , recently this method was extended for a general case of decoration transformation@xcite , later extended by strecka@xcite even for classical - quantum models such as ising - heisenberg models .",
    "recently another interesting application of decoration transformation was also investigated by pereira _",
    "et al_.@xcite where they considered a delocalized interstitial electrons on diamond - like chain and they also investigate the magnetocaloric effect in kinetically frustrated diamond chain@xcite , meanwhile strecka _ _ et al.__@xcite discussed the localized ising spins and itinerant electrons in two - dimensional models , as well as two - dimensional spin - electron with coulomb repulsion@xcite .    on the other hand studies of strongly correlated electron systems are certainly one of the most important areas of condensed matter physics . a large number of papers have been concerned with the investigation of heavy - fermion behavior , magnetism of strongly correlated systems , high temperature superconductivity , or metalinsulator transitions and charge - ordering phenomena .",
    "a limiting case of these systems could be the spinless fermion model , where the spin orientation could be ignored or it can be understand as a fully polarized system . the one - dimensional case of this model already was investigated by czart@xcite and zhuravlev _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "although spinless fermion models can be transformed onto xxz models in a magnetic field parallel to the anisotropy@xcite by the use of the well known jordan - wigner transformation , this kind of mapping could be more involving for the hubbard - like systems , where the spin orientation is considered .",
    "therefore , the purpose here is how to use the decoration transformation approach for interacting electron systems , without mapping onto spin models .",
    "the outline of this letter is as follow : in sec .",
    "2 we introduce the model to be studied . in sec .",
    "3 we present the phase diagram at zero temperature . in sec .",
    "4 is devoted the decoration transformation and transfer matrix approach , in order to obtain its exact solution . whereas in sec .",
    "5 is discussed the thermodynamics , particle density and correlation function of the model considered , and finally in sec . 6 we present our conclusions .",
    "schematic representation for spinless fermion model on diamond chain , by vertical solid line we represent a hopping term and coulomb repulsion between two sites , while by dashed line we represent only the coulomb repulsion term . ]",
    "the model we consider in this letter is the spinless fermion model on diamond chain as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : schm - chain ] , where by vertical solid line we mean the particle hopping term and coulomb repulsion term , while by dashed line we represent only the coulomb term repulsion . therefore the hamiltonian for spinless fermion model on diamond chain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schm - chain ] ) , can be expressed by    @xmath0    with @xmath1 being the number of unit cell , whereas @xmath2 is given by    @xmath3    where @xmath4 are fermi annihilation ( creation ) operators for spinless ( or completely polarized ) fermion respectively , with @xmath5 , while @xmath6 being number operators .",
    "the hamiltonian parameter @xmath7 is the hopping term ( solid lines ) , @xmath8 is the chemical potential , and the coulomb repulsion term between fermions on neighboring sites ( dashed lines ) is represented @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we also consider a periodic boundary condition .",
    "the spinless fermion model on diamond chain , has an important particlehole symmetry@xcite . for the purpose of this discussion ,",
    "the following canonical transformation @xmath11 and @xmath12 was considered . for the occupation number operator",
    "the transformation reads @xmath13 , thus the transformed hamiltonian becomes@xmath14    the different signs of the hopping term on sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be compensated by a further canonical transformation as follows . by formally replacing say @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) for @xmath15 sites , but keeping unchanged the operators on sites @xmath16 , or vice - versa .    on the other hand , using the jordan - wigner transformation it is possible to map the spinless fermion diamond chain onto a ising - heisenberg diamond chain with non - uniform external magnetic field , as discussed in reference@xcite , the @xmath19-component of the spin-1/2 operator is related to number operator by @xmath20 , while the creation ( annihilation ) operators are related through @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the models are related through the relations @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the hamiltonian of spinless fermion model on diamond chain , has not been discussed yet anywhere . in this sense discussing this model",
    ", we could be opening several variants of fermion models and the most interesting models are the extended hubbard - like models@xcite with decorated interactions , where is taking into account the spin orientation , that is why it is interesting first to discuss the spinless fermion model .",
    "considering the state vectors , where hopping term @xmath7 is acting at sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in each state",
    "there are only two possibilities labeled by 0 or 1 , it means an empty or occupied particle state respectively , this leads to the following state vector @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are the coefficients to be determined for each state .    the states acting on hamiltonian at sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 for each elementary cell becomes ,    @xmath30|0,1\\rangle - t|1,0\\rangle,\\label{eq:01}\\\\ \\boldsymbol{h}_{i , i+1}|1,0\\rangle= & \\left[\\left(\\frac{v}{2}-\\frac{\\mu}{2}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{n}_{c , i}+\\boldsymbol{n}_{c , i+1}\\right)-\\mu\\right]|1,0\\rangle - t|0,1\\rangle,\\label{eq:10}\\\\ \\boldsymbol{h}_{i , i+1}|1,1\\rangle= & \\left[\\left(v-\\frac{\\mu}{2}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{n}_{c , i}+\\boldsymbol{n}_{c , i+1}\\right)+v_{1}-2\\mu\\right]|1,1\\rangle.\\label{eq:11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after diagonalize the above @xmath31 matrix we have 4 eigenvalues , these eigenvalues depends only on the number of operators @xmath32 , along with the hamiltonian parameters .",

    "although there are 16 eigenvalues only four possible ground states energies were found , whose eigenvectors for different phases are given by    @xmath35 corresponds to the particles states at sites @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath36 , respectively.@xmath37    phase diagram of spinless fermion model on diamond chain as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , for fixed values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 . ]",
    "the ground state phase diagram of @xmath9 as a function of @xmath8 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ph - dgm ] , for fixed values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the four states are limited as follow :    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    the first one is @xmath44 , this corresponds just to a simple empty lattice particle ( or fully - filled holes ) on diamond chain with total density @xmath45 ( yellow region ) .",
    "the second state is represented by @xmath46 , where one particle is at site @xmath15 or @xmath16 of the elementary cell , then the particle density for this state is @xmath47 ( green region ) .",
    "furthermore there is another state @xmath48 , this state corresponds to the configuration that one particle is fluctuating at sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 , whereas on site @xmath36 of elementary cell there is another particle , then the total density is @xmath49 ( red region ) .",
    "finally there is a fully - filled particle diamond chain state represented by @xmath50 with density @xmath51 , or it can also be understood as an empty lattice of hole state ( blue region ) .",
    "in order to study the thermodynamics properties of the spinless fermion model on diamond chain , it will be used the decoration transformation@xcite as described bellow .",
    "actually , it is not necessary to map the spinless fermion model onto spin models , like ising - heisenberg model@xcite . thus , there is an interest in performing the decoration transformation for operators . in this sense",
    "it will be apply directly the decoration transformation approach@xcite for the proposed model .",
    "the main aim to solve the hamiltonian of spinless fermion model on diamond chain is to map onto an effective spinless fermion model without hopping term , whose hamiltonian is given by    @xmath52,\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are coefficients to be determined using decoration transformation@xcite .",
    "the boltzmann factor of effective spinless fermion model can be expressed as follow    @xmath55    where @xmath56 , with @xmath57 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath58 the absolute temperature .    on the other hand the boltzmann factors for the spinless fermion model on diamond chain given for the hamiltonian reads as    @xmath59    the operators @xmath60 ranges from 0 to 1",
    ", then we have explicitly the boltzmann factors ,    @xmath61    for simplicity the boltzmann factor for diamond chain are denoted by @xmath62 , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "in order to apply decoration transformation we need to impose the following condition :    @xmath65    the boltzmann factor for both systems must be equal in order to satisfy the decoration transformation@xcite .",
    "thus there are three unknown algebraic equations and three unknown parameters , this algebraic system is solved easily using the decoration transformation method , whose solutions are written as    @xmath66    where the @xmath67 , @xmath54 and @xmath53 are expressed as a functions of the original parameters of the hamiltonian by means of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the boltzmann factor for effective spinless fermion model reads as    @xmath71    with being @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    in what follows ,",
    "we are interested to solve the effective spinless fermion without hoping term ( also known as the atomic limit ) , to solve this effective model it will be used the transfer matrix method@xcite , given by    @xmath74    note that the terms @xmath54 and @xmath53 can be obtained in a similar way as were obtained for spin models .",
    "the eigenvalues of transfer matrix are given by @xmath37@xmath75 .",
    "using the largest eigenvalues @xmath76 of the transfer matrix @xmath58 , we obtain the partition function per site of the model in terms of the effective spinless fermion model in atomic limit @xmath77 with @xmath78 is the partition function for effective spinless fermion without hopping term .",
    "the partition function per elementary cell , is expressed in terms of the boltzmann factors for the spinless fermion model on diamond chain , may be written    @xmath79    from the partition function of spinless fermion model on diamond chain , it is possible to obtain the free energy by the relation @xmath80 .",
    "once known this result , we are ready to study several physical amounts such as entropy , specific heat , average energy and so on .",
    "so far , we have not yet specified the particles number of the diamond chain . in order to obtain the electron density per elementary cell , we take the derivative of free energy in relation to the chemical potential of spinless fermion on diamond chain@xmath81 here we are assuming the exchange invariance of sites @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    ".    the particle density of type @xmath36 can be obtained from effective spinless fermion model , by the relation@xmath82 whereas the particle density for sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 per site , can be obtained combining eqs . and ,",
    "resulting in @xmath83    further we illustrate the chemical potential behavior for fixed values of @xmath38 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens&mu](a - b ) we display the density @xmath86 as a function of chemical potential @xmath8 , for a range of temperatures @xmath87 , 0.4 , 0.1 and 0.01 , this behavior is in agreement with phase transition at zero temperature ( fig . [",
    "fig : ph - dgm ] ) discussed previously .",
    "we show three plateaus at low temperature , when @xmath86 becomes 1 , 2 or 3 .",
    "the size of plateau at density @xmath49 is proportional the parameter @xmath10 , for small @xmath10 there is a short plateau ( fig.[fig : dens&mu](b ) ) , while for large @xmath10 long plateau is observed ( the last one not illustrated ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens&mu](c - d ) the amount @xmath88 versus @xmath8 is displayed , in order to study the average particles number behavior at sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 compared to that one on site @xmath36 .",
    "so for negative chemical potential we have @xmath89 , while for positive chemical potential we have @xmath90 .",
    "another interesting properties we would like to discuss is the symmetry particle - hole described by eqs must be satisfied only when @xmath39 , therefore we find the following relation for the free energy ,    @xmath91    in general , the chemical potential depends on the temperature , however at half - filled band particle density @xmath92 and under particle - hole symmetry relation , the chemical potential becomes independent of the temperature , given simply by @xmath93 . if we look at the phase diagram displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ph - dgm ] , the relation @xmath94 corresponds the phase transition between density @xmath47 and 2 , as expected the density in this region should be @xmath92 , due to the thermal fluctuation begins to act .    for several values of density @xmath86",
    "is displayed the chemical potential as a function of temperature , for half - filled band . ]    furthermore , in fig.[fig : mu - t ] the chemical potential as a function of the temperature for fixed values of density @xmath86 is displayed , from this plot we may conclude that there is a chemical potential independent on the temperature only at half - filled band and when symmetry particle - hole is satisfied .",
    "another interesting quantity we would like to comment is the correlation function , it can also be obtained using transfer matrix method@xcite , which after some algebraic manipulation we obtain ,    @xmath95    some other nearest correlation or expected values of higher order can be obtained , combining the derivative of diamond chain hamiltonian with respect to one of its parameter , and the decoration transformation for correlation function as discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "although the decoration transformation has originally been developed to study magnetic spin models@xcite , and since then , this method was widely applied to solve several decorated spin models .",
    "motivated by this successful application , this transformation later was generalized@xcite , and recently strecka@xcite extended even for ising - heisenberg spin models .",
    "however , there is no any approach developed for electron interacting systems , such as strongly correlated electron systems . in this sense , we discuss how the decoration transformation can also be used to map from one decorated electron system onto another effective electron system . as an illustrative application of decoration transformation for electron interacting models",
    ", it has been considered the spinless fermion model on diamond chain , where vertical solid line corresponds to hopping term and repulsive coulomb interaction term , while by dashed line we mean the repulsive coulomb interaction term between the nearest neighbor ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schm - chain ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we discuss some properties of this model , such as the phase diagram at zero temperature , showing four different states with a given number of particles , changing from empty lattice ( or fully - filled holes ) of particles to fully - filled particles ( or empty lattice of holes ) on the diamond chain .",
    "the thermodynamics of this model , allows to display the particle density as a function of chemical potential per elementary cell as well as the chemical potential as a function of temperature .",
    "finally an additional quantity also was considered such as the correlation function .",
