    "the search for photons in the ultra - high energy ( uhe ) cosmic - ray flux has been stimulated by the observation of cosmic rays with energies exceeding @xmath8 6@xmath910@xmath10  ev @xcite .",
    "if these particles are due to cosmologically distant sources , the flux spectrum is expected to steepen above this energy .",
    "intriguingly , a flux spectrum with no apparent steepening above @xmath11 has been reported by the agasa collaboration  @xcite . to account for this observation and to circumvent the theoretical challenge of explaining particle acceleration to such energies , models involving new physics",
    "have been proposed in which the cosmic rays are created at the observed energies at relatively close distances from the earth .",
    "these `` top - down '' models  @xcite may involve super heavy dark matter ( shdm )  @xcite , topological defects  @xcite , or neutrino interactions with the relic neutrino background ( z - bursts )  @xcite .",
    "a common feature of these models is the prediction of a substantial photon flux at highest energies .",
    "the auger collaboration has recently reported a measurement of the cosmic - ray spectrum from the auger south site showing a flux suppression above @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the auger method is based on a large surface array to collect the required statistics and a fluorescence detector to calibrate the energy scale .",
    "using this `` hybrid '' approach , the energy reconstruction is largely independent of hadronic interaction parameters and , in case of nuclear primaries , of the primary mass composition .",
    "however , as explained later , the energy assignment from surface arrays can be substantially altered in the case of primary photons .",
    "this would affect the reconstructed primary spectrum if a non - negligible number of the highest - energy events , where data from the fluorescence telescopes are sparse due to their @xmath1210% duty cylce , was actually due to photons ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the acceptance of fluorescence detectors ( as also applied in the hires experiment  @xcite ) can be altered in the case of photon primaries  @xcite .",
    "uhe photons can also act as tracers of the gzk ( greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ) process  @xcite of resonant photopion production of nucleons off the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the corresponding photon fluxes are sensitive to source features ( type of primary , injection spectrum , distance to sources ... ) and to propagation parameters ( extragalactic radio backgrounds and magnetic fields )  @xcite .",
    "thus , the search for primary photons remains an important subject for various reasons  @xcite , particularly    * to set significant limits to the possible contribution of top - down mechanisms to the primary cosmic - ray flux ; * to search for gzk photons , to prove the gzk effect and constrain source and propagation models ; * to establish the maximum photon fraction in the primary flux , for which the energy estimate in the surface array detector would be altered ; * to obtain input to fundamental physics , for instance , to probe quantum gravity effects in the electromagnetic sector  @xcite .",
    "showers initiated by uhe photons develop differently from showers induced by nuclear primaries .",
    "particularly , observables related to the development stage or `` age '' of a shower ( such as the depth of shower maximum @xmath13 and to the content of shower muons provide good sensitivity to identify primary photons .",
    "photon showers are expected to develop deeper in the atmosphere ( larger @xmath14 ) .",
    "this is connected to the smaller multiplicity in electromagnetic interactions compared to hadronic ones , such that a larger number of interactions is required to degrade the energy to the critical energy where the cascading process stops . additionally , the lpm effect  @xcite results in a suppression of the pair production and bremsstrahlung cross - sections .",
    "photon showers also contain fewer secondary muons , since photoproduction and direct muon pair production are expected to play only a sub - dominant role .",
    "searches for photons were previously conducted based on surface arrays  @xcite , and limits to the fraction of photons were reported ( see  @xcite for a review ) . the derivation of limits to the photon _",
    "fraction _ using surface array data alone is an experimental and conceptual challenge ( see also section  [ sec_energy ] ) .",
    "firstly , for conclusions on the fraction , the energy scales for photon _ and _ nuclear primaries are needed .",
    "these energy scales may differ from each other for surface arrays , and the difference between the scales may depend in a non - trivial way on primary parameters such as the shower zenith angle .",
    "secondly , the energy reconstruction of nuclear primaries suffers from substantial uncertainties due to our limited knowledge of high - energy hadron dynamics .",
    "both issues can be resolved using the fluorescence technique , which is near - calorimetric and largely independent of simulating hadron interactions .",
    "a corresponding approach has been developed and applied recently to obtain a first bound on the fraction of photons from data taken at the auger observatory  @xcite .    in this work , using the larger number of events recorded by the surface array , we derive for the first time a direct limit to the _ flux _ of photons by searching for photon candidates and relating their number to the well - known exposure of the surface array .",
    "this avoids the need of simulating events inititated by nuclear primaries ; only the photon energy scale is needed which can be simulated with much higher confidence .",
    "two observables of the surface detectors are chosen which have significantly different behavior for nuclear primaries when compared to photons : the risetime of the recorded shower signal and the radius of curvature of the shower front .",
    "we also derive a limit to the fraction of photons .",
    "while the challenge of using two energy scales remains for this part of the analysis , hadron simulations can still be avoided by using the hybrid calibration  @xcite to reconstruct the energies of the observed events .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec_go ] ,",
    "the observables used in the analysis and their relationship with the composition of cosmic rays are explained . in section  [ sec_photon ] ,",
    "the simulation of uhe photons is considered .",
    "the method developed to distinguish events which are photon candidates using observables of the surface detector is detailed in section  [ sec_method ] . in section  [ sec_results ] , the results are presented .",
    "the conclusions are given in section  [ sec_conclusions ] .",
    "the analysis in this paper is based on data taken during 21,400 hours of operation of the surface detector recorded in the period 1 january 2004 to 31 december 2006 .",
    "the surface detector , when completed , will have 1600 water cherenkov detectors spaced 1.5  km apart and covering @xmath123000  km@xmath15  @xcite . each water cherenkov detector , or station , is a cylinder 1.2  m in height and 3.6  m in diameter . each detector is lined with a reflective container that holds 12  tonnes of purified water and is fitted with three nine - inch photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) looking down into the water .    when a relativistic particle passes through a station , cherenkov radiation is emitted .",
    "the radiated photons then propagate through the water , being reflected at the station walls , and are either eventually absorbed or detected by a pmt .",
    "the signals from the pmts are digitised by a flash analog to digital converter ( fadc ) which samples the signal every 25  ns .",
    "these digitised signals are then transmitted to a central data acquisition system where event triggers are built .",
    "each event , then , has a detailed time profile @xmath16 of the energy deposited in each station @xmath17 at distance @xmath18 in the shower plane .",
    "the function @xmath19 depends in a complex way both on the parameters of the primary particle ( energy , type , direction ) and on the detector response to different secondary particles ( particularly the electromagnetic and muonic shower components ) .    in this work ,",
    "we extract two relatively simple but robust observables from these data , noting that the wealth of information contained in the time profiles can further be exploited in future work .",
    "the observables , the radius of curvature of the shower front and the risetime at 1000  m core distance , were found to provide good discrimination between photon and nuclear primaries ( see e.g.  also ref .",
    "in addition to the quantitative studies of these observables by means of the simulation - reconstruction chain , we will also sketch ( in a simplified way ) why these observables are indeed expected to differ between nuclear and photon primaries .      due to geometrical reasons , the arrival of the first particles at lateral distance @xmath20 from the axis is expected to be delayed with respect to an ( imaginary ) planar shower front ( see also fig .",
    "[ rise_distance ] , left plot ) . for a particle that is due to an earlier interaction at height @xmath21 along the shower axis and observed at @xmath20 , the delay from the longer path length can be approximated as @xmath22    the delay increases ( for @xmath23 about quadratically ) with @xmath20 .",
    "importantly , the delay decreases with increasing height @xmath21 .",
    "air showers with the first ground particles coming from relatively large heights will have smaller delays @xmath24 at fixed distance @xmath20 compared to showers where the registered particles originated from smaller heights . compared to primary photons ,",
    "showers from nuclear primaries develop higher in the atmosphere ( smaller @xmath14 ) .",
    "additionally , shower muons ( much more abundant in showers from nuclear primaries ) can reach the ground from still higher altitudes further reducing the time delay .",
    "thus , for nuclear primaries smaller delays are expected compared to photon primaries .",
    "we make use of this relation by fitting a shower front ( abstract surface with convex curvature defined by the fastest shower particles ) to the measured trigger times @xmath25 of the first particles registered at distances @xmath18 . in the present study",
    ", the shape of the shower front is approximated using a spherical model ( in accord with eq .",
    "( [ t_eqn ] ) ) , and the radius of curvature @xmath26 of the shower front is obtained by minimizing @xmath27 in the function @xmath28 ^ 2}{c^2\\sigma_t^2 } \\label{curv_eqn}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the trigger time for station @xmath17 as defined in  @xcite , @xmath30 is the time of the shower in the center of curvature , @xmath31 is the unit vector along the shower axis , @xmath32 is the location of the station on the ground relative to the shower core , and @xmath33 is the uncertainty in the shower arrival time  @xcite . in the determination of @xmath29 ,",
    "a software filter is applied to reduce contributions from spurious signals not related to the actual shower .",
    "also the _ spread _ in time of the signal @xmath16 registered at distance @xmath18 , which corresponds to the thickness of the local shower disk , can be extracted .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ t_eqn ] ) , the difference of arrival times of particles originating from a height interval [ @xmath34 follows as    @xmath35    the spread of arrival times of these particles at fixed core distance increases for smaller production heights ( see also fig .",
    "[ rise_distance ] , right plot ) .",
    "accordingly , a larger spread is expected in case of the deep developing photon primaries ( larger @xmath14 ) .",
    "we note that in general , the situation is more complex . the time spread may depend on details of the previous shower development , particularly also on the competition between the signals from the electromagnetic and muonic shower components which will be commented on below .",
    "still , geometrical effects are essential in the relation between time spread and primary composition .    in this study",
    ", we use the risetime @xmath36 of the shower signal reconstructed for 1000  m distance and located along the line given by the projection of the shower axis onto the ground .",
    "first , the risetime @xmath37 of a single station is defined as the time it takes to increase from 10% to 50% of the total signal deposited in that station . according to eq .",
    "( [ dt_eqn ] ) , for non - vertical showers a ( moderate ) dependence of @xmath37 on the internal azimuth angle of the stations within the shower plane is expected .",
    "this is because the height @xmath21 measured along the shower axis is larger for those stations on the exterior side of the shower compared to those on the interior side of the shower . to account for this ,",
    "the observed @xmath37 are corrected depending on the internal azimuth angle @xmath38 of that station : @xmath39\\cdot r_i^2 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath40 depends on distance @xmath20 and primary zenith angle @xmath41 and is parameterised from the data , and @xmath38 is the clockwise angle between the projection of the shower axis on the ground and the line connecting the shower impact point and the station .",
    "it is also expected from eq .",
    "( [ dt_eqn ] ) that the values @xmath42 depend on the distance @xmath18 of the stations .",
    "we obtain the final risetime @xmath36 of the shower by performing a fit to @xmath42 using the function @xmath43 the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 are determined for each event by fitting the station data ( typical values are 50  ns  km@xmath4 and 100  ns  km@xmath3 respectively ) .",
    "the function is anchored at 40  ns at @xmath20=0 as that is the mean single particle response in the water cherenkov detectors .",
    "while geometrical effects connected to the different shower developments from nuclear and photon primaries are a main reason for the risetime difference ( larger @xmath36 in photon showers ) , again this sensitivity to composition is further strengthened by shower mouns which are more abundant in the case of nuclear primaries and can dominate the registered signal at larger zenith angles . as muons tend to arrive within a shorter time window compared to the electromagnetic component which suffers from multiple scattering ,",
    "this further reduces the risetime @xmath36 for nuclear primaries .      as an energy estimator",
    ", the time - integrated energy deposit @xmath46 at 1000  m core distance is used  @xcite . however , for the same initial energy and direction the average @xmath46 from primary photons can be a factor @xmath472 below that from nuclear primaries  @xcite .",
    "reasons are the ( typically factor @xmath124 ) smaller number of muons and , due to the later development , the steeper ground lateral distribution in primary photon showers . for a limit to the fraction of primary photons ,",
    "the energy scales ( transformation from @xmath46 to primary energy ) for both photon and nuclear primaries are required , while the determination of a limit to the flux can rely on the photon energy scale alone .",
    "the energy scale for nuclear primaries is based on the fluorescence technique by using events that are detected with both the surface detector and the fluorescence telescopes  @xcite .",
    "the energy scale for photon primaries ( which induce almost purely electromagnetic cascades ) is taken from simulations .",
    "thus , both approaches are largely independent from assumptions about hadron interactions at high energy .    using a direct relationship between @xmath46 and primary energy for the photon energy scale results in a ( relatively poor ) resolution of about 40% . to improve this , a unique energy conversion for photons",
    "is applied that is described in detail in ref .",
    "it is based on the universality of shower development  @xcite , i.e.  the electromagnetic part of the shower is expected to develop in a well - predictable manner for depths exceeding @xmath14 . in brief , for given values of @xmath46 and @xmath14 , the primary energy is estimated by @xmath48^{-1 }    \\label{ephoton_eqn}\\ ] ] @xmath49 where @xmath46 is measured in units of vertical equivalent muons ( vem )  @xcite , the photon energy @xmath50 is in eev , and @xmath51 is in g  cm@xmath3 . since @xmath14 is not directly measured by the surface detector alone , an iterative approach using eq .",
    "( [ ephoton_eqn ] ) is taken to estimate the energy .",
    "after an initial guess of the photon energy using @xmath46 alone , the typical @xmath14 of the photon showers at this energy is taken from simulations . with this estimate of @xmath14 , a new estimate of the photon energy",
    "is obtained using eq .",
    "( [ ephoton_eqn ] ) , and the procedure is repeated .",
    "the energy estimate is found stable after few iterations and an energy resolution of @xmath1225% is achieved  @xcite .",
    "we use this improved estimation of the photon energy , but note that the main conclusions remain valid also when using a direct energy estimation .",
    "the qed processes of lpm effect  @xcite and geomagnetic cascading ( @xcite and references therein ) need to be considered for photon showers at highest energy . as mentioned before , the lpm effect leads to a suppression of the pair production and bremsstrahlung cross - sections and , thus , additionally increases the separation of photon and nuclear primaries in terms of @xmath14 ( for a review of the lpm effect and experimental observations of the lpm suppression , see  @xcite ) . than nuclear primaries ( differences @xmath53150  g  cm@xmath15 above 10@xmath10  ev ) and a smaller number of muons . ] in case of geomagnetic cascading of uhe photons , the initial conversion of the uhe photon into an electron - positron pair can induce a `` preshower '' ( mostly synchrotron photons plus electron - positron pair(s ) ) outside the atmosphere .",
    "the subsequent air showers from such `` converted '' photons develop higher in the atmosphere ( smaller @xmath14 ) than air showers directly initiated by uhe photons do .",
    "as geomagnetic cascading becomes important at energies above @xmath1250  eev at the southern site of the auger observatory , this process is of minor relevance for the bulk of data used in this analysis .",
    "the shower simulations were generated with the aires simulation package ( v2.8 ) , which includes the lpm effect and geomagnetic cascading  @xcite .",
    "qgsjet  01  @xcite was used as the hadronic interaction model .",
    "the simulation of the water cherenkov detectors uses the geant4  @xcite simulation package along with specific code that handles pmt response and data acquisition electronics .",
    "the result is that the output of a simulated event is in a format that is identical to the data format recorded with the auger observatory .",
    "the shower reconstruction procedure used is the same for real events as it is for simulated events to avoid systematic differences at the reconstruction stage .",
    "in brief , the limit to the photon flux is obtained as follows .",
    "selection cuts are applied to the data ( and simulations ) to ensure events of good reconstruction quality and a high acceptance of the detector to photons .",
    "based on @xmath46 , showers above a minimum primary energy are selected .",
    "this data set is then searched for photon candidates using @xmath36 and @xmath26 ( see section  [ sec_go ] for definitions ) .",
    "simulations assuming photons are used to determine the corresponding selection efficiencies . from the number of photon candidates , the efficiencies with respect to photons , and the experimental exposure ( obtained from the geometrical acceptance known from detector monitoring ) , the upper limit to the photon flux",
    "is derived .",
    "the criteria to select events of good quality are :    * the station with the largest signal is surrounded by 6 active stations ; * @xmath475 stations used in the fitting of the lateral distribution function  @xcite out of which @xmath474 stations have a non - saturated signal of @xmath4710  vem ( vertical equivalent muons )  @xcite ; * reduced @xmath55 ( @xmath27 from eq .",

    "the first cut restricts the analysis to well - contained events , eliminating in particular events near the border of the array .",
    "it affects the geometrical acceptance only .",
    "the multiplicity criterion in the second cut is important also to ensure a good reconstruction of @xmath36 and @xmath26 .",
    "as the multiplicity is related to primary energy , this cut also affects the energy - dependent acceptance of the array to photons .",
