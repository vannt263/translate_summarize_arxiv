    "among the many candidates for new physics are hidden sectors coupled to the standard model through non - renormalizable interactions @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are hidden sector and standard model operators with mass dimensions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 is the energy scale characterizing the new physics , which may range from the weak scale to the planck scale .",
    "hidden sectors that become either weakly coupled or strongly coupled at low energies have several interesting motivations and have been well - studied from various viewpoints .",
    "recently a novel possibility was introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , which suggested that the hidden sector could be conformal at an energy scale @xmath6 .",
    "conformal hidden sectors have bizarre implications , including , for example , kinematic distributions in the production and decay of standard model particles that have no conventional particle interpretation .",
    "this possibility is therefore qualitatively different from other candidates for new physics , and `` unparticles , '' the degrees of freedom of the conformal sector , have recently been the subject of several phenomenological studies  @xcite .",

    "these interactions , such as @xmath9 have implications for a plethora of experiments , and lower bounds on the scales @xmath10 have already been derived by considering a wide range of topics , from anomalous magnetic moments to cp violation to production rates at high energy colliders .    in this paper , we begin by investigating the theoretical framework of unparticles from a general point of view .",
    "we note that the scales @xmath10 appearing in eq .",

    "( [ operators ] ) are typically hierarchically separated , and this hierarchy always counteracts the standard intuition from effective field theory that operators suppressed by more powers of @xmath10 are less important . following the work of refs .",
    "@xcite , we explore minimal unparticle models to provide simple frameworks for phenomenological studies .",
    "this approach clarifies certain issues .",
    "for example , some phenomenological observables become sensitive to arbitrarily high scales @xmath10 ; we show that this sensitivity is artificial , and there is no singularity when bounds are expressed in terms of the fundamental parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "another essential point is that the conformal symmetry does not generically hold to arbitrarily low energies  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the first operator of eq .",
    "( [ operators ] ) breaks conformal invariance at a scale @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "experimental probes of the conformal hidden sector must probe energies in the conformal window @xmath12 .",
    "as we will see , this criterion is very restrictive . in natural models , which we define more precisely below",
    ", it implies that only experiments at energies near the weak scale @xmath13 are viable probes of conformal hidden sectors .",
    "furthermore , requiring a reasonably wide conformal window sets @xmath14 , which implies that all the couplings of the unparticle sector to the standard model are extremely suppressed and there are no accessible experimental signatures .",
    "experimental signatures in a significant conformal window are possible only if the first coupling of eq .",
    "( [ operators ] ) is absent , for reasons we discuss , or is fine - tuned to unnaturally small values .",
    "last , we examine in detail several leading constraints on unparticle physics , considering both scalar unparticles and vector unparticles in turn . given the considerations noted above , we focus on high energy probes , which are most likely to be in the conformal window .",
    "in particular , we consider bounds from @xmath15 colliders in the energy range @xmath16 to @xmath17 , and derive bounds on the scales @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ interactions ] ) and also their implications for the fundamental parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we also find a novel signature of scalar unparticles .",
    "these operators lead to a coupling between the higgs field and gauge bosons , which in turn leads to a modification of the gauge couplings that currently provides a severe constraint and is in the future potentially observable .",
    "we close with a summary of our main results and outline directions for further work .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite , we assume that in the ultraviolet theory , a hidden sector operator @xmath1 with dimension @xmath18 couples to standard model operators @xmath19 with dimension @xmath4 through the coupling @xmath20 the hidden sector becomes conformal at energy @xmath6 , and the operator @xmath1 flows to an operator @xmath7 with dimension @xmath8 . at low energies , then , the couplings of eq .",
    "( [ coupling ] ) flow to @xmath21 the scales @xmath22 determine the strengths of the couplings between the unparticle operator and standard model operators of dimension @xmath4 .",
    "we emphasize that operators of different dimensions couple with different strengths .",
    "for example , standard model fermions couple to vector unparticles through interactions @xmath23 suppressed by @xmath24 .",
    "( note that these operators become almost renormalizable for @xmath8 near 1 . ) on the other hand , standard model gauge bosons couple to scalar unparticles through interactions @xmath25 suppressed by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 labels the gauge group .",
    "standard model fermions may also couple to scalar unparticles through an interaction derived from a 4-point coupling when the higgs boson gets a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath28 after electroweak symmetry breaking : @xmath29 where the last form defines another scale @xmath30 , which is sometimes constrained in phenomenological studies . finally , the higgs couples through the operator @xmath31 this coupling is special in many contexts , as it is the unique super - renormalizable coupling to gauge singlet new physics  @xcite . in the present context",
    ", it also plays an essential role , because once the higgs develops a vev , this operator breaks conformal symmetry in the hidden sector  @xcite .",
    "this breaking occurs at the scale @xmath32      to unify the many scales and couplings discussed above , we may assume a single unparticle operator @xmath1 coupling to the standard model .",

    "[ sec : scales ] .",
    "the many parameters @xmath35 enter into interaction terms .",
    "however , as we will see below , very few enter any given process , and for the purposes of setting bounds consistent with conventions in the literature  @xcite , we may simply set @xmath36 .    neglecting the @xmath37 ,",
    "the minimal model is defined by the discrete parameter @xmath34 , two fundamental scales @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and three continuous parameters , @xmath18 , @xmath8 , and @xmath38 .",
    "these fundamental parameters completely determine the couplings of unparticles to the standard model , and provide a complete , yet simple , framework for studying the phenomenology and cosmology of unparticles and hidden conformal sectors .",
    "it is convenient to define dimensionless ratios @xmath39 all remaining mass scales of the minimal model are , then , related to the mass scale @xmath6 through @xmath40 where we have written all expressions with positive exponents , assuming @xmath41 .    from these expressions , we see that @xmath42 .",
    "this hierarchy ( partially ) offsets the standard intuition of effective field theories that operators suppressed by more powers of the characteristic energy scale are less promising to probe .",
    "for example , @xmath43 implies that gauge couplings probed by , for example , gluon - gluon collisions at hadron colliders , may yield more promising signals than couplings to fermions .",
    "note that we have assumed @xmath44 , that is , that the theory enters the conformal regime below the scale where it is coupled to the standard model .",
    "this is required for theoretical consistency .",
    "if @xmath45 , then the theory is already conformal at the scale @xmath5 , and so the effective couplings @xmath22 should be replaced simply by @xmath5 .",
    "this is equivalent to taking @xmath46 in all the formulae , and so we may take @xmath47 without loss of generality .      as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the breaking of conformal invariance at energy scale @xmath11 means that unparticle physics is relevant only for experiments that probe energies @xmath48 . from eq .",
    "( [ lambdanot ] ) , we see that creating a conformal window spanning , say , one order of magnitude requires @xmath49 this is a significant constraint , given @xmath50 .    one way to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ criterion ] ) is to take large @xmath51 , that is , @xmath52 .",
    "this raises the energy scale of all unparticle interactions and rapidly decouples unparticles from accessible experiments . for unparticles to be accessible through weak - scale experiments",
    ", one must take @xmath53 .",
    "( note that precision experiments , for example , those probing flavor , cp , and baryon number violation , probe scales far above the weak scale ; however , these are typically conducted at very low energies outside the conformal window . )",
    "a second option is small @xmath54 , that is , @xmath55 . as evident from eqs .",
    "( [ lambda3 ] ) , ( [ lambda4 ] ) , and ( [ lambda3prime ] ) , this raises @xmath24 , @xmath26 , and @xmath30 rapidly , again making unparticle physics inaccessible .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scales10 ] , where we have plotted all relevant energy scales as functions of @xmath8 for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 . even for this relatively small hierarchy between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which creates only a slight conformal window , we find @xmath59 , which is likely beyond the reach of foreseeable experiments .",
    "the third and final logical possibility is @xmath60 .",
    "naturalness suggests @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , similar to quadratic divergences in the higgs boson mass , quantum corrections to @xmath38 have a power law divergence , which scales as @xmath62 .",
    "thus even if one sets @xmath63 at tree level , it becomes of order @xmath64 at loop - level .",
    "of course , if there are no scalar unparticle operators @xmath7 with dimension @xmath65 , then @xmath66 . consideration of scalar operators with @xmath67 requires extending the standard range @xmath50 through the singularities at @xmath68 .",
    "alternatively , one may simply consider vector unparticles without scalar unparticles .",
    "these cases provide natural mechanisms to suppress @xmath38 , and would imply that the conformal window extends down to very low energies .",
    "for whatever reason , either assuming fine - tuning or one of the more natural possibilities noted above , one may consider @xmath60 .",
    "we can then take @xmath69 , implying @xmath70 . this possibility is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scales2 ] , where we have taken @xmath71 . for @xmath72 , the conformal window may extend down to @xmath73 .",

    "scalar unparticles can also be seen in modifications to cross - sections at high energy colliders .",
    "consider an unparticle operator @xmath7 that couples both to higgs bosons ( as in @xcite ) and to gauge fields @xmath79 below the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking , the first of these interactions turns into a tadpole for @xmath7 , which leads to the breaking of the conformal invariance at the scale @xmath11  @xcite .",

    "alternatively , one could obtain the same result by integrating out @xmath7 at the threshold @xmath82 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a threshold correction to the gauge coupling @xmath83 thus it is possible to probe scales of the unparticle physics by comparing values of the gauge coupling above and below @xmath11 .    from the phenomenological perspective ,",
    "one is most interested in the case where the conformal invariance of the unparticle sector is only broken below the electroweak scale , @xmath84 .",
    "existing measurements of the fine structure constant at zero energy and at the @xmath85 pole are consistent with the standard model renormalization group evolution within experimental and theoretical uncertainties . in this comparison ,",
    "the largest uncertainty arises from the value of the coupling at the @xmath85 pole  @xcite @xmath86 comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : couplingmod ] ) and ( [ eq : alphamz ] ) we find that the scales of unparticle physics must be quite large .",
    "for example , taking @xmath87 we find @xmath88    written in this form , constraints on the fundamental scales of the unparticle sector implicitly depend on several parameters : @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "thus , it is useful to rephrase this result in terms of the required fine - tuning of @xmath38 . choosing values of the remaining parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : scales10 ] allows for @xmath38 of the order of a one - loop contribution , but as a result , @xmath91 . if we choose the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : scales2 ] , we find @xmath92 , which is significantly smaller that its natural one loop value . as a final example , consider the situation where all scales in the unparticle sector are comparable . in this case",
    ", @xmath93 is required , again a significant fine - tuning .",
    "scalar unparticles may also be probed more directly by looking at their effects on high energy processes . to analyze these effects ,",
    "we conservatively consider only gauge - invariant operators that are also @xmath94- , @xmath95- , and flavor - conserving . in general , one could also consider operators that violate one or more of these global symmetries  these will be much more stringently constrained .    for scalar unparticles , at leading order in @xmath10 there are two types of interactions with standard model fermions : @xmath96 where we have inserted the electromagnetic coupling @xmath97 for future convenience .",
    "when electroweak symmetry is broken , the first term generates @xmath98 couplings proportional to @xmath78 . for the second term , integrating by parts , the vector contribution vanishes and the axial vector contribution is proportional to @xmath99 . since @xmath100 for all but the top quark , we expect the first class of operators to dominate and focus on those operators here .",
    "the scalar unparticle feynman rules are @xmath101 where  @xcite @xmath102",
