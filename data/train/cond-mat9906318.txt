    "the thermodynamic properties of many quantum systems have been studied within the path integral formulation of statistical mechanics .",
    "@xcite an essential aspect of this formulation is the mapping of the quantum system onto a classical model , whose equilibrium properties can be derived by classical molecular dynamics or monte carlo simulation techniques with arbitrarily accuracy .",
    "however , the efficient calculation of equilibrium dynamical properties of quantum many - body systems by this formulation , i.e. , time dependent correlation functions , still remains as a challenging unsolved problem .",
    "@xcite    several applications of the path integral formulation have been developed around a quantity introduced by feynman and hibbs : @xcite , the _ effective classical potential _ ( ecp ) .",
    "this concept allows the formulation of a variational principle for quantum systems in thermodynamic equilibrium , whose importance can be appreciated by quoting the conclusions of the feynman and hibbs book : `` [ this variational principle is ] the only example of a result obtained with path integrals which can not be obtained in simple manner by more conventional methods '' . @xcite the original formulation of this principle used a free particle as a reference system , a fact that limits the range of validity of this approximation to temperatures where the system behaves nearly in a classical way .",
    "an essential improvement of this variational theory was formulated by giachetti and tognetti @xcite , and , independently , by feynman and kleinert @xcite , using a harmonic oscillator as reference system . with this improvement",
    "the equilibrium properties of quantum anharmonic systems can be realistically approximated even in the low temperature limit .",
    "@xcite the name `` pure quantum self - consistent harmonic approximation '' has been recently coined for the application of the variational principle at this level of approximation .",
    "@xcite    further applications of the ecp concept are related to kinetic and dynamical properties of quantum systems in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "gillan formulated the basis of the _ quantum transition state theory _ ( qtst ) , a kinetic approximation to calculate rate constants of thermal activated processes , that may be applied to anharmonic many - body systems at temperatures where quantum effects are important .",
    "@xcite this approximation has been used in condensed matter and chemical physics investigations , e.g. in recent studies of reorientation rates of hydrogen around a boron atom in doped silicon , @xcite , or proton transfer reactions @xcite .",
    "the most important quantity in qtst is the so called _ centroid density _ , a function that carries exactly the same information as the ecp : the centroid density is an exponential function of the ecp .",
    "an interesting dynamical approximation , called _ centroid molecular dynamics _ ( cmd ) , was formulated by cao and voth @xcite to calculate real time correlation functions of quantum particles at finite temperatures .",
    "the ecp is an essential quantity for this approximation as the dynamical properties are derived from trajectories generated by classical equations of motion of particles moving in the ecp .",
    "a justification of the cmd approach has been given by showing that the centroid position correlation function agrees to second order , in a taylor expansion in time , with the kubo transformed position correlation function .",
    "@xcite the latter correlation function is related to the dynamical response of the system to an external force .",
    "unfortunately , the limits and capability of cmd for many - body systems at temperatures where quantum effects and anharmonicity are relevant have not been at present fully established . for recent applications of this dynamical approach see refs . @xcite and @xcite .    the centroid density or , equivalently , the ecp , are then important concepts in the theory of path integrals . the motivation of the present work is based on a simple idea : if the centroid density is the basis of several interesting physical applications within the path integral formulation ( i.e. , a variational principle , and the qtst and cmd approximations ) , then the definition of this quantity within the schrdinger formulation may lead to new physical insight into these approximations .",
    "our goal is to present the correspondence between path integral concepts , such as the centroid density or the ecp , and the schrdinger formulation . in a recent contribution @xcite",
    "we have analyzed the centroid density showing that is related to the quasi - static response of the quantum system to a constant external force .",
    "some physical implications of this analysis have been explored in the zero temperature limit , e.g. , the ecp corresponds to the mean energy of _ minimum energy wave packets _",
