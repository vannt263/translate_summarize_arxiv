    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.max_thetac ] for a lens with @xmath74 = 2 , 0 , -2 and a dark lens .",
    "the fsfl only shows small difference to that of psfl and pspl . the difference is less than 10 @xmath11as for the case of galactic bulge , and even smaller than 1 @xmath11as for the more distant source in the smc and m31",
    "this is because the fl effect is important only when the lens is extremely close to the observer or the source and the major difference between fsfl and pspl or psfl comes from the finiteness of the source .",
    "since @xmath28 is larger than @xmath41 for most of the time , the fs effect only slightly changes the astrometric trajectory .",
    "even when the lens is extremely close to the source ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.max_thetac ] ) , the already reduced @xmath1 makes the difference so small that it is hardly observable .    in order to test",
    "if the astrometric signal is observable towards smc , we simulate the astrometric trajectory of macho-97-smc-1 @xcite .",
    "this event has baseline magnitude _ v _",
    "= 17.7 , so it will take _ sim _",
    "@xmath93 3 hours to reach 30-@xmath11as accuracy @xcite .",
    "we thus simulate observations by _ sim _ assuming the measurement errors to be gaussian distribution with @xmath94 = 30 @xmath11as .",
    "we put the lens at a distance of 15 kpc and 64 kpc corresponding to the halo and self - lensing scenario towards smc .",
    "we then assign a putative finite size of 1 , 5 , and 10 @xmath92 to the lens and the source .",
    "the mass of the lens is set to be 1 @xmath10 . from fig .",
    "[ fig.smc ] we can see that if the lens is in the galactic halo , we are able to detect the astrometric signal because of the very large @xmath1 .",
    "however , the finite size of the source and the lens is not revealed in such a close lens . on the other hand ,",
    "the fs and fl effects are prominent in the self - lensing regime due to the small @xmath1 .",
    "but the astrometric trajectory is too small to be constrained by current instruments , not to mention to disentangle between the pspl and fspl or psfl .",
    "nevertheless , it is still possible to use the ( non-)detection of the astrometric ellipse to infer if the lens is in the galactic halo or it is a self - lensing event towards smc .",
    "we also considered the possibility to detect the astrometric trajectory from ground - based instruments such as _ prima _ for vlti .",
    "_ prima _ can determine the astrometry to 10-@xmath11as level in 30 minutes provided a reference star within 10 arcsec and a 200-m baseline ( ats mode ) .",
    "the goal of _ prima _ is to perform astrometric measurement for a target as faint as 18 ( 15 ) mag with uts ( ats ) provided a 13 ( 10 ) mag reference star in _",
    "k _ band @xcite . there is a bright star ( _ k _ = 10.28 ) in the vicinity of macho-97-smc-1 ( separated at 30.4 arcsec ) , so theoretically it would be possible to obtain 30-@xmath11as accuracy in astrometric measurements within one hour with the uts ( 130 m baseline ) .",
    "however , for the two stars separated by 20 arcsec , there is already 90% reduction in the interferometric fringe visibility .",
    "thus it would be very challenging to conduct such measurement .",
    "it would be very difficult to routinely measure the astrometry towards smc / lmc with _ prima _ because most of the single lens events in the magellanic clouds ( 14 out of 15 , except macho-97-smc-1 ) have sources fainter than 19 mag in _ v _ ( 1 in @xcite ; 12 in @xcite ; 1 in , which is the same as @xcite , and 2 in @xcite ) .    to perform astrometric measurements for microlensing events towards m31",
    "is beyond the limit of both _ prima _ and _ sim _ since the sources in m31 are too faint ( see e.g. riffeser et .",
    "al . , in preparation , and reference therein ) .",
    "we have studied the astrometric aspects of microlensing by simultaneously including the fs and fl effects .",
    "our results show that the astrometric signal is underestimated or overestimated by assuming pl or ps , respectively .",
    "while the fs effect is prominent when the lens transits the surface of the source , the fl effect is revealed when the lens is very close to the source , which would be in the self - lensing regime . in the context of the self - lensing scenario , where a background star is lensed by a foreground star , the light contribution from the lens is in general not negligible .",
    "we thus consider the luminous - lens scenario , which attenuates the signal of the centroidal displacement .",
    "astrometric trajectories with a source located in the galactic bulge , smc , and m31 are discussed , which show that @xmath1 of halo - lensing events is at least one order of magnitude larger than that of self - lensing in smc and m31 .",
    "our results also indicate that the finiteness of the lens is more likely to be revealed in the self - lensing scenario towards distant source located in magellanic clouds or m31 , although it is very difficult to distinguish between pl and fl with current instruments .",
