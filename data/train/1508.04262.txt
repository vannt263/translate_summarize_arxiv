    "the classical chip - firing model describes the dynamics of a laplacian action on a graph and can be seen as a discrete diffusion process , see e.g.  @xcite . for a graph with @xmath0 vertices , configurations are integer vectors @xmath1 where @xmath2 is interpreted as the number of chips at vertex @xmath3 . at each time step ,",
    "chips are redistributed via local rules . for a configuration @xmath4 , if a vertex @xmath3 has at least as many chips as it has neighbors , @xmath3 fires sending one chip to each of its neighbors , forming the new configuration @xmath5 .",
    "this action is easily identified as subtracting the appropriate row of the graph laplacian : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the graph laplacian and @xmath8 is the @xmath3th indicator vector .",
    "this model is well studied and has a strong theory of long term behavior in terms of self - organized criticality  @xcite , superstability  @xcite and energy minimization  @xcite . in particular",
    ", every initial configuration eventually stabilizes to a unique stable configuration - the order of firings does not matter .",
    "already in  @xcite , gabrielov broadened the setting for chip - firing realizing that one could consider a finite set of states and the dynamics governed by any _",
    "avalanche finite _ matrix .",
    "the system did not need to come from an underlying graph ; the firing rule is governed by the matrix .",
    "such systems similarly converge to a set of stable configurations regardless of the order of firings .",
    "in more recent work , the present authors  @xcite recognized avalanche - finite matrices as precisely _",
    "@xmath9-matrices _ , a well known class of matrices from other contexts and continued to expand the theory of chip - firing in this setting .",
    "in particular , the theory of criticality , superstability and energy minimization extends to all @xmath9-matrices .",
    "the name _ avalanche finite _ , however , is quite appropriate .",
    "if one attempts to chip - fire using a matrix outside of this class , gabrielov showed that not all initial configurations will eventually stabilize .",
    "some state will always be able to fire .    in this paper we propose a significant broadening of the chip - firing model allowing for the redistribution dynamics to be governed by _ any invertible integer matrix _ while maintaining the long term critical , superstable , and energy minimizing behavior of the classical model . to overcome the seeming contradiction with gabrielov s work",
    ", we change the scope of _ valid _ configurations over which chip - firing occurs . in classical chip - firing ,",
    "valid configurations are precisely non - negative integer vectors , i.e. integer points in the closure of the positive orthant . in our more general setting ,",
    "the positive orthant is replaced by a different cone . as a consequence ,",
    "valid ( and hence also critical and superstable ) configurations may contain negative entries .",
    "the general set - up is as follows . for a fixed invertible matrix @xmath7 , one must choose an @xmath9-matrix @xmath9 .",
    "the chip - firing model will be dictated by the pair @xmath10 .",
    "the matrix @xmath9 can be any @xmath9-matrix , it need not depend on @xmath7 . hence for a fixed distribution matrix @xmath7 , one can in fact define many chip - firing models .",
    "the valid configurations are a collection of integer points , denoted @xmath11 , determined by the matrix @xmath12 . given a configuration @xmath13 , a site @xmath3 is allowed to fire if the resulting configuration @xmath14 remains in @xmath11 .",
    "the well - behaved dynamics of this model are established by relating chip - firing via @xmath7 over @xmath11 to chip - firing via @xmath9 over a related set of ( not necessarily integer ) configurations . as in the graphical case , critical , superstable and energy minimizing configurations of @xmath11 all form systems of representatives of the _ critical group _ of @xmath7 , @xmath15 .    as a special case ,",
    "one easily recovers classical chip - firing on a graph .",
    "let @xmath7 be ( the transpose of ) a reduced graph laplacian .",
    "then @xmath7 is itself an @xmath9-matrix .",
    "thus for such an @xmath7 ( or for any initial @xmath9-matrix ) one can choose @xmath16 giving the pairing @xmath17 . as we will see in section  [ graphs ]",
    ", @xmath11 then reduces to @xmath18 and we recover the well known chip - firing model for graphs and digraphs .    as another special case",
    ", one can always set @xmath19 , since the identity matrix is an @xmath9-matrix .",
    "the pairing @xmath20 is particularly interesting .",
    "the superstable configurations for @xmath21 are precisely the integer points of the fundamental parallelepiped of the lattice generated by @xmath7 , see section  [ lattice ] .",
    "it is well - known that these integer points form a system of representatives for coker@xmath22 .",
    "the theory here now gives a dynamical system which achieves these configurations .    in section  [ sec : general ]",
    ", we explain the general set - up for chip - firing over an invertible integer matrix @xmath7 with respect to a choice of @xmath9-matrix @xmath9 . in sections",
    "[ sec : critical ] , [ sec : energy ] , and [ sec : superstable ] we show the existence and uniqueness of critical , energy minimizing , and superstable configurations respectively .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : cases ] we consider how the long term dynamics vary under different choices of @xmath9 including @xmath16 and @xmath23 .",
    "we also consider the special case of chip - firing in higher dimensions where @xmath7 is a reduced combinatorial laplacian of a simplicial complex as in  @xcite .",

    "now let @xmath9 be an @xmath24 m - matrix with real entries and define @xmath27 .",
    "the matrix @xmath28 will dictate which configurations are _ valid _ configurations of the system .",
    "in particular , given @xmath29 define the set :    @xmath30    @xmath11 consists of all integer vectors formed by multiplying @xmath28 by a non - negative real vector . note that without the non - negativity condition on @xmath31 , this set would simply be all of @xmath32 since @xmath28 is invertible .",
    "the set of integer points in @xmath11 are the valid configurations for the pairing @xmath10 , under the dynamics of @xmath7 . in classical chip - firing on a graph",
    ", @xmath11 is exactly the non - negative integer points .    for a valid configuration @xmath33 ,",
    "a site @xmath3 is ready to fire if the configuration @xmath34 , resulting from subtracting the @xmath3th row of @xmath7 , is also valid , i.e. if @xmath35 remains in @xmath36 .",
    "a configuration is called _ stable _ if no site is ready to fire .",
    "similarly , a set of sites can multifire ( with multiplicity ) if the resulting configuration @xmath37 is also valid , i.e. if @xmath38 remains in @xmath11 , where @xmath39 is the number of times site @xmath3 fires . a configuration in which no set of sites can multifire",

    "we assume that @xmath19 for simplicity .",
    "suppose that @xmath19 , then @xmath199 given an invertible matrix @xmath7 , define the _ lattice _",
    "generated by the columns of @xmath7 : @xmath200 the _ fundamental parallelepiped _ of @xmath201 with respect to @xmath7 is : @xmath202 it is well known that the integer points of the fundamental parallelepiped of a full - rank lattice form a system of representatives for @xmath203 , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 9 ) .",
    "the next proposition shows that these points can be seen as stable configurations in a chip - firing model .",
    "let @xmath72 be a superstable configuration and let @xmath205 .",
    "then @xmath31 is a superstable configuration in @xmath54 .",
    "hence @xmath51 .",
    "suppose @xmath206 for some @xmath3",
    ". then , @xmath207 , contradicting the superstability of @xmath31 .",
    "therefore every superstable configuration @xmath79 is contained in @xmath204 .",
    "furthermore , the number of superstable configurations is the same as the number of integer points in @xmath204 since both form a system of representatives for @xmath203 .",
    "hence the two collections must be the same .",
    "the argument above actually shows that any stable point of @xmath11 must be contained in @xmath204 . as critical configurations",
    "are also stable and a system of representatives for @xmath203 , they indeed must coincide with the superstables .",
    "[ ex : i ] let @xmath7 be as in example  [ ex : running ] and let @xmath19",
    ". then the superstable and critical configurations are : @xmath93 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\1 \\end{pmatrix * } , \\begin{pmatrix*}[r ] 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix * } , \\begin{pmatrix*}[r ] 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix * } , \\begin{pmatrix*}[r ] 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix*}.\\ ] ]      the classical framework for chip - firing is on a graphical network with distribution given by the graph laplacian as discussed in section  [ graphs ] . in  @xcite",
    ", a model for chip - firing in higher dimensions was introduced .",
    "the underlying configuration of the system is a simplicial complex and the commodities ( chips , flow ) are associated to ridges ( codimension - one faces ) of the complex .",
    "the distribution dynamics are given by a reduced combinatorial laplacian relating codimension - one faces to maximal faces .",
    "the algebraic aspects of chip - firing , i.e. the form and size of the critical group were worked out in  @xcite , including the connection to higher dimensional spanning trees of the complex .",
    "it remained an open problem to give a notion of critical or superstable configurations in this context , namely sets of representative for the critical group that reflect long - term stability dynamics of the system .",
    "the paradigm introduced here provides well motivated collections of critical and superstable configurations .",
    "we illustrate with an example and refer the reader to  @xcite for a more thorough discussion of chip - firing in higher dimensions .",
    "[ ex : tetra ] let @xmath208 be the two - dimensional boundary complex of the tetrahedron with maximal faces : @xmath209 .",
    "faces of the complex will be oriented , we will use the standard orientation induced by the vertices . in our example , this directs the edges from smaller vertex to larger vertex .",
    "the two - dimensional faces are also oriented from smaller to larger vertices .",
    "envision traversing the triangular face @xmath210 by starting at vertex @xmath211 moving to vertex @xmath159 then vertex @xmath212 and returning back to vertex @xmath211 . traversing the face in this way , we consider the edges @xmath213 and @xmath214 oriented in the same direction with respect to @xmath210 and oriented oppositely to the edge @xmath215 with respect to @xmath210 .",
    "the consistency of orientation of two edges contained in a common triangle will be reflected by a @xmath216 or @xmath217 in the combinatorial laplacian .      as shown in  @xcite , the sink in this context",
    "consists of an entire spanning tree of the one - dimensional skeleton of @xmath208 .",
    "choose the sink to be the one - dimensional tree @xmath218 with edges @xmath219 . with this choice",
    ", there will be three states in the system corresponding to the three edges not in the tree : @xmath220 .",
    "the reduced combinatorial laplacian is formed by deleting the rows and columns corresponding to the edges in the spanning tree . in this case , the reduced combinatorial laplacian @xmath7 of @xmath208 with respect to @xmath218 is the matrix from example  [ ex : running ] , our running example : @xmath221    configurations in @xmath11 are elements of @xmath222 which associate an integer value to edges . in this context , it is natural to consider these values as flows along the edges ( as opposed to numbers of chips ) .",
    "firing an edge consists of subtracting the appropriate row of the combinatorial laplacian .",
    "this can be interpreted as diverting flow from an edge across triangles that contain it .",
    "computing critical and superstable configurations requires a choice of @xmath9 .",
    ". then we find the configurations of example  [ ex : i ] : @xmath93 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\1 \\end{pmatrix * } , \\begin{pmatrix*}[r ] 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix * } , \\begin{pmatrix*}[r ] 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix * } , \\begin{pmatrix*}[r ] 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix*}.\\ ] ] figure  [ fig:2dcriticals ] illustrates the three non - zero critical configurations .",
    "the third image interprets the negative value in the critical configuration not as a negative flow but as flow in the opposite direction of the orientation of the edge .",
    "one narrative for this system is as a model of traffic flow .",
    "the edges represent streets and the vertices are intersections .",
    "sink edges represent major boulevards that can handle large amounts of traffic .",
    "as local streets become congested , traffic diverts to neighboring streets .",
    "informally , the system stabilizes when as much traffic as possible has been diverted to the major boulevards .",
    "the third image of figure  [ fig:2dcriticals ] is a solution in which the directionality of street @xmath214 has been reversed .",
    "we have seen that if @xmath7 is an @xmath9-matrix , then @xmath16 is a natural choice that yields the classical model with non - negative valid configurations .",
    "we have also seen that we can always set @xmath19 and achieve the integer points of the fundamental parallelepiped .",
    "what are natural choices if @xmath7 is the reduced combinatorial laplacian of a simplicial complex , as in example  [ ex : tetra ] ?",
    "the matrix @xmath9 from example  [ ex : running ] is the reduced graph laplacian of the facet - to - facet dual graph of @xmath208 .",
    "but , in general , this dual graph will not have the correct size to match @xmath7 .",
