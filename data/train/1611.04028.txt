    "dielectric materials ( dielectrics for brevity ) play a fundamental role in the accumulation and dissipation of electric and magnetic energy .",
    "their molecular structure and properties have been widely analyzed since the early faraday s works , especially for insulation in electrical and electronic circuits .",
    "polarization by electric fields is typically used to store a large amount of energy and , to this aim , the polar dielectrics are preferred in many applications . however , modelling the behaviour and response of dielectric materials is important for various reasons .",
    "namely , prediction of standard and anomalous phenomena is possible only by model analysis and model - based simulation .",
    "moreover , in many applications , the models allow to evaluate performance indexes and to adjust the structure or parameters of dielectrics so that responses obey design specifications , reference behaviours , etc .",
    "the main dielectric parameter affecting the models is the permittivity @xmath0 or the associated susceptibility @xmath1 , which is in fact depending on the frequency of the applied electric field .",
    "also the time - domain descriptions expressed by the relaxation and response functions are relevant especially to perform simulations .",
    "the standard and simplest model in the physics of dielectrics was provided by debye in 1912 @xcite based on a relaxation function decaying exponentially in time with a characteristic relaxation time .",
    "however , simple exponential models are often not satisfactory , while advanced non - exponential models ( usually referred as `` anomalous relaxation '' ) are commonly required to better explain experimental observations of complex systems .",
    "namely , the relaxation response of many dielectric materials can not be explained by the standard debye process and different models have been successively introduced .",
    "anomalous relaxation and diffusion processes are nowadays recognized in many complex or disordered systems that possess variable structures and parameters and show a time evolution different from the standard exponential pattern @xcite .",
    "biological tissues are an interesting example of complex systems with anomalous relaxation and diffusion processes @xcite and they can be considered as dielectrics with losses .    since the pioneering work of kohlrausch in 1854 @xcite , introducing a stretched exponential relaxation successively rediscovered by williams and watts @xcite , important models where introduced by cole and cole @xcite , davidson and cole @xcite , havriliak and negami @xcite and others .",
    "the challenges are measuring or extrapolating the dielectric properties at high frequencies , fitting the experimental data from various tissues and from different samples of the same tissue , and representing the complex , nonlinear frequency - dependence of the permittivity @xcite .",
    "cole - cole relaxation models , for instance , are frequently used to model propagation in dispersive biological tissues ( cole - cole media ) because they represent the frequency - dependent relative permittivity better than classical debye models and over a wide frequency range @xcite .",
    "more generally , the universal relaxation response specified by a fractional power - law is used for electromagnetic fields propagation @xcite .    nowadays the aforementioned models , named after their proposers , are considered as the `` classical '' models for dielectrics but some other interesting models have been more recently introduced by jurlewicz , weron and stanislavsky @xcite and hilfer @xcite to better fit the experimental data in complex systems .    in the present paper",
    ", we try to survey the most common models existing in the literature to our best knowledge and describe their main properties under a mathematical point of view .",
    "all the models have the common feature that for large times the relaxation and response functions generally decay with a power law that indeed is found in most experiments .",
    "this power law behaviour allows to derive the equations governing the evolution of the dielectric processes by using non - local operators provided by the so - called fractional calculus , that are pseudo - differential operators interpretable as suitable integrals and derivative of non - integer order @xcite .",
    "then certain high transcendental functions related to fractional calculus arise naturally in the description of the relaxation and response functions , mostly of the mittag - leffler type .",
    "there is however a further feature which ties all these models and which we would like to highlight in this survey : relaxation and response are completely monotonic functions of time , which means that they are expressed as a continuous distributions of simple exponential functions with a non - negative spectrum of relaxation times . to our knowledge",
    ", the property of complete monotonicity has not been sufficiently outlined in the existing literature at variance with the power law asymptotic behaviour .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in section [ s :",
    "preliminary ] we provide a preliminary introduction to physical and mathematical aspects of dielectric relaxation by illustrating the main functions we will use to describe each model . in section [ s : mainmodels ] , which constitutes the main part of this paper , we proceed to describe the principal dielectric models and , for each model , we present the characteristic functions ( with their graphical representations ) and study the associated evolution equations .",
    "three appendixes complete the paper : the first one presents some results on mittag - leffler and related functions used to describe the characteristic functions of each model ; the second appendix summarizes the main integral and derivative operators used in the analysis of the evolution equations ; finally , few biographical notes are dedicated to the main authors who contributed to the introduction of the models considered in the paper .",
    "under the influence of the electric field , an electric polarization occurs to the matter . the electric displacement effect on free and bound charges",
    "is described by the displacement field @xmath2 which is related to the electric field @xmath3 and to the polarization @xmath4 by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the permittivity of the free space . for a perfect isotropic dielectric and for harmonic fields of frequency @xmath7 , the interdependence between @xmath3 and @xmath4 is described by a constitutive law @xmath8 \\mathbf{e } = \\varepsilon_0 [ ( \\varepsilon_s - \\varepsilon_\\infty)\\hat{\\chi}(\\iu \\omega ) ] \\mathbf{e } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the static and infinite dielectric constants . the normalized complex",
    "_ permittivity _ @xmath11 and",
    "the normalized complex _ susceptibility _ @xmath12 are specific characteristics of the polarized medium and are usually determined by matching experimental data with an appropriate theoretical model .    from the physical point of view",
    ", the description of dielectrics , considered as passive and causal linear systems , is carried out also in time by considering two causal functions of time ( i.e. , vanishing for @xmath13 ) :    * the _ relaxation function _",
    "@xmath14 , * the _ response function _ @xmath15 .",
    "the relaxation function describes the decay of polarization whereas the response function its decay rate ( the depolarization current ) .",
    "note that our notation @xmath16 for the relaxation and response functions is in conflict with a notation frequently used in the literature , where the relaxation function is denoted by @xmath15 and the response function by @xmath17 .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "the relationship between response and relaxation functions can be better clarified by their probabilistic interpretation investigated in several papers by karina weron and her team ( e.g. , see @xcite ) : interpreting the _ relaxation function _ as a _ survival probability _ @xmath14 , the _ response function _ turns out to be the _ probability density function _ corresponding to the _ cumulative probability function _ @xmath18 .",
    "thus the two functions are interrelated as follows @xmath19 and @xmath20    in view of their probabilistic meaning , @xmath15 and @xmath14 are both non - negative and non - increasing functions . in particular , we get the limit @xmath21 whereas @xmath22 may be finite or infinite .",
    "the response function @xmath15 is obtained as the inverse laplace transform of the normalized complex susceptibility by setting the laplace parameter @xmath23 , that is @xmath24 where we have used the superscript @xmath25 to denote a laplace transform , i.e. @xmath26 ; then , for the relaxation function @xmath14 we have @xmath27    we can thus outline the basic laplace transforms pairs as follows @xmath28 where we have adopted the notation @xmath29 to denote the juxtaposition of a function of time @xmath30 with its laplace transform @xmath31 .",
    "the standard model in the physics of dielectrics was provided by debye @xcite according to which the normalized complex susceptibility , depending on the frequency of the external field , is provided , unless a proper multiplicative constant , as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the only expected relaxation time . in this case , both relaxation and response functions turn out to be purely exponential .",
    "in fact , recalling standard results in laplace transforms , we get @xmath34    even though the debye relaxation model was the first derived on the basis of statistical mechanics , it finds a little application in complex systems where it is more reasonable to have a discrete or a continuous distribution of debye models with different relaxation times , so that the complex susceptibility reads @xmath35 with @xmath36 non - negative constants or , more generally , @xmath37 with @xmath38 . in mathematical language the above properties are achieved requiring relaxation and response to be locally integrable and completely monotone ( licm ) functions @xcite .",
    "the local integrability is requested to be laplace transformable in the classical sense .",
    "the complete monotonicity means that the functions are non - negative with infinitely many derivatives for @xmath39 alternating in sign ; we provide here its formal definition .",
    "a function @xmath40 is said completely monotonic ( cm ) on @xmath41 if @xmath42 has derivatives of all orders and @xmath43 for any @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the above definition can be extended to @xmath46 when the limits of @xmath47 as @xmath48 are finite .    as discussed by hanyga",
    "@xcite , cm is essential to ensure the monotone decay of the energy in isolated systems ( as it appears reasonable from physical considerations ) ; thus , restricting to cm functions is essential for the physical acceptability and realizability of the dielectric models ( see @xcite ) .    for the basic bernstein theorem for licm functions @xcite , @xmath14 and @xmath49",
    "are represented as real laplace transforms of non - negative spectral functions ( of frequency ) @xmath50    due to the interrelation between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the corresponding spectral functions are obviously related and indeed @xmath51    as a matter of fact , the laplace transform @xmath52 of @xmath14 and @xmath53 of @xmath15 turn to be iterated laplace transforms ( that are , stieltjes transforms ) of the corresponding frequency spectral functions @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "in fact , by exchanging order in the laplace integrals , we get @xmath56    as a consequence , the frequency spectral functions can be derived from @xmath57 and @xmath58 as their inverse stieltjes transforms thanks to the titchmarsh inversion formula @xcite , @xmath59\\ , , \\ ;      k^{\\phi}(r ) = \\mp \\frac{1}{\\pi }          { \\rm i m } \\left [ \\widetilde{\\phi}(s ) \\bigl|_{s = re^{\\pm \\iu \\pi } } \\right ] \\,.\\ ] ]    for a physical viewpoint , it may be more interesting to deal with spectral functions expressed in terms of relaxation times @xmath60 rather than frequencies @xmath61 .",
    "then we write @xmath62 so that the time spectral functions are obtained from the corresponding frequency spectral ones by the variable change @xmath63 ( we also refer to @xcite for a method based on the generalized multiplication efros theorem to derive spectral functions )",
    ".    we have to keep in mind that , even though we have distributions of multiple debye relaxation processes characterized by time exponentials of negative argument , the characteristic functions can decay for small and large times as power laws with negative exponents due to certain asymptotic behaviours of the corresponding frequency or time spectral functions . in these cases the dielectric relaxation",
    "is told to be _",
    "this power - law behaviour is usually found , for instance , in complex bodies so that suitable models of anomalous relaxation have been introduced in the literature to properly account for experimental data .",
    "we close this section with a few further considerations on spectral functions used to characterize the processes of anomalous dielectric relaxation .    at first",
    ", we note that in eq .",
    "( [ rho - tau ] ) we have @xmath64 indeed , from ( [ eq : response ] ) and ( [ eq : h_psi_phi ] ) we get @xmath65 and ( [ h - rho - tau ] ) follows after setting @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ rho - tau ] ) .    finally , we consider the logarithmic spectral function of relaxation times based on the scaling @xmath67 running from @xmath68 to @xmath69 for both the functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 . setting in eq .",
    "( [ k - psi - phi ] ) @xmath70 we get @xmath71 and similarly for @xmath72 .",
    "thus we may introduce the required logarithmic spectral functions , that we denote by @xmath73 , which are related to frequency spectral functions @xmath74 by @xmath75 and , consequently , the time relaxation spectral functions @xmath76 by @xmath77    these spectral functions are mostly used in experiments because they cover several decades of relaxation times accounting in an equal measure for the smaller and the larger times .",
    "the debye model @xcite is one of the first models introduced to describe physical properties of dielectrics and , as discussed in section [ s : preliminary ] , involves relaxation and response functions of exponential type ; we refer to this purpose to equations ( [ debye ] ) and ( [ debyerelresp ] ) .    as revealed by a number of experiments , a broad variety of dielectric materials exhibits relaxation behaviours which strongly deviate from the exponential debye law .",
    "the observation of `` anomalous '' phenomena such as broadness , asymmetry and excess in the dielectric dispersion has motivated the proposition of new empirical laws in order to modify the debye relaxation and match experimental data in a more accurate way .    in 1970s , after analyzing the dielectric properties of several materials , jonscher and his co - workers propounded the existence of a universal relaxation law ( url ) following a fractional power law dependence and capable of fitting most of the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the url proposed by jonscher is an empirical law in which the ratio of the imaginary to the real part of the susceptibility is assumed to be constant and characterized by two power law exponents , say @xmath78 ( for low frequencies ) and @xmath79 ( for high frequencies ) , with @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "in particular , once we distinguish the real and imaginary part of the complex susceptibility , namely @xmath81 , it is assumed that @xmath82 and @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the characteristic relaxation time .",
    "it is nowadays well established that the relaxation properties of a large variety of materials obey to this law and some models proposed in literature ( before and after the work of jonscher ) fit in an excellent way the jonscher s url ; this is the case , for instance , of the    * cole - cole ( cc ) model , * havriliak - negami ( hn ) model , * modified hn or jurlewicz - weron - stanislavsky ( jws ) model .",
    "there also exist materials whose relaxation data can be interpreted in an accurate way only by means of different types of experimental fitting functions which do not completely fit the jonscher s url , as for the    * kohlrausch - williams - watts ( kww ) model , * davidson - cole ( dc ) model , * excess wing ( ew ) model .",
    "as it will be better illustrated further on , the dc , hn , jws and ew models are closely related to the cc model since they are obtained from similar complex susceptibilities , mainly based on the insertion of real powers in the susceptibility of the debye model .",
    "conversely , the derivation of the kww model is made in a completely different way and a closed - form representation of its complex susceptibility is not available ( a comparison of dc and kww models is discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "to some extent , the cc model ( together with the dc , hn , jws and ew models ) and the kww model represent two large and distinct families of relaxation models for dielectrics @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , an attempt of creating a mathematical bridge between these two distinct families has been proposed by capelas , mainardi and vax in @xcite , where a more general model combining cc and kww models was introduced ; we will outline also this model which is indicated as the    * capelas - mainardi - vaz ( cmv ) model .",
    "the above list of dielectric models is obviously not exhaustive .",
    "other models have been discussed in literature , but most of them can be obtained from one of the above models .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of the model proposed in 1999 by raicu @xcite , which is not treated in this survey since it can be reverted in a special case of the hn model , or the model based on fractional order operators of hyper - bessel type ( for details one can see in @xcite ) , and still having cm relaxation functions , investigated in @xcite . in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we illustrate each model and we discuss their main features under a mathematical perspective .      the cole - cole model , named after the brothers k.s . cole and r.h .",
    "cole , was introduced in 1941 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "as described in @xcite , it finds applications in `` systems with rather small deviations from a single relaxation time , e.g. many compounds with rigid molecules in the pure liquid state and in solution in non - polar , non - viscous solvents '' . nowadays",
    "this model is still used to represent impedance of biological tissues , to describe relaxation in polymers , to represent anomalous diffusion in disordered systems and so on @xcite .",
    "the complex susceptibility of the cole - cole model is derived by inserting a real power in the original debye model , thus to fit data presenting a broader loss peak , and it is given by @xmath85 where @xmath84 denotes a reference relaxation time .",
    "it is an elementary task to verify that @xmath86 fits the jonscher s url with @xmath87 and @xmath88 , as enhanced in figure [ fig : chi_url_cc ] ; unless otherwise specified , in all the subsequent plots a normalized relaxation time @xmath89 is assumed .    .",
    "]    by operating the laplace inversion of ( [ eq : chi_cc ] ) we get the corresponding response and relaxation functions respectively as @xmath90 and @xmath91    we report in figure [ fig : rel_cc ] the plots of the relaxation function @xmath92 using linear ( left plot ) and logarithmic ( right plot ) scales .     on varying @xmath93.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=46.0% ]   on varying @xmath93.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=46.0% ]    the plots of the relaxation and response functions are also found in mainardi s book @xcite along with their asymptotic representations . here",
    "we just recall that by using standard results on the asymptotic behaviour of the mittag - leffler function it is possible to verify that @xmath94 and @xmath95    it is interesting to note that the cole brothers were not initially interested to express relaxation and response in terms of mittag - leffler functions in @xcite , but , soon one year later @xcite , they made reference for these functions to the treatise by davis of 1936 @xcite .",
    "indirect references to mittag - leffler functions in anomalous dielectric relaxation can be found in the works by gross of 1937 @xcite , of 1938 @xcite , of 1941 @xcite , but more explicitly in the 1939 papers by his student f.m de oliveira castro @xcite .",
    "later , in 1947 gross @xcite has explicitly proposed the mittag - leffler function in mechanical relaxation in the framework of linear viscoelasticity .",
    "this argument was revisited in 1971 by caputo and mainardi @xcite in order to propose the so - called fractional zener model making use of the time fractional derivative in the caputo sense . a function strictly related to the mittag - leffler function",
    "was introduced by rabotnov in 1948 @xcite and soon later numerical tables of the rabotnov function appeared by his collaborators .",
    "however , the first plots of the mittag - lefller function appeared only in the 1971 papers by caputo and mainardi @xcite . nowadays , because of the relevance of this function in fractional calculus as solution of differential equations of fractional order , a number of computing routines are available , by gorenflo et al .",

    "@xcite and , more recently , by garrappa et al .",

    "consequently , the cole brothers , even though they have not explicitly used fractional derivatives or integrals , can be considered as `` indirect '' pioneers of this mathematical branch ( for an historical perspective see @xcite ) .    by the way , the cole brothers are famous because of their idea to plot the locus of the ( normalized ) complex permittivity @xmath96 in the complex plane , henceforth named after them cole - cole plots .    in figure",

    "it is not always easy to compute analytic solutions of this equation ; however , numerical methods for solving multi - term fdes are nowadays available ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .      finding suitable differential operators describing , in the time domain , the evolution equations or the constitutive law ( [ eq : constitutivelaw ] ) for the dc , hn and jws models can be less immediate than for cc or ew models .",
    "a heuristic procedure which applies to the hn model ( and hence to the special case of the dc model ) has been presented by nigmatullin and ryabov in @xcite and successively discussed in @xcite . after introducing the fractional pseudo - differential operator @xmath366 resulting from the inversion of the hn susceptibility ( [ eq : hn ] ) , by using the binomial expansions , algebra of commutator operators and the leibiniz formula for the rl derivative , it is possible to reformulate @xmath367 where the exponentials must be understood as series of factional differential operators .",
    "this compound operator is surely helpful for understanding theoretical aspects of the hn model but its practical application for computational purposes appears rather doubtful .",
    "the characterization proposed in ( [ eq : hnfracpseudoop ] ) is however particularly useful , also from the practical point of view , in the special case @xmath97 arising with the dc model because it reduces to @xmath368    hanyga in @xcite proposed the use in ( [ eq : dc_operator ] ) of the caputo derivative instead of the rl derivative @xmath369 and illustrated the derivations necessary to obtain the laplace transform of this operator @xmath370 ( the reader should note that throughout the paper we use the symbols `` @xmath162 '' and `` @xmath163 '' to distinguish between different ways to regularize fractional operators in the caputo sense ; to this purpose we refer to remark [ rem : hn_caputo2 ] ) .",
    "the same approach described in @xcite can be applied , in a straightforward way , to derive also the laplace transform of ( [ eq : dc_operator ] ) @xmath371 \\ , .\\ ] ]    in light of ( [ eq : rl_c_relat ] ) it is possible to verify that the following relationship between ( [ eq : dc_operator ] ) and ( [ eq : dc_operator_caputo ] ) holds @xmath372    in the time domain , the relationship ( [ eq : constitutivelaw ] ) between the electric field and polarization in dielectric of dc type can be therefore expressed as @xmath373 and , as expected , the standard ode describing the relaxation of debye type is returned when @xmath156 .    in the more general case connected to the hn model , i.e. @xmath374 , the operator ( [ eq : hnfracpseudoop ] ) seems of little use for computation and presents the same difficulties of the alternative approach proposed in @xcite and consisting in expanding @xmath375 by means of an infinite binomial series of fractional rl derivatives @xmath376    although the truncation of ( [ eq : hn_seriesexpansion ] ) has been used for numerical computation ( see @xcite ) , it presents a major drawback since it is not clear when the above series must be truncated in order to obtain a prescribed accuracy .    an alternative way to introduce operators for the hn model",
    "can be devised on the basis of the work presented in @xcite ( successively studied also in @xcite ) and concerning the so - called prabhakar integrals and derivatives .",
    "these operators are introduced in a similar way as the rl and caputo operators , after replacing the standard kernel @xmath377 by the following generalization of the prabhakar function @xmath378    in particular , for a function @xmath379)$ ] the prabhakar integral of orders @xmath380 and parameter @xmath381 can be defined for any @xmath382 $ ] as @xmath383 and , since ( [ eq : ml3_lt ] ) , the corresponding laplace transform is clearly given by @xmath384    under the assumption @xmath385 , the left - inverse of ( [ eq : hn_int ] ) is the special derivative @xmath386 and it is a simple exercise to verify that the corresponding laplace transform is @xmath387 where the operator @xmath388 , introduced in @xcite , is the convolution integral whose kernel is @xmath389 , i.e. @xmath390    we must note that the definition of the derivative @xmath391 on the basis of the integral ( [ eq : hn_int ] ) can appear a bit difficult to handle since the presence in the kernel of the prabhakar function , whose evaluation is usually quite difficult ( some methods have been recently proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "this kind of definition is however interesting because it allows to introduce a regularization of the same type of the regularization ( [ eq : rl_c_relat ] ) introduced for the caputo derivative ( see also @xcite ) . as proposed in @xcite , it is indeed possible to exchange integrals and derivatives in ( [ eq : hn_der ] ) , thus to introduce , for an absolutely continuous function @xmath42 , the operator @xmath392 where the letter `` c '' indicates that ( [ eq : hn_caputo ] ) can be considered as the counterpart of the caputo approach for the derivative ( [ eq : hn_der ] ) . in this case , we observe that in the laplace transform domain it is @xmath393 and hence by moving back to the temporal domain it is @xmath394 or , equivalently , @xmath395 thus establishing relationships between @xmath366 and its regularized version in the caputo sense @xmath396 , which are the analogous of the relationships ( [ eq : rl_c_relat ] ) and ( [ eq : rl_c_relat_bis ] ) holding between rl and caputo derivatives .",
    "[ rem : hn_caputo ] the operator @xmath396 can not be intended as the @xmath132 power of the caputo derivative shifted by @xmath259 , namely @xmath397 .",
    "this difference is better perceived in the limit case @xmath156 if we observe , by applying first ( [ eq : hn_der_cap_lt ] ) and hence ( [ eq : lt_c ] ) , that @xmath398 and hence @xmath399 .",
    "actually , in light of ( [ eq : hn_rl_caputo_relat ] ) it is possible to conclude that the regularizing effect of @xmath400 does not act just on the fractional derivative but also on the identity operator which returns @xmath401 instead of @xmath30 . to treat the evolution equation ( [ eq : cc_evoleq_psi ] ) for the relaxation function of the cc model as the particular case for @xmath156 of the evolution equation ( [ eq : hn_evolution_psi ] ) of the hn model",
    ", it would be necessary to introduce a caputo regularization affecting only the fractional derivative and not the identity operator as well .",
    "[ rem : hn_caputo2 ] the approach followed by hanyga in @xcite to regularize ( in the caputo s sense ) the operator @xmath402 , and consisting in replacing @xmath403 by @xmath117 in ( [ eq : dc_operator ] ) , could be followed , at least hypothetically , also for @xmath366 in ( [ eq : hnfracpseudoop ] ) .",
    "both the derivation process and the series expansion of the exponentials would however require very strong assumptions for the functions to which apply the operator , thus severely restricting its feasibility .",
    "it is clear that the caputo s regularization of operators for hn models is still an open problem which deserves further investigation . in this paper , we limit ourselves to denote with different symbols the operators obtained by hanyga ( for which the symbol `` @xmath162 '' is indeed used ) and the one ( [ eq : hn_der_cap ] ) obtained by interchanging integration and derivation ( for which the symbol `` @xmath163 '' is instead used ) .",
    "we also mention that in @xcite it has been derived a representation of @xmath404 in terms of fractional differences of grnwald - letnikov type according to @xmath405 where the coefficients @xmath406 are given by @xmath407 with @xmath408 the binomial coefficients ( [ eq : binomialcoefficients ] ) .",
    "as observed in @xcite , the coefficients @xmath409 are a generalization of the binomial coefficients @xmath349 and , indeed , it is @xmath410 .",
    "thus , for @xmath156 and @xmath411 the operator ( [ eq : hn_gl ] ) gives back the differences ( [ eq : gl_der ] ) and hence it can be considered as a generalization of the grnwald - letnikov derivative .    by using the regularized derivative @xmath396",
    "it is now possible to express the constitutive law ( [ eq : constitutivelaw ] ) for hn models as @xmath412 which can be completed by an initial condition @xmath413 .",
    "note that the use of ( [ eq : hn_gl ] ) , together with ( [ eq : hn_rl_caputo_relat ] ) , provides a tool for the discretization of this equation .",
    "a similar approach can be followed for the jws model and indeed it is easy to evaluate @xmath414",
    "we conclude this survey by presenting brief biographical notes on some of the authors who distinguished in dielectric studies and introduced the models today named after them .",
