    "the open question concerning the nature of dark matter and dark energy is certainly one of the most compelling issues of modern astrophysics , that demands new and better observations in order to be answered . until the physical properties of dark matter can be determined experimentally ( something that can not be done in the laboratory up to now ) , trying to improve our knowledge about these properties implies improving the current measurement of the cosmological parameters . in particular , in the case of dark energy , the first crucial step is to try to distinguish a cosmological constant model from time dependent quintessence models .",
    "the current best constraints on the cosmological parameters come from the combined results of three different techniques with complementary degeneracies : snia experiments , cmb measurements , and the study of galaxy clusters .",
    "in addition to these well known methods , weak lensing is emerging as one of the most powerful and robust probes of the large scale structure of the universe and the nature of dark matter and dark energy@xcite .",
    "several existing and proposed wide - field weak lensing surveys , ground - based and space borne are currently being developed . in order to contribute to the design of possible space missions we present demon ( dark energy and matter observational nexus ) , a novel concept satellite conceived to study the properties of dark matter and dark energy combining two complementary techniques : weak lensing and clusters statistics .",
    "in order to address the above science questions , demon will carry out a combined optical / ir and x - ray wide - field survey to provide the required data for weak lensing and cluster statistic studies .",
    "sections [ sec : wl ] and [ sec : cs ] explain the basis of both techniques and the usefulness of combining them to study the problem of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "the weak gravitational lensing effect is the deflection of light by large scale structures along the line - of - sight .",
    "this produces a coherent distortion of the shape of observed background galaxies ( cosmic shear ) , which contains information about the three dimensional mass distribution of the universe and also about the structure growth with time .",
    "the cosmic shear maps obtained from weak lensing surveys can be used to reconstruct the dark matter power spectrum , prove the effect of dark energy in the geometry of the universe ( geometrical tests ) , and measure the cosmological parameters analyzing the 3d shear power spectrum in redshift slices ( tomography ) .",
    "these maps can be obtained through the statistical properties of the observed ellipticity of galaxies , which requires a large statistical sample of galaxies and very good image quality to measure the galaxy ellipticities reliably .",
    "since the cosmic shear is only due to gravity , weak lensing does not suffer from galaxy bias uncertainty like the baryon oscillation technique , and is not affected by evolution and/or environmental effects as may be the case for snia .",
    "in addition , weak lensing offers a unique method to probe the matter distribution in the transition domain from quasi - linear to non - linear scales at medium redshifts which can not be addressed by any of the other techniques .",
    "studies of cosmic shear already have led to significant constraints on cosmological parameters , most noticeably on the normalization of the power spectrum@xcite .",
    "clusters of galaxies are the largest and most recently collapsed objects in the universe .",
    "while their formation and evolution are driven by gravity , their large scale distribution and growth rate are also affected by dark energy .",
    "two methods involving clusters are especially promising in cosmology : determining the redshift evolution of the matter power spectrum , and measuring the redshift evolution of the cluster mass function ( the abundance of clusters as a function of mass ) @xcite . comparing these statistical quantities with those predicted by structure formation theory allow us to measure the cosmological parameters and the equation of state of dark energy @xcite .",
    "cluster statistics require mass determination for each cluster , which can be inferred from observables such as the intracluster gas temperature in the x - ray spectrum , and the bolometric x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "some x - ray surveys of galaxy clusters have measured the power spectrum and the cluster mass function @xcite , but not its evolution with redshift .",
    "missions like xmm - newton with a random survey precludes any studies based on spatial correlation ( such as the matter power spectrum ) .",
    "these effects are even more important for the chandra x - ray mission and the planned xeus ( x - ray evolving universe spectroscopy mission ) and constellation - x mission , with their smaller fields of view .    in order to reach estimates with errors of a few percent , observations of ten thousand galaxy clusters in contiguous fields and with well defined completeness",
    "are needed@xcite .",
    "this goal can be efficiently accomplished by a wide - field x - ray survey .",
    "in addition , the mass@xmath3luminosity / temperature relations needed for cluster statistics studies can be considerably improved with additional mass measurements @xcite provided by alternative methods like weak lensing @xcite . since weak lensing and cluster statistics also provide complementary measurements of the cosmological parameters , it is very suitable to combine them in the same mission .",
    "the main goal of the demon satellite is to provide optimum quality data for weak lensing studies , the scientific requirements are discussed further in sect .",
    "[ sec : weaklensreq ] . on the other hand , since cluster statistic studies are an interesting additional feature for the mission , we intend to take advantage of the x - ray telescopes developed for the erosita mission to carry out a simultaneous x - ray survey .",
    "the characteristics of such an x - ray survey are explained in sect .",
    "[ sec : xrayreq ] .",
    "since the weak lensing technique is based on measurements of galaxy shapes , high image quality is a mandatory requirement in order to achieve optimal results .",
    "that makes a space - based wide - field survey the natural option to overcome the limitations produced by the degradation of the images in ground based surveys ( smearing due to atmospheric seeing , psf instabilities , weather instabilities and telescope instabilities due to flexures and wind - shake ) .",
    "a space telescope provides a diffraction limited and stable point spread function ( psf ) minimizing the systematics of the images , and allowing the detection of more faint resolved galaxies .    in order to provide a high sample of galaxies to minimize statistical errors , we need a large sky coverage and a high number density of resolved galaxies for shape measurements@xcite . with a limiting magnitude of @xmath4 , a galaxy density of @xmath5",
    "is expected@xcite .",
    "this provides a galaxy sample with @xmath6@xcite , suitable to probe the range@xcite @xmath7 in which the effect of dark energy is more prominent@xcite . according to tyson et al.@xcite",
    ", ellipticity values can be retrieved for galaxies larger than 1.2@xmath8psf . since galaxies with @xmath4 have mean sizes ( @xmath9half - light radius ) of @xmath10 @xcite",
    ", we need a telescope with a full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the psf @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , accurate measurements of galaxy shapes require a fwhm sampling of at least @xmath12 pixels for a proper psf deconvolution .    to assess the above scientific requirements ,",
    "we studied a baseline model consisting of a 2 meter telescope similar to the one suggested for snap@xcite ( supernova / acceleration probe ) . we intend to cover 5000 @xmath13 with an exposure time of 4 ks per filter .",
    "the instrumentation requirements are described in sect .",
    "[ sec : opt_inst ] .    weak lensing tomography also requires the determination of the photometric redshifts of the galaxy sample ( too big for spectroscopic redshift measurements ) which can be obtained with a targeted accuracy of the order of @xmath14 using 8 filters @xcite .",
    "since it is not practical to include them all in a single spacecraft , a ground - based optical wide - field imaging survey done in parallel will be needed to achieve the mentioned accuracy .",
    "the minimum requirement for the ground - based survey is a 4 meter diameter optical telescope with a 3 deg@xmath15 field of view ( fov ) operating in the u , b , v , and r bands .",
    "projects of this kind , such as vista , kids , pan - starrs ... are currently being developed .",
    "the ir filters should be included in the spacecraft , since the sensitivity of ground - based ir observations is severely limited by atmospheric and thermal effects .      the kind of x - ray survey that we can perform with demon is determined by : ( 1 ) the sky coverage ( 5000 @xmath13 ) and exposure time ( 16 ks per pointing ) imposed by the weak lensing mission requirements , and ( 2 ) the technical specifications of the x - ray telescopes developed for the erosita mission ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : xray_inst ] for details ) .",
    "the erosita telescopes are optimized for cluster statistics studies . in particular",
    ", they provide an angular resolution of @xmath16 , suitable to distinguish between galaxy clusters and point - like x - ray sources@xcite . with an energy resolution of 130 ev at 6 kev",
    ", they also provide an x - ray spectrum with enough resolution to measure the mean cluster gas temperature .",
    "an x - ray instrument composed by 8 of such a telescopes will have a total fov of 3.55 @xmath13 .",
    "combined with an exposure time of @xmath17 ks per pointing , such an instrument will reach a minimum flux of @xmath18 erg @xmath19 s@xmath20 in the energy range @xmath21 kev . under this conditions ,",
    "the demon x - ray survey is expected to detect @xmath1 20 clusters per  @xmath13 and identify , in the observed region of the sky , all the clusters with a mass @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 up to @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , demon will produce a catalog of @xmath2 clusters with a mean redshift of 0.75 .",
    "the flux - selection will avoid the contamination from clusters highly affected by non - gravitational heating , mainly non massive and non relaxed@xcite .",
    "the study of the evolution of the matter power spectrum and cluster mass function requires an error @xmath26 in the cluster redshift measurements@xcite .",
    "this information will be provided by the demon ( combined with the required ground - based survey ) with a median accuracy of 0.07 for the redshift of each galaxy .",
    "therefore , redshift measurements of @xmath27 galaxies per cluster will be enough to achieve the required precision .",
    "another interesting feature of the demon compared to other x - ray surveys is that , due to the flux limit and survey area that is going to cover , it will explore a measurement domain that was not done before .",
    "the baseline optical concept will comprise a 2 m diameter optical / ir telescope encircled by eight 0.358 m diameter x - ray telescopes .",
    "below , the optical / ir and x - ray telescopes and detectors are described .",
    "the specifications of both instruments are summarized in tables [ tab : opt_telescope ] and [ tab : xrayparam ] .",
    "the main demon optical / ir instrument is a three - mirror anastigmatic korsch telescope@xcite ( see figure  [ fig : mirror ] ) .",
    "this configuration produces an achromatic image limited by diffraction over a planar field of more than 1 @xmath13 , and has been used extensively in space .",
    "honeycomb sandwich mirror technology is chosen to minimize the mass of the mirror .",
    "c    demon will be equipped with 4 filters : one optical broad - band filter to measure the galaxy shapes ( r+i+z , centered at 0.8 @xmath28 m with 0.2 @xmath28 m width ) , and 3 ir filters to determine the photometric redshifts ( j , h and k ) .    in the broad band filter ,",
    "the size of the telescope fwhm psf is @xmath29 , which requires an angular resolution of @xmath30/pixel ( to be properly sampled ) and a pixel size of 5 @xmath31 .",
    "since this pixel size is much smaller than the current technology available , the demon pointing strategy will take advantage of micro - dithering@xcite the integration time is divided into two sub - pointings separated by half a pixel .",
    "this allows us to use a pixel @xmath32 times larger .",
    "combined with a magnifying lens system ( to enlarge the image by a factor of 1.5 ) , the psf can then be properly sampled using 10 @xmath31 pixels .",
    "since there is no need for this high resolution for the infrared filters , we can use ir detectors with the standard pixel size of 18 @xmath31 ( @xmath33/pixel ) .",
    "the demon focal plane is a ring with a partially vignetted area in the center , where the detectors are situated in four 20 @xmath8 40 rectangular areas ( see figure  [ fig : detector ] ) .",
    "the four filters are settled in one direction to cover the same fov , which requires an orthogonal scanning strategy . in total demon",
    "will have 128 ccds ( 2627@xmath82627 pixels each ) for the broad - band filter , and 80 ir pixel arrays ( 2335@xmath8973 pixels each ) for each of the ir filters .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     [ demon_telecom ]",
    "this paper presents a new concept mission for a satellite aimed at provide better constraints on the cosmological parameters and , in particular , studying the evolution of the dark energy equation of state with time .",
    "the innovate concept of the demon spacecraft is to carry out a combined optical / ir and x - ray survey of 5000 @xmath13 to perform weak lensing and cluster statistics studies .",
    "the satellite is meant to be complemented by one of the ground - based wide - field surveys currently under development , to provide the best accuracy in the photometric redshift measurements required .",
    "for the optical / ir part of the survey , we investigated telescope design similar to the one proposed by snap . to sample the fwhm psf with @xmath12 pixels ( something crucial for weak lensing studies ) , the proposed telescope requires a pixel size of 5 @xmath34 .",
    "this technology is currently under development and is expected to be available within 5 years ( j. w. beletic , director of sensor systems of rockwell scientific , private communication ) .",
    "an alternative possibility consist on use micro - dithering in the pointing strategy and include an additional magnification of 1.5 in the optical system .",
    "this configuration allows in principle to sample the fwhm psf with @xmath12 pixels using ccds of 10 @xmath28 m .",
    "however , the derived consequences in the technical telescope design and image quality should be investigated in detail to determine the feasibility of this option .    for the x - ray part of the mission",
    ", we explore the possibility to include 8 x - ray telescopes in the spacecraft , taking advantage of the technology developed for the erosita mission .",
    "the result is an x - ray survey with a flux limit of @xmath18 erg @xmath19 s@xmath20 ( 10 times more sensitive than duo@xcite and 5 times more sensitive than erosita ) that will identify all the clusters with a mass @xmath22 @xmath35 @xmath24 up to @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the demon @xmath37 x - ray survey is expected to produce a catalog of @xmath2 clusters with a mean redshift of 0.75 .",
    "the final spacecraft is 7.1 m high and 3.75 m wide ( at its broadest parts ) .",
    "it has an estimated mass of 2500 kg , which is well within the transport capabilities of a soyuz rocket into the desired leo orbit .",
    "the estimated cost of the spacecraft is 510 m euro  ( see table  [ table : costs ] for details ) .",
    "the demon concept design shows that combining an optical and x - ray survey in the same spacecraft is technically possible and very interesting in terms of costs .",
    "in addition , it is able to provide high quality data for both weak lensing and cluster statistics , something that is not possible with the weak lensing missions proposed by snap@xcite and jedi@xcite due to their poor sampling of the fwhm psf",
    ".    we also note that , although demon is optimized for a weak lensing survey , the high quality of the observations and the wide sky coverage of the survey will provide valuable data for other studies , like strong lensing systems , baryonic wiggles , galactic structure or detailed studies of clusters of galaxies . due to the characteristics of the x - ray instruments",
    ", demon will also contribute to the study of the intracluster medium and galaxies with active nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "furthermore , a number of faint objects will be identified as future targets for narrow field instruments performing pointed imaging observations , like xeus .",
    "finally , the planned far - infrared surveys based on the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect ( e.g. the esa planck mission and south pole telescope ) will produce the redshift dependent cluster mass function and the power spectrum with different systematics compared to the demon x - ray survey , permitting for a very important cross - check of the two cosmological techniques to be made .",
