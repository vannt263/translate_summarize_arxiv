    "galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) are very old ( age @xmath213 gyr ) stellar systems populated by @xmath3@xmath4 stars .",
    "initially gcs were thought to be prime examples of simple stellar populations , i.e. , populations of coeval stars born with the same initial chemical composition .",
    "that situation began to change in the late 70 s with the first spectroscopic surveys that disclosed star - to - star chemical variations of light element abundances within individual clusters ( e.g. , cohen  1978 ) .",
    "these variations are now known to be present in a large fraction of gcs and appear in the form of well defined anticorrelations between the abundances of c - n , na - o and mg - al pairs , that can not be explained in terms of evolutionary / mixing effects ( see , e.g. , gratton et al .",
    "2000 , carretta et al .  2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "in addition there is growing observational evidence for helium ( he ) abundance variations within a few clusters which we discuss below .",
    "the presence of specific chemical patterns supports a scenario invoking multiple star formation events in some , perhaps most , gcs .",
    "these took place at the very beginning of the cluster evolution on relatively short time - scales , of the order of @xmath5myr .",
    "the younger generations could have been born out of gas enriched by the winds of intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch stars ( agbs ; e.g. , ventura et al .",
    "2009 ) or massive fast rotating stars ( decressin et al .",
    "2007 ) formed during the first star formation episode .",
    "dynamical simulations , e.g. , by dercole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and decressin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , have investigated how these winds could have been retained by the clusters an incorporated into future generations of stars .",
    "one of the challenges facing self - enrichment scenarios in a few clusters is that they must be able to account for appreciable differences in the helium mass fraction ( @xmath6 ) between different generations , with @xmath6 reaching values up to twice the primordial abundance while at the same time not appreciably altering the abundances of most other elements like iron .",
    "a notable exception is @xmath7 centauri ( ngc  5139 ) , where the main sequence ( ms ) splitting detected by bedin et al .",
    "2004 has been interpreted as due to he variation ( with the richest population having @xmath8 ; piotto et al .",
    "2005 ) and where at least five distinct populations with different iron content and possibly different ages have been revealed ( pancino et al .",
    "2002 , ferraro et al .",

    "however @xmath9cen may not be a genuine gc , but rather the remnant of a dwarf galaxy partially disrupted by the interaction with the milky way ( bekki & freeman  2003 , mackey & van den bergh  2005 ) . a similar system ( terzan  5 ) harboring two distinct populations with different iron content and ( possibly ) ages has been recently found in the galactic bulge ( ferraro et al .",
    "similarly , this system is suspected to be not a genuine gc , but instead the remnant of a larger system that contributed to the formation of the galactic bulge",
    ". a milder evidence of internal spread of the metal content ( @xmath10 [ fe / h ] @xmath11 ) has been observed also in m22 ( marino et al .",

    "2009 ) .    in the context of the multi - population scenarios ,",
    "one of the most puzzling cases is that of ngc  2808 .",
    "the first photometric observations ( harris  1974 , ferraro et al .  1990 ) revealed a horizontal branch ( hb ) with a very complex structure .",
    "the cluster hb is well populated both at colours redder than the rr  lyrae instability strip and along its hot blue tail ( bt ) that covers a range of @xmath12 mag below the mean level of the instability strip .",
    "this morphology is not easily explained in terms of the cluster metallicity ( @xmath13}\\sim-1.3 $ ] ) , since it is well outside the common paradigm that links red hbs to metal - rich gcs and blue - hbs to metal - poor systems . in this sense",
    "ngc  2808 is similar to other very massive ( and much more metal rich ) gcs , like ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ( rich et al .  1997 ,",

    "( 2005 ) first noticed a broadening of the ngc  2808 ms which was incompatible with photometric errors .",
    "they suggested that the ms consisted of two components with the same age and [ fe / h ] , but different initial he abundances , with @xmath14 for the he - rich component .",
    "the complex ms structure was confirmed by an accurate photometric and proper motion analysis with deep hubble space telescope ( hst ) data ( piotto et al .",
    "they found that the ms of ngc  2808 splits into three sub - populations , all with age @xmath15gyr and @xmath16 for the red - ms , @xmath17 for the mean - ms and @xmath18 for the blue - ms .",

    "we used a set of images ( prop . 6864 , p.i .",
    "fusi pecci ) covering optical to far - uv wavelengths , obtained with the wide field planetary camera  2 ( wfpc2 ) on board the hst .",
    "the wfpc2 is a mosaic made of four @xmath22 pixels cameras , with angular resolutions of @xmath23pixel for the planetary camera ( pc ) and @xmath24pixel for the three wide field cameras ( wf2 , wf3 and wf4 ) .",

    "all the images have the same pointing , with the cluster centre roughly centred in the pc ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "we combined the images using the iraf task _ imcombine _ in order to improve the signal to noise ratio and decontaminate them from cosmic rays , which are particularly prominent in long exposure data . for a given passband and exposure time we adopted the resulting median frame as reference image for the data reduction .",
    "as done in our previous work ( see for example dalessandro et al .",

    "specifically developed to perform accurate photometry in crowded regions ( buonanno & iannicola  1984 ) .",
    "because of under - sampling problems related to the point spread function ( psf ) of stars in the far - uv images , we used aperture photometry performed with the publicly available software source extractor ( sextractor , bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "the adopted aperture radii were 2 pixels ( corresponding to @xmath32 ) for the wf chips and 3 pixels ( @xmath33 ) for the pc .",
    "for the wf cameras , because of strong vignetting problems affecting the upper right corners of all the @xmath34 images , the regions @xmath35 $ ] have been excluded from the analysis . in each filter for every star detected , the photometric error has been defined as the standard deviation of all the measures obtained .",
    "the final star list includes all the sources detected in at least 2 filters .",
    "hot stars detected in @xmath34 and not automatically found in the optical data were force - fitted in the optical images .",
    "this procedure added 1015 hb stars in the f336w and f555w images .",
    "these stars are typically a magnitude fainter than the to level in the optical cmd ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "this approach allowed us to sample in a proper way both the cool sequences ( like ms and rgb ) thanks to the optical bands , and the very hot ones ( extremely blue hb stars ) because of the sensitivity of the far - uv bands to high temperatures .",
    "our photometric strategy assured a very high degree of completeness in our samples .",
    "in particular , selecting stars where they are the brightest and then finding the corresponding stars in the plane where they are faint , guarantees an high completeness level in each plane .",

    "in the canonical view , the hb is expected to be populated by stars with different masses , decreasing from cold to hot effective temperatures , all undergoing central he - burning and shell h - burning .",
    "given that the mass of the he - core at the start of the hb phase ( zero age horizontal branch ",
    "zahb ) is almost constant ( @xmath49 ) and equal to the core mass at the he - flash , the location of each star along the hb is essentially determined by the mass of the surrounding envelope that survives the mass - loss episodes during the rgb phase . from the observational point of view , the first physical parameter affecting the hb morphology is the metallicity .",
    "metal rich clusters usually have red hbs , while the metal - poor ones tend to have hbs populated at bluer colours .",

    "hence , the red clump stars have been selected in the optical cmd ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) , that is more sensitive to relatively cool stars , while the hottest hb stars were selected in the far - uv cmd , where they are the most luminous sources .",
    "these selection criteria allow also a more accurate distinction between pure hb and post - hb stars .",

    "the bhb stars define a sort of `` knee '' in the stellar distribution and are significantly brighter than the rhb clump in this plane .",
    "figure  [ teo4 ] shows very clearly that even including radiative levitation , the magnitude level of the bhb sub - population is not reproduced by the zahb with canonical helium abundance ( @xmath70 ) : the bhb appears significantly ( 0.30.4 mag ) brighter than the canonical zahb . on the other hand , the `` levitation '' zahb with @xmath97 matches very nicely the lower envelope of the bhb star distribution .",

    "figure  [ teo5 ] shows the cmd of the three bluest sub - populations , together with the zahb for different initial values of @xmath6 , with and without inclusion of levitation .",

    "additional interesting features emerge from this figure :    1 .",
    "just as it was in the ( @xmath67 , @xmath52 ) cmd , the bhb population is matched by a zahb with @xmath97 including the effect of levitation .",
    "the ehb population is consistent with a zahb with @xmath101 including levitation .",
    "the bhk stars are too hot to be reproduced by any zahb models , hence they require a more separate discussion ( see section 4.3 )    from this comparison we can safely conclude that three ( out of four ) of the sub - populations along the hb of ngc  2808 can be identified as the progeny of three distinct stellar populations with different initial helium abundances in the range @xmath1020.40 .",
    "the specific values used ( @xmath70 , 0.30 , 0.40 ) were set by the model data base , and we have not attempted to determine values of @xmath6 which best fit the data .",

    "had we tried to match these `` normal - he '' models to , e.g. the bhb population , it would have been impossible then to match the rhb stars with models with any reasonable value of @xmath6 .    as a second step of our analysis",
