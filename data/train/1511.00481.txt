    "x - ray free - electron lasers ( xfels ) , delivering high - brilliance x - ray pulses of femtosecond ( fs ) duration , have the potential to revolutionize our ways to probe chemical reaction dynamics and follow structural changes on the spatial and temporal scale of nuclear and electron motion .",
    "these structural changes , mostly induced by coherent pump sources in the optical , ir , thz , but also x - ray spectral region , are typically followed by analyzing the change of the electron density , as for example in time - resolved implementations of x - ray diffraction , or femtosecond serial crystallography @xcite .",
    "time - resolved x - ray emission @xcite or absorption spectroscopy @xcite , time - resolved resonant inelastic x - ray scattering @xcite and time - resolved photoelectron @xcite or auger spectroscopy @xcite are complementary analysis tools to study chemical and structural changes .",
    "the combination of x - ray emission spectroscopy with x - ray crystallography within one experimental setup allows the study of both structural and chemical dynamics @xcite at the same experimental conditions and might evolve into a powerful tool .",
    "time - resolved x - ray emission spectroscopy of chemically and biologically relevant samples , however , often suffer of small signal rates , that could be overcome by coherent amplification of the signal by stimulated x - ray emission @xcite . most notably , pump - probe experiments could take advantage of recording good - quality spectra under a single xfel exposure . here",
    ", we address the question of coherent signal amplification of a spectroscopic , photon - in photon - out technique  resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs )  with xfel sources and present a feasibility study on stimulated inelastic x - ray scattering of molecular gases with intrinsically incoherent self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase ) radiation of xfels .",
    "our studies aim for quantitative predictive signal estimates , to critically assess new opportunities of stimulated inelastic x - ray scattering at present - day xfel sources .",
    "rixs is a widely applied spectroscopic technique , that probes both un - occupied and occupied electronic states , and is sensitive to electronic , vibrational and elementary collective excitations @xcite .",
    "applications are wide , ranging from solid state physics @xcite , to high - resolution vibrational spectroscopy of molecules in the gas phase @xcite , hydrogen bonding in liquids @xcite , and studies of charge transfer @xcite , etc .",
    "compared to inelastic x - ray scattering far above any absorption edges , rixs adds the advantage of element specificity of the scattering process , by tuning the photon energy of the incoming beam close to inner - shell ionization edges of a specific element in a molecular complex . in that way",
    ", catalytic reaction centers in large molecular complexes , often containing heavy elements and metals , can be specifically probed , and relevant chemical information , for example the oxidation state of a particular element in a catalytic reaction , or changes of the valence in charge - transfer processes , can be measured by a sensitive method .    with the invention of xfels , providing x - ray pulses of fs duration , inelastic x - ray scattering is therefore becoming a viable tool to study the structural dynamics of optically induced changes in the gas , liquid and solid phase and at interfaces with fs time resolution .",
    "the information wealth of rixs lies in the scanning of the incoming photon energy in fine steps through absorption resonances and absorption bands and recording of the emission spectrum with high energy resolution @xcite .",
    "being a photon - in photon - out technique , the information is typically presented in a two - dimensional map , which displays a full rixs spectrum for series of excitation spectrum in a conventional x - ray absorption spectroscopy scan . at third - generation x - ray sources based experiments ,",
    "rixs measurements are performed by using a high - resolution monochromator . at xfel sources ,",
    "the use of monochromators requires averageing over many x - ray pulses , since the effective number of photons in the monochromator band pass is highly fluctuating .",
    "a combination of self - seeded xfel pulses @xcite and monochromators is a practicable experimental setting to overcome this deficiency for high - resolution rixs studies at xfel @xcite . here , we want to address stimulated rixs ( srixs ) , i.e. stimulated resonant inelastic ( raman ) x - ray scattering , as an alternative route , to record high - resolution rixs spectra .    stimulated electronic x - ray raman scattering",
    "was recently realized in atomic neon gas @xcite , demonstrating coherent signal amplification by several orders of magnitude ( as compared to spontaneous rixs ) .",
    "due to the stochastic nature of sase pulses , a refined theoretical treatment @xcite was necessary , to unambiguously demonstrate this effect .",
    "in usual rixs measurements , the emission wavelength shows a linear dispersion with respect to the incoming photon energy of a narrow - band x - ray source .",
    "a typical rixs spectrum with a sase spectral profile , consisting of mutually phase - uncorrelated spectral intensity spikes , can be understood as an incoherent sum of rixs spectra of narrow - band sources with different detuning from the studied resonance .",
    "a rixs spectrum recorded with a sase pulse therefore shows strong shot - to shot fluctuations , with line shifts that are of stochastic nature . a covariance analysis of an ensemble of single - shot spectra , however , can be applied to reveal 2d maps similar to high - resolution rixs maps . the goal of this work is to extend srixs to molecular gas targets .",
    "similar to the x - ray lasing ( amplified spontaneous emission ) in molecular targets @xcite , that typically shows considerably lower gain as compared to the atomic case , raman gain , or srixs cross sections in molecules tend to be considerably lower .",
    "reasons for the smaller gain are the addition of vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom in molecular samples : the electronic transition dipole matrix elements in molecules are lowered by franck - condon overlaps .",
    "the gain is distributed over many vibrational channels . in an unaligned ensemble of molecules , there is a mismatch of the molecular transition dipoles with the emitted radiation , resulting in smaller stimulated emission cross sections . a way to circumvent the problem of small srixs cross section in molecular targets ,",
    "is to provide seed photons to stimulated the scattering process . in our previous srixs experiment in atomic neon @xcite seed photons",
    "were provided by the spectral tails of the relatively broad sase pulses .",
    "an alternative is to operate the fel in recently established two - color modes @xcite , providing two narrow - band sase pulses within the usual broadband sase gain bandwidth ( up to @xmath1 0.1 - 1 % ) .",
    "the two central sase energies should therefore overlap with the energy of the pump resonance and the inelastic electronic transition ( `` dump '' transition ) one wants to amplify ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . since a core - excited state",
    "can typically decay to different electronic final states , by varying the dump transition energy , different valence - excited electronic states can be probed selectively .",
    "this is of special interest for `` dark '' emission channels , that in conventional rixs experiments are hidden by strong neighboring transition lines .",
    "a single pair of sase pulses will certainly couple to many different vibrational levels within a single pulse .",
    "a much clearer situation could be achieved by applying two narrow - band transform limited pulses .",
    "two - color seeded fel schemes are , however , currently available only at the euv fel source fermi in trieste @xcite .",
    "here we discuss a statistical approach , based on a covariance analysis of the acquired srixs spectra in the two - color sase scheme , that enables to unravel the rich vibrational structure of the involved electronic states .",
    "the high - energy resolution on the vibrational level using broad - band sase pulses is possible due to the limited spectral coherence ( average spike width in the spectral domain of the structured sase pulses ) @xcite . statistically speaking",
    ", the covariance method provides srixs spectra that would have been obtained by varying pairs of coherent , narrow - band sources , with a spectral width that is smaller than the vibrational energy spacing and the core - hole lifetime .",
    "the sase pulse - parameter regime , hence , does not allow coherent impulsive stimulated raman scattering , to pump coherent vibrational or electronic wave packets , as discussed in applications of impulsive srixs ( or as stimulated electronic ray raman scattering ) in the many different pulse - schemes for nonlinear x - ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] we present the two - color scheme of srixs with sase x - ray pulses ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] the theoretical model and the numerical approach are outlined ; results on the co molecular are discussed in in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] , and the method of covariance analysis is introduced ( sec . [",

    "sec : exp ] .",
    "high - resolution srixs spectra can be achieved in principle using a two - color x - ray source of well defined discrete frequencies @xmath2 , tuned to the energy of a specific core - excited electronic state , and @xmath3 , which probes inelastic scattering channels to a specific valence excited final state .",
    "independent variation of @xmath2 and @xmath3 allows to build a two - dimensional srixs map @xmath4 , similar to the usual rixs maps recorded at 3^rd^ generation x - ray light sources . in the case of weak fields",
    "the information content that can be gained in this scheme is comparable to a conventional , spontaneous rixs measurement at a synchrotron source , if the initial state of the system is the ground state . in conventional rixs",
    "the full emission spectrum can be collected for one fixed incoming photon energy @xmath2 , while the srixs method with a coherent x - ray source of two well - defined frequencies @xmath2 and @xmath3 requires additional scanning of the energy @xmath3 and hence does not provide any advantages compared to conventional time - resolved rixs measurements at xfels @xcite .",
    "here we apply the two - color sase xfel scheme for a benchmark study of carbon - monoxide ( co ) , representing the class of abundant @xmath5conjugated systems @xcite",
    ". near - edge x - ray absorption fine structure ( nexafs ) spectra at the k - edge of many oxygen , nitrogen and carbon containing molecules conjugated by p - orbitals show a strong pre - edge resonance related to excitation of the @xmath6 electron to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital @xcite .",
    "this bound - to - bound transition dominates over other pre - edge resonances and coupling to the electronic continuum .",
    "the transition is typically isolated from the rydberg resonances , thus ensuring x - ray scattering via an isolated intermediate electronic state , and making it particularly interesting for the study of valence - excited states of neutral molecules by rixs . in the present paper we focus on the numerical simulations for the ok - edge of co. the developed method , however , are general and can be directly applied to the ck - edge of co , nk- and ok - edges of n@xmath7 , o@xmath7 , no and other diatomic and small polyatomic molecules .    in conventional ok pre - edge rixs spectra in co , three partially overlapping excited valence states  @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10  have been identified , by resonant scattering via the @xmath6-@xmath11 resonance @xcite . stimulated x - ray scattering with a pair of narrow - band sase pulses allows to particularly address one of these valence excited electronic final states . in an unaligned ensemble of co molecules in the ground state ,",
    "the linear polarized xfel pump pulse tuned to the @xmath6-@xmath11 resonance preferentially couples to a sub - ensemble of molecules with their axis aligned orthogonal to the e - field polarization vector ( the @xmath12 transition dipole moment is orthogonal to the molecular axis ) .",
    "the dump pulse , having the same polarization direction as the pump , stimulates emission from the core - excited sub - ensemble of co@xmath13 molecules mainly on the @xmath14 transitions , while the srixs cross section to the @xmath15 final state is suppressed due to the dipole interaction symmetry .",
    "the potentials of @xmath16 and @xmath9 states are almost parallel , and therefore have a very similar vibrational rixs profile . in our current analysis , we restrict our study to a single final state , the @xmath10 , that will dominate the srixs spectrum .",
    "in order to get realistic signal estimates and understand propagation effects of the srixs process , we employ a theoretical scheme that follows the evolution of the molecular system , including vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom self consistently with the evolution of the electric field as a function of time and propagation distance through the medium .",
    "the theoretical scheme , is a generalization of previous work @xcite .",
    "the optically pumped medium can be considered as one - dimensional , given the geometry of the typical setup @xcite , that is roughly of cylindrical shape of large aspect ratio : in a typical experimental setup pulses are focused to a spot size of a few @xmath17 m , while the focal depth , limiting the length of the gain medium , confined in a gas cell is typically a few mm .",
    "we suppose transverse homogeneity of the focused xfel beam and therefore can use the paraxial wave approximation for modeling the x - ray field . due to the relatively large energy separation of the two sase components",
    ", we split the total electric field in two parts @xmath18 , describing the strong field component on the pump transition @xmath19 and the dump field @xmath20 .",

    "we explicitly treat three electronic states , the electronic ground state denoted by @xmath42 , the intermediate o1s core - excited state @xmath43 and the final electronic state @xmath44 .",
    "since the applied pump and dump fields and the transitions @xmath45 and @xmath46 are well separated in frequency , we suppose that the pump field @xmath47 only resonantly couples the vibrational manifolds of @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the dump field @xmath48 only directly couples @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( see fig . [ fig1](b ) ) . in that way",

    "the radiative decay of the valence - excited final states , that are dipole forbidden , are neglected ( @xmath75 ) , since the decay times are long compared to all other time scales , and decay by photoionization ( @xmath76 ) is dominating .",
    "although the overall decrease in the spectral intensity by above threshold absorption ( absorption involving transitions from the valence electrons and carbon 1s shell ) is considered in our model , the model does not include resonance absorption of o 1s electrons in molecular ions . the resonant auger decay and thus the production of molecular ions is still the dominant decay process in the system , despite stimulated inelastic scattering .",
    "in our recent experiment @xcite absorption dips of molecular ions were observed in the transmitted spectrum .",
    "however , only a few resonant transitions of molecular co ions are known in the literature @xcite and _ ab initio _ calculations of the energy position and strength of the o 1s core - excited resonance position in molecular ions are not accurate enough .",
    "this makes it thus very challenging to identify the resonances that were observed in absorption and to quantitatively predict the changes of the transmitted spectrum by the diversity of absorption lines .",
    "the resonant absorption of the radiation by molecular and atomic ions is therefore omitted in our model .",
    "the experimental conditions ( mostly the optical depth ) have to be optimized to maximize the raman gain while minimizing spectral features resulting of the resonance absorption .",

    "the 1d model system is invariant with respect to rescaling of the density and length of the system , under the constraint of keeping the optical density ( density - length product ) constant . in order to reduce cpu time , we rescaled the density and length of the medium as compared to the experimental conditions : the molecular density @xmath81 was increased by a factor of 1000 , whereas the length of the medium was downscaled by a factor of 1000 to @xmath82 .",
    "the values for the pulse energy @xmath83 and number of photons in the pump ( @xmath84 ) and dump contributions ( @xmath85 ) of the sase beam ( @xmath86 ) are to be understood as effective values in the interaction region .",
    "typically the beam - line losses are on the range of 80 - 90% , which has to be accounted for , if comparing the quoted values to typical machine parameters ( that are typically quoted without taking into account transport losses to the experimental stations ) . in our calculations",
    "we suppose a cylindrical - shaped focus of a cross sectional area of @xmath87 .",

    "both , the pump and dump pulse are considered to be overlapping in time and have the same duration .",
    "these long pulse duration ensures , that the spectral coherence ( average width @xmath91 of a spectral sase spike ) is smaller than the vibrational level spacing , i.e. @xmath92 ev , a prerequisite to obtain vibrationally resolved spectra ( see sec .",
