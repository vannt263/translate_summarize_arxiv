    "the latter case represents a particular instance of ac - driven electron heat transport @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized that the effect of nonadiabatic driving can be very similar to that of an energetic , far - from - equilibrium energy source that promotes inelastic transmission of electrons through a spatially asymmetric setup @xcite . in this paper , we follow the approach of these works and investigate the possible use of the shot noise of a nearby quantum point contact ( qpc ) as the nonequilibrium energy source that , through capacitive coupling , induces rectification in a spatially asymmetric device which in our case will be a double quantum dot ( dqd ) system .    in mesoscopic physics , recent experimental progress in energy harvesting",
    "@xcite turned the fundamental issue of heat balance into a topic of practical interest @xcite .",
    "in particular , quantum dot setups have been argued to provide a convenient framework for the controlled transport of heat between electron reservoirs @xcite , as has been experimentally confirmed @xcite . on the other hand , it has also been argued that capacitive coupling to systems with fluctuating charges can be a source of energy and of induced heat transport @xcite , a claim that has been recently observed @xcite . a similar prediction for quantum cavity systems @xcite",
    "has also received experimental confirmation @xcite .",
    "analogous physics has been predicted for small electron systems interacting through the exchange of phonons @xcite or microwave photons @xcite    when considering electron exchange between reservoirs , one typically assumes each lead in a grand canonical state determined by its chemical potential and its temperature .",
    "then thermal excitations involve occupied states above the fermi energy and unoccupied states below .",
    "our focus lies on the associated excitation energies .",
    "consequently , we speak of cooling when electrons in states above the fermi energy are removed or when holes below are filled .",
    "thus , one way to cool a lead is to contact it with another lead at a different chemical potential while applying an appropriate energy filter which can be realized , e.g. , by the gap of a superconductor @xcite or by a resonant level .",
    "the same principle can be applied to the cooling of of a two - dimensional electron gas mediating the charge flow between two leads , as has been predicted @xcite and observed @xcite ; for a review see @xcite .",

    "the above cooling scheme , however , relies on an applied bias which also causes a net electron transfer .",

    "the advantage of using a charge - fluctuating qpc is two - fold : first , its broad - band excitation is less sensitive to small detunings .",
    "second , most recent quantum dots already include such a qpc @xcite so that our proposal can be realized readily .",
    "the behavior of quantum dot systems subject to the effect of nearby fluctuations can be studied as a particular case of the `` particle - bath '' problem , where attention is paid to the effect on a few physical variables ( or on a reduced hilbert space ) of many degrees of freedom that are mathematically traced out @xcite .",
    "the effect of the dissipative environment is that of rendering the dynamics effectively irreversible despite the time - reversal symmetry of the underlying microscopic dynamics . on a macroscopic level",
    ", irreversibility becomes manifest in the fact that heat can flow spontaneously only from a hot to a cold reservoir .",
    "such a quantum dissipation approach underlies the master equation calculation described in section 2 , where the leads degrees of freedom are traced out .",

    "this effect is captured by a prefactor @xmath25 in the tunnel hamiltonian such that @xmath26 accounts for both the qpc and its coupling to the dqd .",

    "we sketch here the derivation of the formalism of ref .",

    "for a treatment beyond the large - bias limit , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our numerical implementation of the master equation formalism",
    ", we use the many - particle eigenstates of the dqd hamiltonian as a basis and keep all off - diagonal elements of the density matrix .",
    "this ensures to capture the level repulsion stemming from the tunnel coupling , which is rather relevant for levels close to the fermi energy .",
    "to explain the central idea of the cooling mechanism , we consider the channels for the spin - up electrons and for the spin - down electrons separately .",
    "to do so , we ignore coulomb repulsion which couples the spin - up and the spin - down channels .",
    "later we will see that the interaction term in the hamiltonian   shifts the working point and affects the efficiency .",
    "we consider the dqd sketched in the upper half of fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "let us focus on the channel for the spin - down electrons and assume equal temperatures , @xmath50 .",
    "suppose that an electron enters dot  1 from the left lead at the corresponding onsite energy .",
    "the electron may proceed to dot  2 and eventually to the right lead .",
    "due to the lower occupation at higher initial energy , the opposite process occurs with lower probability .",
    "thus we expect a net transport that in the right lead fills holes below the fermi surface , which corresponds to cooling .",
    "however , this picture is incomplete .",
    "owing to the tunnel coupling between the dots , dqd eigenstates are delocalized , but in such a way that ( spin - down ) electrons in the ground state are mostly in the left dot while the excited ones dwell mostly in the right dot .",
    "therefore , electrons in the excited states are more likely to leave to the right lead , while electrons preferentially enter the ground state from the left lead . the quantitative analysis [ see eqs .   and below ] reveals that , when both leads have the same temperature and chemical potential , those processes fail to yield a net effect , i.e. , both the electric current and the heat current vanish .",
    "this is of course what one expects for such an equilibrium situation . in more technical terms ,",
    "the full description obeys detailed balance , as it should .    to obtain any net transport",
    ", we must drive the system out of equilibrium . for this purpose , we couple the dqd to a strongly biased qpc in the tunnel regime ; see the hamiltonian  .",
    "then the shot noise of the tunnel current induces transitions between the ground state and the excited state of the dqd .",
    "since the ground state is more strongly populated , we witness a net excitation and , consequently , the transport process from left to right dominates the one in the opposite direction .",
    "we thus observe both charge pumping and cooling of the right lead .",
    "the channel for the spin - up electrons behaves similarly .",
    "it yields a net transport of hot electrons from the right to the left lead , which again corresponds to cooling . in the symmetric situation",
    "@xmath51 sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , the transported charges of both spin channels compensate each other , while the energy transfer adds up . the net result is cooling of the right lead without charge accumulation .      in order to substantiate the above discussion , we have solved the master equation for a single spin channel within the rotating - wave approximation .",
    "this approximation means that , within a pauli - type master equation approach , off - diagonal density matrix elements are neglected and only the populations of the eigenstates are considered .",
    "the qpc - induced transitions between the ( single - particle ) ground state and the excited state of the dqd have been treated as a perturbation .",
    "moreover , we have ignored the doubly occupied state . while details of the calculation can be found in [ sec : analytics ] , we present here the results for the electric current and the heat balance in the limit @xmath52 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the zeeman energy gradient , @xmath55 , and the fermi functions at the qdq energies are abbreviated as @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "if the ground state lies well below the fermi surface , so that @xmath58 , while @xmath59 is significantly smaller , the prefactor involving the fermi functions becomes unity .",
    "then both the electric current and the heat balance depend only on the dqd configuration and the distance to the symmetry point .    an important implication of eqs .   and is that both vanish in the absence of the qpc , since then @xmath60 .",
    "this underlines that our treatment is consistent with detailed balance .",

    "[ fig : model ] .    for very negative gate voltage ,",
    "all four levels lie below the fermi surface and no transport occurs .",
    "when shifting all levels upwards , the excited state of the spin - up channel will cross the fermi function and a pump current from the right to the left lead sets in .",
    "the initial energy of the corresponding electrons in the right lead is far below the fermi surface .",
    "therefore the creation of holes corresponds to heating the right lead , which visible in the large positive value of @xmath67 at @xmath68 . for less negative @xmath7 ,",
    "the energy of the created holes is also less negative and @xmath69 is diminished .",
    "once the ground state also lies above the fermi energy , the process comes to rest . for positive @xmath7 ,",
    "the spin - down channel is active and adds hot electrons .",
    "while this leads to an opposite electric current , it also corresponds to heating .    for zero temperature ,",
    "the borders between the different regions are sharp and both the current and the heat balance between the peaks vanish exactly . for larger temperatures , the curves smear out . while at @xmath51 , the electric current must vanish for symmetry reasons , the heat balance assumes negative values ( see inset of fig .

    "this means that we find a cooling process in which hot electrons of the right lead are replaced by cold ones .",

    "interestingly , at zero temperature , @xmath80 irrespective of the magnetic field gradient , i.e. , not only the cooling but also the heating vanishes as expected .",
    "moreover , the data indicate that cooling is possible only on the side on which the splitting is smaller . in the symmetric situation ( dashed curve for @xmath81 ) , we already observe significant heating in the right lead . for symmetry reasons it equals the heating of the left lead .",
    "therefore , the coupling to the out - of - equilibrium qpc augments the total thermal energy , a behavior that agrees with our expectations .    a more systematic investigation of the magnetic field dependence",

    "the overview as a function of @xmath74 and @xmath75 indicates that the optimal cooling of the right is found for @xmath75 clearly smaller than @xmath74 , but not too small .",
    "one might have expected that @xmath74 should be as large as possible to ensure a strong population of the relevant states in the left lead . however , in such a case the onsite levels are strongly detuned so that the effective transition matrix element of the perturbation between the dqd eigenstates becomes small ; see [ sec : analytics ] .",
    "a most intriguing question is whether one can reduce the thermal energy of one lead even when it is already at a lower temperature than the other lead , i.e. , whether one can pump heat from cold to hot .",

    "the values of these shifts can be appreciated in the horizontal slices of both panels shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : realistic ] .",
