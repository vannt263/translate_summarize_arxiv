    "although quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is generally believed to govern strong interactions , it still can be applied to particular problems only in terms of specific model - dependent approaches , which can be distinguished by their predictions for the resonance spectra . however",
    ", such predictions can only be verified in collisions of a very restricted set of hadron pairs : a proton or a bound neutron as a target and a stable or a weakly decaying hadron as a projectile . meanwhile , various constituent quark models ( _ e.g. _ , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) predict a richer spectrum of hadron resonances than have so far been observed in experiments  @xcite . because most known baryon states were discovered in elastic @xmath7 scattering",
    ", some resonances could have been missed because of their weak coupling to the @xmath7 channels  @xcite . at the same time , a stronger coupling of those resonances to such channels as @xmath8 , @xmath5 , @xmath9 , or @xmath10 can not be excluded , and , therefore , an extensive study of these channels is very important in searching for the so - called `` missing '' resonances  @xcite .",
    "proof of their existence would constitute a strong confirmation of the validity of the constituent quark concept .",
    "although the @xmath0 meson is neither stable nor decaying weakly , the @xmath5 channel is favorable in searching for missing resonances because , owing to vector - meson dominance ( vmd )  @xcite , @xmath0 photoproduction on the nucleon may be directly related to the elastic amplitude for @xmath5 scattering . in addition , @xmath0 photoproduction provides an  isospin filter \" for the nucleon response because @xmath5 final states can originate only from @xmath11 states with @xmath12 , but not from @xmath13s with @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath5 threshold region is also especially attractive in searching for new resonances because the reaction threshold is located at the higher - energy edge of the third resonance region , in which the review of particle physics ( rpp )  @xcite shows seven @xmath11 states with masses between 1650 and 1720  mev , and then there are no observed @xmath11 states up to 1860  mev .",
    "it can not be excluded that this energy range may contain unknown @xmath11 resonances that are coupled more strongly to @xmath5 than to other meson - baryon channels .",
    "such a strong coupling to resonances in the near - threshold region is clearly seen , for example , for the two most dominant channels , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , coupled to @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons was under extensive theoretical discussion since the first high - statistics differential cross sections and polarization results were provided from saphir  @xcite , covering a broad interval in center - of - mass ( c.m . ) energy , up to @xmath17  gev with @xmath18% of the full production - angle range .",
    "many models , including coupled channel , effective lagrangian , and qcd - inspired approaches  @xcite , were developed , trying to explain the behavior of the experimental data .",
    "another high - statistics measurement of the @xmath1 differential cross sections and spin - density matrix elements was recently made by the clas collaboration  @xcite , covering c.m .",
    "energies from threshold up to @xmath19  gev .",
    "their binning in c.m .",
    "energy was much finer than from saphir  @xcite , but the production - angle coverage was narrower .",
    "unfortunately , for both saphir and clas , the data obtained in the energy region near threshold have the poorest quality .",
    "both saphir  @xcite and clas  @xcite experiments measured the photoproduction of @xmath0 via its major decay mode @xmath20 , having 89.2% branching ratio  @xcite . the analyses of those experimental data were challenging because of large background from @xmath21 produced via intermediate states different from @xmath1 . in the analysis by saphir  @xcite ,",
    "all data points were obtained by individual fits of the @xmath0 peak above the @xmath22 background . their fitting procedure experienced difficulties with describing the @xmath0 peak near threshold as a standard breit - wigner ( bw ) shape was severely distorted by phase space , and a function ( bw with parameters of @xmath0 convoluted with two gaussians describing the experimental resolutions ) used for higher energies did not work here . in the analysis by clas  @xcite ,",
    "a so - called @xmath23-factor technique was used to separate signal and background events , allowing to fit data with the event - by - event approach and to extract all results from their unbinned maximum - likelihood fits .",
    "a background contamination of @xmath0 events would be expected to improve if @xmath0 photoproduction were measured in process @xmath24 , using a radiative decay mode , @xmath25 , with 8.28% branching ratio  @xcite .",
    "other physical processes having the three - photon final state are expected to be very small . however , as shown in a preliminary analysis of the cbelsa / taps data  @xcite , the three - photon background can come from processes @xmath26 and @xmath27 when one of the four final - state photons was not detected .    in this work ,",
    "a new high - statistics measurement of the @xmath1 differential cross sections near threshold is presented .",
    "the results are based on an analysis of @xmath28 @xmath0 mesons detected via their @xmath29 decay mode .",
    "all data were divided into 20 ( 15  mev each ) bins in the incident - photon energy , @xmath4 , and 15 angular bins , covering the full range of the @xmath0 production angle .",
    "all results are obtained by individual fits of the @xmath0 peak above background in each energy - angle bin .",
    "a partial - wave analysis with extracting spin - density matrix elements from the present data is in progress , by using the @xmath23-factor technique .",
    "as the latter analysis is being performed by a theoretical group outside the a2 collaboration , their results will be published later on separately .",
    "the process @xmath24 was measured using the crystal ball ( cb )  @xcite as a central spectrometer and taps  @xcite as a forward spectrometer .",
    "these detectors were installed at the energy - tagged bremsstrahlung - photon beam produced from the electron beam of the mainz microtron ( mami )  @xcite . in the present experiment , bremsstrahlung photons , produced by the 1508-mev electrons in a 10-@xmath30 m cu radiator and collimated by a 4-mm - diameter pb collimator , were incident on a 5-cm - long liquid - hydrogen ( lh@xmath31 ) target located in the center of the cb .",
    "the energies of the incident photons were analyzed up to 1402  mev by detecting the postbremsstrahlung electrons in the glasgow tagging spectrometer ( or tagger )  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the energy of the tagged photons is mainly determined by the width of tagger focal - plane detectors and the energy of the mami electron beam used in experiments . for the mami energy of 1508  mev , such an uncertainty was about @xmath32  mev .",
    "the cb detector is a sphere consisting of 672 optically isolated nai(tl ) crystals , shaped as truncated triangular pyramids , which point toward the center of the sphere .",
    "the crystals are arranged in two hemispheres that cover 93% of @xmath33 sr , sitting outside a central spherical cavity with a radius of 25  cm , which is designed to hold the target and inner detectors . in this experiment , taps was arranged in a plane consisting of 384 baf@xmath31 counters of hexagonal cross section . it was installed 1.5  m downstream of the cb center and covered the full azimuthal range for polar angles from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "the experimental trigger required the total energy deposited in the cb to exceed @xmath36320  mev and the number of so - called hardware clusters in the cb ( multiplicity trigger ) to be two or larger . in the trigger ,",
    "a hardware cluster in the cb was a block of 16 adjacent crystals in which at least one crystal had an energy deposit larger than 30 mev .",
    "the taps information was not used in the trigger of the present experiment .",
    "more details on the experimental setup , its resolutions , and other conditions during the period of the data taking ( first half of 2007 ) are given in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the reaction @xmath37 was searched for in events identified as @xmath38 candidates , having three or four clusters reconstructed in the cb and taps together by software analysis .",
    "the cluster algorithm in software was optimized for finding a group of adjacent crystals in which the energy was deposited by a single - photon electromagnetic shower .",
    "this algorithm also works well for a proton cluster . the software threshold for the cluster energy",
    "was chosen to be 12 mev . for the @xmath38 candidates ,",
    "the three - cluster events were analyzed assuming that the final - state proton was not detected .",
    "this typically happens when the outgoing proton is stopped in the material of the downstream beam tunnel of the cb , or the proton scatters in the backward direction within the c.m .",
    "frame , resulting in such a low kinetic energy of the proton in the laboratory system that it is below the software cluster threshold .",
    "thus , including three - cluster events in the analysis is vital for measuring @xmath37 differential cross sections at very forward production angles of @xmath0 .",
    "the fraction of @xmath39 events without the detected proton varies from 2.7% at the reaction threshold to 7.6% at the highest energy of the present experiment .",
    "the selection of event candidates and the reconstruction of the reaction kinematics was based on the kinematic - fit technique .",
    "details on the kinematic - fit parametrization of the detector information and resolutions are given in ref .",
    "as discussed there , the information for the outgoing proton , if it is detected , is used in the kinematic fit without the proton kinetic energy , which has large uncertainties because of the material between the target and the crystals of the calorimeters .",
    "in addition , when energetic protons punch through the crystals , their kinetic energy can not be determined from their energy deposit . for three - clusters events ,",
    "all parameters of the outgoing proton are free variables of the kinematic fit .",
    "all three- and four - clusters events that satisfied the @xmath38 hypothesis with a probability greater than 2% were accepted for further analysis .",
    "the kinematic fitting for this hypothesis includes the four main constraints , which are based on the conservation of energy and three - momentum , and an additional constraint on the invariant mass of two outgoing photons to have the @xmath40-meson mass .",
    "the kinematic - fit output was used to reconstruct the kinematics of the outgoing particles .",
    "small misidentification of the proton with a photon for the selected @xmath39 events was observed only in the three - clusters events and only for clusters reconstructed in taps .",
    "such events were discarded based on the time of flight between a taps cluster and the cb signal with respect to the energy of the taps cluster .",
    "the determination of the experimental acceptance was based on a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of @xmath41 with an isotropic production - angular distribution and an uniform beam distribution generated from the reaction threshold up to the maximal experimental energy . to reproduce the energy dependence of the @xmath0 resonance shape near production threshold ,",
    "the reaction @xmath42 was generated first as phase space .",
    "then , the invariant mass of the @xmath29 system , @xmath43 , was folded with the breit - wigner ( bw ) function , the parameters of which were taken for the @xmath0 meson ( @xmath44  mev and @xmath45  mev ) from the rpp  @xcite .",
    "this approach allowed one to properly reproduce the folding of the bw shape with phase space .",
    "all mc events were propagated through a geant ( 3.21 ) simulation of the experimental setup . to reproduce resolutions of the experimental data , the geant output was subject to additional smearing , thus allowing both the simulated and experimental data to be analyzed in the same way . matching the energy resolution between the experimental and mc events",
    "was adjusted via reaching agreement in the invariant - mass resolutions and in the kinematic - fit stretch functions ( or pulls ) and probability distributions .",
    "such an adjustment was based on the analysis of the same data set for reactions having almost no physical background ( namely , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48  @xcite ) . after taking into account the trigger requirements in the analysis of the mc events , the average acceptance for the process @xmath41 in the a2 experimental setup",
    "was found to be about 50% .",
    "the simulation of the trigger was adjusted with the same reactions that was used for adjusting the energy resolution , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are especially sensitive to the multiplicity trigger , required two hardware clusters in the cb .",
    "the agreement of the @xmath49 differential cross sections obtained from both the @xmath50 and the @xmath51 decay modes was another cross - check for the correctness of the trigger simulation .",
    "as found out , the multiplicity trigger was not important for the present analysis , as all @xmath41 events that passed the requirement on the cb total energy to exceed 320  mev had more than one hardware cluster in the cb .",
    "as turned out , the selected experimental events with @xmath25 decays were also contaminated with some background distributed quite smoothly under the @xmath0 peak . based on the mc simulations of possible background reactions , it was found that processes @xmath26 and @xmath27 could mimic @xmath52 when one of the four final - state photons had not been detected .",
    "the background from these processes mostly contaminates the four - cluster events .",
    "events from reaction @xmath53 can mimic @xmath52 when the outgoing neutron was not detected , and they contaminate the three - cluster events .",
    "nevertheless , there was no background process found that could mimic the @xmath25 peak .",
    "because the suppression of the background processes was not possible without severe losses in @xmath25 events themselves , and the subtraction of the background processes was not possible without precise mc simulations of all possible background reactions , the @xmath25 events were measured by fitting experimental @xmath43 spectra with some function , describing the @xmath0 peak above a smooth background . to measure the @xmath37 differential cross sections , all events were divided into 20 incident - photon energy bins from the reaction threshold to @xmath54  mev .",
    "the data within each energy bin were divided into 15 identical @xmath55 bins , covering the full range from -1 to 1 , where @xmath56 was the angle between the directions of the outgoing @xmath29 system and the incident photon in the c.m .",
    "the number of @xmath57 decays observed in each energy - angle bin was determined by an individual fit of the corresponding @xmath43 spectra .",
    "the fitting procedure for one energy - angle bin is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : mpi0g_fit1]-[fig : mpi0g_fit3 ] , showing typical changes in the shape of the @xmath0 peak and the background depending on @xmath56 and @xmath4 . panels ( a ) in these figures depict the @xmath43 distributions for the mc simulation of @xmath41 fitted with a gaussian .",
    "the choice of the normal distribution for the fitting procedure is motivated by the facts that the bw shape of the @xmath0 peak is severely cut by phase space near threshold and the @xmath43 resolution strongly dominates the @xmath0-meson width ( @xmath45  mev  @xcite ) , especially for the very forward production angles of @xmath0 . because the outgoing proton is not detected for those angles , it is treated as a missing particle in the kinematic fit , resulting in a poorer @xmath43 resolution for the three - cluster events . in the case of the gaussian",
    "fits shown in panels ( a ) , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) increases from 19.3  mev for @xmath58  mev and @xmath59 to 29.2  mev for @xmath60 at the same energy , and to 32.0  mev for @xmath61  mev and the same angular bin .",
    "panels ( b ) in these three figures show the @xmath43 distributions for the mc simulation of @xmath62 , which is one of the background processes .",
    "the reaction itself was generated as @xmath63 .",
    "the production angular distribution of @xmath64 and the rest - frame @xmath65 decay distribution with respect to the @xmath66 s directions were also generated isotropically .",
    "a more precise generation of the reaction kinematics were unnecessary as these spectra were used only for obtaining initial values for parameters of the function describing the experimental background .    to separate the @xmath0 signal from the background , the experimental @xmath43 distributions were fitted with the sum of a gaussian , describing the @xmath0 peak , and a polynomial , describing the background .",
    "these fits are shown in panels ( c ) .",
    "the order of the polynomial was chosen to be sufficient for a fairly good description of the background distribution in the range @xmath67  gev/@xmath68 .",
    "typically , there was no need to use a polynomial higher than order eight .",
    "the initial values for the polynomial coefficients were taken equal to the output parameters of the polynomial fit to the mc simulation of @xmath69 . in the fits to the experimental spectra , the centroid and width of the gaussian",
    "were fixed to the values obtained from the previous fits to the mc simulation for @xmath41 , shown in panels ( a ) .",
    "this introduced additional restrictions on the background function , improving the separation of the signal and background events .",
    "as also seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : mpi0g_fit1]-[fig : mpi0g_fit3 ] , the centroid and width of the gaussian obtained from fitting to the mc simulation of @xmath41 suit the experimental @xmath0 peak very well .",
    "this confirms the agreement of the energy calibration and the detector resolution for the experimental data and the mc simulation .",
    "the number of @xmath57 decays in the experimental @xmath43 spectra was determined from the area under the gaussian . for consistency , the detection efficiency in each energy - angle bin was obtained in the same way , i.e. , based on a gaussian fit to the mc simulation for @xmath41 , instead of using the number of entries in the @xmath43 spectra .",
    "this approach allowed one to diminish the impact from some deviation of the @xmath0-peak shape from the normal distribution used in the fits .",
    "the total number of @xmath0 mesons produced in each energy - angle bin was obtained by correcting the number of @xmath57 decays observed with the corresponding detection efficiency and the @xmath57 branching ratio ( 8.28% ) from the rpp  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37 differential cross sections were obtained by taking into account the number of protons in the target and the photon - beam flux from the tagging facility .",
    "statistical uncertainties of the results were calculated from the errors given by the gaussian fits .",
    "one contribution to the systematic uncertainty comes from the uncertainty in the shape of the background under the @xmath0 peak and from the deviation of the @xmath0-peak shape from the normal distribution .",
    "this uncertainty for one energy - angle bin is independent of such uncertainties for other energy - angle bins .",
    "the magnitude of this uncertainty , the average of which comprises 6% of individual values in the differential cross sections , was estimated by fulfilling several tests with the experimental and the mc - simulation spectra . for the experimental data ,",
    "the fit was repeated with lowering the order of the polynomial used in the fitting procedure and changing the @xmath43 range fitted . for tests with the mc simulation ,",
    "the experimental distribution was replaced with the sum of the mc simulations for @xmath41 and @xmath69 and fitted as experimental data , checking how well the known number of @xmath0 events was recovered .",
    "another contribution to the systematic uncertainty , which is practically the same for all energy - angle bins , comes from the determination of the detector acceptance and the photon - beam flux ; it was estimated as 5% ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details on this kind of systematic uncertainty ) .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcs ] , the results of this work for the @xmath37 differential cross sections are compared to previous measurements at similar energies from saphir  @xcite and clas  @xcite and to model calculations from refs .",
    "the vertical error bars shown for all data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcs ] include statistical uncertainties only .",
    "as seen , the data points of this work cover the full production - angle range and have quite small statistical uncertainties .",
    "thus , combining these features of the present results with fairly small energy binning ( 15  mev in @xmath4 ) makes it possible to study the threshold - region dynamics with much better accuracy than before . as also seen , the present results are in general agreement with previous measurements in the angular range where they overlap",
    ". deviations in absolute values at some energies from the results of clas , with general agreement in the angular dependence at the same time , can be explained by a slight difference in @xmath4 , which can be very important near threshold .",
    "the results from saphir for backward angles are smaller than the present and other recent measurements .",

    "@xcite are in good agreement with the present data at higher energies . at lower energies , the predictions from ref .",
    "@xcite are larger than experiment , especially for backward angles .",
    "because the near - threshold amplitudes of this quark model are dominated by the under - threshold states @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the comparison with the present data indicates that the contributions of those two states could be overestimated in ref .  @xcite .",

    "a partial - wave analysis with extracting spin - density matrix elements from the present data is already in progress , being performed by a theoretical group outside the a2 collaboration .",
    "the results of it will be published later on separately .",
