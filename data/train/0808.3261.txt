    "coupled quantum dots ( qds ) based on two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) formed with gaas / algaas heterostructures are promising candidates for quantum logic applications because of the ability to coherently manipulate the many - body spin states by using external electromagnetic fields.@xcite recently , a coherent controlled cycle of many - body state preparation , spin - interaction and projective read - out has been achieved in laterally coupled qds.@xcite in such an experiment , the electromagnetic control of the exchange energy @xmath3 , which drives the rabi oscillations between the lowest singlet and triplet states , is of utmost importance .",

    "<S> we study the properties of a few - electron system confined in coupled elongated quantum dots ( qds ) using a model gaussian potential and the numerical exact diagonalization technique . in the absence of magnetic fields , as the aspect ratio @xmath0 between the qd extensions in the direction perpendicular and parallel to the coupling directions increases , the exchange energy exhibits a sharp variation at the specific value @xmath1 , before ( after ) which the exchange energy increases ( declines ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sharp variation occurs because of a sudden change in the single - particle configuration of the triplet state . </S>",
    "<S> the stability region with one electron in each of the qds is found to shrink , and finally vanishes as it becomes progressively easier to localize both electrons into the lower qd . for @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the first singlet - triplet transition shifts to a small magnetic fields . </S>"
