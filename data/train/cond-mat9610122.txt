    "<S> the hall conductivity in the mixed state of a clean ( @xmath0 ) type - ii s - wave superconductor is determined from a microscopic calculation within a quasiclassical approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that below the superconducting transition the contribution to the transverse conductivity due to dynamical fluctuations of the order parameter is compensated by the modification of the quasiparticle contribution . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear behaviour of the hall angle is governed by the change in the effective quasiparticle scattering rate due to the reduction in the density of states at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> the connection with experimental results is discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> the hall effect in the mixed state of type - ii superconductors has remained a theoretical puzzle for almost thirty years @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the existing phenomenological @xcite theories predict that the hall angle in the flux - flow regime is either identical to that in the normal state @xcite or constant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theories which make use of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations ( tdgl ) also find no modification of the hall conductivity in the superconducting state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions are at variance with the strongly nonlinear behaviour ( as a function of magnetic field ) found in experiments performed on both low-@xmath1 materials @xcite and high-@xmath1 cuprates @xcite . for dirty superconductors ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mean free path and @xmath4 is the superconducting coherence length ) , transport coefficients can be determined from microscopic theory by a straightforward expansion in powers of the order parameter , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the results of such a calculation for the transverse resistivity @xcite explain qualitatively the sharp increase in the hall angle observed in experiment ( </S>",
    "<S> although , to our knowledge , no systematic comparison has been made ) , and provide the physical basis for a generalized tdgl approach , in which the relaxation rate is assumed to be complex , rather than purely real , to allow for a modification of the transverse transport coefficients @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the small parameter in the expansion of the microscopic equations is proportional to both the order parameter and the mean free path , therefore , it is not small in the clean ( @xmath0 ) limit . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> a straightforward expansion is not possible and the tdgl equations are not applicable @xcite , so that an alternative approach is needed for the calculation of the transverse transport coefficients .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we give the results of a calculation of the hall conductivity of a clean s - state superconductor in the mixed state near the upper critical field , @xmath6 , which uses a quasiclassical approximation to the microscopic theory . </S>",
    "<S> we made this choice as both the normal state and superconducting properties of the low-@xmath1 compounds are well known , and comparison between theory and experiment is fraught with less ambiguity . </S>",
    "<S> the quasiclassical approach @xcite has been applied successfully in the past to study transport phenomena in superfluids @xcite and superconductors @xcite and more recently to the unconventional superconductors @xcite . the central quantity in this method is the single - particle matrix green s function @xmath7 integrated over the quasiparticle energy @xmath8 here the @xmath9 are fermionic matsubara frequencies , @xmath10 is the normalized parameterization of the fermi surface , @xmath11 is the center of mass coordinate and @xmath12 is the relative momentum . since the green s function is strongly peaked at the fermi momentum @xmath13 , which is normally far larger than any other momenta in the problem , slower varying quantities such as the self - energy and external potential can be expanded around their values at the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> the result of such an expansion @xcite in the small parameter @xmath14 is a set of transport - like equations for the quasiclassical propagator @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we have generalized these equations to include terms responsible for the hall effect in a charged superfluid . </S>",
    "<S> technical details of the derivation will be reported elsewhere @xcite , here we use the equations to determine the transverse dc - conductivity    we use linear response theory in the vector potential @xmath16 describing a constant electric field @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field @xmath18 , chosen parallel to the z - axis , is described by the vector potential @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a spherical fermi surface and use the born approximation for s - wave impurity scattering characterized by a collision rate @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial dependence of the order parameter is modeled by the periodic abrikosov vortex lattice @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the lowest energy eigenfunction of the linearized ginzburg - landau equation ( i.e. the eigenfunction of a harmonic oscillator with cooper pair mass @xmath23 and frequency @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 is the magnetic length ( @xmath26 for fields @xmath27 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is appropriate provided that the broadening of the levels in the vortex core is large compared to their spacing @xmath28 , it breaks down in the superclean regime ( cf . </S>",

    "<S> the finite lifetime is accounted for by replacing @xmath29 by @xmath30 ( angular brackets denote an average over the fermi surface ) ; corrections to the order parameter due to impurity renormalization are of the order @xmath31 and can be ignored . the equations for the unperturbed functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 and the linear , in @xmath34 , corrections to the propagator @xmath35 and @xmath36 are @xcite @xmath37 f = 2 i \\delta g </S>",

    "<S> in equations ( [ f0])-([g1 ] ) we have omitted terms whose contribution to the conductivity is of order @xmath31 smaller than that of leading order terms . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ f0 ] ) is the well - known static eilenberger equation @xcite and equations ( [ f0])-([g1 ] ) contain all the terms relevant to the hall effect for a clean type - ii superconductor in the high - field region . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from equation ( [ g1 ] ) that there are several distinct contributions to @xmath54 ( and therefore the current ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first , the quasiparticle contribution , depends on the unperturbed function @xmath33 , while the second , proportional to @xmath38 , is due to the dynamical fluctuations of the order parameter induced by the perturbing electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the third term in this equation describes the additional scattering of quasiparticles off these dynamic fluctuations ; it has the same origin as the thompson diagram in the analysis of transport in dirty superconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth term describes how as vortices move and are deformed by the transport current , the resulting gradients of the order parameter act as driving forces in the transport - like equations . finally , as the renormalization of the frequency @xmath58 in equation([g1 ] ) depends on the angular average of the quasiparticle propagator , which changes in the superconducting state , the effective transport mean free path is modified .    </S>",
    "<S> to proceed we approximate the diagonal part of the quasiclassical propagator by its spatial average @xcite . since the electromagnetic fields in a superconductor vary over distances of the order of the penetration depth @xmath59 , </S>",
    "<S> this is a very good approximation in the london limit @xmath60 ; even for compounds with moderate values of @xmath61 it remains valid for a wide field range below @xmath6 . in all of the following @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> will stand for the averaged distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> we now solve equation([f0 ] ) with the normalization condition to determine the unperturbed functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> we then determine @xmath35 and @xmath38 to leading order in @xmath62 by solving equation ( [ f1 ] ) together with the self - consistency condition for the order parameter . to accomplish this program the expression @xmath63 has to be evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> to do this we exploit the oscillatory character of the abrikosov solution and introduce raising and lowering operators @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 $ ] obeying the usual bosonic commutation relations @xmath66=1 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> if the ground state equation ( [ vl ] ) is denoted by @xmath67 , the higher eigenstates ( modes of the order parameter ) are generated by the standard procedure @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> then to make use of the properties of these operators the operator @xmath69 can be rewritten as @xmath70 $ ] and the result of its acting on any state @xmath71 evaluated explicitly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using this approach we are able to determine the unperturbed functions @xmath72^{-1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the spatial average of the order parameter and @xmath73 , and @xmath74 the expression for @xmath33 reproduces correctly the gapped bcs - like function for quasiparticles traveling parallel to the magnetic field , while describing gapless behaviour in all other directions . </S>",
    "<S> a similar expression for @xmath33 has been obtained by pesch @xcite . since @xmath32 is a fourier series in @xmath75 , the mode with @xmath76 will couple to a scalar potential , the mode with @xmath77 to a transverse potential etc . </S>",
    "<S> then we find @xmath78    frequency ) . </S>",
    "<S> using this value to determine the correction to anomalous propagator @xmath35 and calculate the current from equation([curr ] ) we obtain the longitudinal and transverse conductivities up to order @xmath79 .    </S>",
    "<S> if we use the usual notation @xmath80 for the normal state conductivity @xmath81 , the enhancement of the transverse current due to lorentz force driven fluctuations of the order parameter @xmath82 is exactly compensated by the modification of the quasiparticle hall current due to additional scattering off the vortex lattice @xmath83 similarly , the positive contribution to the transverse conductivity due to the forces generated by gradient of the excited mode of the order parameter @xmath84 is cancelled by the additional scattering introduced by the deformed and moving vortex lattice @xmath85 as a result , the behaviour of the transverse conductivity @xmath86 is determined solely by the effect of the modification of the effective elastic scattering time @xmath87 on the leading order quasiparticle contribution . for the dc conductivity </S>",
    "<S> this change is due to the decrease in the number of states at the fermi surface available for scattering as the superconducting gap opens . </S>",
    "<S> we find , in agreement with the result of pesch @xcite for the density of states , that the increase in the relaxation time is a non - analytic function of the small parameter @xmath88 @xmath89,\\ ] ] and , up to order @xmath79 the transverse conductivity is given by @xmath90.\\ ] ] the longitudinal conductivity is obtained in a similar way @xmath91.\\ ] ] in the high - field region the square of the order parameter is linear in the applied magnetic field and is given by @xcite @xmath92    in figure 1 we show the qualitative behaviour of @xmath86 as a function of magnetic field , plotted using parameter values for nb . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse conductivity is enhanced below the upper critical field and has negative curvature in the high field region . </S>",
    "<S> while the transverse conductivity is proportional to the square of the scattering time , the hall angle @xmath93 is only linearly dependent on the scattering time and the corresponding nonlinear dependence on magnetic field is weaker , as can be seen in figure 2 . finally , as the transverse resistivity @xmath94 is independent of the effective scattering time , upon entering the superconducting state it remains linear in magnetic field with the same slope as in the normal metal . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is to be contrasted with that of bardeen - stephen model @xcite , where the resistivity is modified but the hall angle obeys the same linear law as in the normal state . on the other hand , the nozieres - vinen theory@xcite , which predicts that the hall angle should be constant in the flux - flow regime below @xmath6 at variance with the result of this work , also finds that the transverse resistivity is identical to that of the normal state , although the individual components of the conductivity tensor are quite different from those found here .    </S>",
    "<S> a comparison can be made with the experimental data of fiory and serin @xcite on high purity nb . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments find a transverse resistivity in the flux - flow regime which is linear in the applied magnetic field over a wide range of fields below @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the hall angle , however , flattens or even increases above its value at @xmath6 before decreasing at lower fields . </S>",
    "<S> these results are more suggestive of the behaviour given here than the original interpretation given in terms of the nozieres - vinen theory . also , the longitudinal resistivity found in @xcite has a distinct increase in slope just below the upper critical field , which is consistent with the logarithmic behaviour given by equation ( [ sxx ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> such comparisons are , of course , only qualitative , and more experimental work is needed to make a detailed comparison with the theory .    to conclude , we give the results of a microscopic calculation of the hall resistivity of a clean type - ii s - state superconductor in the high - field limit . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the field dependence of the hall conductivity in the high field regime , which is non - analytic , is entirely due to the change in the density of quasiparticle states at the fermi level in the superconducting state . at the same time we find that the field dependence of the transverse resistivity below the upper critical field remains unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> the approach developed here can be generalized to superconductors with unconventional order parameter symmetry , this work is now in progress .    </S>",
    "<S> one of us ( a h ) would like to thank a t dorsey , d rainer , and k scharnberg for important discussions . </S>",
