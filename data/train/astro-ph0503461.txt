    "the recently discovered double pulsar system j0737 - 3039 ( burgay 2003 ; lyne 2004 ) presents an unprecedented natural laboratory for testing our understanding of general relativity and pulsar magnetosphere physics .",
    "one of the unique features of this system is the almost edge - on orientation of its orbital plane with respect to our line of sight .",
    "currently the two best constraints on the system s inclination come from the shapiro delay ( @xmath1 ; lyne et al .",
    "2004 ; ransom 2004 ) and from scintillation measurements ( @xmath2 , coles 2004 ) . among other effects",
    "this high inclination leads to periodic eclipses of the millisecond pulsar ( pulsar a ) by plasma in the magnetosphere of the normal pulsar ( pulsar b ) ( see lyne et al .",

    "the edge - on orientation of the system also makes possible gravitational light bending of the pulsar signal when the pulsar passes through its superior conjunction with respect to the companion . in lai & rafikov ( 2005 ) , we studied the effect of gravitational lensing on the pulse intensity and the impact of light bending on the correlated scintillation measurements of both pulsars .",
    "we also evaluated the effects of light bending on the pulse arrival time : geometric time delay and the modified shapiro delay  both of these timing contributions are independent of the pulsar spin .",
    "since pulsar signals are due to the beamed emission of a rotating neutron star ( as opposed to radial pulsation of the star ) , additional spin - dependent time delays arise due to special relativistic aberration ( smarr & blandford 1976 ; damour & deruelle 1986 ) and general relativistic light bending ( cf .",
    "schneider 1990 ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to evaluate these spin - dependent delays in the psr j0737 - 3039 system , and assess their detectability and potential for constraining the parameters of the system .",
    "we also examine the distortion of pulse profile due to aberration and lensing , and discuss an alternative way of analyzing pulse arrival time and introduce the concept of `` latitudinal delay '' that focuses on specific features in the pulse profile . for psr j0737 - 3039",
    ", a measurement of this latitudinal delay may lead to useful constraints on the geometry of the system .",
    "in  [ sect : timing ] , we calculate the spin - dependent time delays due to aberration and lensing . in  3 , we examine the pulse shape distortion / variation and calculate the latitudinal delays .",
    "the prospects of detecting these effects are discussed in  4 .",
    "although the formulae derived in this paper are general for any binary pulsar system , we shall apply them to psr j0737 - 3039 , concentrating on the effects of rotational delays on the timing of the millisecond pulsar a , with pulsar b playing the role of the lensing companion .",
    "we adopt the following parameters for the system : @xmath3 , the spin period of pulsar a @xmath4  ms , the orbital period @xmath5 , the orbital semimajor axis @xmath6 , eccentricity @xmath7 , longitude of periastron @xmath8 ( as of 2004 ) , and the orbital inclination angle @xmath9 in the range between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "because of special relativistic light aberration , the direction of emission in the comoving frame of the pulsar , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , differs from that in the observer s frame , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , by the vector ( ) _ a=(_p ) _",

    "this lensing effect is important only around the superior conjunction of the pulsar , giving rise to potentially measurable time delay provided that the minimum projected separation between the pulsar and its companion is comparable to the companion s einstein radius ( lai & rafikov 2005 ) .",

    "the time delays associated with lensing do not suffer from this degeneracy .",

    ". in particular , if the real inclination angle of j0737 - 3039 is closer to that measured with the shapiro delay ( @xmath85 ) rather than the one inferred using the scintillation technique , then @xmath83 amounts to @xmath86s ( which is at present unmeasurable ) reached @xmath87 s after conjunction , which is almost at the end of eclipse of pulsar a.    the magnitude of @xmath66 scales as @xmath88 and its shape depends on @xmath52 as @xmath89 . as a result , unlike the geometric delay and shapiro delay , the rotational lensing delay is generally _ asymmetric _ with respect to orbital conjunction ( the exception is when @xmath90 ) .",

    "thus , it would in principle be possible to detect variation of @xmath162 ( but not of @xmath163 or @xmath164 ) caused by geodetic precession and longitudinal aberration at a 2@xmath180 level after tens of years of timing observation .",
    "much better measurement can be made if one monitors the long - term drift of timing positions of _ individual _ pulse features instead of the whole profile .",
    "then the amplitude of drift in @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 caused by geodetic precession is augmented by the much more significant latitudinal aberration .",
    "since the latitudinal delay has the same dependence on the orbital elements as the longitudinal one , its effect on variation of @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 can be included by simply changing @xmath181 and @xmath182 in ( [ eq : ae_rel ] ) and ( [ eq : t_rel_long ] ) . as a result , @xmath162 and",
    "@xmath163 determined from timing of individual pulse features vary on geodetic precession timescale with relative amplitude @xmath183",
    ". this should give a highly significant detection of geodetic variation of @xmath162 ( and on a shorter baseline than the longitudinal aberration variation ) and yield a measurement of @xmath163 variation at a @xmath184 level .",
    "the accompanying variation of @xmath164 at the level of @xmath185 ms would still escape detection .",
    "time delays caused by gravitational light bending do not suffer from the degeneracy with roemer delay ( or any other timing contribution ) because of their unique time dependence ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : dtl ] ] , [ [ eq : delt_l_col ] ] , and figs .",
    "[ fig : pos_image]-[fig : neg_image ] ) . as noted before , in general the rotational lensing delay is asymmetric with respect to the conjunction , which may facilitate the separation of this delay from the geometric delay and the ( corrected ) shapiro delay ( lai & rafikov 2005 ) . for the parameters adopted in figure [ fig : pos_image ] ,",
    "the maximum amplitude of @xmath66 for the positive image is @xmath186 ( for @xmath76 or the minimum @xmath187  km ) , while @xmath126 reaches as high as @xmath188 , both achieved within several seconds of conjunction",
    ". the latter delay would be detectable if one times the arrival of individual features of the pulse profile .",
    "detecting the lensing - related time delays may be a challenging task .",
    "one factor which limits the accuracy of pulsar timing arises from the intrinsic variation of the pulse profile from one pulse to the next . if one times the arrival of a pulse feature with width @xmath189 , then the timing accuracy after combining @xmath190 pulses is @xmath191 . for psr j0737 - 3039a",
    ", the pulse has two peaks , each with width @xmath192  ms .",
    "the lensing effect lasts about @xmath193  s , so that in each orbit there are @xmath194 pulses during the lensing event , and about half of them ) where absorption by magnetospheric plasma of pulsar b is important ( kaspi 2004 ; rafikov & goldreich 2004 ) . at the same time , mclaughlin ( 2004 ) and lyutikov & thompson ( 2005 ) have demonstrated that even very close to a s superior conjunction radio signal of a can still pass through b s magnetosphere almost unattenuated at some intervals of b s rotation phase within which at least several rotational periods of a can be detected . it is this penetrating part of a s radio flux that can be used to search for gravitational lensing effects in j0737 - 3039 .",
    "] may be used for timing purposes .",
    "this gives @xmath195  ms for a single passage through conjunction , somewhat larger than the amplitude of @xmath111 ( for @xmath196 ) . by adding up pulses from many orbits",
    "one will obtain better timing accuracy which may make the detection of @xmath111 possible .",
    "this would set a robust constraint on the system s inclination angle .",
    "finally , all rotational effects ( both aberration and lensing ) that we described in application to j0737 - 3039a should also be relevant for j0737 - 3039b . since the masses of the two pulsars are quite similar , the variation of the direction of emission vector @xmath197 is also similar for both pulsars , but the spin period of pulsar b , @xmath198  s is significantly longer than @xmath199 ms . as a result ,",
    "the amplitudes of all spin - dependent delays for pulsar b are @xmath200 higher than for pulsar a. however , the current timing accuracy of pulsar b , @xmath201 ms ( lyne 2004 ) , is much poorer than that of pulsar a and is not expected to improve significantly in the future .",
    "the pulse profile of pulsar b is unstable and subject to variations throughout the orbit , presumably due to the influence of the intense wind / radiation from pulsar a ( ramachandran 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , the spin and magnetic geometry of pulsar b ( not well constrained observationally at present ) may not be very favorable for exhibition of large latitudinal effects .",
    ", the inclination of the spin axis to the orbital angular momentum axis @xmath202 ( lyutikov & thompson 2005 ) . ]",
    "pulse profile distortion associated with the latitudinal aberration delay is the most easily measurable among all rotational timing effects in j0737 - 3039a if the spin - magnetic orientation of this pulsar inferred by demorest ( 2004 ) is correct .",
    "this effect should be detectable with the current timing accuracy if the arrival times of individual pulse components ( rather than the pulse centroid ) are monitored .",
    "however , if this effect is not found in the data , we can suggest two possible reasons .",
    "first , it is conceivable that at the present time the spin orientation is such that @xmath203 , resulting in a rather small profile distortion by aberration ( see eq .  [ [ eq : c_and_d ] ] ) .",
    "this would additionally account for the remarkable stability of j0737 - 3039a pulse profile ( manchester 2005 ) .",
    "however , such a situation would not last since geodetic precession of the pulsar spin axis changes @xmath52 on the timescale of years , so that several years from now latitudinal aberration should become observable .",
    "there is also a possibility that the spin of pulsar a is almost aligned with the orbital angular momentum misalign with the orbital angular momentum axis except if the kick was directed along or close to the orbital plane . ]",
    "which , because of the edge - on orientation of the system , would naturally make @xmath203 .",
    "this requires a very large opening angle of the emission cone , @xmath204 , which may be unlikely .",
    "second , it is possible that the spin and magnetic orientations inferred by demorest ( 2004 ) are incorrect , e.g. because of the failure of rvm",
    ". this would not be very surprising given that the polarization data are corrupted by quasi - orthogonal modes .",
    "even the interpretation of the emission as coming from a single magnetic pole can be called into question . if this were the case , the angles @xmath99 and @xmath50 could be different from what we used in our estimates , possibly reducing the magnitude of pulse distortion .",
    "thus , measuring the pulse variation in j0737 - 3039a on the orbital timescale can be used to probe the emission and spin geometry of pulsar a.    pulse shape variations caused by latitudinal shifts are very promising from the observational point of view : unlike the lensing effects , profile dilation due to orbital aberration does not require special orientation of orbital plane which makes it potentially observable in many binary systems . as far as we are aware , no one has attempted to detect pulse profile expansion / contraction of the predicted form correlated with the phase of pulsar orbital motion .",
    "the only possible exception is the study of psr b1534 + 12 by stairs ( 2004 ) in which pulse shape variations were detected through fitting a linear combination of two standard profiles to all observed profiles .",
    "variation of coefficients of this linear combination on short ( orbital ) and long ( geodetic precession ) timescales allowed stairs to set constraints on the pulsar spin geometry .",
    "this procedure seems to be less straightforward than a direct measurement of the variation of the phase separation between different pulse components that we propose to perform , although it has an advantage of yielding pulsar spin orientation free from assumptions about the beam geometry .",
    "it may be possible to infer the psr j0737 - 3039a spin orientation from rotational effects alone , without resorting to polarimetric observations .",
    "the pulse profile variations on the orbital timescale and the long - term geodetic variations of orbital parameters may be enough to measure a s spin orientation with respect to its magnetic axis ( angle @xmath99 ) and with respect to orbital angular momentum of the binary .",
    "detection of lensing effects would refine the accuracy of such measurement and additionally constrain the inclination of the system , and may also help verify the assumption of circular beam shape .",
    "rotational delays may be measurable in other compact binary pulsar systems with significant @xmath205 .",
    "in such systems pulse profile variations on orbital timescales may be a telltale signature of latitudinal aberration .",
    "the effect is strongest for pulsars in which the polarization angle of radio signal does not exhibit significant variation across the pulse profile , implying small value of @xmath127 and large @xmath104 ( see eq .  [ [ eq : delphi0 ] ] ) .",
    "this could serve as a useful criterion for selecting potential targets to detect orbital pulse profile variations ( geodetic variations will also be enhanced for such pulsars by latitudinal effects , see  [ sect : detect ] ) .",
    "timing of individual pulse components needed for such detection should be facilitated in pulsars with rich pulse profiles exhibiting many symmetric sharp features . using",
    "this technique to measure pulsar orientation with high significance may require stacking together observations obtained in many orbits , but , presumably , this would still require much shorter baseline than is needed for detection of timing variations caused by geodetic precession .",
    "our results on the lensing effects have been obtained in the static approximation , which neglects the change in the orbital configuration of the binary during the time it takes a radio photon emitted by pulsar a to cross the system .",
    "this is the approach adopted by damour & taylor ( 1992 ) and many other authors since then .",
    "recently kopeikin & schfer ( 1999 ) have gone beyond the conventional static approximation and presented ways of including the effect of finite photon propagation time on pulsar timing .",
    "we plan to investigate the influence of this effect on lensing timing signals in the future ( rafikov & lai 2005 ) .",
