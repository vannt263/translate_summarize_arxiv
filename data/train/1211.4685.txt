    "recently a monochromatic photon line at 130 gev has been found in the fermilat data in the vicinity of the galactic center @xcite . a possible explanation for this line can be the annihilation of a dark matter ( dm ) pair of mass 130 gev directly to a photon pair with cross section equal to @xmath7 .",
    "extensive studies have been carried out in the literature to explain this line @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the dm is taken to be either a scalar or a fermion so the annihilation to a photon pair can not take place at a tree level with renormalizable couplings .",
    "if the charged particles propagating in the loop are light enough , their direct production via dm annihilation typically exceeds the bounds @xcite .",
    "however , within vector dark matter ( vdm ) models novel features appear .",
    "such vdm models have recently received attention in the literature @xcite . here",
    ", we show that the vector boson dm candidate has a unique advantage for explaining the 130 photon line because unlike a neutral scalar or spinor , a neutral vector boson can directly couple to photon through a large unsuppressed dimensionless gauge invariant coupling . in this letter , we introduce a simple model that explains the 130 gev line .",
    "the model predicts accessible new signals for the lhc and can explain the slight excess of @xmath8 . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we introduce the model and discuss the direct and indirect dm searches within this model . in sec .",
    "[ excess ] , we compute the contribution to the higgs decay to a photon pair . in sec .",
    "[ lhc ] , we discuss the potential signal at colliders .",
    "results are summarized in sec .",
    "pair to a higgs pair via @xmath9 coupling , width=264 ]    the model adds only a pair of neutral vector bosons @xmath10 and @xmath11 with masses @xmath12 to the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "we impose a @xmath13 symmetry under which only @xmath10 and @xmath11 are odd so @xmath10 is stable and therefore a potentially suitable dark matter candidate . to avoid negative norm modes ,",
    "we take their kinetic terms to be of antisymmetric form : _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath14/4 $ ] where @xmath15 . in a general basis ,",
    "the mass terms are @xmath16 and the dimensionless gauge and @xmath13 invariant couplings to the higgs are @xmath17 without loss of generality we can go to a basis in which @xmath10 and @xmath11 are mass eigenstates with masses @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "notice that in this basis @xmath20 can be nonzero but @xmath21 .",
    "although the @xmath22 couplings are dimensionless , if @xmath23 are not gauge bosons , they will be non - renormalizable @xcite .",
    "we can promote @xmath23 and @xmath24 to gauge bosons of two new @xmath25 gauge symmetries as prescribed in the stckelberg mechanism , by replacing @xmath23 and @xmath24 in these terms as well as in mass terms with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we will work in a gauge that the stckelberg fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 are eaten by the longitudinal components of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "for the purpose of this paper , it is enough to take @xmath22 wilsonian effective couplings below some cutoff @xmath30 .",
    "the new vector boson can have quartic couplings with each other but these couplings are not relevant for our discussion .",
    "notice that @xmath22 should be real to guarantee the hermiticity of the potential ; however , because of the presence of quartic vector boson coupling , we do not know a priori their sign .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath20 couplings give rise to annihilation of to the @xmath10 pair ( see figs 1,2 ) . setting @xmath31 , we find + @xmath32 @xmath33 ^ 2}{m_v^4(m_h^2 - 4m_v^2)^2}\\nonumber\\\\ + 2[1+\\frac{2\\lambda_1 v_h^2}{2m_v^2-m_h^2}+\\frac{3\\tan\\theta_w m_h^2}{2(-4m_v^2+m_h^2)}]^2\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the vacuum expectation value of higgs is denoted by @xmath34 gev .",
    "moreover , like other higgs portal models , the @xmath9 coupling gives rise to the annihilation of the @xmath10 pair via an @xmath35-channel higgs exchange diagram with cross section @xmath36 where @xmath37 can be @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and etc .",
    "@xmath41 is the decay rate of a hypothetical sm - like higgs ( @xmath42 ) with a mass equal to @xmath43 to @xmath37 .",
    "pair to a higgs pair via the @xmath20 coupling , width=264 ]    to account for the observed dark matter abundance within the thermal production scenario @xcite , the total dm pair annihilation cross section should be equal to 1  pb . setting the sum of cross sections of these modes equal to 1  pb and @xmath44  gev , we find @xmath45 .",
    "notice that the total annihilation cross section falls well below the @xmath46 bound from fermi - lat continuum gamma - ray constraint @xcite as well as the bounds from the pamela constraint on the anti - proton flux @xcite .",
    "more data from fermi - lat and ams02 may make it possible to probe the model in future .",
    "the @xmath20 coupling also gives rise to annihilation to a higgs pair via a @xmath47 and @xmath48 channel @xmath11 exchange ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "fixing @xmath49 , we find @xmath50 taking @xmath51  pb , for @xmath49 and @xmath44  gev , we find @xmath52 . notice that for @xmath49 and @xmath53 the required @xmath20 enters the non - perturbative regime .",
    "pair to a photon pair , width=264 ]    the symmetries of the model also allow the presence of the following terms : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the field strength associated with the hypercharge gauge boson : @xmath56 . again",
    "although @xmath57 and * @xmath58 * are dimensionless , if @xmath23 and @xmath24 are not promoted to gauge bosons , these couplings will be non - renormalizable @xcite . again using the stckelberg mechanism ,",
    "these terms can be made gauge invariant .",
    "the @xmath57 coupling is the familiar `` generalized chern - simons '' term @xcite which can arise by integrating out heavy chiral fermions charged both under the hypercharge and the new @xmath25 gauge symmetries .",
    "the * @xmath58",
    "* coupling can be large contrary to the non - decoupling theorem @xcite .",
    "a similar term has also been employed in @xcite to explain the 130 gev line . in the following ,",
    "we study the phenomenology of these two terms .",
    "the @xmath57 and @xmath58 couplings respectively lead to ( see fig .",
    "3 ) @xmath59 in which @xmath60 . for the contribution from the @xmath57 coupling , @xmath61 and for that from the @xmath58 coupling , @xmath62 .",
    "these couplings also induce annihilation to a @xmath63 pair as follows @xmath64 + where @xmath65 + and + @xmath66 in which @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we therefore expect two photon lines : one photon line at @xmath0 and another at @xmath2 with an intensity suppressed by @xmath69<(\\tan^2\\theta_w)=0.3 $ ] irrespective of the ratio @xmath70 .",
    "in fact , the observation favors double line structure over a single line @xcite ; however , more data is required to resolve such a double line feature @xcite . from now on , we take @xmath44 gev and @xmath71 . for @xmath72",
    "gev , this yields @xmath73 for the @xmath57-dominated range and @xmath74 for the @xmath58-dominated range . as long as @xmath75a few tev ,",
    "the required values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 will remain in the perturbative regime .    through the @xmath9 coupling ,",
    "the dark matter interacts with nuclei with cross section of @xmath76 + where @xmath77 is the mass of a nucleon and @xmath78 is the reduced mass for the collision .",
    "@xmath79 parameterizes the nuclear matrix element ( @xmath80 ) @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath81 , we find @xmath82 .",
    "this means under the condition that @xmath9 is the main contributor to the dm annihilation , the present bound from xenon100 @xcite practically rules out @xmath83 .",
    "however for @xmath84 , we do not expect an observable effect in the direct searches .",
    "+ if the mass splitting between @xmath10 and @xmath11 is smaller than @xmath85 , the dm can interact inelastically with the @xmath57 and @xmath58 couplings through a @xmath86-channel photon exchange .",
    "small splitting can be justified by an approximate @xmath87 symmetry .",
    "we do not however consider such a limit so the main interaction will be via the higgs portal channel .",
    "and @xmath88 couplings , width=264 ]    the @xmath9 and @xmath88 couplings contribute to @xmath3 via triangle diagrams within which @xmath10 and @xmath11 propagate ( see fig.4 ) . for the @xmath57 and @xmath58 couplings , the leading - log contribution of @xmath9 to the decay amplitude is @xmath89 where for the @xmath57 contribution @xmath90 while for the @xmath58 contribution , @xmath91 . in both cases , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . replacing @xmath94 and @xmath95",
    ", we obtain the contribution of @xmath88 .",
    "these amplitudes have to be summed up with the sm triangle diagrams within which top quark and @xmath96 boson propagate .",
    "notice that our result is ultra - violet divergent .",
    "this is because @xmath57 and @xmath9 , despite being dimensionless , are non - renormalizable @xcite . for @xmath97 , the contribution of @xmath9 will be comparable to that in the sm . the observed slight excess @xcite can be attributed to this effect .",
    "notice that if the excess is confirmed , the sign of @xmath9 can also be determined .",
    "if further data rules out the excess , a bound on @xmath98 can be derived which for the value of @xmath9 found in previous section ( @xmath81 ) can be interpreted as an upper bound on @xmath30 .",
    "that is the scale of new physics giving rise to the effective @xmath57 coupling can be constrained . in case that @xmath20 is the main contributor to the dark matter annihilation , the effect of @xmath9 can be arbitrarily small .",
    "as discussed , these two possibilities can be distinguished by direct dark matter searches .    with similar diagrams we predict a contribution to @xmath99 .",
    "since in this model the new particles are heavier than @xmath100 , the higgs can not have invisible decay modes .",
    "a pair of @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be produced by the annihilation of a fermion ( @xmath79 ) and antifermion ( @xmath101 ) pair via a @xmath35-channel photon exchange , are effective couplings below @xmath30 .",
    "there is also a subdominant contribution from @xmath102 which can be neglected relative to @xmath103 .",
    "the energy of center in the lep experiment was too low to allow the production of @xmath10 and @xmath11 pair .",
    "however , in the lhc , the @xmath10 and @xmath11 pair can be produced as long as we are in the perturbative regime ; _ i.e. _ , as long as @xmath75few tev .",
    "regardless of the mass range , @xmath11 can decay to a photon and @xmath10 . for @xmath104 and nonzero @xmath57 @xmath105 for @xmath106 and nonzero @xmath107",
    ", @xmath108 has to be replaced with @xmath109 . for both @xmath57 and @xmath58 regimes , the signature of the @xmath110 production at the lhc will therefore be an energetic mono - photon plus missing energy which has only low background @xcite and therefore enjoys a good discovery chance .",
    "there is also a decay mode to @xmath111 suppressed by @xmath112 .",
    "if the kinematics allows @xmath11 can decay to @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 ; however , the decay into @xmath116 will dominate . using the parton distribution functions in @xcite ,",
    "we have calculated @xmath117 and have found that for @xmath118  tev and @xmath119 and for the value of @xmath120 that induces the desired 130 line intensity , @xmath121  fb which seems to be already excluded by the 7 tev run of the lhc @xcite .",
    "thus , for @xmath104 , @xmath122 should be larger than 200  gev . for @xmath123 gev and @xmath124 ,",
    "the cross - section @xmath125 is larger than 50 fb so @xmath122 should be larger than 500  gev . however , to draw a conclusive result a dedicated analysis with customized cuts is necessary .",
    "taking @xmath126 and @xmath127  tev and therefore @xmath128 , we have found @xmath129 .",
    "similarly , for the case of @xmath58 contribution with @xmath130 and @xmath127  tev , we have found @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the lhc can probe almost the whole perturbative regime .",
    "pairs of @xmath132 can be produced via @xmath133 at the lhc .",
    "for @xmath45 , we have found the cross section to be 0.25 fb ( 0.8 fb ) for 8 tev ( 14 tev ) c.o.m energy .",
    "we have presented a model within which dark matter is composed of a new vector boson ( @xmath10 ) of mass 130  gev such that through its annihilation the observed 130 gev photon line from the galaxy center can be explained .",
    "the model also contains another vector boson ( @xmath11 ) which together they can couple to the antisymmetric field strengths of the photon and @xmath1 boson . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ gvs ] ) , two types of couplings are possible . both these couplings",
    "lead to the annihilation of dark matter pair to two monochromatic lines : one line at 130 gev and the other with an intensity suppressed relative to the first one by @xmath134<0.3 $ ] at 114  gev .",
    "thus , by searching for such double line feature the model can be tested .",
    "@xmath11 has to have a mass smaller than a few tev to account for the 130 gev line in the perturbative regime .",
    "the same coupling can also lead to @xmath110 pair production at the lhc which will appear as mono - photon plus missing energy signal . for a given @xmath11 mass ,",
    "the production rate is fixed .",
    "the present data seems to already rule out light @xmath11 .",
    "the entire perturbative region with @xmath135  tev can be probed by the 14  tev run of the lhc so this model is testable with this method , too .    within this model the dark matter pair",
    "mainly annihilates to a higgs pair with a cross section equal to 1  pb to account for the observed dark matter abundance within the thermal dark matter scenario .",
    "this annihilation can take place with either @xmath9 coupling or the @xmath20 coupling defined in eq .",
    "( [ hv ] ) . if @xmath9 is responsible for this annihilation , we expect an observable effect in near future in direct searches for dark matter .",
    "in fact , the present bound on dark matter - nucleon scattering cross section can be accommodated only with small form factor .",
    "@xmath9 can also explain the small excess observed in @xmath136 .",
    "it can also contribute to @xmath137 .",
    "these observations can fix the sign of @xmath9 .",
    "however , if @xmath138 , such effects in the higgs decay as well as direct dark matter searches disappear .",
    "the couplings that lead to dark matter pair annihilation to the higgs pair and @xmath139 pair are all dimensionless . nonetheless ,",
    "if the vector bosons are not gauge bosons , they will be non - renormalizable leading to ultraviolet infinities and violation of unitarity .",
    "thus , these couplings are only effective at low energies . however , as shown in @xcite , the `` generalized chern - simons coupling '' , @xmath58 can be large . using the stckelberg mechanism ,",
    "these vector bosons can be made @xmath25 gauge bosons , removing the cut - off dependence of @xmath140 and violation of unitarity in the @xmath110 production at large center of mass energies .",
    "if further data confirms the existence of the @xmath141 line at 130 gev , our model can provide a testable explanation with rich phenomenology .",
    "if however this line disappears with further data still the model has interesting features worth exploration .",
    "absence of any line would set an upper bound on @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "if a photon line at a different energy appears , our model with @xmath0 equal to the energy of the new line can provide an explanation .",
