    "numerous graphics algorithms have been established to synthesize photorealistic images from 3d models and environmental variables ( lighting and viewpoints ) , commonly known as rendering . at the same time , recent advances in vision algorithms enable computers to gain some form of understanding of objects contained in images , such as classification  @xcite , detection  @xcite , segmentation  @xcite , and caption generation  @xcite , to name a few .",
    "these approaches typically aim to deduce abstract representations from raw image pixels .",
    "however , it has been a long - standing problem for both graphics and vision to automatically synthesize novel images by applying intrinsic transformations ( e.g. , 3d rotation and deformation ) to the subject of an input image . from an artificial intelligence perspective , this can be viewed as answering questions about object appearance when the view angle or illumination is changed , or some action is taken .",
    "these synthesized images may then be perceived by humans in photo editing  @xcite , or evaluated by other machine vision systems , such as the game playing agent with vision - based reinforcement learning  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the problem of predicting transformed appearances of an object when it is rotated in 3d from a single image . in general , this is an ill - posed problem due to the loss of information inherent in projecting a 3d object into the image space .",
    "classic geometry - based approaches either recover a 3d object model from multiple related images , i.e. , multi - view stereo and structure - from - motion , or register a single image of a known object category to its prior 3d model , e.g. , faces  @xcite .",
    "the resulting mesh can be used to re - render the scene from novel viewpoints .",
    "however , having 3d meshes as intermediate representations , these methods are 1 ) limited to particular object categories , 2 ) vulnerable to image alignment mistakes and 3 ) easy to generate artifacts during unseen texture synthesis . to overcome these limitations",
    ", we propose a learning - based approach without explicit 3d model recovery .",
    "having observed rotations of similar 3d objects ( e.g. , faces , chairs , household objects ) , the trained model can both 1 ) better infer the true pose , shape and texture of the object , and 2 ) make plausible assumptions about potentially ambiguous aspects of appearance in novel viewpoints .",
    "thus , the learning algorithm relies on mappings between euclidean image space and underlying nonlinear manifold .",
    "in particular , 3d view synthesis can be cast as pose manifold traversal where a desired rotation can be decomposed into a sequence of small steps .",
    "a major challenge arises due to the long - term dependency among multiple rotation steps ; the key identifying information ( e.g. , shape , texture ) from the original input must be remembered along the entire trajectory .",
    "furthermore , the local rotation at each step must generate the correct result on the data manifold , or subsequent steps will also fail .    closely related to the image generation task considered in this paper",
    "is the problem of 3d invariant recognition , which involves comparing object images from different viewpoints or poses with dramatic changes of appearance .",
    "shepard and metzler in their mental rotation experiments  @xcite found that the time taken for humans to match 3d objects from two different views increased proportionally with the angular rotational difference between them .",
    "it was as if the humans were rotating their mental images at a steady rate .",
    "inspired by this mental rotation phenomenon , we propose a recurrent convolutional encoder - decoder network with action units to model the process of pose manifold traversal .",
    "the network consists of four components : a deep convolutional encoder  @xcite , shared identity units , recurrent pose units with rotation action inputs , and a deep convolutional decoder  @xcite . rather than training the network to model a specific rotation sequence , we provide control signals at each time step instructing the model how to move locally along the pose manifold .",
    "the rotation sequences can be of varying length .",
    "to improve the ease of training , we employed curriculum learning , similar to that used in other sequence prediction problems  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the model should learn how to make one - step @xmath0 rotation before learning how to make a series of such rotations .",
    "the main contributions of this work are summarized as follows .",
    "first , a novel recurrent convolutional encoder - decoder network is developed for learning to apply out - of - plane rotations to human faces and 3d chair models .",
    "second , the learned model can generate realistic rotation trajectories with a control signal supplied at each step by the user .",
    "third , despite only being trained to synthesize images , our model learns discriminative view - invariant features without using class labels .",
    "this weakly - supervised disentangling is especially notable with longer - term prediction .",
    "the transforming autoencoder  @xcite introduces the notion of capsules in deep networks , which tracks both the presence and position of visual features in the input image .",
    "these models can apply affine transformations and 3d rotations to images .",
    "we address a similar task of rendering object appearance undergoing 3d rotations , but we use a convolutional network architecture in lieu of capsules , and incorporate action inputs and recurrent structure to handle repeated rotation steps .",
    "the predictive gating pyramid  @xcite is developed for time - series prediction and can learn image transformations including shifts and rotation over multiple time steps .",
    "our task is related to this time - series prediction , but our formulation includes a control signal , uses disentangled latent features , and uses convolutional encoder and decoder networks to model detailed images .",
    "@xcite proposed a gating network to directly model mental rotation by optimizing transforming distance .",
    "instead of extracting invariant recognition features in one shot , their model learns to perform recognition by exploring a space of relevant transformations .",
    "similarly , our model can explore the space of rotation about an object image by setting the control signal at each time step of our recurrent network .",
    "the problem of training neural networks that generate images is studied in  @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a convolutional network mapping shape , pose and transformation labels to images for generating chairs .",
    "it is able to control these factors of variation and generate high - quality renderings .",
    "we also generate chair renderings in this paper , but our model adds several additional features : a deep encoder network ( so that we can generalize to novel images , rather than only decode ) , distributed representations for appearance and pose , and recurrent structure for long - term prediction .",
    "contemporary to our work , the inverse graphics network ( ign )  @xcite also adds an encoding function to learn graphics codes of images , along with a decoder similar to that in the chair generating network . as in our model",
    ", ign uses a deep convolutional encoder to extract image representations , apply modifications to these , and then re - render .",
    "our model differs in that 1 ) we train a recurrent network to perform _ trajectories _ of multiple transformations , 2 ) we add control signal input at each step , and 3 ) we use deterministic feed - forward training rather than the variational auto - encoder ( vae ) framework  @xcite ( although our approach could be extended to a vae version ) .",
    "a related line of work to ours is disentangling the latent factors of variation that generate natural images .",
    "bilinear models for separating style and content are developed in  @xcite , and are shown to be capable of separating handwriting style and character identity , and also separating face identity and pose .",
    "the disentangling boltzmann machine ( disbm )  @xcite applies this idea to augment the restricted boltzmann machine by partitioning its hidden state into distinct factors of variation and modeling their higher - order interaction .",
    "the multi - view perceptron  @xcite employs a stochastic feedforward network to disentangle the identity and pose factors of face images in order to achieve view - invariant recognition . the encoder network for ign",
    "is also trained to learn a disentangled representation of images by extracting a graphics code for each factor . in  @xcite , the ( potentially unknown ) latent factors of variation are both discovered and disentangled using a novel hidden unit regularizer .",
    "our work is also loosely related to the  deepstereo \" algorithm  @xcite that synthesizes novel views of scenes from multiple images using deep convolutional networks .",
    "in this section we describe our model formulation . given an image of 3d object , our goal is to synthesize its rotated views .",
    "inspired by recent success of convolutional networks ( cnns ) in mapping images to high - level abstract representations  @xcite and synthesizing images from graphics codes  @xcite , we base our model on deep convolutional encoder - decoder networks .",
    "one example network structure is shown in figure  [ fig : layers ] .",
    "the encoder network used @xmath1 convolution - relu layers with stride 2 and 2-pixel padding so that the dimension is halved at each convolution layer , followed by two fully - connected layers . in the bottleneck layer",
    ", we define a group of units to represent the pose ( _ pose units _ ) where the desired transformations can be applied .",
    "the other group of units represent what does not change during transformations , named as _ identity units_. the decoder network is symmetric to the encoder .",
    "to increase dimensionality we use fixed upsampling as in  @xcite .",
    "we found that fixed stride-2 convolution and upsampling worked better than max - pooling and unpooling with switches , because when applying transformations the encoder pooling switches would not in general match the switches produced by the target image .",
    "the desired transformations are reflected by the action units .",
    "we used a 1-of-3 encoding , in which @xmath2 $ ] encoded a clockwise rotation , @xmath3 $ ] encoded a no - op , and @xmath4 $ ] encoded a counter - clockwise rotation .",
    "the triangle indicates a tensor product taking as input the pose units and action units , and producing the transformed pose units .",
    "equivalently , the action unit selects the matrix that transforms the input pose units to the output pose units .",
    "the action units introduce a small linear increment to the pose units , which essentially model the local transformations in the nonlinear pose manifold .",
    "however , in order to achieve longer rotation trajectories , if we simply accumulate the linear increments from the action units ( e.g. , [ 2 0 0 ] for two - step clockwise rotation , the pose units will fall off the manifold resulting in bad predictions . to overcome this problem , we generalize the model to a recurrent neural network , which have been shown to capture long - term dependencies for a wide variety of sequence modeling problems .",
    "in essence , we use recurrent pose units to model the step - by - step pose manifold traversals .",
    "the identity units are shared across all time steps since we assume that all training sequences preserve the identity while only changing the pose .",
    "figure  [ fig : model_rnn ] shows the unrolled version of our rnn model .        [ fig : model_rnn ]    we only perform encoding at the first time step , and all transformations are carried out in the latent space ; i.e. , the model predictions at time step @xmath5 are not fed into the next time step input .",
    "the training objective is based on pixel - wise prediction over all time steps for training sequences : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the sequence of @xmath8 actions , @xmath9 produces the identity features invariant to all the time steps , @xmath10 produces the transformed pose features at time step @xmath5 , @xmath11 is the image decoder producing an image given the output of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the @xmath15-th image , @xmath16 is the @xmath15-th training image target at step @xmath5 .",
    "we trained the network parameters using backpropagation through time and the adam optimization method  @xcite . to effectively train our recurrent network , we found it beneficial to use curriculum learning  @xcite , in which we gradually increase the difficulty of training by increasing the trajectory length .",
    "this appears to be useful for sequence prediction with recurrent networks in other domains as well  @xcite . in section  [ sec",
    ": experiments ] , we show that increasing the training sequence length improves both the model s image prediction performance as well as the pose - invariant recognition performance of identity features . also , longer training sequences force the identity units to better disentangle themselves from the pose .",
    "if the same identity units need to be used to predict both a @xmath0-rotated and a @xmath17-rotated image during training , these units can not pick up pose - related information . in this way , our model can learn disentangled features ( i.e. , identity units can do invariant identity recognition but are not informative of pose , and vice versa ) without explicitly regularizing to achieve this effect .",
    "we did not find it necessary to use gradient clipping .",
    "we carry out experiments to achieve the following objectives .",
    "first , we examine the ability of our model to synthesize high - quality images of both face and complex 3d objects ( chairs ) in a wide range of rotational angles .",
    "second , we evaluate the discriminative performance of disentangled identity units through cross - view object recognition .",
