    "also , the illustrated data were obtained at a saturation parameter of @xmath218 , outside the validity region of the line - profile model that accounts for rf micromotion .",
    "to validate our claim that the fluorescence signal predicted by the 1-d model is a good approximation if the heating rate is assumed to be a strongly decreasing function of @xmath214 , we performed a numerical monte carlo simulation of the fluorescence , based on integrating the optical bloch equations through a large number of cooling trajectories . for each trajectory , we propagate the density matrix @xmath219 of the ion s internal state according to the master equation @xmath220      + 2l \\rho l^\\dag -\\left\\{l^\\dag l , \\rho\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath221 is the lindblad operator for excited state decay and @xmath222 for the @xmath182 and @xmath223 introduced above . coupling to the motional state is modeled by the average light force , @xmath224 .",
    "this model assumes neither the atoms to be weakly bound nor the cooling beam intensity to be low but does neglect recoil heating .",
    "figure [ fig : simulation ] shows the result of fitting simulations with different assumptions for the frequency dependence of the heating to the dataset presented in fig .  [ fig : realdata ] .",
    "we find that if we assume the transverse modes are not heated , we obtain a temperature estimate of @xmath125 , in agreement with the result of fitting the 1-d model to the data , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : realdata ] .",
    "the @xmath1 mode temperature of @xmath215 estimated from the @xmath213 model is close to , and slightly smaller than , this value , and agrees with the temperature estimate of @xmath225 based on extrapolating heating rates measured with the raman sideband technique for the same trap configuration .",
    "this particular form of the frequency dependence of the heating rate was observed for the same trap when the raman sideband technique @xcite was used , and similar frequency dependencies have been observed in other geometries @xcite .",
    "if we instead assume an @xmath226 dependence of the heating , the results only change slightly .",
    "our main conclusions from the simulation results are that the primary effect of the presence of weakly heated spectator modes will be to slow down cooling due to thermalization . if @xmath213 heating of the transverse modes is assumed , the 1-d model will somewhat overestimate the motional temperature of the axial mode .",
    "we consider two modifications to the experimental protocol to reduce the total measurement time . both are motivated by the fact that the size of the signal from a given amount of heating increases with increased initial energy .",
    "one approach would be to coherently add a known amount of energy to the @xmath1 mode at the start of the heating period .",
    "if the added energy is enough to bring the atom into the slow - cooling regime , this will increase the signal change due to a given amount of additional heating , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : offsete ] .    , so that @xmath227 .",
    "the solid line shows the scattering rate as a function of time for an atom which has first been deliberately excited to a motional energy of @xmath228 and then allowed to heat for a duration which added an average thermal energy of @xmath229 .",
    "for comparison , the dash - dotted line shows the signal for an atom experiencing the same heating period without any initial excitation , i.e.  with @xmath230 . in all cases , @xmath203 . ]    alternatively , parametric amplification @xcite could be employed after the heating cycle to modify the thermal distribution .",
    "parametric amplification can be implemented by modulating the @xmath1 trap potential at @xmath231 , and leads to amplification of one quadrature of the motion while damping the other quadrature . for a low value of @xmath110",
    ", parametric amplification would increase the fraction of experiments in which the atom is in the slow - cooling regime at the beginning of the cooling process , thus increasing the signal for a given heating period , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : paramamp ] .     and",
    "@xmath232 respectively at @xmath203 .",
    "the solid and dotted lines show the average scattering rate for the same conditions , except that the motional amplitude has been parametrically amplified by a factor of @xmath233 after the heating period . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the motional energy of a trapped atom or ion can be estimated from the temporal changes in fluorescence observed when doppler cooling is applied .",
    "specifically , the initial energy can be estimated by fitting eq .  , where the mean initial motional energy is the only free variable , to the observed fluorescence .",
    "our analysis assumes the oscillation frequency of the atoms is much smaller than the linewidth of the optical transition used for doppler cooling and the motional energy at the start of the cooling is thermal .",
    "compared to raman sideband transition methods for heating rate measurements , this method is simpler to implement experimentally but requires longer measurement duration for traps with low heating rates . on the other hand , for high heating rates , where sideband cooling is inefficient",
    ", this may be the method of choice .",
    "we have shown that in the typical situation , where the time for heating dominates , the total measurement time decreases with decreasing laser intensity , decreasing laser detuning , and increased heating period duration .",
    "we have compared the trade - off between these parameters ( fig .",
