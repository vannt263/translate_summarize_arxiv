    "one of the outstanding questions in astrophysics is how angular momentum is exchanged in what would otherwise be centrifugally - supported disks so as to permit infall through the disk and accretion onto the central object ( @xmath5 , star or stellar remnant , or a galactic central super - massive black hole ) .",
    "gravitational instabilities @xcite and magneto - rotational instabilities @xcite are often considered to transfer angular momentum and permit infall in the disks .",
    "interferometric observations at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths have revealed an increasing number of circumstellar disks around class i protostars@xcite .",
    "recent observations have also found disks around class 0 protostars @xcite , as well as circumbinary disks around both components of a binary protostellar system @xcite .",
    "mechanisms must operate in these disks so as to permit infall through the disk and accretion onto the central protostar or protostellar system .    here",
    ", we address the forces that may be responsible for driving the exchange of angular momentum in circumbinary disks so as to permit infall through these disks and hence growth of the binary system .",
    "the formation of binary systems is the primary mode of star formation at solar masses @xcite .",
    "one commonly examined mode in which such systems may form is through the fragmentation of a massive , rotating , disk - like structure due to the gravitational instability @xcite ( see the argument by maury et al .",
    "2010 too ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the resulting protostellar system comprises two ( or more ) protostars , each exhibiting a circumstellar disk , surrounded by a rotationally - supported circumbinary disk @xcite .",
    "gravitational torques from the binary protostars exert a non - axisymmetric force on the circumbinary disk , creating most visibly a characteristic two - arm spiral ( in the case of binary systems ) where the local angular momentum in the circumbinary disk is elevated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "infall occurs away from the spiral arms and through the outer lagrangian points of the binary system where the local angular momentum in the circumbinary disk is lowered . until now , however , observations have not had sufficient angular resolution and sensitivity to detect such features in circumbinary disks . here , we report our observation of l1551 ne using the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) designed to test the abovementioned model predictions for its circumbinary disk .    l1551 ne is a class i protostellar system ( @xmath6 = 91 k , @xmath7 = 4.2 @xmath8 ) located in the taurus molecular cloud @xcite at a distance of 140 pc @xcite .",
    "observations with the very large array ( vla ) reveals two 3.6-cm radio continuum sources with a projected separation of @xmath270 au at a position angle of 120@xmath9 : the south - eastern source is referred to as  source a \" and the north - western source  source b \" @xcite .",
    "near - infrared observations of l1551 ne reveal that source a drives collimated [ fe ii ] jets along the northeast to southwest direction , and source b is located at the origin of an extended ( @xmath22000 au ) nir reflection nebula with its symmetry axis at essentially the same position angle as the jets from source a @xcite .",
    "our previous observations of l1551 ne with the submillimeter array ( sma ) in the 0.9-mm continuum , c@xmath0o ( 3 - 2 ) , and @xmath1co ( 3 - 2 ) lines revealed a weakly extended central dust component associated with the two protostellar components identified as their circumstellar disks , surrounded by a ring - like circumbinary disk having an outer radius of @xmath2300 au @xcite .",
    "the major axis of the circumbinary disk is orthogonal to the [ fe ii ] jets from source a and the outflow cavity associated with source b , suggesting that the circumbinary disk is aligned with the circumstellar disks of the binary components .",
    "based on the inferred alignment of both the jets and outflow cavity with respect to the plane of the sky , the near side of the circumbinary disk is to the east and the far side to the west . the gas motion in the circumbinary disk as measured in our sma observations",
    "can be satisfactorily modeled as pure ( circular ) keplerian rotation , from which we derived a total mass for the binary system of @xmath20.8 @xmath10 , as well as an inclination of @xmath1162@xmath9 for the circumbinary disk and a position angle for its major axis of @xmath12167@xmath9 .",
    "based on the projected orbital separations of source a and source b from the inferred kinematic center of the circumbinary disk , we derive a mass ratio for the binary protostars of @xmath13 / @xmath14 @xmath20.19 where @xmath14 and @xmath13 , respectively , denote the masses of sources a and b. our follow - up observations of l1551 ne at lower angular resolutions in the c@xmath0o ( 3 - 2 ) line with the sma revealed that the circumbinary disk is surrounded by an infalling envelope that can be traced out to a radius of @xmath2500 au @xcite .",
    "our observation of l1551 ne with alma were made during the first cycle of regular scientific observations ( cycle 0 ) with this instrument , and like in our sma observations were made in the 0.9-mm dust continuum , c@xmath0o ( @xmath15=3 - 2 ) , and @xmath1co ( @xmath15=3 - 2 ) lines . at a spatial resolution that is 1.6 times higher ( in beam area ) and sensitivity that is @xmath26 times better ( in brightness temperature ) than those attained in our previous sma observations , we are able to detect for the first time internal structures and non - axisymmetric gas motion in the circumbinary disk of l1551 ne . to aid in interpreting the results , we performed a 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of the distribution and motion of matter around a binary protostellar system tailored to the inferred properties of l1551 ne .",

    "the velocity channel maps of the @xmath1co emission are shown in appendix a. a more detailed technical description of how we subtracted keplerian rotational motion from the c@xmath0o image cube can be found in appendix b , and our theoretical modeling in appendix c.",
    "our observation of l1551 ne was performed on 2012 november 18 with alma in its extended configuration during the cycle 0 stage of scientific observations .",
    "table 1 summarizes the observational parameters . during the observation ,",
    "the precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere was stable at a mean value of @xmath20.96 mm . excluding overheads for calibration , the total time on source is 78 minutes .",
    "the minimum projected @xmath16 distance is 16.368 @xmath17 at the c@xmath0o frequency ( 329.3305453 ghz ) , implying that we are able to recover virtually all the flux of the circumbinary disk out to its outermost radial extent of @xmath2300 au @xcite . on the other hand , we are largely insensitive to its surrounding envelope , such that only 10@xmath18 of the peak flux is recoverable for a gaussian emission distribution with a fwhm of 10@xmath19 ( @xmath21400 au ) .    the alma correlator was configured in the frequency division mode ( fdm ) to provide four independent spectral windows , each having a bandwidth of 468.75 mhz .",
    "the individual spectral windows are divided into 3840 channels , with each channel having a width of 122.07 khz .",
    "hanning smoothing was applied to the spectral channels , resulting in a frequency resolution of 244.14 khz and hence a velocity resolution of 0.22 km s@xmath20 at the c@xmath0o ( @xmath15=3 - 2 ) frequency .",
    "with one spectral window dedicated to the c@xmath0o ( 3 - 2 ) line , the remaining three spectral windows were assigned to the @xmath1co ( @xmath15=3 - 2 ; 330.587965 ghz ) , hc@xmath0o@xmath21 ( @xmath15=4 - 3 ; 340.63070 ghz ) , so ( @xmath22=7@xmath23 - 6@xmath24 ; 340.71416 ghz ) , and cs ( @xmath15=7 - 6 ; 342.882857 ghz ) lines .",
    "channels in all four spectral windows devoid of line emission were used to create the continuum image , which has a central frequency of 335.85 ghz (= 0.893 mm ) and a total bandwidth of 1.79 ghz . in this paper , we focus on the results of the continuum and c@xmath0o ( 3 - 2 ) line only because they trace the structure and kinematics of the circumbinary disk most clearly ( we plan to report the full results in the other lines in a separate paper ) . as described below , the newly - found velocity features in c@xmath0o are also seen in the other lines at velocities sufficiently far away from the systemic velocity .",
    "closer to the systemic velocity , the spatial - kinematic structure in the other lines is complicated by the effects of missing flux as well as an outflow ( see appendix a ) .",
    "calibration of the raw visibility data was performed using the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) program as implemented in a standard reduction script for cycle 0 data .",
    "the absolute flux value of the amplitude calibrator , callisto , was derived from the casa butler - jpl - horizons 2010 model , and is accurate to within a systematic flux uncertainty of 10@xmath18 . to create the image cubes in molecular lines",
    ", we applied a fourier transform to the calibrated data to produce an intermediate ( `` dirty '' ) image , and deconvolved from this image the sidelobes of the telescope point spread function to create the final ( `` clean '' ) image .",
    "briggs weighting having a robust parameter of + 0.5 was adopted in the c@xmath0o and @xmath1co images to give the best compromise between spatial resolution and signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the same procedure was adopted for the continuum image , except that we adopted the natural weighting , robust=+0.5 weighting , and the uniform weighting using the data with projected @xmath16 distances larger than 80 @xmath17 ( see figure [ cont ] ) .",
    "the latter imaging is to best emphasize the circumstellar disks and features in the circumbinary disk , and we confirmed that the synthesized beam is still clean with the primary sidelobe level of @xmath225@xmath18 .",
    "figures [ cont]a , b , and c show the 0.9-mm continuum images of l1551 ne at the natural weighting , robust=+0.5 weighting , and the uniform weighting using the data with the projected @xmath16 distances larger than 80 @xmath17 .",
    "these three images demonstrate the circumbinary structures at progressively higher angular resolutions , without missing the primary emission components . in figures [ cont]a and b , a compact component associated with source a , with an emission extension to the location of source b ,",
    "this component most likely traces the circumstellar disks around each binary members .",
    "this circumstellar - disk component is embedded in an extended emission elongated along the northwest to southeast direction , which most likely traces the circumbinary disk . in the highest - resolution ( 0@xmath2572@xmath260@xmath2536 ; p.a.=9.1@xmath9 ) 0.9-mm image shown in figure [ cont]c , the central emission component seen in the lower - resolution images is resolved into two compact components , verifying the presence of the circumstellar disks .",
    "gaussian fits to these two components demonstrate that they are barely if at all resolved .",
    "the south - eastern component has a flux density of 0.35 jy and a centroid location of ( 04@xmath2731@xmath2844@xmath2951 , 18@xmath908@xmath3031@xmath254 ) , and the north - western component a flux density of 0.17 jy and a centroid location of ( 04@xmath2731@xmath2844@xmath2947 , 18@xmath908@xmath3031@xmath256 ) .",
    "the positions of these components are slightly ( @xmath20@xmath253 ) south of the positions of sources a and b derived from previous observations at 3.6 cm that trace free - free emission ( outflows ) from the individual protostars @xcite , but consistent within @xmath310@xmath251 with those measured in our recent observations with the jvla at 7 mm @xcite .",
    "the slight positional shift over the last decade is consistent with the absolute proper motion of the l1551 region found by jones & herbig ( 1979 ) and rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( @xmath32 = 0@xmath25012 yr@xmath20 , @xmath33 = -0@xmath25023 yr@xmath20 ) .",
    "hereafter , we regard the centroid positions of these components as derived from their gaussian fits as the positions of the individual protostars .",
    "in addition to the circumstellar disks , the highest - resolution image reveals , for the first time , brightenings in the circumbinary disk .",
    "the most prominent internal brightenings comprise the @xmath4-shaped feature to the south of the binary system as well as protrusions to the north of source b and north - east of source a. a depression or gap in the dust emission also can be seen between the northern and southern parts of the circumbinary disk and the circumstellar disk of source a.    to better separate the circumstellar disks from the circumbinary disk , we subtracted two gaussian components with parameters derived from the fit to the two compact dust components .",
    "the resultant image is shown in figure [ cont]d , where the southern @xmath4-shaped feature remains evident .",
    "the protrusions to the north of sources a and b can now be seen to comprise another @xmath4-shaped feature , but now located to the north of the binary system .",
    "as we will show below , the northern and southern @xmath4-shaped features correspond to spiral arms ( arms a and b , respectively ) produced by the gravitational torques from the binary stars .",
    "we estimate the masses of the individual circumstellar disks and circumbinary disk ( @xmath34 ) from their individual continuum fluxes ( @xmath35 ) using the relationship @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the frequency , @xmath38 the distance , @xmath39 the planck function for dust at a temperature @xmath40 , and @xmath41 the dust opacity per unit gas + dust mass on the assumption of a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 .",
    "we adopt the relation @xmath41 = @xmath42(@xmath37/@xmath43)@xmath44 , where @xmath45 denotes the dust - opacity index and @xmath46=0.1 @xmath47 g@xmath20 @xcite , as is widely adopted in the literature for circumstellar disks around low - mass protostars .",
    "recent multi - frequency observations of circumstellar disks in dust emission show that @xmath45 is in the range of @xmath20  1 @xcite , and so here we adopt @xmath45=0.5 .",
    "the dust mass opacity at 0.9 mm is then calculated to be @xmath48 = 0.053 @xmath47 g@xmath20 .",
    "this value is a factor 3 higher than that of ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) for grains with thin ice mantles coagulated at a density of 10@xmath49 @xmath50 ( @xmath48 = 0.018 @xmath47 g@xmath20 ) .",
    "thus , adopting the dust mass opacity by ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) provides a factor 3 higher masses of the circumstellar and circumbinary disks . regarding the dust temperature , modeling of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) toward l1551 ne",
    "as measured in single - dish observations at wavelengths from 12 @xmath51 m to 2 mm derived @xmath40 @xmath242 k @xcite .",
    "this temperature is , however , likely to be biased by the optically - thick mid - infrared emission ( @xmath212  100@xmath52 ) , and thus the temperature is more likely the surface temperature of the disk . the dust temperature in the disk midplane of class i sources can be as low as @xmath210 k @xcite . with @xmath40",
    "= 10  42 k and @xmath48 = 0.053 @xmath47 g@xmath20 , a mass for the circumstellar disk of source a is calculated to be @xmath20.005 - 0.044 @xmath10 , that of source b a mass of @xmath20.003 - 0.022 @xmath10 . the flux density of the circumbinary disk in the 0.9 mm continuum as computed from figure [ cont]d is 0.47 jy , corresponding to a mass for the circumbinary disk of @xmath20.007 - 0.059 @xmath10 .",
    "the individual as well as combined disk masses are therefore much smaller than the inferred total binary mass of 0.8 @xmath10 . in our theoretical model for the distribution and dynamics of matter around l1551 ne",
    ", we therefore ignore the self - gravity of the circumstellar disks and circumbinary disk , and only consider the gravitational field of the binary protostars .",
    "figure [ c18omom0s ] shows the c@xmath0o integrated intensity map at an angular resolution of 0@xmath2582@xmath260@xmath2549 ( p.a.=15.9@xmath9 ) ( contours ) superposed on the 0.9-mm dust - continuum map ( colors ; same as that in figure [ cont]d ) of l1551 ne .",
    "the c@xmath0o map in figure [ c18omom0s]a includes an unknown contribution from dust , whereas that in figure [ c18omom0s]b has a constant level subtracted from every channel corresponding to the dust continuum emission as measured outside the velocity range spanned by the c@xmath0o line . the c@xmath0o map before continuum subtraction shows emission from the circumstellar disks , whereas that after subtracting a constant continuum component shows little if any such emission . in the circumstellar disks , both the dust and gas opacities are appreciable , resulting in partial absorption of the line emission by the dust and partial absorption of the continuum emission by the gas . in this situation ,",
    "it is not straightforward to separate the line and continuum emission .",
    "the same complexity is seen , for example , in the circumstellar disk around the t - tauri star hd 142527 @xcite . beyond the circumstellar disks where the dust opacity is significantly lower , the intensity distribution in c@xmath0o is similar irrespective of whether a constant continuum component is subtracted or not .",
    "the circumbinary disk can be traced out to a radius of @xmath2300 au in c@xmath0o , further out than in the dust continuum .",
    "by contrast with the dust continuum map , the c@xmath0o map shows no depression between the circumbinary disk and the circumstellar disk of source a , but instead increases inwards in intensity towards both circumstellar disks .",
    "the observed behavior suggests that c@xmath0o is more optically thick than dust , and that the region between the circumbinary disk and the circumstellar disk of source a is not devoid of matter .",
    "figure [ c18och ] shows the continuum - subtracted velocity channel maps of the c@xmath0o ( 3 - 2 ) line ( contours ) superposed on the 0.9-mm dust - continuum image ( grey scale ) . in our previous observations of l1551 ne with the sma ,",
    "we established that c@xmath0o has a systemic velocity of @xmath53=6.9 km s@xmath20 , and detected this line over the velocity range from @xmath24.3 km s@xmath20 to @xmath29.1 km s@xmath20 @xcite . in our observation here at a higher sensitivity using alma , c@xmath0o can be detected to higher blueshifted velocities of 2.8  4.3 km s@xmath20 and redshifted velocities of 9.0  10.3 km s@xmath20 . as can be seen in figure [ c18och ] , the c@xmath0o emission peaks between sources a and b at blueshifted velocities of 2.8  3.5 km s@xmath20 , and to the southeast of source a at redshifted velocities of 9.9  10.3 km s@xmath20 .",
    "as we will explain later , these high - velocity components likely trace gas in the roche lobes of the two protostars . at blueshifted velocities of 3.7  4.8 km",
    "s@xmath20 the c@xmath0o emission extends northeast from the midpoint between sources a and b , and at redshifted velocities of 8.3  9.7 km s@xmath20 to an area spanning from south to southwest of both sources . at velocities of 5.0  6.1 km s@xmath20 and 7.4  8.1 km s@xmath20 , the c@xmath0o emission originates predominantly from the northern and southern parts , respectively , of the circumbinary disk .",
    "these low - velocity blueshifted and redshifted emissions trace the outer northern and southern parts of the circumbinary disk seen in the 0.9-mm continuum emission , but extends further out that in the continuum .",
    "close to the systemic velocity ( 6.3  7.2 km s@xmath20 ) , the c@xmath0o emission exhibits a `` butterfly '' pattern ( particularly at 6.8 and 7.0 km s@xmath20 ) , a characteristic signature of a keplerian disk @xcite .",
    "the channel maps at velocities relatively close to systemic ( 5.0 - 8.1 km s@xmath20 ) trace the same regions as previously seen in our sma observations , where the spatial - kinematic structure of the circumbinary gas out to a radius of @xmath2300 au was satisfactorily modeled as a keplerian disk . on the other hand , as we shall show , the emission extending to higher blueshifted and redshifted velocities detected here for the first time trace deviations from keplerian rotation .    to help in visualizing the spatial distribution of the newly detected high - velocity components , in figure [ c18och3 ] ( upper panels ) we show maps of the high - velocity ( @xmath542 km s@xmath20 ) blueshifted ( blue contours ) and redshifted ( red contours ) c@xmath0o ( 3 - 2 ) emission superposed on the 0.9-mm dust - continuum image ( grey scale ) .",
    "these high - velocity components also are detected in @xmath1co ( 3 - 2 ) , cs ( 7 - 6 ) , and so ( 7@xmath23 - 6@xmath24 ) ( no emission was detected in hc@xmath0o@xmath21 ) .",
    "for example , in figure [ c18och3 ] ( lower panels ) , we show the corresponding channel maps in @xmath1co ( see the entire velocity channel maps of the @xmath1co emission in appendix a ) . at the highest blueshifted velocities ( left panels ) , both the c@xmath0o and @xmath1co emissions peak between sources a and b. on the other hand , at the highest redshifted velocities ( left panels ) , both the c@xmath0o and @xmath1co emissions peak to the south - east of source a. at slightly lower velocities ( middle panels ) , the blueshifted c@xmath0o and @xmath1co emissions peak to the north from the midpoint between sources a and b and curls northeast , whereas the redshifted c@xmath0o and @xmath1co emissions peak to the southeast of source a and curls to the southwest .",
    "the trajectory of the emission peaks at blueshifted and redshifted velocities follows an @xmath55-shaped curve as highlighted by the yellow curves . at even lower velocities ( right panels )",
    ", the emission in both c@xmath0o and @xmath1co now encompasses the circumbinary disk as traced in the continuum .",
    "figure [ mom1s]a shows the intensity - weighted mean velocity map in c@xmath0o . whereas the velocity field measured in our previous sma observations at a lower angular resolution and sensitivity can be satisfactorily modeled as pure keplerian rotation ( figure [ mom1s]b ) , the velocity field measured in our alma observation shows clear deviations from keplerian rotation .",
    "if the rotation was purely circular , the line - of - sight ( los ) velocity would be symmetric about the major axis of the disk ( tilted vertical dashed lines in figure [ mom1s ] ) and hence the ridge of peak los velocities aligned with the major axis . even in the case of aligned keplerian elliptical orbits",
    ", the ridge of peak los velocities should lie along the straight line for any projection in the sky .",
    "the alma mean - velocity map shows , however , that this ridge deviates from the major axis in a systematic way that can not be explained as either circular or aligned elliptical orbits in a keplerian disk .",
    "in addition , a velocity gradient is apparent along the minor axis of the disk , such that the eastern side of the disk is redshifted and the western side blueshifted . in figure [ mom1s]c , we show the residual mean - velocity map after subtracting the best - fit keplerian model derived from our sma observations ( @xmath56 , figure [ mom1s]b ) from the mean velocity map observed with alma ( figure [ mom1s]a ) .",
    "details of the subtraction process are described in appendix b. for comparison , we overlay the alma 0.9-mm dust continuum image after subtracting the circumstellar disks so as to highlight features in the circumbinary disk ( white contours ) .",
    "the subtracted mean - velocity map shows that , away from the major axis of the circumbinary disk , the los velocities are , in general ( except relatively close to the protostellar system ) , more blueshifted to the north and more redshifted to the south than expected if the rotation was purely keplerian ( and circular ) . along the purple and red curves drawn in figure [ mom1s]c , coinciding with a portion of the individual @xmath4-shaped features seen in the continuum , the los velocities are @xmath540.5 km s@xmath20 more blueshifted and redshifted , respectively , than are expected for pure ( circular ) keplerian rotation . just beyond the protostellar components , the subtracted mean - velocity map shows a patch of residual redshifted velocities to the north and blueshifted velocities to the south .",
    "these patches indicate much lower los velocities than keplerian in the close vicinity of the binary system , implying significant changes in orbital velocities close to and within the roche lobes ( @xmath311.0@xmath19 ; see section 4.1 . ) .",
    "figure [ c18opvs ] ( @xmath57 ) shows the observed position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams of the c@xmath0o emission along the major and minor axes of the circumbinary disk ( n - s and e - w in figure [ c18och3]a ) , as well as along the northern and southern sides of the circumbinary disk parallel to the minor axis ( en - wn and es - ws in figure [ c18och3]a ) . along the major axis of the circumbinary disk ( n - s ) , the observed p - v diagram show primarily keplerian rotation ( green curves from the keplerian model derived in our sma observations ) . along the minor axis passing through the disk center ( e - w ) , however , the p - v diagram is not symmetric as would be expected for keplerian rotation .",
    "instead , the p - v diagram along this axis shows blueshifted emission extending to the highest velocities ( @xmath58 - 2 km s@xmath20 from the systemic velocity ) in the west and redshifted emission extending to the highest velocities ( @xmath59 + 2 km s@xmath20 from the systemic velocity ) in the east .",
    "although the p - v diagram therefore indicates a blueshift to redshift velocity gradient from west to east along the minor axis passing through the disk center , the p - v diagram parallel to the minor axis but to the south of the disk center ( es - ws ) shows that the emission increases in redshifted velocity to the west ( red dashed line ) rather than to the east . in addition , the highest redshifted velocity is located to the west ( arrow ) rather than the east . in the case of circular keplerian rotation ,",
    "the p - v diagrams along the on- and off - center minor axes are symmetric and do not show any velocity gradients @xcite . in the case of a rotating disk exhibiting a radial velocity component due to infall ,",
    "the p - v diagram exhibits a velocity gradient along the minor axis reflecting the infalling motion @xcite , but the sense of the velocity gradient is the same for all p - v diagrams parallel to the minor axis .",
    "thus , the different signs of the velocity gradients along and parallel to the minor axis can not be simply explained by combination of rotation and infall .",
    "thanks to the higher angular resolution and sensitivity afforded by alma , we have been able to detect internal structures in the circumbinary dust disk and deviations from keplerian motion in the circumbinary gas disk of l1551 ne not previously seen in our observations with the sma . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the physical causes of these newly - detected features .",
    "as will become apparent , the explanation for these features provides insights into the mechanisms that drive the exchange of angular momentum in the circumbinary disk of l1551 ne so as to permit infall through this disk .    in the roche potential of binary systems , circumbinary orbits close to the binary system experience strong gravitational torques , and",
    "can not be described by circular or elliptical orbits as those around single stars . instead , torques that impart angular momentum to the circumbinary disk create shocks where matter that gained angular momentum collides supersonically with matter located downstream having less angular momentum .",
    "theoretical simulations show that these shocks form a two - arm spiral pattern that co - rotates with the binary system .",
    "one arm extends from the primary through the l3 lagrangian point in the roche potential , and the other arm from the secondary through the l2 point ( see figure [ modelvel]a ) .",
    "these lagrangian points correspond to locations where circumbinary material flows into the roche lobes of the respective binary components @xcite ; note , however , that infall does not occur along the spiral arms , but rather in regions between the spiral arms as we will explain later .",
    "although the degree of density enhancement and opening angle of the spiral arms depend on the binary parameters and physical conditions ( density and temperature ) in the circumbinary disk , the two - arm spiral density pattern is a generic prediction of all published theoretical models of protobinary systems surrounded by a circumbinary disk @xcite .    to model the internal structure and dynamics of the circumbinary disk in the specific case of l1551 ne",
    ", we performed a hydrodynamic simulation using adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code sfumato @xcite .",
    "the relevant parameters adopted in our simulation are summarized in table 2 .",
    "we assumed that the circumbinary disk ( indeed , all the material beyond the two protostars ) is isothermal at a temperature of 13.5 k , and that its equatorial plane is aligned with the orbital plane of the binary system .",
    "material from the circumbinary disk therefore accretes onto the individual circumstellar disks of the binary protostars along the same plane .",
    "we assumed that the binary system has a circular orbit , and adopted a total mass for the binary of 0.8 @xmath10 , a mass ratio of 0.19 , and a binary orbital separation 145 au as determined from our previous sma observations ( table 2 ) .",

    "the specific angular momentum of the injected gas ( @xmath60 ) is chosen to have a centrifugal radius of 300 au ( @xmath56 , @xmath61=461.5 au km s@xmath20 ) .",
    "this radius corresponds to the outer radius of the circumbinary disk , where the gas motion changes from infall in the surrounding envelope to the keplerian rotation in the circumbinary disk as found in our previous sma observations @xcite .",
    "the choice of specific angular momentum is guided also by the need to reproduce the inner depression in dust emission in the circumbinary disk . as previously shown by bate & bonnell ( 1997 ) ,",
    "the size of the inner depression in the circumbinary disk is dependent on the specific angular momentum of the injected gas .",
    "our previous sma observations show that the mass - infall rate from the surrounding envelope to the circumbinary disk is of the order of @xmath210@xmath62 @xmath63 @xcite . in our model , we assume a density for the injected gas of 1.5 @xmath26 10@xmath64 @xmath50 ( table 2 ) , which give a comparable mass - infall rate from the envelope to the circumbinary disk of 3.3 @xmath26 10@xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "we adopted the simulation result after the @xmath220 orbital periods of the binary ( @xmath24 @xmath26 10@xmath65 @xmath66 ) . by that stage of the simulation",
    ", the gas distribution and kinematics have settled into a quasi - steady state and the circumbinary disk developed spiral arms , but the accreted masses onto the protostellar binaries have not yet changed their individual masses significantly .",
    "having computed the gas and also dust ( by simply assuming a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 ) distribution from our hydrodynamic simulation , we then performed radiative transfer calculations to produce the theoretically - predicted 0.9-mm dust - continuum and c@xmath0o images . to better capture the intensity distribution of both the gas and dust , when computing the radiation transfer we assumed a combination of two power - law temperature distributions centered , respectively , on sources a and b. the parameters of the individual temperature profiles are listed in table 2 .",
    "we first fixed the temperature at a radius of 300 au , the outer radius of the circumbinary disk , to approximately reproduce the observed 0.9-mm continuum and c@xmath0o line intensity peaks in the circumbinary disk .",
    "then , the power - law index of the temperature profile was determined to closely reproduce the observed flux density of the compact continuum component ( circumstellar disk ) associated with each protostar .",
    "the choice of the power - law index is controlled by the circumstellar - disk components , and we confirmed that changing the power - law index within the reasonable value ( 0  0.5 ) does not affect the appearance of the spiral - arm features in the circumbinary disk much , and thus the main points of the present paper . we also note that the use of power - law temperature profiles is in conflict with our model computations which assume that the matter around both protostars is isothermal .",
    "however , the adopted power - law index results in a change in temperature of only a factor of 1.4 through the circumbinary disk ( from 33 k at @xmath6750 au to 23 k at @xmath67300 au ) .",
    "the peak brightness temperatures of the @xmath1co and c@xmath0o image cubes on the northern blueshifted side of the circumbinary disk are 28.9 k and 19.8 k , and those in the southern redshifted side 25.9 k and 24.7 k , respectively . on the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and @xmath68 ( @xmath1co ) / @xmath68 ( c@xmath0o ) = 7.7 @xcite",
    ", the excitation temperatures and optical depths can be estimated from these isotopic lines .",
    "we find , for c@xmath0o , an excitation temperature of @xmath236 k and optical depth of @xmath21.2 at the peak brightness on the northern side , and an excitation temperature of @xmath233 k and optical depth of @xmath23.0 at the peak brightness temperature on the southern side .",
    "thus , the c@xmath0o emission is close to or completely optically thick at the emission peaks , and the derived excitation temperatures at these locations correspond to the gas temperatures at the surface of the circumbinary disk .",
    "more typically , the peak brightness temperature of c@xmath0o in the channel maps range from @xmath215 k to @xmath220 k , suggesting that the c@xmath0o emission is mostly optically thin .",
    "the adopted temperature of 13.5 k in our hydrodynamic simulations is lower than the typical peak brightness temperature measured in c@xmath0o , but may be more representative of the bulk of both the gas and dust in the circumbinary disk that is concentrated close to the midplane as discussed in section 3.1 .",
    "thus , the different temperatures used in our hydrodynamic simulation and in the radiative transfer calculations may not present as severe an internal inconsistency as might appear on first sight . as a check , we confirmed that using a temperature of 25 k does not produce any significant differences in the gas distributions in our hydrodynamic simulations . following the radiative transfer calculations",
    ", we used the casa task `` simobserve '' to create the simulated visibility data for the model images with the same antenna configuration , hour angle coverage , bandwidth and frequency resolution , integration time , and noise level as those of the real alma observation .",
    "we further performed flagging of the simulated data to match the simulated data with the real processed data , and then made simulated theoretical images with the same imaging methods as described in section 2 .",
    "more details of our theoretical simulations are described in appendix b.    figure [ contall]a shows the model continuum image ( @xmath56 , before passing through the alma simulator ) .",
    "this image clearly shows two spiral arms , along with a depression or gap between the spiral arms and the two circumstellar disks .",

    "[ mom1s]d shows a systematic deviation in the peak los velocity away from the major axis of the circumbinary disk .",
    "the ridge in peak los velocities traces an @xmath55-shaped pattern as highlighted by the yellow line in figure [ mom1s]d that is seen also in the velocity field of our alma c@xmath0o map ( figure [ mom1s]a ) .",
    "this deviation results in higher blueshifted los velocities at the north - eastern ( purple curve in figure [ mom1s]c ) and higher redshifted los velocities at the south - western ( red curve ) portions of the circumbinary disk than predicted for keplerian rotation .",
    "these portions of the circumbinary disk correspond , respectively , to the eastern part of arm a and western part of arm b. because the spiral arms are produced by gravitational torques from the binary protostars that impart angular momentum onto matter in the circumbinary disk , the matter along the arms orbits faster than keplerian and expands outward , thus producing a peak in the los velocity ( see figure [ modelvel ] ) .",
    "the east ( blueshifted ) to west ( redshifted ) velocity gradients along the offset minor axes seen in the observed and theoretical p - v diagrams ( figure [ c18opvs ] ) reflect the expanding motion of the arms , since the disk near - side is on the eastern side and the far - side on the western side . on the other hand",
    ", the minor axis of the circumbinary disk axis does not cross the spiral arms , but instead crosses regions where our theoretical model predicts torques largely extract angular momentum from the circumbinary disk ( figure [ modelvel ] ) . here , our theoretical model predicts infall occurs , thus explaining the observed velocity gradient along the minor axis of the circumbinary disk .",
    "as the observed velocities on both sides of center along the minor axis reach @xmath700.5 km s@xmath20 , the infall velocity corresponds to @xmath20.5 km s@xmath20 / @xmath71 @xmath20.6 km s@xmath20 ( where @xmath72 is the inclination of the disk ) .",
    "the inferred infall velocity closely matches that predicted in our model .    in summary , both the @xmath4-shaped dust brightenings in the circumbinary disk of l1551 ne and its velocity field as measured in c@xmath0o",
    "can be explained solely by the effects of gravitational torques from the binary components .",
    "the gravitational torques , rather than magnetic fields or other mechanisms for generating turbulence , constitute the primary driver for exchanging angular momentum in the circumbinary disk so as to permit infall through this disk and hence growth of l1551 ne . in figure [ scheme ] , we present a schematic picture that shows the major features so - far discovered in our study of l1551 ne .",
    "an important and as yet unresolved issue in binary star formation is , once one protostar gains a significantly larger mass than the other , which protostar accretes at a higher rate and what factors determine the mass ratio of the final binary product . at approximately solar masses ,",

    "duquennoy & mayor ( 1991 ) showed that the mean mass ratio of the solar - type stars is @xmath20.4 , and reid & gizis ( 1997 ) found that the mass ratio distribution is approximately flat from @xmath20.1 to 1 .",
    "theoretical simulations have produced conflicting results on whether the primary or secondary protostar accretes at a higher rate , and thus whether the mass ratio of binary systems is driven away from or towards unity .",
    "bate ( 1997 ) , bate & bonnell ( 1997 ) , and bate ( 2000 ) suggest that the secondary protostar accretes at a higher rate because it is located further away from the center of the mass of the binary system , and thus sweeps up more material in its orbit than the primary protostar . on the other hand , numerical simulations by ochi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and hanawa et al .",

    "whereas emission at lower blueshifted and redshifted velocities in the circumbinary disk ( as previously seen with the sma ) primarily trace keplerian rotation , the higher velocity emission exhibits systematic deviations from keplerian motion .",

    "for the purpose of producing more realistic theoretical images , we assumed a power - law temperature distribution of @xmath123 , whereas for simplicity we assumed the gas to be isothermal in the hydrodynamic simulation ( detailed discussion on the assumed temperature is given in section 4.1 . ) .",
    "the assumed dust opacity and c@xmath0o abundance are listed in table 2 .",
    "finally , the theoretical images are passed through the casa task `` simobserve '' to create simulated visibility data , and the simulated visibility data are fourier - transformed and de - convolved to create the simulated images , shown in figures [ mom1s ] , [ c18opvs ] , [ contall ] , and [ modelch ] . in this step",
    ", we replicated the same antenna configuration , observing time and hour angle convergence , data flagging , thermal noise , and imaging parameters as the actual observation and data processing .",

    "<S> the 0.9-mm continuum shows two opposing @xmath4-shaped brightenings in the circumbinary disk , and exhibits a depression between the circumbinary disk and the circumstellar disk of the primary protostar . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular lines trace non - axisymmetric deviations from keplerian rotation in the circumbinary disk at higher velocities relative to the systemic velocity , where our previous sma observations could not detect the lines . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we detect inward motion along the minor axis of the circumbinary disk . </S>",
    "<S> to explain the newly - observed features , we performed a numerical simulation of gas orbits in a roche potential tailored to the inferred properties of l1551 ne . </S>",
    "<S> the observed @xmath4-shaped dust features coincide with locations where gravitational torques from the central binary system are predicted to impart angular momentum to the circumbinary disk , producing shocks and hence density enhancements seen as a pair of spiral arms . </S>",
    "<S> the observed inward gas motion coincides with locations where angular momentum is predicted to be lowered by the gravitational torques . </S>",
    "<S> the good agreement between our observation and model indicates that gravitational torques from the binary stars constitute the primary driver for exchanging angular momentum so as to permit infall through the circumbinary disk of l1551 ne . </S>"
