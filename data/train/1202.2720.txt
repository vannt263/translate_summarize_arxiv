    "we have recently proposed a model for excited states of heavy nuclei involving the coupling of a @xmath2 excitation to a rotor @xcite . an important characteristic of this model is the generation of excited @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 k - bands , at similar excitation energies , as a generic feature .",
    "such triplets of k - bands , have been seen in the light nuclei @xmath60 @xcite , @xmath7 mg @xcite and @xmath8ca @xcite , and there is no obvious reason why they should not also occur in heavier rare - earth and actinide nuclei .",
    "it is difficult to make a conclusive identification of the three predicted k - bands from the calculated excitation energies alone .",
    "their precise ordering depends on the details of the cluster - core interaction and the excitation energy of the @xmath2 core state .",
    "if that interaction is overwhelmingly a quadrupole - quadrupole coupling , with model parameters appropriate to the actinide region , then our previous calculation @xcite has the bands , in order of increasing excitation energy above the ground state band , as @xmath9 , then @xmath0 and finally @xmath2 .",
    "however , even if we restrict ourselves to this simplest form , we are unable to predict the absolute values of the bandhead excitation energies with any confidence because we do not know the true strength of the non - central part of the cluster - core interaction .    since @xmath0",
    "beta and @xmath2 gamma bands are a generic feature of the spectra of heavy nuclei , at about 1 mev above the ground state , we have chosen our interaction strength so as to place the excited k - bands in this region .",
    "the value required to do this is not particularly large and indicates an intermediate strength , rather than a truly strong coupling regime .",
    "nevertheless , the suggestion that our calculated @xmath0 and @xmath2 bands might be identifiable with the beta and gamma bands needs to be confirmed or refuted .",
    "an obvious form of confirmation would be that an accompanying @xmath1 band should be detected in the same region of excitation energies as the other two .",
    "tell tale signs of such a band would include the discovery of a @xmath1 state ( the bandhead ) and also pairs of odd - j states ( members of the proposed @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands ) at similar excitation energies .",
    "however , as pointed out previously @xcite , the population of the @xmath1 bandhead is likely to be experimentally difficult .",
    "in addition , the intermediate strength interaction leads us to predict a staggering of the energies of the states in the @xmath1 band , which would make it unclear that they belong in a common band from casual comparison of their excitation energies , even if they were successfully populated .",
    "( this feature of staggering is common to the @xmath1 bands of @xmath60 @xcite , @xmath7 mg @xcite and @xmath8ca @xcite , as well as to the @xmath10 band of @xmath5u @xcite . )",
    "hence , additional information such as predicted electromagnetic transition strengths within and between the proposed band members is needed to enable experimental groups to recognise the states of the @xmath1 band if they do succeed in exciting them .    here , we seek to improve on our previous rough indications of where strong e2 transitions should be expected by calculating in - band and cross - band reduced b(e2 ) and b(m1 ) transition strengths for the ground and excited @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 k - bands in far greater detail .",
    "we can not provide a definitive and unambiguous account of the e2 and m1 transitions because not only does their direction depend on the details of the ordering of the states in the spectrum , but also the wave functions are sensitive to how close in energy the states they represent lie .",
    "subject to these provisos , this paper presents a detailed account of the calculated e2 and m1 transition strengths appropriate to the states generated previously @xcite which should be of considerable assistance to experimental groups searching for the predicted triplet of k - bands .",
    "theoretical studies of positive parity bands in the actinide nuclei including calculation of some electromagnetic transition rates ( but generally only in - band rather than cross - band ) have also been presented within the cranked rpa @xcite , the collective model @xcite , the interacting boson approximation @xcite , the variable moment of inertia model @xcite and the alpha particle cluster model @xcite .    in the next section we briefly outline the structure model leading to the generation of k - bands .",
    "then , we calculate reduced b(e2 ) and b(m1 ) electromagnetic transition strengths within and between these k - bands .",
    "insofar as possible , we compare our calculated b(e2 ) strengths with experimental values for some isotopes of th and u. finally we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we model a nucleus ( @xmath11,@xmath12 ) as a core ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) and a cluster ( @xmath15,@xmath16 ) interacting via a deep , local potential @xmath17 consisting of nuclear and coulomb terms @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , where @xmath20 is the separation of their centres .",
    "we parametrise the nuclear term as @xcite : @xmath21 }   \\nonumber \\\\\\ & + & { 1-x \\over [ 1+\\exp{((r - r_0)/3a ) } ] ^3 } \\biggr \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and take @xmath19 to represent a cluster point charge interacting with a uniformly charged spherical core of radius @xmath22 . if the cluster and core were both restricted to their @xmath0 ground states a single band of states would be produced by solving the schrdinger equation with this potential for a fixed value of the global quantum number @xmath23 ( @xmath24 the number of internal nodes in the radial wave function and @xmath25 the orbital angular momentum ) .",
    "the value of @xmath26 must be chosen large enough to satisfy the major requirements of the pauli exclusion principle by excluding the cluster nucleons from states occupied by the core nucleons .",
    "this can be achieved in the actinide region by taking @xmath27 .",
    "this programme leads to a band of states @xmath28 and excitation energies @xmath29 .",
    "the situation becomes a little more complicated if we accept the possibility of the core being in either its ground state or an excited state having spin - parity @xmath30 ( we restrict attention to @xmath2 excitations here ) and excitation energy @xmath31 .",
    "the cluster - core potential may now contain non - central terms and the system must be described in terms of coupled basis states @xmath32 formed by combining the core spin @xmath33 with the relative orbital angular momentum @xmath25 to obtain a total angular momentum @xmath34 .",
    "the simplest form of non - central potential compatible with considerations of time reversal and parity invariance is a quadrupole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "the matrix elements of such a non - central potential between our coupled basis states are @xmath35 where @xmath36 etc . by combining these with the diagonal elements of the cluster - core rotational motion , simplified to @xmath37 , and the core excitation energy , zero for @xmath38 and @xmath31 for @xmath39 , and assuming that all the radial integrals can be parametrised by a single strength @xmath40 we can obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors by diagonalization of low - dimensional matrices .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectrum resulting from such a calculation using the parameters of ref.@xcite , where more details of the calculation are given .",
    "we calculate reduced b(e2 ) and b(m1 ) electromagnetic transition strengths appropriate to the spectrum shown in fig.1 .",
    "the general features of these results are expected to be common to all those nuclei for which the triplet of k - bands produced by coupling a @xmath2 excitation to a rotor is an appropriate description of part of the spectrum .",
    "there should be strong in - band e2 transitions ( typically a few hundred weisskopf units in the actinide region ) , related to one another rather closely by clebsch - gordan coefficients , and usually much weaker cross - band e2 transitions of typically a few weisskopf units ( although there turn out to be a few interesting exceptions to this general statement ) .",
    "magnetic dipole transitions are possible between some of the levels due to mixing of the relative motion @xmath25-values ( e.g. the @xmath41 states are a mixture of @xmath42 while the @xmath2 states contain mixtures of @xmath43 as well as @xmath44 ) which allow a transition to take place between certain components of these states without changing @xmath25 or @xmath33 .",
    "these b(m1 ) strengths should be rather small , typically 0.01 weisskopf units , but the simple existence of such transitions between @xmath0 and @xmath1 states , where e2 transitions are impossible , can provide a strong indication of our proposed band structure .",
    "the precise details of the transition rates will vary from nucleus to nucleus .",
    "accidental near - degeneracy of excited states in a particular nucleus can lead to exceptionally large mixing with accompanying strong e2 transition strengths .",
    "it must also be borne in mind that any given real nucleus may have some of the predicted levels in a different order from those exhibited in fig.1 so that the transitions go in the opposite direction . indeed",
    ", the excited bandhead ordering may differ from that shown in fig.1 . even then",
    ", our results can still be useful because it is straightforward to transform the calculated strength for @xmath45 into a corresponding value for @xmath46 on multiplication by @xmath47 .    to maintain generality as far as possible we give the calculated b(e2 ) transition strengths as ratios to the value for b(e2 ; @xmath48 ) in the ground state band .",
    "however , we give the b(m1 ) strength estimates directly in weisskopf units because they only depend on the z / a ratios ( which are all very similar in the actinide region ) with the appropriate weisskopf unit independent of the charge and mass of the nucleus in question .      in the limit of strong coupling",
    "there would be no cross - band e2 transitions at all , and the in - band transitions would be given by ( see for example ref.@xcite ) @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the constant intrinsic electric quadrupole transition strength .",
    "we have checked that by increasing the strength of our quadrupole - quadrupole interaction to very large values this situation does indeed emerge from our calculation .",
    "even with a much reduced interaction strength , eq.(3 ) still provides a reasonable zeroth order approximation to the calculated in - band reduced e2 transition strengths , as can be seen from table 1 . the stretched e2 transitions between states with @xmath34 differing by 2 are uniformly strong and much more prominent than most of the transitions between states whose @xmath34 values differ by 1 .",
    "this simple distinction does not hold at low spins where many states lie close together in energy and consequently their wave functions are thoroughly mixed .",
    "there we see equally strong @xmath51 and @xmath52 transitions within the @xmath9 band and @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 transitions in the @xmath55 band .",
    "the general pattern of strong @xmath56 and much weaker @xmath57 transitions reasserts itself at higher values of @xmath34 as state mixing gradually decreases and individual states become more widely separated in energy .    in view of",
    "the staggering of energy levels predicted for the @xmath9 band , this general preference for stretched e2 transitions could easily lead to the perception that the @xmath9 band consists of two separate bands with angular momentum sequences @xmath58 and @xmath59 such that their common origin is not apparent .",
    "see also fig.3 of ref.@xcite .",
    ".calculated in - band reduced e2 strengths b(e2 ; @xmath45 ) for @xmath60 and @xmath2 bands in heavy nuclei .",
    "values are given as ratios relative to the strength of the @xmath48 transition in the ground state band .",
    "see text for details . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the allocation of two separate beta bands worries us and probably warrants further investigation .",
    "there appear to be associated @xmath0 band heads at 927.21 and 997.23 kev for these proposed beta bands , although this latter state s @xmath61 value is based on an e0 transition to the ground state .",
    "however , we also note that there is a @xmath41 state at 1105.71 kev ( assigned to the gamma band ) and a ( @xmath41 ) state at 1059.66 kev .",
    "the appearance of two @xmath41 states , close in energy , is a signature of our three excited k - band model , with the two @xmath41 states belonging to the excited @xmath9 and @xmath2 bands .",
    "we therefore compare the measured reduced e2 transition strengths to our calculated ones by accepting the evaluator s identification of the ground state band , the gamma band and the lower of the two beta bands ( i.e. the one based on a @xmath0 band head at 927.21 and containing the @xmath2(966.13 ) state ) .",
    "we treat the decays from the @xmath2(1037.25 ) state as if that state were a member of our @xmath9 band .",
    "this interpretation places the ordering of the experimental bands as @xmath62 and @xmath2 . since this differs from the ordering in our generic spectrum , shown in fig.1",
    ", we expect that our calculation would need some fine - tuning to yield a good description of @xmath5u .",
    "nevertheless , table 5 compares the experimental cross - band reduced e2 strengths with the values calculated for our `` typical '' actinide nucleus .",
    "the level of agreement for transition strengths into the ground state band from the beta and gamma bands is good , but our calculated values from the proposed @xmath1 band are too large by a factor 36 .",
    "this is about as good as we could expect without fitting the model parameters specifically to @xmath5u properties .",
    "we leave the higher @xmath2 states in abeyance for the present time .",
    "our model could accommodate ( many ) higher lying @xmath2 states if we introduced a @xmath2 cluster excitation in addition to the @xmath2 core excitation . in fact , this cluster excitation could combine with the core excitation to form a total excitation `` spin '' value of @xmath63 , 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 with associated k - bands running from k=0 to @xmath64 in each case . indeed , this extra excitation would introduce several extra beta bands . in this context",
    "it is worth bearing in mind that a multiplicity of beta bands can be produced by a microscopic particle - hole description of the excitations of the system .",
    "this point has been successfully made by chasman in his studies of @xmath65u @xcite , and his conclusions are likely to hold across all nuclei discussed in the present paper .",
    "consideration of a structure model where a cluster rotates around a core having a @xmath0 ground state and an excited @xmath2 state , leads to a spectrum containing a ground state @xmath66 band and three excited bands having @xmath67 and @xmath2 .",
    "these features are observed in light nuclei such as @xmath6o @xcite , @xmath7 mg @xcite and @xmath8ca @xcite , and there is no obvious reason why they should not be replicated in heavier nuclei .",
    "we are unable to predict the energies of the excited bandheads but are tempted to identify the excited @xmath66 and @xmath2 bands with the widespread beta and gamma bands .",
    "we therefore choose the free parameters of our model to place the excited bands in the vicinity of the beta and gamma bands in actinide nuclei .",
    "this gives the generic spectrum for heavy nuclei shown in fig.1 , although we accept that the details , and even the precise band orderings , could change with moderate fine - tuning of the model parameters .",
    "the @xmath9 band has not been widely seen in heavy nuclei , although tables 4 and 5 tentatively indicate its presence in @xmath3th , @xmath4th and @xmath5u .",
    "however , our model suggests that it ought to be a feature common to many more heavy nuclei .",
    "the irregularly spaced state energies emerging from our intermediate strength coupling calculation for this band indicate that it will be a difficult task to identify it on the basis of @xmath61 state excitation energies alone . to this end , we have presented a calculation of the reduced e2 and m1 electromagnetic transition strengths between the states of the spectrum of fig.1 .",
    "of course , only the gross features and not the details should be sought in any particular nucleus , since the b(e2 ) and b(m1 ) strengths will probably be even more sensitive to fine - tuning of the model parameters than the spectrum . nevertheless , these transition rate predictions differ sufficiently from those of the strong coupling limit of the standard collective rotational model @xcite that they suggest a realistic possibility of identifying the elusive @xmath9 band and differentiating between that model and our own .",
    "the in - band e2 transitions of both models are very similar , and related to each other by angular momentum coupling coefficients .",
    "the cross - band e2 transitions are very different . a combination of state mixing due to our intermediate strength non - central interaction and the effects of including a @xmath2 excited core lead to small but measurable cross - band transitions of typically a few wu in our model .",
    "these transitions are absent from the strong coupling limit of the rotational model .",
    "we also predict small m1 transitions of typically a few hundredths of a wu .",
    "the significance of the m1 transitions is mainly that they allow the presence of gamma rays connecting the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bandheads , where otherwise there would be nothing .",
    "our examination of the existing data in the actinide nuclei is tantalising but not conclusive .",
    "the first comment we make is that there are surprisingly few well measured cross - band e2 transition strengths in these nuclei . despite this , there are some indications of the cross band e2 electromagnetic transitions predicted by our model in @xmath3th , @xmath4th , @xmath68u and @xmath5u .",
    "we have considered all reported b(e2 ) strengths in these four nuclei . in three of them",
    "there are certainly excited states , not accommodated in beta and gamma bands , that decay into the ground state band with strengths of a few wu , in line with our model expectations .",
    "we also give a reasonable description of cross - band e2 transitions from the beta and gamma bands in all four nuclei . the only blemish being that the predicted decays from the @xmath2 state of the beta band to the @xmath0 ground state are generally too small .    in the near future",
    "we hope to apply our model in the rare - earth region , where qualitatively similar results are expected .",
    "we also urge our experimental colleagues to reexamine existing data and initiate new experiments to improve the overall level of spectroscopy in the actinide region and , in particular , to verify or deny the existence of the proposed @xmath9 band which is a key distinguishing characteristic of our model .      99 b.buck , a.c.merchant and s.m.perez , phys . rev . *",
