    "the wetting and layering transitions of magnetic ising systems have been studied by several authors . a simple lattice gas model with layering transitions and critical points has been introduced and studied in the mean field approximation by de oliveira and griffiths [ 1 ] , pandit _ et al . _ [ 2 ] , nightingale _ et al . _",
    "[ 3 ] and ebner _",
    "[ 4 - 7 ] .",
    "a variation of phase diagrams with the strength of the substrate potential in lattice gas model for multi - layer adsorption has been studied , using monte carlo simulations , by patrykiejew _",
    "[ 8 ] , and binder and landau [ 9 ] .",
    "one type of transitions is the layering transitions , in which the thickness of a solid film increases discontinuously by one layer as the pressure is increased .",
    "such transitions have been observed in a variety of systems including for example @xmath16 [ 10,11 ] and ethylene [ 12,13 ] adsorbed on graphite .",
    "+ ebner [ 14 ] carried out monte carlo simulations of such a lattice gas model .",
    "huse [ 15 ] applied renormalization group technique to this model .",
    "it allowed the study of the effects on an atomic scale or order disorder transitions in the adsorbed layers , which may have considerable influence on the layering transitions and tracing back macroscopic phenomena on inter - atomic potentials .",
    "benyoussef and ez - zahraouy have studied the layering transitions of ising model thin films using a real space renormalization group [ 16 ] , and transfer matrix methods [ 17 ] . as for the film system , which is finite in one direction",
    ", it has been established that its magnetic properties can differ greatly from those of the corresponding bulk [ 18 - 22 ] .",
    "experimental results [ 23 ] showed that the critical temperature of a vanadium film depends on the film thickness and its critical behaviour is like that of the two - dimensional system rather than that of the three - dimensional bulk . although the great number of theoretical works made in the field of wetting phenomena , especially the effect of the nature of the substrate potential on wetting and layering transitions [ 1,2,16,17,24,25 ] , the relation between the surface coupling and the wetting temperature is not yet sufficiently investigated . however , hong [ 26 ] has studied the effect of the surface couplings on the behaviour of the critical temperature film as a function of its thickness .",
    "+ our aim in this paper is to study the effect of the surface coupling ( different than the bulk one ) on the behaviour of the layering transition and the wetting transition temperatures , as a function of the film thickness of a spin@xmath3 ising film , using the mean field theory .",
    "+ however , depending on the value of the surface coupling @xmath0 , the layering transition temperature @xmath1 can increase or decrease with the film thickness and reaches the wetting temperature @xmath14 when @xmath15 ) for a sufficiently thick film .",
    "furthermore , it is found that there exists a critical value @xmath17 of the surface magnetic field below which the wetting temperature is independent on the surface coupling @xmath0 , while for @xmath5 greater than @xmath17 the wetting temperature depends on the @xmath0 values .",
    "such results can be useful for experiments .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the model and the method . in section 3",
    "we present results and discussions .",
    "we consider a film formed with n coupled ferromagnetic square layers @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is considered as a surface ) infinite in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions , in an external and surface magnetic fields , as it is illustrated by fig . @xmath22 .",
    "+ it is well known that the spin@xmath3 variable values can be written as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 . for simplicity we assume , hereafter , that @xmath25 . hence , the hamiltonian governing the system is given by : @xmath26 the first sum runs over all nearest - neighbour sites .",
    "in several previous works [ 16,17,24,25 ] , the case of a constant coupling @xmath27constant has been studied . here , we consider the model where the constant couplings are given by : @xmath28 in the last sum of the hamiltonian @xmath29 , the total magnetic field @xmath30 is applied on each site @xmath31 , and distributed according to : + @xmath32 with @xmath33 being a positive constant . in all the following",
    ", we will be limited to a constant surface magnetic field @xmath34 applied only on the surface @xmath35 .",
    "this is the case for @xmath36 .",
    "+ the results of the model for a finite @xmath33 value exhibits similar topologies of the phase diagrams as it was outlined by binder _",
    "[ 27,28 ] and in some of our earlier works [ 16,17,29 ] .",
    "+ using the mean field theory , we introduce the effective hamitonian @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , the sum runs over the nearest - neighbour sites @xmath39 of the site @xmath40 .",
    "the magnetization of each site @xmath41 is given by : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 means the trace performed over all spin configurations . since the system is invariant by translation in both @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions , @xmath44 for each site i of the layer k. hence , the magnetisation of a layer @xmath45 can be written as : @xmath46 with the free boundary conditions : @xmath47 .",
    "+ the total free energy of the system can be written as follows @xmath48 where @xmath49 stands for : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the absolute temperature and @xmath54 the boltzmann constant .",
    "reduced values of the parameters @xmath53 , @xmath1 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath5 and @xmath0 are investigated in this work . however , for simplicity the syntax `` reduced '' will be cancelled despite the fact that we use the notations @xmath57 and give numerical values of these reduced parameters .",
    "+ the notation @xmath58 will be used for a configuration where the first top @xmath45 layers from the surface , are in the state up and the remaining @xmath59 bottom layers are in the state down. in particular , @xmath60 ( rep .",
    "@xmath61 ) will denote a system where all the layers are with positive magnetisation ( rep .",
    "negative magnetisation ) .",
    "there exists @xmath62 possible configurations for a film formed with @xmath2 layers .",
    "however , the transition of the layer `` @xmath45 '' is characterised by the change of the sign of its magnetisation while the magnetisations of the remaining @xmath59 layers of the film keep their initial sign i.e. : @xmath63 . hence , for @xmath19 the transition",
    "is called the surface transition .",
    "+ the ground state phase diagram @xmath64 do not depend on the surface coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "hence , in the following we will give results and phase diagrams for @xmath65 .",
    "we solve numerically the equations @xmath66 and @xmath67 in order to establish the phase diagrams of the system .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "@xmath68 shows that the layering transition temperature @xmath69 , defined as the temperature above which the layers @xmath70 of the film begin to transit layer - by - layer , which is usually greater than the `` surface transition '' temperature . except the special case of a film formed with two layers , where the surface transition temperature is close to the layering transition temperature @xmath69 .",
    "it is understood that the wetting temperature @xmath71 coincides with the limit of @xmath72 for a sufficiently thick film @xmath73 .",
    "+ a numerical study of the layering transition temperature as a function of the film thickens is illustrated by figs .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 for two surface magnetic field values and selected values of the surface coupling constant .",
    "it is shown that for a smaller value of the surface magnetic field , the wetting temperature keeps a constant value ( @xmath76 for @xmath77 ) at any surface coupling constant values , as it is shown in fig . @xmath74 . for a higher value of the surface magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "@xmath75 ) , the scenario is inverted and the layering transition temperature @xmath78 ( as well as the wetting temperature ) depends strongly on the surface coupling values .",
    "indeed , for a fixed value of the surface magnetic field @xmath79 , some wetting temperature values are : @xmath80 for a small value of the surface coupling constant @xmath81 and @xmath82 for a higher value @xmath83 , as it is summarized in fig . @xmath75 .",
    "+ nevertheless , there exists three classes of the layering transition temperature behaviours , namely : the behaviour @xmath9 is a situation where the layering transition temperature @xmath72 increases with the film thickness and stabilises at a certain fixed value .",
    "this behaviour is always seen for small values of the surface coupling and any surface magnetic field value .",
    "the behaviour @xmath11 , where @xmath72 increases until a certain film thickness above which it decreases exhibiting a maximum .",
    "this situation is found for medium values of both the surface coupling and the surface magnetic field .",
    "finally the behaviour @xmath84 , where @xmath72 decreases continuously and stabilises at a value close to @xmath85 .",
    "this is generally the case for higher values of surface coupling .",
    "+ it is worth to note that the wetting temperature @xmath85 ( which coincides with @xmath72 for a sufficiently thick film ) decreases as @xmath86 increases at a fixed surface coupling constant @xmath87 .",
    "this is because the surface region becomes magnetically harder than the deeper layers , and as the film is thicker , the strength of the internal magnetic field decreases leading to a decrease of @xmath85 .",
    "+ we found two critical surface coupling constants @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath88 separates the behaviours @xmath9 and @xmath11 , while @xmath89 separates the behaviours @xmath11 and @xmath84 .",
    "the dependency of these critical parameters , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , as a function of surface magnetic field is plotted in fig . @xmath90 . for small values of the surface magnetic field @xmath86 , the constants @xmath88 and @xmath89 become similar and are close to the value @xmath91 , and vanish as the surface magnetic field @xmath86 increases .",
    "+ the results of the figs .",
    "3(a , b ) are summarised in fig .",
    "@xmath90 , since for small values of surface magnetic field @xmath86 the three behaviours of @xmath72 , namely @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath84 are found in this figure , when increasing the surface coupling @xmath87 values .",
    "+ the two critical surface coupling constants @xmath88 and @xmath89 correspond , respectively , to two critical surface magnetic fields @xmath92 and @xmath93 separating the three regimes of the @xmath72 behaviours . for sufficiently large values of @xmath87 ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath72 decreases when increasing the film thickness @xmath2 for any values of @xmath86 . while , for @xmath95 , the layering transition temperature @xmath72 exhibits the three behaviours : ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) depending on the @xmath86 value .",
    "in particular for @xmath96 , @xmath72 is always decreasing when the film thickness increases , see figs .",
    "it is also interesting to examine the surface coupling effect on the layering transition temperature , for a fixed surface magnetic field value . as it is illustrated in fig .",
    "@xmath97 , for a film size @xmath98 layers and several surface magnetic field values , the layering transition temperature increases for small values of @xmath86 and decreases when @xmath86 reaches higher values .",
    "this figure shows also that the layering transition temperature decreases when increasing the surface magnetic field @xmath86 , for a fixed value of the surface coupling @xmath87 .",
    "this result was already outlined in earlier works e.g. pandit _ et al . _",
    "[ 2 ] and in some of our recent works [ 24,25 ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the effect of the surface coupling @xmath0 on the wetting and layering transition temperatures as a function of the thickness @xmath2 , of a spin@xmath3 ising film , using mean field theory .",
    "we showed the existence of a critical value ( @xmath4 ) of the surface coupling constant @xmath0 , above which the layering transition temperature @xmath1 decreases when the film thickness increases for any values of the surface magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "while , for @xmath6 , there exists three distinct behaviours , namely : @xmath9 for @xmath10 , @xmath1 increases with @xmath2 ; @xmath11 for @xmath12 , @xmath1 increases for thin films , and decreases for thick ones ; ( iii ) while for @xmath13 , @xmath1 decreases with increasing the film thickness .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath99 the wetting temperature @xmath14 when @xmath15 ) , is independent on @xmath0 . while for @xmath6 @xmath55 depends on the value of @xmath0 . such result may be useful for experiments . + * references *    1 .   m. j. de oliveira and r. b. griffiths , surf .",
