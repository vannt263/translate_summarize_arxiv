    "in the study of physics , the stability criteria of a system or configuration is one of the main interesting aspects .",
    "unstable system or configurations are generally not realizable in nature and they are generally an intermediate stage in the dynamical evolution of a system . a black hole system in general relativity can also be put in the above mentioned category : the question one asks there is whether a black hole which is stable under some perturbation , i.e. if we perturb the black hole from outside , whether it comes back to its original state after some time or whether the perturbation grows unbound making the black hole unstable .",
    "the study of black hole perturbations remains an extremely intriguing topic which has enormous effect on various important properties of a black hole @xcite .",
    "in general , the dynamical evolution of perturbations of a black hole background can be classified into three stages , the first of which consists of an initial outburst of wave , depending completely on the initial perturbing field , the second stage consists of damped oscillations , known in the literature as the quasinormal modes ( qnm ) whose frequency turns out to be a complex number , the real part representing the oscillation frequency and the imaginary part representing damping .",
    "qn frequencies completely depend on the background and not on the field which is causing the perturbation and thereby giving immense importance to these modes which are used to determine the black hole parameters ( mass , charge and angular momentum ) .",
    "the third is a power law tail behaviour at very late times .",
    "the equations governing the black hole perturbations in most of the cases can be cast into a schrdinger like wave equation .",
    "the qnms are solutions to the wave equation with complex frequencies with a boundary condition which are completely ingoing at the horizon and purely outgoing at asymptotic infinity . with the first ever detection of the gravitational wave @xcite",
    "the interest in studying black hole perturbations has gained another peak .",
    "apart from the fact that the qn frequencies contain important information about the black hole parameters , they were also found to be important from the point of view of ads / cft correspondence .",
    "it has been found that qnms in ads space - time appear naturally in the description of the dual conformal field theory on the boundary @xcite , thereby directing the study of qnms towards ads black holes @xcite .",
    "although the qnms are classical in origin , they have been shown to provide glimpses to quantum nature of black holes @xcite . however , in the present work we will be focussing on the second of the above three stages of evolution of black hole perturbation in a regular black hole background in asymptotically de sitter space - time .",
    "the importance of studying black holes in de sitter space lies in the fact that our universe looks like asymptotically de sitter at very early and late times .",
    "recent observational data also indicates that our universe is going through a phase of accelerated expansion @xcite , thereby providing the existence of a positive cosmological constant",
    ". in general de sitter space turns out to be a maximally symmetric solution to the vacuum einstein equations with a positive cosmological constant . just like the ads / cft correspondence",
    ", a holographic ds / cft duality exists between gravity in de sitter space and conformal field theory on the boundary in one less dimension @xcite .",
    "coming back to the perturbations and stability of black holes in de sitter space , there have been a lot of work @xcite-@xcite on quasinormal modes of scalar , electromagnetic , gravitational , dirac perturbations , decay of charged fields , asymptotic quasinormal modes , and signature of quantum gravity etc . on another front",
    ", it is well known that general relativity is plagued with the appearance of singularities .",
    "the problem of avoiding the singularities in general relativity , therefore , is one of the most fundamental ones and it is a very old problem . in this regard ,",
    "`` regular black hole '' solutions play a central role .",
    "when a black hole does not have a space - time singularity at the origin , it is termed as a `` regular black hole '' in the literature .",
    "the first solution of such regular black holes with non - singular geometry satisfying the weak energy condition were obtained by bardeen @xcite , which is now known as the bardeen black hole .",
    "however , the solution bardeen proposed lacked physical motivation because the solution was not a vacuum solution , rather gravity was modified by introducing some form of matter and thereby introducing an energy momentum tensor in the einstein s equation .",
    "the introduction of the energy - momentum tensor was done in an _ ad hoc _ manner . much later , ayn - beato and garca @xcite showed the energy momentum tensor to be the gravitational field of some magnetic monopole arising out of a specific form of non - linear electrodynamics .",
    "subsequently , many other solutions @xcite-@xcite , motivating the avoidance of singularity was proposed in the literature .",
    "there were many works published regarding such regular black holes : stability properties @xcite , qnms @xcite , thermodynamics @xcite and geodesic structure @xcite of regular black holes to mention a few . very recently",
    "fernando @xcite has proposed a de sitter branch for the regular bardeen black hole and calculated the grey body factor for such a black hole . in this paper",
    ", we will be discussing the qnms of the bardeen de sitter ( henceforth bds ) black hole due to scalar ( both massless and massive ) and dirac perturbations . although study of scalar field perturbations in a black hole background and its corresponding qnms is not new , the dirac field perturbations , on the other hand , are relatively less studied . therefore , apart from the scalar perturbations , it will also be interesting to study the dirac perturbations in the regular black hole backgrounds in de sitter space .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next section we briefly discuss the bds black hole . in section 3",
    "we present a brief discussion of wkb method along with a study of the scalar qnms of the bds black holes .",
    "section 4 deals with the dirac quasinormal modes of the bds black hole .",
    "finally , in section 5 we conclude the paper with a brief discussion on future directions .",
    "in this section , we will briefly discuss the bardeen de sitter ( bds ) black hole following the works of fernando @xcite .",
    "the author of this paper modified the works of @xcite to incorporate a positive cosmological constant in the action : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the ricci scalar and @xmath2 is function of the field strength tensor of the non - linear electrodynamics @xmath3 and its form is given by @xmath4 in the above , the parameter @xmath5 is related to the magnetic charge and the mass of the black hole in the following manner : @xmath6 . if one derives the equations of motion from the above action([action ] ) , then following equations will be arrived at @xmath7 it was shown in @xcite that a static spherically symmetric solution for the above set of equations exist : @xmath8 with @xmath9 being given @xmath10 the solution of @xmath11 gives the horizon and in the particular case of bds black hole there may be three real roots implying three horizons : the black hole inner and outer horizons along with the cosmological horizon .",
    "there lies the possibility of getting either one real root corresponding to cosmological horizon only for a set of parameters of this theory or a possibility of getting degenerate roots corresponding to a merger of the inner and outer black hole horizons for a range of parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "structurally the bds black hole is similar to the reissner - nordstrm - de sitter ( rnds ) or born - infeld de sitter ( bids ) black holes which also admits a possibility of three distinct horizons as well as a single or degenerate horizons .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that the event horizon is larger in the case of rnds black hole compared to a bds one",
    ". the interesting nature of bds geometry is its non - singular structure everywhere .",
    "it can be checked by direct calculation that all the scalar curvatures @xmath1 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are finite everywhere except for the electromagnetic field invariant @xmath16 which is singular at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "in this section we will consider the massless and massive scalar field perturbations of the bds black hole geometry to study the behaviour of the qnms in bds background with the given black hole parameters .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , bds background metric is given by equations ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ fr ] ) .",
    "the klein - gordon equation for a massless scalar field @xmath18 is @xmath19 which explicitly takes the form @xmath20 as usual , we introduce the ansatz for @xmath18 as , @xmath21 with the above ansatz , we have the standard schrdinger - like wave equation for the perturbation of the bds metric by a scalar field is given by @xmath22 where , @xmath23 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath24 is the standard tortoise coordinate related to radial coordinate @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "the advantage of using the tortoise coordinate lies in the fact that the range of the coordinate now extends between @xmath27 to @xmath28 , whereas in the old radial coordinate @xmath25 , the physically accessible region lies between the black hole and cosmological horizon .",
    "note also that the potential @xmath29 as @xmath30 .",
    "it can be easily seen by plotting the scalar field potential against the radial coordinate ( ) for various values of the multipole number @xmath31 that the @xmath32 mode has a distinct local minimum between the black hole outer horizon and the cosmological horizon ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , which was also pointed out in @xcite . for this reason , the method used in this paper to evaluate the qnms for the bds black hole ,",
    "namely , the wkb approach is not a valid one to evaluate qnms for @xmath32 modes .",
    "therefore , from now on , we will only talk about @xmath33 modes for the massless scalar qnms of bds black hole .",
    "as already stated , we will solve the wave equation for complex qn frequencies semi - analytically , using the sixth order wkb method developed in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown extensively in literature that wkb method works extremely well for determining qn frequencies .",
    "the sixth order wkb method is more accurate than the third order method and the former in fact gives results practically coinciding with those obtained from full numerical integration of the wave equation @xcite for low overtones , i.e. for modes with small imaginary parts , and for all multipole numbers @xmath34 .",
    "the sixth order formula for a general black hole potential @xmath35 is mentioned below @xmath36 where @xmath37 is peak value of @xmath35 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the value of the radial coordinate corresponding to the maximum of the potential @xmath35 and @xmath40 is the overtone number .",
    "qn frequencies @xmath41 would be of the form @xmath42 . in equation([qnmeqn ] ) , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are given by @xcite @xmath45\\\\   \\lambda_3=&\\frac{(n+\\frac{1}{2})}{2v^{''}(r_0)}\\big[\\frac{5}{6912 } \\left ( \\frac{v_0^{(3)}}{v^{''}(r_0 ) } \\right)^4(77 + 188b^2)\\nonumber\\\\   & -\\frac{1}{384 } \\left ( \\frac{(v_0^{(3)})^2 v_0^{(4)}}{(v^{''}(r_0))^3}\\right ) ( 51 + 100b^2)\\nonumber\\\\   & + \\frac{1}{2304}\\left ( \\frac{v_0^{(4)}}{v^{''}(r_0)}\\right)^2(67 + 68b^2)\\nonumber\\\\   & + \\frac{1}{288}\\left(\\frac{v_0^{(3)}v_0^{(5)}}{(v^{''}(r_0))^2}\\right)(19 + 28b^2)\\nonumber\\\\   & -\\frac{1}{288 } \\left(\\frac{v_0^{(6)}}{v^{''}(r_0)}\\right)(5 + 4b^2)\\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the above expression @xmath46 , @xmath47 at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be found in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the above method also works extremely well in the eikonal limit of large @xmath31 corresponding to large quality factor , which will also be discussed in the paper . using eqn ( [ qnmeqn ] ) , we computed the qnms and in we plotted re @xmath41 and magnitude of i m @xmath41 vs black hole mass .",
    "both re @xmath41 and i m @xmath41 decreases when mass @xmath52 is increased .                            in table",
    "i , we list the values of the qn frequencies obtained by using third order and sixth order wkb approach for the parameter range @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the data from the table suggests that the value of the real part of the frequency shows a steady increase over its third order outcome but on the other hand , the negative imaginary part obtained using sixth order wkb method shows a steady decline when compared to the third order result .",

    "it is worth mentioning here that by computing the lyapunov exponent ( the inverse of the instability timescale associated with the geodesic motion ) , one can show that , in the eikonal limit , qnms of black holes in any dimensions are determined by the parameters of the circular null geodesics @xcite .",

    "the same argument can be applied in case of bds black holes too in the limit of near - extremal nariai or cold black holes where either the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon merges or the inner and outer horizon coincides . in these limits , it may be possible to get the eikonal limit using the wkb method following @xcite .      for massive scalar perturbation the klein gordon equation",

    ", we expect similar behaviour for bds black hole that the imaginary part of the quasinormal modes frequencies will decrease for large @xmath62 .",

    "we have plotted all the data obtained by 3rd , 4th , 5th and 6th order wkb calculations simultaneously to compare the accuracy between different orders .",
    "we observed from the plots of both im(@xmath41 ) and re(@xmath41 ) that for low overtone number @xmath40 , the accuracy between lower and higher order wkb is not much significant but for large @xmath40 deviation is more .",
    "indeed , the magnitude of im(@xmath41 ) decreases with increasing scalar mass as expected , on the contrary , the magnitude of re(@xmath41 ) increases with increasing field mass .    in table",
    "ii , we present the numerical values of qn frequencies with corresponding parameters . since it is well known that wkb method is more accurate for @xmath71 , we have tabulated the qnms frequencies for @xmath71 only .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ ii ]                    as in massless case , we plot in and the behaviour of qn frequencies with @xmath13 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath72 respectively .",
    "re(@xmath41 ) increases with increasing value of magnetic charge @xmath56 while magnitude of im(@xmath41 ) decreases .",
    "this behaviour of qnms can be well understood from the form of the potential . as the height of the potential peak increases with @xmath56 , therefore real part of qnms increases .    on the other hand",
    ", shows that re(@xmath41 ) decreases with an increase in cosmological constant(@xmath13 ) but im(@xmath41 ) increases with @xmath13 in magnitude .",
    "similarly if we plot the variation of potential with @xmath13 the height decreases , thus i m ( @xmath41 ) increases .",
    "hence , we can say for scalar field perturbations with the scalar mass included , the oscillations decay faster with large cosmological constant @xmath13 and oscillates better for large magnetic charge @xmath56 .",
    "in this section , we will extend our discussion to massless dirac perturbations for bds black holes . as in @xcite , by starting from dirac equation in spherically symmetric curved background , the schrdinger - like equation we finally arrived at is given by @xmath73 where @xmath24 is the tortoise coordinate given by @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the energy .",
    "the effective potentials is given by @xmath76 it is worth mentioning here that the potentials @xmath77 and @xmath78 corresponding to dirac particles and anti - particles are supersymmetric to each other and derived from the same superpotential @xmath79 .",
    "we will evaluate the quasinormal modes by solving equation [ [ sc1 ] ] taking only @xmath77 as it is well known that both dirac particles and anti - particles have the same quasi - normal spectra @xcite .    in",
    ", we showed the behaviour of the effective potential ( @xmath77 only ) for bds black hole with spherical harmonic @xmath70 for parameters @xmath80    ) vs @xmath25 for different values of @xmath31 for the massless dirac perturbations , width=226 ]    we have computed the massless fermion qnms semi - analytically using sixth order wkb method.the plots are shown below . in , we showed the variation of real and imaginary part of @xmath41 with cosmological constant @xmath13 and in , the variation with magnetic charge @xmath56 for different values of @xmath31 with fixed overtone number are shown .",
    "we can clearly see from the plots that re(@xmath41 ) slowly increases with an increase in the magnetic charge @xmath56 of the bds black hole whereas it slowly decreases with increasing value of @xmath13 . whereas the behaviour of the imaginary part of the frequency reverses its role , i.e. as we increase the cosmological constant , the imaginary part increases , however , it decreases if we increase the magnetic charge , keeping all other parameters fixed .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the massless and massive scalar field perturbations and the massless fermionic perturbations for a regular bds black hole .",
    "we have used sixth order wkb approximation method to calculate the qnms frequencies .",
    "we studied how the frequencies vary as a function of the scalar field mass ( @xmath62 ) , multipole number ( @xmath31 ) as well as with the parameters like the cosmological constant ( @xmath13 ) , black hole mass ( @xmath52 ) and magnetic charge ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "we found that the qn frequencies decrease with an increase in black hole mass @xcite .",
    "the plots of frequencies versus the scalar mass show that re @xmath41 increases with mass @xmath62 while i m @xmath41 decreases .",
    "the figures also suggested that if we plot the frequencies from low to higher overtones taking into account different wkb orders , we see that comparative accuracy is better for @xmath81 .",
    "we also found that re @xmath41 decreases with an increase in cosmological constant @xmath13 for scalar ( both massless and massive ) perturbations as well as with dirac perturbations but i m @xmath41 decreases in massless and fermionic case however , increases for the massive case when @xmath13 is increased .",
    "we have also studied the behaviour of how the q - factor for the massless scalar field varies with @xmath13 and @xmath56 .    for massive scalar perturbations ,",
    "we see that mass @xmath62 enhances the field oscillations and decreases the damping for small @xmath13 , unlike in the massless case where it is just the opposite . in all the three scenarios",
    "real frequency of oscillations re @xmath41 increases steadily with magnetic charge ( @xmath56 ) but the damping denoted by i m @xmath41 decreases .    for future directions , it would be interesting to study the time evolution of perturbations for this particular black hole .",
    "apart from that , in @xcite , the authors have used the conformal properties of the spinor field to obtain the dirac qnms for a higher dimensional schwarzschild - tangherlini black hole .",
    "they have described these modes in the light of the so - called split fermion models , where quarks and leptons exist on different branes in order to keep proton stability .",
    "such split fermion theories also have massive fermions in the bulk and it will be interesting to study such massive dirac perturbations in the context of higher - dimensional generalization of the bds black holes .",
