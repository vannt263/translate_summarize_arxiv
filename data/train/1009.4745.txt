    "@xmath6co(10 ) , @xmath6co(21 ) and @xmath6co(32 ) surveys reveal massive molecular clouds to the north east ( ne ) and to the south ( s ) of the snr @xcite .",
    "most of the co emission appears centred at a local standard of rest velocity similar to that inferred for w28 @xmath87(or @xmath9kpc ) based on studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite has argued that w28 has disrupted much of this co gas , giving rise to its relatively broad velocity distribution .",
    "notably , the ne region contains a rich concentration of 1720mhz oh masers @xcite ( with in the range 5 to 15 ) , and near - ir rovibrational h@xmath3 emission @xcite , all indicating shocked gas which likely results from a snr shock interaction with the ne molecular cloud .",
    "the southern region contains several regions ( g6.225 - 0.569 , g6.1 - 0.6 ) including the ultra - compact ( uc)-region w28  a2 ( g5.89 - 0.39 ) , all indicating high - mass star formation .",
    "additional snrs have also been catalogued towards the w28 region , namely , g6.67 - 0.42 by @xcite , and g5.71 - 0.08 by @xcite .",

    "interestingly , a recently detected 1720mhz oh maser @xcite towards g5.71 - 0.08 , with @xmath10 , may also suggest hess  j1800 - 240c is tracing a snr / molecular cloud interaction . at lower angular resolution ( @xmath85 to 20  arcmin ) , two _",

    "this , coupled with the old - age of w28 , which would reduce any potential gamma - ray emission from accelerated electrons , suggests the gamma - ray emission results from collisions of cosmic - ray ( cr ) protons and nuclei with the molecular gas @xcite .",
    "w28 is a prominent member of a growing list of snrs linked to tev / gev gamma - ray emission spatially matched with molecular clouds .",
    "this list includes hess  j1745 - 290/snr  g359.1 - 0.5 @xcite , hess  j1714 - 385/ctb  37a @xcite , hess  j1923 + 141/snr  g49.2 - 0.7 @xcite , and ic  443 @xcite .",
    "all of these snrs exhibit 1720mhz oh masers as for w28 , and appear to be mature snrs ( age @xmath11yr ) whereby any accelerated crs would have begun to escape into the surrounding interstellar medium .    in the w28 field ,",
    "the obvious source of crs is the w28 snr given its prominence in many wavebands , but the other snrs in the region , all with unknown distances and ages , may contribute to cr acceleration .",
    "moreover , the extensive star formation and regions associated with the southern molecular clouds , in particular the energetic uc - region g5.89 - 0.39 may also contribute crs based on recent discussion of protostellar particle acceleration @xcite . some insight into where crs are coming from",
    "can be obtained by looking at cloud density and emission line profiles in order to trace the presence and directionality of shocks .",
    "additionally , @xcite showed that the energy and magnetic field dependent diffusion of crs can lead to a hardening of the tev gamma - ray emission spectrum as one looks inward towards dense molecular cloud cores ( which typically span scale of a few arcminutes ) .",
    "thus , spatial knowledge of molecular cloud density structures and cores towards tev gamma - ray sources is a key step in probing the long sought - after diffusion properties of crs .",
    "since the abundant @xmath6co molecular cloud tracer , with critical hydrogen density @xmath123 , rapidly becomes optically thick towards molecular cloud clumps and cores , understanding of molecular cloud density profiles and internal dynamics can be impaired .",
    "ideal tracers of dense gas such as nh@xmath0 ( ammonia ) , cs , and hc@xmath0n are widely used due to their lower abundance ( a factor @xmath13co ) and higher critical densities @xmath143 , which gives them a much lower optical thickness in dense gas .",
    "nh@xmath0 is exceptionally useful since a single receiver at 23 - 25ghz can detect a large number of nh@xmath0 inversion transitions which are produced over a narrow bandwidth . through satellite and hyperfine structure",
    ", these inversion transitions also allow the optical depth , and hence gas temperature and mass to be strongly constrained .",
    "another desirable property of nh@xmath0 is that the different inversion transitions cover a wide range of excitation conditions .",
    "nh@xmath0 has therefore been detected in many astrophysical environments such as dense quiescent / cold gas and both warm to hot gas in low and high mass star formation regions .",
    "indeed , virtually any region containing dense molecular material can be studied with an appropriate nh@xmath0 transition @xcite .",
    "nh@xmath0 is also known to exist in the coldest regions of molecular clouds depleting less rapidly from the gas phase compared to other common gas tracers , such as co , which tends to freeze out onto dust grains @xcite .    as the next step in probing the dense cores and dynamics of the w28 field molecular clouds ,",
    "we have used the mopra 22 m single dish radio telescope in a 12 mm survey and single position - switched pointing covering the key inversion transitions of nh@xmath0 and several other 12 mm lines tracing high - mass star formation including h@xmath3o masers , hc@xmath1n and ch@xmath1oh .",
    "observations were carried out on the mopra radio telescope in may / june of 2008 and april of 2009 employing the mopra spectrometer ( mops ) in zoom - mode .",
    "mopra is a 22 m single - dish radio telescope ( @xmath15s , @xmath16e , 866 m a.s.l . )",
    "located @xmath8450 km north west of sydney , australia .",
    "the 12 mm receiver operating in the frequency range of 16 - 27.5ghz , coupled with the unsw mopra wide - bandwidth spectrometer ( mops ) , allows an instantaneous 8ghz bandwidth .",
    "this gives mopra the ability to cover most of the 12 mm band and simultaneously observe many spectral lines .",
    "the zoom - mode of mops allows observations from up to 16 windows simultaneously , where each window is 137.5mhz wide and contains 4096 channels in each of two polarisations . at 12 mm",
    "this gives mops an effective bandwidth of @xmath81800 with resolution @xmath80.41 . within this band",
    "the mopra beam fwhm varies from 2.4@xmath17 ( 19ghz ) to 1.7@xmath17 ( 27ghz ) @xcite .",

    "data were reduced using the atnf packages  livedata ,  gridzilla ,  asap and miriad .",
    "for mapping , livedata was used to perform a bandpass calibration for each row , using the preceding off scan as a reference and applied a 1@xmath24 order polynomial fit ( i.e. linear ) to the baseline .",
    "gridzilla re - gridded and combined all data from all mapping scans onto a single data cube with pixels 15@xmath250.43(@xmath26 ) .",

    "a hanning smoothing in velocity ( width @xmath86 ) was applied to reduce random fluctuations , and then the galactic latitude axis was flattened into a single layer . in this way we show the intrinsic velocity location and width of the gas without confusion .",
    "based on the pv maps , it is clear that much of the nh@xmath1 emission is found in the velocity range @xmath8 - 5 to @xmath820 which is quite consistent with the molecular gas found in co studies @xcite towards the w28 region .",

    "nh@xmath0(6,6 ) is detected towards core  2 and triple  core  central , while a weak detection of ( 9,9 ) is seen towards core  2 ( see online figures for spectral plots ) .",
    "such transitions are evidence of high gas temperature and potential disruption .",
    "core  2 is exceptional in that it represents the well - known ne w28 snr shock and molecular cloud interaction region as traced by broad co emission and 1720mhz oh masers towards hess  j1801 - 233 .",

    "an evolutionary sequence for masers associated with high mass star formation regions has been suggested .",
    "this evolutionary sequence suggests that the presence of h@xmath36o masers occurs between @xmath81.5 to @xmath39yr after high - mass star formation , encompassing the onset of an initial or hypercompact ( hc ) region forming @xmath82@xmath40yr after the high - mass star formation .",
    "the radio recombination lines trace ionised gas which often exhibit very broad line widths as a result of likely pressure broadening and turbulence associated with ionised gas .",
    "the lines we see are no exception to this with several reaching line widths @xmath41extending to @xmath42 in the triple  core  central and se regions .",
    "interestingly , the rrl emission appears to be extended and thus may allow probing of the extent to which ionisation is occuring within the southern , central molecular cloud .",

    "finally , core  6 also lies just outside the tev emission from hess  j1800 - 240c and thus is unlikely to be associated . for a 0.2pc radius ,",

    "additional counterparts to core  4a are the ir source , iras17588 - 2358 , also clearly visible in the _ spitzer _ image ( figure  [ fig : irdata ] ) , and a 1612mhz oh maser @xcite .",
    "our detection of hc@xmath0n(32 ) towards core  4a may also suggest it is at an earlier evolutionary stage than core  4 . assuming a 0.2pc radius we derived a mass and density of 75 to 200m@xmath139 and @xmath15945 to 100@xmath158@xmath160 for core  4a and core  4 respectively . despite the reasonable amount of clumpy molecular gas traced by nanten co observations ( e.g. @xmath161m@xmath139 from @xmath6co(10 ) @xcite assuming a 2  kpc distance )",
    ", we see no clear indication for extended nh@xmath1 emission towards this region .",
    "we note however this region has only half the mopra exposure compared to the other regions due to the lack of hops overlap .",
    "_ * triple core and core  5 * _    the triple  core represents the most complex of the regions we mapped , and comprises three nh@xmath1 peaks aligned in a se to nw direction all of which are generally centred on the tev gamma - ray source hess  j1800 - 240b and the very ir - bright and energetic region g5.89 - 0.39 .",
    "our 12 mm observations are the largest scale mapping in dense molecular gas tracers so far of this enigmatic region .",
    "g5.89 - 0.39 actually comprises two active star formation sites and following the nomenclature of @xcite they are labeled g5.89 - 0.39a to the east , and g5.89 - 0.39b about 2@xmath17 to the west . the triple  core  sw nh@xmath1 core is associated with core g5.89 - 0.39a , otherwise known as w28-a2 after its strong radio continuum emission .",
    "the ring - like features prominently visible in the _ spitzer _",
    "8@xmath47 m emission ( see figure  [ fig : irdata ] ) are centred on g5.89 - 0.39a suggesting strong pah molecular excitation from stellar photons .",
    "the triple  core  central nh@xmath1 core is associated with the uc - region g5.89 - 0.39b from which strong h76@xmath37 rrl appears to be centred @xcite signalling strong ionisation of the surrounding molecular gas .",
    "the rrl h62@xmath37 , h65@xmath37 and h69@xmath37 emission from our observations also appears prominent towards g5.89 - 0.39b although in all three lines the emission is elongated towards g5.89 - 0.39a .",
    "the strongest h@xmath3o maser is also seen towards g5.89 - 0.39b .",
    "from the position - switched observations , strong h@xmath36o maser emission with complex structures spanning very wide velocity coverage over 100 are detected towards g5.89 - 0.39a and 60 in g5.89 - 0.39b .",
    "g5.89 - 0.39b is responsible for very energetic outflows and is extensively studied in many molecular lines over arcsec to arcmin scales .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "previous small - scale nh@xmath1 studies are discussed by @xcite .",
    "the triple  core  nw nh@xmath1 core is found a further 5@xmath17 distant and may be linked to the m spectral type pulsating star v5561sgr or perhaps the natal gas from which this star was born .    core  5 appears to straddle the south east quadrant of the 8@xmath47 m ir shell or excitation ring of g5.89 - 0.39a and hess  j1800 - 240b , and is resolved into two components core  5 ne and sw .",
    "local peaks in co emission overlapping core  5 ne and sw are clearly visible ( see figure  [ fig : codata ] and and also @xcite ) .",
    "core  5  ne is the coldest of the cores detected with @xmath162k .",
    "here we detect only nh@xmath0(1,1 ) emission in mapping , and only very weak ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) emission in the deep spectra .",
    "it is also one of the few sites where hc@xmath2n(109 ) is detected . in core",
    "5 sw we find @xmath137k and nh@xmath1(2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) emission being stronger than in the ne .",
    "there is also hc@xmath0n(32 ) emission when looking at the 5 to 20 velocity range in mapping data .",
    "overall , assuming a 0.2pc core radius , we find our nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) observations trace @xmath8100 to 450m@xmath129 and density @xmath16380 to 300@xmath158@xmath160 for the individual cores in the triple  core and core  5 complexes .",
    "the core masses are in general agreement with their virial masses .    higher resolution nh@xmath1(3,3 )",
    "observations of g5.39 - 0.39b by @xcite with the vla suggest a 0.2pc radius molecular envelope around g5.89 - 0.39b ( triple  core  central ) tracing @xmath830m@xmath129 assuming an abundance ratio @xmath164 . using our abundance ratio this mass converts to @xmath81500m@xmath129 , about a factor 5 larger than our mass estimate using the nh@xmath1(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) emission .",
    "this difference may arise from the fact that our analysis is not sensitive to the slightly broader ( 3,3 ) line .",
    "in addition @xcite estimates a core mass ( for radius 0.15pc ) using simba 1.2 mm continuum observations of 360m@xmath129 and derives similar virial masses from the linewidths of n@xmath3h@xmath142(10 ) , h@xmath45co(10 ) , @xmath45co(10 ) and ch@xmath1oh transitions , which are in general agreement with our results .    assuming the triple  core and core  5 complexes represent extended sources , or at least the superposition of many unresolved point sources , we derive masses and densities ( table  [ tab : mass_dens ] ) of @xmath83300 and 1300m@xmath129 respectively with @xmath1653 from the average nh@xmath1(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) emission . as for core  2",
    ", such estimates do not consider the ( 3,3 ) emission seen towards triple  core  central and se and are therefore likely to underestimate the true extended mass .",
    "nevertheless using these mass estimates the individual nh@xmath1 cores represent about 35% of the extended mass traced by nh@xmath1 , for the two complexes , highlighting their generally clumpy nature .",
    "we also find that the extended mass traced by nh@xmath1 represents only small fraction @xmath85% of the total cloud mass , @xmath166m@xmath129 , for the hess  j1800 - 240b region traced by the nanten @xmath6co(10 ) observations over the = 0 to 20 range @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is whether or not the w28 snr shock has reached the southern molecular clouds , as it appears to have done for core  2 in the ne .",
    "of interest therefore is the spatial distribution of any disruption in the molecular clouds associated with the triple  core and core  5 complexes .",
    "the velocity dispersion image in figure  [ fig : veldisp ] clearly shows the broader nh@xmath1 gas is found concentrated towards the central star formation cores in constrast to core  2 where the disruption appears to originate more from one side . as a result we would conclude",
    "there is no evidence ( within the sensitivity limits of our mapping ) for any external disruption of the southern molecular clouds .",
    "we have used the mopra 22 m telescope for 12 mm line mapping over a degree - scale area covering the dense molecular gas towards the w28 snr field .",
    "our aim has been to probe the dense molecular cores of the gas spatially matching the four tev gamma - ray source observed by the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescopes in this region .",
    "the wide 8ghz bandpass of the mopra telescopes allows to search for a wealth of molecular lines tracing dense gas . for our purpose",
    ", the empphasis has been on the inversion transitions of nh@xmath1 which allow relatively robust estimates of gas temperature and optical depth .",
    "our observations combine data from dedicated scans and those from the the 12 mm hops project and reveal dense clumpy cores of nh@xmath1 towards most of the molecular cloud complexes overlapping the gamma - ray emission .",
    "additional 12 mm lines were detected , including the cyanopolyynes hc@xmath0n and hc@xmath2n , h@xmath3o masers , and radio recombination lines , which are prominent towards the uc- complex g5.89 - 0.39 .",
    "the nh@xmath1 cores are generally found in regions of @xmath6co peaks and mostly represent sites of star formation at various stages from pre - stellar cores to regions .",
    "a standout exception to this is the shocked molecular cloud on the north east boundary of the w28 snr where we detect very broad @xmath167 nh@xmath1 emission up to the ( 9,9 ) transition with kinetic temperature @xmath4640k .",
    "the velocity dispersion of this broad gas further supports the idea that the snr w28 is the source of molecular disruption .    based on analysis of the nh@xmath1(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) transitions we estimate total core masses for pure hydrogen in the range 75 to 900m@xmath139 assuming a core radius of 0.2pc .",
    "molecular hydrogen densities @xmath70 are in the range 40 to 500@xmath1683 , however scaling factors for various core sizes included in table  [ tab : mass_dens ] indicate that density varies with core radius while mass is more robust to changes in @xmath71 .",
    "obviously the estimates for core masses and densities are heavily dependent on the chosen nh@xmath0 abundance , however , the general agreement between the derived mass and virial mass for the detected cores appears to vindicate our choice of @xmath72 .",
    "optical depths are in the range 14 and 0.21.2 for the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) transitions respectively .",
    "the north east nh@xmath1 core ( core  2 ) is extended and our radiative transfer analysis of the broad line components imply a total mass of at least 1300m@xmath129 and density @xmath1693 .",
    "this represents @xmath465% of the total north east molecular mass traced by @xmath6co(10 ) observations . for the southern molecular clouds harbouring regions , the velocity dispersion centres on the individual cores ( triple  core se / central / nw and core  5 ne / sw ) towards the centre of the molecular clouds .",
    "thus at this stage we find no evidence ( limited by the @xmath80.05k per channel sensitivity of our mapping ) for cloud disruption from external sources such as from w28 to the north , and thus it s likely the w28 shock has yet to reach the southern molecular clouds .",
    "of course this does not constrain the much faster transport of cosmic - rays from w28 to the southern clouds .",
    "additionally we note the densities for core  2 , triple  core and core  5 ( table  [ tab : mass_dens ] ) averaged over extended spherical regions are about a factor 10 below the critical density for nh@xmath1 .",
    "this would suggest that much of the cores mass is probably contained within a smaller averaged volume than that considered here , emphasising their clumpy nature .",
    "another possible explanation for the lower densities could be the choice of spherical geometry , especially for the core  2 region it is plausible that the shock has compressed the core deforming its geometry .",
    "this work is part of our ongoing study into the molecular gas towards the w28 region , and help to further understand internal structures and dynamics of the molecular gas in the w28 snr field .",
    "deeper observations in 2010 reaching a @xmath80.02k channel sensitivity in the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) to ( 6,6 ) ( including ( 4,4 ) ) transitions , have been made with mopra in 12 mm towards the ne ( core  2 ) .",
    "these deep observations will permit pixel - by - pixel determination of gas parameters such as density , temperature and line width .",
    "they will therefore permit a much more detailed probe of the effects of the snr shock propagating into the core  2 cloud , using theoretical predictions of the effects of shocks in molecular clouds  @xcite .",
    "additionally , we recently completed a survey in the 7 mm band to trace the disrupted and shocked gas with the sio(10 ) and cs(10 ) lines .",
    "finally , we would also add that deeper gamma - ray observations of the w28 sources will allow higher resolution gamma - ray imaging approaching the molecular core sizes revealed in this study .",
    "this , when combined with knowledge of molecular cloud structures on arcminute scales , will pave the way to probe the diffusion properties of cosmic - rays potentially producing the tev gamma - ray emission .",
    "b. n. would like to thank nigel maxted for useful discussions and the referee for comments which improved the quality of this work .",
    "this work was supported by an australian research council grant ( dp0662810 ) .",
    "the mopra telescope is part of the australia telescope and is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
    "the university of new south wales mopra spectrometer digital filter bank used for these mopra observations was provided with support from the australian research council , together with the university of new south wales , university of sydney , monash university and the csiro .",

    "<S> here we detect broad nh@xmath0 , up to the ( 9,9 ) transition , with linewidths up to 16 . </S>",
    "<S> this broad nh@xmath1 emission spatially matches well with the tev source hess  j1801 - 233 and co emission , and its velocity dispersion distribution suggests external disruption from the w28 snr direction . </S>",
    "<S> other lines are detected , such as hc@xmath0n and hc@xmath2n , h@xmath3o masers , and many radio recombination lines , all of which are primarily found towards the southern high - mass star formation regions . </S>",
    "<S> these observations provide a new view onto the internal structures and dynamics of the dense molecular gas towards the w28 snr field , and in tandem with future higher resolution tev gamma - ray observations will offer the chance to probe the transport of cosmic - rays into molecular clouds .    </S>",
