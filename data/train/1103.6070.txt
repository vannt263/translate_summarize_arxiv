    "although it is sufficient for many problems to treat the al@xmath132 as point charges , a more accurate theory may wish to include the effect of the the core radius and well - depth of the electron - ion interaction via a pseudopotential .",
    "such pseudopotentials are well known at zero temperature .",
    "a very simple model is that of ashcroft , while modern implementations are very sophisticated .",
    "al - pseudopotentials suitable for wdm have been given in parametrized from by perrot and dharma - wardana @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to generate the charge density @xmath18 around a given nucleus of charge @xmath133 , immersed in a uef of density parameter @xmath35 , at a temperature @xmath21 .",
    "the ion is place in a spherical cavity in the positive background ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath18 is determined by a kohn - sham calculation which satisfies the friedel sum rule and other properties .",
    "then we _ define _ a weak non - local pseudopotential @xmath134 by the following relations in @xmath135-space .",
    "@xmath136 here @xmath137 is the lindhard response function at finite @xmath21 and electron wigner - seitz radius @xmath35 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 is a local field correction consistent with the density and temperature of the uef .",
    "further more , @xmath140 is the fourier transform of the real - space free - electron - density pileup @xmath141 calculated at the jellium density @xmath142 and temperature @xmath21 , for the nucleus @xmath143 .",
    "that is @xmath144 the bound electron density @xmath145 is obtained from the orbitals of the finite-@xmath21 kohn - sham equation as in perrot @xcite . here it should be noted that the bound electrons have to be assigned to a nucleus keeping in mind that some bound states are those of ` hopping electrons ' which form a band of localized states near the continuum @xcite .",
    "equation [ pseudlinear.eq ] _ defines _ the pseudopotential to be capable of recovering the charge - pile up via linear response .",
    "hence it has to render a weak potential .",
    "it is not very satisfactory if the resulting pseudopotential proves to be strong .",
    "however , the method seems to work in most cases .",
    "the pseudopotential can usually be parametrized ( as in an ashcroft empty - core potential ) , with a core depth @xmath146 and a core radius @xmath147 such that @xmath148 this is evidently a very simple form , compared to modern , hard , non - local pseudopotentials used in solid - state calculations at @xmath3 .",
    "such modern potentials remove the core , but a kohn - sham equation has to be solved as they are _ not weak _ , and can not be treated using linear response .",
    "however , we have found that simple potentials as in eqs .",
    "[ pseudlinear.eq]-[pseud2 ] are adequate for even the liquid - metal regime close to the melting point , even for metals which require non - local pseudopotentials at @xmath3 .",
    "excellent accuracy is obtained if the response functions @xmath149 are calculated for electrons with an effective mass @xmath31 specified for each case .",
    "it is particularly important to note that the ` mean ionization ' , i.e. , @xmath112 is a parameter which appears in the pseudopotential .",
    "the @xmath112 is also the lagrange parameter defining the total charge neutrality of the plasma , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite . a few examples of this type of simple pseudopotentials are given in table [ pseud.tab ] .",
    "cccccc element & @xmath150 & @xmath112 & @xmath146 & @xmath147 & @xmath31 +   + al & 3.141 & 3.0 & 0.3701 & 0.3054 & 0.998 + c & 2.718 & 4.0 & 0.0 & 0.3955 & 1.658 + si & 3.073 & 4.0 & 0.0 & 0.9475 & 0.98 +    [ pseud.tab ]    the c and si pseudopotentials were used to generate pdfs of these ionic liquids and compared with car - parinello simulations in ref .  @xcite .",
    "thus these pseudo - potentials can be used in the chnc equations , or in the cmmd simulations , to take account of the existence of a finite - sized core .",
    "such methods can be used to discuss properties of warm dense matter , thus providing a complementary approach to the simulations based on statistical potentials discussed by graziani _",
    "_ in the context of the cimarron project for simulations of warm dense matter @xcite .",
    "when energy is deposited rapidly in matter using laser radiation , the electrons absorb the energy directly and equilibriate among themselves , achieving a very high electron temperature @xmath118 .",
    "the ion subsystem , at temperature @xmath119 , takes much longer to heat up due to the slow temperature relaxation via the electron - ion interaction .",
    "hence , in laser - heated systems , it is common to find @xmath151 .",
    "the inverse situation prevails in shock - heated materials since the energy of the shock wave couples to the heavy ions and not to the electrons @xcite .    the possibility of using a static approach like the chnc for non - equilibrium systems resides on bogoliubov s idea of timescales and conserved quantities .",
    "we have exploited these ideas in our work on hot - electron relaxation , both within greens - function methods , and within chnc methods @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath118 , @xmath119 in a two - temperature system are merely lagrange parameters which assert that , for certain time scales @xmath152 , @xmath153 , the subsystem hamiltonians @xmath123 , @xmath124 are conserved quantities .",
    "similarly , a number of other parameters , e.g. , quasi - equilibrium chemical potentials , thermodynamic potentials , pseudopotentials , @xmath112 , etc . , attached to the subsystems may be conserved for the selected time scales .",
    "in fact , the original discussions of quasi - equilibria by bogoluibov were used in zubarev s theory of non - equilibrium green s functions , and rpa - like results for the quasi - thermodynamics as well as energy relaxation were addressed there - in . however , rpa - like theories are of limited value . in strongly coupled regimes",
    ", the pdfs associated with the given subsystems can be constructed using chnc , where the use of the correct inter - subsystem temperatures ( e.g. , @xmath125 ) for evaluating inter - system pdfs ( e.g. , @xmath1 ) is essential .",
    "the nature of this inter - system temperature is revealed by its appearance in the inter - subsystem energy - relaxation formula @xcite .",
    "a calculation of the distribution functions of two temperature plasmas using hnc methods as well as md methods was given recently @xcite .",
    "the classical - map technique uses a classical fluid at a finite temperature @xmath20 to represent a uniform - density quantum fluid at @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is density dependent , and hence the extension to a system with an inhomogeneous density is not straight - forward . furthermore , integral - equation techniques like the hnc become very complicated when applied to inhomogeneous systems .",
    "molecular dynamics can be applied if a viable mapping can be constructed .",
    "however in this connection we should note that studies of confined classical electrons in parabolic traps have also yielded useful insights@xcite .",
    "the classical - map technique treats the zeroth - order hamiltonian exactly , i.e. , the map is constructed to reproduce the known quantum solution classically , requiring the confining potential to be mapped as well .",
    "even when there is no confining potential ( other than a uniform background ) , the zeroth - order problem of @xmath154 has to be correctly treated .",
    "this was done in the uef problem by constructing a pauli exclusion potential ( i.e. , the fermi - hole potential ) to recover the fermi hole in the @xmath27 exactly .",
    "when non - interacting electrons are placed in an external potential , e.g. , a parabolic trap , the uniform density @xmath36 modifies to a new distribution @xmath155 .",
    "classically , this distribution is of the boltzmann form , eq .",
    "[ boltz.eq ] where @xmath156 contains all the terms found in the exponent of the hnc equation .",
    "thus , given the @xmath155 calculated from a quantum mechanical treatment of @xmath24 which contains the parabolic external potential , it is necessary to invert the hnc equation to get the effective classical potential which corresponds to @xmath155 . a simplified approach to this",
    "was used by us in ref .  @xcite . at this stage",
    "the calculation is somewhat similar to the determination of the pauli exclusion potential , and hence the specification of an effective fluid temperature does not become necessary .",
    "the classical coulomb fluid at a finite temperature @xmath20 is still necessary for dealing with the many - body effects generated from the coulomb interaction .",
    "however , given a non - uniform distribution , there is no evident method of defining a unique @xmath20 and the simplicity of the original chnc method is lost .",
    "further more , the electron - electron pair - distribution functions now depend explicitly on two coordinates , viz . , @xmath157 .",
    "the use of molecular - dynamics simulations is more convenient in dealing with systems where the simplicity of homogeneous systems is lost .",
    "another advantage an md simulation is that the the bridge - function approximations are avoided .    in mapping an inhomogeneous system of density @xmath18 to a homogeneous slab of density @xmath36",
    "we have used the form @xcite , @xmath158 in dealing with 2d systems .",
    "the same method has been used by gori - giorgi and savin for 3d systems @xcite .",
    "using such a uniform density to define a unique temperature of an equivalent classical fluid , we were able to reproduce the charge distribution of interacting electrons in 2d quantum dots obtained from quantum - monte carlo methods .",
    "however , as we used chnc , it was necessary to introduce bridge - functions and boundary corrections which impaired the transparency of the classical map . hence this work @xcite",
    "may be regarded as a preliminary attempt .",
    "we have outlined the classical - map technique of treating the quantum many - body problem in fermi systems via a mapping to an equivalent classical system at a density - dependent effective temperature different from the physical temperature , and where the particles interact by a pair potential consisting of a pauli - exclusion potential and a diffraction - corrected coulomb potential .",
    "large numbers of particles , and their thermodynamics or quasi - thermodynamics can be easily calculated . since",
    "pair - distribution functions can be calculated accurately , and at any value of the coupling constant , the adiabatic connection formula provides results for the non - local exchange - correlation functionals in an entirely unambiguous , rigorous manner .",
    "no gradient corrections , meta - functionals etc . , are needed .",
    "the born - oppenheimer approximation is not necessary as the chnc technique is not dynamical .",
    "hence the method would be of great interest from the point of view of equations - of - state studies , both for equilibrium , and for quasi - equilibrium systems .",
    "since suitable derivatives of the free energy with respect to density , temperature , and spin polarization lead to landau fermi - liquid parameters , the method is capable of easily furnishing alternative results for the effective mass @xmath31 , land-@xmath32 factor , local - field factors of response functions etc .",
    ", which are difficult to determine by standard greens - function perturbation techniques of quantum many - body theory .",
    "the application of the method to inhomogeneous systems is still poorly developed .",
    "similarly , the method , being a technique for the total energy as a functional of the pair density , is similar to dft in not yielding spectral information within its own formal structure .",
