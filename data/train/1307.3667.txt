    "for instance , the so - called _ mathematical fuzzy logic _ ( mfl ) , inspired by the paradigm of _ fuzzy set theory _ introduced in 1965 by l. zadeh ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , studies the question of vagueness from a foundational point of view based on many - valued logics . in this sense , mfl can be considered as a degree - based approach to vagueness .",
    "some systems like ukasiewicz and gdel - dummett infinitely valued logics are , just like fuzzy sets , valued over the real interval @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "this supports the idea of mfl being as a kind of foundational counterpart of fuzzy set theory ( which is a discipline mainly devoted to engineering applications ) .",
    "the book  @xcite by p. hjek is the first monograph dedicated to a broad study of the new subject of mfl . in that book the so - called basic fuzzy logic @xmath1",
    "is introduced as the residuated many - valued logic with the semantics on the real unit interval induced by all _ continuous _ t - norms and their residua .",
    "@xmath1  generalizes three prominent fuzzy logics , ukasiewicz , gdel - dummet and product logics , each one capturing the semantics determined by three particular continuous t - norms , namely ukasiewicz , minimum and product t - norms respectively .",
    "the so - called monoidal t - norm based logic ) @xmath2   was introduced in  @xcite as a generalization of @xmath1  to capture the semantics induced by _ left continuous _",
    "t - norms and their residua , in fact , as it was proved in @xcite the theorems of @xmath2  correspond to the common tautologies of all many - valued calculi defined by a left - continuous t - norm and its residuum .",
    "this logic , the most general residuated fuzzy logic whose semantics is based on t - norms , will be the starting point of our investigations in the present paper .",
    "frequently , vagueness is associated to a phenomenon of ` underdetermination of truth ' .",
    "however , vagueness could be seen from an opposite perspective : if @xmath3 is a borderline case of a vague predicate @xmath4 , the sentences ` @xmath3 is @xmath4 ' and ` @xmath3 is not @xmath4 ' can be both true ( at least to some extent ) .",
    "this leads to an interpretation of vagueness as ` overdetermination of truth ' , instead of underdetermination .",
    "being so , a sentence @xmath5 and its negation can simultaneously be both true , without trivializing ( as much we assume that not every sentence is true ) .",
    "this perspective , known as _ paraconsistent vagueness _",
    ", connects vagueness to the subject of _ paraconsistent logic _",
    "( see , for instance , @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "paraconsistency is devoted to the study of logic systems with a negation operator , say @xmath6 , such that not every contradictory set of premises @xmath7 trivializes the system .",
    "thus , any paraconsistent logic contains at least a contradictory but non - trivial theory .",
    "there exist several systematic approaches to paraconsistency , for instance : n. da costa s hierarchy of c - sytems @xmath8 , for @xmath9 , introduced in 1963 ( see  @xcite ) ; relevance ( or relevant ) logics , introduced by a. anderson and n. belnap in 1975 ( see  @xcite ) ; the adaptive logics programme , developed by d. batens and his group ; r. routley and g. priest s philosophical school of dialetheism , with priest s logic lp as its formalized counterpart ( see , for instance , @xcite ) ; and the logics of formal inconsistency ( lfis ) , introduced by w. carnielli and j. marcos in 2000 ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) , and also studied e.g. by avron et al . @xcite .",
    "the main characteristic of the latter logics is that they internalize in the object language the notions of consistency and inconsistency by means of specific connectives ( primitive or not ) .",
    "this constitutes a generalization of da costa s c - systems .",
    "the present paper proposes the meeting of fuzzy logic with paraconsistency in a very precise and foundational way .",
    "specifically , we introduce extensions of the fuzzy logic @xmath2  by means of primitive operators for consistency and inconsistency , defining so lfis based on ( extensions of ) @xmath2 .",
    "an important feature of this approach is that the lfis defined in this manner are not based on ( positive ) classical logic , as in the case of most lfis studied in the literature , including da costa s c - systems .",
    "in particular , the lfis proposed here do not satisfy the law of excluded middle : @xmath10 is not a valid schema , in general .",
    "the main novelty of the present approach is the definition of postulates for primitive consistency and inconsistency fuzzy operators over the algebras associated to ( extensions of ) @xmath2 ; in particular , we show how to define consistency and inconsistency operators over @xmath2-algebras .",
    "this generalizes the previous approach to fuzzy lfis introduced in  @xcite , where it was shown that a consistency operator can be defined in @xmath11 , the expansion of @xmath2  with the monteiro - baaz projection connective @xmath12 .",
    "however , this consistency operator is not primitive , but it is defined in terms of the operator @xmath12 together with other operators of @xmath2 . at this point , it is important to observe that @xmath2 , as well as its extensions , are _ not _ paraconsistent logics , provided that the usual truth - preserving consequence relation is considered : from @xmath13 every other formula can be derived . on the other hand , if a degree - preserving consequence relation is adopted , @xmath2  as well as some of its extensions become paraconsistent ( see section  [ prelim-1 ] ) .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sections",
    "[ prelim-1 ] and  [ seclfi ] , the basic notions about fuzzy logics and lfis are introduced .",
    "then section  [ secbola01 ] contains the main definitions and technical results .",
    "in particular , we introduce the notion of consistency operators on @xmath2-algebras and axiomatize several classes of them as expansions of @xmath2 . in this framework , the question about how the consistency operator propagates with respect to the @xmath2  connectives is studied in section  [ propag ] . in its turn , in section  [ recov ] we propose a fuzzy lfi able to recover classical logic by considering additional hypothesis on the consistency operator . the dual case of inconsistency operators is briefly analyzed in section  [ inconsist ] .",
    "we end up with some concluding remarks in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "in the framework of mathematical fuzzy logic there are two different families of fuzzy logics according to how the logical consequence is defined , namely truth - preserving and degree - preserving logics . in this section",
    "we review the main definitions and properties of these two families of logics .",
    "[ [ truth - preserving - fuzzy - logics . ] ] * truth - preserving fuzzy logics .",
    "* + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    most well known and studied systems of mathematical fuzzy logic are the so - called _ t - norm based fuzzy logics _ , corresponding to formal many - valued calculi with truth - values in the real unit interval @xmath14 $ ] and with a conjunction and an implication interpreted respectively by a ( left- ) continuous t - norm and its residuum respectively , and thus , including e.g. the well - known ukasiewicz and gdel infinitely - valued logics , corresponding to the calculi defined by ukasiewicz and @xmath15 t - norms respectively .",
    "the weakest t - norm based fuzzy logic is the logic @xmath2  ( monoidal t - norm based logic ) introduced in @xcite , whose theorems correspond to the common tautologies of all many - valued calculi defined by a left - continuous t - norm and its residuum @xcite .",
    "the language of @xmath2  consists of denumerably many propositional variables @xmath16 , binary connectives @xmath17 , and the truth constant @xmath18 .",
    "formulas , which will be denoted by lower case greek letters @xmath19 , are defined by induction as usual .",
    "further connectives and constants are definable ; in particular , @xmath20 stands for @xmath21 , @xmath22 stands for @xmath23 , @xmath24 stands for @xmath25 , and @xmath26 stands for @xmath27 .",
    "a hilbert - style calculus for @xmath2   was introduced in @xcite with the following set of axioms :    * @xmath28 * @xmath29 * @xmath30 * @xmath31 * @xmath32 * @xmath33 * @xmath34 * @xmath35 * @xmath36 * @xmath37    and whose unique rule of inference is _ modus ponens _ : from @xmath38 and @xmath39 derive @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath2  is an algebraizable logic in the sense of blok and pigozzi @xcite and its equivalent algebraic semantics is given by the class of @xmath41-algebras , that is indeed a variety ; call it @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath2-algebras can be equivalently introduced as commutative , bounded , integral residuated lattices @xmath43 further satisfying the following _ prelinearity _ equation : @xmath44    given an @xmath2-algebra @xmath45 , an @xmath46-evaluation is any function mapping each propositional variable into @xmath5 , @xmath47 and such that , for formulas @xmath38 and @xmath40 , @xmath48 ; @xmath49 ; @xmath50 ; @xmath51 .",
    "an evaluation @xmath52 is said to be a _ model _ for a set of formulas @xmath53 , if @xmath54 for each @xmath55 .",
    "we shall henceforth adopt a lighter notation dropping the superscript @xmath56 .",
    "the distinction between a syntactic object and its interpretation in an algebraic structure will always be clear by the context .",
    "the algebraizability gives the following strong completeness theorem :    * _ for every set @xmath57 of formulas , @xmath58 iff for every @xmath59 and every @xmath46-evaluation @xmath52 , if @xmath52 is a model of @xmath53 then @xmath52 is a model of @xmath60 as well .",
    "for this reason , since the consequence relation amounts to preservation of the truth - constant @xmath22 , @xmath2  can be called a _ ( full ) truth - preserving _ logic .",
    "actually , the algebraizability is preserved for any logic l that is a ( finitary ) expansion of @xmath2  satisfying the following congruence property +    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     as in the case of @xmath61 , due to the presence of the rule ( cong ) , @xmath62 is a rasiowa - implicative logic , and thus it is also algebraizable in the sense of blok and pigozzi and its algebraic semantics is given by @xmath62-algebras .",
    "a @xmath62-algebra @xmath63 is an expansion of a @xmath64-algebra with a new unary operation @xmath65 satisfying the following conditions for all @xmath66 :    1 .",
    "@xmath67 2 .",
    "@xmath68 3 .",
    "if @xmath69 then @xmath70 .    again , since the rules ( cong ) and ( coh ) are closed under @xmath71-forms , @xmath62 is complete with respect to the class of @xmath62-chains . obviously , the @xmath72 operators in @xmath64-chains have the dual form of the @xmath73 operators ( described in figure [ neg - bola ] ) , and we will not go into further details .",
    "the intended duality between both operators @xmath73 and @xmath72 is made explicit in the following results .",
    "[ translat ] let @xmath74 be a translation map from the language of @xmath61 to the language of @xmath62 which replaces @xmath73 by @xmath75 .",
    "conversely , let @xmath76 be the translation map in the opposite direction , which replaces @xmath72 by @xmath77 .",
    "then @xmath78 implies that @xmath79 and @xmath80 implies that @xmath81 .",
    "it is enough to prove that : ( i ) the translation of each axiom of the source logic can be derived in the target logic , and ( ii ) the translation of each inference rule of the source logic is an inference rule which is derivable in the target logic .",
    "the proof easily follows by using that in mtl the following formulas are theorems : @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "notice however that the above translations do not yield that both logics are equivalent : indeed , the translations @xmath74 and @xmath76 are not in general each other s inverse .",
    "this is due to the fact that , e.g. in @xmath61 , @xmath85 in general is not equivalent to @xmath86 . however , in the frame of the logic @xmath87 and its extensions , where @xmath85 is boolean , one can prove @xmath88 , and one can establish their equivalence with their @xmath72-dual corresponding logics .",
    "notice that if @xmath64 is an imtl logic ( i.e. whose negation is involutive ) , then @xmath87 coincides with @xmath61 itself .",
    "in particular , if we define dual counterparts of the logics @xmath89 , @xmath87 , @xmath90 or @xmath91 as :    * @xmath92 : is the extension of @xmath62 with the rule `` from @xmath93 infer @xmath60 '' * @xmath94 : is the axiomatic extension of @xmath62 with the axiom @xmath95 * @xmath96 : is the axiomatic extension of @xmath62 with the axiom @xmath97 * @xmath98 : is the extension of @xmath62 with the rule `` from @xmath99 infer @xmath100 ''    then we can list the following equivalences ( denoted by @xmath101 ) among logics via the translations @xmath74 and",
    "@xmath76 : @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 . and @xmath106 for the logics that respectively correspond to minimum and maximum @xmath72 operators , the dual @xmath90 is @xmath96 and viceversa , the dual of @xmath91 is @xmath98 .",
    "] as a consequence , the ( quasi ) varieties associated to pairs of equivalent logics are termwise equivalent .    to conclude , just to point out that , as in the case of the consistency operators , the paraconsistent versions of the above logics with the inconsistency operators @xmath72 would correspond to their degree - preserving counterparts , namely the logics @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111",
    "in this paper we have investigated the possibility of defining paraconsistent logics of formal inconsistency ( lfis ) based on systems of mathematical fuzzy logic , in particular by first expanding axiomatic extensions of the fuzzy logic mtl with the characteristic consistency and inconsistency operators of lfis , and then by considering their degree - preserving versions , that are paraconsistent .",
    "actually , in the same line of @xcite and based on a novel perspective , this paper intends to contribute to the study and understanding of the relationships between paraconsistency and fuzziness .",
