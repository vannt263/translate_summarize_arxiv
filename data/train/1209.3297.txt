    "advances in the experimental control , observation and manipulation of quantum - degenerate dilute atomic gases have led to a large body of work focusing on the role of geometry and dimensionality in the physics of these quantum fluids @xcite . in homogeneous systems , bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of an ideal gas",
    "is precluded in dimensions @xmath1 , and long - range order in finite - temperature interacting systems is prohibited in such low dimensionalities  @xcite . although some rigorous results exist for the harmonic trapping geometries typical of experimental dilute - gas systems  @xcite , these systems are theoretically less well characterized than their homogeneous counterparts .",
    "experimentally , these systems may exhibit _ quasicondensate _ behavior , characterized by large phase fluctuations and comparatively subdued density fluctuations , similar to that predicted to occur in homogeneous low - dimensional systems  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the finite size of such systems can induce some phase coherence across the spatial extent of the atomic sample .",
    "this might loosely be associated with `` finite - size '' condensation , which will not exhibit the _ extensivity _ property of a formal , thermodynamic bose condensate  @xcite .",
    "the physics of finite - sized and inhomogeneous quantum fluids in low dimensions are often more subtle than those of the infinite homogeneous systems for which more rigorous results are known ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and the effects of finite - size condensation and its relationship to quasicondensation and superfluidity in low - dimensional systems remain in general somewhat unclear  @xcite .",
    "a low - dimensional system of particular interest is the weakly interacting bose gas in an elongated ( cigar - shaped ) three - dimensional ( 3d ) harmonic trap  @xcite . in the limit of an extreme trap anisotropy , such that the oscillator energy spacing in the two tightly confined ( transverse ) dimensions is much larger than the energy scales associated with interactions and thermal fluctuations ,",
    "this system can be regarded as one - dimensional  @xcite . using a bogoliubov",
    " de  gennes ( bdg ) approach in density and phase fluctuations , petrov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite determined the phase diagram for this system , and identified a regime of quasicondensate behavior .",
    "their analysis nevertheless showed that , at sufficiently low temperatures , long - wavelength fluctuations of the phase are suppressed .",
    "the system is then phase coherent across a large spatial extent , and is said to contain a `` true '' condensate .",
    "importantly , bose gases in less severely elongated harmonic traps , in which the energy scales associated with interactions and thermal fluctuations are _ not _ smaller than the transverse oscillator spacings ( and which are therefore formally 3d ) , can also exhibit quasicondensate behavior .",
    "this was demonstrated theoretically by petrov  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who adapted their bdg density - phase approach to the elongated 3d geometry .",
    "using an analytic hydrodynamic approximation for the structure of the axial bdg eigenfunctions , and assuming classical ( equipartition ) occupation numbers for these modes , they calculated the amplitude of the phase fluctuations , and hence the phase coherence length @xmath2 , as functions of temperature .",
    "as in the purely one - dimensional case , phase fluctuations in this system become suppressed at low temperatures , yielding a gradual crossover from a quasicondensate regime to a true condensate .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite characterized the crossover to the true - condensate regime by identifying a temperature @xmath3 below which the phase coherence length @xmath2 is larger than the extent of the quasicondensate .",
    "the pronounced effect that interactions have on the behavior of this system is seemingly in stark contrast to the familiar case of unambiguously three - dimensional harmonically trapped bose gases , in which interactions serve only to slightly decrease the critical temperature for bec ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the predicted quasicondensate behavior of the elongated 3d bose gas has since been observed experimentally by a number of groups  @xcite .",
    "although yielding great insight into the physics of phase - fluctuating condensates in 3d , the approach of petrov and co - workers  @xcite is only approximate in nature .",
    "it neglects the effects of density fluctuations and their coupling to the phase fluctuations , and does not include the effects of fluctuations in the transverse dimensions . as the density - phase decomposition on which it is based assumes the existence of a quasicondensate with suppressed density fluctuations , it can not describe the gradual extinction of the quasicondensate , and the return of the system to the normal phase , with increasing temperature .",
    "moreover , as the fluctuations of the field are described without reference to an underlying condensate , the nature of the transition to condensation is obscured in such an approach .",
    "it is therefore not clear from such calculations to what extent the familiar picture of bec as a second - order transition remains relevant to the physics of the elongated case .",
    "a thorough understanding of the relationship between condensate and quasicondensate in this comparatively straightforward scenario would seem to be a natural starting point for understanding the role of ( potentially strictly finite - size ) condensation in low - dimensional systems .",
    "in this article we apply the well - developed machinery of classical - field methods  @xcite to understand the emergence of condensation and quasicondensation in a weakly interacting bose gas in elongated 3d harmonic confinement .",
    "the only limitation to this approach is the classical - field approximation itself ; i.e. , the neglect of the effects of quantum fluctuations , which are significant only at low temperatures .",
    "we make use of a grand - canonical variant of the classical - field method  @xcite that is fully three - dimensional and includes the effects of interactions nonperturbatively  @xcite .",
    "this method allows us to carefully characterize the condensate and quasicondensate , and the relationship between the two .",
    "although related methods have been used in several studies of the condensate ",
    "quasicondensate crossover in ( quasi-)one - dimensional systems  @xcite , the only prior classical - field investigation of the elongated 3d system is that of kadio _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite calculated the phase - coherence length of the elongated 3d system , and found approximate agreement with the predictions of petrov  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . however , their study employed somewhat _ ad hoc _ techniques  based on ideal - gas arguments  to estimate the temperature of the strongly fluctuating equilibrium state of the field , and was not able to access the statistics of the condensate mode itself , due to technical limitations  @xcite . as such , no detailed exposition of the relation between condensation and quasicondensation in the elongated 3d system is available in the previously published literature .    here",
    "we present an extensive , quantitative analysis of the progression from normal gas to quasicondensate to true condensate in the elongated 3d gas with decreasing temperature .",
    "we focus in particular on the nature of condensation in the system , which we associate with the orbital corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the one - body density matrix  @xcite .",
    "we characterize the onset of condensation by examining the number fluctuations of this condensate orbital , and the _ anomalous _ correlations of the part of the field orthogonal to the condensate , and thereby show that the gas exhibits meaningful bose condensation in the quasicondensate regime .",
    "moreover , we find that the onset of quasicondensation in the system is accompanied by a minimum in the effective interaction strength between condensate atoms that is consistent with the system undergoing a second - order transition to condensation .",
    "we find that this occurs at a temperature slightly below the transition temperature of the corresponding ideal - gas model , and that the appearance of a quasicondensate in the system is therefore associated with the condensation transition .",
    "the crossover from a quasicondensate to a true condensate at lower temperatures can thus be understood in terms of the correlations of the complementary _ noncondensed _ component of the field , which we find are inconsistent with well - defined quasiparticle excitations  i.e. , with gaussian , or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) correlations  @xcite  at high temperatures , but come to be more consistent with hfb correlations as the system temperature is reduced .",

    "atomic interactions described by the effective hamiltonian are mediated by an approximate two - body @xmath0  matrix , and the interaction can thus be rigorously approximated by a  contact \" potential , with a renormalized coupling constant @xmath13 . in practice",
    "the correction due to the finite momentum cutoff is small  @xcite , and so we assume the standard @xmath14-wave coupling constant @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the @xmath14-wave scattering length .",
    "the low - energy hamiltonian then takes the form @xmath17 which defines an effective field theory  @xcite for the coarse - grained field @xmath18 .",
    "we then further divide the low - energy region @xmath7 into a coherent region ( or condensate band ) @xmath19 , spanned by single - particle eigenmodes @xmath20 with energies below some classical - field cutoff @xmath21 ( the choice of which is discussed in appendix  [ apx : cutoff ] ) , and a complementary incoherent region @xmath22 . introducing the projector @xmath23 onto the coherent region @xmath24 , we define a @xmath24-region field operator @xmath25 in the spgpe formalism , the @xmath24-region field operator @xmath26 is treated in an open - systems approach , and the complementary @xmath27 region of the field is regarded as a thermal and diffusive bath to which the @xmath24 region is coupled . the resulting master equation for the @xmath24-region density operator corresponding to @xmath26",
    "is simplified by a high - temperature approximation and ( after neglecting terms which do not affect the _ equilibrium _ properties of the system  @xcite ) is mapped , using standard techniques  @xcite , onto a stochastic field equation in the wigner representation  @xcite for a classical field @xmath28 the resulting equation of motion @xmath29\\psi{_{\\mathbf{c}}}({\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}},t)dt + dw_{\\gamma}({\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}},t ) \\bigg\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is termed the _ simple growth _ spgpe @xcite .",

    ", @xmath35 can be thought of as extracting the effective ( local ) chemical potential of the classical field ; neglecting for simplicity the phase of the field , the local field amplitude @xmath39 therefore grows where @xmath40 is smaller than @xmath41 , and _",

    "an expression for the growth rate @xmath30 in terms of the thermodynamic parameters of the bath and the choice of energy cutoff @xmath21 was derived systematically in ref .",
    "however , in the present study the precise value of @xmath30 is unimportant , as we are only concerned with the equilibrium properties of the system , and not the detailed nonequilibrium dynamics of its relaxation .",
    "we thus choose a value for @xmath30 on the basis of numerical expediency ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : params ] ) .      the noise and damping terms in the spgpe [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : spgpe ] ) ] serve to drive trajectories of the classical field to a grand - canonical equilibrium distribution consistent with the imposed ( thermal bath ) temperature  @xmath0 and chemical potential  @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "the field undergoes a period of non - equilibrium dynamical evolution as it thermalizes toward equilibrium with the ( above - cutoff ) @xmath27 region .",
    "the growth of the ( quasi-)condensate from an evaporatively cooled thermal cloud would , in principle , be modeled by starting with an initial state @xmath44 corresponding to a high - temperature , noncondensed field  @xcite .",
    "however , as our interest here is in the equilibrium configurations of the system , we choose for our initial state the ground state of the gross - pitaevskii equation , which we obtain for each considered chemical potential @xmath43 by imaginary - time evolution . in this way we avoid the spontaneous formation of long - lived phase defects during the passage of the system from the noncondensed to the condensed phase @xcite , which can significantly delay complete thermalization  @xcite .",
    "once equilibrium is established , we characterize the state of the system by calculating correlation functions of the classical field ; i.e. , averages of functionals @xmath45 $ ] of the field over the equilibrium distribution of field configurations  @xcite .",

    "the classical correlation functions of @xmath39 are the classical - field analogs of quantum correlation functions of the bose field @xmath26  @xcite , and we interpret them as estimates of the corresponding quantum correlation functions ( i.e. , we neglect the formal commutator corrections of the wigner theory  @xcite , which is equivalent to neglecting quantum fluctuations ) . in practice ,",
    "we substitute time averages of a single trajectory @xmath31 for averages over the grand - canonical ensemble : @xmath48 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{n_s}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_s } \\mathcal{f}[\\psi{_{\\mathbf{c}}}({\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}},t_j)],\\ ] ] following the ergodic interpretation of the formally microcanonical classical - field methods  @xcite .      in this article",
    "we consider only equal - time correlations of the classical field @xmath49 .",
    "the expectation values of all one - body observables in the field at equilibrium are encoded by the first - order coherence function  @xcite @xmath50 the local ( @xmath51 ) first - order coherence function yields the mean density of atoms in the @xmath24 region , @xmath52 , while the off - diagonal ( @xmath53 ) elements @xmath54 depend additionally on the coherence of the phase @xmath55 of the classical field [ defined by @xmath56 between positions @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the matrix @xmath59 is hermitian , and can therefore be diagonalized to obtain a complete basis of eigenvectors with real eigenvalues .",
    "transposing the penrose - onsager definition  @xcite of bec to the classical - field description , we identify the largest of these eigenvalues as the condensate population @xmath60 , and the corresponding eigenvector @xmath61 as the ( unit - normalized ) condensate orbital .",

    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the inhomogeneous system we investigate may exhibit more general _ quasicondensate _ behavior , associated with the slow decay of phase coherence across the sample  @xcite .",
    "we will therefore make use of the normalized first - order coherence function @xmath62 to characterize the spatial decay of phase coherence in the system .",
    "another important characterization of the field fluctuations is given by the normalized local second - order coherence function @xmath63 which is directly related to the density variance : @xmath64  @xcite , and therefore provides a measure of density fluctuations . in the limiting case of a purely thermal ( chaotic ) field , @xmath65 , whereas @xmath66 for a perfectly coherent field  @xcite .    in a homogeneous system ,",
    "a quasicondensate is a component of the field that undergoes large point - to - point phase fluctuations , but in which density fluctuations are suppressed  @xcite .",
    "the quasicondensate density can therefore be estimated by considering the extent to which fluctuations of the field fail to be gaussian  @xcite .",
    "although such identifications in general bear no _ a priori _ relation to the structure of nonlocal phase correlations in the field , they do provide a useful characterization of the quasicondensate  @xcite .",
    "generalizing to the inhomogeneous case , the quantity  @xcite @xmath67 provides a useful measure of the field statistics in experimentally relevant systems  @xcite , and is often simply referred to as the _ quasicondensate density _  a terminology we will also adopt in this article . following from this definition we define the total quasicondensate population @xmath68 .",
    "we further characterize the physics of our system by analyzing the so - called anomalous correlations of the field fluctuations .",
    "in contrast to traditional mean - field theories of bec ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , our approach does not assume _ a priori _ a particular fixed value for the condensate phase , and hence preserves @xmath69 phase symmetry , in the sense that the grand - canonical ensemble sampled by the classical field is invariant under global phase rotations .",

    "the rates of forward and reverse scattering must balance , and so we expect @xmath77 to be purely real , relative to a real condensate orbital  @xcite .",

    "we focus primarily on the dependence of the field correlations on the system temperature at constant _ total _",
    "( @xmath24-region plus @xmath27-region ) atom number @xmath83 .",
    "as the system we study is fundamentally three - dimensional , we expect the transition temperature of the corresponding ideal bose gas to provide a useful point of comparison ( in contrast to inherently one- and two - dimensional systems , in which interactions can easily render the corresponding ideal - gas models irrelevant  @xcite ) .",
