    "the mean photon number in each faint laser pulse is kept very small ( about 0.1 ) .",

    "but there is a common belief that no matter what distribution the input laser is , if we attenuate it into a faint laser with sufficient small mean photon number , then poisson distribution would be a good approximation of photon number distribution in the faint laser pulse . so far , however , this claim has not been mathematical rigorously proved , which is the motivation of this work .",
    "we proved , that for a certain kind of probability distribution , after the binomial decay transformation , which is a mathematical description of laser attenuation @xcite , the decayed distribution can well be approximated by a poisson distribution provided that the expectation of the decayed distribution is sufficient small .",
    "it gives a theoretical validation of the above claim , i.e. , generally we can use a poisson distribution to approximate the photon distribution in faint laser and the error of the approximation could be neglected .",
