    "the order of phase transitions in 1 + 1 dimensions has long been a topic of debate among researches in the field of nonequilibrium phase transitions .",
    "while it has been argued that first - order phase transitions are impossible in this dimension ( see for example @xcite ) , most agree that such transitions are feasible .",
    "for example , dickman and tom sought to find the simplest model with short - range interactions that exhibited a first - order phase transition in one spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "they examined the pair- and triplet - creation models with the reactions @xmath0 with @xmath1 , 3 respectively . the mean field ( mf ) of such reactions yields a first - order phase transition , yet often , continuous transitions are thought to be observed in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "they varied the diffusion rate @xmath2 to see what effect this had since they expected that , with larger diffusion , the model would exhibit more mf - like behaviour due the better mixing of particles , and hence , a first - order phase transition might be observed .",
    "they found a first - order phase transition for the triplet - creation model only .",
    "a continuous phase transition was observed in the pair - creation model even when 95% of the attempted moves were diffusive .",
    "for the triplet - creation model , hysteresis was observed , indicative of a first - order transition , for sufficiently high diffusion rate .",
    "recently , fiore and de oliveira @xcite used the conservative diffusive contact process , in which the number of particles is fixed , to confirm dickman and tom s original findings ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "cardozo and fontanari @xcite also examined the triplet - creation model and found that the critical exponents change continuously from dp values to compact directed percolation values as the diffusion rate was increased . due to the strong crossover effects ,",
    "however , they were unable to locate the precise position of the point where the transition changed order .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to examine a slightly modified version of the pair - creation model in the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional case through both simulation and , importantly , mf techniques .",
    "the model has previously been shown , by mf , to exhibit both continuous and first - order phase transitions whose lines in parameter space meet at a tricritical point @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional mc simulations ,",
    "however , the model exhibits a continuous phase transition across the whole phase space . to examine this model further ,",
    "we employ a technique originally introduced by ben - avraham and khler @xcite which they called the @xmath3-site cluster approximation . in most cases , as @xmath3 increases",
    ", the method predicts increasingly accurate behaviour of the model in question . in this paper , we collect data for @xmath4 and extrapolate our findings as @xmath5 to obtain approximations for the order of the phase transition and value of the critical point .",
    "we have a @xmath6-dimensional square lattice of linear length @xmath7 where each site is either occupied by a single particle or is empty .",
    "a site is chosen at random .",
    "the particle on an occupied site dies with probability @xmath8 , leaving the site empty . if the particle does not die , a nearest neighbour site is randomly chosen .",
    "if the neighbouring site is empty the particle moves there and produces a new individual at the site that it has just left with probability @xmath9 . if the chosen site is , however , occupied the particle reproduces with probability @xmath10 producing a new particle on another randomly selected neighbouring site , conditional on that site being empty .",
    "a time step is defined as the number of lattice sites @xmath11 and periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "we have the following reactions for a particle @xmath12 for proliferation and annihilation respectively , @xmath13    assuming the particles are spaced homogeneously , the mf equation for the density of active sites @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 the first two terms consider the sexual and asexual reproduction reactions respectively and the final term death of an individual .",
    "equation ( [ e : mean field ] ) has three stationary states : @xmath16 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath17 , @xmath18 continuously as @xmath19 , indicative of a continuous phase transition with critical point @xmath20 for @xmath21 , we have a jump in @xmath22 from @xmath23 to zero , this time at the critical point @xmath24 further , for @xmath21 , we have a region @xmath25 where the survival of the population is dependent on the population density .",
    "in fact , we have extinction for @xmath26 for @xmath21 we therefore have a first - order phase transition .",
    "the two phase transition lines meet at the point @xmath27 , defining the position of the tricritical point @xmath28 . at the mf level then , we have a phase diagram as shown in figure [ f : phase diagram ] .     and",
    "the first - order phase transition for @xmath29 . equations ( [ e : critical point 1]-[e : critical point 2 ] ) have been re - arranged in the figure to make @xmath9 the dependent variable.,width=321 ]    in the region to the left of the transition lines , there exists at least one real and positive steady state . in the shaded region",
    "only , there exist two such steady states with none existing to the right of the transition lines .",
    "the tricritical point not only marks the intersection of the first - order and continuous phase lines , but also the line bordering the region with population density dependence .",
    "the mf technique that we employed in the previous section assumed independence between individual sites . in reality there exist , of course , correlations between nearby sites . increasing improvements to our original mf equation",
    "could then be made by considering pairs , triplets , quadruplets and so on , of adjacent sites .",
    "such an approach was developed by ben - avraham and khler , called the @xmath30-cluster approximation method @xcite .",
    "we direct the interested reader to ben - avraham and khler s paper @xcite and others ( for example @xcite and references therein ) for a detailed explanation of the approach .",
    "briefly , the method involves examining clusters of size @xmath3 . for sites @xmath31 ,",
    "we denote @xmath32 as the probability that the @xmath33 sites are in state @xmath34 at time @xmath35 .",
    "the method is concerned with how @xmath36 changes in time and involves deriving a system of master equations for @xmath37 . since @xmath38,1 in our case , there are @xmath39 such equations .",
    "it is , however , easy to see that the number of independent equations is much smaller than this ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "since we are concerned with clusters of size @xmath3 , we need a way to approximate @xmath40 from clusters of size @xmath41 . in their @xmath30-approximation ,",
    "ben - avraham and khler consider adjacent clusters of size @xmath3 with an overlap of @xmath42 sites .",
    "using the bayesian extension process , the approximation is then , @xmath43 for example , the @xmath44 approximation for a cluster of size six is given by @xmath45 ben - avraham and khler found that the @xmath46-approximation yields the most accurate results and is termed the @xmath3-site approximation for short .",
    "the simple 1-site approximation is just our original mf equations , so we examine the 2-site approximation . introducing the subscripts @xmath47 and @xmath48 for occupied and empty sites respectively , we have two independent variables , chosen to be the particle density @xmath49 and the pair density @xmath50 .",
    "it is then simple to derive the other 2-site probabilities @xmath51    to obtain the master equations , we consider the reactions which change the number of occupied sites @xmath52 and the number of pairs of sites @xmath53 .",
    "the reactions are listed in table [ t : pair approximation ] along with their probabilities of occurring , given the particle configuration . from this table ,",
    "the master equations for @xmath54 and @xmath55 are then derived in the usual way .",
    ".reactions for the 2-site approximation where , reactions such as @xmath56 for which @xmath57 , have been ignored . a symmetry factor arising from the parity symmetry",
    "has been included ( right column ) rather than writing both equations down . [ cols=\"^,^,^,>,>,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we clearly see how increasing the size of the clusters gives more accurate approximations for the behaviour of the model when comparing to the mc simulation results . in particular , for @xmath58",
    ", we show in the main plot of figure [ f : ca phase diagram ] b ) , the approximated values for @xmath59 against @xmath60 .",
    "an extrapolation of the results as @xmath5 shows excellent agreement with the mc value .",
    "unfortunately , at the first - order phase transition , when the number of real and positive steady state solutions decrease from two to zero , such an extrapolation does not lead to good agreement .",
    "this is likely to be due to the fact that at the continuous phase transition , the correlation length is infinite and therefore considering increasingly large numbers of adjacent sites will lead to more accurate approximations . at first - order phase transitions , since the correlation length remains finite , for @xmath61 we would expect the approximations for @xmath62 to be independent of @xmath3 .",
    "we can further plot the value of the tricritical point as a function of cluster size @xmath3 and , again , extrapolate . as the inset of figure [ f : ca phase diagram ] b ) shows , the position of @xmath63 decreases with @xmath3 , appearing to become zero for some finite @xmath3 . in other words , for sufficiently large @xmath3 , the corresponding @xmath3-site cluster approximation would predict no first - order phase transition .",
    "this , however , would be surprising since we would expect such behaviour to be true only as @xmath5 .",
    "since the tricritical transition is infinitesimally close to a first - order transition though , we may well expect a tailing - off of this apparent linear behaviour for large @xmath3 .",
    "we have seen how , for this model , the analytical cluster - approximation method seems to correctly predict a continuous phase transition in 1 + 1 dimensions across the whole phase space as @xmath5 .",
    "further , the method predicts , with a high degree of accuracy , the critical point for continuous phase transitions only .",
    "these findings highlight the power of the method for this case and will hopefully lead on to further examination of the techniques involved .",
    "all computer simulations were carried out on the imperial college london s hpc for which we thank matt harvey and simon burbidge .",
    "alastair windus would also like to thank epsrc for his ph.d .",
