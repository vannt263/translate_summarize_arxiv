    "we consider a discrete - time market in @xmath0 assets with transaction costs .",
    "we suppose that @xmath1 is the cone of claims attainable from @xmath2 by trading . in  @xcite , following on from schachermayer @xcite , kabanov @xcite , kabanov , stricker and rasonyi @xcite and @xcite and many others , jacka , berkaoui and warren showed that if @xmath1 is arbitrage - free ( i.e. , contains no positive elements ) then whilst @xmath1 may not be closed , its closure [ in @xmath3 is also a cone of attainable claims under a new price system and is arbitrage - free if and only if there is a consistent price process for @xmath1 ( theorems 3.6 and 4.12 ) . here , a consistent price process is essentially given by a strictly positive element in the polar cone of @xmath4 .",
    "a consistent price process is a suitable generalization of the concept of the density of an equivalent martingale measure ( emm).=-1    given a claim @xmath5 , a standard question is how to hedge it . in other words , how to find a self - financing trading strategy which achieves a final portfolio of @xmath6 with 0 initial endowment . in the context of frictionless trading , this is achieved by seeking maximal claims ",
    "claims @xmath7 which are maximal in @xmath1 with respect to the partial order @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it follows from kramkov s celebrated result on optional decompositions ( @xcite ) that , at least in a discrete - time context , a claim @xmath6 in @xmath1 is maximal if and only if it is priced at 0 by some emm .",
    "it also follows that this is true if and only if @xmath9 $ ] , the cone generated by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , is arbitrage - free , in which case its closure is also arbitrage - free .    consequently ( see @xcite or @xcite ) , one may obtain a hedging strategy for a maximal claim by martingale representation .    regrettably ,",
    "when there are transaction costs , just as @xmath1 may be arbitrage - free but @xmath12 contain an arbitrage , so , in this context , a claim @xmath6 may be maximal and yet the closure of @xmath9 $ ] contain an arbitrage .    in the language of optimization theory , a maximal claim such that the closure of @xmath9 $ ] is arbitrage - free",
    "is said to be proper efficient with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "we shall refer to such claims as properly maximal .",
    "we shall show in theorem [ equiv ] that a properly maximal claim is priced by some consistent price process and that martingale representation can be used to obtain a hedging strategy .",
    "it is then of interest ( for hedging purposes ) as to whether one can approximate maximal claims by properly maximal claims .",
    "this is a problem with a long and distinguished history in optimization theory , going back to  @xcite .",
    "we give a positive answer ( up to randomization ) in theorem  [ t1manu ] : the collection of properly maximal claims is dense in the set of maximal claims.=-1    in a continuous time framework , the problem is more delicate .",
    "indeed , the task of defining a notion of admissible trading strategy , that has a meaningful financial interpretation , is still in progress .",
    "a first solution has been given by kabanov @xcite , kabanov and last @xcite and kabanov and stricker @xcite , where the efficient friction assumption was made .",
    "more precisely , an admissible self - financing trading strategy was defined as an adapted , vector - valued , cdlg process of finite variation whose increments lie in the corresponding trading / solvency cones and whose terminal value is bounded from below by a constant with respect to the order induced by the terminal solvency cone .",
    "campi and schachermayer @xcite extend these results to bid - ask processes which are not necessarily continuous . in this framework ,",
    "the discrete - time methodology can not be adopted , as it is based on the fact that the cone of attainable claims for zero endowment is a _",

    "given a topological vector space @xmath14 , a pointed , closed , convex cone @xmath15 defines a partial order @xmath16 on @xmath14 by @xmath17    for a subset @xmath18 , we denote by @xmath19 the cone generated by @xmath20 , that is , @xmath21 for a convex set @xmath22 , we denote by @xmath23 the lineality subspace of @xmath24 : @xmath25 and recall that if @xmath24 is also a cone then @xmath26 .    given a subset @xmath27 , we say that @xmath28 and @xmath29 if the cone @xmath15 is not pointed then we change the definitions as follows : @xmath30 and @xmath31    one of the main problems in multi - criteria optimization theory is to show that each efficient point can be approximated by a sequence of proper efficient points ",
    "hereafter we refer to this as the _ density problem_.    it is easy to see that if @xmath32 is @xmath33-efficient , with @xmath33 a pointed closed convex cone such that @xmath34 , then @xmath35 is also proper @xmath15-efficient .",
