    "our knowledge of the structure of galaxies in general , and of early - type galaxies ( etgs : ellipticals es and s0s ) in particular , has evolved in parallel with the technological advances in the instrumentation used to study them .",

    "were obtained from ionized gas emission in external spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this revealed flat rotation curves out to large radii @xcite , subsequently strengthened by radio determinations @xcite , indicating dark matter surrounding the galaxies ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "dark matter is one of the pillars of the current paradigm of how galaxies form @xcite .    in the 70s long - slit spectrographs were used measure stellar rotation in elliptical galaxies",
    "this revealed that the massive es tend to rotate slowly , while less massive ones and galaxy bulges appeared to rotate faster ( ) . in the 80s photometry of es using ccd detectors showed that faint ellipticals can have disky isophotes , suggesting the presence of stellar disks embedded in dominant stellar spheroids ( ) . the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) in the 90s showed that the steepness of the inner galaxy profiles also relates to the other galaxy properties ( ) .",
    "hst also revolutionized our understanding of the link between galaxies and bhs evolution ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "in parallel to detailed studies of nearby galaxies , deep multi - band photometric galaxy surveys ( e.g.  goods @xcite and comsos @xcite ) , and multiplexed spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. deep2 @xcite ) were delivered .",
    "these provided the ability to trace galaxy evolution back in time ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the present review focuses on the progress in our knowledge of the structure of etgs , and of galaxies in general , brought by the next major technological advance : integral - field spectroscopy ( ifs ) .",
    "this brings the ability to obtain a spectrum at every position on a grid of sky coordinates covering the galaxy image .",
    "effective ifs prototypes appeared on the scene in the 90s ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , but it took a decade for them to reach maturity .",
    "ifs has recently become a standard asset on all major telescopes and an essential tool of astrophysics research .",
    "this review summarizes the status of our knowledge before another instrumental revolution .",
    "this is the time when the first generation of ifs surveys , which targeted one galaxy at a time ( ` sauron `  @xcite , atlas@xmath4  @xcite , califa @xcite , diskmass @xcite ) have been completed and a new generation of multiplexed ifs surveys , which can observe multiple galaxies simultaneously , is starting ( sami @xcite and manga @xcite galaxy surveys ) .",
    "this section gives a concise summary of the main findings on the structure of etgs before the publication of the first large set of ifs kinematics for etgs in @xcite .",
    "most early developments were based on photometry alone .",
    "extensive reviews were written on the classification @xcite and photometry @xcite of etgs .",
    "these include a summary of the historic developments .",
    "we will not duplicate that material here but rather refer the reader to those publications .",
    "we only mention the results and definitions which are essential to understand the findings from two - dimensional spectroscopy , which is the focus of this review .",
    "the focus of this review are etgs , although it will be clear in what follows that one can not understand etgs without linking their structure to the general galaxy population .",
    "etgs can be broadly characterized by their old population , red colors , small amount of gas and dust , and lack of spiral arms .",
    "these characteristics however are not equivalent . in fact",
    "applying different selection criteria for etgs leads to quite different sets of galaxies @xcite .    here",
    "we adopt the standard definition of etgs , as consisting the galaxies in the handle of @xcite empirical tuning - fork diagram . in the _ revised _ hubble classification system @xcite , the separation between etgs and spiral galaxies",
    "is entirely based on the presence of spiral arms ( or extended dust lanes for edge - on galaxies ) . this separation was adopted unchanged by @xcite and in the very popular third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rc3 ) . the same criterion was used in the rc3 follow - up hyperleda @xcite .",
    "this nearly universal definition of etgs is also adopted in this review .      for a number of years elliptical galaxies",
    "were thought to be well described by the @xcite @xmath5 profile .",
    "the work by @xcite discovered that the profiles of many es require the more general parametrization proposed by @xcite : @xmath6\\right\\ } , \\label{eq : sersic}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "most importantly , it was found that the sersic index @xmath8 , related to the galaxy concentration , increases with increasing total galaxy luminosity .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the reported correlations were interpreted as due to a systematic change in the intrinsic properties of elliptical galaxies with luminosity .",
    "however it can also be partially explained by a systematic variation in the fraction of hidden disks in ellipticals .",
    "most likely _ both _ effects play a role .",
    "in fact the sersic index of bulges of spiral galaxies and s0s tends to be different from that of massive e ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and systematic variations in the sersic index of spiral bulges also exist @xcite .      .",

    "the shape of es isophotes is quantified by finding the best - fitting ellipse , which provides a good first - order approximation , and then measuring the deviations from that ellipse . in the standard algorithm @xcite , the galaxy surface brightness , sampled along the ellipse , is fitted by the truncated fourier expansion via linear least squares minimization @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the eccentric anomaly , so that the angles are equally spaced when the ellipse is projected onto a circle .",

    "the launch of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) in 1990 revolutionized the study of inner profiles in es by firmly establishing that the centers of es do not posses flat `` cores '' @xcite .",
    "additionally it was found that the profiles of es could be broadly separated into two classes .",

    "a popular parametrization which was used to quantify the surface brightness profile shapes is the following double power - law ( informally dubbed `` nuker law '' by its proposers @xcite ) @xmath20^{(\\gamma-\\beta)/\\alpha},\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent the ( positive ) asymptotic slope for radii respectively smaller and larger than the break radius @xmath23 , where the surface brightness is @xmath24 , while @xmath2 determines the sharpness of the transition . from this relation",
    "the slope @xmath25 is typically determined as the analytic value inferred from at hst resolution limit @xmath26 . according to this definition , core galaxies are those with @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "alternative ways of quantifying inner profiles is by measuring either``extra light '' or a `` deficit '' with respect to a global sersic fit to the outer profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or using the `` core - sersic '' parametrization @xcite .",
    "reassuringly , the different profile classifications agree with each other with good accuracy @xcite .    some studies have emphasized a bi - modality , or dichotomy , in the distribution of the profile slopes within the general galaxy population @xcite , while others find a smooth continuity @xcite .",
    "however , the key and remarkable result on which all studies agree is that the inner slope is closely related to the global galaxy properties measured spatial scales more than one order of magnitude larger @xcite .",
    "this shows that nuclear slopes provide key physical insight on galaxy structure .",
    "to define our knowledge of the structure of etgs before the advent of ifs , we consider papers published before the two companion ` sauron `  papers introducing a _ kinematic _",
    "classification @xcite .",
    "key was the recognition of two classes , and possibly a dichotomy , among es :    * giant ellipticals ( @xmath28 ) : * ( i ) have sersic function outer profiles with @xmath29 @xcite ; ( ii ) have cores in their nuclear profiles @xcite ; ( iii ) rotate slowly @xcite ; ( iv ) are anisotropic and triaxial @xcite ; ( v ) tend to be rounder @xcite ; ( vi ) can have boxy isophotes @xcite ; ( vii ) contain x - ray emitting gas @xcite ; ( viii ) have old and @xmath2-elements enhanced stellar population @xcite .    * normal - luminosity ellipticals ( @xmath30 ) : * ( i ) have sersic profiles with @xmath31 @xcite ; ( ii ) are core - less @xcite ; ( iii ) rotate rapidly @xcite ; ( iv ) are nearly isotropic and oblate @xcite ; ( v ) can be quite flat ; ( vi ) can have disky isophotes ; ( vii ) rarely contain x - ray gas ; ( viii ) can have young population and are not @xmath2 enhanced .",

    "the photometric approaches to recognize different types of es , described in , suffer from two limitations : ( i ) measuring nuclear profiles require sub - arcsec spatial resolution ; ( ii ) deviations from elliptical isophotes are only visible near edge - on orientations .",
    "this prevents the applicability of either technique to the large galaxy samples at significant distances .",
    "a solution to both limitations is provided by ifs .",
    "in fact ifs observations of the stellar kinematics provide the long - sought ability to recognize the presence of stellar disks at virtually any inclination .",
    "this is illustrated in , which predicts , using dynamical models @xcite , how two nearly edge - on galaxies , the disky e ( as classified by @xcite ) ngc  821 and the s0 galaxy ngc  5308 , would appear when seen close to face on .",
    "the justification for the adopted models will be given in .",
    "the plot shows that both the centrally concentrated disk of a disky e , and the extended disk of an s0 galaxy , produce clear observable signatures in the kinematics at nearly all inclinations . in both cases the velocity fields",
    "display extended ordered rotation , with the kinematic position angle pa@xmath34 aligned with the photometric major axis pa@xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , the measurable effects on the isophote shape are hidden in the noise for inclinations @xmath36 . this is quantified in figure  8 of @xcite , which shows that even the strong disk of an edge - on s0 galaxy produces nearly elliptical isophotes ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the earliest ifs observations of the stellar kinematics used a simple but very time - consuming @xmath38-scanning approach , where a long slit is moved across the field to map a two dimensional field of the nearest e , centaurus a @xcite .",
    "this was followed by proof - of - concept large - scale observations of the stellar kinematics of individual etgs with real ifs units like the tiger integral - field unit @xcite on the cfht @xcite or the mpfs integral - field unit @xcite on the 6 m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory @xcite .",
    "a breakthrough came with the introduction of the ` sauron `  @xcite ifs , due to the dramatic improvement of the instrument data quality with respect to previous prototypes .",
    "the ` sauron `  survey @xcite was the first project to map the two - dimensional stellar kinematics , ionized gas and stellar population of a significant sample of 48 nearby etgs with total absolute magnitudes @xmath39 .",
    "a striking feature which became immediately apparent at a simple visual inspection of the kinematic maps of the sample galaxies @xcite was the qualitative separation between two classes of etgs : on one side were galaxies consistent with the models of , namely with what one would expect for disks seen at various inclinations ( e ) , while on the other side were galaxies clearly inconsistent with simple disks ( a  d ) . in two companion papers from the survey ,",
    "this initial insight led to the proposal of a quantitative kinematic classification of etgs , which is virtually independent on inclination effects @xcite .",
    "the ` sauron `  survey was followed by the atlas@xmath4  project @xcite , which , rather than being focused on ifs alone , was a multiwavelength survey combined with a theoretical modeling effort .",
    "it targeted a complete sample of 260 etgs , extracted from a volume - limited sample of 871 galaxies brighter than @xmath40 , within @xmath41 mpc .",
    "the observations of the sample spanned from the radio to the millimeter and optical .",
    "the survey includes galaxies with a minimum stellar mass of @xmath42 .",
    "atlas@xmath4  confirmed the striking visual distinction between the kinematics of `` regular rotator '' or `` non - regular rotator '' @xcite .",
    "it additionally defined four sub - classes of the non - regular class as illustrated in .",
    "non - regular rotators were found to ( a ) either not rotate at all , ( b ) to show clear but not bi - symmetric or irregular rotation , ( c ) to present a kinematically decoupled cores ( kdcs , these features were discovered by @xcite ) or ( d ) to indicate the presence of two counter - rotating disks ( like the prototypical s0 ngc4550 discovered by @xcite ) .",
    "a galaxy image is only the 0th moment of the line - of - sight stellar velocity distribution ( losvd ) .",
    "this suggests one may use an approach similar to that described in to measure the the shape of the higher moments of the losvd , and in particular the mean velocity field , which is the best measured quantity .",
    "like in the photometric case , the approach will work as long as one can find a good zero - order description of the velocity along the best - fitting ellipse .    in the case of photometry ,",
    "the zero - order approximation along a best - fitting ellipse is a constant .",
    "@xcite discovered that the velocity field of etgs along the best - fitting ellipse , is approximated by a cosine law @xmath43 with better than 2% accuracy .",
    "this is the same form one would expect if the kinematics was the one of an infinitesimally thin disk .",
    "the fact that this law is able to describe the stellar kinematics of etgs was thus unexpected .",
    "this finding motivated the extension of photometry to velocity fields ( and other velocity moments ) called kinemetry @xcite .",
    "a popular , so called tilted - ring method , to perform ellipse fitting to gas velocity fields existed well before kinemetry and was implemented in the rotcur program @xcite .",
    "@xcite used rotcur to fit ellipses to the gas velocity field of spiral galaxies .",
    "the observed velocity along those ellipses was subsequently measured and interpreted using a fourier expansion like in kinemetry .",
    "however , the key difference is that rotcur defines the best - fitting ellipse as the one which minimizes the squared deviations between the cosine law and the observed velocity samples along the ellipse , while kinemetry makes the low - order fourier coefficient equal to zero .",
    "this makes kinemetry more robust and ensures that the low - order fourier terms can not affect the higher ones .",
    "term , indicative of a secondary kinematic component ( from * ? ? ?",
    "]    in practice , kinemetry was designed to be a direct generalization of the fourier approach used for photometry . in close analogy to and , kinemetry samples the galaxy velocity ( or other odd moments of the velocity ) along an ellipse using the truncated fourier expansion @xmath44 where @xmath11 is the eccentric anomaly . now",
    "the best - fitting ellipse is _ defined _ as the one for which @xmath45 are zero within numerical accuracy , while @xmath46 is allowed to be non - zero .",
    "once the best - fitting ellipse has been determined , the velocity along that ellipse is again parametrized by the next higher term in the fourier expansion @xmath47 in this case the deviations of the ellipse from the pure @xmath43 curve are quantified by the @xmath48 term .",
    "similarly to the photometric @xmath17 parameter , which is sensitive to hidden disks , also @xmath49 is useful to determine the presence of multiple kinematic components .",
    "an application of the method to the e galaxy ngc  4473 , which is known from dynamical modelling to contain two counter - rotating disks @xcite , is illustrated in .",
    "kinemetry was used to describe all velocity maps from the atlas@xmath4  survey .",
    "@xcite found that the regular rotators are characterized by having residuals from the cosine law , quantified by the radially - averaged ratio @xmath50 .",

    "following the first study of the intrinsic shape of e galaxies by @xcite , a large number of papers have investigated the intrinsic shape of e and s0 galaxies by statistical inversion of their apparent shape distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an intrinsic limitation of these studies , is that the recovery of a generally triaxial shape distribution ( a 2-dimensional function of the two axial ratios ) from the distribution of the observed apparent ellipticity ( a 1-dimensional function ) is non unique .",
    "this remains true even when stellar kinematics is available @xcite .",
    "luckily , the vast majority of etgs turns out to be much simpler than the purely dynamical consideration would permit them to be .",
    "this allows one to measure their shape , even in the presence of degeneracies .",
    "in fact ifs data showed that _ all _ regular rotators have kinematic axes pa@xmath34 ( measured for @xmath52 ) essentially aligned with the photometric one pa@xmath35 ( at much larger radii @xmath51 ) @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in for a combined sample of 340 etgs .",

    "the few deviant objects appear to be either interacting systems or strongly barred .",
    "the _ only _ way to observe such a tight alignment , for such a large sample of etgs , is if regular rotators are axisymmetric out to their stellar halos , up to about 3 .",
    "this is because in triaxial systems : ( i ) the intrinsic symmetry axes needs not be aligned with the projected photometric major axis @xcite and ( ii ) the intrinsic angular momentum needs not be aligned with the intrinsic symmetry axes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that , in triaxial galaxies , kinematic misalignments are unavoidable , except in very special configurations .",
    "the lack of misalignment for a large sample then unambiguously implies axisymmetry for the whole class .    the alignment between the kinematics and photometry of regular rotators , out to a median radius of 4 ,",
    "can be seen directly , albeit for a much smaller sample , from the stellar kinematics obtained by the sluggs survey @xcite .",

    "although the sluggs data are in some cases rather noisy , the plot shows that in all cases where it can be measured , the kinematic major axis agrees within the errors with the photometric one , consistently with the global axisymmetry of the stellar halos of regular rotators .",
    "the ability of the stellar kinematics to separate the class of axisymmetric regular rotators from the rest , allows one to revisit the statistical inversion of the observed shape distribution .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that , once a family of objects has been proven to be axisymmetric , then the photometric statistical inversion procedure _ does _ provide a unique and well defined solution .",
    "this study of the intrinsic shape of regular rotators was performed using the volume - limited atlas@xmath4  sample by @xcite .",
    "they found that the intrinsic axial ratio of regular rotators , in their outer disks , can be described by a nearly gaussian distribution with mean axial ratio @xmath55 and dispersion @xmath56 .",
    "this distribution is consistent with that of spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one should note that this flattening mainly refers to the outer parts where disks dominate , but etgs have larger bulges than spirals as will be discussed later .",
    "the shape inversion remains non unique for the non - regular rotators , which show evidence of kinematic misalignment , implying triaxiality .",
    "however the kinematic data show that the intrinsic ratio between the smallest and largest axis of the triaxial ellipsoid , measured around 3 , must be @xmath57 .",
    "this is demonstrated by the fact that no kinematic misalignment are observed for the 38 non - regular rotators with @xmath58 ( ) . even ignoring the extra information provided by the misalignment , which is not always well defined for non - regular rotators , a stringent limit is placed by the fact that all non - regular rotators have @xmath59 ( also see ) .",
    "the small ellipticity of slow rotating galaxies is also confirmed using vimos kinematic observations of 7 additional slow rotator bcgs @xcite , using the mitchell spectrograph ( formerly virus - p ) for 11 more massive slow rotators @xcite .",
    "overall , out of the 73 slow rotators observed so far , _ all _ are rounder than @xmath59 .",

    "a complementary way of quantifying the information content of kinematic maps is via dynamical modeling of the stellar kinematics .",
    "a key assumption of the models is that the galaxies are in a steady state .",
    "the models also generally assume simple spherical , axisymmetric or triaxial shapes . under the steady state assumption ,",
    "the galaxy dynamics is fully specified by ( i ) the six - dimensional stellar distribution function ( df ) , which describes the distribution of the positions and velocities of stars in the galaxy , and ( ii ) by the gravitational potential , or equivalently the total mass distribution , which may include the stellar contribution , as well as a dark matter halo and supermassive black hole . a recent review of this topic was given by @xcite . here",
    "we focus on results specific to ifs observations .",
    "three major methods have been used in the past three decades : ( i ) the equations of stellar hydrodynamics , first applied to galaxies by @xcite ; ( ii ) the numerical orbit - superposition method by @xcite ; and ( iii ) the made - to - measure n - body models by @xcite .",
    "the first has the advantage that it has predictive power and that one can compute reproducible results to numerical accuracy . while the latter two methods have the advantage of generality , which is required for unbiased results .",
    "however these two methods can not make predictions , and depend on implementation details .",
    "the recovery of the df and the mass distribution using only line - of - sight quantities , is an intrinsically degenerate and non - unique problem .",
    "this is because the df is a function of the three isolating integrals of motion @xcite and one can not expect to uniquely constrain _ both _ the 3-dim df and the 3-dim mass distribution using only a 3-dim observable , as provided by the losvd at every spatial location ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , already the deprojection of the stellar surface brightness into an intrinsic stellar luminosity density is known to be mathematically non unique , even when assuming axisymmetry , unless the galaxy is known to be edge - on @xcite .",
    "this degeneracy increases rapidly at lower inclinations @xcite and represents a fundamental barrier to detailed models of external galaxies . relaxing the axisymmetry assumption further changes the dimension of the problem , and",

    "empirical explorations of the model degeneracies using ifs data have revealed that in practice , even in an ideal case in which ( i ) one uses simulated noiseless 2-dim data , ( ii ) one artificially removes the deprojection degeneracy and ( iii ) one assumes there is no dark matter and the gravitational potential is produced by the stars alone , still , also a basic parameter like the galaxy inclination , or equivalently its shape , is virtually unconstrained by the ifs data ( @xcite ; ) .",
    "tests on the ability of the models to constrain the mass profiles have also revealed ample room for degeneracies in the model parameters even with excellent data @xcite .      with the previous caveats in mind , key results",

    "they can appear quite flat , as expected due to their disk - like nature .",
    "however , unlike the regular rotators , they all lie below the magenta line in the  diagram , because they do not have oblate velocity ellipsoids , but are instead dominated by tangential anisotropy ( @xmath145 or @xmath85 ) . below the magenta line one also finds some galaxies which are classified as regular rotators by @xcite .",
    "these are likely transition objects containing an amount of counter - rotating stars which is too small to produce clear evidence for counter - rotation in the @xmath53 field , but sufficiently large to produce a detectable decrease of their global rotation .",
    "there is in fact no reason to expect a sharp transition between the regular rotators and the counter - rotating disks .",
    "the classification into one class or the other will simply depend on the amount of externally - acquired counter - rotating gas @xcite .",
    "it is useful to define a quantitative measure which approximately encodes the visual distinction between the two classes of regular and non - regular rotators illustrated in .",
    "a physically - motivated and clean separation can be obtained using dynamical models ( ) . and this approach can be used when maximum accuracy is desired .",
    "however it may be possible to define a more economical approach .",
    "another alternative is to use the dividing line @xmath144 on the  diagram ( ) .",
    "however the  quantity has one major limitation : it makes no use of the spatial distribution in the kinematic maps .",
    "for this reason a galaxy with a kdc like ngc  5813 ( c ) can overlap on the  diagram with inclined regular rotators ( e.g.  ngc  3379 ) which have dramatically different kinematic appearance , as noted by @xcite .",
    "this was the motivation to develop a new physical parameter which retains the useful characteristics of the classic  quantity , but also includes spatial information .",

    "when this proxy for the angular momentum is made dimensionless and normalized with a quantity like the @xmath102 , which is proportional to mass , according to the scalar virial theorem @xcite , one obtains the parameter @xcite @xmath149 where the @xmath131 are the fluxes within the @xmath150 spatial bins where mean stellar velocities @xmath129 and velocity dispersion @xmath130 are measured . and the summation is extended out to a certain finite radius @xmath151 , within a galaxy isophote .",

    "regular rotators are still generally described by the envelope of the magenta line and its projections , while non - regular rotators are not .",
    "the difference between the two diagrams is that , on the  diagram the regular and non - regular rotators of @xcite are significantly better separated @xcite .",
    "more recently , the sami - pilot sample of @xcite and the califa one by @xcite increased the number of slow rotators by @xmath153 .",
    "they strongly confirm the atlas@xmath4  finding that `` genuine '' disk - less slow rotators are all rounder than @xmath154 .",
    "counter - rotating disks were shown in to be structurally equivalent to regular - rotators and should not be classified as slow rotators .",
    "the new data motivate a refinement to the @xmath155 fast / slow rotator division of @xcite as follows , to reduce the risk of missing very round non regular rotators ( see ) @xmath156 the explicit inclusion of the roundness criterion in the classification allows one to identify etgs with disks , or fast rotators , without the need for kinematic observations .",
    "the separation between fast and slow rotators was _ defined _ by @xcite for  measured within the half - light isophote .",
    "for this reason a galaxy can not change its class when more extended data become available . in this classification like in most other ones ,",
    "the _ scale _ is important !",
    "the same is true e.g. for hubble s classification : a nuclear dust disk in an e galaxy may resemble a spiral galaxy from hst observations alone ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "but this does not make us classify the galaxy a spiral .",
    "similarly , an e which turns out to have extended spiral arms in very deep observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , should not be classified as a spiral .",
    "we stress that the classification based on the  diagram only constitutes an automatic and objective proxy for the more detailed classification based on the kinematic morphology of . for reliable results",
    "it is important to verify that the two agree !",
    "this implies that , when the data are of such a low quality that no visual classification is possible , one should avoid using the  alone to kinematically classify etgs , as this may lead to meaningless results .",
    "this is because systematic effects , like spurious fluctuations , on the velocity fields , produce systematic biases in , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite as in , while the brown line is the fast / slow rotator divide of .",
    "there is a broad agreement between the slow rotators and the core galaxies , but not a full overlap . ]",
    "as discussed in , the slow / fast rotator classes are expected to trace a similar phenomenon as the core / core - less classes respectively .",
    "this hypothesis was tested by @xcite using a sample of 56 galaxies with measured central light deficit from either @xcite or @xcite .",
    "they concluded that there is indeed a close connection between being a slow rotator and having a central deficit in the surface brightness , with respect to a @xcite profile extrapolated from larger radii .",
    "however the two classifications were not found to agree in all cases .",
    "the question was revisited by @xcite , using a subset of 63 galaxies in common between the atlas@xmath4  sample and the `` nuker '' sample of @xcite .",
    "he concluded that the two indicators generally agree , confirming they are both able to recognize dry merger relics .",
    "@xcite doubled the size of both samples to 122 galaxies , thanks to new hst photometric determinations .",
    "they used a core versus core - less definition based on a `` nuker '' profile fit ( ) , but they showed that different criteria differ only at the @xmath157% level . the main figure from that paper",
    "is adapted here in . in agreement with the previous studies",
    ", one can see that the general agreement is very good : nearly all round and slow rotating etgs do indeed have a core , and the vast majority of the regular rotator have a steep profile as expected .",
    "however core and core - less etgs do _ not _ overlap perfectly with the regular versus non - regular rotator classes , and for the same reason they do not not separate precisely at the slow / fast rotator divide .    to understand , at least in part , the small disagreements between the core / core - less and slow / fast classifications , it is instructive to consider a few individual examples .",
    "three of the core - less slow rotators are counter - rotating disks ( d ) . as these objects have disks and must have formed via gas accretion , the lack of a core makes physical sense and further emphasizes the fact , discussed in , that counter - rotating disks are essentially `` misclassified '' slow rotators , which instead form a continuous sequence with the rest of the fast rotators .",
    "one of the counter - rotating disks however has a core .",
    "this galaxy is the well - studied e galaxy ngc  4473 .",
    "the cored nature of its inner profile was studied in detail by @xcite , who suggested it may be due to a recent merger , which flattened a pre - existing cusp .",
    "the dynamics of ngc  4473 was modeled in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it was found to consists of two counter - rotating stellar components with approximate mass ratio 1:3 .",
    "this galaxy was proposed as a prototype of the counter - rotating class .",
    "the large - scale stellar counter - rotation , and the `` lemniscate '' ( which motivates the symbol used in this review to represent the kinematic class ) , or figure - of - eight , or `` double @xmath53 '' peaks , nature of this galaxy is beautifully illustrated by the combination of the ` sauron `  and sluggs kinematics in @xcite . in summary",
    ", this galaxy does not differ from the other counter - rotating disks , and in this case the `` core '' classification does not imply the galaxy assembled by dry mergers like the core slow rotators .",
    "overall , as these few examples already illustrate , it is not surprising that the two core / core - less and slow / fast classifications do not agree in 100% of the cases , although they agree most of the times . a galaxy which formed predominantly via gas accretion and",
    "originally posses a steep inner profile , may sometimes acquire a small gas - poor satellite which , in favorable conditions can destroy the inner cusp and nuclear disk @xcite , producing a core galaxy . the fact that most fast rotators are core - less indicates that this event is not a common occurrence .",
    "the small disagreement between the two classifications shows that , like in any classification , intermediate cases may exist and one should consider different characteristics of a galaxy , before making strong inferences about the formation mechanism of any individual object .",
    "the safest choice in this case is to consider as dry merger remnant only galaxies which _ both _ are classified as slow rotators and have an inner core .",
    "but unfortunately this information is not available for many galaxies .",

    "the fact that e always have @xmath159 is essentially a matter of definition .",
    "for this reason flat fast rotators are always classified as s0 .",
    "the misclassification of e is very significant . in the volume - limited atlas@xmath4  sample , as much as 66% ( @xmath160 ) of e turns out to be a fast rotator , namely an inclined axisymmetric galaxy with a disk @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the combined sample of , which has twice as many e galaxies , 60% are actually fast rotators .",

    "strong nearly edge - on disks show an enhancement in the measured mg@xmath161 or the inferred metallicity , which is flatter than the isophotes , while the age distribution is flat and featureless ( taken from * ? ? ?",
    "exceptions are ngc  4526 and ngc  4459 , which contain young star forming disks , also rich of molecular gas @xcite . ]",
    "integral field spectroscopy provides spatially - resolved stellar population information together with the stellar kinematics .",
    "using profiles of stellar population parameters averaged over elliptical isophotes , @xcite found a trend of increasing metallicity gradient with increasing galaxy mass for low - mass fast rotators @xmath162 , while the slopes decrease above that critical mass , so that the most massive systems have quite shallow logarithmic gradients .",
    "this finding agrees with long - slit observations by @xcite .",
    "the majority of the population was found to have negligible age trends .",
    "this is also true for slow rotators with kdcs , which have a population indistinguishable from the rest of the galaxy , in agreement with the sauron observations of ngc  4365 by @xcite and the oasis high - resolution observations by @xcite .",
    "it had been suggested that the local escape velocity @xmath163 , derived from dynamical models in which mass follows light , may be a better parameter to study stellar population gradients .",
    "the key advantage is that using @xmath163 , instead of radius , one finds local relations within a galaxy in quantitative agreement with global ones , among different galaxies .",
    "in particular @xcite found a good correlation between @xmath163 and galaxy color , while @xcite and @xcite found good global and local correlation of @xmath163 with the mg absorption line strength , for two samples of 8 and 5 etgs respectively .",
    "@xcite first investigated the @xmath164 correlation using ifs data .",
    "the significance of the @xmath164 correlation was demonstrated by @xcite for the 48 etgs of the ` sauron `  survey and by @xcite for the full atlas@xmath4  sample fo 260 etgs .",
    "the dramatic improvement of these two studies was not only due to the large number of objects , but to the fact that ifs data allowed one to obtain very high quality radial gradient of the stellar population and accurate dynamical models .",
    "these studies showed that the @xmath164 is truly universal in passive etgs , and constitutes an ideal benchmark for numerical simulations trying to describe in detail the local variations of stellar population in etgs .",
    "the ifs data not only provided accurate radial gradients , but also fully resolved spatial distributions .",
    "this fact revealed an increase of metallicity in fast rotators which is specifically associated with the disk component , rather than being uniformly distributed within the spheroidal or bulge component @xcite .",
    "this is indicated by the fact that all inclined fast rotators have contours of equal metallicity which are flatter than the galaxy isophotes , and generally consistent with the expected flattening of the disk component .",
    "this effect is visualized in .",
    "the figure also shows that the disk do not stand out in the age maps .    in recent times , thanks to the availability of high - quality stellar population models ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) with high spectral resolution based on large empirical spectral libraries @xcite , the studies of the stellar population from integral - field data has moved to the full - spectrum fitting approach ( using fitting codes like ppxf @xcite ; starlight @xcite ; steckmap @xcite ; vespa @xcite ) .",
    "recent results from the califa @xcite , massive @xcite and manga surveys @xcite , illustrate the power of ifs studies for stellar population .",

    "given that luminosity and size depend on distance , while kinematics do not , one of the first key applications of galaxy scaling relations was to infer galaxy distances @xcite .",
    "nowadays , dynamical scaling relations are a key tool to study galaxy formation .",
    "the main reasons are : ( i ) because they provide a statistical description for easily measurable properties of galaxies as a function of time ( redshift ) , which can be directly compared with numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and ( ii ) due to the fact that scaling parameters are actually expected to evolve very differently depending on the galaxy formation mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this section we review the recent development on scaling relations , focusing specifically on the advancements in our understanding of scaling relations made possible by the use of integral - field spectroscopy . @xcite and @xcite present two contrasting overviews focused on results derived via photometry or long slit spectroscopy .",
    "the first dynamical scaling relation to be discovered was the one between luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the observed relation had the form @xmath166 and the authors pointed out it also suggests a trend between the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath104 ) and galaxy luminosity .",
    "soon thereafter , a correlation between galaxy surface brightness @xmath167 and galaxy size was also found @xcite . when one defines the surface brightness as the mean value within , then @xmath168 .",
    "this means that the kormendy relation describes a correlation between galaxy radius and luminosity .",
    "the latter form has the advantage that it does not explicitly include galaxy size on both axes of the correlation , reducing the covariance between the measured values .",
    "the @xmath169 relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has recently become quite popular to study galaxy evolution as a function of redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , given that it does not involve any kinematic determination and for this reason is much more `` economical '' to observe than the faber - jackson .    thanks to larger systematic surveys of etgs it was later discovered that the faber - jackson and the kormendy relations are just two special projections of a plane described by galaxies in @xmath170 coordinates @xcite . this plane was aptly named the fundamental plane ( fp , see @xcite for a review of the initial results ) .",
    "it was found to hold for all etgs , including s0s and e galaxies , with a scatter smaller than 20% in  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the existence of the fp was interpreted as due to galaxies satisfying virial equilibrium @xmath171 , with @xmath172 the galaxy mass @xcite .",

    "the variation of the @xmath104 of the stellar population was immediately recognized as a potential source for the tilt of the fp @xcite .",

    "the _ average _ growth of the overall etgs population can be summarized has happening trough two main channels .",
    "the first one is dominated by gas accretion .",
    "spiral galaxies accrete gas , or experience gas rich minor mergers .",
    "the gas sinks towards the center , increases the galaxy mass and at the same time builds a bulge .",
    "the presence of a bulge increases the likelihood for the galaxy to have its star formation quenched .",
    "this makes the progenitor spiral end up as a passive fast rotator etg , with a stellar disk and , on average , a larger bulge fractions . as a result of this first channel ,",
    "all galaxy properties related to the star formation history , vary on average along lines of nearly constant .",
    "the fact that , at fixed mass , dense bulges have @xmath2-enhanced stellar population ( ) indicates that bulge formation must be a rapid process as expected during intense starbursts .",
    "the gas accretion and subsequent star formation leaves the metallicity enhancements of the disks in fast rotators as a fossil record ( ) .",
    "the second channel on the @xmath3 diagram is dominated by mostly - dry mergers , which move galaxies by increasing their size roughly proportionally to their mass , while leaving  nearly unchanged . during dry mergers",
    "the stellar population evolves passively and varies little for old systems .",
    "for this reason no significant trend is observed in galaxy properties related to the stellar population along this second channel .",
    "however dry mergers leave an imprint in the nuclear profiles , when supermassive black holes of the merging galaxies sink towards the center via dynamical friction and eject stars in radial orbits , scouring a nuclear core or deficit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations indicate that fast and slow rotator predominantly follow either one or the other channel . a key piece of information is provided by the environmental distribution ( ) .",
    "if slow rotators formed by dry merging of fast rotators : ( i ) they would roughly follow their distribution , like fast rotators follow the spiral distribution . instead ,",
    "their distribution in clusters is very different , with the slow rotators near the cluster / group centers and the fast rotators following spiral galaxies ( ) ; ( ii ) moreover one would find core slow rotator along the whole sequence of passive etgs , starting from @xmath286 , as they are still building - up their mass , especially in the filed . instead they suddenly appear only above @xmath209  ( ) .",
    "we mention in passing , that the region of the @xmath3 diagram below the zoe , but for @xmath162 , is not actually devoid of stellar systems .",
    "it is populated by objects generally called dwarf ellipticals ( de ) and ultra compact dwarfs ( ucd ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "evidence suggests they may be normal etgs which fell well into the halo of a larger galaxy and had their outer stellar envelope stripped ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "integral - field observations of the kinematics and population of these galaxies have just started and appears to confirm this interpretation @xcite . according to this picture ,",
    "de and ucd do not follow the main route of galaxy formation .",
    "this interesting topic will not be discussed in any detail here .          to understand",
    "how fast and slow rotators can follow separate evolutionary channels , one needs to consider the hierarchical growth of galaxies and clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to our current understanding of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , after the big bang , the primordial dark matter distribution is imprinted with small fluctuations and these inhomogeneities grow by gravitational instability to form dark matter halos .",
    "the primordial gas falls into a nearby halo and loses energy by radiating some of its energy .",
    "for this reason it sinks towards the halo center and forms a rotating disk .",
    "when the gas becomes sufficiently denser that the halo , it collapses into small clumps due to radiative cooling and starts producing stars into stellar clusters .",
    "the largest dark matter overdensities are able to acquire large amount of gas early - on , when they are still at the center of their own halo , dominating the overall gravitational potential .",
    "they quickly reach the critical mass above which the infalling gas is shock heated by the halo gravitational field and have their star formation suppressed @xcite .",
    "these massive galaxies are the progenitors of the slow rotators . the hot gas is actually observed in x - ray in local massive boxy e @xcite , in core galaxies @xcite and in slow rotators in particular @xcite .",
    "when two groups merge , during the hierarchical build - up of galaxies and clusters , the central galaxies in the two groups , which sit at rest near the center of mass of the halo , will efficiently sink to the center of the resulting larger cluster / group of galaxies via dynamical friction .",
    "these massive slow rotator will efficiently merge , due to their large mass and small relative velocities , forming a more massive slow rotator with an inner core scoured by the resulting black hole binary . in this way",
    "a typical slow rotator is able to remain as such for the rest of its evolution ( ) .",
    "this picture is similar to the one that motivates the separation of `` central '' ( i.e.  the most massive ) and `` satellite '' ( i.e.  the rest ) galaxies in dark matter halos , when building theoretical descriptions of galaxy and halo properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however in the theoretical approaches every halo has a single central galaxy , by definition . while in reality a given cluster , or a given massive dark matter halo , may contain a handful of slow rotators , which were central galaxies of their respective halos when they formed , but have yet to merge into a single object .",
    "for this reason the correspondence between central galaxies and slow rotators is only approximately correct .",
    "the regions of lower dark matter density are unable to efficiently acquire gas and grow more slowly and gradually .",
    "they form disk galaxies , which at high redshift are observed to have high gas fractions @xcite , have large velocity dispersion , are turbulent compared to their local counterparts @xcite and appear unstable to clump formation @xcite .",
    "these clumps may sink toward the center and start forming the bulge @xcite , or the gas may simply spiral toward the nucleus to grow the bulge in starbursts . during the initial stages , when the velocity dispersion of their groups is quite small , gas rich mergers can also happen .",
    "isolated spirals are able to sustain a nearly constant star formation for a long time , possibly with the contribution of the so called `` cosmological fountain '' effect @xcite . during this phase",
    "they lie on the so - called star formation main sequence @xcite .",
    "however the bulge growth ( and  or @xmath291 rise ) increases the likelihood for the galaxy to have its star formation quenched .",
    "some form of feedback is observed to stop the star formation and make the galaxy passive .",
    "the link between bulge fraction ( or central mass density ) and quenching is currently unclear .",
    "outflows from supernovae or from a central agn ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) must both play a role @xcite , as may the stabilizing effect of the bulge itself @xcite , which may contribute to the observed decrease of the star formation efficiency in etgs @xcite .",
    "evidence of feedback in action within a field fast rotator was presented in @xcite .",
    "these forms of internal feedback are needed to produce fast rotators in the field .",
    "but environment has a more dramatic effect .",
    "in fact , as soon as one of these disk galaxies is acquired by a large halo , its gravitational pull will be unable to acquire more gas , because their small halos will be orbiting at high speed within the ambient gas , which is at rest within the main halo .",
    "moreover , at sufficiently high gas densities , their own gas , including their corona and fountain effect , will be stripped entirely @xcite . as a result ,",
    "when disk galaxies enter sufficiently massive clusters , they stop growing , due to both the lack of gas accretion and inability to merge because of the high relative velocities of satellites .",
    "the environment will now only act via tidal perturbations due to the high - speed encounters , by puffing up their disks ( e.g * ? ? ? * ) . from then on ,",
    "the galaxies will be etgs fast rotators .",
    "their masses will stop growing during subsequent mergers of the parent group / cluster , while slow rotators will continue to grow in mass following the first dry - merging channel .",
    "this additional growth of slow rotators during the merging of clusters / groups , tends to produce a gap between the mass distribution of the fast and slow rotators .",
    "it explains observed know gap in luminosity between the first ranked galaxy in a massive cluster , and the subsequently ranked galaxies @xcite , also clearly visible in ( right panel ) .",
    "this picture is broadly consistent will all observational evidences , but nature is certainly not that simple .",
    "for example central galaxies in clusters are not always passive @xcite , however the small fraction of star forming ones is consistent with the general picture .",
    "moreover the channel from star forming spirals to bulge - dominated passive fast rotators does not always progress monotonically in one direction .",
    "rejuvenation events can happen in etgs @xcite and specifically in fast rotators @xcite .",
    "moreover the gas versus stars misalignment indicates external accretion @xcite .",
    "small fractions of neutral gas are detected in 40% of etgs in the field , especially at large radii @xcite . and",
    "tidal tails are not uncommon also in fast rotators @xcite .",
    "finally , all trends illustrated in have significant scatter .",
    "but the incidence of these events is fully consistent with the general picture we described .",
    "in particular , the ifs observations allow one to exclude a scenario in which passive fast rotators can acquire major amounts of gas and become star forming spirals again .",
    "these very bulge dominated spirals are extremely rare ( e.g. the sombrero galaxy m104 ) . moreover , if these events were common , they would erase the clear empirical inverse dependency between bulge fraction ( or ) and star formation indicators .",
    "similarly one can exclude a scenario in which the slow rotators acquire a disk and become fast rotators .",
    "this is because the dynamics of bulges in fast rotators is well described by the simple axisymmetric jam models over the whole mass range .",
    "this contrast with the strikingly different dynamics and shape of slow rotators , as revealed by the ifs data .",
    "this review was written at an ideal time , when studies of etgs using the first generation of ifs survey ( ` sauron `  @xcite , atlas@xmath4  @xcite and califa @xcite ) , those targeting one galaxies at a time , were nearly complete .",
    "the second generation of ifs surveys ( sami @xcite and manga @xcite ) just started but are actively acquiring data .",
    "a limited preview of the sami results was included in this review . at the same time",
    ", the new muse ifs @xcite , on the 8.2-m very large telescope of eso , started pushing the envelope of the data quality one can achieve on nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the goal of this review has been to define the status of our knowledge of the structure , kinematics and scaling relations of etgs , before the arrival of these new large ifs survey .",
    "we aim to set a benchmark for assessing how much we have progressed .",
    "galaxy evolution can be studied via detailed observations in the nearby universe or using evolutionary studies as a function of redshift .",
    "too often the groups working in one or the other field are unaware of the results of the other and miss the opportunity of combining the two sets of information to advance our knowledge .",
    "this review tried to emphasize and illustrate the importance of a synergy between the two approaches .    in the near future",
    ", one will be able to combine our knowledge about etgs from the upcoming multiplexed ifs survey , with the advances that the james webb space telescope @xcite will bring , thanks to its ability of obtaining deep near - infrared spectra , including ifs ( but not multiplexed ) , targeting the rest - frame optical spectra of etgs , free of the atmospheric absorptions .",
    "this will provide clean kinematics and stellar population for etgs out to the peak of their assembly epoch around @xmath296 .    in the more distant future , with the upcoming class of 40-m telescopes , like the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) and the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) , coupled with multiplexed capabilities in the near - infrared it will become possible to perform ifs surveys like the ones we described here , out to @xmath296 .",
    "we can only be looking forward to witness those new developments .    1 .",
    "using ifs kinematics , etgs separate into two structurally homogeneous classes with / without disks : the fast / slow rotators .",
    "we showed that there is a dichotomy , not a smooth transition , between the two classes .",
    "this dichotomy broadly agrees with the previously identified photometric separation into e.g.  core / power - law etgs .",
    "but the kinematic classification is nearly independent on inclination and does not require high spatial resolution .",
    "this makes it ideal for large ifs surveys .",
    "ifs revealed a close link between etgs and spirals .",
    "below @xmath0 , fast rotator etgs form a parallel sequence in galaxy properties with spiral galaxies . while core slow rotators dominate above @xmath1 .",
    "4 .   in the spirals",
    "to fast rotators sequence , suppression of star formation and molecular gas fraction are driven by the _ central _ mass density slope , or bulge mass fraction .",
    "etgs are dominated by stellar mass within  and their  is mainly due to systematic variations in the stellar population , including the imf .",
    "the total mass density is well - described by @xmath299 , from the center out to at least @xmath300 with small scatter ( in the currently explored mass range ) .",
    "slow rotators with cores are found near the centers of clusters / groups or subgroups within clusters .",
    "fast rotators are distributed like spiral galaxies .",
    "ifs observations , and redshift evolution studies , consistently and independently indicate a scenario where the evolution of fast / slow rotators follows two distinct ( i ) gas - accretion driven and ( ii ) dry - merger driven , evolutionary channels .    1 .",
    "what are the trends in population and kinematics at radii well beyond @xmath33 ?",
    "much information on galaxy assembly is contained in the stellar halos .",
