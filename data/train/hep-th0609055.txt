    "the magnetic monopole may be the most interesting , and perhaps the most important , particle to be never found .",
    "once the unity of electricity and magnetism was understood , it was quite natural to conjecture the existence of isolated magnetic poles that would be the counterparts of electric charges and that would complete the electric - magnetic duality of maxwell s equation .",
    "interest in the possibility of such objects was increased by dirac s observation in 1931 @xcite that the existence of even a single magnetic monopole would provide an explanation for the observed quantization of electric charge .",
    "a new chapter opened in 1974 , when t hooft @xcite and polyakov @xcite showed that in certain spontaneously broken gauge theories  a class that includes all grand unified theories  magnetic monopoles are not just a possibility , but a prediction .",
    "these objects are associated with solutions of the corresponding classical field equations and , in the weak coupling regime , their mass and other properties are calculable .",
    "these theoretical developments were accompanied by experimental searches for monopoles in bulk matter ( including rocks from the moon ) and cosmic rays as well as by attempts to produce them in particle accelerators . to date all of these have been negative , and theoretical arguments now suggest , at least for gut monopoles , that their abundance in the universe is so low as to make the detection of even one to be extraordinarily unlikely . already in 1981 , dirac wrote @xcite , in response to an invitation to a conference on the fiftieth anniversary of his paper ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` i am inclined now to believe that monopoles do not exist .",
    "so many years have gone by without any encouragement from the experimental side . ''",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    yet , in the half - decade preceeding dirac s statement magnetic monopoles had inspired two important lines of theoretical inquiry .",
    "first , the attempt to understand why there is not an overabundance of monopoles surviving from the early universe @xcite led guth to the inflationary universe scenario @xcite , which has revolutionized our understanding of cosmology .",
    "the second direction , initiated by the approximation introduced by prasad and sommerfield @xcite and by bogomolny @xcite , has led to considerable insights into the properties of supersymmetric field theories and string theory .",
    "it is this latter line of research that is the subject of this review .",
    "the bogomolny - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) limit of vanishing scalar potential was first proposed simply as a means of obtaining an analytic expression for the classical monopole solution . however , over the next few years several remarkable properties of the theory in this limit emerged .",
    "first , it was shown that solutions of the full second - order field equations could be obtained by solving the bogomolny equation , a kind of self - duality equation that is first order in the fields .",
    "solutions of this equation are guaranteed to have an energy that is exactly proportional to the magnetic charge .",
    "this suggests that there might be static solutions composed of two or more separated monopoles , with their mutual magnetic repulsion exactly cancelled by the attractive force mediated by the higgs field , which becomes massless in the bps limit .",
    "this possibility is actually realized , with there being continuous families of multimonopole solutions .    in the context of the classical su(2 )",
    "theory , the bps limit seems to be rather ad hoc , and the properties that follow from it appear to be curiosities with no deep meaning .",
    "their relevance for the quantum theory seems uncertain .",
    "indeed , it is not even clear that the bps limit can be maintained when quantum corrections are included .",
    "however , matters are clarified by the realization that this theory can be naturally expanded in a way that makes it supersymmetric",
    ". the resulting supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory has a nonvanishing scalar field potential  whose form is preserved by quantum corrections  but yet yields the same classical field equations .",
    "the classical energy - charge relation is seen to correspond to an operator relation between the hamiltonian and the central charges , with states obeying this relation lying in a special class of supermultiplets and leaving unbroken some of the generators of the supersymmetry .",
    "this relation implies the bogomolny equation in the weak coupling limit , but is still meaningful when the coupling is so large that the semiclassical approximation can no longer be trusted .",
    "there is another motivation for making the theory supersymmetric .",
    "montonen and olive @xcite had noted that the classical mass spectrum was invariant under an electric - magnetic duality symmetry , and suggested that this might be a symmetry of the full theory .",
    "however , when particle spins are taken into account , the spectrum is seen to only be fully invariant if the theory is maximally expanded , to @xmath0 sym . if the field theory is viewed as a low - energy approximation to string theory , this duality symmetry is a reflection of the s - duality of the string theory .",
    "the supersymmetry brings in other new features",
    ". if the gauge group is larger than su(2 ) , the additional scalar fields of the sym theory give rise to new classical solutions that can be viewed as loosely bound collections of two or more dyonic cores .",
    "these can be studied within the quantum theory with the aid of a low - energy effective theory .",
    "this is a truncation of the full quantum field theory that retains only the bosonic collective coordinates of the individual monopoles and their fermionic counterparts associated with fermion zero modes .",
    "the correspondence between the classical and quantum theories turns out to be rather subtle , revealing some unexpected aspects of the spectra of supersymmetric , or bps , states in sym theories .",
    "the spectrum of bps states becomes of particular importance in the context of duality , both in field theory and in string theory . in the 1990 s , as the notion of duality took on a more definite formulation , the study of the bps spectra became a primary tool for checking whether a duality existed between a pair of theories .",
    "this was true not only for the self - duality of @xmath0 sym field theory , but for the various dualities between the five string theories in ten dimensions and m theory in eleven dimensions , where supersymmetric states involving d - branes are often counted and matched with their dual bps states .",
    "although the initial investigations in this direction were fairly successful , the counting of more general bps states turned out to be anything but straightforward .",
    "this was particularly true for those bps states that preserve four or fewer supercharges .",
    "the existence of such states is often sensitive to the choice of vacuum and to the choice of coupling constants , which are then interwoven with the duality in a subtle manner .",
    "so far , no general theory of bps spectra is known , although much effort has been devoted to attacking this problem in the many guises in which it presents itself , including d - branes wrapping cycles in calabi - yau manifolds , boundary states in conformal field theories , open membranes ending on appropriately curved m5 branes , and bps dyons in the seiberg - witten description of @xmath4 sym .",
    "we believe the material presented in this review will shed much light on this general unsolved problem . while the methodology used here",
    "is itself somewhat limited , in that it deals with weakly coupled sym , some of the qualitative features should prove to be common to all these related problems .",
    "these include both the marginal stability domain wall and the large degeneracy , unrelated to any known symmetry , that is often found in bps states with large charges .",
    "we begin our review , in chap .  2 , with an overview of the su(2 ) magnetic monopole solution of t hooft and polyakov .",
    "we describe how it arises as a topological soliton .",
    "we also discuss the zero modes about the solution , and explain how one of these , related to the unbroken global gauge symmetry , leads to the existence of dyonic solutions carrying both electric and magnetic charges .",
    "we introduce the moduli space of solutions and its metric ; these concepts play an important role in our later discussions .    in chap .  3",
    ", we specialize to the case of bps solutions .",
    "we discuss in detail their relation to supersymmetry , and describe how magnetically charged states that preserve part of the supersymmetry can be obtained .",
    "the montonen - olive duality conjecture is also introduced here .",
    "chapter  4 is devoted to the discussion of classical multimonopole solutions . after developing the formalism for describing monopoles in theories with gauge groups larger than su(2 )",
    ", we show how index theory methods can be used to determine the dimension of the space of solutions .",
    "we describe a powerful method , introduced by nahm , for constructing multimonopole solutions and illustrate its use with several examples .    for a given magnetic charge , the multimonopole solutions obtained in chap .",
    "4 form a manifold , the moduli space , with the coordinates on this manifold naturally taken to be the collective coordinates of the component monopoles . in the low - energy limit , a good approximation to the full field theory dynamics is obtained by truncating to these collective coordinates , whose behavior is governed by a purely kinetic lagrangian that is specified by a naturally defined metric on the moduli space .",
    "the classical motions of the monopoles correspond to geodesics on the moduli space .",
    "we discuss the moduli space and its metric in chap .  5 , and describe , with examples , some methods by which the metric can be determined .",
    "most of the discussion in this review assumes that the gauge group is maximally broken , to a product of u(1 ) s . in chap .",
    "6 we discuss some of the consequences of the alternate possibility , where there is an unbroken non - abelian subgroup .",
    "among these are the presence of `` massless monopoles '' that are the dual counterparts of the massless gauge bosons and their superpartners .",
    "these massless monopoles can not be realized as isolated classical solitons , but are instead found as clouds of non - abelian field surrounding one or more massive monopoles .",
    "although sym theories with extended supersymmetry contain either two ( for @xmath4 ) or six ( for @xmath0 ) higgs fields , the discussion of classical solutions up to this point assumes that only one of these is nontrivial . for an su(2 ) gauge theory this can always be arranged by a redefinition of fields . however , for larger gauge groups it need not be the case , a point that was fully appreciated only relatively recently .",
    "the generic solution then has two nontrivial higgs fields , and is typically a dyonic bound state with components carrying both magnetic and electric charges .",
    "the bps solutions preserve only one - fourth , rather than one - half , of the supersymmetry .",
    "the low - energy dynamics can still be described in terms of the collective coordinates and the moduli space that they span , but the moduli space lagrangian now includes a potential energy term . in chap .",
    "7 we discuss the effects of these additional scalar fields , and show how to derive the potential energy that they generate .",
    "although we are considering supersymmetric theories , the effects of the fermions have been omitted so far .",
    "this is remedied in chap .  8 , where we introduce fermionic counterparts to the bosonic collective coordinates , and derive the effects of the fermion fields on the low - energy dynamics .",
    "the resulting moduli space lagrangian possesses a supersymmetry that is inherited from that of the underlying field theory .",
    "the discussions thus far , although being set in the context of a quantum field theory , have been essentially classical . in this chapter",
    "we also show how to quantize this low - energy lagrangian .    in chap .  9",
    ", we discuss the quantum bps dyons that arise as bound states of this lagrangian . in a sense , this is the quantum counterpart of the classical discussion of chap .",
    "we present the exact wavefunctions for several states comprising only two dyonic cores .",
    "although it appears to be much more difficult to obtain explicit wavefunctions for states with many cores , we show how index theorems can be used to count such states . an important point that emerges here",
    "is the striking difference between the spectra of the @xmath4 and @xmath0 sym theories . in particular ,",
    "only the latter includes certain zero - energy bound states that are required to satisfy the duality conjecture for larger gauge groups .",
    "although the monopoles that we discuss arise originally in the context of field theory , they find a very natural setting when the quantum field theory is viewed as the low - energy limit of string theory . in chap .",
    "10 , we describe how the monopoles and dyons of @xmath0 sym can be realized , in a rather elegant fashion , in terms of d - branes .",
    "in particular , we describe how this picture provides a very natural motivation for the multimonopole construction of nahm .",
    "there are two appendices .",
    "appendix  a provides some background material on complex geometry and zero modes .",
    "appendix b describes the extension of the discussions of chap .",
    "8 to @xmath4 sym theories containing matter hypermultiplets .",
    "the first example of a magnetic monopole solution was discovered by t hooft @xcite and polyakov @xcite , working in the context of an su(2 ) gauge theory .",
    "although many examples with larger gauge groups have subsequently been found , the su(2 ) solution remains the simplest , and is perhaps the best suited for introducing some concepts that will be important for our subsequent discussions .",
    "furthermore , this solution will play an especially fundamental role for us , because in the bogomolny - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) @xcite limit the monopole solutions for larger groups are all built up , in a sense that will later become clear , from components that are essentially su(2 ) in nature .",

    "[ sec2 - 2 ] .",
    "these static solutions actually belong to continuous families of solutions , all with the same energy . in the one - monopole case considered in this chapter ,",
    "these solutions are specified by four parameters , all related to the symmetries of the theory ; in later chapters we will explore the much richer multimonopole structure that arises in the bps limit . as we explain in sec .",
    "[ zeromodes ] , infinitesimal variations of these parameters are associated with zero modes about a given solution .",
    "excitation of these modes gives rise to time - dependent monopole solutions .",
    "translational zero modes thus give rise in a straightforward manner to solutions with nonzero linear momentum .",

    "this theory also has nontrivial classical solutions .",
    "the existence of these can be demonstrated without having to examine the field equations in detail .",
    "the key fact is that any static configuration that is a local minimum of the energy is necessarily a solution of the classical field equations .",
    "our strategy will be to identify a special class of finite energy configurations and then show that the configuration of minimum energy among these can not be the vacuum .",
    "it is fairly clear that in a finite energy solution the fields must approach a vacuum solution as @xmath22 in any fixed direction .",

    "the main difference from before is that the massive monopoles interact with each other even when the cloud is far in the distance . instead of passing undeflected through each other , as the distinct massive monopoles do , they scatter by 90@xmath1470 , just as a pair of su(2 ) monopoles would",
    ".    there is , however , a problem with these results . in all three of these cases",
    "the geodesics on the moduli space predict a cloud whose size grows quadratically with time at large @xmath153 , which means that its expansion velocity eventually exceeds the speed of light .",

    "however , we saw that when the symmetry breaking is maximal and the massless fields are abelian the radiation is sufficiently suppressed at low monopole velocities to preserve the validity of the approximation .",
    "an essential ingredient in this argument was the fact that the charged massive fields , which are the potential sources for the radiation , are confined to the fixed - radius monopole cores .",
    "the situation is rather different now .",
    "the possible sources for the radiation now include the non - abelian gauge fields , which extend throughout the core , and even beyond .",
    "some insight can be gained from an analysis that compared numerical solutions of the spacetime field equations with the predictions of the moduli space approximation for the so(5 ) example @xcite .",
    "the two agree well until roughly the time , @xmath1471 , when the moduli space approximation predicts that the cloud velocity should reach the speed of light . beyond this time",

    "instead , the expanding cloud essentially becomes a wavefront moving outward at constant velocity @xmath382 . in the regions well inside the cloud , however , the fields continue to be well approximated by the moduli space approximation , suggesting that the predictions for the asymptotic motion of the massive monopoles in the ( 1 , [ 1 ] ,  , 1 ) and ( 2 , [ 1 ] ) solutions remain reliable .",
    "it is interesting to note that the duration of the period when the moduli space approximation is valid is inversely proportional to the energy . using eqs .",

    "equation  ( [ theis ] ) gives a complementary result for massless monopoles .",
    "for weak coupling , the period in which the moduli space description of the cloud gives a good approximation is much longer than the uncertainty in time set by the uncertainly principle .",
    "hence , the classical description should be reliable on the times scales relevant for this analysis .",
    "there is one last topic we should address in this section .",
    "so far , we have only considered trajectories in which the gauge orientation collective coordinates remain constant , so that the gauge charges vanish . relaxing this condition",
    "might be expected to give dyonic solutions carrying both magnetic and electric charges .",
    "of particular interest would be solutions in which the electric charge was in the non - abelian unbroken subgroup ; because of the analogy with qcd , such objects have been termed `` chromodyons '' .",
    "these were first investigated in the context of an su(5 ) grand unified model .",
    "it was soon found that the fundamental massive monopoles in this theory @xcite can not give rise to chromodyons @xcite , because of the topological obstruction , noted at the end of sec .",
    "[ so5metric ] , to globally defining a basis for the unbroken gauge group @xcite .",
    "because the examples we have considered in this chapter have purely abelian magnetic charges , they have no such obstruction and so one might ask if they could be used to construct chromodyons .    the obvious starting point would be the so(5 ) example with a single massive monopole . a stable chromodyon would correspond to a geodesic trajectory with fixed cloud parameter @xmath170 and one ( or more ) of the gauge orientation angles varying periodically with time . since we already know that the geodesics are all straight lines in @xmath1042 , such trajectories are clearly excluded .",
    "they would be allowed , at least within the moduli space approximation , if the cloud size could somehow be held fixed .",
    "this can be done by going beyond the bps regime and adding an appropriate potential .",
    "however , a new difficulty , again associated with massless radiation , arises .",
    "not only are the non - abelian gauge bosons massless , but they also carry non - abelian electric charge .",
    "this opens up the possibility that the would - be chromodyon could radiate away its electric charge .",
    "numerical studies of the so(5 ) example @xcite suggest that it suffers from precisely this affliction , and there seems little reason to believe that the difficulty would be absent in other cases .",
    "hence , it appears that even when topology allows chromodyons , dynamics may not .",
    "up to now , we have concentrated on the physics of monopoles and dyons when only one adjoint higgs field acquired a vacuum expectation value . for the simplest gauge group with monopoles , su(2 ) , this restriction hardly matters , because one can always use the global @xmath489 symmetry of sym theory to remove all but one of the vevs .",

    "the global @xmath489 symmetry is independent of the rank of the gauge group , and so in general can not rotate @xmath1473 masses into @xmath62 masses . for the classification of generic monopoles and dyons in a generic vacuum , we can no longer stick to the single - higgs model .",

    "it turns out that when more than one adjoint higgs field has a nonzero expectation value the bps equations are modified in an essential way , leading to a new class of dyonic bps solutions .",

    "the coulomb phase , where the gauge symmetry is broken to the cartan subgroup , comes with a set of massless u(1 ) vector multiplets whose kinetic terms specify completely the low - energy dynamics . since an @xmath4 vector multiplet contains a complex scalar field , it is then a matter of specifying the geometry of the vacuum moduli space spanned by these scalar fields .",
    "one way to represent the massless scalar fields associated with the u(1 ) s is to assemble @xmath62 complex fields as the components of a column vector @xmath1861 so that the massive vector meson with integer - quantized electric charge @xmath1862 has a mass @xmath1863 . in the weak coupling limit , @xmath1864 .    because of the extended supersymmetry",
    ", the vacuum moduli space has a very restrictive kind of geometry , known as special khler geometry , and the low - energy dynamics of the @xmath4 sym in the coulomb phase is completely determined by the knowledge of a single locally holomorphic function , @xmath612 , termed the prepotential . in the weak coupling limit , this prepotential takes a universal form , @xmath1865 with @xmath1866 the prepotential is not a single - valued function , but instead transforms nontrivially as we move around the vacuum moduli space .",
    "this turns out to be a blessing , because its transformation properties are entirely determined by which bps particles become massless , and at which points ; the knowledge of these transformation properties is often enough to fix the entire prepotential exactly .",
    "in fact , @xmath1861 also transforms nontrivially as we move around the moduli space .",
    "the transformation properties of @xmath1861 and @xmath612 are tied in the following sense .",
    "one can define a magnetic version of @xmath1861 by @xmath1867 and , with this , form a @xmath1473-dimensional column vector @xmath1868 the vacuum moduli space of @xmath4 sym is riddled with singular points and cuts , but these are all associated with some bps particles becoming massless in some vacuum .",
    "the transformations of @xmath612 and @xmath1869 occur as one moves around such a singularity or passes over a cut , and may be expressed generally as @xmath1870 where @xmath24 is an element of the infinite discrete group sp@xmath1871 .",
    "the set of @xmath24 s are called the monodromy group .    in the coulomb phase ,",
    "there are charged particles that are electrically and magnetically charged with respect to the unbroken u(1 ) s above . in terms of @xmath1869 , the central charge of these particles",
    "is written as @xmath1872 where @xmath1862 and @xmath1873 are the electromagnetic charge vectors .",
    "the last term is a contribution from massive hypermultiplets with complex masses @xmath1874 , with @xmath1875 being the fermion excitation number for the @xmath1032th flavor .",
    "while the quantities @xmath1861 and @xmath1876 transform under the @xmath24 s , the central charge itself gives the masses of physical particles , and so must be invariant .",
    "this means that one must also transform the charges as @xmath1877 so that @xmath1878 as we move around singularities and cross cuts in the vacuum moduli space .    in the weak coupling regime , assuming @xmath1879 for further simplicity , @xmath1861 and @xmath1876 are given by @xmath1864 and @xmath1880 .",
    "rewriting the above expression for @xmath1860 in terms of @xmath1683 and @xmath1881 gives @xmath1882 where we have used @xmath1883 . because @xmath1884 is large , the bps mass @xmath1885 is approximately @xmath1886",
    "already we begin to recognize individual contributions to the bps mass from the low - energy dynamics .",
    "the first term is the rest mass of the monopoles .",
    "the last term would be the energy from the center - of - mass electric charge if we could ignore @xmath1887 .",
    "on the other hand , the approximation we have adopted demands that the bare fermion mass is at most of the same order of magnitude as @xmath1888 , which implies that @xmath1889 should be much smaller than @xmath1890 .",
    "the second and third terms are the central charges of the low - energy dynamics , @xmath1891 therefore , the mass formula is approximated by @xmath1892 which relates the central charge , @xmath1043 , of the low - energy dynamics to that of the @xmath4 sym theory .",
    "we will now use the low - energy dynamics developed in the previous chapter to explore the spectrum of states in sym theory .",
    "we will focus in particular on the bps states ; the fact that these preserve some of the supersymmetry of the theory makes them particularly amenable to analysis .",
    "an important motivation for studying these states is to understand the duality symmetries of these theories . as we first noted in sec .",
    "[ om ] , montonen and olive @xcite conjectured that there might be a symmetry that exchanged weak and strong coupling and electric and magnetic charges . in the su(2 )",
    "theory the masses of the elementary charged gauge boson and the monopole are consistent with this duality , but the full multiplet structure of spin states with unit electric or magnetic charge is only invariant when there is @xmath0 supersymmetry .    the existence of dyonic states leads to further requirements .",
    "we have seen that excitation of the u(1 ) gauge zero mode about the unit monopole leads to states whose electric and magnetic charges ( in units of @xmath52 and @xmath45 , respectively ) are @xmath1893 , with @xmath32 any integer .",
    "the montonen - olive duals of these would have to have unit electric charge and multiple magnetic charge , and so should be bound states containing @xmath32 monopoles .",
    "as we will see , not only do these states exist in the @xmath0 sym theory , but they also imply the existence of still further states .",
    "in fact , the montonen and olive duality extends to an sl(2,@xmath1043 ) symmetry that requires states with charges @xmath1894 for all coprime integers @xmath32 and @xmath1895 @xcite    when the gauge group is larger than su(2 ) , duality requires bound states even for the purely magnetic parts of the spectrum . recall that the basic building blocks for the bps states are the fundamental monopoles .",
    "the number of types of these is equal to the rank of the gauge group which , for all groups larger than su(2 ) , is smaller than the number of massive gauge bosons carrying ( positive ) electric - type charges .",
    "thus , for maximally broken su(@xmath210 ) there are @xmath370 fundamental monopoles , but @xmath1896 massive vector mesons .",
    "the extra monopoles required for duality can only arise as bound states . we will show that such bound states exist and are bps , but only in the @xmath0 theory . in the @xmath4 theory there are no corresponding bps bound states and , at least for some ranges of parameters , no such bound states at all .",
    "this is despite the fact that there are classical solutions that might seem to give the duals of the gauge mesons .",
    "although @xmath0 supersymmetry tends to make the spectrum of bps states relatively simple and easy to determine , the explicit construction of these states is rarely trivial and becomes increasingly cumbersome , or even effectively impossible , for larger charges .",
    "however , there are some additional tools that we can use .",
    "some @xmath0 theories can be easily obtained as theories of d3-branes in type iib string theory , as we will discuss in the next chapter . in this approach ,",
    "the @xmath1897 duality of @xmath1898 sym theory follows from the @xmath1897 duality of the type iib theory ; once the latter is accepted as a fact , an @xmath1899-invariant spectrum is automatic .",
    "a more conservative point of view might be to say that the @xmath1897 invariance found in the @xmath0 field theory is strong evidence for the corresponding invariance of the string theory .",
    "either way , the stringy construction allows an easy generalization to a large class of gauge groups and provides easy pictorial hints to novel bps states .",
    "a case in point is the 1/4-bps dyons @xcite , whose existence was first realized in type iib theory @xcite , where these states are constructed by having a web of fundamental strings and d - strings with ends on three or more d3-branes @xcite .",
    "these objects had not been recognized from the field theory approach because the conventional treatment of low - energy monopole dynamics had been based on models with a single adjoint higgs , which necessarily excluded all such-1/4 bps states ,    at the same time , this is not to say that type iib theory is more powerful in counting and isolating precise bps spectra .",
    "it is important to remember that the correspondence between the two theories is not at the classical level , but rather at the quantum level .",
    "just as we must quantize the moduli space dynamics on the field theory side , the string web must also be quantized . in particular",
    ", the moduli space of the string web has little to do with that of the field theory dyons and is , in fact , more difficult to quantize .",
    "thus , the field theory side may give us better control for addressing some of the more precise and specific questions concerning the spectrum .",
    "in the later part of this chapter we will demonstrate the existence and determine the degeneracy of some of the simpler 1/4 bps dyons .",
    "for the case of @xmath4 sym theories , both approaches tend to be more difficult to handle . from the string theory side ,",
    "there are diverse constructions of the gauge theories , but in all of them it is quite nontrivial to find the corresponding bps spectrum . in the elegant formulation of seiberg - witten theory @xcite as a theory of wrapped m5-branes in m - theory @xcite , we know how to realize bps dyons as open membranes .",
    "nevertheless , establishing the existence of a given dyon is all but impossible , except at particular points of the moduli space @xcite . from the field theory side also , the constraints @xcite coming from the seiberg - witten description and s - duality are difficult to analyze beyond the simple rank 1 case of su(2 ) theories @xcite .",
    "the main culprit is the extremely interesting phenomena that the bps spectrum can change as we change the vacuum of the theory along the coulomb phase @xcite .",
    "understanding the spectrum in this approach requires understanding the latter phenomena everywhere on the seiberg - witten vacuum moduli space .",
    "however , even if one managed to understand the structure of the vacuum moduli space completely and explicitly , this would be only the beginning of the problem .",
    "the reason is that this approach is basically a bootstrap where one tries to find a solution to a set of consistency conditions that becomes intractable as the rank of the gauge group increases beyond unity . for practical purposes ,",
    "one typically needs additional input , such as the bps spectrum in some corner of the vacuum moduli space .",
    "an obvious place to look for bps spectra is , of course , the weak coupling regime , which is the main focus of this chapter . in this regard ,",
    "some good news is that the semiclassical approach involving the moduli space description remains more or less manageable @xcite , and does not get significantly worse than in the @xmath0 case .",

    "much of this chapter has been devoted to counting dyonic states that are either 1/4-bps in @xmath0 theories or 1/2-bps in @xmath317 theories . in either case , the bps states in question preserve four supercharges .",
    "we succeeded in counting the dyons made out of a chain of distinct monopoles , and also found that their existence depends sensitively on the choice of the vacuum and the coupling constant .    just as we found in our earlier classical analysis , these dyons are typically loosely bound states of more than one charged particle .",
    "the size of the wave function grows indefinitely as we increase certain electric charges beyond critical values or as we move the vacuum toward some limiting values .",
    "this behavior of a bound state breaking up into two infinitely separated dyons is at the heart of the marginal stability that became familiar from the study of @xmath317 sym theory .",
    "although the same sort of marginal stability mechanism exists for the 1/4-bps dyons in @xmath0 and the usual bps dyons in @xmath317 , there are further subtleties in @xmath4 sym theory . in particular , unlike in @xmath0 sym theory , the existence of a classical bps solution does not guarantee the existence of its quantum counterpart , even when the low - energy effective theory has a mass gap .",
    "the clearest example of this can be found in the @xmath4 pure su(3 ) theory . as we saw in the previous sections ,",
    "a purely magnetic bound state of the two monopoles does not exist as a quantum bound state , even though classically it would be on equal footing with the other two , lighter monopoles .",
    "this absence of the third , heaviest monopole was shown first for the moduli dynamics without a potential energy @xcite and then more recently for the case where a potential energy is present @xcite .",
    "overall , cataloging states with four unbroken supercharges turns out to be a rather difficult task , not only in sym theories , but also in superstring theories .",
    "in fact , the two problems are often closely related .",
    "for instance , if one realizes @xmath4 sym theory as the dynamics of a wrapped m5 brane @xcite , the bps states correspond to supersymmetric open membranes with boundaries circling specific combinations of topological cycles on the wrapped m5 brane @xcite .",
    "if one realizes these theories by calabi - yau compactification of type ii string theories @xcite , the bps states are d - branes completely wrapped on supersymmetric cycles of the calabi - yau manifold .",
    "the problem of finding such states manifests itself in many diverse mathematical forms in string theory , of which we have just mentioned two .",
    "other approaches to this general class of problem have been attempted .",
    "one method involves a worldvolume approach , in which one tries to determine the existence and the degeneracy by studying boundary conformal field theories @xcite or a topological version thereof @xcite . a more geometrical approach led later to an attempt to encase the problem in a new mathematical framework called a `` derived category '' ; for the latter , see refs .",
    "however , these problems remain largely unsolved .    in this respect ,",
    "the counting of bps dyons in this chapter represents one of the most concrete and successful programs we know of .",
    "it is true that our approach here is applicable for only a small corner of the entire landscape of this class of problem , but it is also one where computation can be performed explicitly and with a well - defined approximation procedure .",
    "the hope is that one can eventually find ways to connect our findings to other regimes and find useful information about the behavior of bps spectra in other regimes .",
    "d - branes are nonperturbative objects , found in some string theories , that accommodate the endpoints of open strings @xcite .",
    "a d@xmath702-brane is a d - brane that has @xmath702 spatial dimensions .",
    "a flat , infinitely extended d - brane in @xmath2116 preserves half of the 32 supercharges of the spacetime , so the dynamics of the d - brane itself must respect 16 supercharges .",
    "this fact restricts the possible form of the low - energy dynamics quite severely and naturally gives it a gauge theory structure .",
    "furthermore , a stack of many identical d@xmath702-branes is associated with a yang - mills dynamics with 16 supersymmetries .",
    "a soliton of the sym theory is then transformed into a local deformation of this stack of d@xmath702-branes , and we can `` view '' such solitons by seeing how the d@xmath702-branes are deformed locally .",
    "what makes this representation of the sym theory especially useful for the study of solitons is that there is an alternate picture of these yang - mills solitons in terms of lower dimensional d - branes . for the bps monopoles with which we are concerned , the relevant picture is a segment of d1-brane stretched orthogonally between a pair of d3-branes .",
    "the dynamics of the pair of d3-branes is exactly that of an @xmath0 @xmath2117 sym theory that is spontaneously broken to @xmath1576 by the separation between the two d3-branes .",
    "thus , the motion of the monopole / d1-segment can be described from two completely different viewpoints  either as a trajectory on the moduli space or as a motion in the space of the classical vacua of a ( @xmath2118)-dimensional sym theory compactified on an interval . from the latter viewpoint ,",
    "the nahm equation emerges as the supersymmetric vacuum condition on the ( @xmath2118)-dimensional theory @xcite .",

    "visualizing the shape of the two d3-branes , then , we conclude that the two d3-branes bend themselves and touch each other along the middle hyperplane , @xmath2254 , precisely at the center of the monopole core .    in this gauge ,",
    "the diagonal part of the gauge field satisfies an abelian bianchi identity and must have the profile of a dirac monopole , @xmath2255 in the usual @xmath945 spherical coordinates .",
    "the magnetic flux associated with this long - range abelian gauge field consists of two diagonal fields , @xmath2256 that represent @xmath202 flux flowing from the first brane and flowing into the second brane .",
    "the apparent singularity at the origin is smoothed out by the non - abelian nature of the true gauge field , whose off - diagonal part , @xmath2257 becomes important near the origin but has an exponentially suppressed asymptotic behavior .    for an even clearer picture ,",
    "let us go to the limit where the vev @xmath36 is very large .",
    "the core of the monopole , where the deformation of the d3-brane worldvolume is most pronounced , is small  of order @xmath2258  while the protruding part of the worldvolume becomes elongated along the @xmath2250 direction and is roughly of length @xmath2249 .",
    "this looks like a long thin tube , with a pinched middle point , connecting the two d3-branes , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the pinching of the tube is related to the fact that we can view the asymptotic regions as two d3-branes , rather than as a d3- and an anti - d3-brane .",
    "( without the pinching , the two parallel objects would necessarily have opposite orientations . )",
    "thus , we may view the magnetic monopole as a localized and tubular deformation that connects two parallel d3-branes .",

    "( [ yangmillstopological ] ) gives the topological coupling @xmath2259 which induces a d1-brane charge , coupled minimally to @xmath2260 , on the tube .",
    "since the flux is quantized in units of @xmath202 , the d1-brane charge per unit length along the tube is @xmath2261 which is exactly the charge per unit length of a d1-brane .",
    "thus the tube , if we ignore its girth , looks exactly like a segment of a d1-brane ( or d - string ) stretched between two d3-branes .",
    "the length of the segment is @xmath2262 , the same as the distance between the two d3-branes .",
    "a less precise way of seeing this is to start with the the picture of two d3-branes connected by a d - string segment .",
    "because of the same topological coupling , but seen from the opposite viewpoint , the gauge fields on the d3-branes see the end points of the d - string segment as sources of the @xmath2263 magnetic flux . by itself , this does not show the precise structure of the monopole solution , but it suffices as far as the conserved charge goes @xcite .    this crude picture should be no stranger than our earlier assertion that massive vector mesons are stretched fundamental string segments between a pair of d3-branes @xcite .",
    "the only difference here is that in the weak coupling limit the monopole is a large solitonic object amenable to semiclassical treatment , while the vector meson is small and must be treated quantum mechanically .",
    "if we go to the opposite extreme of very large yang - mills coupling , monopoles will appear very small while vector mesons are very large , so there is no fundamental distinction between a fundamental string segment and a d - string segment .",
    "in ordinary field theories , the interpolation between the weakly coupled and the strong coupled regime is dangerous , but for the case at hand , where we are considering 1/2-bps objects , the large number of supersymmetries protects these pictures .      in the context of this symmetric view of monopoles and vector mesons , the construction of some dyonic states follows naturally .",
    "the trick is to realize that , in addition to the fundamental strings and d - strings , there are other varieties of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional string - like objects , known as @xmath2264 strings .",
    "these are tightly bound states of @xmath551 fundamental strings and @xmath702 d1-branes , with @xmath551 and @xmath702 required to be coprime integers . from the d1-brane viewpoint ,",
    "a @xmath2265 string is nothing but a d1-brane carrying @xmath551 units of quantized electric flux .",
    "when @xmath551 and @xmath702 are coprime integers , @xmath702 d1-branes can not share @xmath551 quantized electric fluxes equally among themselves , and must therefore be at the same location in order to be able to carry such a charge and yet remain supersymmetric .",
    "type iib superstring theory possesses an @xmath1897 duality , similar to that of @xmath0 su(2 ) sym theory , except that it acts on these string - like objects instead of on the charged particles .",
    "the appearance of these additional strings is again a consequence of the @xmath1897 . having a segment of @xmath2264 string ending on a pair of d3-branes generates @xmath551 units of vector meson charge and @xmath702 units of monopole charge , leading to a simple @xmath2264 dyon of the su(2 ) sym theory .",
    "thus , the @xmath1899 of @xmath0 sym theories is a direct consequence of the @xmath1897 of type iib superstring theory . perhaps a more accurate way of phrasing this is to say that the existence of @xmath2264 dyons in the sym theory is important evidence for the @xmath1897 duality of the type iib theory .",
    "at the same time , it is clear that most of the dyons we have found can not be realized in this simple manner .",
    "as we have seen , in a theory with gauge group of rank @xmath1533 , the electric and magnetic charges of a generic dyon do not correspond to parallel vectors in the cartan subalgebra . from the d - brane viewpoint",
    ", such a dyon can not be made from a single @xmath2264 string segment connecting a pair of d3-branes .",
    "instead the desired configuration must involve strings with ends on more than two d3-branes , which is possible for rank 2 and higher gauge groups .",

    "consideration of the energetics alone shows that the location of the junction point is determined solely by the positions of the d3-branes .",
    "each of the three strings has a definite tension , regardless of its length , so the positions of the d3-branes define three attractive force vectors acting on the junction .",

    "for this three - pronged string configuration , the balance of forces is enough to guarantee its bps nature . just as in the field theory computation , these dyons would preserve 1/4 of the @xmath0 supersymmetry .    more generally , we can consider a web of @xmath2264 strings with many junctions and many external ends ending on d3-branes @xcite . with more than three external lines , however , the balance of forces is not enough to guarantee the 1/4-bps property .",
    "we saw from the field theory bps equations that at most two adjoint higgs fields can be involved in the formation of 1/4-bps dyons .",
    "since the adjoint higgs field encodes the configuration of the d3-branes and the strings , this translates to the condition that the string web be planar .",
    "furthermore , the field theory bps equation has only two overall sign choices , one for the primary bps equation and another for the secondary bps equation .",
    "this translates to the condition that the orientation of string segments be consistent with each other .",
    "thus , for example , two @xmath2266 string segments in different parts of the web should be directed the same way .",

    "fundamental strings shoot out from the latter set of d3-branes to meet the d1-brane .",

    "this pattern is uniquely determined by the magnetic and electric charges on the d1-string and by how many fundamental strings come out of each of the d3-branes .",
    "apart from the balancing of forces at each and every junction , the bps condition requires that all fundamental string segments are directed in the same way : all up or all down . while the string web picture is not particularly useful for the counting of states , it proves to be a handy way of cataloging whether a given dyonic state exists . in terms of the restrictions found in the index computations for 1/4-bps dyons in @xmath0 sym theory ,",

    "an open d1-brane acts like a monopole in a d3-brane , a d0-brane can be embedded into a d4-brane and act like an instanton soliton .",
    "not only is this phenomenon of interest on its own but , after t - dualizing the configurations , we will find important implications for monopole physics . in this section , we start with the d0/instanton correspondence , then explain how t - dualization acts on the classical field theory degrees of freedom , and finally arrive at the conclusion that monopoles can be considered as partons of an instanton soliton when the latter is defined on @xmath1044 .",

    "this again matches the known nahm data boundary condition precisely . a mathematical proof , from string theory , of whether and why this generically singular boundary condition is the only consistent choice is still absent as far as we know . a more detailed discussion of the relationship between different nahm data boundary conditions was given in ref .",
