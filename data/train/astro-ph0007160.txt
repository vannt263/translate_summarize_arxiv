    "stars lost from a satellite galaxy in orbit around the milky way will gradually drift ahead or behind their parent system to form streams of debris along its orbit ( tremaine 1993 ; johnston 1998 ) .",
    "assuming we know the phase - space coordinates of the parent satellite , the unique properties of tidal debris streams can be exploited to measure the potential of the milky way in two ways : + * md algorithm : * integrate the satellite s orbit backwards and forwards and try to fit any available observations to the orbit , with the `` best '' potential corresponding to the closest fit ( e.g. , murali & dubinski 1999 ) . + * jzsh algorithm : * integrate the stars and satellite backwards and choose the `` best '' potential to be the one in which most stars recombine with the satellite ( e.g. , johnston et al . 1999 , hereafter jzsh99 ) . + the md algorithm can be applied with limited observations ( e.g. , just angular positions and line - of - sight velocities ) of any accuracy . however , in reality debris in trailing / leading streamers are _ not _ on exactly the same orbit as their parent satellite , but rather in orbits offset in energy from the satellite s orbit by @xmath0 where @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the tidal radius of the satellite , @xmath3 is the galactic potential , @xmath4 is the circular velocity of the milky way and @xmath5 is the _ tidal scale _",
    "@xmath6 where @xmath7 is the satellite s mass and @xmath8 is the mass of the galaxy enclosed within the satellite s orbit .",
    "hence , once the observational errors are small enough to detect the offset of the particles from the satellite s orbit the md algorithm will be biased by this systematic offset , rather than limited by the errors themselves .",
    "in contrast , the jzsh algorithm exploits the fact that debris stars are on orbits with different time periods than the satellite s own and hence will _ only _ work with observations of five of the phase - space coordinates of sufficient accuracy that the offset from the orbit can be detected ( the sixth coordinate , if poorly known , can always be found by applying the principle of energy conservation ) . the dividing line between useful application of these two approaches will therefore occur where the velocity measurement errors @xmath9 satisfy @xmath10    once measurements of proper motions and velocities of debris can be made with accuracies of order 3 - 30 km / s the second approach will be more accurate for all milky way satellites ( depending on the mass and orbit of the satellite  see table 1 ) such accuracies will become possible with the next generation astrometric missions : nasa s space interferometry mission ( sim ) and esa s global astrometric imager for astrophysics ( gaia ) .",
    "jzsh99 have already demonstrated that the jzsh algorithm can in principle recover both the mass and geometry of the milky way with few percent accuracies using just 100 stars . in this paper",
    ", we examine how these uncertainties grow with the limitations likely to be present in a real data set .",
    "we test how well we can recover the milky way potential by `` observing '' debris populations at the end of simulations of satellite destruction and then applying the jzsh algorithm to our data sets .",
    "we illustrate our results in this paper with tests on simulations referred to as models 1/2/3/4 , which had satellite masses 5.1e6/2.9e7/6.9e7/1.0e8 @xmath11 , on orbits with pericenters at 43/43/26/30 kpc and radial time periods of 2.5/2.5/2.0/1.0 gyears .",
    "these parameters corresponded to tidal scales @xmath12 ( see equation [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the simulation technique and galactic model are described in johnston , spergel & hernquist ( 1995 ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to asking how well we can recover the circular velocity of the halo component that was used in the simulations , assuming we know the other parameters in the potential . as an an indication of the error , we attempt to recover @xmath4 from ten data sets , each containing a different group of particles or a different error realization .",
    "we take the `` error '' to be the dispersion in the recovered @xmath4 in units of the true circular velocity ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "* measurement errors of debris stars * as noted in  1 , we expect the jzsh algorithm to require knowledge of velocities such that @xmath14 . to test this , we observed 128 stars in models 1 - 4 .",
    "we then added errors chosen from gaussians of mean zero and dispersions @xmath9 and @xmath15 to each line of sight velocity and each component of proper motion respectively , and ran the jzsh algorithm to recover @xmath4 .",
    "this was repeated 10 times with the same sample of stars ( but different error realizations ) for @xmath16km / s and the dispersion among the results from the 10 realizations calculated .",
    "the errors found , shown in the left hand panel of figure 1 , confirm the intuition outlined in  1 .",
    "* length of tidal streamers * a typical debris star will drift by + @xmath17 in angle away from the satellite in one orbit ( where @xmath18 is the angular velocity of the satellite ) , so a star with separation @xmath19 from the satellite , was most likely lost @xmath20 orbits ago , where @xmath21 to test how the length of the tidal streamer sample might affect the accuracy of the recovered potential we observed 10 random samples of 128 particles in each simulation , with the samples chosen to be within @xmath22 and 180 degrees of the satellite .",
    "the right hand panel of figure 1 plots the results for each simulation as a function of @xmath20 defined from @xmath19 via equation ( 4 ) .",
    "the plot suggests that if we find @xmath23 stars in a streamer we would like to observe them at sufficiently large angle from the satellite to be sensitive to 1 - 2 orbits .",
    "* knowledge of satellite distance * we anticipate knowing the line - of - sight velocity and proper motion of the satellite with a precision at least comparable to those of the debris stars . however , the satellite s distance @xmath24 may be poorly known ( or unknown ) .",
    "this means that though we can expect to place strong limits on the mass distribution in the galaxy , @xmath25 , the physical scale of that distribution will be dependent on our measurement of @xmath24 and uncertain at the same level .    * dynamical friction",
    "* binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) show that the frictional force on a satellite on a circular orbit in an isothermal sphere is given by ( see their equation [ 7.23 ] ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "the change in orbital energy per orbit will be @xmath28 , so @xmath29    * evolution of the galactic potential * the properties of debris trails will also be affected by the time - dependence of the milky way s potential ( e.g. , zhao et al . 1999 ) .",
    "however , the existence of the @xmath30gyear old thin disk suggests that potential evolution has not been significant within the the last @xmath31 orbit of any of the galactic satellites .",

    "table 1 lists the required accuracy of line - of - sight velocity and proper motion measurements of tidal stream stars ( columns 6 and 7 ) , length of tidal stream population ( column 8) and effect of dynamical friction ( column 9 ) for a sample of galactic satellites .",
    "the numbers demonstrate that the necessary measurement accuracies are within the capabilities of sim and gaia and that samples extending tens of degrees along a streamer to select targets will be sufficient .",
    "dynamical friction needs only to be modeled carefully for the innermost satellites .",
