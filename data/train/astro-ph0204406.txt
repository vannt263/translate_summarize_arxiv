    "it is widely accepted that grbs afterglow emission is due to non - thermal radiation mechanisms produced in relativistic shocks , as the ejected matter from a highly energetic explosion expands into the surrounding medium . with current facilities we can observe at photon energies up to 10 kev and",
    "the modeling of the observed lightcurves shows in general a predominance of synchrotron emission over inverse compton scattering on the synchrotron photons .",
    "( panaitescu & kumar 2001 ( thereafter pk01 ) ) . only in one case ,",
    "grb000926 , has a compton component been inferred ( harrison et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this fact sets an upper limit on the density of the medium surrounding the explosion , whose properties can help us to unveil grbs progenitors . in the standard framework",
    "the dynamics of the remnant expansion follows an adiabatic law .",
    "this behavior is expected when the electrons can not cool on the expansion timescale or ( even when they can ) the bulk of the energy remains in relativistic protons and magnetic fields . the post shock magnetic field , necessary for the synchrotron emission , is mainly generated during the shock itself , because the shock compression of the pre - existing field alone would lead to a negligible magnetic energy per particle ( e.g. gruzinov 2001 ) .",
    "the magnetic field is normally assumed to be uniform and its lengthscale to be of the order of the remnant scale .",
    "the electron energy distribution behind the expanding shock front is given by a power law , down to a minimum injection energy .",
    "modeling eight afterglow lightcurves within this framework has resulted in a wide range of density from @xmath0 to @xmath1 @xmath2 , strongly indicating a low density environment ( pk01 ) .",
    "this is inconsistent with other independent observations placing grbs birth in a star forming region : sn bumps in afterglow lightcurves ( e.g. bloom et al .",
    "1999 , lazzati et al 2001 , bloom et al .",
    "2002 ) , metal lines ( antonelli et al 2000 , piro et al 2000 , reeves et al 2002 ) , afterglow localizations close to star forming regions ( bloom , kulkarni , djorgovski 2002 , jaunsen et al 2002 ) and estimations of high density environment from the temporal evolution of external column density ( lazzati & perna 2002 ) .",
    "another remarkable inference from this model is that the fraction of internal energy given to electrons ( @xmath3 ) is always much larger then the fraction given to magnetic field ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this implies that the magnetic field is relatively weak and the compton emission dominates the overall cooling of the electrons .",
    "recently many publications have investigated the somewhat poorly understood generation of magnetic field in strong relativistic collisionless shocks ( e.g. kazimura et al 1998 , gruzinov and waxman 1998 , medvedev & loeb 1999 , gruzinov 2001 ) .",
    "kazimura et al ( 1998 ) found generation of a small - scale quasi - static magnetic field ; similar results were found by gruzinov ( 2001 ) at small simulation times but his longer run shows that the field quickly decays by landau damping ; as a result synchrotron emission could be insignificant .",
    "medvedev & loeb ( 1999 ) found more reassuring results .",
    "relativistic two - stream magnetic instability can , they claim , generate stable randomly oriented strong magnetic field in the plane of the collisionless shock front , so synchrotron emission is possible .",
    "these contradictory results show our ignorance of the possible acceleration process , and of how ( or if ) a stable magnetic field is created there . in the standard model",
    "this ignorance is  parameterized  through @xmath3 and @xmath5 :",
    "the simplistic assumption is made that a persistent magnetic field makes these parameters uniform in space and time .",
    "an observation that maybe suggests a time dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath5 is the independent determination of these parameters in grb 970508 afterglow by wijers and galama ( 1999 ) at 12 days and frail , waxman and kulkarni ( 2000 ) at @xmath6 year : while the former found @xmath7 and @xmath8 the latter inferred @xmath9 .",
    "these uncertainties , coupled with the apparent problems with the standard model , motivate us to explore the consequences for afterglow emission of a different scenario , where the propagation of the magnetic field to large scale is disfavored . in this contest",
    "we particularly focus on the possibility that external density could be larger , keeping the total energy to a reasonable value , without loosing a general agreement with data .",
    "in fact , at this stage , we deal with sparse set of measurements , almost never simultaneous at all wavelengths .",
    "these data can be modeled in different frameworks , ( e.g. grb 970508 ( frail et al 2000 , chevalier & li 2000 ) , grb 980519 ( frail et al 2000b , chevalier & li 1999 ) , grb 000301c ( berger et al 2000 , li & chevalier 2001 ) , grb 991208 ( galama et al 2000 , li & chevalier 2001 and grb 000418 ( berger et al 2001 ) ) .",
    "this analysis is meant to investigate how robust are the current estimation of shock and density parameters .",
    "in this paper we present this more general theory for the grb afterglow emission (  2 ) ; our conclusion (  3 ) is that a qualitative comparison of this model with data suggests the possibility that a shorter magnetic lengthscale can be involved , affecting the estimates of parameters , but only a quantitative modeling of data can give the conclusive answer .",
    "the assumption of a post shock magnetic field persisting during all the expansion time has three main consequences for the synchrotron ( s ) emission and spectrum .",
    "first the emitting region linear dimension is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the expansion time in the lab frame ; this enters in the calculation of the observed peak flux @xmath12 .",
    "then the observed cooling frequency @xmath13 is computed using the lorenz factor , @xmath14 , of the electrons that cool radiatively on a timescale equal to the remnant age .",
    "finally the lengthscale for synchrotron self - absorption has to be compared with the dimension of the fireball in order to compute the observed absorption frequency @xmath15 .",
    "the only break frequency which is not affected by any assumption about the extension of the magnetic field , is the observed peak frequency @xmath16 , corresponding to the minimum random lorentz factor @xmath17 : it depends crucially only on the fractions of internal energy given to electrons , @xmath3 , and given to the magnetic field @xmath4 . throughout the entire emission volume electrons cool also via inverse compton ( ic ) on the synchrotron photons ( self synchrotron compton : ssc ) .",
    "this cooling process dominates the electrons cooling if the compton parameter @xmath18 ( ic and s luminosity ratio ) is greater than one .",
    "this happens if @xmath19 and current estimates find in most objects @xmath20 , ( wijers & galama 1999 , granot et al 1999 , pk01 ) .",
    "if the magnetic field behind the shock persists for an average timescale of @xmath21 , its lengthscale is @xmath22 . in principle",
    "@xmath23 could depend on time , however we do not have any consolidated understanding of this process , therefore for simplicity we will assume throughout this paper that @xmath24 is constant during the afterglow phase . at each time the emitting region",
    "is then divided in two zones ( see fig  [ fig : car ] ) .",
    "the first zone ( region a ) is the layer with dimension @xmath25 just behind the shock front , where there are newly accelerated electrons and magnetic field : here electrons emit via s and ssc ; the second zone ( region b ) of linear dimension @xmath26 , is filled by electrons that have just cooled by s and ssc emissions and that now compton scatter the radiation coming from the first layer .",
    "we suppose that the newly accelerated electrons are advected with the flow ; they produce synchrotron radiation only for a short time ( with a cooling break therefore only at very high energies ) in region a near the shock front and then they emit most of the ic radiation while downstreaming through region b. on the other hand if the electrons diffused freely , so that they could move back into the magnetized region after having lost most of their energy via ic , then the synchrotron spectrum would have a lower - energy break .",
    "this is probably less likely therefore we concentrate on the first case .",
    "the total observed spectrum then results from the sum of region a and region b spectra .",
    "the consequences of @xmath27 on the s spectrum in region a can be derived easily from what we mentioned before .",
    "the observed peak frequency @xmath28 remains unchanged , = _ m , [ eq : num ]    and    ^1/2 = _ m . [ eq : gm ] in our generalized model with @xmath29 we denote quantities by the symbol @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is defined for @xmath32 , ( for the explicit definitions of quantities in the standard model we refer to panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) .",
    "the comoving peak intensity is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are respectively the external density , the magnetic field and the emitting region linear dimension in the comoving frame ; therefore the observed peak flux @xmath37 is smaller than @xmath12 by a factor @xmath38 :    ^3 ( b ) = f_p , [ eq : fp ]    where @xmath39 is the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "since the magnetic field persists for a shorter time , a smaller fraction of electrons cool significantly , before the magnetic field disappears in that region .",

    "the magnetic energy @xmath61 and the compton parameter are higher at the beginning of the afterglow evolution and so the electrons are more likely then to be radiative .",

    "finally the apparent source size , the rate of expansion and the energy in each afterglow should be consistent with observations in the radio wavebands of interstellar scintillation and its quenching ( waxman , kulkarni & frail 1998 ) . in principle",
    "these requirements together with observations of the spectral parameters at a particular time would set limits on @xmath38 and therefore on the structure of the magnetic field generated in shocks .",
    "unfortunately the current data do not allow a model independent estimation of spectral parameters .",
    "actually the spectral shape , and in particular the break frequencies and the peak flux , are not unequivocally constrained by data in even the best studied afterglows ( e.g. grb 970508 , grb 000418 ) .",
    "these spectral features are derived by modeling the sparse measurement collected in various wavebands at different times : very often different versions of the standard model can fit the data , consequently finding different spectral parameters ( see for example berger et al 2000 , for grb 000418 ) .",
    "moreover these model dependent quantities ( above all @xmath113 ) enter with higher dependences than @xmath38 in the estimation of the fireball parameters ( eq .  [ deltae]-[deltaebf ] ) ; therefore the break frequencies and peak flux , derived under the assumption that @xmath32 , can not obviously be used to figure out the value of @xmath38 . these equations and the physical limits on the fireball parameters should be used instead to constrain the overall modeling of data .",
    "the results would actually lead to very interesting conclusions .",
    "if the modeling succeeded in reproducing the data with @xmath29 , a different value for the external density , energy and shock parameters would possibly be derived .",
    "if it indicates a denser environment , this could be more compatible with the strong observational evidence that would place grbs explosions in a star forming region .",
    "however a _ very _ short scale magnetic field ( say @xmath124 ) would be probably ruled out , since extremely high densities would be required in order to get fluxes in the observed ranges and the radio flux ( @xmath125 ) would probably be too heavily absorbed : @xmath126 ( in adiabatic ) and @xmath127 ( in radiative regime ) .",
    "an other implication of the possibility to fit the very same data with models based on different shock physics assumptions is that parameter estimations greatly suffer from shock theory uncertainties . in this work",
    "we have only explored the effect of a short - scale magnetic field , but other reasonable variations of the standard model ( such as time dependent @xmath128 and @xmath129 ) may affect the parameter estimates as well .",
    "this would call for alternative model independent external density and energy estimates in order to constrain , together with the afterglow modeling , the shock physics .",
    "on the other hand if this model can reproduce data only with @xmath32 , it could be either evidence in favor of an extremely stable field or the indication that some other modifications of the theory must be taken into account .",
    "for example , as already mentioned , @xmath38 can vary with time : for instance if the rayleigh - taylor instability occurs at the contact discontinuity , the lengthscale would grow as the fireball evolves and consequently late multibands observations would be more consistent with @xmath32 , while early measurements would require @xmath130 .",
    "observational tests of this possibility can be performed using the theory developed in this work ; in fact we can look for a coherent changing in time of @xmath38 , modeling instantaneous spectra at different times , with all the remaining parameters kept constant .",
    "of , course , with a very good dataset , this approach can be extended to all the other shock parameters , including @xmath131 and @xmath129 .",
    "such a procedure would yield unbiased estimates of shock parameters variability , and the grb afterglow would become a laboratory where shock physic can be tested .",
    "the best case up to now for constraining @xmath38 and its temporal behavior is probably grb 000926 , but in a year swift , rem and and possibly the vla will provide us with more simultaneous data ( also at early times ) in x - ray , optical , infrared and longer wavelengths and therefore more constraining fits will be performed .",
    "this work actually highlights the importance of observing afterglows at all wavelengths , from radio to hard x - ray , but emphasizes as well that current estimations from this data of the external density surrounding @xmath123-ray bursts may depend on uncertain details of shock physics .",

    "<S> in models for gamma ray burst afterglows , it is normally assumed that the external shock strongly amplifies the magnetic field and that this field maintains a steady value throughout the shocked region . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the effects of modifying this ( probably simplistic ) assumption by allowing for a short decay time . </S>",
    "<S> the observations are incompatible with a post - shock field that decays too rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> however if the field pervades only a few percent of the total thickness of the shocked shell ( and the electrons undergo only inverse compton losses in the remainder ) the model could be compatible with data . </S>",
    "<S> this would suggest a strong dependence of model parameters on the uncertainties of shock physics , therefore calling for independent external density estimates . </S>",
    "<S> we claim that afterglow emission should be instead seen as a laboratory where we can understand relativistic shock physics . </S>",
    "<S> the model we propose here together with afterglow observations in all wavebands could help to pin down the field structure .    </S>",
