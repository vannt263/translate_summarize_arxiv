    "numerous theoretical investigations of josephson junctions show that the equilibrium nondecaying current can be expressed in terms of a quasiparticle description based on bogolubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations .",
    "there are two contributions to the current : one is supported by discrete states lying within the superconductor gap ( so called `` bound '' current ) ; and the other , carried by continuum of propagating modes outside the gap ( `` continuum '' current ) .",
    "most authors find the bound contribution from the thermodynamic relation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the free energy of the system and @xmath2 is the superconductor phase difference across the junction , while the continuum one is found from a landauer type consideration which yields a current resulting from imbalance of left - going and right - going quasiparticle fluxes ( it is non - zero in the superconductors ) .",

    "the only significant approximation made in the derivation of this formula is the steplike pair - potential shape : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the junction length .",
    "the applicability of this model was discussed previously @xcite .",
    "the important conditions for applicability of this model are : ( i ) existence of a high barrier on the boundary of the superconducting and normal media .",

    "( [ eq : jos ] ) is the well known bound state current@xcite while the second term represents the continuum contribution .",
    "it requires the knowledge of the dependence of the continuum density of states ( dos ) on @xmath2 .",
    "an important tool , providing this information is krein s theorem@xcite ( see appendix a ) , that connects the change in the dos induced by any scatterer with the corresponding scattering matrix .    using this theorem , beenakker@xcite expressed the continuum contribution via the scattering matrix of the normal electrons in the multichannel case .",
    "we are going to specialize this approach to one - dimension ( 1d ) case developing the simplified expressions for this special case .",
    "below we consider a general junction , consisting of an arbitrary one - dimensional ( 1d ) nonsuperconducting constriction ( barrier ) sandwiched between two superconductors .",
    "the relevant scattering matrix has the dimensions @xmath12 and it can be expressed in terms of the energy - dependent normal electron s - matrix and the scattering amplitudes on the @xmath13 boundaries .",

    "beenakker@xcite , when inserting the fictitious normal metal , demanded that its size is smaller than all lengths in the system except the fermi wavelength , since in this case , he claimed , the normal metal insertion does not affect the results .",
    "this is true in the zero order in @xmath18 ( andreev approximation ) .",
    "some of our calculations are done beyond the andreev approximation , and in this case one must take the length of the normal metal to be shorter than the fermi wavelength .",
    "this would appear meaningless from the physical point of view .",
    "however , we adopt the formal point of view , and consider the `` normal metal '' as a domain in the bdg equation in which the external potential and the order parameter are both zero .",
    "we then can take this domain to be shorter than the fermi wave length .",
    "on the other hand , the scattering formulation is still valid even when the normal - metal length is infinitesimally small because in one dimension the outgoing wavefunction takes its asymptotic form @xmath19 at any distance from the barrier , however small it is , since there are no evanescent modes in the 1d case .    below",
    "we demonstrate that our results for the energy spectrum , persistent currents ( when exist ) , reflection amplitudes etc .  for arbitrary structures with fictitious normal layers agree with the corresponding results for analogous structures without these layers obtained previously using different methods@xcite both under andreev approximation ( appendix b ) and beyond it ( sec .",
    "this is to be expected , since the insertion of the fictitious normal metal corresponds to a non - singular perturbation and it does not influence the results in the limit @xmath17 .    where the andreev approximation is used , it is convenient to set the fermi momentum in the normal and superconducting leads to be equal . in this case",

    "for @xmath58 resonances within the gap there are possible @xmath59 levels , depending on coupling strength .",
    "all these levels can be slightly modified by changing the phase difference between the superconductors , giving rise to the bound state contribution to the josephson current .",

    ", it is proportional to the junction transparency ( [ eq : krich2 ] ) which is of the order of @xmath139 .    the numerical solution for the case of a very low lying resonance ( @xmath137 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sinis5 ] .",
    "it is in a good agreement with the breit  wigner model discussed above .",
    "however , neither the edge state nor the continuum contribution can be neglected when @xmath140 . in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sinis4 ] one edge level is pushed to the continuum ( as in the previous case ) , but the other one contributes and together with the continuum reduces the total current by _ an order of magnitude_. a similar reduction was observed by h.takayanagi ( private communication ) .",
    "the @xmath112 junction represents two coupled normal layers . for a short symmetrical junction without resonances",
    "one can find `` giant currents '' similar to the ones in @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "these are the contributions proportional to the square root of the junction transmission rather than to the transmission itself . however , the current - carrying levels are close to each other and thus they are almost equally populated in equilibrium and the `` giant '' currents strongly compensate each other .",
    "this results in a total current which is approximately equal to @xmath142 a well - known josephson result .",
    "it is interesting to find a structure where the current exceeds this `` standard '' value .    in this section",
    "we present the numerical results for two structures with resonances .",
    "the first one is the short symmetrical @xmath112 with twin resonances .",
    "we have chosen the constriction with one of twin peeks placed within the continuum ( fig .",
    "[ fig - sininis ] ) .",
    "interesting , that the continuum current exceeds the total bound state current and that both discrete and continuum contributions have the _ same _ sign ( they often have opposite signs ) .",
    "the second example ( fig .",
    "[ fig - sininis1 ] ) is the long ( about 3 @xmath143 ) nonsymmetrical junction .",
    "one can see again the strong compensation of individual levels , but the total current exceeds the standard value @xmath144 by about a factor of 2 .",
    "more important , the individual level currents exceed the @xmath145 _ hundreds _ of times and the levels , supporting these currents are split significantly ( @xmath146 )",
    ". thus it may be possible to populate the bound states nonuniformly ( for example by resonant electromagnetic pumping or by coupling to the additional electrode @xcite ) and to enhance the josephson current by order(s ) of magnitude .",
    "in the present work the dc josephson effect was investigated and explicit formulas for josephson current were obtained in 1d case .",
    "we used the approach suggested by i.o.kulik @xcite based on the solution of bogolubov - de gennes equations .",
    "this technique treats the contributions of discrete and continuum energy states separately . unlike the usual way @xcite",
    ", we have not used the landauer - type consideration to find the continuum current , but beenakker s approach allowing to derive both discrete and continuum contributions from the most general thermodynamic relations .",
    "we have also specified the beenakker s idea of spatial separation of the superconductors from the barrier for 1d case and developed it for infinitesimally thin separating layers ( they do not have to be long compared to the fermi wavelength @xmath147 )",
    ". such insertion of fictitious normal layers should be treated as a mathematical trick only , reducing quite complicated josephson problem to andreev reflection @xcite and relatively simple scattering problem of _ normal _ electrons on the barrier .",
    "our results are applicable to a wide class of 1d elements .",
    "the only approximations we used are : ( i)andreev approximation , @xmath148 .",
    "( ii ) existence of a large barrier on the boundary of the superconductor .",
    "( iii ) low current , @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the current density and @xmath9 is the superconducting density ) to be much greater than all characteristic lengths such as coherence length , junction width , etc .",
    "the last two conditions are required to justify the steplike pair potential approximation ( [ eq : step ] ) .    applying our formulas to different junctions",
    "we have appreciated the crucial role of the continuum contribution even in cases where this was not expected .",
    "the continuum current is often neglected in short ( compared to the coherence length ) junctions @xcite , but in some short structures we found that the continuum current can be of order of the bound - state current or even exceed it .",
    "we have found also an unusual enhancement ( rather than decrease ) of the total current by the continuum contribution .",
    "it was found in the paper by wendin and shumeiko that total josephson current might result from almost complete cancellation of huge bound state currents flowing in the opposite directions .",
    "the states supporting these giant currents lie very close to each other , so it is hard to populate them differently and the giant currents are almost canceled .",
    "we found some structures which we believe can be built experimentally , where the level separation is of order of @xmath28 and the individual currents supported by these states exceed the usual josephson value @xmath149 tens or hundreds of times .",
    "we still could not avoid the strong cancellation of individual currents and the equilibrium current is of order of its standard value ( see above ) , and in our best structures it is enhanced by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "we expect that the current in such junctions can be much enhanced by appropriate population of individual bound states ( for example , by microwave pumping or by coupling to another electrode ) .",
    "however , just a large energy separation of andreev states does _ not _ guarantee the lack of cancellation of their contributions .",
    "we benefited from stimulating discussions with b. laikhtman and v. shumeiko .",
    "we also thank e. balkovsky for his kind help .",
    "this work was supported by the israel academy of science and by the german - israeli foundation ( gif ) .",

    "( [ eq : proof ] ) and the analogous relation for @xmath161 .",
    "note that it is _ not _ required to diagonalize both hamiltonians simultaneously . from the definitions of the dos ( [ eq : defro ] ) and the definition of the scattering matrix ( [ eq : s ] ) one obtains @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the free particle dos and @xmath11 is the dos of the scattering problem .",
    "we also used the unitarity of the scattering matrix .",
    "the theorem is valid in both the normal and the superconducting cases , in the latter case one has to treat the corresponding hamiltonians as bcs or bogolubov hamiltonians and to use the superconductor - to - superconductor scattering matrix . noting that @xmath163 is @xmath2 independent ( up to small mesoscopic corrections ) one can calculate the continuum contribution to the current using eqs .",

    "consider the reflection of a quasiparticle from a point `` impurity '' modeled by a @xmath164-function barrier , separated by a distance @xmath14 from an ideal @xmath13 boundary .",
    "more precisely , we use the bogolubov - de gennes @xcite hamiltonian with @xmath165 and @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the heaviside step function . taking into account multiple reflections from the barrier and @xmath168 reflections from ideal ( barrier free ) @xmath13 boundary @xcite",
    "we obtain for incoming electron - like particle @xmath169 where @xmath170 are the total andreev and normal reflection amplitudes , @xmath171 are the barrier reflection and transmission amplitudes for electron and hole , @xmath172 are analogous andreev reflection amplitudes , prime corresponds to the left - going particle .",
    "restricting our consideration to energies of order of @xmath173 and neglecting all @xmath174 terms ( andreev approximation ) we have @xmath175 where @xmath176 . corresponding normal reflection and transmission amplitudes for holes are just the complex conjugated ones for electrons . substituting these quantities to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mar ] ) we obtain @xmath177 this intuitively clear two - step method allows to get the final result more easily than by a direct solution of the matching problem ( @xmath178 linear system ) .",
