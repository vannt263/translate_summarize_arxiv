    "although the standard cosmological model is usually believed to be a correct picture of our universe @xcite it has still some difficulties among which the flatness and horizon problems are most widely known .",
    "the existence of the large - scale structure in the universe extending to the limit of the deepest surveys is another mystery .",
    "its very presence implies the appearance of some seeds for this structure in the early universe . in the standard big - bang scenario",
    "they should be built in , which is rather an undesired feature of the theory .",
    "therefore , so great attention has been paid to inflationary universe models which , albeit invoking an exotic ( if not hypothetical ) physics , were able to provide at least some hope for a consistent explanation of both flatness and horizon problems as well as the origin of seeds for the large - scale structure .",
    "the results of the early universe physics lead us to expect the occurrence of phase transitions when the universe was young , hot , and dense .",
    "the varying speed of light ( vsl ) cosmology , seen as an alternative to the inflation theory , was proposed by moffat @xcite who conjectured that a spontaneous breaking of the local lorentz invariance and diffeomorphism invariance associated with a first order phase - transition can lead to the variation of the speed of light in the early universe .",
    "this idea was revived by albrecht and magueijo @xcite and was given further consideration by barrow @xcite .",
    "barrow showed that the conception of vsl can lead to the solution of flatness , horizon , and monopole problems if the speed of light falls at an appropriate rate .",
    "the dynamics of vsl was widely studied in theoretical as well as empirical contexts @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for the study of vsl models is to seek explanations for some unusual properties of the universe and to overcome some of the shortcomings of inflation scenario @xcite . in particular",
    ", there is an empirical evidence of varying with time the fine structure constant in the context of the consistency of quasar absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "moreover , unlike the inflation the vsl theory provides a solution of the cosmological constant problem .",
    "however , it can not solve the isotropy problem .",
    "it is also interesting to evaluate the power of this model to explain the acceleration problem @xcite .",
    "of course , the vsl model as well as other models discussed in the literature have an ad hoc element ( variable @xmath7 ) not yet firmly founded within any existing physical theories .",
    "this feature does not seems to be so exotic to discard these models from discussion in the scientific community .",
    "some brilliant arguments justifying this approach are given by albrecht and magueijo @xcite .",
    "the varying speed of light models which provide decent fits to the real universe are characterized by the speed of light or gravitational coupling which varies with time in the very early universe but is nearly constant today .",
    "because there are stringent bounds on how fast these constants can vary with time after the first few seconds , the models which dynamics we study in the paper are only relevant in the very early universe .",
    "this should be made very clear by using the phase space approach and its tools for classifying the qualitative types of solutions @xcite .",
    "the present paper is a continuation of previous papers @xcite on the dynamics of vsl cosmology .",
    "we introduce a simple framework which allows to study the dynamics of vsl models in a general way , independent of any specific assumption about the equation of state , or the behaviour of the scale factor @xmath8 near the spatial singularity .",
    "we formulate a vsl friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology as a two - dimensional dynamical system and we discuss its properties on phase portraits where trajectories represent all solutions for all physically admissible initial conditions",
    ". the methods of dynamical systems allow to indicate how the existence of certain desired physical effects depends on the choice of initial conditions and to analyse how these initial conditions determining the corresponding solutions are distributed in the phase space .",
    "our main goal was to perform a global analysis of the dynamics of vsl cosmological models .",
    "we avoid the assumption of power type evolution in the vsl models , which are represented by critical points ( singular solutions ) in the phase space .",
    "we analyse the dynamics of the models on the phase plane and discuss how different trajectories representing non - singular solutions can solve cosmological puzzles .",
    "we conclude that models with the negative curvature and positive cosmological constant are preferred ( in the sense that they have the largest set of initial conditions leading to the solution of flatness and horizon problems ) .    on the other hand we present two arguments which distinguish the frw models with constant velocity of light .",
    "the theoretical one is that the vsl frw models are structurally unstable if @xmath4 and @xmath6 contrary to classical frw models .",
    "the quantum mechanical one is that if a closed universe was born from a quantum fluctuation via the quantum tunnelling process then the most probable universe is that with @xmath9 . in this interval",
    "the potential function preserves its classical character and the universe tunnels from a zero size .",
    "the dynamics of considered cosmological models is reduced to the dynamics of a unit mass particle in one - dimensional potential .",
    "then different physical properties like flatness , horizon and cosmological contant problems can be formulated in terms of the diagram of potential function of the system .",
    "first of all , equations describing a cosmological model should be reduced to the form of a dynamical system @xmath10 in such a way that the solution with a static microspace ( or other solutions of interest ) is a critical point of the system @xmath11 , i.e.  for every @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "if a critical point is non - degenerate , i.e. , at this point all real parts of the eigenvalues @xmath15 of the linearization matrix @xmath16 do not vanish , then there is a one - to - one continuous mapping of a neighbourhood of this point which transforms trajectories of the original system into trajectories of the linearized system @xmath17 in this sense , the qualitative behaviour of the original system is equivalent to the behaviour of its linearized part . if @xmath18 are eigenvectors of the linearization matrix @xmath19 , the solution of the linearized system has , in general , the following form @xmath20 where @xmath21 are constants .",
    "a non - degenerate critical point is called an attracting point if , for all eigenvalues , @xmath22 . in this case , all trajectories from a neighbourhood of this point go to it when @xmath23 .",
    "a non - degenerate critical point is called an repulsing point if , for all eigenvalues , @xmath24 . in this case , all trajectories from a neighbourhood of this point go to it when @xmath25 .",
    "a non - degenerate critical point is said to be an unstable saddle point and if a dynamical system has , at @xmath11 , @xmath26 eigenvalues with positive real parts and @xmath27 eigenvalues with negative real parts @xmath28 .    when investigating the stability of solutions with a static microspace the following theorem proves to be of special interest .",
    "if @xmath29 is a non - degenerate critical point and if the dynamical system has , at @xmath29 , @xmath26 eigenvalues @xmath30 with negative real parts , then there exists ( locally ) an invariant @xmath26-dimensional stable manifold @xmath31 , on which all trajectories of the system go to @xmath29 as @xmath23 .",
    "( a manifold @xmath32 is said to be an invariant manifold of a system if every trajectory passing through a non - degenerate point of @xmath32 lies entirely in @xmath32 ( for @xmath33 ) .",
    "for every such solution , there exists the asymptotic @xmath34^{2 } \\right\\}^{1/2 } = \\alpha_{i}\\ ] ] for a certain @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , if at the critical point @xmath29 the system has @xmath35 eigenvalues with positive real parts then there exists an invariant @xmath35-dimensional unstable manifold @xmath36 on which all trajectories go away from the critical point @xcite .    from the above theorem",
    "follows that , for a saddle point , there are two invariant manifolds @xmath31 and @xmath37 containing this point and filled with trajectories ( separatrices ) going to and going away from the critical point . all other trajectories ( not contained in @xmath31 or in @xmath37 ) do not meet the critical point in question .    for the complete construction of phase portraits in a plane",
    "it is necessary to know how trajectories of dynamical system behave at infinity .",
    "let us take as an example the two - dimensional system @xmath38 in the case of polynomial right - hand sides one usually introduces projective coordinates , eg .",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 or @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "two maps @xmath43 and @xmath44 are equivalent if and only if @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    ". infinitely distant points of @xmath47-plane correspond to a circle @xmath48 which can be covered by two lines @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 . the original system in the projective coordinates @xmath43 and after the time reparametrization @xmath53 assumes the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 and dot denotes differentiation with respect to new time @xmath56 .    on a similar way ,",
    "in the projective coordinates @xmath44 and in the new time @xmath57 we obtain @xmath58 where @xmath59 and dot denotes differentiation with respect to time @xmath60 .",
    "the idea of structural stability was introduced by andronov and pontryagin @xcite . a dynamical system @xmath61 is said to be structurally stable if there exist dynamical systems in the space of all dynamical systems which are close , in the metric sense , to @xmath61 or are topologically equivalent to @xmath61 . instead of finding and analyzing an individual solution of a model ,",
    "a space of all possible solutions is investigated .",
    "a given physical property is believed to be ` realistic ' if it can be attributed to large subsets of models within a space of all possible solutions or if it possesses a certain stability , i.e. , if it is also shared by a slightly perturbed model .",
    "there is a well established opinion among specialists that realistic models should be structurally stable .",
    "what does the structural stability mean in physics ?",
    "the problem is in principle open in higher than 2-dimensional case where according to smale there are large subsets of structurally unstable systems in the space of all dynamical systems @xcite . for 2-dimensional dynamical systems , as in the considered case , the peixoto s theorem says that structurally stable dynamical systems on compact manifolds form open and dense subsets in the space of all dynamical systems on the plane .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to require the model of a real 2-dimensional problem to be structurally stable .    in our further considerations",
    "we will investigate the dynamics of dynamical systems in a finite domain of phase space as well as at infinity . at this point",
    "we would like to recommend the presentation of the actual state of the art in the field of application of the dynamical systems to general relativity @xcite .",
    "albrecht and magueijo @xcite and barrow @xcite set up a useful framework to discuss the vsl models assuming that the time variable @xmath7 should not introduce changes in the curvature terms of the gravitational field equations and that the einstein equations must hold .",
    "because varying @xmath7 breaks the lorentz invariance the vsl cosmology requires a specific reference frame ( including a specific choice of a time coordinate ) in which changes in the field equations are minimal and one postulates it to coincide with the cosmological comoving frame .    in the case of the vsl version of the frw models ( with @xmath62 )",
    "the scale factor obeys the following dynamical equations @xmath63 equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) is called the raychaudhuri equation and from the above system one can build a generalized conservation equation @xmath64 in which time dependence of fundamental constants was taken into account explicitly . alternatively one can think of the raychaudhuri equation together with the generalized conservation equation as of a fundamental system to which equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) is a first integral .",
    "the fundamental difficulty concerning system  ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) is that it is a non - autonomous system with unknown functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in order to be specific in the further analysis",
    "we adopt barrow s power - law ansatz @xmath67 moreover , we assume the hydrodynamical energy - momentum tensor with the equation of state for the non - interacting multifluid @xmath68 where @xmath69 , and energy density @xmath70 .    in the special case of the matter and radiation mixture , the factor @xmath71 depending on the scale factor @xmath2 takes the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "if we substitute @xmath74 into  ( [ eq:5 ] ) then we obtain models filled with single matter and with the equation of state @xmath75 . generally , the equations of state for non - interacting fluids with pressure @xmath76 , the equation of state assumes the form @xmath77 where the factor @xmath78 can be parametrized by the scale factor .",
    "this fact is crucial for the reduction procedure .",
    "power - law ansatz  ( [ eq:4 ] ) turns the field equations back into an autonomous system .",
    "now we can think about extensions of the baseline equations .",
    "one can in a straightforward way include the cosmological constant @xmath79 by introducing pressure @xmath80 and energy density @xmath81 @xmath82 system ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) with the cosmological constant can be cast into form @xmath83 equation ( [ eq:11 ] ) is easy to solve only for the case of @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , in our consideration of the general formulation of dynamics we can not use an explicit form of a solution of equation  ( [ eq:11 ] ) . to avoid this difficulty we consider a special procedure of reduction .",
    "to construct a dynamical system we assume the form of the equation of state @xmath77 and calculate the density @xmath85 using both equation  ( [ eq:8 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) . for simplicity",
    "we focus our attention on the case of @xmath86 corresponding to the vsl model with matter in the multifluid form .",

    "it is characteristic for dynamical systems of general relativity and cosmology that a first integral can be used in constructing a hamiltonian function .",
    "a first integral can be represented as algebraic curves in the phase space .",
    "these algebraic curves are given by @xmath107 and then in the considered case we obtain @xmath108 now if we introduce a new variable , @xmath1 , such that @xmath109 the above relation can be written as @xmath110 where @xmath111 plays the role of the potential with @xmath112 .",

    "it is sufficient to replace the expression @xmath114 in the considered case by @xmath115 .    in the special case of @xmath116",
    "we obtain that @xmath117 and we can use the standard formalism considered in @xcite .",
    "now we can see from formula  ( [ eq:22 ] ) that an algebraic curves on which lie trajectories of the system take the complicated form .",
    "therefore it is useful to visualize them in the phase space . using the form of the above first integral we can also classify all possible solutions by considering a limiting curve @xmath118 and derive the relation @xmath119 as was presented in the classical case @xcite .",
    "there are two kinds of the different methods of reducing equation  ( [ eq:15 ] ) to the form of newtonian equation of motion in a one - dimensional configuration space .",
    "first , after introducing the new rescaled variable @xmath120 , we obtain dynamics in the form @xmath121 .",
