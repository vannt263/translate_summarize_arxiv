    "a natural problem in quantum physics consists in studying the behavior of @xmath0 electrons subject to the interaction with some nuclei , their mutual interaction and the effect of an external potential . in this",
    "setting , a relevant quantity is the ground state energy of the system , which can be found by solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "however , this procedure is computationally very costly even for a small number of electrons ; density functional theory proposes an alternative method to compute the ground state energy and was first introduced by hohenberg and kohn @xcite and then by kohn and sham @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the authors present a mathematical model for the strong interaction limit of density functional theory ; they study the minimal interaction of @xmath0 electrons and the semiclassical limit of dft .",
    "the model is based on monge multimarginal optimal transport ( see also the recent survey @xcite , where the state of the art on this problem is described ) , which consists in the minimization problem @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a given probability measure , @xmath3 $ ] is the coulomb interaction @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the set of admissible transport maps @xmath6 since the cost is symmetric , a natural variant of the monge problem allows only cyclical maps @xmath7 where with @xmath8 we denote the composition of @xmath9 with itself for @xmath10 times . following the standard theory of optimal transport ( see @xcite ) , we also introduce the kantorovich problem @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the set of transport plans @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the projections on the @xmath15-th component for @xmath16 . to every @xmath17-uple of transport maps @xmath18 we canonically associate the transport plan @xmath19 .",
    "as proved in @xcite , if @xmath20 is non - atomic the values of the minimum problems coincide @xmath21    existence of optimal transport plans in @xmath22 follows from a standard compactness and lower semicontinuity argument . in turn ,",
    "existence of optimal maps in @xmath23 is largely open ; it is understood only with @xmath24 marginals in any dimension @xmath25 and in dimension @xmath26 with any number @xmath0 of marginals ( see @xcite and @xcite respectively ) . in a different context ,",
    "optimal cyclical maps as in @xmath27 appear in @xcite for some particular costs generated by vector fields .",
    "as regards uniqueness of optimal symmetric plans with coulomb cost , it holds in dimension @xmath28 , but , as shown in @xcite , it fails in the same class already when we consider spherically symmetric densities in @xmath29 , for any @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , the kantorovich duality works also for this cost ( see @xcite ) and the dual problem admits maximizers ( namely , kantorovich s potentials ) , as shown by de pascale @xcite ; moreover , in @xcite the limit of symmetric optimal plans as @xmath30 is shown to be the infinite product measure of @xmath20 with itself .    beyond the @xmath28-dimensional case , which is well understood , a physically relevant case is given by spherically symmetric densities @xmath20 in @xmath31 , with any number of marginals . in the physics literature , they appear in @xcite to study simple atoms like helium ( @xmath24 ) , litium ( @xmath32 ) , and berillium ( @xmath33 ) . in this case",
    "the problem reduces , thanks to the spherical symmetry , to a problem in @xmath28-dimension , with a more complicated cost function ( see @xcite , where this reduction is rigorously described ) . in the class of admissible transport maps for",
    "problem @xmath27 , seidl , gori giorgi and savin identified some particularly simple maps : roughly speaking , they divide @xmath31 in @xmath0 spherical shells , each containing one electron in average , and consider the transport maps which send each shell onto the next one by a monotonically increasing or decreasing map .",
    "they conjecture the optimality of one of these maps in @xmath27 .    in the following ,",
    "we provide counterexamples to the conjecture showing that there are cases in which none of these maps is optimal in problem @xmath27 . on the other hand ,",
    "we also point out situations where some of these maps satisfy optimality conditions , namely @xmath34-monotonicity .",
    "we deal for simplicity with radial measures in @xmath29 with @xmath35 marginals , although similar examples and computations can be carried out in any dimension and with any number of marginals .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section  [ sec :",
    "e - c ] we present the problem with spherically symmetric data , we recall the notion of @xmath34-monotonicity and a few properties of optimal transport maps , and we give some examples and counterexamples .",

    "we apply these properties to give rigorous proofs of the examples and counterexamples .",
