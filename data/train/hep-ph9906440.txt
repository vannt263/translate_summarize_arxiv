    "repeating that proof here would lead us far beyond the scopes of the present paper .",
    "thus we restrict ourselves just with the statement that with all orders in @xmath101 taken into account , we arrive at the following expression for the vertex @xmath108 of the quark in the external electromagnetic field in the kinematical region ( [ 2 ] ) of large transfer momenta :    @xmath109 \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\alpha_s c_f}{4\\pi } \\ln^2\\rho~\\right ] ~. \\label{quark}\\ ] ]",
    "we have calculated the magnetic form factor of electron and quark in the asymptotical regime where the momentum @xmath110 transferred to the electron or the quark is much greater than their mass .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ quark ] ) that we have obtained predict an exponential fall for the magnetic form factors when @xmath6 increases .",
    "this corresponds to the suppression of non - radiative scattering , without photon bremsstrahlung , at high energies . when the photon bremsstrahlung is taken into account in the dla , in the expressions for such radiative ( inelastic ) form factors eqs .",

    "all the form factors in eqs .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ quark ] ) do not depend on the features of the emitted photons .",
    "it means that taking into account the magnetic formfactor does not violate the poisson energy spectrum for the photon bremsstrahlung in the double logarithmic approximation . on the contrary ,",
    "the inelastic electric form factor that accounts for the gluon bremsstrahlung depends , in the dla , both on the emitted gluon momenta and on the structure of each of the gluon cascades @xcite .",
    "this makes possible to obtain the simple expressions for the inelastic formfactor in qcd only separately for every kinematical region fixed by a certain ordering of the emission energies and angles @xcite .",
