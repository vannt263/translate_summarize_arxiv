    "in the theory of critical phenomena it is usually assumed that a physical system near a continuous phase transition is characterized by a single length scale ( the `` correlation length '' ) in terms of which all other lengths should be measured . when combined with the experimental observation that the correlation length diverges at the phase transition , this simple but strong assumption , known as the scaling hypothesis , leads to the belief that at criticality the system has no characteristic length , and is therefore invariant under scale transformations .",
    "this suggests that all thermodynamic functions at criticality are homogeneous functions , and predicts the appearance of power laws .",
    "it also implies that if one rescales appropriately a critical lattice model , shrinking the lattice spacing to zero , it should be possible to obtain a continuum model , known as the  scaling limit . \"",
    "the scaling limit is not restricted to a lattice and may possess more symmetries than the original model . indeed , the scaling limits of many critical lattice models are believed to be conformally invariant and to correspond to conformal field theories ( cfts ) .",
    "but until recently , such a correspondence was at most heuristic , and was assumed as a starting point by physicists working in cft . the methods of cft themselves proved hard to put into a rigorous mathematical formulation .",
    "the introduction by oded schramm  @xcite of the stochastic / schramm loewner evolution ( sle ) has provided a new powerful and mathematically rigorous tool to study scaling limits of critical lattice models .",
    "thanks to this , in recent years tremendous progress has been made in understanding the conformally invariant nature of the scaling limits of several such models .",
    "while cft focuses on correlation functions of local  operators \" ( e.g. , spin variables in the ising model ) , sle describes the behavior of macroscopic random curves present in these models , such as percolation cluster boundaries . in the scaling limit",
    ", the distribution of such random curves can be uniquely identified thanks to their conformal invariance and a certain  markovian \" property .",
    "there is a one - parameter family of sles , indexed by a positive real number @xmath1 , and they appear to be essentially the only possible candidates for the scaling limits of interfaces of two - dimensional critical systems that are believed to be conformally invariant .",
    "the main power of sle stems from the fact that it allows to compute different quantities ; for example , percolation crossing probabilities and various percolation critical exponents .",
    "therefore , relating the scaling limit of a critical lattice model to sle allows for a rigorous determination of some aspects of the large scale behavior of the lattice model .    in the context of the ising , potts and @xmath2 models ,",
    "an sle curve is believed to describe the scaling limit of a single interface , which can be obtained by imposing special boundary conditions .",
    "a single sle curve is therefore not in itself sufficient to immediately describe the scaling limit of the unconstrained model without boundary conditions in the whole plane ( or in domains with boundary conditions that do not determine a single interface ) , and contains only limited information concerning the connectivity properties of the model .",
    "a more complete description can be obtained in terms of loops , corresponding to the scaling limits of cluster boundaries .",
    "such loops should also be random and have a conformally invariant distribution .",
    "this approach led wendelin werner  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) to the definition of conformal loop ensembles ( cles ) , which are , roughly speaking , random collections of fractal loops with a certain  conformal restriction / renewal property . \" for percolation , a complete proof of the connection with sle , first conjectured by schramm in  @xcite , has recently been given in  @xcite .",
    "the proof relies heavily on the ground breaking result of stas smirnov  @xcite about the existence and conformal invariance of the scaling limit of crossing probabilities ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the last section of this paper explains the main ideas of that proof , highlighting the role of conformal invariance , but without dwelling on the heavy technical details .    as for the ising , potts and @xmath2 models ,",
    "the scaling limit of percolation in the whole plane should be described by a measure on loops , where the loops are closely related to sle curves .",
    "such a description in the case of percolation was presented in  @xcite , where the authors of the present paper constructed a probability measure on collections of fractal conformally invariant loops in the plane ( closely related to a cle ) , arguing that it corresponds to the  full \" scaling limit of critical two - dimensional percolation .",
    "a proof of that statement was subsequently provided in  @xcite .    here",
    ", we will briefly explain how to go from a single sle curve to the full scaling limit , again skipping the technical details , for the case of a jordan domain with  monochromatic \" boundary conditions ( see theorem  [ thm - full - scaling - limit ] ) .",
    "this extends the results presented in  @xcite , where the scaling limit was first taken in the unit disc and then an infinite volume limit was taken in order to obtain the full scaling limit in the whole plane .",
    "moving from the unit disc ( or any convex domain ) to a general jordan domain introduces extra complications that are dealt with using a new argument , developed in  @xcite , that exploits the continuity of cardy s formula  @xcite with respect to changes in the shape of the domain ( see the discussion in sec .  [ sec - convergence - full ] ) .",
    "taking scaling limits in general jordan domains is a necessary step in order to consider  conformal restriction / renewal properties \" as in theorem  [ thm - cle ] below .    using the full scaling limit , one can attempt to understand the geometry of the  near - critical \" scaling limit , where the percolation density tends to the critical one in an appropriate way as the lattice spacing tends to zero .",
    "a heuristic analysis  @xcite based on a natural ansatz leads to a one - parameter family of loop models ( i.e. , probability measures on random collections of loops ) , with the critical full scaling limit corresponding to a particular choice of the parameter .",
    "except for the latter case , these measures are not scale invariant , but are mapped into one another by scale transformations .",
    "this framework can be used to define a renormalization group flow ( under the action of dilations ) , and to describe the scaling limit of related models , such as invasion and dynamical percolation and the minimal spanning tree . in particular",
    ", this analysis helps explain why the scaling limit of the minimal spanning tree may be scale invariant but _ not _ conformally invariant , as first observed numerically by wilson  @xcite .",

    "what needs to be proved is that the limiting distribution is that of the cnl process , independently of the subsequence @xmath154 .",
    "the key to the proof is an algorithmic construction on the lattice which parallels the continuum construction of sec .",
    "[ sec - full ] used to define the cnl process in @xmath42 .",

    "this raises the question of how to define an exploration process and obtain an exploration path in a lattice - domain with monochromatic boundary conditions .",
    "the basic idea is that away from the boundary , the exploration process does not  know \" the boundary conditions . for two given points @xmath119 and @xmath120 on the boundary of a lattice - domain with , say , blue boundary conditions , split the boundary into two arcs , the counterclockwise arc @xmath157 and the the counterclockwise arc @xmath152 .",

    "this amounts to removing the  fattened \" exploration path consisting of the exploration path @xmath164 itself and the hexagons immediately to its right and to its left .",
    "the resulting lattice - jordan subdomains are of four types , which may be usefully thought of in terms of their external boundaries : ( 1 ) those components whose boundary contains both sites in the fattened exploration path and in @xmath165 , the counterclockwise portion between @xmath120 and @xmath119 of the boundary of @xmath163 , ( 2 ) the analogous components with @xmath165 replaced by the other boundary portion @xmath166 , ( 3 ) those components whose boundary only contains yellow hexagons from the fattened exploration path and finally ( 4 ) the analogous components whose boundary only contains blue hexagons from the fattened exploration path .",
    "notice that the components of type  1 are the only ones with mixed ( partly blue and partly yellow ) boundary conditions , while all other components have monochromatic ( blue or yellow ) boundary conditions ; type  1 components are special because we have taken blue boundary conditions on @xmath163 while the exploration path has yellow on its left and blue on its right .",
    "because of the mixed boundary conditions , each lattice subdomain of type  1 must contain an interface between the two boundary points where the color changes .",

    "the zeroth step consists in noticing that the convergence of @xmath359 to @xmath113 as @xmath156 allows us to select a sequence of conformal maps @xmath335 that converge to @xmath329 uniformly in @xmath360 as @xmath156 , which implies that the boundary @xmath361 of @xmath362 converges to the boundary @xmath363 of @xmath364 in the uniform metric on continuous curves ( see corollary  a.2 of  @xcite ) .",

    "it basically allows us to interchange the scaling limit @xmath103 and the process of filling ( which generates hulls ) by declaring that the hull of the limiting curve is the limit of the ( lattice ) hulls .",
    "the proof of the lemma involves extensive use of nontrivial results from percolation theory .",

    "proving the first claim , that for the exploration path @xmath168 in @xmath374 one can interchange the limit @xmath156 ( @xmath375 ) with the process of filling , requires showing two things about the exploration path : ( 1 ) the return of a ( macroscopic ) segment of the path close to an earlier segment ( and away from @xmath361 ) without nearby ( microscopic ) touching does not occur ( probably ) , and ( 2 ) the close approach of a ( macroscopic ) segment of the path to @xmath361 without nearby ( microscopic ) touching either of @xmath361 itself or else of another segment of the path that touches @xmath361 does not occur ( probably ) .",
    "if @xmath374 ( or more accurately , its limit @xmath376 ) were replaced by a convex domain like the unit disk , these could be controlled by known estimates on probabilities of six - arm events in the full plane for ( 1 ) and of three - arm events in the half - plane for ( 2 ) .",
    "but @xmath376 is not in general convex and then the three - arm event argument for ( 2 ) appears to break down .",
    "the replacement in  @xcite is the use of several lemmas in sec .",
    "7 there . basically , these control ( 2 ) by a novel argument about `` mushroom events '' in @xmath376 , which is based on continuity of cardy s formula with respect to changes in @xmath377 . roughly speaking , mushroom events are ones where ( in the limit @xmath156 ) there is a macroscopic monochromatic path in @xmath376 just reaching to @xmath377 , but blocked from it by a macroscopic path in @xmath376 of the other color ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - mushroom ] ) .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite ( see lemma  7.4 there ) that mushroom events can not occur with positive probability while on the other hand they would occur if ( 2 ) were not the case .",
    "the second claim of lemma  [ combined - boundaries ] now follows from smirnov s result on convergence to cardy s formula  @xcite ( see also theorem  3 of  @xcite ) and lemma  [ hull ] .          the next step consists in proving that @xmath387 converges in distribution to @xmath388 .",

    "besides , the convergence in distribution of @xmath389 to @xmath390 implies that we can find versions of @xmath395 and @xmath396 on some probability space @xmath174 such that @xmath397 converges to @xmath398 and @xmath389 converges to @xmath390 for all @xmath177 .",

    "we can now iterate the above arguments @xmath354 times , for any @xmath403 .",
    "if we keep track at each step of the previous ones , this provides the _ joint _ convergence of all the curves and lattice hulls involved at each step .",

    "we note that in this paper we circumvent the use of a  spatial markov property \" that played a role in  @xcite in the @xmath333 limit .",
    "the point is that that property was proved as a consequence of the equidistribution of @xmath404 with @xmath405 and here we apply the equidistribution directly .",
    "it should be noted however that there needs to be some  a priori \" information about @xmath254 to insure that this equidistribution for each @xmath193 implies equidistribution of @xmath254 with @xmath248 .",
