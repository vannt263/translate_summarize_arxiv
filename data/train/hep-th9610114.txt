    "quantum groups  either specialized at roots of unity or not  have been used many times , during the last decade , in the physics of integrable models and in conformal theories @xcite .",
    "the wish of using such mathematical structures , both nice and new , in four - dimensional particle physics has triggered the imagination of many people in the last years .",
    "when @xmath4 is a root of unity , there are other interesting objects besides the quantized enveloping algebra itself : some of its finite dimensional subalgebras or some of its finite dimensional quotients may still carry a hopf algebra structure .",
    "we do not need to mention the importance of finite dimensional classical symmetries in physics , but it is our belief that finite dimensional quantum symmetries will turn out to be also of prime importance in theories of fundamental interactions in this respect , one can already mention the relations between quantum symmetries of graphs @xcite and the classification of conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "such finite dimensional quantum groups are also interesting from the mathematical point of view because they provide examples of finite dimensional hopf algebras which are neither commutative nor co - commutative : they are a kind of direct `` quantum '' generalization of discrete groups ( or , better , generalizations of the corresponding group algebras ) .",
    "these objects are also interesting because of their still not totally understood relations with the theory of modular representations of algebraic groups @xcite@xcite .",
    "the fact that the semi - simple part of a finite dimensional quotient of the quantum algebra @xmath9 , when @xmath4 is a primitive cubic root of unity , has a unitary group equal to @xmath10 suggests that this finite quantum group could have something to do with the standard model of particle physics .",
    "this remark was explicitly made in the framework of non - commutative geometry by connes in @xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "we do not intend , in the present paper , to show how to analyze this finite quantum group along the lines of non - commutative geometry ( for a very detailed account of the standard model ``  la connes '' , not involving quantum groups at all , we refer to the recent papers @xcite or @xcite ) .    in order to make use of a symmetry in physics ,",
    "it is good to be already acquainted with it",
    ". it could be tempting to assume that the reader knows already everything about representation theory of non semi - simple algebras , jacobson radical , quivers , hopf algebras and other niceties belonging to the toolbox of the perfect algebraist but this would amount to assume that nobody can appreciate the beauty of a tetrahedron before being acquainted with the properties of the exceptional lie group @xmath11 .",
    "our point of view is that , since the properties of the algebra @xmath2 can be understood without using anything more sophisticated than basic multiplication or tensor products of matrices as well as elementary calculus involving anti - commuting numbers ( grassmann numbers ) , it is very useful to study them in this way , at least in a first approach .",
    "we therefore want to present in very simple terms the rather nice finite dimensional algebra of quantum symmetries mentioned before , without assuming from the reader any _ a priori _ knowledge on quantum groups , general associative algebras and the like .",
    "we shall therefore define explicitly this finite dimensional quantum group , as the algebra @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the set of @xmath14 matrices over the complex numbers , and where @xmath15 is the grassmann envelope of the associative @xmath16 graded algebra @xmath17 , , the even part of its graded tensor product with a grassmann algebra @xmath1 with two generators .    the motivation and underlying belief is , of course , that there should be some quantum symmetry , hitherto unnoticed , in the standard model , or , maybe , in a modification of it , symmetry that would , ultimately , cast some light on the puzzle of fermionic families and mass matrices .",
    "the present paper is not only a pedagogical exercise : although several properties that we shall describe have been already discussed in the literature ( see in particular @xcite,@xcite ) , usually using a less elementary language , others do not seem to be published .",
    "sections 2 to 5 are supposed to be elementary and self - contained ; the last two sections contain a set of less elementary results and unrelated comments .",
    "finite dimensional quantum groups associated with quantum universal enveloping algebras can be defined for any type of lie group , when the parameter @xmath4 is a primitive root of unity .",
    "it is possible to give an explicit realization  in terms of matrices with complex and grassmanian entries  for the other finite quantum groups of @xmath18 type when @xmath4 is a root of the unity ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "following hopes or claims that such algebras can provide interesting physical models , it seems that there is some need for a paper explaining the basic properties of the simplest non trival quantum group of this type , namely , when @xmath19 .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "construction of a `` generalized '' gauge theory on @xmath2 , along the lines of non commutative geometry , is clearly possible but lies beyond the scope of this article .",
    "let @xmath1 be the grassmann algebra over @xmath21 with two generators , i.e. the linear span of @xmath22 with arbitrary complex coefficients , where the generators satisfy the relations @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this algebra has an even part , generated by @xmath25 and @xmath26 and an odd part generated by @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we call @xmath13 the algebra of @xmath29 matrices over the complex numbers and @xmath30 another copy of this algebra that we grade as follows : a matrix @xmath31 is called even if it is of the type @xmath32 and odd if it is of the type @xmath33 we call @xmath34 the grassmann envelope of @xmath30 which is defined as the even part of the tensor product of @xmath30 and @xmath1 , i.e. the space of matrices @xmath35 matrices @xmath36 with entries @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , that are even grassmann elements ( of the kind @xmath42 ) and entries @xmath43 , @xmath44,@xmath45 , @xmath46 that are odd grassmann elements ( i.e. of the kind @xmath47 ) .",
    "we define @xmath2 as @xmath48 explicitly , @xmath49 all entries besides the @xmath50 s are complex numbers ( the above @xmath51 sign is a direct sum sign : these matrices are @xmath52 matrices written as a direct sum of two blocks of size @xmath14 ) .",
    "it is obvious that this is an associative algebra , with usual matrix multiplication , of dimension @xmath53 ( just count the number of arbitrary parameters ) .",
    "@xmath2 is not semi - simple ( because of the appearance of grassmann numbers in the entries of the matrices ) and its semi - simple part @xmath54 , given by the direct sum of its block - diagonal @xmath50-independent parts is equal to the @xmath55-dimensional algebra @xmath56 .",
    "the radical ( more precisely the jacobson radical ) @xmath57 of @xmath2 is the left - over piece that contains all the grassmann entries , and only the grassmann entries , so that @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath57 has therefore dimension @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a primitive cubic root of unity ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we also set @xmath63 . in order to write generators for @xmath2",
    ", we need to consider @xmath64 matrices that have a @xmath65 block diagonal structure .",
    "we introduce elementary matrices @xmath66 for the @xmath67 part and elementary matrices @xmath68 for the @xmath69 part .",
    "the associative algebra @xmath2 defined previously can be generated by the following three matrices @xmath70 explicitly , one gets @xmath71",
    "@xmath72 @xmath73 performing explicit matrix multiplications or using the relations @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , it is easy to see that the following relations are satisfied : @xmath77 & =   & { k - k^{-1 } \\over \\lambda}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy and straightforward to check that the following @xmath78 matrices @xmath79 are linearly independent and span @xmath2 as vector space over @xmath21 .",
    "this shows that the matrices @xmath80 generate @xmath2 as an algebra .",
    "it is instructive to write these generators in terms of gell mann matrices , pauli matrices and @xmath81 doublets :    let @xmath82 denote the gell mann matrices ( a basis for the lie algebra of @xmath83 ) and @xmath84 denote the pauli matrices ( a basis for the lie algebra of @xmath81 ) .",
    "since we have to use @xmath52 matrices , we call @xmath85 , @xmath86",
    ". therefore @xmath87 , @xmath88 and we set @xmath89",
    ". we shall also need the @xmath81 doublets @xmath90 and @xmath91 one can then rewrite the generators @xmath92 and @xmath93 as follows : @xmath94    before ending this subsection , we want to note that the matrix @xmath95 ( use @xmath96 ) commutes with all elements of @xmath2 . if we set @xmath97 , @xmath98 and let @xmath99 go to zero ( which of course can not be done when @xmath4 is a root of unity ! ) , the expression of @xmath100 formally coincides with the usual casimir operator .",
    "the explicit expression of @xmath100 reads @xmath101    this operator , when acting by left multiplication on the algebra , has two eigenvalues ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) and we see explicitly that the eigenspace @xmath104 associated with eigenvalue @xmath102 is isomorphic with the @xmath105 dimensional space @xmath106 whereas the eigenspace @xmath107 associated with eigenvalue @xmath103 consists only of nilpotent elements and coincides with the @xmath59-dimensional radical @xmath57 already described . in other words , we have @xmath108 and @xmath109 . we obtain in this way another decomposition of @xmath2 as the direct sum of subspaces of dimension @xmath105 , @xmath59 and @xmath110 ( the supplement ) .",
    "it is useful to consider the following matrix : @xmath111 because its square projects on the block @xmath67 of @xmath2 .",
    "the projector is @xmath112 . in the same way ,",
    "it is useful to consider a matrix that projects on the @xmath30 block of @xmath2 .",
    "one can use @xmath113 .",
    "this matrix is not a projector but it nevertheless does the required job since it kills the elements of the upper left block .",
    "indeed ,    @xmath114    the above properties show that @xmath115 .",
    "these two matrices @xmath116 and @xmath117 are very useful since they allow us to express any element of @xmath2 in terms of the generators @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( something that is for instance needed , if one wants to calculate the expression of the coproduct see below for an arbitrary element of @xmath2 , since the coproduct is usually defined on the generators ) .",
    "one can express in this way the @xmath53 elementary matrices ( with or without @xmath50 s ) @xmath118 for illustration only , we give : @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the fact that @xmath2 , defined in this way , admits a non trivial hopf algebra structure in particular a coproduct is absolutely not obvious at first sight .",
    "let us remind the reader that it is the existence of a coproduct that makes possible to consider tensor products of representations , exactly as it were a finite group .",
    "this is obviously of prime importance if one has in mind to find some physical interpretation for @xmath2 and consider `` many body systems '' ( or bound states ) .",
    "for instance , in the case of the rotation group , if @xmath121 denotes the third component of angular momentum , the coproduct reads @xmath122 and this tells us how to calculate the third component of the total angular momentum for a system described by the tensor product of two hilbert spaces , namely @xmath123 .",
    "we now define directly the coproducts , antipode and counit in @xmath2 .",
    "coproduct : : :    we define    @xmath124 ,    @xmath125 ,    @xmath126 ,    @xmath127 .",
    "antipode : : :    the anti - automorphism @xmath128 acts as @xmath129 ,    @xmath130 , @xmath131 ,    @xmath132 , @xmath133 . as    usual , the square of the antipode is an automorphism ( and it is , in    this case , a conjugacy by @xmath134 ,    @xmath135 ) .",
    "co - unit : : :    the co - unit @xmath136 is defined by    @xmath137 , @xmath138 ,    @xmath139 , @xmath140 ,    @xmath141 .",
    "notice that the resulting hopf algebra is neither commutative nor cocommutative .",
    "we now have to check that all expected properties are indeed satisfied . here",
    "are the main required properties for a hopf algebra ( we do not list the usual algebras axioms involving only the multiplication map @xmath142 and we do not list either the axioms involving the antipode ) .",
    "coproduct : : :    @xmath143 counit : : :    @xmath144    @xmath145 connecting axiom : : :    @xmath146 where @xmath147 exchanges the    second and third factors in    @xmath148 .",
    "the reader may check , in an elementary way , that all these properties are indeed satisfied , either by using the above generators and relations or by using the explicit presentation of @xmath2 given before and explicitly performing the tensor products of matrices . for illustration only , we check co - associativity on the generator @xmath149 .",
    "we first compute @xmath150 we then compute @xmath151 both expressions are indeed equal .    to illustrate the non triviality of this result ( the existence of a hopf structure on @xmath2 ) , let us mention , for instance , that the algebra @xmath152 does not even carry any hopf structure at all ( it is known that the only semi - simple hopf algebra of dimension @xmath110 is the commutative group algebra defined by the cyclic group on five letters ) . in our case , the presence of the @xmath67 part is crucial : although @xmath2 can be written as a direct sum of two algebras , namely of @xmath67 and of @xmath153 , the coproduct mixes non trivially the two factors .",
    "if one wants to use this algebra ( or another non co - commutative hopf algebra ) to characterize `` symmetries '' of some physical system for instance in elementary particle physics one should keep in mind that , in contrast with what is done usually in the case of symmetries described by lie algebras , the `` quantum numbers '' will not usually be additive .",
    "our explicit description of the algebra allows one to compute explicitly the coproduct of an arbitrarily chosen element in @xmath2 .",
    "one has first to express the chosen element in terms of the generators @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( for that , one may use @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) .",
    "what is then left to do is a simple calculation using the fundamental property of @xmath154 , namely that it is a homomorphism of algebras : @xmath155 for @xmath156 and @xmath36 in @xmath2 .",
    "warning : with the notations given at the end of section @xmath157 , we see that , for example , @xmath158 , however @xmath159 is _ not _ equal to @xmath160 , .    in order to appreciate the rather non trivial mixing induced by the coproduct , we give  part of  the expression @xmath161 ( recall that @xmath162 is an elementary matrix of `` color type '' , @xmath14 , containing only a @xmath25 in position @xmath163 .",
    "we have re - expressed the result in terms of elementary matrices @xmath66 of color type and @xmath68 of electroweak type .",
    "@xmath164    what is important in this example is not the expression itself ( ! ) but the fact that it involves the @xmath66 _ and _ the @xmath68 . in a sense , one can generate a coupling to the @xmath165 part by building `` bound states '' from the `` color part '' alone",
    ".    we can also compute the expression of the coproduct for a generator of `` electroweak type '' , like @xmath166 with @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "a rather long  but straightforward  calculation leads ( for a two body system , @xmath169 to a rather lengthy result for @xmath170 .",
    "the main feature is that this `` charge '' is not additive : @xmath171 is _ not _ equal to @xmath172 and , moreover , it couples non trivially the @xmath30 part together with the @xmath13 part .",
    "the theory of complex representations of quantum groups at root of unity has been worked out by a number of people . in the case of @xmath173 , see in particular the articles by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the study of representation theory of the finite dimensional algebra @xmath174 was studied by @xcite . since",
    "our attitude , in the present paper , is to study this hopf algebra without making reference to the general theory of quantum groups , we shall not use this last work but describe the representation theory of @xmath2 by using the explicit definition of the algebra given in the first section .    since @xmath2",
    "acts on itself ( for instance from the left ) one may want to consider the problem of decomposition of this representation into irreducible or indecomposable representations ( modules ) .",
    "the problem is solved by considering separately all the columns defining @xmath175 as a matrix algebra over a ring .",
    "we just `` read '' the following three indecomposable representations from the explicit definition of @xmath2 ( the following should be read as `` column vectors '' ) .",
    "first of all we have a three dimensional irreducible representation @xmath176 , ( where @xmath177 are complex numbers ) coming from @xmath13 .",
    "notice that the three columns give equivalent representations .",
    "next we have two reducible indecomposable representations ( also called `` pim s '' for `` projective indecomposable modules '' ) coming from the columns of @xmath153 .",
    "notice that the first two columns give equivalent representations ( that we call @xmath178 ) , and the last column gives the representation @xmath179 .",
    "each of these two pims is of dimension @xmath180 .",
    "@xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "the notation @xmath183 for the three dimensional irreducible representation comes from the fact that , in general algebra , such modules are called `` steinberg modules '' .",
    "the pim s are also called `` principal modules '' .",
    "our notation @xmath179 and @xmath178 refers to the fact that , when expressed in terms of grassmann numbers , @xmath179 and @xmath178 are respectively odd and even .",
    "@xmath179 and @xmath178 , although indecomposable , are not irreducible : submodules ( sub - representations ) are immediately found by requiring stability of the representation spaces under the left multiplication by elements of @xmath2 .    at first sight ( see our modifying comment below ) one obtains immediately the following lattice of submodules for the representations @xmath179 and @xmath178 ( arrows represent inclusions ) :    @xmath184    @xmath185    respectively generated by @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 for @xmath179 and by @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 for @xmath178 .",
    "notice that @xmath194 and that @xmath195 .",
    "@xmath196 ( respectively @xmath197 ) is called the socle of @xmath179 ( respectively of @xmath178 ) .",
    "the module @xmath198 is the radical of @xmath179 and @xmath199 is the radical of @xmath178 .",
    "however , we have forgotten something .",
    "indeed , take @xmath200 , set @xmath201 , define @xmath202 and consider the subspace @xmath203 of @xmath178 spanned by @xmath204 where @xmath205 belong to @xmath21 .",
    "this subspace is clearly invariant under the left action of @xmath2 ; moreover two representations corresponding to different values of @xmath206 are inequivalent .",
    "appearance of such inequivalent representations ( for different values of @xmath206 ) is related to the fact that the group @xmath207 acts by exterior automorphisms on the algebra @xmath2 , since it `` rotates '' the space spanned by @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "multiplying @xmath208 and @xmath209 by a common scalar multiple amounts to change the coefficient @xmath210 so that this family of representations is indeed parameterized by @xmath201 .",
    "the representations @xmath211 and @xmath212 described previously are just two particular members of this family corresponding to the choices @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs for submodules of the `` odd '' module @xmath179 where we define @xmath215    the lattices of submodules of @xmath179 and @xmath178 are therefore given by figure [ fig : lattice ]    @xmath216    since we have a totally explicit description of the algebra and of its lattice of representations , it is easy to continue the analysis and to investigate other properties of @xmath2 illustrating many other general concepts from the study of non semi - simple associative algebras .",
    "one can , for instance , study the projective covers of the different representations ( for completeness sake , this information is represented by dashed lines on figure [ fig : lattice ] ) , the subfactor representations , the quiver of the algebra , its cartan matrix .",
    "this , however , would be a bit technical and more appropriate for a review paper ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we want only to recall that there exists a one - to - one correspondence between irreducible representations of the algebra @xmath2 and the principal modules @xmath183 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "irreducible representations are obtained from these principal modules by factorizing their radical , which amounts to kill the grassmann `` @xmath50 '' variables . from the above",
    ", we see that we obtain in this way three irreducible representations : a representation of dimension @xmath157 , @xmath183 ( it was already irreducible ) which is a triplet for the unitary group @xmath217 of the @xmath13 part of @xmath218 , a representation of dimension @xmath219 , @xmath220 ( the quotient of @xmath178 by its radical ) which is a doublet for the unitary group @xmath221 of the @xmath30 part of @xmath218 , and finally a representation of dimension @xmath25 , @xmath222 ( the quotient of @xmath179 by its radical ) , a @xmath223 singlet .",
    "these are the three irreducible representations corresponding to the quotient @xmath54 of @xmath2 by its jacobson radical : ( namely @xmath224 ) .",
    "the explicit definition given for @xmath2 allows one to compute any tensor products of representations and reduce them .",
    "we have to consider the projective indecomposable representations ( @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 ) together with the irreducible ones ( @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 ) . here",
    "again appears a mixing between @xmath13 and @xmath231 via the coproduct , for instance , @xmath232 .",
    "in this paper , we decided to study properties of @xmath2 without using any _ a priori _ knowledge on quantum groups . here",
    "are nevertheless a few ( non elementary ) facts , given without proof , that may interest the reader .",
    "consider the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath207 , say @xmath156 .",
    "let @xmath233 be the corresponding quantum algebra ( @xmath234 is a deformation parameter ) and @xmath92 , @xmath93 its generators ( not the same as before ! ) .",
    "* the first way to construct the finite dimensional hopf algebra @xmath2 from the infinite dimensional hopf algebra @xmath233 is to divide it by an ideal ( the ideal @xmath235 defined by the relations given in section @xmath157 ) and check that it is also a hopf ideal ( which means that @xmath236 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 ) . + in the usual @xmath233 more precisely in the so called adjoint rational form and when @xmath4 is a cubic root of unity ,",
    "the center is generated not only by the casimir operator but also by the elements @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "it is therefore natural to define new algebras by dividing the ` big ' object @xmath233 by an ideal generated by relations of the kind we just considered ( remember that @xmath241 in @xmath2 ) .",
    "actually , one could as well define new algebras by imposing relations of the kind @xmath242 and @xmath243 for integers @xmath244 and @xmath210 that are divisible by @xmath157 ( the value of the right hand side , namely @xmath245 or @xmath25 is fixed by the existence of a co - unit ) .",
    "the finite dimensional quotient @xmath2 therefore appears as a `` minimal '' choice . as a matter of fact , even at the level of @xmath2 , defined as before , and without any reference to @xmath233 , it is convenient to introduce an invertible square root @xmath246 for @xmath93 , hence @xmath247 . in this way , one obtains a new algebra @xmath248 of dimension @xmath249  just count the number of independent monomials @xmath250 when @xmath251 and @xmath252 ( this is a pbw basis ) .",
    "this algebra is quite interesting because its list of representations contains not only those of @xmath2 but also `` charge conjugate '' representations .",
    "one can also justify , for the quantum enveloping algebra itself , and whether @xmath4 is a root of unity or not , the interest of adding a square root to the generator @xmath93 .",
    "introducing such a square root at the level of @xmath233 defines the the so - called simply - connected rational form of the quantum universal enveloping algebra .",
    "the reader should be warned that the algebra @xmath2 or @xmath248 is sometimes denoted by @xmath253 with a small @xmath254 and called the `` restricted quantum universal algebra '' ( for a reason that will be explained below ) , but the terminology is not established yet and one should always look which of @xmath240 or @xmath255 is equal to @xmath25 ; for instance , our @xmath256 see above coincide with the @xmath93 of @xcite .",
    "* there exists another construction which is more tricky but maybe more profound .",
    "let us start with the following simple observation .",
    "consider the algebra of polynomials with one unknown @xmath257 , _ over the rational numbers _ ; it can be considered as an algebra generated by the @xmath258 ( to be identified with the powers of @xmath257 ) with relations @xmath259 .",
    "one can make a change of generators , define the divided powers @xmath260}\\doteq x^i / i!$ ] so that @xmath260 } x^{[j]}=\\frac { ( i+j)!}{i ! j ! } x^{[i+j]}$ ] and define the very same algebra by using the new generators @xmath260}$ ] and the new relations .",
    "the tricky point is that , if we now decide to build an algebra over the finite field @xmath261 ( for instance @xmath262 ) by taking reduction of coefficients modulo @xmath263 , the two constructions , with usual powers and divided powers , will lead to two different algebras .",
    "for instance , the relation @xmath264 will be valid in the first algebra ( the r.h.s .",
    "is non zero ) whereas we obtain @xmath265}x^{[2]}=\\frac { 3!}{1 ! 2 ! } x^{[3 ] } = 0 $ ] if we use divided powers , since @xmath266 in @xmath267 .",
    "a similar phenomenon appears , in the case of quantum groups when @xmath4 is a primitive root of unity .",
    "there are indeed two ways of specializing the @xmath4 of @xmath233 ( see for instance @xcite ) to a particular complex value @xmath136 .",
    "one can use the usual ( @xmath4-deformed ) generators and relations , but one can also use @xmath4-deformed divided powers and corresponding relations ( these relations contain @xmath4-deformed factorials on the right hand side ) . for generic values of @xmath4 ,",
    "both definitions lead to the same algebra , but when @xmath4 is a primitive root of unity , the algebras are different .",
    "more precisely , we are interested here in the `` restricted integral form '' , called @xmath268 which is obtained as follows .",
    "we assume that @xmath269 , with @xmath270 , and start with @xmath271 considered as an algebra over the cyclotomic field @xmath272 ( it is obtained by adjoining a cubic root of unity to the field @xmath273 of rational numbers ) .",

    "this embedding , obtained by using    properties of powers of quantum matrices is an embedding of algebra    but not of coalgebras ; this can be seen as follows ( we compare    @xmath379 and @xmath380 ) : the coproduct on the algebra spanned by the    coordinate functions @xmath381 generating    @xmath382 reads , when applied to the    generator @xmath383 ,    @xmath384 , . since    @xmath154 is an algebra homomorphism    @xmath385 @xmath386 ,    whereas the hopf algebra @xmath387    has _ another",
