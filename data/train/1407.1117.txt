    "study of the ultracold atomic gases have been made many progresses in many - body quantum theory through the bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite , two boson mixtures @xcite , degenerate atomic fermi gases @xcite , and bose - fermi ( bf ) mixing gases @xcite .",
    "in particular , the bf mixtures , a typical example in which particles obeying different quantum statistics are intermingled , attract physical interest to obtain new knowledge of many - body quantum systems because of a large variety of combinations of atomic species and controllability of the atomic interactions using the feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "a variety of theoretical studies have been done on the bf mixtures : static properties @xcite , phase diagrams and phase separation phenomena @xcite , instability @xcite and collective excitations @xcite .",
    "the researches on the trapped atomic gases of the yb isotopes have been performed by kyoto university group : the bec @xcite and the fermi - degeneracy @xcite .",
    "they also succeeded in realizing the bf mixtures of the isotopes .",
    "the yb consists of many kinds of isotopes five bosons ( @xmath0yb ) and two fermions ( @xmath1yb ) , which give a variety of combinations in the bf mixtures .",
    "the scattering lengths of the boson - fermion interactions have been determined experimentally by the group @xcite , and the experimental studies of the ground state properties and the collective oscillations of the bf mixtures is now under progressing .",
    "in many characteristic properties , the spectrum of the collective excitations is an important diagnostic signal of these systems ; they commonly appear in many - particle systems and are often sensitive to the inter - particle interaction and the structure of the ground and excited states . using a dynamical approach to solve time - developments of the oscillation states with the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( tdgp ) and vlasov equations , we have studied the monopole @xcite , dipole @xcite and quadrupole @xcite oscillations of the bf mixtures in the spherical traps and the breathing oscillations in the largely prolate deformed system @xcite . in these works , we found that the oscillational motions of the bf mixtures include various modes , and that , though the intrinsic frequencies are somewhat different from those in the sum - rule @xcite , the dynamical calculations give consistent results with the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite in the early stage of time development .",
    "the oscillations are decoupled into the longitudinal and transverse oscillation modes in the largely prolate deformed system , and into the monopole and quadrupole oscillation modes in the completely spherical system .",
    "however , the mixing behavior of these modes is not known in the deformed region between the above two extreme conditions .",
    "we studied the deformation dependence of breathing oscillations in the two - component fermi gases using the scaling approach@xcite , and found that the breathing oscillations can be described as superpositions of the four oscillation modes : the longitudinal and transverse oscillations with in - phase and out - of - phase@xcite . in the aspect of the mixing of these modes ,",
    "the characteristic mixing behaviors for the breathing oscillations are found in the oblate , spherical and prolate traps , respectively .    in bf mixtures",
    ", it should be noted that the in - phase and out - of - phase oscillations are not intrinsic modes in oscillations because the two components obey different statistics .",
    "thus , the bf mixtures are expected to show different behaviors in the mode mixing and resonances at the level crossing points from the two - component fermi gases .    in this work ,",
    "then , we investigate the deformation dependence in the breathing oscillations of the bf mixtures by examining mixing properties of the longitudinal and transverse oscillations . for this purpose",
    "we use the scaling approach , which is an approximation of the rpa @xcite , and describe collective oscillations with macroscopic picture .",
    "this method have reproduced the intrinsic frequencies of the bf breathing oscillations calculated in the time - dependent simulation @xcite , and can clearly demonstrate the mixing properties ,    though this scaling method is thought to describe the collective oscillations within the linear response regime , the nonlinear calculation was applied to the oscillations of bec @xcite , which reproduced the experimental results by ref .",
    "@xcite very well . also , the method was used in the study of the oscillations of non - condensed bose gases @xcite and the quasi - low dimension gases @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we give a brief explanation of the scaling method and discuss the mixing of the boson and fermion oscillations in extreme conditions . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the results in various deformed traps in the scaling method . in sec .",
    "iv , we compare the collective oscillation modes obtained in the scaling method < with those in the dynamical approach based on the tdgp+vlasov equation . the summary of the present work is given in sec .",
    "let s consider the oscillation behaviors of the mixture in the deformed system , and take up the collective modes from the macroscopic point of view .    in order to calculate the oscillation modes",
    ", we use the scaling method , for which we only give a brief explanation , so that , for the details , the readers should consult the previous paper .",

    "we should comment that the dynamical calculations give consistent results with the rpa and its approximation like the scaling method in early stage of time development .",

    "thus , the bf mixtures show new dynamical properties different from the other kinds of finite many - body system such as atomic nuclei .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the deformation dependence of the breathing oscillations in the boson - fermion mixture .",
    "the deformation regions are classified into the prolate , semi - spherical and oblate ones . in each region , the four kinds of oscillations with different mixing characters , the blb , btb , flb and ftb modes , appear ; around the borders of these regions , the level - crossing phenomena between the btb and flb and between the btb and flb modes occurs .",
    "this classification based on the deformation of the system should be useful for experimentalists in the observation of these breathing oscillations and/or related phenomena .",
    "furthermore , the oscillation behaviors become complicated in the region between the largely deformed and spherical shapes , and the drastic changes occur at the level crossing points ; the resonant oscillations should appear at the level crossing points .",
    "these variations of the oscillational behaviors are clearly seen in the case of the strong boson - fermion attractive interaction ( @xmath222 ) , and the mixtures of the large boson number ( @xmath97 ) , where the boson - dominant approximation is available .",
    "when @xmath97 , the oscillation states are mainly classified into two kinds : boson - fermion co - moving modes and fermion - dominant oscillation modes .",
    "the co - moving oscillation modes are actually the boson dominant oscillation with the forced - oscillation of fermions ; the frequencies of the boson and fermion oscillations are the same .    in the time - dependent simulations @xcite ,",
    "the fermionic intrinsic oscillations show rapid damping , and , particularly when @xmath223 , their amplitudes are negligibly small .",
    "the strength of the fermion intrinsic oscillation is separated into the two oscillation modes corresponding to fermion motions inside and outside of the boson populate region ; @xcite : these behaviors can not be described with the scaling method . when the bf - interaction is repulsive , large part of fermions populate outside of the boson region , and , when @xmath171 , the fermions outside the boson region dominate .",
    "thus , the fermion dominant oscillation do not exist in long period , and we can not easily observe these modes in actual experiments .    on the other hand , the boson - fermion co - moving oscillations can be easily observed in experiments .",
    "indeed , the blb oscillations have been found in the actual experiments @xcite , which showed the 1.2% increase of its frequency when the bf coupling is varied from @xmath224 to @xmath225 . in this experiment , because of the strongly - repulsive bf interaction , the fermion contribution should be small . in the case of the strongly - attractive bf interaction ( @xmath215 ) , however , we can observe larger effects of the deformation in the oscillation behaviors , and find that the clear differences between the spherical and non - spherical oscillations .",
    "the bf mixtures of the strongly - attractive bf interactions also show the oscillation behaviors caused by the fermion - gas expansion @xcite .",
