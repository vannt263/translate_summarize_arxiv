    "we assume a tevatron integrated luminosity equal to 1 fb@xmath130 or 10 fb@xmath130 .",
    "we assume the _ same _ integrated luminosity for each polarization and for the unpolarized case .",
    "then we obtain the results in table 2.3 , for the experimental limits that could be set on the two anomalous couplings .",
    "we emphasize that the numbers in table 2.3 do not include possible experimental uncertainties ; our purpose in estimating the limits that could be placed on @xmath109 and @xmath20 is only to compare the precision from polarized or unpolarized protons .",
    "the left - polarized proton provides a better limit on @xmath109 or @xmath20 , because it has a larger cross - section .",
    "the improvement in precision from left - polarized protons , compared to unpolarized , is not very great , because @xmath116 is only about 1.5 times larger than @xmath131 , and because the precision on @xmath121 is only proportional to @xmath132 .",

    "i.e. _ the parameters @xmath152 . in this section",

    "therefore , as explained further below , we approximate the cross - section by @xmath1 production .",
    "the cross - sections for @xmath153 and @xmath154 final states are equal in this approximation , because either @xmath2 is equally likely to decay leptonically .",
    "a related process is @xmath155 production , where the @xmath12 decays to 2 jets , _",
    "@xmath156 in our calculations we ignore the @xmath155 production . in a theoretical calculation",
    "the @xmath1 production is distinguishable from the @xmath155 production .",
    "however , in an experiment these two processes are tangled together , because they are both observed as @xmath157 . in our @xmath1 calculation",
    "we impose a kinematic cut on the invariant mass @xmath158 of the 2 jets , making @xmath158 approximately equal to the @xmath38 mass ; specifically we take @xmath158 between 70 and 90 gev .",
    "( this cut reduces the qcd background of @xmath159 . ) but even with this cut on @xmath158 there would still be an overlap between @xmath1 production and @xmath155 production .",
    "the purpose of our calculation is a theoretical study of the effect of proton polarization on the cross - section .",
    "a complete analysis of experimental data would need to include both the @xmath1 and @xmath155 processes together .",
    "the method of calculation is similar to sec .  2 , but with some differences .",
    "in sec .  2",
    "only one parton helicity combination contributes , @xmath160 . here",
    "two helicity combinations contribute , for example @xmath161 and @xmath162 , and we include both .",
    "in fact , for standard couplings the contribution from @xmath162 is very small compared to @xmath161 , because of interference between feynman diagrams , so the parton - level process still depends strongly on quark helicities .",
    "a more important difference is that in sec .",
    "ii there was no parton - level background process , whereas here we have a large background from electroweak+qcd processes .",
    "* a. background , approximations , and cuts *    the parton - level background to this process is the production of @xmath159 by processes with one electroweak vertex and one qcd vertex .",
    "these processes do not interfere quantum mechanically with our doubly electroweak signal process , because they have a different color structure ; for example , the @xmath163 vertex is color octet , where @xmath164 denotes the gluon , whereas @xmath165 or @xmath166 vertices are color singlet .",
    "however the final states are indistinguishable experimentally , so the doubly electroweak reaction is hidden in a background of electroweak - qcd reactions .",
    "we have calculated the background cross - section from the helicity amplitudes for a complete set of @xmath157 processes @xcite , with the polarized parton distribution functions described in sec .  1 .",
    "the background reactions should depend strongly on the helicity of the proton : the produced @xmath38 must connect to a left - handed quark or right - handed antiquark for massless quarks , by the v@xmath40a coupling ; the density of quarks of given helicity depends on the helicity of the proton .",
    "by contrast , for the signal reaction the diagrams _ with anomalous @xmath5 or @xmath6 vertices _ do not require any specific helicities of the incoming quarks .",
    "thus the signal reaction will have a different dependence on proton helicity than the background .",
    "the important question is whether the signal - to - background ratio in the measurement of anomalous @xmath27 couplings is better for left- or right - polarized protons .    to reduce the background we impose a cut on the invariant mass @xmath158 of the 2 jets , putting @xmath158 approximately equal to @xmath68 .",

    "furthermore , we _ require _ the @xmath170 invariant mass to be approximately equal to the @xmath38 mass : we calculate the cross - section only for events with @xmath171 between 70 and 90 gev .",

    "this figure shows why large-@xmath179 is interesting : the signal - to - background ratio is larger , and the dependence on @xmath3 and @xmath4 is stronger , for large @xmath179 .",
    "figure 3.6 compares signal and background for @xmath180 . on the other hand ,",
    "this energy cut reduces drastically the total number of events , so it becomes a question of detailed calculation to see whether it is a real advantage , given the available luminosity .",
    "our calculation is for @xmath169 tev .",
    "a @xmath7 collider with higher center - of - mass energy would produce more events in the interesting region of phase space with large @xmath179 , and provide stronger tests of the anomalous @xmath27 couplings .",
    "it is difficult to determine @xmath179 accurately in an experimental event , because that requires measurement of jet momenta and missing neutrino momentum .",

    "one way to choose @xmath182 is to select the solution with smaller absolute value , because a hard scattering process tends to produce final products in the central radidity region with large transverse momenta .",
    "given @xmath182 it is straightforward to calculate @xmath179 from the 4-momenta of @xmath184 and the 2 jets .",

    "the cross - section includes the branching ratio 2/9 for leptonic decay of one @xmath2 ( into either electron or muon plus neutrino ) .",

    "figures 3.7 to 3.9 show the results as plots of signal cross - section _ vs _ anomalous coupling parameters .",

    "we need to compare the signal cross - section to the qcd background cross - section .",
    "we may consider the background for either @xmath76 or @xmath11 production , and then choose the @xmath2 charge that has the smaller background cross - section .",
    "for _ polarized _ protons , the background cross - sections for @xmath76 or @xmath11 production are different .",
    "for instance , for a left - handed proton the background process @xmath191 has a larger rate than @xmath192 , because the probability of finding @xmath193 ( which produces @xmath76 ) inside @xmath194 is larger than @xmath195 ( which produces @xmath11 ) , as implied by fig .",
    "1.1 ; @xmath196 and @xmath197 do not contribute to the constituent cross - section of the @xmath157 background process because the weak charged current is left - handed .",

    "( for _ unpolarized _ scattering the production rates of @xmath76 and @xmath11 are equal by cp invariance ; but for scattering of polarized protons on unpolarized antiprotons , cp invariance does not apply . )",
    "since the signal process is symmetric with respect to the charge of the @xmath2 that decays leptonically , the process with the smaller background has a better signal - to - background ratio .",
    "hereafter we apply this strategy when comparing signal and background rates in the tables .",

    "* d. interpretation of the results *    the limits described above show how this process , @xmath1 production with polarized protons , tests the @xmath27 vertex . the estimated limits on anomalous couplings include only simple statistical uncertainty , based on poisson statistics ( @xmath208 ) ; they do not include experimental uncertainty due to detector inefficiency or theoretical uncertainty of parton distribution functions or @xmath58 scale .",
    "for example , the background calculation depends on the choice of parton momentum scale @xmath58 .",
    "table 3.8 shows how the background cross - section , for unpolarized scattering , depends on the choice of @xmath58 .",
    "we used @xmath185 in our calculations .",
    "@xmath219 or @xmath220 would also be reasonable choices .",
    "the cross - sections for the three choices differ by about 20% . this theoretical uncertainty due to dependence on scale choice is larger than the statistical uncertainty analysed above .",
    "it is thus difficult to extract the signal cross - section unless the uncertainty in the background cross - section is reduced , by including higher - order qcd effects to reduce the dependence on @xmath58 scale . on the other hand ,",
    "given large luminosity the details of the qcd background processes , _",
    "e.g. _ the shapes of @xmath179 distributions , can be measured directly from data to discriminate between different theoretical predictions from different scale choices .",
    "therefore we anticipate that background rates will eventually be better known , and allow us to extract signal rates .",
    "our purpose in this work is to study the effect of proton polarization . for this study",
    "we have analysed only the _ total cross - section _ as a function of @xmath221 and @xmath4 .",
    "stronger constraints on @xmath221 and @xmath4 may be set by analysing differential cross - sections , with respect to variables for which the distribution of events is sensitive to @xmath221 or @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to find kinematic variables _ dependent on proton helicity _ for which the distribution of events is sensitive to @xmath221 or @xmath4 , to further test the triple - boson couplings with polarized proton scattering .",
    "we have studied the potential of a polarized proton beam at the tevatron collider for measuring the tri - boson couplings @xmath5 and @xmath6 . because the polarized parton distribution functions in the relevant kinematic region ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath48-values ) are not yet precise enough to give definite detailed predictions about the rates of the signal and the backgrounds , we have concentrated on the comparisons between the total event rates from a polarized- and an unpolarized- proton beam . as summarized in tables 2.3 , 3.6 and 3.7 , we found that with a polarized proton beam the limits on non - standard parameters @xmath222 , @xmath75 , @xmath223 and @xmath224 are somewhat improved compared to those obtained from an unpolarized proton beam .",
    "we anticipate that these results can be further improved by studying detailed distributions of relevant kinematic variables .",
    "generally a factor of 2 improvement in measuring these non - standard parameters is expected , after selecting kinematic regions where the signal becomes more important , as illustrated in tables 3.6 and 3.7 .",
    "reliable predictions of distributions of kinematic variables will require more precise polarized parton distribution functions .",
    "measurements of polarized proton - antiproton reactions , such as single-@xmath38 production with a polarized proton beam , will yield new information on spin - dependent parton distributions .",
    "thus the use of polarized scattering to test fundamental physics , and the determination of the spin structure of the proton , would proceed together .",
    "one interesting feature that we found about the polarized collider program is that it is possible to select the polarization state of the proton beam to enhance the ratio of signal to background for a specific charge mode of the final state .",
    "this was demonstrated in studying the process @xmath225 .",
    "for the final state with a positive charged lepton ( @xmath226 ) , one can select the polarization of the proton beam to be right - handed to improve the signal - to - background ratio because the qcd background process @xmath227 has a smaller rate than @xmath228 .",
    "the signal rate , in contrast , is independent of the charge mode of the isolated lepton from the @xmath2-boson decay because either @xmath229 or @xmath230 can decay into the charged lepton .",
    "we expect that similar tricks can be applied to other polarized physics measurements , such as the @xmath231 mode of the @xmath232 pair production from @xmath233 and @xmath234 fusion processes .",
