    "in the study of compressible fluid flows , the thermodynamical ( gibbs ) relation @xmath0 has always the fundamental importance , where @xmath1 is the temperature , @xmath2 is the entropy , @xmath3 is the internal energy , @xmath4 is the pressure and @xmath5 is the density . in general ,",
    "the internal energy includes the static energy , chemical energy in the field of combustion , and stress tensor in elasticity etc .",
    "this relation distinguishes compressible fluid flows from incompressible fluid ones .",
    "the more compressible the flows are , the more dominant role it needs to play .",
    "this feature should be manifested in the design of numerical methods in order to guarantee resulting numerical solutions obey the same or at least an approximate analogue .",
    "let us recall the ( first order ) godunov scheme @xcite for inviscid compressible euler equations to roughly inspect how the thermodynamics works for numerical methods since it is the reference of any first order numerical schemes and has become the foundation of modern cfd .",
    "the godunov scheme assumes , as most first order finite volume schemes do , that the physical state is uniform over each computational cell at each time step and the flow variation is described through the jumps of states across neighboring cell boundaries .",
    "the cellwise uniformity of the initial data implies that the resulting rarefaction waves emanating from the jumps are always isentropic .",
    "moreover , the local self - similarity of the solution implies that the entropy is constant along each cell boundary .",
    "it turns out that no thermodynamical process is included in numerical fluxes .",
    "it does not matter if the thermodynamical effect is weak and the dynamical process is not severe , just as exhibited in many popular numerical examples in literature , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , once the thermodynamical process becomes significant , an effective numerical scheme has to include the thermodynamical variation .",
    "otherwise , it might have some defects , as shown in @xcite for the problem of large ratio of density or pressure .",
    "this is insurmountable in the framework of first order schemes or higher order accurate schemes when first order numerical flux ( riemann , approximate riemann ) solvers are adopted .    in this paper",
    ", we will demonstrate how the thermodynamical effect is integrated into high order accurate numerical schemes through the study of the generalized riemann problem ( grp ) .",
    "given piecewise polynomials of high degree as initial data , all waves from the initial jumps at cell boundaries are curved and in particular rarefaction waves are no longer isentropic .",
    "the initial entropy variation activates the interaction between the kinematical and thermodynamical quantities .",
    "as the waves are sufficiently strong , the interaction can not be neglected and the entropy variation should be plugged into numerical fluxes in order to precisely characterize the thermodynamical process , as described in the grp approach in @xcite .",
    "we recognize by careful inspection on the resolution of the grp that the thermodynamical quantities play a fundamental role in the following sense :    1 .",
    "the expansion of waves can be characterized in terms of local sound speed alone ; 2 .",
    "the entropy variation rate across rarefaction waves only depends on the local sound speed ; 3 .",
    "the interaction of kinematic and thermodynamical quantities is strongly influenced by the entropy variation .",
    "these explain why grp - based numerical schemes work well for problems under extreme conditions ( e.g. high temperature and high pressure etc . ) and the thermodynamics plays an important role in the design of high resolution schemes .    as another purpose",
    ", this paper aims to refine the grp solvers that were derived before , such as the original grp solver in @xcite , the eulerian version @xcite and high order extension @xcite . in the development of the grp solver ,",
    "an important progress was made in @xcite where the riemann invariants were introduced so that the grp solver can be extended to general hyperbolic balance laws .",
    "the current contribution emphasizes that the grp solver is independent of technical analyses although the tricky technique of `` nonlinear geometric optics '' is applied to the singularity point .",
    "it turns out that the technicality has nothing to do with any specific equation of state and readers are relieved of the tedious description of local characteristic coordinates in the previous versions of grp solver in @xcite even though all ingredients are already cooked there .",
    "thus the conclusion is applicable beyond gas dynamics .    in order to keep the clarity of our presentation ,",
    "we confine our discussion in the finite volume framework , following van leer s philosophy @xcite . in section 2",
    ", we simply summarize numerical methods for compressible fluid flows and relate them to the generalized riemann problem ( grp ) . in section 3 ,",

    "hence any possible poor resolution of the rarefaction wave may cause the numerical inaccurate capturing of the shock ( including the wave speed and the strength ) .",
    "the following numerical demonstration is carried out with cfl number @xmath193 for first order schemes and @xmath194 for second order schemes .",
    "all figures are displayed with @xmath195 points .",
    "we start the numerical demonstration with first order methods , as shown in figures [ fig - first - order ] .",
    "the first order solvers we choose are the popularly - used exact riemann solver ( godunov scheme ) , hllc solver and roe solver with entropy fix .",
    "we carry out the computations using different grid points : @xmath196 points , @xmath197 points and @xmath188 grid points , respectively .",
    "it is observed that there are large disparities of numerical solutions from the exact one even with @xmath188 grid points .",
    "the reason , we think , is the following .",
    "almost all first order schemes assume that the flow is uniform at every time step inside each computational cell , which results in the fact that the associated rarefaction wave is isentropic .",
    "the uniformity of entropy leads to the fact that the entropy variation is difficult to be included in numerical fluxes unless it can be made up through the jumps from cell boundaries .",
    "we proceed to look into the situation that schemes have accuracy of second order in space and first order in time , shown in figure [ fig - second - first ] . at each time step",
    ", the muscl type data reconstruction is adopted , but only first order flux solvers are used .",
    "it is observed that there is no significant improvement at all and even oscillations are present near the contact discontinuities .",
    "the large disparities of numerical solutions from the exact solution result from the inaccurate resolution of rarefaction waves and the presence oscillations are due to the inconsistency of spatial and temporal accuracy .    in figure [ fig - second - rk ]",
    ", we keep the muscl type data reconstruction at each time step , but increase the temporal accuracy to second order accuracy .",
    "we first use the two - stage rung - kutta temporal iteration with first order flux solvers as building blocks . the result",
    "is improved a little bit but not prominently .",
    "hence we make a trial to execute a one - stage method with acoustic grp solver ( consistent with ader @xcite ) .",
    "the result is displayed in figure [ fig - second - acoustic ] .",
    "the result is not satisfactory until the grid points are taken to be @xmath188 , and even the oscillations near the edge of the rarefaction wave are more severe .",
    "finally , we use the nonlinear grp solver in the strong wave regions to simulate this problem with @xmath192 , @xmath196 and @xmath198 grid points , respectively .",
    "the result is displayed in figure [ fig - grp ] .",
    "we can see that the computation with @xmath198 grid points can effectively cope with the resolution of strong waves .",
    "in this paper , we refine the grp solver and highlight the thermodynamic effect on the simulation of strong waves .",
    "although this work is done just for compressible euler equations , the conclusion is of general significance . as for the use of grp solver and its extension , some remarks are in order .    1 .",
    "there are two versions of the grp solver : acoustic and nonlinear . in smooth regions of flows or weak waves ,",
    "just the acoustic solver is needed . however ,",
    "once nonlinear waves become strong or thermodynamic effect becomes significant , the nonlinear grp solver has to be used .",
    "it turns out that in our simulations , the acoustic solver is used for most of the computational time , and the nonlinear grp solver works just near strong waves . 2 .",
    "we just refine the 1-d grp solver with a single physical effect in the present paper .",
    "as more physical factors are included , the grp solver can be derived similarly . to be more precise ,",
    "these factors take effect on the kinematical - thermodynamic variables and the equation is replaced by @xmath199 where @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , represent the aforementioned physical effects .",
    "it turns out that in @xmath122 is replaced by @xmath203 , @xmath204 the integrals for @xmath205 can be evaluated either precisely ( if possible ) or numerically . in parallel , @xmath147 should include other physical effects through the lax - wendroff methodology .",
    "3 .   for a specific equation of state , the gibbs relation has the corresponding implication .",
    "for example , in chemical thermodynamics @xcite , the internal energy comprises of a static energy @xmath206 , the chemical potential @xmath207 @xmath208 then the gibbs relation becomes @xmath209 recall that in the computation of entropy variation , any initial variation in is reflected in the corresponding numerical fluxes , and so does chemical potential @xmath210 .",
    "this is an example how the grp solver includes additional effects in practical applications .",
    "the role of grp solver for second order schemes is just like that of the exact riemann solver for first order schemes , but it has its own significance .",
    "we can regard the schemes based on the grp solver as discontinuous lax - wendroff schemes .",
    "the spatial - temporal coupling can effectively absorb the full ( physical ) information provided by the governing equations , which is the spirit of the cauchy - kowalevski methodology .",
