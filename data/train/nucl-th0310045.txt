    "particle production in near threshold @xmath3 reactions is a sensitive probe of the in - medium modification of the particle properties . a change of the particle spectral function which is mainly characterized by the particle mass may result in a drastic change of the available phase space and hence the production cross section .",
    "decay widths of the produced particles may be influenced in a similar way .",
    "kaonic atom experiments @xcite and the enhanced @xmath2 production observed in heavy - ion collisions by the fopi @xcite and the kaos @xcite collaborations point to a strong attractive @xmath2 potential .",
    "these results seemed to support the predictions of early theoretical approaches based on effective chiral lagrangians @xcite .",
    "however , more sophisticated theoretical calculations @xcite lead to weaker or strongly momentum dependent @xmath2 potentials , which can even become repulsive for large momenta and densities . on the contrary @xmath4 and @xmath0 potentials ( repulsive for @xmath4 and attractive for the @xmath0 meson )",
    "are believed to depend only weakly on the density of nuclear matter .",
    "the study of @xmath0 meson production in @xmath3 collisions provides an independent test of the in - medium kaon and @xmath0 potentials . in case of",
    "a strong attractive @xmath2 potential and moderate @xmath1 and @xmath0 potentials the mean proper lifetime of @xmath0 mesons decreases from the vacuum value of about 50 fm/@xmath5 to an order of magnitude smaller value in normal nuclear matter .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 mesons created in a @xmath3 collision have a large probability to decay into kaon pairs inside the nucleus",
    ". these kaons may rescatter before they leave the nucleus , and consequently the kinematic information needed to reconstruct the @xmath0 meson might be lost .",
    "this effect is expected to be bigger for a larger nucleus , therefore studying the mass dependence of the number of @xmath0 mesons reconstructed from the @xmath6 channel is a suitable probe for studying the in - medium broadening of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "@xmath0 meson production in @xmath3 collisions can also be studied via the dilepton - decay channel @xmath7 .",
    "electrons practically do not interact with the nuclear matter , and the @xmath0 mesons can be reconstructed using the dilepton invariant mass .",
    "the dilepton decay width of the @xmath0 meson is expected to be weakly affected by the medium .",
    "however , the dramatic increase of the dominant kaonic decay width causes a similar decrease of the dilepton branching - ratio , therefore , also the @xmath0 multiplicity observed via the dilepton channel is affected .    in this paper",
    "we present a theoretical study of @xmath0 meson production in @xmath3 collisions based on calculations carried out using a buu type transport model .",
    "we study the effect of in - medium @xmath0 meson broadening and kaon rescattering .",
    "we give predictions for @xmath0 production cross sections obtained from both the @xmath6 and the @xmath8 channels .",
    "in addition to @xmath0 meson production in a primary collision of two nucleons , @xmath9 , our model also incorporates the production of @xmath0 mesons in collisions of secondary particles with nucleons , namely the channels @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these channels have already been considered for @xmath0 meson production in heavy - ion collisions in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we utilize the respective cross sections from this work .",
    "the total width of the @xmath0 meson is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 means the sum of the widths of the remaining decay channels .",
    "the in - medium values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 depend on the @xmath0 mass and the kaon three - momentum @xmath17 via @xmath18 for neutral and charged kaon pairs .",
    "the superscripts ` med ' and ` vac ' refer to the in - medium and vacuum values , respectively . in vacuum",
    "the width @xmath14 amounts to 15 % ( 0.7 mev ) of the total width and originates mainly from three - pion decay or the @xmath19 decay .",
    "these channels play a minor role for the change of the total width in nuclear matter .",
    "e.g. , if one assumes that 50 % goes through the @xmath19 channel and the @xmath20 mass is reduced in matter by 200 mev the corresponding partial width increases to two mev which is still small compared to the expected change of the total width .",
    "thus , the variations of @xmath14 would not essentially change our results and are therefore neglected in our calculations .",
    "we assume furthermore that @xmath21 is not affected by the medium .",
    "we remark that eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_med ] ) is a simplification compared to a rigorous treatment of the @xmath0 meson spectrum in matter .",
    "this relation would be justified if the spectral function of kaons could be approximated with a @xmath22 function .",
    "this is justified for @xmath1 but hardly for the @xmath2 mesons @xcite . however , for an attractive @xmath2 potential of 150 mev eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_med ] ) provides a width of 45 mev which is quite similar to the value obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the rescattering of the kaons proceeds either via elastic ( @xmath23 ) or inelastic ( @xmath24 @xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) channels . in our calculations we used a fit to the available experimental data of the cross sections of these processes @xcite .",
    "we also included the rescattering of the @xmath0 mesons and their absorption via the reaction @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "the kaonic atom experiments @xcite indicated that the @xmath2 mass might decrease by about 200 mev even at normal nuclear matter density .",
    "theoretical models that are able to reconstruct the antikaon enhancement observed in @xmath30 reactions favor a density dependent potential that gives a smaller mass drop of about 70 - 120 mev at normal nuclear matter density @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 potential has been found to be weakly repulsive and we use a linear dependence on the baryonic number density @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the normal nuclear matter density . at present",
    "there is no experimental information about the @xmath0 meson potential in the nuclear medium .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the mass weakly depends on the nuclear density . @xmath34",
    "the parameter @xmath35 depends crucially on the strangeness content of the nucleons .",
    "hatsuda et al .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath35 = 0.025 while in refs .",
    "@xcite a shift of the @xmath0 mass of about 10 mev and an increase of the width up to 30 mev was predicted .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite showed using the sum rule approach that the mass shift is connected with the value of the four - quark condensate in the qcd vacuum .",
    "reasonable estimates give values up to .",
    "to cover the possible range of the parameter @xmath35 we compare calculations using and , respectively .",
    "now we are going to investigate the effects of different in - medium potentials for the @xmath2 meson .",
    "we carried out four sets of calculations : ( a ) without an in - medium @xmath2 potential , ( b ) with a moderate potential derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , ( c ) with the momentum dependent @xmath2 potential of ref .",
    "@xcite , and ( d ) with a strong , momentum independent @xmath2 potential .",
    "these potentials can be summarized in the form @xcite @xmath36\\frac{n}{n_0}.\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath5 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kminpot ] ) corresponding to these four cases are    [ cols=\"^ , < , <",
    ", < \" , ]     the potential ( d ) corresponds to early estimates to fit the energy levels in @xmath2 atoms , but it was shown recently @xcite that the moderate potential ( b ) also satisfies this constraint .",
    "the starting point of our calculations is the buu code used in @xcite .",
    "the model has been extended by including the decay of the @xmath0 meson into a charged kaon pair .",
    "we have implemented the propagation of the kaon pair which rescatters in the nuclear medium as described in section [ sec : elem ] .    to increase statistics we use the perturbative method for @xmath0 production , i.e.",
    "if in a two - particle collision the threshold is overcome , the @xmath0 meson is created and weighted with its production probability . in the case of the @xmath39 @xmath6 decay ,",
    "however , we made a monte - carlo decision in order to avoid producing too large a number of kaons with very small weights .",
    "we perform calculations for four different systems , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , in order to study the dependence on the target mass @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath0 production cross section was obtained integrating over the impact parameter .",
    "we choose a beam energy of 2.5 gev , which is below the @xmath0 production threshold in a free nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "fermi motion of the nucleons and many - step processes in the target nucleus will contribute to gain sufficient energy needed for @xmath0 production .    in the calculation",
    "we keep track of the scattering and absorption processes of the @xmath0 mesons and the history of the kaon pairs if the @xmath0 mesons decay .",
    "the invariant mass of the @xmath6 pairs can deviate from the vacuum @xmath0 mass after the kaons have left the nuclear matter . in a static potential",
    "the kaons would transform their potential energy into kinetic energy if they could escape the nucleus potential , and their invariant mass would take the value of the originally @xmath0 mass .",
    "a @xmath2 meson resulting from the decay of a very slow and light @xmath0 meson could not leave the attractive potential and will finally get absorbed .",
    "however , in reality the excited target nucleus will expand , therefore the potentials depend on time and weakens during the emission process .",
    "therefore , the loss ( or gain ) of the kinetic energy of a kaon does not generally correspond to the potential at the creation point .",
    "thus , the invariant mass of the emitted kaon pairs are widely spread .",
    "since the strong attractive @xmath2 potential has the dominant influence , the invariant mass will in most cases exceed the vacuum @xmath0 mass .",
    "we apply the criterion @xmath45 to select only those kaon pairs from which the @xmath0 meson can be reconstructed .",
    "thus the @xmath0 multiplicity which is experimentally observable via the @xmath6 channel is obtained as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of the @xmath0 mesons per event that survived , @xmath48 is the number of kaon pairs which fulfill the selection criterion ( [ eq : selection ] ) and @xmath49 is the vacuum value of the branching ratio of the @xmath0 decay . the fact that the cross section depends on the selection criterion eq .",
    "( [ eq : selection ] ) due to the spread of the invariant @xmath50 mass was also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "we also consider the decay of the @xmath0 mesons into electron pairs .",
    "the invariant masses of the electron pairs are recorded , and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : selection],[eq : phimul ] ) are applied accordingly .",
    "we mention that the long range coulomb force leads to an additional spread around the vacuum @xmath0 mass of less than 10 mev for a heavily charged target like au , a value which is small compared with the expected nuclear effects .",
    "meson production as a function of the target mass for different kaon potentials .",
    "the left hand side picture shows the result without changing the @xmath0 mass while on the right hand side the mass diminishes according to eq .",

    ", width=340 ]    the main results of our calculations are shown on fig.[sig_a03 ] .",
    "there we display the @xmath0 meson production cross sections reconstructed from the @xmath6 and the @xmath52 decay channels for the four sets of in - medium potentials .",
    "the cross sections are rescaled by @xmath53 to remove the effect of the geometrical cross section of the nucleus .    the comparison of the left and the right hand part of fig .",
    "[ sig_a03 ] shows the effect of the change of the mass of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the main effect is that the cross section increases if the mass is diminished in nuclear matter .",
    "that is seen especially for larger nuclei while the size of a nucleus like carbon is not large enough to allow sufficient secondary collision inside dense matter .    without a @xmath2 potential",
    "the @xmath0 production cross section increases with a faster than the geometrical cross section . for target masses below the copper mass",
    "the cross section is roughly proportional to the mass number .",
    "this is because the @xmath0 mesons are predominantly created in two - step processes by secondary @xmath54 and @xmath20 mesons . for larger nuclei",
    "the increase is moderate because @xmath0 mesons get absorbed in large nuclei .",
    "this is obvious if the decay is hindered inside the nucleus because of a reduction of the mass ( see right hand side of fig .",
    "[ sig_a03 ] ) .",
    "we observe an enhancement of the dilepton channel relative to the @xmath6 channel .",
    "this enhancement is largest if the @xmath2 potential vanishes and is explained by the fact that the dilepton branching - ratio increases with dropping @xmath0 meson mass and increasing @xmath1 mass .",
    "a strong attractive @xmath2 potential causes a rapid decay of the @xmath0 mesons inside the nucleus .",
    "this effect increases with the size of the target nucleus and is seen in both the numbers of observed @xmath6 and the @xmath52 pairs . in the case of the @xmath6 channel the reduction of the @xmath0 cross section is caused by the rescattering of the kaons while in the case of the @xmath52 channel a similar reduction occurs because of the decrease of the dilepton branching - ratio in nuclear matter .",
    "the results show that the target mass dependence of the observed @xmath0 production cross section is strongly altered if strong changes of the kaon masses in nuclear matter occur .",
    "if such effects exist they should be measurable by detecting kaon or electron pairs in subthreshold proton - nucleus reactions with energies available at the cosy or sis accelerators at fz jlich and at gsi darmstadt , respectively .",
