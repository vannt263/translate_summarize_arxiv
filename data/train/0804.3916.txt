    "the casimir effect was predicted in 1948 @xcite as an effect due to vacuum fluctuation of quantum fields . when attempting to calculate the casimir energy , one inevitably faces the problem of summing a divergent series .",
    "there have been a number of different regularization methods proposed and used to regularize the infinite sum to extract a physical finite quantity . among these methods , zeta regularization techniques have been widely used recently .",
    "one can see for example the articles @xcite and the books by elizalde et al @xcite and kirsten @xcite .",
    "this method has been extended to calculate the casimir energy at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "historically , casimir effect was calculated for electromagnetic field confined between two infinitely conducting parallel plates in four dimensional space  time .",
    "later on , casimir energy has been calculated for scalar field , spin @xmath2 field and electromagnetic field in more general space  time . among the different geometries of space that have been under consideration , rectangular cavities of different dimensions are among the most extensively studied @xcite , partly due to the simple geometry and also the well - developed mathematical tools .",
    "various aspects of the effect , such as the low and high temperature expansions of the casimir energy or force @xcite , the attractive or repulsive nature of the casimir force @xcite , the effect of extra dimension @xcite , etc , have been discussed .",
    "a @xmath3-dimensional rectangular cavity inside a @xmath4-dimensional space is a space of the form @xmath5\\times\\ldots\\times[0,l_p]\\times{\\mathbb{r}}^{d - p}$ ] .",
    "when @xmath6 , we say that the cavity is closed , and when @xmath7 , the cavity is non - closed .",
    "the paper by ambjrn and wolfram @xcite can be considered as the pioneer work in the calculation and discussion of casimir effects at finite temperature for massless scalar field and electromagnetic field confined within a rectangular cavity . by using dimensional regularization technique",
    ", they found that the casimir energy can be expressed using epstein zeta function whose analytic continuation is well  known .",
    "ambjrn and wolfram were also able to obtain the high and low temperature expansions of the free energy by using the chowla - selberg formula @xcite for epstein zeta function .",
    "their formulas work for @xmath7 , whereas for the case of closed cavity ( i.e. the @xmath8 case ) , they modified the @xmath7 formulas to remove divergencies based on physical arguments .",
    "however , the divergencies for the high and low temperature expansions were removed separately and they did not justify that the two results coincide at any temperature .",
    "special cases of the results of ambjrn and wolfram have been reproduced and extended by several authors using zeta regularization or other methods , see for examples @xcite .",
    "in particular , there have been an extensive study of the chowla - selberg formula for general epstein zeta function @xcite with the aim to obtain the low and high temperature expansions of the casimir energy .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no one has derived the casimir energy for fields confined in closed rectangular cavities correctly ( without divergent terms ) purely by zeta regularization techniques .",
    "one can read for example the third paragraph in the introduction of @xcite , where they pointed out this divergency problem in some of the literatures ( e.g. @xcite ) . in @xcite , the authors also mentioned that it is desirable to obtain a closed formula for the free energy of the electromagnetic field confined in a three dimensional rectangular cavity that is valid for all temperature .    in this paper",
    ", we solve a more general problem .",
    "we derive the casimir free energy at finite temperature for massless scalar fields and electromagnetic fields confined in a closed rectangular cavity with different boundary conditions , by employing zeta regularization techniques .",
    "we derive explicit formulas for the free energy , in the low and high temperature regions respectively . however , we want to emphasize that both the low and high temperature formulas are valid at all temperature .",
    "their difference lies in the manifestation of the leading behavior of the free energy at low and high temperature respectively .",
    "the advantage of using the zeta regularization approach is that we can derive formulas that work for any dimension @xmath9 at one shot . with the further help rendered by the chowla - selberg formula",
    ", we can compute the free energy effectively .",
    "we show some results graphically when @xmath10 and @xmath11 . on the other hand",
    ", we also study some behavior of the free energy using the formulas we derive .",
    "in particular , we find that the free energy is always a decreasing function of temperature . in the cases of massless scalar field with periodic and neumann boundary conditions ,",
    "the zero temperature free energy is always negative .",
    "therefore , the free energy is negative at all temperature . in the cases of massless scalar field with dirichlet boundary condition and electromagnetic fields , the",
    "zero temperature free energy can be positive .",
    "we study the cases when @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and we leave a more detail study of the general cases to another paper .",
    "when the zero temperature free energy is positive , we can conclude from the decreasing behavior of the free energy that there is a unique transition temperature ( depending on the side lengths of the cavity ) where the sign of the free energy changes from positive to negative .",
    "we show graphically the dependence of this transition temperature on the side lengths when @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in the last section ,",
    "we show how to obtain the corresponding results for a non - closed rectangular cavity @xmath12 by letting the size of @xmath13 directions of a closed cavity going to infinity .",
    "we find that our results are in agreement with those based on the method of changing the summation in @xmath13 directions to integration , which is commonly adopted by other authors .",
    "for a massless scalar field @xmath14 in @xmath4-dimensional space @xmath15 maintained in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath16 , the helmholtz free energy is conventionally defined as @xmath17where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the partition function given by @xmath20here @xmath21 is the frequency associated with the eigenmode @xmath22 of the field , and the symbol @xmath23 in the product means that the term @xmath24 is to be omitted .",
    "more precisely , the free energy @xmath25 is equal to @xmath26the first term @xmath27 is the zero temperature contribution to the free energy , also known as casimir free energy .",
    "the summation is divergent and regularization is needed to obtain a finite value .",
    "there are various regularization techniques that have been employed .",
    "one of the conventional methods is to introduce the zeta function @xmath28 ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath29it is well known that @xmath28 can be analytically continued to the complex plane with possible simple poles at @xmath30 , @xmath31 . in the case",

    "the second term in @xmath43 is known as the thermal correction to the free energy . due to the exponential term , it is a finite sum . hence if we are interested in the low temperature behavior of the free energy , we can use the expression @xmath44however , this expression is not convenient for studying the high temperature behavior of the free energy .",

    "hence , if the zero temperature free energy @xmath47 is negative , then the free energy @xmath25 will be negative for all temperature .",
    "it has been taken for granted ( or taken as definition ) that the partition function @xmath19 can be calculated using the path integral @xmath48where @xmath49 is the @xmath50-dimensional euclidean d - alembertian operator and @xmath51 is a normalization constant with the dimension of mass . in the imaginary time formalism ( or matsubara formalism ) of finite temperature field theory ,",

    "they gave the same first two leading terms as above , and no explicit formulas for the remaining terms are given .",
    "there exist many papers on the casimir energy of massless scalar field or casimir energy of electromagnetic field confined in a @xmath3-dimensional rectangular cavity in a @xmath4-dimensional space @xcite .",

    ", we can even generalize the conclusion to that the casimir energy is always negative .",
    "however , in the case of scalar field with dirichlet condition and the cases of electromagnetic fields , the sign of the casimir free energy depends on @xmath273 and the values of @xmath274 .",
    "there have been some discussions on this point in @xcite .",

    "when @xmath4 is odd and @xmath285 , there is no term proportional to @xmath286",
    "we have provided a rigorous derivation of the casimir free energy at finite temperature for massless scalar fields and electromagnetic field confined in a closed rectangular cavity with different boundary conditions by zeta regularization method . by applying chowla - selberg formula",
    ", we obtained explicit formulas for the low and high temperature expansions of the free energy , which can be written as a sum of polynomial order terms in @xmath16 or @xmath287 plus an exponentially decay term .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , such explicit formulas for the low and high temperature expansions of the free energy of fields confined within closed cavities has not been obtained previously .",
    "we noted that for all the cases considered , the free energy at finite temperature @xmath288 transforms as @xmath289under the simultaneous space ",
    "time scaling @xmath290 , @xmath291 .",
    "this in turn implies the thermodynamic relation @xmath292which has not been observed .    on the other hand ,",
    "we also show that the free energy in all the cases considered is a decreasing function of temperature . for massless scalar field under periodic and neumann boundary conditions ,",
    "the free energy is negative for all temperature . for massless scalar field under dirichlet boundary condition and for electromagnetic fields",
    ", the free energy might be positive at zero temperature .",
    "when this happens , there is a unique transition temperature at which the free energy change from positive to negative .",
    "this transition temperature is shown graphically for @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we believe that for massless scalar field under dirichlet boundary condition and for electromagnetic fields , when @xmath293 , the zero temperature free energy will also be positive for @xmath294 lying in some domain of @xmath255 .",
    "a detail study of this is left to another paper .    in the last section ,",
    "we show how the free energy for a non - closed rectangular cavity can be obtained by letting the size of some directions of a closed cavity going to infinity .",
    "we prove that the results are in agreement with that based on the integration prescription usually adopted by other authors .",
    "we remark that the discussion given in this paper focused mainly on the low and high temperature expansions of the free energy and the properties of the free energy .",
    "we have not dealt with other thermodynamic quantities such as the force , pressure , internal energy and entropy .",
    "we hope to consider these quantities in a future work .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that there exist some controversies regarding imposing boundary conditions on a quantum field .",
    "deutsch and candelas @xcite were the first to study the nonintegrable divergences in the renormalized energy density near boundaries .",
    "this problem has been re - examined by baacke and krsemann @xcite and analyzed in detail recently by jaffe @xcite and graham et al @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that the imposition of boundary conditions on quantum fields in casimir effect calculations leads to non - renormalizable infinities . as a result , fixing boundary conditions _ ab initio _ invariably results in divergences which can not be removed by renormalization .",
    "basically this problem for electromagnetic field with dirichlet boundary condition can be stated as that no real material is perfectly conducting at arbitrary high frequencies . in order to overcome this serious problem ,",
    "graham and collaborators have developed a new approach which replaces the boundary condition by a renormalizable coupling between the fluctuating field and a non - dynamical background field representing the material .",
    "on the other hand , there were responses from milton @xcite , fulling @xcite and elizalde @xcite with various attempts to resolve this issue .",
    "here we would like to mention the effort by elizalde who has tried to explain the presence of infinities as a result of drastic reduction of eigenstates when boundary condition is imposed .",
    "he has proposed to complement the zeta function method with the hadamard regularization in order to make sense of infinities present in the boundary value problems in casimir energy calculations .",
    "however such an approach can not be taken as a substitute of the more physical treatment given in ref .",
    "the system considered in this paper can be regarded as ideal cases , for which zeta function technique is still a useful tool for regularization of vacuum energy density . for a more physical treatment",
