    "there might be two kinds of dibaryon@xcite .",
    "one is the loosely bound type consisting of two octet baryons ; the deuteron is a typical example . the others are tightly bound ;",
    "the @xmath4 particle had been predicted to be such a six quark state although later calculations cast doubt on it@xcite . instead , a non - strange @xmath5 @xmath6 and a strangeness -6 @xmath7 di-@xmath2 have been predicted to be tightly bound six quark states , which are formed from decuplet baryons@xcite . the strangeness -3 @xmath1 n@xmath2 has also been predicted to be of the tightly bound type@xcite .",
    "the tensor interaction due to @xmath8 exchange plays a vital role in the formation of loosely bound deuteron . in the @xmath6 case",
    "the tensor interaction contribution to its mass is minor but is critical for its d - wave decay to the nn final state@xcite .",
    "there are other near threshold and deeply bound dibaryon candidates found in two systematic quark model calculations@xcite .",
    "this naturally raises the question as to whether or not the tensor interaction adds sufficient strength to bind these other near threshold states to become strong interaction stable , as in the deuteron case ?",
    "conversely , is the tensor interaction weak enough to leave the high spin , deeply bound states as narrow dibaryon resonances , as was shown in the @xmath6 case@xcite ?",
    "the present calculation is aimed at answering these two questions for the dibaryon candidates in the u , d , s three flavor world within the extended quark delocalization , color screening model ( qdcsm ) .",
    "our results show that both the effective s - d wave transition interactions due to gluon and @xmath8 exchanges decrease rapidly with increasing strangeness , and that the tensor contributions of k and @xmath0 mesons are negligible after a short range truncation . altogether , the tensor contributions are not strong enough to bind other near threshold six quark states , such as the @xmath9 , to become strong interaction stable with the sole exception of the deuteron .",
    "the d - wave decay widths of high spin , six quark states , such as the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 , are in the range of tens of mev to tens of kev and so these states might be narrow dibaryon resonances .",
    "the extended qdcsm is briefly introduced in section ii . in section iii , we present our results . the discussion and conclusion are given in section iv .",
    "the qdcsm was put forward in the early 90 s .",
    "details can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "although the short range repulsion and the intermediate range attraction of the @xmath12 interaction are reproduced by the combination of quark delocalization and color screening , the effect of the long - range pion tail is missing in the qdcsm .",
    "recently , the extended qdcsm was developed@xcite , which incorporates this long - range tail by adding @xmath8-exchange but with a short - range cutoff to avoid double counting because the short and intermediate range interactions have been accounted for by the quark delocalization and color screening mechanism@xcite .",
    "the exchange of k and @xmath0 mesons has been shown to be negligible in this model approach@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , their effect , especially the tensor part , has been included in this calculation to check further whether they are negligible in our model approach .",
    "the extended qdcsm not only reproduces the properties of the deuteron well , but also improves agreement with nn scattering data as compared to previous work@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the extended qdcsm , wave functions and the necessary equations used in the current calculation are given below .",

    ", @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the nucleon mass and the last factor provides the correction due to the extent of the quark wavefunction in the nucleon .",
    "the k and @xmath0 are assumed to have a flavor su(3 ) symmetric quark - meson coupling constant and the same short range cutoff , @xmath14 , as the @xmath8 s .",
    "the color screening parameter , @xmath17 , has been determined by matching our calculation to the mass of the deuteron .",
    "all of the model parameters are listed in table i.    table i : model parameters    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from table iv we see that the width of @xmath6 decay to the nn d - wave is 6.57 mev .",
    "comparison with our previous results@xcite , confirms that the width is not sensitive to the value of cutoff @xmath14 .",
    "the width of @xmath36 decays to @xmath3 d - wave is about tens of kev , about three orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the result is not changed significantly for decay channels with different spin .",
    "for example , the n@xmath37 ( spin=0 ) d - wave decay width is calculated to be 12.0 kev , and the n@xmath38 ( spin=1 ) d - wave decay width is 21.9 kev .",
    "these results confirm our expectation that the n@xmath2 is a narrow dibaryon resonance .",
    "( the width of n@xmath37 is smaller than that of the @xmath39 nn decay mainly due to the reduction of the tensor interaction , but also due to the fact that the n and @xmath40 have the same flavor content while n , @xmath2 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 have differing flavor content in each baryon . )",
    "the effects of the tensor interactions of gluon and goldstone boson exchanges on the dibaryon mass and decay width have been studied in the extended qdcsm . only in the deuteron channel",
    "is the tensor interaction of @xmath8 exchange strong enough to bind the two nucleons into a loosely bound state .",
    "no other near threshold six - quark state studied so far in the u , d , s three flavor world can be bound together by the additional attraction induced by these tensor interactions . the s - d wave effective transition interactions due to @xmath8 and gluon tensor forces both decrease rapidly with increasing strangeness . in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 channels",
    "the effective transition interactions due to the gluon tensor term become repulsive and cancel the attractive @xmath8 contribution .",
    "the tensor contribution of explicit k and @xmath0 meson is confirmed as negligible due to the same short range truncation as for the @xmath8 , in our model approach@xcite    the mass shift of the @xmath1 n@xmath2 state induced by the tensor interaction is small ( not more than 1 mev ) and the d - wave partial decay widths to @xmath3 with spin-0 and spin-1 are only 12.0 and 21.9 kev , respectively .",
    "hence , the @xmath1 n@xmath2 state appears to be a good candidate for a narrow dibaryon resonance .",
    "altogether there are only two promising narrow dibaryon resonances in the light flavor world in our model approach : the @xmath5 @xmath6 and the @xmath1 n@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath4 particle and di-@xmath2 are marginally strong interaction stable in our model .",
    "however the theoretical binding energies of both are small ( only few mev@xcite ) .",
    "table ii shows that the calculated ground octet and decuplet baryon masses deviate from the measured ones about 18 mev on average",
    ". a reasonable estimate of the model uncertainty for the dibaryon mass would be at least that large .",
    "therefore , in our model , it is unjustified to assert that the @xmath4 particle and di-@xmath2 might be strong interaction stable dibaryon candidates .",
    "this estimation is consistent with the latest di-@xmath41 hypernuclear findings@xcite .",
    "there are various broad resonances with widths @xmath45 mev around the @xmath6 mass ( @xmath46 2180 mev ) in our model which makes the analysis of the nn scattering more difficult in the energy region 2.1 @xmath47 2.4 mev where a broad bump has been found in the pp and np total cross sections .",
    "we will report on those results later .",
    "the @xmath48 n@xmath2 state is quite convincingly lower in mass than the n@xmath2 threshold , and quite possibly lower than the @xmath49 threshold , as well .",
    "we have shown the decay width to be as small as tens of kev .",
    "such a narrow dibaryon resonance might be detected by reconstructing the invariant mass of its two body decay products , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , in high @xmath2 production reactions using rhic at brookhaven and compass at cern and the future ones at jhf in japan and fair in germany .",
    "this model , the extended qdcsm , which proposes a new mechanism to describe the nn intermediate range attraction instead of the @xmath50 meson , well describes , with the fewest parameters , the properties of the deuteron and the existing nn , n@xmath41 and n@xmath51 scattering data . up to now",
    ", it is the only model which gives an explanation of the long standing fact that the nuclear and molecular forces are similar in character despite the obvious length and energy scale differences and that nuclei are well described as collection of a nucleons rather than 3a quarks . in view of the fact that the @xmath4 particle has not been observed experimentally , the bb interaction in the @xmath52 channel@xcite predicted by this model may be a good approximation of the real world . based on these facts",
    "we suppose the predictions about dibaryon states of this model might also be approximately correct . of course",
    ", the qdcsm is only a model of qcd .",
    "the high spin , high strangeness dibaryon resonance , @xmath1 n@xmath2 , may be a good venue to search for new hadronic matter and to test whether or not the qdcsm mechanism for the intermediate range attraction is realistic .",
