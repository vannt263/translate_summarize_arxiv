    "the fel collective instability in the electron beam produces an exponential growth ( along the undulator ) of the modulation of the electron density on the scale of undulator radiation wavelength .",
    "the initial seed for the amplification process are fluctuations of the electron beam current .",
    "since shot noise in the electron beam is a stochastic process , the radiation produced by a sase fel possesses stochastic features as well .",
    "its properties are naturally described in terms of statistical optics using notions of probability density distribution functions of the fields and intensities , correlation functions , notions of coherence time , degree of coherence , etc .",
    "development of the theoretical description of the coherence properties of the radiation from sase fel has spanned more than twenty years ( see @xcite .",

    "it has been found that the process of formation of transverse coherence is more complicated than that given by a naive physical picture of transverse mode selection .",
    "namely , in the case of perfect mode selection the degree of transverse coherence is defined by the interdependence of the longitudinal and transverse coherence .",

    "the origin of this fundamental simplicity relates to the properties of the electron beam .",

    "initially fluctuations are not correlated in space and time , but when the electron beam enters the undulator , beam modulation at frequencies close to the resonance frequency of the fel amplifier initiates the process of the amplification of coherent radiation .",
    "let us consider microscopic picture of the electron beam current at the entrance of the undulator .",
    "the electron beam current consists of moving electrons randomly arriving at the entrance of the undulator :    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is delta - function , ( -e ) is the charge of the electron , @xmath86 is the number of electrons in a bunch and @xmath87 is the random arrival time of the electron to the undulator entrance .",

    "the fel process is just an amplification of the initial shot noise in the narrow band near the resonance wavelength @xmath19 when both harmonics of the beam current and radiation are growing .",
    "an fel amplifier operating in the linear regime is just a linear filter , and the fourier harmonic of the radiation field is simply proportional to the fourier harmonic of the electron beam current , @xmath92 .",

    "it is the number of modes @xcite .",
    "thus , the relative dispersion of the radiation power directly relates to the coherence properties of the sase fel operating in the linear regime .",
    "the degree of transverse coherence in this case can be defined as @xcite :    @xmath100    it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that such a definition for the degree of transverse coherence is mathematically equivalent to ( [ eq : def - degcoh ] ) .",

    "general feature of the saturation regime is that fluctuations of the radiation intensity are significantly suppressed .",
    "we also find that the definition of the degree of transverse coherence ( [ eq : degcoh - m ] ) has no physical sense near the saturation point .",
    "when we trace the amplification process further in the nonlinear regime , we obtain that fluctuations of the radiation intensity and radiation power increase , and relevant probability distributions tend to those given by eqs .",

    "another practical problem refers to the probability distributions of the radiation intensity in the frequency domain , like that filtered by monochromator .",
    "for sase fel radiation produced in the linear regime the probability distribution radiation intensity is defined by gaussian statistics , and it is the negative exponential for a narrow band monochromator .",

    "all considerations presented above are related to the fundamental harmonic of the sase fel radiation .",
    "radiation from a sase fel with a planar undulator has rich harmonics contents .",
    "intensities of even harmonics are suppressed @xcite , but odd harmonics provide significant contribution to the total radiation power @xcite .",
    "comprehensive studies of the statistical properties of the odd harmonics have been performed in paper @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the statistics of the high - harmonic radiation from the sase fel changes significantly with respect to the fundamental harmonic ( with respect to gaussian statistics ) .",
    "for the fundamental harmonic the probability density function of the intensity is the negative exponential distribution : @xmath101 .",
    "mechanism of the higher harmonic generation is equivalent to the transformation of the intensity @xmath102 as @xmath103 , where @xmath14 is the harmonic number .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the probability distribution for the intensity of the n - th harmonic is given by :    @xmath104    the expression for the mean value is @xmath105 .",
    "thus , the @xmath14th - harmonic radiation for the sase fel has an intensity level roughly @xmath106 times larger than the corresponding steady - state case , but with more shot - to - shot fluctuations compared to the fundamental @xcite .",
    "nontrivial behavior of the intensity of the high harmonic reflects the complicated nonlinear transformation of the fundamental harmonic statistics . in this case",
    "a gaussian statistics are no longer valid .",
    "practically this behavior occurs only in the very end of high gain exponential regime when coherent radiation intensity exceeds an incoherent one .",
    "when amplification enters nonlinear stage , probability distributions change dramatically on a scale of the gain length , and already in the saturation regime ( and further downstream the undulator ) the probability distributions of the radiation intensity of higher harmonics are pretty much close to the negative exponential distribution @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : em1-delta ] we present evolution of the main characteristics of a sase fel along the undulator . if one traces evolution of the brilliance ( degeneracy parameter ) of the radiation along the undulator length , there is always the point ( defined as the saturation point @xcite ) where the brilliance reaches maximum value .",
    "the best properties of the radiation in terms of transverse and longitudinal coherence are reached just before the saturation point , and then degrade significantly despite the radiation power continuing to grow with the undulator length .",
    "application of similarity techniques allows us to derive universal parametric dependencies of the output characteristics of the radiation at the saturation point .",
    "as we mentioned in section 2 , within accepted approximations ( optimized sase fel and negligibly small energy spread in the electron beam ) , normalized output characteristics of a sase fel at the saturation point are functions of only two parameters : @xmath107 and the number of electrons in the volume of coherence @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the number of undulator periods per gain length .",

    "the degree of transverse coherence reaches a maximum value in the range of @xmath121 , and drops at small and large values of @xmath54 . at small values of the emittance ,",
    "the degree of transverse coherence is limited by the interdependence of poor longitudinal coherence and transverse coherence @xcite . due to the start - up from shot noise ,",
    "every radiation mode entering eq .",
    "( [ eq : modes ] ) is excited within finite spectral bandwidth .",
    "this means that the radiation from a sase fel is formed by many fundamental tem@xmath122 modes with different frequencies .",
    "the transverse distribution of the radiation field of the mode is also different for different frequencies .",
    "smaller values of @xmath54 ( smaller value of the diffraction parameter ) correspond to larger frequency bandwidths .",
    "this effect explains the decrease of the transverse coherence at small values of @xmath54 .",
    "the degree of transverse coherence asymptotically approaches unity as @xmath123 at small values of the emittance .    in the case of large emittance the degree of transverse coherence",
    "is defined by the contents of higher transverse modes @xcite .",
    "when @xmath54 increases , the diffraction parameter increases as well , leading to the degeneration of the radiation modes @xcite . the amplification process in the sase fel passes limited number of the field gain lengths , and",
    "starting from some value of @xmath54 , the linear stage of amplification becomes too short to provide a mode selection process ( [ eq : modes ] ) .",
    "when the amplification process enters the nonlinear stage , the mode content of the radiation becomes richer due to independent growth of the radiation modes in the nonlinear medium .",
    "thus , at large values of @xmath54 the degree of transverse coherence is limited by poor mode selection .",
    "the degree of transverse coherence scales as @xmath124 in the asymptote of large emittance . to avoid complications , we present here just a fit for the degree of transverse coherence for the number of electrons in the coherence volume @xmath125 :    @xmath126    recalculation from reduced to dimensional parameters is straightforward . for instance",
