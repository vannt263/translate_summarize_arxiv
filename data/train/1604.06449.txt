    "<S> the appearance of unconventional superconductivity near many heavy - fermion quantum critical points ( qcps ) motivates investigation of pairing correlations close to a `` beyond landau '' kondo - destruction qcp . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on a two - anderson - impurity cluster in which kondo destruction is induced by a pseudogap in the conduction - electron density of states . </S>",
    "<S> analysis via continuous - time quantum monte - carlo and the numerical renormalization group reveals a previously unstudied qcp that both displays the critical - local moment fluctuations characteristic of kondo destruction and leads to a strongly enhanced singlet - pairing susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> our results shed light on the extent to which different kinds of magnetic interactions induce pairing correlations in non - fermi liquid settings , thereby providing new insights into the mechanism for unconventional superconductivity in quantum critical metals .    </S>",
    "<S> heavy - fermion metals represent a prototype system in which unconventional superconductivity is driven by antiferromagnetic correlations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experiments on these strongly correlated systems have revealed quantum criticality in a wide range of compounds . </S>",
    "<S> detailed theoretical and experimental studies have provided evidence for different classes of quantum critical point ( qcp ) . </S>",
    "<S> one class follows the landau theory , in which criticality is dictated by the fluctuations of an order parameter . here , the broken - symmetry state is a spin density wave , and the theoretical description starts from the spatial and temporal fluctuations of the antiferomagnetic order parameter @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another class of qcp goes beyond the landau framework , in that it involves new critical modes besides order - parameter fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the additional critical modes describe a critical destruction of the kondo entanglement between the localized magnetic moments and conduction electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important example of a kondo - destruction qcp occurs in cerhin@xmath0 , which has the highest @xmath1 among all the ce - based heavy - fermion superconductors @xcite and is generally believed to have a @xmath2 superconducting gap symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> a sudden change of the fermi - surface topology at the antiferromagnetic qcp in cerhin@xmath0 , accompanied by a diverging tendency of the carrier effective mass @xcite , defy explanation within the spin - density - wave scenario for quantum criticality . </S>",
    "<S> instead , these properties provide evidence supporting the kondo - destruction picture .    </S>",
    "<S> how unconventional superconductivity arises near a kondo - destruction qcp has yet to receive systematic theoretical study . </S>",
    "<S> the question is challenging because the normal state is a non - fermi liquid with landau quasiparticles turned critical . </S>",
    "<S> it has previously proved illuminating to study the notion of kondo destruction within quantum impurity models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the qcp in the single - impurity pseudogap kondo and anderson models captures similar critical properties to the kondo - destruction qcp in the lattice problem ( as solved within an extended dynamical mean field theory @xcite ) , including a vanishing kondo energy scale , @xmath3 scaling of the dynamics , and a fractional exponent in the temperature dependence of the local spin susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to its single - site nature , a single - impurity model is not suitable for studying unconventional non - local pairing . </S>",
    "<S> an avenue for addressing this important issue has been opened by the development of a cluster extended dynamical mean - field theory ( c - edmft ) @xcite , which maps the periodic anderson model to a quantum cluster model coupled to self - consistently determined fermionic and bosonic baths , where the latter decoheres and eventually destroys the kondo entanglement @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the logical first step toward the full c - edmft treatment of pairing correlations near a kondo - destruction qcp is to study the corresponding properties in non - self - consistent quantum cluster models . </S>",
    "<S> recent work @xcite has shown enhanced pairing correlations in an ising - anisotropic two - impurity bose - fermi anderson model where the mechanism for kondo destruction is the coupling of the @xmath4 components of the impurity spins to a bosonic bath . </S>",
    "<S> this finding raises two important questions : does kondo - destruction quantum criticality robustly promote superconducting pairing correlations ? </S>",
    "<S> if so , what types of interaction are important ?    in this work we study a twoimpurity pseudogap anderson model with ising exchange between the impurity spins , where the driving force for kondo destruction  the exchange coupling of the impurity spins to a conduction band with a density of states that vanishes in power - law fashion at the fermi energy  preserves su(2 ) symmetry . on general grounds , we can postulate that spin - isotropic magnetic interactions , which promote spin - singlet formation , would further boost the enhancement of pairing correlations . we will demonstrate that this indeed is the case for the kondo - destruction qcp in the two - impurity pseudogap anderson model when compared with the ising - anisotropic two - impurity bose - fermi anderson model .    _ </S>",
    "<S> model and solution methods : _ the two - impurity ising - anisotropic anderson hamiltonian is @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the conduction - electron dispersion , @xmath7 the hybridization ( assumed to be local ) , @xmath8 the number of unit cells in the host , @xmath9 the impurity level energy , @xmath10 the on - site repulsion , and @xmath11 the ising exchange coupling between the impurities at positions @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the pauli matrix . the conduction - band density of states </S>",
    "<S> is chosen to be @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the half - bandwidth . for @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath19 has a pseudogap at the fermi energy @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity - band coupling is fully specified by the hybridization function @xmath21 with hybridization width @xmath22 .    for simplicity , we consider only the particle - hole - symmetric case @xmath23 and take the limit of infinite separation @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> in which there is a vanishing hybridization - induced ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida interaction and the two impurities are coupled only via the ising exchange @xmath11 . with @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> , we have two independent one - impurity pseudogap models ; for @xmath26 , a kondo - destruction qcp @xcite that we denote cr1 separates a kondo phase ( @xmath27 ) from a local - moment phase ( @xmath28 ) . with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , </S>",
    "<S> the two impurity spins are decoupled from the conduction band and anti - align in an ising antiferromagnetic configuration . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to probe the quantum phase transitions that arise when both @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we can begin by analyzing the perturbative effect of the coupling @xmath11 near the single - impurity critical point cr1 . at this qcp , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 being an @xmath35-dependent exponent that satisfies @xmath36 @xcite . since the impurities decouple , @xmath37 . </S>",

    "<S> the hamiltonian term @xmath41 is therefore a relevant perturbation at cr1 and will likely lead the two - impurity model to a new unstable fixed point cr2 as shown on a conjectured rg flow diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) .     </S>",
    "<S> +    since the pseudogap breaks conformal invariance , the model can not be treated nonperturbatively using conventional analytical methods and we instead employ continuous - time quantum monte - carlo ( ct - qmc ) @xcite and the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we present results for two representative cases : ( i ) @xmath42 , @xmath43 and ( ii ) @xmath44 , @xmath45 , where we have set the energy scale @xmath46 . </S>",

    "<S> our calculations suggest that this property also holds in the current two - impurity model ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the frequency dependences of @xmath123 at the kondo - screened and local - moment fixed points do not acquire any singular correction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the @xmath124 dependence of the singlet pairing correlation function at @xmath59 reflects the relevance of vertex corrections at an interacting critical point . </S>",
    "<S> since cr1 and cr2 both exist only for @xmath26 , we expect that @xmath125 is always smaller than @xmath126 and that as @xmath127 , @xmath125 and @xmath128 both approach 0 before cr1 and cr2 merge with the kondo - singlet fixed point and disappear . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that pairing fluctuations are always strongest in the quantum critical regime . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that the underlying kondo - destruction qcp promotes singlet superconducting pairing .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we return to the issue raised earlier of the extent to which different kinds of magnetic interactions induce pairing correlations in non - fermi liquid settings . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the ising - anisotropic bose - fermi anderson model  @xcite , the interactions that induce kondo destruction in the pseudogapped anderson model are spin isotropic ; note that the decoupled impurity problem at cr1 has su(2 ) symmetry . even though the problem is no longer fully su(2 ) </S>",
    "<S> invariant at the fixed point cr2 , the spin - flip fluctuations are still enhanced , as observed from the transverse component of the spin susceptibility @xmath129 having a slower power - law decay compared to its tree - level form ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that our model has strong correlations in the spin - singlet channel . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with general considerations , our results demonstrate that the superconducting pairing correlations in the singlet channel are much stronger here than in the ising - anisotropic two - impurity bose - fermi anderson model .    to summarize , we have found a quantum critical point in the two - impurity anderson model with a pseudogap density of states . </S>",
    "<S> it exhibits critical kondo destruction and shows all the hallmarks of an interacting fixed point , such as hyperscaling relations among critical exponents and @xmath3 scaling in the dynamical properties . </S>",
    "<S> the singlet pairing susceptibility is found to be sharply peaked at the quantum critical point . </S>",
    "<S> our results elucidate how different kinds of magnetic interactions promote spin - singlet pairing correlations in non - fermi liquid settings , and provide the basis for understanding superconductivity in the kondo - destruction quantum critical heavy - fermion systems such as cerhin@xmath0 .    </S>",
