    "discovering the structure of complex networks and understanding the underlying laws that lead to such structures is probably one of the most important problems in complex network theory  @xcite . in the smallest scale ( nodes )",
    "the topology of a network may be described by its degree distribution and in the largest scale global properties such as diameter of the network , mean degree , clustering coefficient , and shortest mean path are significant . in a middle scale , properties such as community structure are important . in recent years",
    "there have been many efforts to define and find the community structure of complex networks  @xcite .",
    "spectral algorithms are of most celebrated community detection methods .",
    "these algorithms usually use the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix corresponding to the network to find its community structure .",
    "the effectiveness of a method turns out to depend on the structure of the network itself .",
    "for example some methods give accurate results for networks with many loops , but are not good for tree like networks  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use the recently introduced  clumpiness matrix \" of a network  @xcite to identify its community structure .",
    "the clumpiness measure was introduced to give more information about the structure of networks and can be used as a measure to classify them . roughly speaking",
    "the clumpiness measure shows how high degree nodes are close to each other .",
    "it turns out that the clumpiness matrix is useful in community detection of a network .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section  [ s2 ]",
    "we introduce our method of community detection using the clumpiness matrix and give a qualitative justification for the effectiveness of the method . in sections  [ s3 ]",
    "the method is applied to some computer - generated and real - world networks with two and more than two communities .",
    "then an improvement on the algorithm is suggested and the performance of the method is tested .",
    "section  [ s4 ] is devoted to summary and concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we develop our algorithm for detecting communities using the clumpiness matrix and discuss qualitatively how the clumpiness eigenvectors can help to identify the community structure of a network .",
    "clumpiness matrix(@xmath0 ) was initially introduced by estrada _",
    "@xcite to extract parameters for classifying complex networks . for a network with @xmath1 nodes",
    "this is an @xmath2 matrix , with elements @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the degree of node @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the magnitude of the shortest path between nodes @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the eigenvectors corresponding to the ( non - increasing ) sequence of eigenvalues @xmath9 of the clumpiness matrix respectively .",
    "since the elements of @xmath0 are non - negative ; elements of @xmath10 are all of the same sign according to the perron - frobenius theorem .",
    "therefore , the elements of @xmath11 can be positive or negative in order to satisfy orthogonality condition .",
    "element @xmath12 of @xmath13 corresponds to the node @xmath14 of the network . in networks with two communities , observations",
    "show that nodes with positive elements of @xmath11 belong to the same community .",
    "this is also the case for negative elements .",
    "however , the border between these two communities is not exactly zero . in other words in some cases",
    "a node with a negative element belongs to the community of nodes with positive elements or vice versa .",
    "hence , in order to detect communities , we need a more strict method rather than merely considering the sign of elements of @xmath15s .",
    "this , and its generalization to networks with more than two communities is explained in next subsections .      for a network with two communities ,",
    "we deem a two dimensional space ( the so called _ projection space _ ) .",
    "the node @xmath5 of the network is shown in this space by @xmath16 .",
    "a similar projection space was previously employed by donetti and muoz using the laplacian matrix to unfold the community structure of complex networks @xcite .",
    "we use the same notion for the clumpiness matrix . projecting all nodes of the network in this space",
    ", it is observed that usually they are accumulated in two branches ( see fig .",
    "each group of points in this space is supposed to indicate one community .",
    "therefore , one should show a way to divide the points into two groups . in this plane",
    "each node is alternatively identified by its polar coordinate @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "our observations show that the component @xmath20 of each node is appropriate to identify its community .",
    "in other words , the @xmath20 components of nodes of each community are close to each other .",
    "hence , we need a borderline with angle @xmath21 , to separate the two branches .",
    "we take into account four possibilities to define @xmath21 : @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are maximum and minimum angles of points respectively , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are angles of points with maximum and minimum ordinates respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath30 is the average angle and @xmath31 is the maximum - minimum average .",
    "observations show that using some combination of angles and ordinates of points to define the borderline leads to better results in community detection .",
    "this is the motivation to define borderlines @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "( [ wa ] ) is a weighted averaging on angles of points , where weights are their ordinates , and it turns out that this gives better results than other definitions .",
    "an example of a simple graph having two communities is shown in fig .",
    "[ fs ] .      in networks with more than two communities , the use of eigenvectors relation is somehow different .",
    "the angle associated to each point @xmath5 , which is @xmath34 , separates one community from another when there are two of them to be partitioned .",
    "this inspires us to assume that the ratio of next eigenvectors to @xmath10 ( eigenvector with greatest eigenvalue ) , can be used to find more communities .",
    "suppose that the network is constructed from @xmath35 communities , we use the first @xmath35 eigenvectors of the clumpiness matrix to construct an @xmath36 matrix , @xmath37 , in which the column @xmath38 includes angles obtained from @xmath39 .",
    "that is : @xmath40 depicting points in a @xmath41 dimensional projection space constructed from @xmath41 columns of @xmath37 , the points related to each community are accumulated in distinct clusters .",
    "this aggregation of depicted points has also a physical justification which is explained in subsection  [ qa ] .",
    "in fact the angle @xmath42 gives the direction of point @xmath5 with respect to a reference direction ( i.e. direction of @xmath43 ) in each @xmath44 plane .",
    "now a better result could be achieved if we calculate the angles between every two points without using such a reference and find accumulation of nodes with the same direction . in this case , we should use a c - dimensional space constructed of rows of matrix @xmath45 : @xmath46    in order to partition the resulted clusters we used agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm starts with each point as a separate cluster and then progressively merge the points into bigger and bigger groups .",
    "different methods such as simple - linkage , complete - linkage and average - linkage could be used to determine when two groups should be merged together .",
    "here we used the average - linkage method as it led to better results .",
    "the rest of the procedure depends on choosing @xmath37 or @xmath47 .    in the first case",
    "the euclidean distance between points in the projection space should be derived from matrix @xmath37 . using the yielded distances",
    ", we build a cluster tree according to points average proximity .",
    "then , the @xmath35 clusters associated with communities can be derived . in case of considering the other matrix for projection space ,",
    "we are supposed to treat points as vectors and use angular distances instead .",
    "note that it is feasible to apply this method to the case of networks with two communities too .",
    "however our observations show that defining the borderlines leads to a better performance in that case . on the other hand , in the higher dimensions of projection space",
    "it is not possible to define such a borderline or generalize it without a considerable loss in performance and accuracy of the method .",
    "moreover , the use of this method in two dimensions helps to understand how the method works .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we need the number of communities to proceed with our algorithm . in some cases , a priori knowledge about this number exists .",
    "otherwise we should obtain it somehow . a possible way ( inspired by donetti and muoz @xcite and also used in @xcite )",
    "is to calculate modularity @xcite while enlarging the dimension of the projection space i.e. using two and then more eigenvectors .",
    "one can also use the gap between eigenvalues of directed laplacian matrix @xcite .",
    "this can be done rather fast by lanczos algorithm @xcite since a finite number of eigenvalues should be obtained .",
    "in addition , there are algorithms devised for this common problem @xcite . in our tests",
    "we do not take account of this problem and use the given number of communities .",
    "the outcome of this method can be explained by looking into eigenvectors and their mutual relations .",
    "let speculate the network is consisted of nodes that interact with each other through hopping of some entities",
    ". then one can correspond the following hamiltonian to the network : @xmath48 where @xmath49 acts like a localized potential which is considered to be zero in this paper for simplicity .",
    "it is rational to consider @xmath50 proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "that is , hopping between sites @xmath5 and @xmath7 is proportional to number of exiting ways from node @xmath5 multiplied by number of entries to node @xmath7 , and inversely proportional to square of nodes distance .",
    "hence , clumpiness matrix can be viewed as the negative of the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "this hamiltonian describes a system in which each site ( corresponding to a node of the network ) interacts with all other sites .",
    "therefore , @xmath52 would be the ground state of the system , which is also the most ordered state , i.e. all components of @xmath52 are positive . by increasing the energy of the system its initial order diminishes .",
    "the first exited state , @xmath53 , encompasses two regions of opposite spin - like states .",
    "the regions are expected to coincide with communities just in case of a network with two communities , since there are more and stronger interactions among the members in each group than interactions between nodes in different groups . for networks with more than two communities one should take into account more eigenvectors ( i.e. more excited states ) .",
    "when the system gradually advances to higher states , interactions make sites in each community to behave alike each other . in the @xmath35th level ,",
    "short range order is held in @xmath35 distinct regions .",
    "obtaining the inverse tangent of some data is like mapping them from one infinite space to a finite one .",
    ", width=302 ]    these regions are more distinguishable if we compare their order with the order of the ground state .",
    "this is best achieved taking into account the ratio of eigenvector components of each level to those of the ground state @xmath54 . by taking the inverse tangent of these ratios , we restrict the maximum values , making them closer together ( fig .  [ fatan ] ) .",
    "accordingly , columns of matrix @xmath37 tell us how sites have changed with respect to others in each level . as a result",
    ", clusters of points in @xmath41 dimensional space indicate the most related nodes , defining the optimum borders of regions .    for networks with heterogeneous community size distribution",
    "the situation may differ . in a very small community ,",
    "nodes have lower degrees ( i.e. fewer connections ) with respect to nodes in a large community . for small mixing between communities , nodes in the small community are more connected to the peer nodes with lower degrees , while nodes in the big community have many connections with high degree nodes .",
    "hence , nodes in small communities have low valued components in corresponding eigenvectors , i.e. they are less occupied , with respect to others in large communities which could have a broad range of component values in corresponding eigenvectors . as a result , the branch related to a small community will become much shorter and its points accumulate near the origin so that they all mix with the points related to the large communities . on the other hand , for large mixing between communities , more connections between nodes of different communities will adjust the heterogeneity and the size effect",
    "will be reduced .",
    "[ sres ] shows examples of this situation .",
    "the networks in fig .",
    "[ sres ] are constructed using an algorithm inspired from lfr benchmark  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm generates networks with power - law degree distribution and two communities in which mixing parameter and the sizes of communities are arbitrary .",
    "the maximum and average mixing parameter ( @xmath55 ) is indicated in each case .",
    "[ sres]a and fig",
    ".  [ sres]b are samples of the projection space ( @xmath56 ) for two different situations happened in a number of realizations of a network having communities with @xmath57 and @xmath58 nodes and low mixing parameter between them .",
    "the degree distribution power is @xmath59 and minimum and maximum degrees are @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively . in fig .",
    "[ sres]a the points are well separated in two distinct branches . on the other hand , in fig .",
    "[ sres]b the bigger branch is extended while points of the small community are accumulated near the origin . in @xmath57 realizations of the network @xmath62 of them",
    "was related to this situation . for a larger mixing parameter ( fig .",
    "[ sres]c ) this situation is less probable ( @xmath63 out of @xmath57 ) .",
    "the two communities in fig .  [ sres]d have the same size .",
    "this , results in perfect formation of two branches even for small mixing parameter in all @xmath57 realizations .",
    "one can also use a similar argument about the performance of laplacian matrix on detecting the communities . in this regard",
    ", there is a difference between behaviours of laplacian and clumpiness matrices .",
    "this difference results from the type of interaction that each matrix represents .",
    "the clumpiness matrix assumes a global interaction between the nodes , on the other hand the laplacian matrix represents interactions between the neighbors plus a potential well in each site ( i.e. the diagonal elements ) . because of the tight - binding interactions in the laplacian matrix , the occupation of each network s site ( i.e. element of an eigenvector ) only depends on its adjacent sites . in small mixing parameters",
    "this leads to good separation of communities .",
    "however , when the number of outer and intra links are comparable , the elements of eigenvectors will be very close and mixed together so that dividing the clusters is hard .    on the other hand , due to the infinite range of interactions in clumpiness matrix , each site is occupied according to its interaction with all the network .",
    "the nodes with more connections and stronger interactions are more occupied .",
    "hence , these nodes are placed at the end of the branches corresponding to their communities in the projection space . by increasing the mixing parameter",
    "the branches approach each other ; this approach is more appreciable near the origin than at the end of the branches .",
    "therefore , in larger mixing parameters the nodes which are far from the origin can be well separated . additionally , the nodes which are not close to boundaries of two branches are still separable .",
    "this is in contrast with the laplacian case in which the difference between different sites is not appreciable .",
    "this results in better performance of clumpiness matrix in large mixing parameters .",
    "the running time of our algorithm depends on the size of the system .",
    "below we briefly discuss this dependence for different parts of the algorithm .    in order to obtain the clumpiness matrix one needs to calculate all shortest paths of the network . two popular algorithms for this purpose are floyd - warshall with @xmath64 time complexity and johnsons with @xmath65 complexity , with @xmath1 and @xmath66 being the number of nodes and links respectively @xcite . the average - linkage hierarchical clustering method which is used in our algorithm",
    "has a time complexity of @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "the complete - linkage method used by donetti _",
    "@xcite has the same complexity , but according to our observations average - linkage leads to better results . finally we need to obtain a finite number of clumpiness matrices eigenvectors corresponding to its largest eigenvalues .",
    "this can be done by algorithms based on lanczos method  @xcite which their running time have a @xmath68 dependency on the size of the matrix  @xcite .",
    "the dependency of this method on the number of iterations and eigenvectors is negligible as they are finite .",
    "hence , the time complexity of our algorithm is @xmath69 .",
    "normalized mutual information ( @xmath70)@xcite , which provides a good inspection on the discrimination power of detection methods , is based on intersection matrix @xmath71 .",
    "the entry @xmath72 of @xmath71 , equals to the number of nodes in detected community @xmath7 common to real community @xmath5 . in a network with the number of built in communities @xmath73 ,",
    "let @xmath74 be the number of detected communities",
    ". then @xmath70 is defined as below : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the total number of nodes , @xmath77 the sum over the row @xmath5 and @xmath78 the sum over column @xmath7 of @xmath71 . in our method we suppose that the number of communities are given initially , therefore @xmath73 and @xmath74 are equal . the normalized mutual information is a number between zero and one , and greater values of @xmath70 mean the better community detection .",
    "in this section we apply our community detection method on some artificial and real - world networks .",
    "our first example ( fig .  [ fra ] ) is a network with two communities having 30 and 20 nodes respectively .",
    "the connection probability between the members of each community is 0.5 and for those in different group is 0.1 .",
    "[ frb ] shows the projection space of this network with the borderlines .",
    "[ frb ] illustrates that the borderline wa identifies the communities more accurately .",
    "borderlines mh and ma have one misidentification , while aa has 2 misidentification .    by applying our method on benchmark networks  @xcite , its accuracy will be observed more precisely . on benchmark networks , we can analyze the boundary of accuracy by calculating the variation of normalized mutual information with respect to different network parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fm2c ] the variation of normalized mutual information with mixing parameter @xmath55 ( the ratio of inter to intra links ) for networks with two communities is depicted .",
    "the benchmark networks have @xmath61 nodes and the initial parameters are defined as follows : degree distribution exponent @xmath79 , maximum degree @xmath80 , minimum community size @xmath81 and maximum community size @xmath82 . in this figure",
    "we can see the average @xmath70 for wa and aa definitions .",
    "the two other definitions have @xmath70 between wa and aa lines .",
    "we see that the discrimination power decreases with the increase of @xmath55 .",
    "it should be noted that in these benchmark networks for @xmath83 the communities are not well defined any more , according to the planted @xmath84-partition model  @xcite .",
    "in addition we applied our method to the real networks of zachary s karate club ( fig .  [ fk ] )  @xcite and dolphin social network ( fig .",
    "[ fd ] )  @xcite .",
    "there is no preference among the four borderlines in karate club network .",
    "however , in dolphin social network , the weighted average ( wa ) seems to work more properly , while the usual average ( aa ) has the lowest distinction power .",
    "we used lfr benchmarks @xcite to examine the performance of the algorithm on networks with different parameters .",
    "[ fba ] illustrates the performance of algorithm on networks with the average degree @xmath85 , the power - law exponent of degree distribution exponent @xmath86 and community size distribution @xmath87 .",
    "networks with @xmath88 and @xmath89 nodes are considered .",
    "in addition , two ranges are considered for minimum and maximum community sizes : averagely small community sizes @xmath90 and averagely big community sizes @xmath91 which are indicated by signs @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively .",
    "a better performance is observed for larger networks ( @xmath94 ) according to normalized mutual information @xmath70 . in case of smaller communities and larger networks @xmath95",
    ", @xmath70 slightly increases with @xmath55 up to @xmath96 , .",
    "this is because of the fact that size resolution effect ( resulted from large number of very small communities with average degree fewer than @xmath85 ) decreases when mixing parameter grows . for @xmath97 , the high mixing between communities dominantly",
    "makes it harder to detect communities , causes the decrease in @xmath70 .    in fig .",
    "[ fbb ] , the size resolution effect is investigated for networks with @xmath88 nodes and different average degrees ( @xmath98 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) by considering @xmath99 and plotting @xmath70 against @xmath100 . the results are depicted for different choices of projection space ( @xmath56 or @xmath37 ) .",
    "the hierarchical clustering algorithm constructs the communities according to the proximity of points in the projection space . in each step of this algorithm",
    "the two closest clusters of points are merged together , where the closeness of each pair of clusters is defined according to a similarity measure .",
    "we are interested in a merging procedure in which there is a priority for joining clusters that are also closer to each other in the real network . in their spectral algorithm , donetti and muoz @xcite",
    "take this into account by inserting a constraint that two clusters are merged only if there is a link between them in the network . implementing this constraint",
    "will improve the performance of our algorithm as well .",
    "however our observations show that a considerably better performance is achieved by simply altering the initial similarity between pair of points as follows : @xmath101 here @xmath102 is the similarity between points @xmath5 and @xmath7 and @xmath103 the length of the shortest path between nodes @xmath5 and @xmath7",
    ". this change does not affect the main body and speed of the algorithm .      in fig .",
    "[ fc ] the performance of the algorithm achieved by this improvement is illustrated .",
    "the network parameters are the same as fig .",
    "now the method has better performance and the negative effect of heterogeneity of the community sizes is appreciably decreased .",
    "this is because even if some clusters are close to each other in the origin of projection space , the nodes in this region have less interactions with the rest of the network , especially with nodes other than their own community , hence they are more distant from nodes of other clusters .",
    "accordingly , these clusters are not mixed any more with the new definition of similarity . in addition , our method still works better for lager networks of @xmath89 nodes . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fc ] the performance of the algorithm by using the laplacian matrix instead of clumpiness matrix is illustrated .",
    "in small mixing parameters both matrices work well , however in large mixing parameters clumpiness matrix has a better performance .",

    "@xcite to compare the performance of several methods .",
    "hence , a comparison between our method and some other methods with high performances is possible . in comparison with the algorithm of donetti and muoz ( dm ) @xcite , our algorithm has an appreciably better performance for @xmath104",

    "compared to the inset of fig .",
    "[ fc ] , the dm algorithm should work better in this region .",
    "this difference can be due to the error in finding the number of communities and the differences in employing hierarchical clustering algorithm .",
    "additionally it is likely that a local maxima of modularity is achieved in the realizations of the dm method , as in the case of @xmath106 networks the number of communities is much more , one should consider a larger maximum number of communities ( @xmath107 ) in the dm method to obtain the global maxima of modularity .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the infomap method @xcite was shown to have a great performance with @xmath108 up to @xmath109 for all networks , however it yields @xmath110 for @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , and @xmath114 for @xmath115 . in comparison ,",
    "our method yields values of @xmath70 close to @xmath63 ( the least @xmath116 ) up to @xmath98 and in large values of mixing parameter when infomap yields very small values of @xmath70 our method has an appreciably better performance .",
    "in this part the method is used to illustrate the communities in several real networks which have @xmath117 or more communities .      as our first example , we considered communities in a graph constructed from interactions between proteins ( fig .",

    "this biological network is comprised of three communities and members of each community either have a certain function or correspond to a protein complex @xcite .",

    "another example is a social network of american collage football teams ( fig .",

    "the improvement of algorithm in other aspects is also possible .",
    "for example one can try to build a graph matrix whose eigenvectors can better highlight the communities .",
    "this can be done by substituting another centrality measure ( e.g. betweenness , closeness , random walk centrality @xcite ) instead of nodes degree , which is more related to the role of nodes in communities .",
    "additionally other suitable distance measures can be used ( e.g. one based on random walks introduced in @xcite ) .",

    "one should replace the degree of a node with the sum of its links weights .",
    "the shortest path length between two nodes can be defined in various ways depending on the structure of the network and meaning of weights .",
