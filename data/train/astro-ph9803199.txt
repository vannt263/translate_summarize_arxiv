    "the polarization of background starlight has been used for nearly half a century to probe the magnetic field direction in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the observed polarization is believed to be caused by dichroic extinction of background starlight passing through concentrations of aligned elongated dust grains along the line - of - sight .",
    "although there is no general consensus on which is the dominant grain alignment mechanism ( lazarian , goodman & myers 1997 ) , it is generally believed that the shortest axis of the `` typical '' elongated grain tends to be become aligned to the local magnetic field .",
    "for this orientation , the observed polarization vector is parallel to the plane - of - the - sky projection of a line - of - sight - averaged magnetic field ( davis & greenstein 1951 ) .",
    "the line - of - sight averaging inherent in background starlight polarimetric observations can make interpretation of the polarization produced by different field orientations and/or several independent dust clouds very complicated .",
    "nonetheless , it was thought that if lines of sight with just one localized very dusty region ( such as a dark cloud ) between us and a background star could be found , surely the polarization would reveal the field associated with that dusty region .",
    "however , recent studies in the taurus region ( goodman et al . 1992",
    "; gerakines et al . 1995 ) and other parts of the sky ( creese et al . 1995 ; goodman et al . 1995 ) have uncovered substantial evidence to show that dust inside cold dark clouds has lower polarizing power than dust in the general warm ism .",
    "this means that the polarization of the light from a background star is a non - uniformly _ weighted _ line - of - sight average of the projected plane - of - the - sky field , and that grains in cold dark clouds are systematically down - weighted .",
    "the ultimate implication of this down - weighting is that above some ( column ? )",
    "density threshold , the polarization of background starlight gives no information about the magnetic field in dark clouds .",
    "it is the goal of this letter to find and physically describe this threshold .",
    "the evidence that grains in cold dark clouds are inefficient polarizers of background starlight is multi - faceted .",
    "eight years ago , goodman et al . (",
    "1990 ) found that the smooth large - scale patterns apparent in polarization maps of dark cloud complexes ( e.g. vrba et al .",
    "1976 ; vrba et al .",
    "1981 ; moneti et al .",
    "1984 ; whittet et al . 1994 )",
    "do not systematically change in response to the large density enhancements represented by the dark clouds .",
    "after this realization , it was hypothesized that perhaps optical polarimetry was incapable of seeing field changes which might occur only in the high - density , optically opaque , interiors of dark clouds .",
    "so , near - infrared polarimetry , which can probe the optically opaque cloud interiors was undertaken .",
    "the near - infrared observations showed that the mean direction and dispersion of the polarization vectors are virtually _ identical _ in the cloud interiors and their peripheries ( goodman et al .",
    "1992 ; 1995 ) .",
    "thus , the presence of cold dark clouds still appeared to have no geometric effect on the polarization maps , implying either that : 1 ) the field is truly unaffected by the cloud ; or 2 ) that background starlight polarimetry is somehow insensitive to the field in dark clouds .",
    "polarization - extinction relations provide the best discriminant between these hypotheses . for grains of constant polarization efficiency ,",
    "@xmath0 should rise with @xmath1 .",
    "using the near - infrared observations , goodman et al .",
    "( 1992 , 1995 ) find that the _ percentage of polarization does not rise with extinction _ in cold dark clouds .",
    "the simplest interpretation relation will diminish due to field tangling , it will remain positive even for highly tangled fields if all grains polarize equally well ( see jones 1989 ; jones et al .",
    "1992 ) . ] of this result is that dust in dark clouds adds plenty to the observed extinction , but has very little  polarizing power \" and so adds only a very small fraction to the observed net polarization .",
    "a number of factors , including poor grain alignment , grain growth , and/or changes in grain shape or composition , could be responsible for the low polarization efficiency exhibited by dust grains in cold dark clouds ( see goodman et al .",
    "regardless of which factor(s ) cause(s ) the low polarization efficiency exhibited by by dust in dark clouds ,",
    "the fact is that background starlight polarimetry does not reliably reveal the magnetic field _ in _ dark clouds .",
    "based on the near - infrared studies , we expect that the fraction of grains with high polarization efficiency is relatively constant in the lower - density warm ism , but drops precipitously in dark clouds .",
    "therefore , we hypothesize that a breakpoint in the @xmath2 relationship might exist at the dark clouds  edges \" , which previous studies in the near - ir ( goodman et al . 1992 ; 1995 ; gerakines et al .",
    "1995 ) could not detect , due to their inability to measure low @xmath1 s accurately enough . in this letter",
    ", we present our attempt to carefully study the @xmath4 relation near dark clouds , and thus offer a set of guidelines as to where the polarization maps can be taken as faithful representations of the magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky , and where they can not .",
    "our observing strategy consists of three parts .",
    "first we obtain ccd images ( using @xmath5 , and @xmath6 broad - band filters ) of two 10 arcmin by @xmath7 5 deg `` cuts '' ( see figure 1 ) through the taurus dark cloud complex .",
    "second , we measure the spectrum of 94 stars along the cuts in order to determine their spectral types . using the multi - color photometry and the spectral types , we derive an extinction and distance to each of the stars , using the relation @xmath8 , with @xmath9 ( savage & mathis 1979 ; vrba & rydgren 1985 ) .",
    "third , we measure the polarization of as many of the stars for which we had extinction values based on the photometry and spectral classification as time permits .",
    "( the polarimetry is by far the most time - consuming of the three steps . )",
    "the cuts shown in figure 1 pass at approximately right angles through two well known highly - elongated dark clouds in the taurus complex , l1506 and b216 - 217 , both of which are thought to lie 140 @xmath10 10 pc from the sun ( kenyon et al .",
    "we chose this orientation for the cuts in order to insure both : 1 ) a sample of stars with a large dynamic range in extinction ; and 2 ) that many of the high @xmath1 values measured would be produced by a single localized dark cloud along the line of sight .",
    "we attempted to exclude foreground stars by not selecting stars which appear relatively bright , and the measured spectroscopic parallax distances ( see arce & goodman 1998 , hereafter ag98 ) confirm that we largely succeeded in doing so .",
    "( our stellar sample only has three stars with distances less than 150 pc . ) in total , the polarization of 31 stars was measured .",
    "in addition , we used previously published data to obtain color excesses for two stars ( kenyon et al . 1994 ) and polarization information for 5 stars ( goodman et al . 1990 ) .    the broad band images were obtained using the ccd camera on the smithsonian astrophysical observatory ( sao ) fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) 1.2-meter telescope on mt .",
    "hopkins , arizona .",
    "the stellar spectra were obtained using the sao fast spectrograph on the flwo 1.5-meter telescope .",
    "the observations were carried out during the fall trimesters of 1995 and 1996 .",
    "for information on the reduction of the photometric and spectroscopic data see ag98 . employing an analysis method similar to that of wood et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , we also created an extinction map of taurus , with 5 resolution , using co - added images of flux density from the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) sky survey atlas ( see ag98 ) .",
    "the polarization observations were carried out at the mont mgantic observatory , using the beauty and the beast two - channel photoelectric polarimeter ( described in manset & bastien 1995 ) on the 1.6-meter ritchey - chrtien telescope , in february 1996 , december 1996 and february 1997 .",
    "we used a schott rg-645 filter which , combined with the photomultiplier response , gives a broad passband of 2410  , centered at 7660  .",
    "a small instrumental polarization of @xmath11 was measured and subtracted from the observations .",
    "the polarization scale was determined by observing a bright star and using a calibration prism which gives essentially 100% polarized light .",
    "the origin of the position angles was determined by observing standard polarized stars .",
    "the uncertainty in the polarization angle ( @xmath12 ) is given by the formula @xmath13 $ ] ( serkowski 1974 ) .",
    "table 1 summarizes the relevant polarization and extinction values derived from all of the data collected and assembled .",
    "plots of polarization vs. extinction are shown in figure 2 . there seem to be two different trends in the @xmath2 plots .",
    "most stars with @xmath14 mag follow a trend in which their percentage of polarization increases with extinction .",
    "but many stars with @xmath15 mag keep a more or less constant @xmath0 with extinction . upon overlaying the stars positions on an extinction map ( figure 1 )",
    ", it becomes apparent that several of the stars which have high extinction , but low polarization are very near peaks in the optical depth ( i.e. , dark clouds ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the positions of most of the other stars which follow an increasing @xmath0 with increasing @xmath16 tend to lie either on places were the optical depth is small ( like the southernmost stars ) or on small , randomly occurring , high extinction patches , far away from the optical depth peaks .",
    "from the results of previous studies we can easily guess that the @xmath2 relation for stars that are background to cold dark clouds might be different from that of stars background to the general ( lower - density ) ism .",
    "thus , it makes sense to attempt to systematically separate our stellar sample into stars that are and are not  background to dark clouds , \" in order to study the potentially different @xmath2 relations .",
    "visually inspecting the positions of the stars superimposed on an extinction map ( see figure 1 ) is not an adequately quantitative method of reliably achieving this separation .",
    "our definition of a star  background to a dark cloud \" is one which lies close to an extinction peak _ and _ is primarily extinguished by dust in dense regions at a single distance . with this definition in mind ,",
    "we use two different means of differentiating between the two `` types '' of stars .",
    "the first method uses the iras @xmath1 map .",
    "the three main extinction ridges which cross the slice of taurus shown in figure 1 are l1506 , b216 - 217 and the region wood et al .",
    "( 1994 ) name iras core tau m1 . for each star which lies near one of these ridges",
    ", we plot @xmath1 along a line on the plane of the sky defined by the normal to the nearest ridge from the star . for each of these @xmath1 vs.",
    "offset profiles , we fit a gaussian to the resulting extinction profile and then measure the distance from the @xmath1 peak to the star s position , in units of half width at half maximum ( hwhm ) .",
    "the results of this procedure are shown in table 1 .",
    "we then divide the sample into two groups : stars that appear close to the optical depth peaks in projection and stars that appear far .",
    "we experimented with different distances as the boundary between the two groups , and decided to finally adopt 1.6 hwhm as such . with 1.6 hwhm as the dividing value",
    "we obtain two clear @xmath2 trends in the sample , while having the dividing distance between close and far stars from the dark cloud extinction peaks as far as possible .",
    "the second method of separating the stars uses the fact that the observed extinction can be thought of as a sum of the extinction due to the dense regions of the dark cloud and the extinction due to the dust foreground and background to the dark cloud . using the same extinction profiles determined from the iras map in the first method",
    ", we assume that by subtracting a baseline from the gaussian we can eliminate the extinction due to the dust foreground and background to the cloud , and that the baseline - subtracted gaussian gives an estimate of the extinction due to the dense region of the cloud . the value of the baseline - subtracted gaussian at the stars projected position",
    "can then be compared to the total value of iras @xmath1 at the same position , giving an estimate of the percentage of extinction due to the dark cloud itself .",
    "we say that a star is  background to a dark cloud \" if more than 20% of the iras @xmath1 at the star s projected position is due to the baseline - subtracted gaussian .",
    "a potential problem with this method is that the dark cloud does not necessarily has to have a gaussian profile  it could be gaussian - like , with broad wings . if this is so , then by subtracting a baseline , one is potentially subtracting a substantial part of the extinction due to the dark cloud .",
    "we classify a star as being  background to a dark cloud \" if it satisfies the background star criteria for both of the two different methods ( see table 1 ) .",
    "_ figure 2 clearly shows that @xmath0 increases with @xmath1 for stars that were classified background to the ism , while @xmath0 is roughly constant with @xmath1 for stars classified as being background to dark clouds . _ after making linear least - square fits , weighted by the uncertainty in @xmath0 , to the two different groups , we find that the trends cross at @xmath17 mag .",
    "the errors in the fitted line coefficients imply an uncertainty of @xmath10 0.2 mag for this intersection point .",
    "thus , we conclude that there is a break in the @xmath2 relation for this region of taurus at @xmath18 mag .",
    "we believe that choosing a constant value of @xmath19 to derive the extinction to each star does not adversely affect our results .",
    "studies have shown that denser regions usually harbor bigger grains ( whittet & blades 1980 ) and bigger grains imply larger values of @xmath19 ( cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ) , which in turn imply a greater value of @xmath1 for a given value of @xmath20 .",
    "thus we expect that if there are changes in @xmath19 towards different lines of sight , then @xmath19 should be larger for lines of sights that pass through dark clouds .",
    "if this is so then the stars observed through these lines of sight would have more extinction than originally calculated .",
    "these points would then shift to the right in our @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 plot in figure 2 .",
    "if this happened , the break in the @xmath2 relation would just be more pronounced and clear .",
    "we are relatively certain that the value of @xmath19 does not vary in a systematic way for stars background to the general ism , since their color - excess - determined extinction agrees very well with the other methods of obtaining extinction ( see ag98 ) .",
    "the two trends we find in our data  rising @xmath0 with @xmath1 and roughly constant @xmath0 with @xmath1have each been observed in previous studies . but",
    "these trends have never been observed together , in the same region , as clearly distinct trends before .",
    "in fact , most studies find very large scatter in their @xmath2 plots , and a clear linear correlation in the @xmath2 relation for stars background to warm dust ",
    "our first trend  is only observed in a few studies , such as wilking et al .",
    "( 1979 ) or guetter & vrba ( 1989 ) . theoretically , one should observe this linear correlation if along all lines of sight each grain polarizes light equally well , and there are no big changes in the field orientation .",
    "most probably this is the case in these two studies since most of their lines of sight pass through similar environments , in the small region of the sky that they studied .",
    "the second trend in our data  a slow or no rise in @xmath0 with @xmath1has been observed in near - ir polarimetric studies of stars background to cold dark clouds ( goodman et al . 1992 ; 1995 ) .    in general , most studies of the @xmath2 relation find that there is a fuzzy upper bound to the amount of polarization possible for a particular extinction and that observed points lie anywhere below this upper limit in the @xmath2 plane ( hiltner 1956 ; vrba et al .",
    "1976 ; vrba et al .",
    "1981 ; moneti et al .",
    "( 1984 ) ; vrba et al . 1993",
    "; whittet et al .",
    "1994 ; gerakines et al . 1995 ) .",
    "such results can easily be explained by allowing the polarization efficiency of the grains and/or the field orientation with respect to the plane of the sky to vary from one line of sight to another ( hiltner 1956 ) .",
    "polarization studies of regions near dark clouds most probably sample lines of sight passing through a variety of different physical environments lines of sight with different dust and gas densities , which likely contain grains with different average polarizing efficiencies . in most cases , the samples in these studies",
    "are not separated depending on the characteristics of the line of sight , thus the upper - envelope behavior exhibited by their @xmath2 relations is expected . moreover ,",
    "many of these studies also find a decrease in polarization efficiency ( @xmath21 ) with increasing extinction which is likely due to the fact that the highly extinguished stars often lie behind dark clouds  where dust is likely to have a lower polarization efficiency .    a break in the @xmath4 relation can be predicted for stars background to quiescent dark clouds by many different theories .",
    "most recently , draine & weingartner ( 1996 ) studied the effect of radiative torques due to the anisotropic illumination of helical grains .",
    "they came to the conclusion that , in the average ism , diffuse clouds , and warm star forming regions , such a process is able to produce rotational velocities higher than the ones produced by suprathermal mechanisms studied previously ( e.g. spin - up caused by h@xmath22 formation on grains ; purcell 1979 ) .",
    "but , on the other hand , they conclude that inside quiescent dark clouds the radiative torques are unimportant due to the weakened radiation fields , and higher matter density .",
    "they explicitly state that they expect grain alignment near the cloud surface , but not at depths of @xmath23 mag .",
    "moreover , a quantitative study of six types of alignment mechanisms in the dark cloud l1755 was done by lazarian , goodman & myers ( 1997 ) . using data from the literature they studied the joint action of different alignment mechanisms in the outer , intermediate and inner regions of the cloud .",
    "they came to the conclusion that all the major mechanisms fail to produce alignment in the inner and intermediate regions ( which they assume to have @xmath24 ) , while grain alignment is efficient in the outer regions ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the value we obtain for the break in the @xmath4 relation , @xmath26 mag , is consistent with the these two studies .",
    "these results are not necessarily inconsistent with the observed polarization in the 3 ice feature ( hough et al .",
    "polarization in the ice feature is only in stars background to star - forming clouds ( hcl 2 , omc-1 ) which are more likely warmer than the filamentary cold dark clouds in our study , and hence can harbor grains with higher polarization efficiency ( see figure 7 in goodman et al .",
    "the breakpoint in the @xmath4 relation places important restrictions on the use of polarimetry in studying interstellar magnetic fields .",
    "since the polarization efficiency of the dust inside dark clouds is very low , most of the polarization observed for lines of sight which pass through these extinction peaks is not due to the dark cloud ; it is due to dust background and foreground to the cloud .",
    "hence , one should not use background starlight polarimetry to map magnetic fields inside dark clouds . with the results of this study we can quantify the word  inside . \" in regions like taurus , _ it is safe to interpret the polarization of background starlight as a representation of the plane - of - the - sky projected magnetic field up to the 1.3 @xmath10 0.2 mag `` edge '' of the dark cloud_. in other words the linear relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 that exists in the low - density ism breaks down for stars background to the @xmath27 mag of extinction produced by a dense localized dusty region ( i.e. , dark cloud ) .",
    "after this edge polarization no longer rises with extinction , and thus can not reveal the field structure in the dense region .",
    "we restate that this proscription only applies for stars background to cold dark clouds , as stars background to the warm ism have not been shown to exhibit such behavior .",
