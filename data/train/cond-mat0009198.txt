    "with the realization that the problem of anderson localization is amenable to a rg analysis came the understanding that some transport and spectral properties of a quantum particle subjected to a weak random potential depend qualitatively only on dimensionality and the symmetries of the random potential @xcite . for essentially all types of randomness",
    "the dimensionality two of space plays the role of the lower critical dimension : below two dimensions and for arbitrary weak disorder a quantum particle is always localized ( i.e. , the wavefunction is insensitive to a change in boundary conditions , or , equivalently , exponential decay of the conductance with system size ) , whereas a finite amount of disorder is needed to localize a quantum particle in three dimensions .    a notorious exception to this rule is the case of a particle on a single chain with random nearest neighbor hopping which appears in many reincarnations , e.g. , random @xmath1 spin chains @xcite and diffusion in random environments @xcite . in all these cases , the cause underlying the different behavior of random systems with off - diagonal disorder is the existence of a sublattice , or _",
    "chiral _ , symmetry , which is absent for diagonal disorder @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this contribution is to review our recent work ( together with simons and altland @xcite ) on the random hopping problem in a quasi - one - dimensional `` wire '' geometry @xcite .",
    "we consider the density of states ( dos ) and conductance , and focus on the differences between the cases of off - diagonal and diagonal disorder in the localized regime .",
    "( for off - diagonal disorder , we assume absence of diagonal disorder . )",
    "the quantum wire is the logical intermediate between one and two dimensions .",
    "the quasi - one - dimensional geometry allows us to find exact solutions for the conductance at the band center @xmath2 and the dos near @xmath2 , while , in contrast to purely one - dimensional counterparts , it still shows a crossover from a diffusive to a localized regime , as is the case in two dimensions .    in the diffusive regime ,",
    "differences between off - diagonal and diagonal disorder are limited to small quantum corrections to the dos and conductance .",
    "the dos near @xmath2 follows from the so - called `` chiral '' random matrix theory ( rmt ) , which was originally proposed in the context of quenched approximations to the qcd hamiltonian @xcite . in chiral rmt",
    ", all eigenvalues come in pairs @xmath3 . for @xmath0 coupled random hopping chains , level repulsion between the smallest eigenvalue above the band center @xmath2 and its mirror image then leads to a suppression of the dos near @xmath2 , @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the dos per unit volume , @xmath6 is the fermi velocity , @xmath7 is the mean level spacing , and the symmetry index @xmath8 in the presence of both time - reversal and spin - rotational symmetry and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) if time - reversal symmetry ( spin - rotational symmetry ) is broken .",
    "several level spacings away from the center of the band , the mirror symmetry of the spectrum plays no important role , and the level statistics were found to agree with those of the standard rmt .",
    "similarly , different quantum corrections to the conductance are obtained for energies close to the band center @xcite .    on the other hand , beyond the diffusive regime , i.e. , for sample lengths @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a crossover length scale ( to be defined after eq .",
    "( [ eq : lngodd ] ) below ) , quantum corrections are dominant , and the differences between diagonal and off - diagonal disorder can be much more dramatic .",
    "while for diagonal disorder , the dos is constant as @xmath13 , dyson showed that for off - diagonal disorder @xmath14 diverges upon approaching the band center @xcite : @xmath15 note that , in contrast to the diffusive regime ( [ eq : dosrmt ] ) , the energy scale that governs the divergence does not depend on the system size , nor does the form of the singularity depend on the symmetry index @xmath16 .",
    "for @xmath0 coupled chains , dyson s result ( [ eq : dyson ] ) , remains valid for odd @xmath0 , ) and ( [ eq : mean dos if even n ] ) may depend on @xmath0 . ]",
    "but not for even @xmath0 @xcite : for an even number of chains , the dos diverges only logarithmically for @xmath8 , whereas @xmath17 shows a pseudogap for @xmath18 , @xmath19 the relevant energy scale , however , remains the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyson ] ) . the even - odd effect in the dos around @xmath2",
    "is accompanied by an even - odd effect for the conductance @xmath20 at the band center @xcite . for odd @xmath0 , there is no exponential localization ; @xmath20 has a broad distribution , with fluctuations that are of the same order as the average , @xmath21 where the crossover length scale @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the mean free path .",

    "away from the band center and for diagonal disorder , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , irrespective of the parity of @xmath0 , as for quantum wires with diagonal disorder @xcite .",
    "note that for even @xmath0 , despite the similarities , differences between off - diagonal and diagonal disorder persist , though they are more subtle .    in the remaining sections of this paper , we review the theory describing these two parity effects .",
    "the random hopping model is a lattice model with nearest neighbor hopping only , where the hopping amplitude takes a different ( random ) value between adjacent sites . in our case",
    "we consider a two - dimensional square lattice , for which the schroedinger equation takes the form @xmath27 hermiticity requires @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we consider a quasi - one - dimensional geometry ( length @xmath30 of the disordered region much larger than its width @xmath31 , where @xmath0 is the number of chains and @xmath32 the lattice constant ) , with open boundary conditions in the transverse direction : @xmath33 . on the left ( @xmath34 ) and",
    "right ( @xmath35 ) , the disordered region is attached to ideal leads ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 for @xmath38 or @xmath35 ) . in the disordered region ,",
    "the hopping amplitudes show fluctuations around the average values @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the fluctuations are real , complex , or quaternion , for the symmetry classes @xmath8 , @xmath41 , and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the random flux model is a special version of the random hopping model for which each plaquette is threaded by a random flux . in that case , the hopping amplitudes have magnitude @xmath42 and a random phase @xmath43 , so that the total phase accumulated going around a plaquette equals the phase through the plaquette in units of the flux quantum @xmath44 .",
    "the random hopping model is special because of the existence of a sublattice symmetry : under a transformation @xmath45 the hamiltonian changes sign .",
    "hence , if @xmath46 is an eigenvalue of @xmath47 , then @xmath48 is so as well .",
    "the band center @xmath2 is a special energy with respect to this transformation . as we shall see below , it is the existence of this extra symmetry that causes the spectral and transport properties of the random hopping model at the band center to be so dramatically different from those of models with on - site disorder . for historical reasons ,",
    "the sublattice symmetry is referred to as _ chiral _ symmetry .      while the lattice version ( [ eq : nn rhp ] ) of the random hopping model is the version that is usually considered in the literature , we use a different ( continuum ) model for our analytical calculations , @xmath49\\psi(y ) .",

    "( [ eq : schr eq cont ] ) and below we choose our units such that the fermi velocity @xmath57 .",
    "the chiral symmetry is now represented by @xmath58 for @xmath8 , @xmath53 ( @xmath52 ) is ( anti-)symmetric ; for @xmath59 , @xmath53 ( @xmath52 ) is ( anti)-self dual .",
    "the disorder potentials @xmath52 and @xmath53 are chosen independently and gaussian distributed with zero mean and with variance @xmath60 @xmath61 respectively .",
    "( for small @xmath0 a slightly more general form of the variance is needed , see @xcite . )",
    "the justification for this change of models is our anticipation that , for weak disorder and for a sufficiently large system size , only the fundamental symmetries of the microscopic model are relevant . in order to verify this assumption of universality",

    "( [ eq : schr eq cont ] ) , would have led to different statistical properties of the scattering matrix for a thin slice .",
    "however , as we have verified numerically , such differences are irrelevant in the rg sense , i.e. , they disappear for sufficiently long wires ( longer than the mean free path @xmath23 ) and weak disorder ( @xmath23 much larger than the lattice constant @xmath32 ) .",
