    "quantum teleportation @xcite is the transfer of an unknown quantum state from a sender ( alice ) to a receiver ( bob ) by means of the entanglement shared by the two parties and appropriate classical communication .",
    "bob recovers an exact copy of the state teleported to him by alice only if the quantum channel is the ideal maximally entangled state , which however , in the case of continuous variables ( cv ) , is an unphysical infinitely squeezed state @xcite . nevertheless , by considering the finite quantum correlations between the quadratures in a two - mode squeezed state , braunstein and kimble @xcite proposed a realistic protocol employing a beam splitter and homodyne measurements , which approaches perfect teleportation in the limit of infinite degree of squeezing .",
    "this protocol ( and its various extensions ) has been then implemented by various groups @xcite .",
    "the success of a teleportation experiment is quantified by the _ fidelity _ which , in the case of a pure input state @xmath0 , is given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the output state of the protocol , and coincides with the probability of finding the input state @xmath3 at the output .    the relation between the fidelity of cv teleportation @xmath4 and the entanglement shared by the distant parties is nontrivial and it has been investigated in various papers @xcite .",
    "in fact , entanglement is the key resource that allows to beat any classical strategy for transmitting quantum states .",
    "one can say that genuine quantum teleportation has been performed only if @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the classical fidelity threshold achievable by two cheating parties who can perform arbitrary local operations and classical communication ( locc ) but are not able to share entanglement , nor to directly transmit quantum systems @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath7 is a sufficient condition for entanglement between alice and bob ; it is not a necessary condition because one can have lower - than - classical fidelities even using an entangled state .",
    "this is due to the fact that the braunstein - kimble protocol chooses specific combinations of quadratures , and therefore @xmath4 , differently from entanglement , is not a local symplectic invariant : if the protocol employs combinations of quadratures which are inappropriate for the given shared entangled state , the resulting @xmath4 is very low .",
    "the difference between of teleportation fidelity and entanglement opens two problems : i ) the determination of the classical fidelity threshold @xmath6 for a given class of cv input states ; ii ) the optimization of the teleportation fidelity , for the chosen class of input states , over all possible locc strategies . determining @xmath6 is a nontrivial quantum estimation problem which has been solved only for few classes of states : i ) input coherent states with completely unknown amplitude ( @xmath8 ) @xcite ; ii ) pure squeezed states with zero displacement and completely unknown degree of squeezing at a given phase ( see ref .",
    "@xcite which obtained @xmath9 by considering locc strategies in which one is only allowed to prepare squeezed thermal states ) ; iii ) pure squeezed states with completely unknown displacement and orientation in phase space but fixed degree of squeezing @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) @xcite . here",
    "we restrict to input coherent states , which represent the basic resource for many quantum communication schemes @xcite .",
    "the improvement of the teleportation of coherent states by means of local operations and its relation with the entanglement of the shared entangled state has been already discussed in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that in some cases the fidelity of teleportation may be improved by local squeezing transformations , while ref .",
    "@xcite showed that in the case of a shared asymmetric mixed entangled resource , teleportation fidelity can be improved even by a local _ noisy _ operation .",
    "@xcite then considered the class of local trace - preserving gaussian completely positive ( tgcp ) maps ( those performed by first adding ancillary systems in gaussian states , then performing unitary gaussian transformations on the whole system , and finally discarding the ancillas ) , and maximized the fidelity over this class of operations .",
    "@xcite confirmed that the best local tgcp map maybe a noisy one , i.e. , that teleportation fidelity can be increased even by decreasing the entanglement and increasing the noise of the shared entangled state .",
    "@xcite , however , did not discuss the relationship between entanglement and the optimal fidelity @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite instead found this relationship , but only for a subclass of symmetric gaussian entangled state shared by alice and bob : for this class it is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the lowest symplectic eigenvalue of the partial transposed ( pt ) state .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 provides a quantitative characterization of cv entanglement , because the logarithmic negativity @xmath15 is related to @xmath14 by @xmath16 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the problem of finding the optimal locc strategy is non - trivial because the set of operations that alice and bob can adopt is very large .",
    "in fact , apart from local tgcp maps , they can adopt two further options : i ) use _ non - trace preserving _ gaussian operations in which some ancillary mode is subject to gaussian measurement , i.e. , projected onto a gaussian state , rather than discarded @xcite ; ii ) use local non - gaussian operations ( either with measurement on ancillas or not ) , i.e. , those involving interactions which are non - quadratic in the canonical coordinates .",
    "the first class of maps , together with tgcp maps , forms the most general class of gaussian completely positive ( gcp ) operations , capable of preserving the gaussian nature of the state shared by alice and bob .",
    "non - gaussian operations instead will transform the initial gaussian bipartite state of alice and bob into a non - gaussian one , and they can also increase the fidelity of teleportation in some cases @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we generalize in various directions the results of refs .",
    "we show that if alice and bob share a bipartite gaussian state with a given @xmath14 and one restricts to local gcp maps which preserve such a gaussian nature , the optimized fidelity always satisfies @xmath17 we also show that the upper bound is reached iff alice and bob share a symmetric entangled state",
    ". moreover we determine the optimal local transformations at alice and bob sites and the corresponding value of @xmath12 as a function of the symplectic invariants of the shared cv entangled state when one restricts to local tgcp maps .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we provide the basic definitions of the problem , in sec .",
    "iii we prove and discuss the lower and upper bounds for the optimal teleportation fidelity for a given shared entanglement . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the properties of the optimal local map and derive its explicit form in the case of tgcp maps .",
    "v is for concluding remarks .",
    "the protocol for a perfect cv quantum teleportation based on ideal einstein - podolski - rosen ( epr ) correlations has been introduced by vaidman @xcite , and then adapted to the finite correlations of a two - mode squeezed states by braunstein and kimble @xcite .",
    "the idea can be easily shown in the heisenberg picture .",
    "we consider two cv systems , each described by a pair of conjugate dimensionless quadratures @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "introducing the vector @xmath21 , we can write the canonical commutation relations as @xmath22=i\\mathcal{j}% _ { lm}$ ] ( @xmath23 ) , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denotes the usual direct sum operation .",
    "alice and bob share a bipartite cv state with epr - like correlations , i.e. , a state which can be considered as an approximate simultaneous eigenstate of the combinations of quadratures @xmath26 and @xmath27 , so that the variances of these two combinations are both close to zero .",
    "alice also possesses an unknown input state with quadratures @xmath28 which she wants to teleport to bob .",
    "alice mixes the input mode with her part of the entangled state via a balanced beam splitter and she carries out a homodyne detection on each output mode , thereby measuring two commuting quadratures @xmath29 and @xmath30 . after receiving the measured values",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 from alice , bob uses this transmitted classical information to perform a suitable conditional displacement on his own mode , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .    if we assume ideal homodyne detectors on alice site , and that the shared bipartite state is undisplaced ( i.e. , all mean values of alice and bob quadratures vanish ) , the epr - like correlations @xmath35 and @xmath36 , together with bob displacements , imply @xmath37 and @xmath38 , i.e. , bob mode is described by a pair of conjugate variables very close to those of the input mode . in the schrdinger picture , this is equivalent to teleport the input state to bob with a fidelity very close to one .",
    "we restrict to the case when the state shared by alice and bob @xmath39 is gaussian , where a compact expression of the resulting fidelity of teleportation can be derived @xcite .",
    "a bipartite cv state @xmath40 is gaussian if its wigner characteristic function @xmath41 $ ] ( where @xmath42 is the vector of phase - space variables corresponding to @xmath43 ) , is gaussian , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "we have assumed that alice and bob share a zero - displacement state , implying @xmath45 .",
    "therefore @xmath40 is fully characterized only by its correlation matrix ( cm ) @xmath46 , whose generic element is defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "the cm satisfies the uncertainty principle @xmath49 @xcite , and can always be put in the block form @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "are @xmath53 real matrices . using characteristic functions ,",
    "it is straightforward to prove @xcite that , if the input state is a single - mode gaussian state with cm @xmath54 , the fidelity of teleportation is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 with @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath53 matrix @xmath58 is semipositive definite , @xmath59 , it describes the noise added to the teleported state , and it is equal to zero only in the ideal situation of perfect epr correlations between alice and bob .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , we shall restrict to the case of input coherent states , @xmath60 , so that eq .",
    "( [ fid ] ) reduces to @xmath61 the problem afforded in this paper , i.e. , the maximization of the teleportation fidelity over all possible gaussian locc strategies for a given alice - bob entanglement , therefore means to determine the optimal local transformation of matrices @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath52 which makes @xmath58 as small as possible .    as showed in @xcite ,",
    "using an unbalanced beam splitter is equivalent , for the teleportation protocol , to a squeezing operation by alice .",
    "therefore the optimization over all alice and bob local operations includes also any eventual modification of the beam splitter used for the joint homodyne measurement .",
    "in this section we prove eq .",
    "( [ lowupp ] ) , i.e. , the upper and lower bounds for the fidelity of teleportation for input coherent states .",
    "an important preliminary result enabling us to derive the two bounds is the fact that the optimal noise matrix @xmath58 is very simple : in fact , the maximum teleportation fidelity is obtained when @xmath58 is proportional to the @xmath53 identity matrix @xmath64 . more precisely , we have the following    if @xmath65 is an optimal local gcp map which gives the maximum of the fidelity @xmath66 for the teleportation of a coherent state , then the resulting noise matrix is a multiple of the identity , that is @xmath67 .",
    "[ lemn ]    first of all we observe that for a @xmath68 , symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix like @xmath58 , the condition @xmath69 is equivalent to @xmath70 .",

    "we do this by reductio ad absurdum supposing that @xmath65 gives a noise matrix with @xmath72 .",
    "however , within the class of local gcp maps , there exists a subclass of local symplectic ( i.e. , unitary gaussian ) maps realized by a generic symplectic @xmath73 on bob mode , and the associated symplectic map @xmath74 on alice mode , which act as an _ effective _ symplectic transformation on @xmath75 , @xmath76 ( see eq .",

    "in fact , by mixing at a balanced beam splitter her mode of the bipartite state shared with bob and one part of the two - mode squeezed state , and performing homodyne measurements at the output , bob mode gets entangled with the remaining part of the two - mode squeezed state in alice hands . since the noise added to the teleported state is @xmath67 ,",

    "we can further characterize the optimal local tgcp map by determining : i ) the form of the first local symplectic map ; ii ) the conditions under which the optimal local operation is noisy , i.e. , when one has also to add a beam splitter with appropriate transmissivity on alice or bob mode in order to maximize the teleportation fidelity . in order to do that we first need a further lemma , similar to lemma 2 .    for any given positive real parameter @xmath232",

    "( [ tau ] ) is not satisfied , there is no critical point in this interval and therefore the optimal map is just the symplectic transformation to the normal form @xmath199 .",
    "one has also to check the behavior at the lower boundary value @xmath252 , but this is trivial because this means that bob uses the vacuum to implement the teleportation which is never the optimal solution if we have an entangled channel .",
    "in fact , if bob uses the vacuum , the channel looses its quantum nature and the maximum of the fidelity is the classical one @xmath253 , which is below the lower bound for any entangled state given by eq .",

    "we have studied the braunstein - kimble protocol @xcite for the cv teleportation of coherent states and how the corresponding fidelity can be maximized over local operations at alice and bob site .",
    "we have assumed that alice and bob share a gaussian bipartite state and restricted to gaussian locc strategies , which preserves such a gaussian property .",
    "we have shown that , for a given shared entanglement , the maximum fidelity of teleportation is bounded below and above by simple expressions depending upon the lowest pt symplectic eigenvalue @xmath14 only ( see eq .",
    "( [ lowupp ] ) ) .",
    "we have seen that these bounds are quite tight and that the upper bound of the fidelity is reached if and only if alice and bob share a symmetric entangled state .",
    "we have also determined the general form of the cm of alice and bob state after the optimization procedure .",
    "then we have restricted to local tgcp maps and shown that the optimal tgcp map is composed by a local symplectic map , eventually followed by an attenuation either on alice or on bob mode .",
    "finally we have shown how the corresponding value of the maximum fidelity @xmath12 can be derived from the knowledge of the symplectic invariants of the initial cv entangled state shared by alice and bob .",
    "if one considers generic gcp maps ( i.e. , including also gaussian measurements on ancillas ) , one expects to further improve the teleportation ; in this case one should adopt the description of gcp maps given in @xcite in order to characterize the optimal local gaussian map , but this will be the subject of future work .    another open question is to see if teleportation fidelity can be increased by leaving the gaussian setting studied here and consider more general non - gaussian local operations at alice and bob site . in this respect , the preliminary results of refs .",
    "@xcite seem promising .",
    "this work has been supported by the european commission through the fp6-ip qap .",
    "we now prove the `` only if '' part of corollary 1 , i.e. , that if @xmath149 ( the upper bound of the optimal fidelity ) , then the bipartite gaussian state shared by alice and bob is symmetric .",

    "( [ vsigma2 ] ) . using lemma 1 and the explicit form of @xmath199 ,",
    "the hypothesis is equivalent to @xmath269 , so we can make the substitution @xmath270 , which is just a different parametrization : @xmath271 .",
    "now , the condition that @xmath14 is equal to the pt minimum symplectic eigenvalue gives us a constraint on the parameters of the matrix @xmath199 @xmath272 if the state is symmetric , which means @xmath186 , then the condition of eq .",
    "( @xmath273 ) is identically satisfied .",
    "if the state is non symmetric , eq .  ( [ nuconstr ] ) is a non - trivial equation that solved for @xmath173 gives @xmath274 .",
    "however the corresponding matrix @xmath275 is not the cm of a physical state ; in fact , the characteristic polynomial of @xmath199 can be written as @xmath276 where @xmath277 , but this means that @xmath199 has at least one negative eigenvalue and therefore it is not positive definite .",
