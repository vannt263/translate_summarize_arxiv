    "the @xmath0li nucleus is known to have a well developed @xmath5",
    "+ @xmath6 cluster structure and the binding energy is very small @xmath7 mev from the @xmath5-@xmath6 breakup threshold . because of those features , a breakup process of @xmath0li into @xmath5 and @xmath6 is one of the significant mechanisms of the reaction , and the accurate description is required .",
    "as one of the most reliable methods for treating breakup processes , the continuum - discretized coupled channels ( cdcc ) method  @xcite has been proposed and successfully applied to analyses of three - body breakup systems , in which the projectile breaks up into two constituents , such as @xmath0li into @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the cdcc method is expected to be indispensable to analyze @xmath0li breakup reactions .    for the cdcc analyses of @xmath0li elastic and inelastic scattering on various targets , sakuragi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have suggested to reproduce the absolute values of a lot of experimental data of cross sections very well .",
    "they have also resolved the anomalous renormalization problem  @xcite in folding model potentials of @xmath0li by showing large dynamical polarization potentials due to breakup processes .",
    "furthermore the cdcc method has been also applied to the sequential coulomb / nuclear breakup via the resonance state of @xmath0li , in which both coulomb and nuclear breakup processes were taken into account consistently  @xcite .",
    "the coulomb breakup is of a great interest as the time - reversed reaction of the radiative capture reaction , @xmath5 + @xmath6 @xmath4 @xmath0li + @xmath8 , which is one of a key reaction in the nucleosynthesis in the early universe or during stellar evolution  @xcite .",
    "so , it is important that the method could describe not only the nuclear breakup process but also the coulomb breakup one on an equal theoretical footing . in spite of their efforts ,",
    "the cdcc method has not been confirmed yet its applicability to breakup to continuum states of @xmath0li , especially breakup spectra of @xmath0li .",
    "this is a basic interest of the theoretical framework to describe reaction mechanisms relevant to breakup processes .    the @xmath1 + @xmath0li reactions are important not only from the basic research interest as shown above but also from the application point of view .",
    "lithium isotopes will be used as a tritium - breeding material in @xmath5-@xmath9 fusion reactors , and accurate nuclear data are required for @xmath1- and @xmath10-induced reactions .",
    "indeed , iaea is organizing a research coordination meeting to prepare nuclear data libraries for advanced fusion devices , fendl-3 , and the maximum incident energy is set at 150 mev to comply fully with the requirements for the ifmif design  @xcite .",
    "lithium isotopes are ones of important materials in these libraries . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the neutron interaction with lithium and associated breakup reactions are indispensable in determining the neutron energy spectra in blankets of fusion reactors .",
    "thus the tritium breeding ratio , nuclear heating distributions and radiation damage of structural materials are affected by the @xmath1 + li reactions significantly .     in spite of the importance of the @xmath1 + @xmath0li reaction as described above , experimental data leading to @xmath0li continuum breakup processes are extremely rare for the neutron energy region above 20 mev  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the statistical model , used often in evaluation of nuclear data for medium to heavy nuclei , can not be applied to the @xmath0li(@xmath1 ,  @xmath2 ) reactions . as mentioned in refs .",
    "@xcite , the mechanisms leading to three- or four - body final states , @xmath1 + @xmath5 + @xmath6 and @xmath1 + @xmath1 + @xmath10 + @xmath6 , are important .",
    "therefore more reliable theoretical calculations for the cross sections are highly desirable . in this paper , cross sections for @xmath0li(@xmath1 , @xmath2)@xmath0li@xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 + @xmath6 reactions are evaluated by using the microscopic coupled - channels method  @xcite , in which we adopt microscopic wave functions of @xmath0li with the @xmath5 + @xmath6 model and the complex jeukenne - lejeune - mahaux effective nucleon - nucleon ( jlm ) interaction  @xcite between @xmath1 and @xmath0li .",
    "the calculated elastic , inelastic cross sections and continuum neutron spectra to @xmath0li breakup states show good agreement with the experimental data at low neutron incident energies , where breakup effects of @xmath0li into @xmath5 and @xmath6 are dominant .",
    "furthermore we discuss applicability of the approach used here to the present system for the neutron energy region up to 150 mev .",

    "theoretically the cdcc calculation with the jlm interaction can estimate cross sections of the @xmath1 + @xmath0li scattering for neutron energies up to 160 mev , which is the maximum applicable energy suggested in the original paper  @xcite .",
    "however for higher incident energies ( @xmath84 mev ) there is no experimental data of the elastic cross section , which are needed to optimize the normalization factor of the imaginary part .",

    "figure  [ total ] shows the measured total cross section comparing with the calculated ones with @xmath850.1 , 1.0 , and 1.5 represented by open circles , squares , and triangles , respectively .",
    "one sees that large values for @xmath69 are required with respect to increasing the neutron energy .",
    "although the energy dependence for @xmath69 is rationalized because absorption effects become strong as increasing the energy , the optimized value at 150 mev is much large about @xmath69=1.5 . this normalization problem would be resolved by analyzing @xmath10 + @xmath0li elastic cross sections , which have been measured at higher incident energies , within the present framework .",
    "furthermore for higher incident neutron energies four - body breakup effects of @xmath0li(@xmath1 ,  @xmath83)@xmath6 are not negligible .",

    ". in the present analysis , it is found that the elastic cross sections for incident energies between 7.47 and 24.0 mev can be reproduced by the present analysis with one normalization parameter for the imaginary part of the jlm interaction ( @xmath80 ) , and breakup effects on the elastic cross section are significant .",
