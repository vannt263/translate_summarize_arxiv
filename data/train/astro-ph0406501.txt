    "vertical selfgravity means that in a direction perpendicular to the rotational plane of the disc the gravitational acceleration is no longer restricted to be due to the projected contribution from the central object only , but now can also be due to the local mass distribution , or both at the same distance from the central object .",

    "this minimum temperature compared to the today s value around 10 k implies larger jeans masses @xcite and therefore larger accretion rates .",

    "the main scope of this paper is more on the global properties of pop iii accretion discs in comparison to pop i discs .",
    "therefore we do not specify any boundary conditions .",
    "this even makes the disk models applicable to primordial bh accretion .",
    "sample accretion disc models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disccomp ] .      for high temperatures ( @xmath57 ) the models are nearly independent of metallicity , because at high temperatures the opacity is mainly dominated by hydrogen and helium species ( up to an order of magnitude ) . and due to the @xmath58 proportionality a change in @xmath59 by one order of magnitude changes the temperature only by a factor of 1.8 provided @xmath60 remains constant .",
    "one striking feature in the temperature @xmath61 plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : properties ] is the isothermal behaviour of the outer parts of pop iii discs .",
    "the temperature seems to be locked to approximately 3000 k. inspecting the energy equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) and replacing @xmath62 by @xmath63 with @xmath64 , we get : @xmath65 for all absorption effects the exponent @xmath66 remains smaller than unity but the temperature dependence is far stronger .",
    "this is because at temperatures of a few 1000 k , @xmath36 absorption is dominant . in the optical thin part ( where planck mean values apply )",
    "this absorption has a temperature dependence @xmath67 .",
    "the high value of @xmath68 ensures that then the exponent of the last equation is nearly zero and thus all radial dependencies vanish .",
    "the disc is isothermal in radial direction .",
    "such a temperature locking has also been shown for the spherical collapse calculations of @xcite in the photosphere of the accretion shock of an evolving primordial star .",
    "although the mechanism ( @xmath69 absorption ) is the same , the isothermality for disk accretion is the property of the mid - plane temperature , while for spherical accretion this is evident in the photosphere of the evolving star .    approximating the @xmath36 opacity ( neglecting density dependence , @xmath70 ) we have @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "following our argumentation above we get @xmath74^\\frac{1}{3+b_{{\\mathrm{p}}}}\\ ] ]    in today s accretion discs at 3000 k molecular opacities of @xmath75 and @xmath76 soften the temperature dependence and therefore let the temperature decrease significantly . with decreasing temperature we get into the region of dust opacity which does not provide these steep temperature gradients .      as one consequence of this radial isothermality in pop iii discs the relative disc thickness @xmath77 increases as the disc is optically thin and @xmath78 . for constant @xmath47",
    "we have @xmath79 .",
    "this leads to the break - down of the thin - disc approximation as @xmath77 reaches and exceeds unity .",
    "the other consequence is the radial decline of the surface density @xmath80 .",
    "we use the angular momentum equation ( [ eq : angmom ] ) and get @xmath81 and with isothermality @xmath82 .    in the dust opacity disc models",
    "the temperature is not constant in the outer disc",
    ". therefore @xmath77 decreases with the onset of vertical selfgravity , as then @xmath83 .      between the hot inner part and the isothermal outer part , stationary pop iii discs have an intermediate region , where the disc can cool below the 3000 k of the outer parts .",
    "this is mainly due to the onset of cia absorption .",
    "but as the density decreases , cia absorption gets less and less efficient ( absorption coefficient proportional to the product of number densities of the contributing absorbers ) . at a certain point",
    "the absorption is so inefficient that the disc becomes optically thin and the absorption turns into optically thin emission .",
    "the temperature has to rise again until it reaches that of the temperature locked outer region . the minimal temperature decreases with increasing accretion rate as then more and more material is accreted .",
    "therefore the densities get higher and so does absorption .",
    "figure [ fig : toomre ] shows the toomre parameter for pop iii and pop i discs .",
    "while the toomre parameter decreases monotonically for pop i discs ( as temperature does ) there is a difference in the pop iii case .",
    "the temperature reaches a minimum value and so does the toomre parameter .    with the analytical considerations of sect .",
    "[ sect : hr ] we can write the toomre parameter ( [ eq : toomre ] ) for the optically thin isothermal outer region as @xmath84    for accretion rates in excess of @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) the necessary condition for fragmentation is fulfilled in the pop iii case .    in isothermal regions",
    "the toomre parameter depends only on radially constant quantities .",
    "the surface density @xmath60 and the rotation frequency @xmath55 both show the same radial dependence which cancels in eq .",
    "( [ eq : toomre ] ) .",
    "the maximum value of the viscosity parameter for marginally stable , selfgravitating discs is still a matter of debate : @xcite use @xmath87 , following @xcite , while @xcite finds analytically @xmath88 and numerically @xmath89 ( see his sect .",
    "4.1 ) . by using @xmath86",
    "we underestimate his critical accretion rate for fragmentation by a factor of order unity .",
    "given the fact that the true critical toomre parameter is still under debate ( cf .",
    "[ sect : toomre ] ) , using @xmath86 seems to us to be adequate . using @xmath87 for marginal selfgravity , as tan & blackman",
    "do , rises the critical accretion rate by a about one and a half orders of magnitude .",
    "the role of selfgravity in pop iii is different compared to those found in pop i. usual low - temperature dust dominated pop i discs become vertically selfgravitating ( ksg ) as the disc mass exceeds the fraction @xmath90 of the accreting mass and become fully selfgravitating ( fsg ) for disc masses larger than the accreting mass while remaining vertical selfgravitating .",
    "however , in the pop iii case the outer parts can be fsg while not any more being ksg due to the local mass density .",
    "this can be understood by examining the ratio @xmath91 for the pop i case , due to cooling we have the decrease of the disc @xmath77 ratio ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) . with assuming the surface density @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) , the density is @xmath96 .",
    "the ratio @xmath97 increases with radius provided @xmath98 which is mostly satisfied in the pop i case .",
    "the scaling in pop iii is different . @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( see sect .  [",

    "once the disc reaches the temperature - locked region ( sect .",
    "[ sect : isothermality ] ) , @xmath102 .",
    "the vertical selfgravity is diminishing , while the disc mass in the isothermal part still increases .",
    "( @xmath103 ) .",
    "thus in the presence of pop iii matter one needs to distinguish between the local @xmath54-criterion ( @xmath104 ) and the global fsg - criterion @xmath105 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : properties ] we already indicate thermal instabilities .",
    "we now want to examine the effect of these instabilities by varying the accretion rate @xmath106 at given radial distance as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : msigma ] .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : stabvisc ] ) the disc is viscously unstable for negative @xmath50-@xmath60 slope .",
    "this is the case at very high accretion rates ( lightman - eardley instability ) in both chemical compositions and also at some kinks in the molecular opacities of pop i material . in our pop iii disc models",
    "we do not find any viscous instabilities except at the turning points between the thermally stable and unstable solutions .",
    "[ fig : msigma ] shows that limit cycles are present . for both pop i and pop iii matter the limit cycles are mainly due to @xmath107-absorption .",
    "the influence of molecular lines ( tio , co , etc . ) , however , causes further kinks at lower accretion rates and prevents pop i disks from undergoing large @xmath108 - @xmath109 outbursts . for pop iii",
    "no such molecular lines are present at these temperatures ( @xmath110 lines set in at lower temperatures ) . at the transition from the intermediate cia",
    "cooled region of the disc to the isothermal outer disc there is an additional thermal instability present .",
    "this instability arises because at this temperatures @xmath110 dissociates while the contribution of atomic hydrogen to the opacity is not yet that large .      for the assumptions in our disc model ( hydrostatic , thermal and chemical equilibrium , 1 + 1d one - zone approximation ) we need @xmath111 to be satisfied .",
    "we show the timescales for sample models in fig .",
    "[ fig : timescale ] .",
    "the chemical equilibrium is implicitly assumed to be fullfilled everywhere except where we have a significant abundance of @xmath35 . in this domain",
    "we plot the @xmath35 formation timescale .",
    "otherwise there are only ionic and/or ion - neutral chemical rections which proceed on timescales much smaller than timescales present in the disc .",
    "the assumption of chemical equilibrium is satisfied even in the pop iii case .",
    "the @xmath35 formation timescale is orders of magnitudes smaller than the vertical timescale except in the outer regions of the disc .",
    "as long as the density is high enough , the 3-body reactions rapidly convert atomic into molecular hydrogen . in the outer parts of the disc , where @xmath112 increases , the strong density dependence of the 3-body reaction time scale can be seen .",
    "however , our @xmath35 formation timescale should only be used with care .",
    "our assumption is that this timescale equals the chemical reaction timescale . in general",
    "we only could assume that @xmath112 is a lower limit to the chemical reaction timescale as the consumed @xmath113 still has to be depleted to reach chemical equilibrium .",
    "as , however , @xmath112 is several orders of magnitude smaller than the hydrostativ timescale , atomic hydrogen has got time enough to be sufficiently depleted not influencing the opacity and therefore the disc structure . in the low - temperature region the only important absorption mechanism influencing the opacity is cia .    the global maximum of the absorption coefficient normalized to standard number densities approximately coincide at the same level and the same frequency .",
    "due to the quadratic dependence of the cia on the density of the contributing species , once @xmath35 has been formed , cia of @xmath114 pairs is the dominant absorption mechanism at high densities .",
    "we have shown the impact of the different chemical composition on stationary accretion discs , comparing pop iii and pop i material .",
    "this is mainly due to the lack of dust and heavier molecules ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 , etc . )",
    "absorption at low temperatures .",
    "while the inner ( hot ) parts of pop iii discs do not largely differ from pop i discs due to the dominant influence of hydrogen and helium species on the absorption , pop iii are optically thin and isothermal in their outer parts because of temperature locking due to @xmath107-absorption in the absence of dust .",
    "this leads to the breakdown of the thin - disc approximation as @xmath77 increases proportional to @xmath115 .",
    "pop i discs do not have this locking mechanism .",
    "therefore @xmath77 decreases with the onset of the vertical selfgravity .",
    "this considerable flaring may lead to a disc structure modified by irradiation from the accreting star and the inner disc regions .",
    "such effects , however , are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the disk models considered in this paper do not take into account effects due to the inner or outer boundary condition .",
    "thus for protostellar evolution the innermost solutions will be nonexistent being part of the protostar , while the outer disk regions may be hidden in spherical accretion still ongoing .    at the very outermost parts of pop iii accretion discs the thermal timescale becomes larger than the viscous timescale as @xmath77 reaches unity",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : timescale ] ) .",
    "however it remains to be shown wether the breakdown of the thin - disk approximation ( sect .",
    "[ sect : hr ] ) remains valid when taking into account irradiation .",
    "the assumption of chemical equilibrium is well satisfied for all regions with reasonable disc solutions in contrast to primordial protostellar collapse models .",
    "given the much smaller density , the @xmath35 formation timescale exceeds the dynmical time scale there .",
    "pop iii discs have intermediate regions , where they are able to cool below the 3440 k of the outer temperature - locked zones , where cia is the dominant absorption effect . the minimal temperature achievable decreases with increasing accretion rate .",
    "for accretion rates high enough these discs do have a vertically selfgravitating ring ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : properties ] ) .",
    "this selfgravitating ring may be subject to change after inclusion of line absorption in the opacity calculations . at low density and low temperature",
    "we expect primarily @xmath116 quadrupole line absorption which may prevent the disc from reaching the isothermal outer part .",
    "as the molecular lines are narrow and weak at low densities , the integrated absorption coefficient added to the continuum planck opacities will become constant with decreasing density for given temperature(@xmath117 ) , while it does not in the continuum case ( @xmath118 ) . in this line absorption dominated regime",
    ", the pop iii opacities may exhibit the same behaviour as pop i opacities do in their dust and ice dominated regime , although at much lower absolute values .    in this case , there may be at least two coexisting solutions : the isothermal part will remain ( temperature is only fixed due to @xmath69 absorption which will remain the dominant absorption in this temperature range ) with the addition of a stable low - temperature solution branch .",
    "as mentioned above , some authors conclude that pop iii stars must have been very massive .",
    "there have been many proposals of feedback phenomena which may halt the accretion @xcite .",
    "our stability examinations show a direct limiting process .",
    "while with pop i discs the accretion rate due to the thermal instability can be increased by 1.5 orders of magnitude in contrast to nearly 3 orders of magnitude for pop iii discs , pop iii discs are likely to exceed their eddington limit quite often and therefore produce massive outflows .",
    "however it remains to be shown in time - dependent simulations of pop iii discs how this instability acts .",
    "the toomre parameter of the isothermal outer region becomes lower than unity if the accretion rate exceeds @xmath85 ( sect .",
    "[ sect : toomre ] ) .",
    "while @xcite use @xmath87 ( following @xcite ) we use @xmath86 as the value for the viscosity parameter following @xcite .",
    "discs well above this threshold accretion rate are certainly prone to fragmentation",
    ". discs with lower rates can have toomre parameter values @xmath119 in the intermediate regime but @xmath120 in the isothermal outer parts .",
    "this does not lead to framentation , as the viscous timescale in the outer parts of pop iii accretion disc decreases until the onset of the isothermal part .",
    "this means that the first stars can grow very large and that it is exceedingly hard to form pop iii planets .",

    "there are at least formally possibilities having viscous instabilities without having thermal instabilities .    the conditions ( [ eq : thermalinstability ] ) and ( [ eq : viscousinstability ] ) can in principle be expressed now depending only on @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath26 and @xmath153 with contributions of the @xmath154-gradients in density and temperature .",
