    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in the standard r - parity conserving supersymmetric model is the leading particle physics candidate for the dark matter ( dm ) of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the most popular supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking model is the minimal supergravity ( sugra ) model having universal scalar , gaugino masses and trilinear couplings at the gut scale . over most of the parameter space of this model",
    "the lsp is dominantly a bino ( @xmath2 ) which does not couple to w or z - boson .",
    "hence they can only pair - annihilate via the exchange of superparticles like squarks or sleptons , @xmath3 .",
    "the experimental limits on these particle masses , @xmath4 and @xmath5  @xcite , imply a rather slow rate of pair annihilation .",
    "consequently , the model predicts an over - abundance of the dm relic density over most of the parameter space  @xcite . this has led to several recent works , extending the susy dm investigations to nonminimal sugra models  [ [ etcarnowitt:2001ca]-[bertin:2002sq ] ] . while many of them explore models with nonuniversal scalar masses",
    ", we shall concentrate here on nonuniversal gaugino mass models .",
    "in particular , we shall focus on a model leading generically to a higgsino - like lsp . because of its unsuppressed coupling to w and z bosons the @xmath6 annihilation rates via s - channel z - boson and t - channel higgsino exchanges are large .",
    "besides , there is a near degeneracy of the lighter neutralinos and lightest chargino masses in this case , 1 2 m__1^ || , [ degenerateeqn ] where @xmath7 is the supersymmetric higgsino mass parameter .",
    "this leads to large coannihilation cross sections  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the higgsino dm density falls below the cosmologically favoured range  @xcite , 0.05 < _ m h^2 < 0.2 , [ cdmlim ] where the lower limit corresponds to the galactic density of dm ( @xmath8 ) from rotation curves . thus the higgsino dm can only be a subdominant component of the galactic dm density .",
    "however , its large coupling to z implies a large rate of capture inside the sun .",
    "hence , the model predicts a sizable indirect detection rate of higgsino dm via high energy neutrinos coming from their pair annihilation in the solar core .",
    "this is much larger than the minimal sugra model prediction and should be detectable at the future neutrino telescopes , as shown below .",
    "sugra model with nonuniversal gaugino masses at the gut scale have been discussed in many earlier works  @xcite .",
    "we shall only quote the main results here , focusing on the su(5 ) gut . in this model",
    "the gauge kinetic function depends on a nonsinglet chiral superfield @xmath9 , whose auxiliary @xmath10-component acquires a large vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "then the gaugino masses come from the following dimension five term in the lagrangian : l= _ i _ j where @xmath11 are the @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 gaugino fields i.e. the bino @xmath15 , the wino @xmath16 and the gluino @xmath17 respectively . since the gauginos belong to the adjoint representation of su(5 ) , @xmath9 and @xmath18 can belong to any of the irreducible representations appearing in their symmetric product , i.e. _ symm = 1 + 24 + 75 + 200 the minimal sugra model assumes @xmath9 to be a singlet , which implies equal gaugino masses at the gut scale . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath9 belongs to one of the nonsinglet representations of @xmath19 , then these gaugino masses are unequal but related to one another via the representation invariants .",
    "thus the three gaugino masses at the gut scale in a given representation @xmath20 are determined in terms of a single susy breaking mass parameter @xmath21 by m^g , n_1,2,3 = c^n_1,2,3 m_1/2 [ relativegauginos ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the resulting ratios of @xmath26 s for each @xmath20 are listed in table  [ tabrelativeweights ] .",
    ".relative values of the su(3 ) , su(2 ) and u(1 ) gaugino masses at gut scale for different representations @xmath20 of the chiral superfield @xmath9 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     of course in general the gauge kinetic function can involve several chiral superfields belonging to different representations of @xmath19 which gives us the freedom to vary mass ratios continuously .",
    "we shall explore such a possibility in a future work .",
    "but let us concentrate here on the representations 1 , 24 , 75 and 200 individually .",
    "while the singlet representation corresponds to universal gaugino masses , each of the nonsinglet representations corresponds to definite mass ratios and is therefore as predictive as the former .",
    "these nonuniversal gaugino mass models are known to be consistent with the observed universality of the gauge couplings at the gut scale  [ [ etcellis:1985jn][chattopadhyay:2001mj ] ] _ 3^g=_2^g=_1^g=^g ( 1/25 ) since the gaugino masses evolve like the gauge couplings at one loop level of the renormalisation group equations ( rge ) , the three gaugino masses at the electroweak ( ew ) scale are proportional to the corresponding gauge couplings , i.e. m_1 & = & ( _ 1/_g ) m_1^g ( 25/60 ) c_1^n m_1/2 + m_2 & = & ( _ 2/_g ) m_2^g ( 25/30)c_2^n m_1/2 + m_3 & = & ( _ 3/_g ) m_3^g ( 25/9 ) c_3^n m_1/2 [ gauginoew ]    for simplicity we shall assume a universal susy breaking scalar mass @xmath27 at the gut scale .",
    "then the corresponding scalar masses at the ew scale are given by the renormalisation group evolution formulae  @xcite .",
    "a very important susy breaking mass parameter at this scale is @xmath28 , as it appears in the ew symmetry breaking condition , ^2 + m_z^2/2= m_h_1 ^ 2 -m_h_2 ^ 2 ^ 2 -m_h_2 ^ 2 , where the last equality holds for the @xmath29 5 region , which is favoured by the higgs mass limit from lep  @xcite . expressing @xmath30 at the right hand side in terms of the gut scale mass parameters at a representative value of @xmath31 gives  @xcite ^2 + m_z^2 & & -0.1m_0 ^ 2 + 2.1 m_3^g^2 -0.22 m_2^g^2 -0.006m_1^g^2 + 0.006 m_1^g m_2^g + + & & 0.19 m_2^g m_3^g + 0.03 m_1^g m_3^g , [ musqeqn ] neglecting the contribution from the trilinear coupling term at the gut scale .",
    "moreover , the coefficients vary rather mildly over the moderate @xmath32 region .",
    "although we shall use exact numerical solutions to the two - loop rge , two points are worth noting from this simple equation .",
    "firstly , eq . gives a measure of fine - tuning from the required degree of cancellation between the dominant terms @xmath33 and @xmath34 to give the right ew scale @xmath35 .",
    "the lep limit on the lightest chargino mass , @xmath36  @xcite implies     m_1/2 ^ 2  (  for  msugra )  and , + ^2 + m_z^2/2 1.4 m_1/2 ^ 2  (  for  n=200  model ) [ mufromm2 ] thus for the universal gaugino mass case of msugra eqs.([gauginoew ] ) , ( [ charginolimit ] ) and ( [ mufromm2 ] ) imply fine - tuning at least at the level of @xmath37  @xcite . on",
    "the other hand one sees from these equations that the fine - tuning problem is significantly alleviated in the nonuniversal models with @xmath38 and 200 , corresponding to @xmath39 and 2 respectively  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the universal gaugino mass model corresponds to @xmath40 , which implies that the lighter chargino and neutralinos are dominantly gauginos with hierarchical masses -i.e .",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "there is however a narrow strip of very large @xmath27 region where the first term of eq.([musqeqn ] ) pushes down @xmath43 towards the lep limit as given in eq.([charginolimit ] ) .",
    "this is the so called focus point region  @xcite , where the lighter chargino and neutralinos are mixed higgsino - gaugino states .",
    "but , over the bulk of the parameter space the lsp is dominantly a @xmath15 , which leads to an over - abundance of the dm relic density , as discussed earlier .",
    "one expects from table  1 a similar result for the @xmath44 model .",
    "in fact it predicts a larger hierarchy between the @xmath45 and @xmath46 masses , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . consequently the lsp is completely dominated by @xmath15 and can be relatively light .",
    "the susy dm phenomenology for this case has been discussed recently in ref .",
    "in contrast we see from eqs.([gauginoew ] ) , ( [ mufromm2 ] ) and table  1 that the @xmath49 model predict the opposite hierarchy @xmath50 , while the @xmath38 model has @xmath51 .",
    "thus the lighter chargino and neutralino states are higgsino dominated and roughly degenerate ( eq.([degenerateeqn ] ) ) over the bulk of the parameter space for both @xmath38 and 200 models .",
    "this leads to a dm relic density somewhat below the cosmologically favoured range ( eq.([cdmlim ] ) ) .",
    "we should mention here that unlike the case of msugra , there is no possibility of having stau coannihilations in the @xmath38 and the @xmath49 models .",
    "this is related to staus being significantly heavier than @xmath52 in these scenarios for all values of @xmath32 .",
    "this in fact originates from the gauge sector running of the slepton rges due to the specific gaugino mass nonuniversalities .",
    "it is for the above reason that the higgsino dm phenomenology of the nonuniversal sugra models , corresponding to @xmath38 and 200 have not been explored in detail so far .",
    "we feel that this is important for two reasons : ( i ) even though the higgsino may be a subdominant component of the galactic dm density , its large coupling to @xmath53-boson implies large rate of capture inside the sun .",
    "hence the model predicts a sizable indirect detection rate via high energy neutrinos coming from their pair annihilation inside the sun . even after rescaling by the low dm density factor",
    "the indirect detection rate comes out to be larger than the minimal sugra predictions  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) it is possible that the thermal relic density of the higgsino dm is enhanced by either a modification of the freeze - out temperature of the standard cosmological model due to a quintessence field as suggested in ref.@xcite or by nonthermal production mechanisms of the type suggested in ref.@xcite . in that case",
    "it can be the dominant component of the galactic dm density .",
    "therefore we have computed the indirect and direct detection rates both with and without rescaling .",
    "we shall concentrate on the nonuniversal sugra model corresponding to @xmath49 because it can generate radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) over a much wider range of parameters compared to the @xmath38 case , the latter being restricted to have small @xmath32 solutions only .",
    "[ relic_figs ] shows the allowed regions in the @xmath54 plane for @xmath555 , 10 , 30 and 50 .",
    "the area marked i at the top is disallowed because @xmath33 falls below the lep limit ( eq.[charginolimit ] ) and then becomes negative , signalling the absence of ewsb .",
    "the area marked ii at the bottom is disallowed because the higgs potential becomes unstable at the gut scale .",
    "we have chosen @xmath56 since the @xmath57 branch is strongly disfavoured by the @xmath58 branching ratio , along with the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( @xmath59 ) constraint .",
    "this figure shows that the @xmath58 constraint to be rather mild for @xmath56 . the lower limit from @xmath59 ( not shown )",
    "is even milder .",
    "we see from the contours of @xmath7 in fig .",
    "[ relic_figs ] that one generally has @xmath60  gev in the model as anticipated .",
    "it also shows the gaugino component of the lsp , z_g = n_11 ^ 2 + n_12 ^ 2 , [ gauginofrac ] where _ 1 ^ 0 = n_11b + n_12w + n_13h_1 + n_14h_2 .",
    "[ neutalinocomposition ] we see that the bulk of the allowed parameter space corresponds to @xmath61 , which means that the lsp is dominated by the higgsino component to more that @xmath62 .",
    "finally fig .",
    "[ relic_figs ] shows the contours of neutralino relic density @xmath63 which was computed using the micromegas of ref .",
    "it is seen to generally lie below the lower limit of the cosmologically desirable range of eq.([cdmlim ] ) by a factor of 2 to 4 .",
    "this is due to the rapid pair annihilation processes @xmath64 via s - channel z - boson and t - channel higgsino exchanges , as mentioned earlier .",
    "besides , the near degeneracy of the lighter chargino and neutralino masses ( eq.[degenerateeqn ] ) leads to large coannihilations . in view of the mass degeneracy",
    "it is important to include radiative corrections to the @xmath65 and @xmath66 masses in the higgsino lsp scenario  @xcite .",
    "we have included this using the code of manuel drees .",
    "but , it does not enhance the neutralino relic density significantly .",
    "it should be noted here that the dominant gaugino component of the lsp ( eq.[neutalinocomposition ] ) comes from @xmath16 instead of @xmath15 , in view of the inverted mass hierarchy @xmath67 in this model . since , the winos have very similar annihilation mechanisms like the higgsinos there is no increase in the relic density in the mixed higgsino - gaugino region ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "since the z - boson couples only to the higgsino component of neutralino , the @xmath69 coupling is proportional to @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spin dependent force from z - exchange is known to dominate the @xmath71 interaction rate with the solar matter , which is predominantly hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "hence the solar capture rate of the higgsino dm is predicted to be enormously larger than the bino dm of the minimal sugra model .",
    "this implies in turn an enormously higher rate of pair annihilation , @xmath72 , since the capture and annihilation rates balance one another at equilibrium .",
    "the high energy neutrinos coming from w(z ) decay are expected to be detected at the large area neutrino telescopes like the icecubes  @xcite and the antares  @xcite via their charged current interaction ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the resulting muons constitute the so called indirect dm detection signal .",
    "[ phimu ] shows the indirect signal rate contours over the full parameter space which was computed by using darksusy of ref .",
    "the signal contours are shown both with and without rescaling by a factor @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "the denominator corresponds to @xmath75 which is the galactic dm relic density assumed in this computation .",
    "even with rescaling one expects muon flux @xmath76 of 5 - 100 @xmath77 over practically the full parameter space of the model .",
    "in contrast the minimal sugra model predicts a @xmath78 over the entire parameter space , except for a very narrow strip at the @xmath79 boundary corresponding to a larger higgsino content in the lsp  @xcite .",
    "the proposed large area neutrino telescopes like icecube and antares are expected to cover a detection area of 1@xmath80 . the irreducible background for these experiments , coming from the high energy neutrinos produced by the cosmic ray interaction with the solar corona is estimated to be @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "therefore these experiments can probe a signal of @xmath82 , as expected over practically the full parameter space of this nonuniversal sugra model .",
    "it may be mentioned here that in the presence of some enhancement mechanism for the higgsino dm relic density  @xcite , it can become the dominant component of the cold dark matter .",
    "this will enhance the indirect detection rate further , as indicated by the contours without rescaling .",
    "for the sake of completeness we have computed the @xmath83 elastic scattering cross - sections in this model , which determine the signal rate in direct detection experiments .",
    "both the spin - dependent and the spin - independent cross - sections have been computed using the darksusy code  @xcite .",
    "the spin - dependent cross section is known to be dominated by z - exchange .",
    "therefore the spin - dependent cross - sections are much larger here compared to the minimal sugra model .",
    "[ sigmasd ] gives scatter plots of spin - dependent cross section against the lsp mass , both with and without rescaling for @xmath5510 and 50 .",
    "even the rescaled cross - section is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude larger than the minimal sugra predictions  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the direct detection experiments are not sensitive to the spin - dependent cross - section as they are based on heavy nuclei .",
    "for example the ukdmc detector is only sensitive to a spin - dependent cross section @xmath84  @xcite , which is much above any susy model prediction .",
    "the spin -independent ( scalar ) cross - section is dominated by higgs exchanges .",
    "since the higgs couplings to a @xmath85 pair is proportional to the product of their higgsino and gaugino components  @xcite , they are suppressed for both higgsino and gaugino dominated dm .",
    "[ sigma ] gives scatter plots of the scalar cross - section with and without rescaling for @xmath5510 and 50 .",
    "the upper range of the scatter - plots correspond to the mixed higgsino - gaugino region ( @xmath86 ) of fig .",
    "[ relic_figs ] , as expected .",
    "the cross sections without the rescaling factors are moderately larger than the minimal sugra prediction  @xcite . but the rescaled cross - sections are similar in size to the latter .",
    "[ sigma ] also shows that a significant part of the unrescaled cross - section lies above the discovery limits of the future cdms  @xcite and genius  @xcite experiments ; but the rescaled cross - sections generally lie below these limits except for the mixed higgsino - gaugino region .",
    "the dama  @xcite and present cdms limits are also shown .",
    "in other words the upcoming experiments can detect the higgsino dm if it is the dominant component of the galactic dm , but not if it is only a subdominant component of the latter .",
    "we have investigated the dark matter phenomenology of a sugra model with nonuniversal gaugino masses .",
    "its gauge kinetic function is a function of a nonsinglet chiral superfield , belonging to the 200-plet representation of su(5 ) .",
    "it is as predictive as the minimal sugra model and has less fine - tuning problem than the latter .",
    "it predicts a dominantly higgsino lsp over the practically entire parameter space .",
    "the resulting thermal relic density of the higgsino dark matter lies moderately below the cosmologically favoured range of eq.([cdmlim ] ) .",
    "thus the higgsino can only be a subleading component of the cold dark matter in the standard cosmological scenario .",
    "on the other hand its unsuppressed coupling to the z - boson implies an enhanced rate of capture by the sun .",
    "consequently the predicted rate of indirect detection via high energy neutrinos coming from its pair - annihilation inside the sun is much larger than the minimal sugra even after rescaling by the low density factor .",
    "this signal can be detected by the proposed @xmath87 neutrino telescopes like icecube and antares over practically the full parameter space of the model . for the direct detections the predicted rate after rescaling is rougly similar to the minimal sugra prediction .",
