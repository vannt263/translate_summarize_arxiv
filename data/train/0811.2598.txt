    "according to thomson s theorem @xcite , given a certain number of conductors , each one with a given charge , the charges distribute themselves on the conductor surfaces in order to minimize the electrostatic energy .",
    "thomson s result has been applied several times in the literature . in particular , in papers of this journal it was used ` to find the density of the induced surface charge in the classical case of a point charge in front of an infinite planar conductor ' @xcite and how ` the use of the minimum energy principle to explain static distributions of electric charge provides interesting physical insights ' @xcite .",
    "other interesting applications of the thomson s theorem are also found in @xcite . even though the proof of the theorem may be found with great detail in @xcite , a different approach not found in the literature , based on the variational principle ,",
    "is presented in this paper .",
    "moreover , the analogue situation for the magnetic field is also introduced : _ the magnetic field energy is minimal for superficial currents distributions so that the magnetic vector potential points in the same direction as the surface current .",
    "_ however , since energy conservation is assumed , this result can not be applied to ohmic conductors in which a steady current can only exist if there is an electric field .",
    "thus , it can only be used in classical perfect conductors and superconductors .",
    "furthermore , it must be stressed that this theorem is not incompatible with greiner s and essn s result on the magnetic field energy maximization @xcite .",
    "their work concerns currents in wires that can move in space while this study regards fixed currents .",
    "we shall prove this statement and thomson s theorem by using a variational principle for the electromagnetic field energy functional .",
    "in equilibrium , the static energy functional for the electric field in a system composed of a conducting region surrounded by vacuum , may be written as : @xmath0 \\right \\ } \\textrm{d}v \\nonumber \\\\ & &      -\\int_{v_{\\rm{out } } } { \\epsilon_0 \\over 2 } \\left \\ { \\vec{\\nabla } \\cdot \\left ( \\phi \\vec{\\nabla } \\phi \\right ) -",

    "the energy functional becomes : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the gradient operators at the surface in the upper and lower limits , respectively . since the total charge in the conductor is limited and constrained to the conductor volume and surface",
    ", one must include this restriction by introducing a lagrange multiplier .",

    "the same procedure will be applied to the magnetic field .",
    "the energy functional for the magnetic field with no time dependencies is written as : @xmath13 + \\vec{a } \\cdot \\left [ \\vec{\\nabla } \\times \\left(\\vec{\\nabla } \\times \\vec{a } \\right ) \\right ] \\right ) \\right \\ } \\textrm{d}v \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\int_{v_{\\rm{out } } } { 1 \\over 2 \\mu_0 } \\left \\ { \\vec{\\nabla } \\cdot \\left [ \\vec{a } \\times \\left(\\vec{\\nabla } \\times \\vec{a } \\right ) \\right ] + \\vec{a } \\cdot \\left [ \\vec{\\nabla } \\times \\left(\\vec{\\nabla } \\times \\vec{a } \\right ) \\right ] \\right \\ } \\textrm{d}v \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\int_{s } \\vec{k } \\cdot \\vec{a } \\textrm{d}s\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , the volume of the conductor portion is represented by @xmath1 , the outside volume is @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the conductor boundary surface . inside the conductor , we consider the volume current distribution @xmath14 and on the conductor s surface , the sufarce current distribution @xmath15 .",
    "using green s theorem , the energy functional becomes : @xmath16 \\right ) \\right \\ } \\textrm{d}v \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\int_{v_{\\rm{out } } } { 1 \\over 2 \\mu_0 } \\left \\ { \\vec{a } \\cdot \\left [ \\vec{\\nabla } \\times \\left(\\vec{\\nabla } \\times \\vec{a } \\right ) \\right ] \\right \\ } \\textrm{d}v \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\int_{s } \\left \\ { \\vec{k } \\cdot \\vec{a } - { 1 \\over 2 \\mu_0 } \\vec{a } \\cdot \\left [ \\hat{n } \\times \\left ( \\vec{\\nabla}^+ \\times \\vec{a } - \\vec{\\nabla}^- \\times \\vec{a } \\right ) \\right ] \\right \\ } \\textrm{d}s \\label{variational}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as in the electric field case , some constraints should be imposed . in particular ,",
    "due to charge conservation , the electric current must obey the continuity equation both in volume and at the surface @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the surface gradient operator .",
    "notice that constraints are local , not global ones .",
    "in other words , the lagrange multipliers are not constant but space functions .",

    "( [ potencial2 ] ) , the magnetic field must be zero inside the conductor , discarding any currents in volume ( @xmath23 ) in the minimum energy state .",
    "on the other hand , from eq .",
    "( [ surface2 ] ) , one concludes that the potential vector @xmath24 is tangent to the conducting surface . since the magnetic field is zero in the inner volume , considering a cartesian coordinate system for a given surface element ,",
    "if one of the axis is orthogonal to the surface element , the surface current becomes : @xmath25 =    \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 } \\hat{n } \\times \\left [   \\vec{\\nabla}_{\\hat{n } }   \\times   \\vec{\\nabla}_s   \\lambda   \\right ] \\\\",
    "\\label{current}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 points in the same direction of @xmath27 by definition and @xmath28 is orthogonal . from this result",
    ", it is clear that the surface current @xmath15 will point in the same direction of @xmath24 .",
    "notice that no restriction was imposed on the vector potential .",
    "therefore this result is independent of the chosen gauge .",
    "even though the proof of the theorem does not include the presence of an external magnetic field , the result can be easily generalized .",
    "the presence of an external magnetic field demands another surface integral in eq ( [ variational ] ) for currents at infinity . it does not affect the final result , however",
    "the minimal magnetic energy theorem can be illustrated in a simple system such as the coaxial cable .",
    "a coaxial cable can be modeled by an outer cylindrical conducting surface with radius @xmath29 , carrying an electric current @xmath30 , and a massive cylindrical conductor with radius @xmath31 , carrying the same electric current in the opposite direction .",
    "furthermore , for this case study , the inner current is divided into a superficial current @xmath32 at @xmath33 and a current @xmath34 in the inner volume , so that @xmath35 .",
    "the magnetic field is readily obtained using ampre s law :    @xmath36    thus , the magnetic field energy on a length @xmath37 of the cable is given by :    @xmath38    the magnetic energy reaches the minimum for @xmath39 and therefore , for @xmath40 .",
    "in other words , the magnetic energy attains its minimum value when the current only flows at the surface .",
    "furthermore , the current density was considered to be homogeneous in the azimuthal coordinate , which is intuitively the minimum energy configuration , leading to a tangent magnetic vector potential .",
    "a similar analysis for an electrostatic distribution can be found in @xcite .",
    "the minimal magnetic energy theorem can also be useful to determine the configuration of the magnetic field and surface current distribution of a superconductor in equilibrium , for example , a cylindrical perfect conductor / superconductor with radius @xmath41 immersed in a external constant magnetic field ( see figure 1 ) . in order to achieve the magnetic vector potential solution",
    ", one must solve the following differential equations :    @xmath42    however , instead of starting solving immideatly , one should look into the symmetries of the system .",
    "for instance , if the external constant magnetic field points in the same direction of the y - axis and if the cylinder is considered to be infinite , there wo nt be any dependencies on the z coordinate ( cylinder axis ) .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field simplifies to :    @xmath43    moreover , due to the symmetry of the system , the z - component of the magnetic field must be zero : @xmath44    these assumptions and constraints transform eq .",
    "( [ curl ] ) into :    @xmath45    which is the well known laplace equation . before writing down the general solution ,",
    "let s analyze the boundary conditions . at @xmath46",
    ", the magnetic field must be equal to the external one : @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , since the magnetic field is zero inside the perfect conductor , from eq .",
    "( [ magnetic_2 ] ) one concludes the magnetic potential vector must be constant inside the perfect conductor / superconductor .",
    "therefore , the solution for this case study is then : @xmath48 even though this is only the solution for the z - component of @xmath24 , the other components are not relevant to compute the magnetic field .",
    "however , the two remaining solutions can always be determined assuming the coulomb gauge and using eq .",
    "( [ equacao ] ) while the boundary condition comes from eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) since the surface current must point in the same direction of the potential vector .",
    "now everything is ready to calculate the magnetic field outside the cylinder :    @xmath49    which implies that , @xmath50 the knowledge of the magnetic field on the cylinder s surface allows determination of the surface current : @xmath51 the total current obtained through integration of the surface current is zero as expected , otherwise the energy would diverge .",
    "a more detailed analysis on this problem can be found in @xcite .",
    "the same calculations can be performed for a superconducting sphere with radius @xmath41 in a constant magnetic field pointing in the z - axis direction ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "similarly to the cylinder case , eq .",
    "( [ curl ] ) is simplified a lot by implementing the symmetries of the system . since the external constant magnetic field points in the same direction of the z - axis",
    ", there wo nt be any dependencies in the @xmath52 coordinate and the magnetic field along this coordinate must be zero .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field simplifies to :    @xmath53    again , these assumptions and constraints transform eq .",
    "( [ curl ] ) into : @xmath54 = 0 \\label{curl_2}\\ ] ] since the magnetic field is zero inside the sphere , from eq ( [ magnetic_3 ] ) , the magnetic vector potential must have the following form : @xmath55 where c is a constant . in order to prevent the magnetic vector potential from diverging at @xmath56 and @xmath57 ,",
    "the constant c must be zero .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath58 , the magnetic field must be equal to the external one : @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the solution of eq ( [ curl_2 ] ) for this case is : @xmath60 which leads to the following magnetic field outside the sphere , @xmath61 from this result , the magnetic field at the sphere surface becomes : @xmath62 using eq ( [ surface2 ] ) , the surface current density is therefore : @xmath63 unlike the infinite superconducting cylinder in a constant magnetic field , the superconducting sphere has a total non - zero electric current , @xmath64 .",
    "this current is essential in order to keep the magnetic field from entering inside the spherical superconductor .",
    "a similar approach to this problem can also be found in @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , the energy approach to the nature of magnetic fields has provided several interesting physical results such as @xcite . in particular our theorem , analogously to thomson s theorem in electrostatics , allows the prediction of surface current distributions in superconductors at equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , it may change the distinction between superconductors and perfect conductors .    in the pedagogical literature on superconductivity a distinction between superconductors and hypothetical perfect conductors is sometimes made .",
    "both have zero resistivity below some critical temperature but when cooled below this temperature , while penetrated by constant external magnetic fields , the superconductor expels the field ( the experimentally observed meissner effect ) but , in the corresponding thought experiment , the perfect conductor does not ( see e.g. poole et al . [ 19 ] ) . from the minimal magnetic energy theorem ,",
    "one concludes that energy minimization and expelling external fields are the same thing .",
    "therefore , the perfect conductors would in fact behave like superconductors in their approach to thermodynamic equilibrium .",
