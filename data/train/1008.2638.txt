    "let @xmath1 be an abstract graph . motivated by the orchard relation , introduced in @xcite ,",
    "we have defined the _ orchard crossing number _ of @xmath1 @xcite , in a similar way to the well - known _",
    "rectilinear crossing number _ of an abstract graph @xmath1 ( denoted by @xmath2 , see @xcite ) . a general reference for crossing numbers can be @xcite .",
    "the orchard crossing number is interesting for several reasons .",
    "first , it is based on the orchard relation which is an equivalence relation on the vertices of a graph , with at most two equivalence classes ( see @xcite ) . moreover , since the orchard relation can be defined for higher dimensions too ( see @xcite ) , hence the orchard crossing number may be also generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "second , a variant of this crossing number is tightly connected to the well - known rectilinear crossing number ( see proposition [ max_complete ] below ) .",
    "third , one can find real problems which the orchard crossing number can represent .",
    "for example , design a network of computers which should be constructed in a manner which allows possible extensions of the network in the future .",
    "since we want to avoid ( even future ) crossings of the cables which are connecting between the computers , we need to count not only the present crossings , but also the separators ( which might come to cross in the future ) .    in this paper , we compute the orchard crossing number for the complete bipartite graphs @xmath0 :    [ main_thm ] @xmath3 this value is attained where all the @xmath4 points are in a convex position and alternate in color ( see figure [ k44 ] for an example for @xmath5 ) .",
    "the ideas of the proof are quite similar to those of @xcite , where the maximal value of the maximum rectilinear crossing number has been computed for some families of graphs , but still are not straightforward from them .",
    "this again shows the tight connection between the orchard crossing number and the rectilinear crossing number .    the proof is based on two parts : in the first part , we show that the optimal drawing of @xmath0 , presented in figure [ k44 ] for @xmath5 , has @xmath6 orchard crossings , and hence @xmath7 ( see section [ upper ] ) . in the second part , we show that any drawing of @xmath0 has at least @xmath6 orchard crossings , so @xmath8 ( see section [ lower ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ defs ] , we present the orchard relation , define the orchard crossing number , and give some examples .",
    "sections [ upper ] and [ lower ] contain the two parts of the proof of theorem [ main_thm ] .",
    "we start with some notations . a finite set @xmath9 of @xmath10 points in the plane @xmath11 is a _ generic configuration _ if no three points of @xmath12 are collinear .",
    "a line @xmath13 _ separates _ two points @xmath14 if @xmath15 and @xmath16 are in different connected components of @xmath17 .",
    "given a generic configuration @xmath12 , denote by @xmath18 the number of lines defined by pairs of points in @xmath19 , which separate @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "for defining the _ orchard crossing number _ of an abstract graph @xmath1 , we need some more notions .",
    "let @xmath20 be an abstract graph , where @xmath21 is its set of vertices and @xmath22 is its set of edges . _",
    "a rectilinear drawing of the abstract graph @xmath1 _ , denoted by @xmath23 , is a generic configuration of points @xmath24 in the affine plane , in bijection with @xmath21 .",
    "an edge @xmath25 is represented by the straight segment @xmath26 $ ] in @xmath11 .",
    "then , we associate a _ crossing number _ to such a drawing :    let @xmath23 be a rectilinear drawing of the abstract graph @xmath20 .",
    "the _ crossing number _ of @xmath23 , denoted by @xmath27 , is : @xmath28    note that the sum is taken only over the edges of the graph , whence @xmath29 counts in _ all _ the lines generated by pairs of points of the configuration .",
    "now , we can define the _ orchard crossing number _ of an abstract graph @xmath20 :    let @xmath20 be an abstract graph .",
    "orchard crossing number _ of @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath30 , is @xmath31    a variant of the orchard crossing number is the _ maximal orchard crossing number _ :    let @xmath20 be an abstract graph .",
    "the _ maximal orchard crossing number _ of @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath32 , is @xmath33    this variant is extremely interesting due to the following result ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.7 ) ) :    [ max_complete ] the rectilinear drawing which yields the maximal orchard crossing number for complete graphs @xmath34 is the same as the rectilinear drawing which attains the rectilinear crossing number of @xmath34 .    the importance of this result is that it might be possible that the computation of the maximal orchard crossing number will be easier than the computation of the rectilinear crossing number .",
    "in this section , we show the easy part of theorem [ main_thm ] by proving that the mentioned value @xmath6 is indeed attained by the rectilinear drawing of @xmath0 , where all the @xmath4 points are in a convex position and alternate in color ( see figure [ k44 ] for @xmath5 ) .",
    "[ num_comp_bipar ] assume that @xmath36 is the rectilinear drawing of @xmath0 which realizes the @xmath4 points of @xmath0 as the points of a regular @xmath4-gon , and the points change colors alternately .",
    "then : @xmath37    since any quadruple of points is in a convex position , we have to consider only four types of quadruples :    1 .",
    "all the points of the quadruple have the same color .",
    "this case contributes nothing to the number of crossings ( see figure [ bipartite - nn](a ) ) .",
    "the quadruple consists of two black points and two white points , and the points change colors alternately .",
    "this case contributes nothing to the number of crossings ( see figure [ bipartite - nn](b ) , where the solid lines are edges of the graph and the dashed lines are lines generated by a pair of points of the same color which are not edges of the graph ) .",
    "three of the points are black and one point is white ( or vice versa ) .",
    "this case contributes @xmath38 to the number of crossings ( see figure [ bipartite - nn](c ) ) .",
    "the quadruple consists of two consecutive black points followed by two consecutive white points .",
    "this case contributes @xmath39 to the number of crossings ( see figure [ bipartite - nn](d ) ) .",
    "= 2.5 cm    hence , we have to compute the number of quadruples of types ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) respectively , and to multiply these numbers by their corresponding contributions to the total number of crossings .",
    "assume that we have @xmath10 white points and @xmath10 black points .",
    "for computing the number of quadruples of type ( 3 ) , we have to choose three black points out of @xmath10 black points , and then to choose one point out of @xmath10 white points .",
    "there are @xmath40 possibilities to do so .",
    "since , we have to do the same with the opposite colors , we have @xmath41 quadruples of type ( 3 ) , which contribute @xmath41 to the total number of crossings .",
    "the count of quadruples of type ( 4 ) is a bit more complicated .",
    "we count them in the following way : choose an arbitrary point .",
    "then choose another point of the same color .",
    "then , choose two points of the opposite color to the left of the second point , but to the right of the first point .",
    "one can easily see that the number of possibilities is : @xmath42 where the sum is induced from choosing the second point of the first color .",
    "the division by @xmath43 comes from the fact that by this counting argument , each quadruple is counted @xmath43 times , once for each point of it .",
    "we simplify this expression : @xmath44    hence , we get that the number of quadruples of type ( 4 ) is @xmath45 .",
    "since each quadruple of type ( 4 ) contributes two crossings , this number should be multiplied by @xmath39 for getting the total contribution of the quadruples of type ( 4 ) .",
    "hence , the quadruples of type ( 4 ) contribute @xmath41 .    summing up the two contributions",
    "yields the result .",
    "in this section , we show the difficult part of theorem [ main_thm ] by proving that for any rectilinear drawing of @xmath0 there are at least @xmath6 orchard crossings .",
    "this will show that @xmath6 is indeed a lower bound for @xmath46 .",
    "the idea of proof is counting separately the orchard crossings induced by pairs of points with different colors and by pairs of points with the same color ( see sections [ first ] and [ second ] respectively ) .",
    "let @xmath47 be a configuration of @xmath10 white points and @xmath10 black points . for each @xmath48 ,",
    "let @xmath49 be a line determined by a white point and a black point . for each @xmath49 ,",

    "white ) vertices . by symmetry",
    ", we only have to consider @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 be the number of endvertices of type @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we have : @xmath57 since we have @xmath58 such edges and each one is counted twice ( for the white vertex and for the black vertex ) .    an edge which connects black and white vertices",
    "is of _ type @xmath59 _ if one halfplane determined by that edge has @xmath53 vertices of one color and @xmath60 vertices of the other color .",
    "let @xmath61 be the number of edges of type @xmath59 . by symmetry",
    ", we can assume that @xmath62 ( we will justify this assumption later on ) .",
    "note that @xmath63 .",
    "thus , @xmath56 is related to @xmath61 by the following equation : @xmath64 due to the following argument : for being counted in @xmath56 , an edge should have @xmath53 vertices of one color in one of the halfplanes it determines .",
    "the only case which is counted twice is when @xmath65 , where it is counted for both colors .",
    "now , for an edge of type @xmath59 , there are @xmath66 * bw*-pairs in opposite halfplanes of that edge . summing it over",

    "we are looking for a drawing which minimizes @xmath68 .",

    "assume that for a given type @xmath59 edge , the @xmath53 vertices of one color and the @xmath60 vertices of the other color are in different halfplanes .",
    "this yields @xmath70 * bw*-pairs .",

    "we first motivate it .",
    "note that every white ( resp .",
    "black ) vertex @xmath76 serves as an endvertex for @xmath10 edges of the graph . for each of these @xmath10 edges , let @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) be the number of black ( resp .",
    "white ) points in the halfplane with a smaller number of black ( resp .",
