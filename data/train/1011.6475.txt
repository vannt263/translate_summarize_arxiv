    "<S> the energy of the single particle states is modified and thus the level density around the fermi energy is changed , which in turn has an impact on low - energy properties such as pairing correlations  @xcite , collective modes  @xcite as well as on temperature - related properties such as the entropy , the critical temperature , the specific heat  @xcite . in nuclear astrophysics , a good description of the density of states around the fermi energy ( which is related to the nucleon effective mass ) turned out to be relevant also for the energetics of core - collapse supernovae  @xcite . + despite the important role of the density of states in self - consistent mean field theories , most of these models such as those based on skyrme  @xcite , gogny  @xcite and m3y interactions  @xcite or on the relativistic approaches like rmf  @xcite or rhf  @xcite , have a density of states around the fermi energy that is too low . already in the 1960s , g.e . </S>",
    "<S> brown _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. suggested that the effective mass @xmath3 should be close to 1 around the fermi energy in order to improve the level density  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it could indeed be shown that the first order expansion of the energy - dependent self - energy around the fermi surface  @xcite produces an effective mass which is the product of two different terms , the @xmath4-mass @xmath5 and the @xmath6-mass @xmath7  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6-mass is related to the energy dependent part of the self - energy , dynamically generated by the coupling of the particles to the core - vibrations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these dynamical correlations , which lead to an increase of the effective mass at the surface , are implemented beyond the mean field . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the effective mean field theories have an average effective mass @xmath3 , the @xmath4-mass , around 0.6 - 0.8 </S>",
    "<S> . the different microscopic calculations of the particle - vibration coupling ( pvc ) have been performed at the first order in perturbation , due to their heavy computational features @xcite . however , the induced effects of the pvc on the mean field itself is non - negligible . </S>",
    "<S> since the effective mass is enhanced at the surface of nuclei  @xcite , it impacts the single particle states and the pairing correlations which , in turn , modify the pvc and the effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> there is then a self - consistent relation between the properties of the single particle states around the fermi energy and the pvc .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an effective short - cut for treating the effects of the pvc directly in the energy density functional ( edf ) approach . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the collective modes to the single particle motion induces a dynamical type of correlation that in principle could not be easily implemented in an effective nuclear interaction or in a nuclear edf . </S>",
    "<S> however , the core - vibration is mainly located at the surface of the nuclei which makes the implementation in energy - density functionals easier . </S>",
    "<S> a parametrization of the @xmath6-mass as a gradient of the nuclear profile has shown to give good results within a nuclear shell model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the first order expansion of the self - energy near the fermi energy induces a renormalization of the single particle green function as well as a correction to the mean field , which almost compensate the effective component of the equivalent potential  @xcite . in the present approach , the surface - peaked effective mass </S>",
    "<S> is included through a correction term in the skyrme energy density functional . </S>",
    "<S> this correction is energy independent and designed in such a way to have a moderate effect on the mean field .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec2 ] we will describe the theoretical framework . in sec .  [ sec3 ] we will discuss the application to spherical nuclei , in particular , to @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec4 ] we discuss the superfluid properties in connection with the surface - peaked effective mass , both at @xmath10 and at finite temperature . finally , in sec .  </S>",
