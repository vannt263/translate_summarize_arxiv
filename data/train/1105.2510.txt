    "the sommerfeld electron gas model@xcite has proved to be very useful in describing many of the electronic properties of metallic solids .",
    "it represents the conduction electrons as a zero temperature ensemble of point charged fermions moving against a continuous neutralizing background that plays the role of the ionic lattice . in the simplest version of the model",
    ", fermions are considered spinless and the background is just characterized by a dielectric constant . if we have @xmath0 fermions of mass @xmath1 each one carrying a charge @xmath2 , then the system hamiltonian reads @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the pair potential given by @xmath5 where @xmath6  with @xmath7 the position of the @xmath8th - particle and @xmath9 denoting the dielectric constant .",
    "the equilibrium behavior of this system has been widely studied through quantal monte carlo simulations@xcite,@xcite and also from a variety of many - body theories@xcite-@xcite .",
    "many of them center on the pair distribution functions ( pdf)@xcite .",
    "if the we denote @xmath10 the @xmath0-body wave function then the pair distribution function is given @xmath11 where the integrations are over the whole volume and @xmath12 is the one point distribution function .",
    "the function @xmath13 is the pair correlation function  ( pcf ) . for homogenous systems (",
    "as will be  considered here ) @xmath14 gives the electrons number density @xmath15 ( @xmath16 system volume ) and the pdf and pcf depend only on the particles separation : @xmath17 .    for the homogeneous electron gas in three and lower dimensions , the pdf as well",
    "its fourier transform , the static structure factor @xmath18 , have been studied by several authors using diverse analytical techniques@xcite and also simulations methods . in 3d , we mention random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations@xcite , diagrammatic ladder approximations@xcite , the local - field based method of singwi , tosi , land and sjlander ( stls)@xcite , calculations with quantum hypernetted chain equations ( qhnc)@xcite and also techniques that use parameterized pdf , the parameters being determined from known independent theoretical or simulation results@xcite-@xcite . from the side of monte carlo quantum simulations in both -the variational and diffusion- versions , the work by ortiz and ballone@xcite extends in several ways previous results of ceperley and alder@xcite,@xcite .",
    "most of these approaches lean on the variational principle according to which the energy of the ground state @xmath19 is a lower bound for the hamiltonian mean value as calculated using any trial wave function @xmath20 : @xmath21 as trial function a factorized form @xmath22 is frequently used . here @xmath23 denotes the system wave function when the interactions are turned off ( @xmath24 ) .",

    "( [ 6]-[8 ] ) with the parameters obtained by optimizing the system energy by means of a genetic algorithm .",
    "genetic algorithms@xcite-@xcite form part , together with evolutionary programming@xcite,@xcite , game - playing strategies@xcite , genetic programming@xcite and other related techniques ,  of  a relatively new class of optimization algorithms which are based on the darwinian evolution principle@xcite .",
    "in particular , genetic algorithms tackle even complex problems with surprising efficiency and robustness . in physics",
    "they have been used in calculations that involve from simple quantum systems@xcite to astrophysical systems@xcite , running through lattice models for spin glasses@xcite , molecules@xcite and clusters@xcite .",
    "more recently@xcite we have developed a genetic algorithm for the pdf of the one - dimensional electron gas in what , at our knowledge , is the first application of this kind of algorithm to describe many - body systems in the thermodynamic limit ..    in general ,",
    "a genetic algorithm is based on three main statements :    \\a ) it is a process that works at the chromosomic level .",
    "each individual is codified as a set of chromosomes .",
    "\\b ) the process follows the darwinian theory of evolution , say , the survival and reproduction of those individuals that best adapt in a changing environment .",
    "\\c ) the evolutionary process takes place at the reproduction stage .",
    "it is in this stage when mutation and crossover occurs . as a result",
    ", the progeny chromosomes can differ from their parents ones .",
    "starting from a guess initial population , a genetic algorithm basically generates consecutive generations ( offprints ) .",
    "these are formed by a set of chromosomes , or character ( genes ) chains , which represent possible solutions to the problem under consideration . at each algorithm step , a fitness function is applied to the whole set of chromosomes of the corresponding generation in order to check the goodness of the codified solution . then , according to their fitting capacity , couples of chromosomes , to which the crossover operator will be applied , are chosen .",
    "also , at each step , a mutation operator is applied to a number of randomly chosen chromosomes .",
    "the two most commonly used methods to randomly select the chromosomes are :    \\i ) _ the roulette wheel algorithm_. it consists in building a roulette , so that to each chromosome corresponds a circular sector proportional to its fitness .",
    "\\ii ) _ the tournament method_. after shuffling the population , their chromosomes are made to compete among them in groups of a given size ( generally in pairs ) .",
    "the winners will be those chromosomes with highest fitness .",
    "if we consider a binary tournament , say the competition is between pairs , the population must be shuffled twice .",
    "this technique guarantees copies of the best individual among the parents of the next generation .    after this selection ,",
    "we proceed with the sexual reproduction or crossing of the chosen individuals . in this stage ,",
    "the survivors exchange chromosomic material and the resulting chromosomes will codify the individuals of the next generation .",
    "the forms of sexual reproduction most commonly used are :    \\i ) with one crossing point .",
    "this point is randomly chosen on the chain length , and all the chain portion between the crossing point and the chain end is exchanged .",
    "ii )  with two crossing points .",
    "the portion to be exchanged is in between two randomly chosen points .    for the algorithm implementation",
    ", the crossover normally has an assigned percentage that determines the frequency of its occurrence .",
    "this means that not all of the chromosomes will exchange material but some of them will pass intact to the next generation . as a matter of fact",
    ", there is a technique , named elitism , in which the fittest individual along several generations does not cross with any of the other ones and keeps intact until an individual fitter than itself appears .    besides the selection and crossover",
    ", there is another operation , mutation , that produces a change in one of the  characters or genes of a randomly chosen chromosome .",
    "this operation allows to introduce new chromosomic material into the population .",
    "as for the crossover , the mutation is handled as a percentage that determines its occurrence frequency .",
    "this percentage is , generally , not greater than 5% , quite below the crossover percentage .    once",
    "the selected chromosomes have been crossed and muted , we need some substitution method .",
    "namely ,  we must choose , among those individuals , which ones will be substituted for the new progeny .",
    "two main substitution ways are usually considered . in one of them ,",
    "all modified parents are substituted for the generated new individuals . in this way",
    "an individual does never coexist with its parents . in the other one ,",
    "only the worse fitted individuals of the whole population are substituted , thus allowing the coexistence among parents and progeny .",
    "since the answer to our problem is almost always unknown , we must establish some criterion to stop the algorithm .",
    "we can mention two such criteria : i ) the algorithm is run along a maximum number of generations ; ii ) the algorithm is ended when the population stabilization has been reached , i.e. when all , or most of , the individuals have the same fitness .    in section iii we will apply these ideas to determine the parameters appearing in the expression for the 3d electron gas pdf that we propose in section ii .",
    "we assume that the trial wave function for the system of @xmath0-spinless electrons with hamiltonian given by eqs.([1],[2 ] ) has the form of eq.([6 ] ) where we use for the ideal part @xmath31 a parameterized generalization of an expression given by lado@xcite and for the jastrow correlation factor also a parameterized expression containing a random phase approximation ( rpa ) pseudopotential@xcite,@xcite .",

    "the inverse process is called _ decoding _ and returns the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 corresponding to each individual . in the decoding",

    "a solution is reached when  @xmath74 for some individual @xmath71 in some of the successive populations obtained in the evolution process .",
