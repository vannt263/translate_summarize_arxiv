    "the purpose of this paper is to present a novel approach to the unification of space - time physics and quantum theory .",
    "we take the view that classical space - time itself is not to be regarded as a primary object which is then subjected to some form of quantisation procedure . in our framework",
    "the central object is a mathematical structure that we call a quantum space - time .",
    "intuitively , this structure can be regarded as the space of all space - time valued quantum operators . that is to say , each point in the infinite - dimensional quantum space - time corresponds to a quantum operator with the property that its expectation , in any quantum state , is a space - time point .",
    "the space of all such operators has a rich structure that appears to contain all the elements one needs both for a characterisation of the causal structure of relativistic space - time as well as a representation of the phenomena of quantum theory .",
    "many attempts to unify gravitational physics with other fundamental forces have pursued the idea of extending four - dimensional space - time to higher dimensions .",
    "beginning with the introduction of the kaluza - klein theory of gauge potentials , such extensions have typically been carried out by increasing the spatial dimension of the space - time , while retaining the special role played by time . in methodologies of this sort , however , it can not be said that quantum mechanical characteristics of the fundamental forces are adequately incorporated into the structure of the higher dimensional space - time . nor can it be said that the space - time itself is being treated in any useful sense as a quantum entity . in",
    "what follows , however , we demonstrate that if we take the point of view that the universe is itself intrinsically quantum mechanical in an appropriate sense , then the most natural extension of space - time into higher dimensions has a completely different character from that suggested by the kaluza - klein theory and its generalisations .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "the points of minkowski space are in natural correspondence with two - by - two matrices of the form @xmath0 satisfying a hermitian condition .",
    "lorentz transformations are then given by multiplying @xmath0 on the right and on the left by an element of @xmath1 and its complex conjugate , and the minkowskian metric for the interval between two points @xmath0 and @xmath2 is obtained by taking the determinant of their difference .",
    "hermitian matrices are , on the other hand , familiar objects in quantum mechanics in their role as physical observables . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the dimensionality of the hilbert space is directly related to the dimensionality of the corresponding space of hermitian operators .",
    "thus , if quantum theory is to be unified with space - time physics , it seems natural to extend the space of matrices representing space - time points to higher dimensions , and thus to assume that the dimensionality of space - time is much larger than four , perhaps infinite .",
    "a higher - dimensional extension of space - time in this manner is also consistent with the philosophy often put forward that spinors ( or twistors ) are in some respects just as fundamental , or possibly even more fundamental , than the space - time points themselves .",
    "the framework we introduce here is motivated by the idea that the symmetries of space - time and the symmetries of quantum theory are , at the deeper level , indistinguishable .",
    "this generalised ` equivalence principle ' reflects the notion that the fundamental symmetries or approximate symmetries we observe in nature should have a common origin , and that the breakdown of these symmetries should also have a common cause . in view of the generalised equivalence principle we shall therefore postulate in this investigation that _ space - time events are themselves infinite - dimensional hermitian matrices_. as in ordinary quantum mechanics , however , it is both legitimate and desirable to consider finite dimensional realisations of the framework in some circumstances .",
    "these finite dimensional realisations are given by spaces of @xmath3-by-@xmath3 hermitian matrices . in this way we obtain for each @xmath4 an @xmath5-dimensional space - time @xmath6 .",
    "the standard four - dimensional minkowski space @xmath7 then emerges as the simplest case .",
    "as we explain later in the paper , we regard such finite dimensional cases not merely as toy models , but rather as special situations where a finite - dimensional part of the infinite - dimensional space - time is ( or effectively can be regarded as ) disentangled from the rest of the space - time . in this way the fundamental role played by the segr embedding in the geometry of quantum theory is carried over to the relativistic domain .",
    "indeed , it is an important feature of our approach that many of the familiar ideas relevant to the geometry of the quantum state space are directly applicable to space - time itself , and as such take on a new physical significance , some aspects of which we explore in what follows .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we introduce the algebraic formalism appropriate for the manipulation of @xmath3-component hyperspinors .",
    "the concept of hyperspinors as a natural higher dimensional generalisation of the familiar two - component spinors of relativity theory and as a basis for higher - dimensional space - time theories was introduced by finkelstein ( 1986 ) and finkelstein _",
    "et al_. ( 1987 ) , and we build on that work here .",
    "the @xmath5-dimensional quantum space - time @xmath8 then arises as the tensor product of the space of @xmath3-dimensional hyperspinors with its complex conjugate . in",
    "3 we investigate the causal structure of @xmath6 . this structure is shown to arise by virtue of a resolution of the vector separating any two points in @xmath6 into a canonical form involving a sum of terms , each of which can be expressed as a product of a hyperspinor with its complex conjugate , together with a plus or minus sign . in particular , we can introduce the concept of future and past pointing time - like and null vectors in @xmath8 .",
    "this structure exists despite the fact that @xmath8 does not possess a pseudo - riemannian metric .",
    "instead , @xmath6 possesses a chronometric form of rank @xmath3 , which induces a pseudo - finslerian geometry on @xmath8 . in ",
    "4 we look at the variational problem for determining the geodesic between two time - like separated points , and show that this reduces to an appropriate linear expression , despite the fact that the chronometric form is itself a polynomial of degree @xmath3 in the separation vector for the given points .",
    "in  5 - 6 we study the higher dimensional analogue of the poincar group that acts on @xmath8 .",
    "we prove that the symmetries of this space are generated by a system of @xmath9 irreducible killing tensors , each of rank @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath6 does not have a pseudo - riemannian structure for @xmath11 , the link between symmetries and killing vectors is lost in general , and is replaced by this more subtle manifestation of symmetry .",
    "we show that the conserved quantities associated with the hyper - poincar group can be obtained in terms of algebraic expressions formed from the killing tensors .",
    "we also derive appropriate hyper - relativistic generalisations of the familiar expressions for the momentum , angular momentum , mass , and spin of a relativistic system .    in  7",
    "we make a detailed study of the algebraic geometry of the complex light - cone at a point of @xmath8 , and examine the structures arising for various values of @xmath3 .",
    "we show that the space of complex light - like directions is a complex hypersurface @xmath12 of degree @xmath3 in the complex projective space @xmath13 .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath14 can be completely characterised by the fact that it admits a special hyperspinorial subvariety of the form @xmath15 . in  8 we present a higher dimensional analogue of the klein representation , and show how @xmath8 , when complexified and compactified , can be represented as the grassmannian of complex @xmath16-planes in @xmath17 .",
    "we show that the causal relations between points of @xmath8 can be understood in terms of the intersection properties of the corresponding @xmath16-planes .    in  9",
    "we show how the conformal symmetry of the geometry of the generalised klein representation can be reduced to the hyper - poincar group by the introduction of elements determining the structure of infinity for this space .",
    "the range of possibilities for structure at infinity is considerably larger than it is for four - dimensional space - time . as a consequence ,",
    "as we show in  10 , the choice of structure at infinity can also give rise to interesting classes of cosmological models .",
    "we point out that there is a mechanism within our framework whereby the same structures at infinity responsible for the reduction of the symmetry of space - time can also be responsible for the breaking of microscopic symmetries .    in  11 we",
    "further explore the notion of symmetry breaking , and introduce the idea of the segr embedding as the basis of the mechanism according to which space - time degrees of freedom can be disentangled from microscopic or internal degrees of freedom . according to this scheme the dimension of the hyperspinor space",
    "is assumed to be even , and each hyperspinor index @xmath18 with the range @xmath19 is regarded as a clump consisting of a conventional two - component spinor index @xmath20 and an `` internal '' index @xmath21 .",
    "it follows as a consequence of this symmetry breaking scheme that the points of @xmath22 can be interpreted as _ space - time valued operators_. this is the sense in which @xmath23 can be regarded as a quantum space - time .",
    "finally , in support of this interpretation , in  12 we consider maps from @xmath22 to minkowski space @xmath24 .",
    "we show that if such a map @xmath25 is in a suitably defined sense ( i ) linear , ( ii ) poincar invariant , and ( iii ) causal , then @xmath25 is a density matrix , and the map can be interpreted as the expectation .",
    "thus within our scheme an important element of the probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory arises as an emergent property deriving from the causal nature of space - time .",
    "what we aim for in this investigation is not a higher dimensional pseudo - riemannian analogue of four - dimensional space - time , but rather a geometry of a different character that , although richer in structure than minkowski space , nevertheless retains a definite relation to that space  and as a consequence is in a position to embrace the description of physical phenomena , albeit in a new setting .",
    "we find it convenient to proceed in stages .",
    "the first step is to introduce a special type of causal geometry for which the space is of dimension @xmath26 , where @xmath4 is an integer .",
    "later we shall specialise to the case for which @xmath3 is even , and introduce some additional structure that cements the relationship of the higher dimensional space to ordinary minkowski space .",
    "we shall demonstrate that when @xmath3 is even there exists a natural symmetry breaking mechanism that embeds minkowski space in the higher dimensional space . by virtue of the geometry of this embedding",
    "we can assign physical properties to elements of the higher - dimensional space .    for general @xmath3",
    "we refer to this space as @xmath27 , the quantum space - time of dimension @xmath26 .",
    "if we fix a point of origin in @xmath27 , then a point of @xmath27 can be characterised by its position vector with respect to that origin . in minkowski space",
    "@xmath7 such vectors are naturally isomorphic to elements of the vector space obtained by taking the tensor product of a complex vector space @xmath28 with its complex conjugate @xmath29 .",
    "we recognise @xmath30 and @xmath29 as the spaces of unprimed and primed two - component spinors , respectively . for two - component spinors",
    "we use bold upright roman indices , and we adopt the usual conventions for raising and lowering indices , and for complex conjugation . thus if @xmath31 , then we write @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "likewise , for the complex conjugation map we write @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "a special feature of the two - component spinor algebra is that the epsilon spinor functions as a nondegenerate symplectic form that can be used to establish a linear map from the spin space @xmath28 to its dual space @xmath37 . for further details of the two - component spinor algebra ,",
    "see , e.g. , pirani ( 1965 ) , penrose ( 1968 ) , penrose & rindler ( 1984,1986 ) .",
    "our model of quantum space - time generalises the two - component spinor formalism and its relation to minkowski space by allowing the underlying spin spaces to be higher dimensional complex vector spaces , the elements of which , using the terminology of finkelstein ( 1986 ) we call _",
    "hyperspinors_. let us write @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , for the complex @xmath3-dimensional vector spaces of unprimed and primed hyperspinors .",
    "for hyperspinors we use unprimed and primed italic indices .",
    "it is assumed that these two spaces admit an anti - linear isomorphism under the operation of complex conjugation .",
    "thus if @xmath40 , then under complex conjugation we have @xmath41 , where @xmath42 . in a standard basis",
    "this map conjugates @xmath43 component by component to give the components of @xmath44 .",
    "the dual spaces associated with the hyperspin spaces @xmath45 and @xmath39 will be denoted @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . if @xmath48 and @xmath49 , then their inner product is @xmath50 .",
    "likewise if @xmath51 and @xmath52 then for their inner product we write @xmath53 .",
    "we also introduce the totally antisymmetric hyperspinors of rank @xmath3 associated with the spaces @xmath38 , @xmath54 , @xmath39 , and @xmath47 .",
    "these will be denoted @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the choice of these antisymmetric hyperspinors is canonical up to an overall scale factor .",
    "once a specific choice has been made for @xmath56 , then the other epsilon hyperspinors are determined by the relations @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the complex conjugate of @xmath56 .",
    "if we introduce a standard basis then it is convenient to set @xmath63 , which is sufficient to fix the remaining components of the epsilon hyperspinors . the arguments that follow , however",
    ", do not depend on a specific choice of scale .",
    "the epsilon hyperspinors play a role similar to that of the two - index epsilon spinors of the two - component spinor algebra ; but it should be evident that in the case of @xmath3-component hyperspinors the algebra is more elaborate . in particular , for @xmath64",
    "the epsilon spinor no longer has an interpretation as a symplectic structure .",
    "next we introduce the complex matrix space @xmath65 .",
    "an element @xmath66 is _ real _ if it satisfies the weak hermitian property @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the complex conjugate of @xmath69 .",
    "we denote the linear space of real elements of @xmath70 by @xmath71 .",
    "the elements of @xmath72 constitute the real quantum space - time @xmath27 of dimension @xmath26 .",
    "we can then regard @xmath73 as the complexification of @xmath27 .",
    "consider two points @xmath69 and @xmath74 in @xmath75 , and write @xmath76 for the corresponding separation vector , which is clearly independent of the choice of origin . in",
    "what follows we shall find it useful to introduce an index - clumping convention ( see , e.g. , penrose 1968 , penrose & rindler 1984 ) , and write @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and so on , according to which a pair of hyperspinor indices , one primed and the other unprimed , corresponds to a lower case single vector index . thus we set @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and so on .",
    "then for the separation vector of the points @xmath82 and @xmath83 in @xmath27 we write @xmath84 .",
    "there is a natural causal structure induced on @xmath27 by the so - called _ chronometric tensor _ @xmath85 . making use of the index - clumping convention",
    ", we define this tensor as follows : @xmath86 the chronometric tensor , which is of rank @xmath3 , is totally symmetric and is nondegenerate in the sense that for any vector @xmath87 the condition @xmath88 implies @xmath89 .",
    "we shall say that @xmath82 and @xmath83 in @xmath72 are _ null separated _ if the _",
    "chronometric form _ for their separation vanishes : @xmath90 null separation is equivalent to the vanishing of the determinant of the matrix @xmath91 : @xmath92    if the hyperspin space has dimension @xmath93 , this reduces to the usual condition for @xmath82 and @xmath83 to be null - separated in minkowski space . for @xmath11 , however , the situation is more complicated on account of the fact that there are various degrees of nullness that can prevail between two points .",
    "more precisely , when two points of quantum space - time are null - separated , we shall define the ` degree ' of nullness by the rank of the matrix @xmath91 .",
    "null separation of the first degree is the case for which @xmath91 is of rank one , and thus satisfies a system of quadratic relations of the form @xmath94 or equivalently @xmath95 .",
    "this implies in the case of a real separation vector that @xmath91 can be expressed in the form @xmath96 for some hyperspinor @xmath43 .",
    "if two points have a separation vector of this form then we say that they are _ strongly _ null separated .",
    "if the sign is positive ( _ resp_. negative ) , then @xmath82 lies to the future ( _ resp_. past ) of @xmath83 .    in the case of nullness of the second degree",
    ", @xmath91 satisfies a set of cubic relations given by @xmath97 . in this case @xmath91 can be put into one of the following three forms : ( a ) @xmath98 , ( b ) @xmath99 , and ( c ) @xmath100 .    in case ( a )",
    ", @xmath82 lies to the future of @xmath83 , and @xmath87 can be thought of as a ` degenerate ' future - pointing time - like vector . in case ( c ) , @xmath82 lies to the past of @xmath83 , and @xmath87 is a degenerate past - pointing time - like vector . in case",
    "( b ) , @xmath87 can be thought of as a degenerate space - like separation .",
    "a similar analysis can be applied in the case of null separation of other ` intermediate ' degrees",
    ".    if the determinant of @xmath91 is nonvanishing , and @xmath91 is thus of maximal rank , then the chronometric form is nonvanishing . in that case",
    "@xmath91 can be represented in the canonical form @xmath101 with the presence of @xmath3 nonvanishing terms , where the @xmath3 hyperspinors @xmath102 are linearly independent .",
    "let us write @xmath103 for the numbers of plus and minus signs appearing in the canonical form for @xmath91 given in ( [ eq:3.7 ] ) .",
    "we shall call @xmath103 the signature of the vector @xmath91 .",
    "the hyperspinors @xmath104 are determined by @xmath91 only up to an overall unitary ( or pseudo - unitary ) transformation of the form @xmath105 , where @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "the signature @xmath103 is , however , an invariant of @xmath91 .    in the cases for which @xmath91 has signature @xmath108 or",
    "@xmath109 we say that @xmath91 is time - like future - pointing or time - like past - pointing , respectively . then writing @xmath110 for the associated chronometric form of degree @xmath3 , we define the _ time interval _ between the events @xmath82 and @xmath111 by the formula @xmath112 it should be evident that in the case @xmath93 we recover the standard minkowskian time - interval between the given events",
    ".    in summary , the following classification scheme for the separation between two space - time points can be enunciated .",
    "let @xmath26 be the dimension of the quantum space - time and @xmath103 the signature of the separation vector @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath113 then we say that the separation is nondegenerate ; then if @xmath114 , the vector @xmath115 is time - like future - pointing , and if @xmath116 , then @xmath87 is time - like past - pointing .",
    "if neither @xmath117 nor @xmath118 equals @xmath3 , then we say @xmath87 is space - like of type @xmath103 .",
    "note that in the case of ordinary minkowski space , for which @xmath93 , the fact that a space - like vector is necessarily of type @xmath119 corresponds to the result that any space - like vector in four dimensional space - time can be expressed as the difference between two real null vectors .",
    "any two such representations for the same space - like vector are related by a @xmath120 transformation .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath121 then we say that @xmath87 is a _ degenerate future - pointing vector _",
    "if @xmath122 , and a _ degenerate past - pointing vector _ if @xmath123 , and otherwise a _ degenerate space - like vector_. clearly , all degenerate vectors are null in the sense that the corresponding chronometric form vanishes . if @xmath124 and @xmath122 then @xmath87 is future - pointing and strongly null , and if @xmath123 and @xmath125 then @xmath87 is past - pointing and strongly null .",
    "strong null separation is the analogue of minkowskian null separation .",
    "the measure of separation , given by ( [ eq:3.9 ] ) , is nonvanishing if and only if the separation vector is nondegenerate .",
    "the causal structure of the quantum space - time , however , also brings into play the various degenerate forms of time - like or null separation .",
    "thus if @xmath82 lies to the future of @xmath83 ( i.e. if @xmath126 is time - like future - pointing , degenerate future - pointing , or strongly null future - pointing ) , and if @xmath111 lies to the future of @xmath127 , then @xmath82 lies to the future of @xmath127 .",
    "a striking feature of the causal structure of @xmath27 is that the essential physical features of the causal structure of minkowski space are preserved . in particular",
    ", the space of future pointing time - like vectors forms a convex cone , and the convex hull of this cone includes the future pointing null vectors of all degrees of degeneracy .",
    "now suppose that the map @xmath128 defines a smooth curve @xmath129 in @xmath27 for @xmath130\\subset{\\mathbb r}$ ] .",
    "then @xmath129 will be said to be a time - like curve if the tangent vector @xmath131 is time - like and future - pointing along @xmath129 . in that case",
    "we define the proper time @xmath132 elapsed along @xmath129 by the integral @xmath133^{\\frac{1}{r } } \\rd \\lambda .",

    "finslerian geometries , first considered by riemann , and studied extensively by finsler ( see , e.g. , bao _",
    "et al_. 2000 ) , have from time to time been proposed as the basis for generalisations of the theory of relativity .",
    "it is interesting therefore that such a structure arises in a natural way in the present context .",
    "one should note , however , that the pseudo - finslerian structures arising in our framework are of a very particular sort .    for a time - like curve",
    ", we can choose the proper time as the parameter along the curve , in which case the resulting affine parameterisation of the curve is determined completely up to a transformation of the form @xmath135 where @xmath136 is a constant .",
    "the equation of motion for the situation in which @xmath129 is a time - like geodesic is obtained by varying ( [ eq:3.10 ] ) and setting the result to zero . as usual , we assume the variation vanishes at the endpoints ; an integration by parts then leads to the desired result .",
    "writing @xmath137 we find that @xmath138 describes a geodesic if the velocity vector @xmath139 satisfies the euler - lagrange equation @xmath140 a calculation shows that this condition is given more explicitly by @xmath141 where @xmath142 . if @xmath143 is chosen to be proper time , then @xmath144 and the geodesic equation takes to form @xmath145 where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to the proper time .    in the case @xmath93 equation ( [ eq:3.14 ] )",
    "reduces immediately to the familiar relation @xmath146 . to prove that the geodesic equation ( [ eq:3.14 ] ) implies @xmath146 in the case of a quantum space - time for @xmath4 , it suffices to examine the case @xmath147 .",
    "then we have @xmath148 , which can be expressed in hyperspinor terms as @xmath149 this relation in turn can be written @xmath150 however , because @xmath151 we know that @xmath152 has an inverse @xmath153 satisfying @xmath154 and @xmath155 . therefore , contracting ( [ eq:3.16 ] ) with @xmath156 we obtain @xmath157 this equation shows that if @xmath158 were not zero , then it would have to be proportional to @xmath159 . however , if that were the case , then ( [ eq:3.15 ] ) would imply that @xmath160 , which is contrary to the assumption that @xmath159 is time - like .",
    "it follows that @xmath146 . that concludes the proof for @xmath147",
    "a similar argument then establishes for all @xmath4 that ( [ eq:3.14 ] ) implies @xmath161 .",
    "hence we have deduced the following result :    let @xmath162 and @xmath163 be quantum space - time points with the property that @xmath164 is time - like and future - pointing .",

    "the chronometric form @xmath168 for the separation between two points in @xmath27 is invariant when the points of @xmath27 are subjected to transformations of the following type : @xmath169 here @xmath170 represents an arbitrary translation in quantum space - time , @xmath171 is an element of @xmath172 , and @xmath173 is the complex conjugate of @xmath174 .",
    "the relation of this group of transformations to the poincar group in the case @xmath93 is evident .",
    "indeed , one of the attractions of the extension of space - time geometry under consideration here is that the resulting hyper - poincar group admits such a description .    more generally , we observe that the ( proper ) hyper - poincar group preserves the signature of any space - time interval @xmath91 , whether or not the interval is degenerate , and hence leaves the causal relations between events unchanged .",
    "we refer to a transformation of the form @xmath175 as a hyper - lorentz transformation if @xmath176 for some element @xmath177 .",
    "the ( real ) dimension of the hyper - lorentz group is @xmath178 , and the dimension of the hyper - poincar group is thus @xmath9 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the dimension of the hyper - poincar group grows linearly with the dimension of the quantum space - time itself , which is given by @xmath5 .",
    "this can be contrasted with the dimension of the group arising if we endow @xmath179 with a standard lorentzian metric with signature @xmath180 . in that case",
    "the pseudo - orthogonal group has real dimension @xmath181 , which together with the translation group gives a total dimension of @xmath182 .",
    "the parsimonious dimensionality of the hyper - poincar group is due to the fact that it preserves a rather delicate system of causal relations holding between pairs of points in quantum space - time .",
    "in minkowski space the symmetries of the poincar group are associated with a ten - parameter family of killing vectors .",
    "that is to say , for @xmath93 we have the minkowski metric @xmath183 , and the poincar group is generated by the ten - parameter family of vector fields @xmath184 on @xmath185 satisfying @xmath186 , where @xmath187 denotes the lie derivative with respect to @xmath188 .",
    "now for any vector field @xmath189 and any symmetric tensor field @xmath190 we have @xmath191 if @xmath190 is the metric and @xmath192 denotes the associated christoffel derivative satisfying @xmath193 , we obtain @xmath194 , where @xmath195 .",
    "the condition @xmath196 therefore implies that @xmath189 is a killing vector .",
    "we have taken the trouble to spell out the case for @xmath93 in order to highlight the contrast with the situation for general @xmath3 .",
    "clearly for @xmath11 we have no riemannian metric , and the usual relation between symmetries and killing vectors is lost .",
    "what survives , however , is of considerable interest .",
    "more specifically , to generate a symmetry of the quantum space - time @xmath75 the vector field @xmath197 has to satisfy @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the chronometric tensor .",
    "now for a general vector field @xmath197 and a general symmetric tensor @xmath200 we have @xmath201 in the case of a quantum space - time we let @xmath202 be the flat connection for which @xmath203 . then to generate a symmetry of the chronometric structure of @xmath27 the vector field @xmath197 must satisfy @xmath204 which serves as the analogue of killing s equation .",
    "equation ( [ eq:4.5 ] ) can be written in a more suggestive form if we define a symmetric tensor @xmath205 of rank @xmath10 by @xmath206 then ( [ eq:4.5 ] ) says that @xmath205 satisfies the conditions for a symmetric _ killing tensor _ : @xmath207 thus we see that @xmath27 provides an example of a symmetry group generated by a family of killing tensors .",
    "the symmetries of the quantum space - time @xmath27 are generated by a system of @xmath9 irreducible symmetric killing tensors of rank @xmath10 .",

    "a well - known example of a conserved quantity associated with an irreducible killing tensor ( that is to say , a killing tensor that can not be expressed as a sum of products of killing vectors ) is carter s fourth integral of the equations of motion for geodesics and charged - particle orbits in the kerr and kerr - newman solutions of einstein s equations ( carter 1968 , walker & penrose 1970 , hughston , _ et al_. 1971 , hughston & sommers 1973 , penrose & rindler 1986 ) .    in the present context",

    "thus in higher - dimensional quantum space - times the apparatus of conservation laws and symmetry principles remains intact in the absence of a pseudo - riemannian metric .",

    "thus we have deduced the following result .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for a pair of quantum space - time points to be weakly null separated is that the corresponding @xmath16-planes in @xmath17 should intersect .    more generally , the degree @xmath293 of null separation for a pair of quantum space - time events is given by @xmath294 , where @xmath213 is the dimensionality of the intersection of the corresponding @xmath16-planes in @xmath17 .",
    "the possible degrees of null separation are given by @xmath295 .",
    "if we interpret ( as usual ) the case of no intersection as an intersection of dimension @xmath296 , then a non - null separation between the corresponding quantum space - time points can be interpreted as a ` separation of degree @xmath3 ' .",
    "thus separations of degree less than @xmath3 are all null , whereas a separation of degree @xmath3 is non - null .",
    "the degree of separation of a pair of points , we recall , is given by the rank of the separation matrix @xmath297 .",
    "equivalently , given two skew hypertwistors @xmath298 and @xmath299 , each with @xmath3 indices , let us form the dual hypertwistor by @xmath300 .",

    "if a single index contraction gives zero , this corresponds to the case where @xmath298 is proportional to @xmath302 .",
    "thus @xmath303 ( separation of degree zero ) can be interpreted as the ` degenerate ' case where the two quantum space - time points coincide .",
    "as indicated in the previous section , for any skew hypertwistor @xmath283 of rank @xmath3 we define its dual @xmath304 by the relation @xmath305 here @xmath306 is the totally skew hypertwistor of rank @xmath267 , which is unique up to an overall scale factor . depending on whether @xmath3 is even or odd , we have the following interchange relations : @xmath307 thus if @xmath3 is even , then once the scale of the totally skew hypertwistor is fixed we obtain a _ symmetric inner product _ on the space of skew hypertwistors of rank @xmath3 , which we can denote symbolically by @xmath308 on the other hand if @xmath3 is odd then the inner product ( [ eq:6.3 ] ) is a symplectic structure . in this respect",
    "the cases for even @xmath3 and odd @xmath3 are quite distinct .",
    "we shall return to this issue later when we specialise to the symmetric case .    recall that under complex conjugation the skew hypertwistor @xmath283 becomes @xmath309 .",
    "if @xmath283 is simple , thus corresponding to an @xmath16-plane @xmath288 in @xmath310 , then we say that @xmath288 is a _ real _",

    "the real @xmath16-planes of @xmath17 thus defined correspond to the real points of quantum space - time .",

( there will be no ambiguity if we use the symbol @xmath313 to denote both the point @xmath313 in @xmath315 and the corresponding @xmath16-plane in @xmath17 . ) it should be evident that null infinity has a rich structure , with various domains that can be classified according to their degree of null separation from the point @xmath313 .",

    "this leads to a further simplification in formula ( [ eq:6.4 ] ) .    in general , even in the absence of such a simplification",
    ", we note that @xmath320 is independent of the scale of @xmath283 and @xmath287 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath320 does depend on the scale of @xmath291 and the scale of @xmath314 .",
    "it has an epsilon ` weight ' of @xmath296 and an @xmath313 ` weight ' of @xmath321 ( cf . hughston & hurd 1982 ) .",
    "however , if we form the ratio associated with four hypertwistors @xmath288 , @xmath289 , @xmath322 , and @xmath222 , given by @xmath323 where @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath3 , and @xmath132 are the quantum space - time points corresponding to @xmath288 , @xmath289 , @xmath322 , and @xmath222 , respectively , then we obtain an expression that is absolute  that is to say , a geometric invariant .",
    "this is because @xmath320 has the ` dimensionality ' of time raised to the power @xmath3 ; whereas the ratio ( [ eq:6.5 ] ) arises as a comparison of two such time intervals , and thus is dimensionless .",
    "the basic chronometric geometry , with infinity chosen as indicated above , admits no absolute or ` preferred ' unit of time : in this geometry only ratios of time intervals have an absolute meaning .",
    "there is , however , no reason _ a priori _ why such a ` minimal ' structure should prevail at infinity .",
    "other choices are in principle available for @xmath314 , and these have the effect of giving @xmath315 the structure of a cosmological model . in the case @xmath93 , for example , if @xmath324 is chosen to be real and non - simple , then the quadratic form @xmath325 , which has an epsilon weight of one and an @xmath313-weight of two , has the dimensionality of inverse squared - time . hence in this case there _",
    "is _ a preferred unit of time .    to pursue this point further , we recall that @xmath326 has the structure of a quadric @xmath327 in @xmath328 .",
    "more specifically , for @xmath93 the space of skew rank two twistors is @xmath329 , which is projectively @xmath328 , and @xmath326 is the locus defined by the homogeneous quadratic equation @xmath330 .",
    "infinity in @xmath326 can then be defined by the intersection of @xmath326 in @xmath328 with the projective 4-plane @xmath313 given by the equation @xmath331 . if @xmath324 is simple , then @xmath332 is tangent to @xmath326 , and the intersection is a cone  the null cone at infinity . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath324 is not simple , then the intersection @xmath333 is a 3-quadric . the resulting geometry , if @xmath324 is real , is that of de  sitter space , and the parameter @xmath334 has the interpretation of being the associated _ cosmological constant_. the de sitter group then consists of those projective transformations of @xmath328 that preserve both @xmath327 and the point @xmath313 . in fact , with the incorporation of some additional structure at infinity",
    ", the entire class of robertson - walker cosmological models can be represented in this way ( penrose & rindler 1984 , hurd 1985 , 1995 , penrose 1995 ) .    for general @xmath3",
    "a similar situation arises  in other words , the choice of structure at infinity gives rise in general to a chronometric metric that is not flat , thus giving @xmath335 the character of a cosmological model .",
    "the key point is that , whereas in the case of a standard four - dimensional cosmological model based on einstein s theory the existence of structure at infinity has a bearing on the geometry of space - time alone , in the case of a hypercosmology the structure at infinity also has implications for microscopic physics . in particular , whereas in the four - dimensional de  sitter cosmology the relevant structure at infinity contains the information of a single dimensional constant ( the cosmological constant ) , in the higher - dimensional situation there will in general be a number of such dimensional constants emerging as geometrical invariants of the theory .",
    "thus within the same overall geometric framework one has the scope for introducing structure ( or what amounts to the same thing  the breaking of symmetry ) both on a global or cosmological scale , as well as on those scales of distance , time , and energy associated with the phenomenology of elementary particles .    in order to prepare the groundwork necessary as a basis for investigating this idea in more detail we must now introduce the particular structure in @xmath315 needed to make its relation to ordinary four - dimensional space - time apparent .",
    "let us therefore consider the mechanisms for symmetry breaking at our disposal in the case of a standard ` flat ' quantum space - time endowed with a canonical reality structure and null infinity .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the breaking of symmetry in quantum space - time is intimately linked to the notion of quantum entanglement .    in practical terms",
    "the breaking of symmetry can be represented by an ` index decomposition ' .",
    "the point is that if the dimension @xmath3 of the hyperspin space is not a prime number , then a natural method of breaking the symmetry arises by consideration of the decomposition of @xmath3 into factors .",
    "the specific assumption that we shall make at this juncture will be that the dimension of the hyperspin space @xmath38 is _",
    "even_. then we write @xmath336 , where @xmath337 , and set @xmath338 , where @xmath339 is a standard two - component spinor index , and @xmath340 will be called an _ internal _ index @xmath341 .",
    "thus we can write @xmath342 , where @xmath343 is a standard spin space of dimension two , and @xmath344 is a complex vector space of dimension @xmath345 .",
    "the breaking of the symmetry then amounts to the fact that we can identify the hyperspin space with the tensor product of these two spaces .",
    "we shall assume , moreover , that as far as the internal space is concerned , there is a canonical anti - linear isomorphism between the complex conjugate of the internal space @xmath346 and the dual space @xmath347 .",
    "in other words , if @xmath348 , then we can write @xmath349 for the complex conjugate of @xmath350 , where @xmath351 .",
    "therefore , @xmath346 is a complex hilbert space  and indeed although for the moment we consider for technical simplicity the case for which @xmath345 is finite , one should have in mind also the infinite dimensional situation .    for the other hyperspin spaces we write @xmath352 , @xmath353 , and @xmath354 , respectively .",
    "these equivalences preserve the duality between @xmath38 and @xmath46 , and between @xmath355 and @xmath47 ; and at the same time are consistent with the complex conjugation relations between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and between @xmath54 and @xmath47 . hence if @xmath356 then under complex conjugation we have @xmath357 , and if @xmath358 then @xmath359 .    in the case of a quantum space - time",
    "vector @xmath91 we have a corresponding induced structure indicated by the identification @xmath360 when the quantum space - time vector is real , the weak hermitian structure on @xmath91 is manifested in the form of a standard _ weak _ hermitian structure on the spinor index pair , together with a",
    "_ strong _ hermitian structure on the internal index pair .",
    "( in the case of a strong hermition structure it is assumed that there is a canonical isomorphism between the complex conjugate of the given complex vector space and the dual of that vector space . ) in other words , if we define @xmath361 then the hermitian condition on the quantum space - time vector @xmath91 is given by @xmath362    one striking consequence of these relations is that we can interpret each point in quantum space - time as being a _ space - time valued operator_. ordinary classical space - time then ` sits ' inside the quantum space - time in a canonical manner ",
    "namely , as the locus of those points of quantum space - time that factorise into the product of a space - time point @xmath0 and the identity operator on the internal space : @xmath363 thus , in those situations for which special relativity amounts to a satisfactory theory , we can regard the relevant events as taking place on or in the immediate neighbourhood of this embedding of the minkowski space @xmath185 in @xmath364 .",
    "this picture can be presented in somewhat more geometric terms as follows .",
    "the hypertwistor space @xmath17 in the case @xmath336 admits a segr embedding of the form @xmath365 .",
    "many such embeddings are possible , though they are all equivalent to one another under the action of the overall symmetry group @xmath366 .",
    "if the symmetry is broken and one such embedding is selected out , then following the conventions discussed earlier we can introduce homogeneous coordinates and write @xmath367 here the bold greek letter @xmath368 denotes an ordinary twistor index @xmath369 and @xmath340 denotes an internal index @xmath370 . the segr embedding consists of those points in @xmath371 for which we have a product decomposition of the associated hypertwistor given by @xmath372 .",
    "the idea of symmetry breaking that we are putting forward here is closely related to the notion of disentanglement in standard quantum mechanics ( cf . brody & hughston 2001 ) .",
    "that is to say , at the unified level the degrees of freedom associated with space - time symmetry are quantum mechanically entangled with the internal degrees of freedom associated with microscopic physics .",
    "the phenomena responsible for the breakdown of symmetry are thus analogous to the mechanisms of decoherence through which quantum entanglements are gradually diminished .",

    "thus we see that once the symmetry of quantum space - time @xmath22 has been broken in the particular way we have discussed , then ordinary minkowski space @xmath395 can be identified as a submanifold .",
    "the embedding of minkowski space in the quantum space - time @xmath22 given by ( [ eq:11.4 ] ) implies a corresponding embedding of the poincar group in the hyper - poincar group .",
    "indeed , if in @xmath185 the standard poincar group consists of transformations of the form @xmath396 then the hyper - poincar transformations in @xmath22 are of the form @xmath397 on the other hand , with the identification @xmath398 , the general hyper - poincar transformation in the broken symmetry phase can be expressed in the form @xmath399 thus the embedding of the poincar group as a subgroup of the hyper - poincar group is given explicitly by @xmath400    bearing these relations in mind , we now consider the problem of constructing a certain class of maps from the general even - dimensional quantum space - time @xmath22 to minkowski space @xmath185 .",
    "it will be shown that under rather general and reasonable physical assumptions such maps necessarily take the form @xmath401 where @xmath402 is a _ density matrix _ , that is to say , a positive semi - definite hermitian matrix with unit trace .",
    "thus the maps under consideration can be regarded as quantum expectations .",
    "let @xmath403 satisfy the following conditions : ( i ) @xmath25 is linear and maps the origin of @xmath22 to the origin of @xmath404 ; ( ii ) @xmath25 is poincar invariant ; and ( iii ) @xmath25 is causal .",
    "then @xmath25 is given by a density matrix on the internal space .",
    "[ theo:2 ]    the general linear map from @xmath22 to @xmath404 preserving the origin is given by @xmath405 where @xmath406 is weakly hermitian .",
    "now suppose that we subject @xmath22 to a poincar transformation of the form ( [ eq:12.2 ] ) , and require the corresponding transformation of @xmath407 to be of the form ( [ eq:12.1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath25 satisfies these conditions then we shall say that the map @xmath25 is poincar invariant .",
    "it should be evident from this definition that poincar invariance holds if and only if @xmath408 for all @xmath409 , all @xmath410 , and all @xmath411 .",
    "thus we have @xmath412 for all @xmath413 , and @xmath414 for all @xmath415 . now",
    "( [ eq:12.8 ] ) implies that @xmath25 is of the form @xmath416 for some @xmath402 .",
    "then ( [ eq:12.9 ] ) implies that @xmath25 must satisfy the trace condition @xmath417 .",
    "finally we require that if @xmath418 and @xmath419 are quantum space - time points such that the interval @xmath420 is future - pointing then @xmath421 must also be future pointing , where @xmath422 .",
    "this is the requirement that @xmath25 should be a _ causal _ map .",
    "however , this condition immediately implies that @xmath25 must be positive semi - definite .",
    "the argument is as follows .",
    "if @xmath423 is future - pointing then it is necessarily of the form @xmath424 consider therefore the case for which @xmath425 is strongly null .",
    "then we require that @xmath426 should be future - pointing ( or vanish ) for any choice of @xmath427 .",
    "thus in particular we require that @xmath428 should be future - pointing if @xmath427 is of the form @xmath429 for any choice of @xmath430 and @xmath350 .",
    "this means that @xmath431 for all @xmath350 , which shows that @xmath402 must be positive semi - definite . since we have already shown that the trace of @xmath402 must be unity",
    ", it follows that @xmath402 is a density matrix .",
    "this theorem shows how the causal structure of quantum space - time is linked in a surprising way with the probabilistic structure of quantum mechanics .",
    "the concept of a quantum state emerges when we ask for consistent ways of ` averaging ' over the geometry of quantum space - time in order to obtain a reduced description of phenomena in terms of the geometry of minkowski space .",
    "it is interesting to note that theorem  [ theo:2 ] has a formal resemblance to gleason s theorem in quantum mechanics , which states that a map from an observable to a real number ( expectation value ) must be given by a density matrix , if appropriate probabilistic conditions are imposed . in the present framework",
    "we see that a probabilistic interpretation of the map from a general quantum space - time to minkowski space emerges as a consequence of elementary causality requirements .",
    "we can thus view the space - time events in @xmath22 themselves as representing quantum observables , the expectations of which correspond to points of @xmath7 .",
