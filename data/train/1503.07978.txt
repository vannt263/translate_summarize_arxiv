    "that means that we have dealt with both of the `` mean - field '' aspects in the current study .",
    "the physical reasoning of the mean - field - like behavior caused by the hyperbolic lattice comes from the exceedance of the critical dimensionality ( being @xmath150 or @xmath151 , respectively , for the classical or quantum systems with the nearest - neighbor spin couplings ) .",
    "notice that the hausdorff dimension of the pentagonal lattice is infinite .",
    "strictly speaking , classical spin systems exhibit the phase transitions exclusively in the center of the infinite hyperbolic lattices because of strong boundary effects . the ratio between the number of the spins on the boundary with respect to the number of the spin on the remaining lattice area inside is @xmath152 for the pentagonal lattice . for this reason ,",
    "the hyperbolic lattice becomes significantly sensitive to the boundary effects  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the boundary effects on the euclidean lattices play no role in the thermodynamic limit when the lattice size is expanded to infinity . if calculating the correlation length @xmath153 on the pentagonal lattice ( the distance between two spins measured along a geodesics ) for the classical ising model , no divergence at the phase transition was present , i.e. , @xmath154  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the correlation function was found to decay exponentially even at the phase transition , which is the direct consequence of the finiteness of the correlation length at the phase transition ( and is related to an analogous exponential decay of the density matrix spectra )  @xcite . in that sense ,",
    "the phase transition on pentagonal hyperbolic surface is non - critical , and we use the term _ critical _ for the spin models on the square ( euclidean ) lattice only since it is related to the divergence of the correlation length by definition .",
    "the identical non - critical behavior for @xmath1 has also been confirmed in this work ( for instance , by evaluating the non - divergent magnetic susceptibility at @xmath144 ) .",
    "it is highly non - trivial to evaluate the correlation length unambiguously as both of the `` mean - field '' aspects are closely related and almost impossible to be clearly separated or distinguished .",
    "an exponentially fast decay of the reduced density matrix spectra has been observed for the classical systems on hyperbolic surfaces  @xcite .",
    "similar behavior for the quantum systems had to be taken into a possible scenario in the current work .",
    "for all the above - mentioned reasons , we conjecture the tpfv analysis of the models on the hyperbolic pentagonal lattice is more accurate than on the euclidean ones .",
    "it is caused by the mean - field - like behavior ( the mean - field - like universality ) as the consequence of the pentagonal hyperbolic lattice with the infinite hausdorff dimension , which has been studied by the numerical improved mean - field approximation .",
