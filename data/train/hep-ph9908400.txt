    "understanding of the nonleptonic decays of light hadrons in the standard model ( sm ) has been one of the most difficult issues . while the sm explains the weak processes involving the change of strangeness by considering @xmath3 exchange , the description of nonleptonic decays of light hadrons is rather complicated on account of the strong interactions in the low - energy regime ( below @xmath4 gev ) .",
    "the problem is typified by the @xmath5 selection rule , best known as the fact that the isosinglet amplitude of the @xmath6 decay dominates over the @xmath7 amplitude by about 22 times . despite a great deal of effort this dominance of the @xmath2 channel over the @xmath8 it has not been explained in a satisfactory way .",
    "the effective weak hamiltonian derived from evolving the simple @xmath3-exchange - vertex from a scale of 80 gev down to 1 gev  @xcite presents a part of the answer , showing that the perturbative gluons inherent in the wilson coefficients enhance the @xmath2 channel",
    ". however , the perturbative gluons alone are not enough to explain the @xmath2 rule completely .",
    "thus , we need to consider other sources of the @xmath2 enhancement . since the structure of the light hadrons intimates already the importance of nonperturbative qcd , it is natural to consider its significance in describing low energy processes such as @xmath6 decay .",
    "recently , we have investigated the effective @xmath9 weak chiral lagrangian to order @xmath10 within the framework of the chiral quark model ( @xmath11qm )  @xcite , focusing on determining the low energy constants ( lecs ) in the effective weak chiral lagrangian .",
    "however , the ratio of the @xmath12 obtained from the @xmath11qm deviated from the phenomenological values obtained in chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath11pt ) .",
    "there was a suggestion to include the gluon condensate which is of order @xmath13  @xcite",
    ". however , ref .",
    "@xcite did not consider the @xmath14 corrections which might be of significance at the same extent to the @xmath15 corrections .    in the present work",
    ", we want to improve our former study  @xcite , based on the more general effective low - energy qcd partition function derived from the instanton vacuum which pertains to nonperturbative qcd .",
    "the main feature lies in the fact that the coupling strength of the chiral symmetric quark - goldstone interactions is momentum - dependent .",
    "in fact , switching off the momentum dependence of the coupling and adding an appropriate regularization scheme will lead to the usual @xmath11qm used in the former investigation  @xcite . due to the complexity of the formalism in the present approach we first concentrate on order @xmath16 and a part of @xmath17 .",
    "as far as the large @xmath18 expansion is concerned , while it explains the strong - interaction sector quantitatively well , the nonleptonic weak interactions defy any explanation from the strict large @xmath18 limit .",
    "because of the fact that the @xmath2 enhancement is badly underestimated in lowest oder in the large @xmath18 expansion , it is inevitable to go beyond the leading order ( lo ) in @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "moreover , if one expects a large contribution from the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in @xmath0 , a convergence problem for the @xmath0 expansion may occur  @xcite . in this case",
    ", one has to consider higher order corrections in @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , since there are many different sources of nonleading - order corrections in @xmath0 , one has to carefully analyze @xmath17 corrections .",
    "however , dealing with higher order corrections and all contributions of @xmath19 is beyond our work .",
    "thus , we will restrict ourselves in this work to a part of the @xmath0 corrections : the @xmath0 diagrams from the quark operators .",
    "the instanton vacuum elucidates one of the most important low - energy properties of qcd , _",
    "i.e. _ the mechanism of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the banks - casher relation tells that the spectral density @xmath20 of the dirac operator at zero modes is proportional to the chiral condensate known as an order parameter of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry : @xmath21 the picture of the instanton vacuum provides a good realization of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "a finite density of instantons and antiinstantons produces the nonvanishing value of @xmath22 , which triggers the mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the euclidean quark propagator in the instanton vacuum acquires the following form with a momentum - dependent quark mass generated dynamically , identified with the coupling strength between quarks and goldstone bosons : @xmath23 with @xmath24 the ratio @xmath25 denotes the instanton density at equilibrium and the @xmath26 is the average size of the instanton .",
    "the form factor @xmath27 is related to the fourier transform of the would - be zero fermion mode of individual instantons . as will be shown later",
    ", the momentum dependence of the constituent quark plays an essential role in improving our previous results  @xcite concerning the effective weak chiral lagrangian .",
    "it is in line with the recent works on the pion wave functions  @xcite and skewed parton distribution  @xcite , where the momentum - dependent quark mass plays a crucial role as well .",
    "the instanton vacuum induces effective @xmath28-fermion interactions  @xcite .",
    "for example , it has a type of the nambu - jona - lasinio model for @xmath29 while for @xmath30 it exhibits the t  hooft determinant  @xcite .",
    "goldstone bosons appear as collective excitations by quark loops generating a dynamic quark mass .",
    "eventually it is found that at low energies qcd is reduced to an interacting quark - goldstone boson theory given by the following euclidean partition function  @xcite @xmath31 , \\label{eq : part}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 stands for the pseudo - goldstone boson : @xmath33 the @xmath34 is the color index , @xmath35 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are flavor indices .",
    "@xmath38 is the constituent quark mass being now momentum - dependent",
    ". it will play a main role in the present work .",
    "this effective theory of quarks and light goldstone mesons applies to quark momenta up to the inverse size of the instanton , @xmath39 mev , which may act as a scale of the model ( @xmath40 ) . a merit to derive the @xmath11qm from the instanton vacuum lies in the fact that the scale of the model is naturally determined by @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , mesons and baryons can be treated on the same footing in the @xmath11qm .",
    "for example , the model has been very successful in describing the properties of the baryons  @xcite .",
    "we want to mention that there is a problem related to the gauge invariance in eq.([eq : part ] ) . due to the nonlocality of the interaction expressed in eq.([eq : part ] ) , the vector and axial - vector ward - takahashi identities are not satisfied , that is , the conservation of the vector current ( cvc ) and the partial conservation of the axial - vector current(pcac ) do not hold .",
    "thus , one has to make the effective action gauge - invariant . a well - known prescription to solve",
    "this problem is to insert the path - ordered exponent into the effective action  @xcite . at the scale of the @xmath3 boson , the charged - current weak interaction of the quarks",
    "is mediated by the @xmath3 boson only and thus is a product of two local currents .",
    "however , when the charged - current weak interaction is scaled down to the hadronic scale , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath42 gev , the renormalization of the qcd quantum corrections make the current - current operator mixed with other different types of twist - four local composite operators  @xcite .",
    "however , in the strict large @xmath18 limit , the contribution of all other composite operators is suppressed by @xmath0 except for the current - current one which is the same as that at the @xmath3 scale .",
    "thus , it need not be renormalized and the conservation of the currents must be taken into account .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows : in section 2 we sketch the instanton - induced chiral quark model , emphasizing in particular the momentum dependence of the constituent quark mass and explain how to perform the derivative expansion in the presence of the momentum - dependent constituent quark mass . in section 3",
    ", we show the basic formalism to obtain the effective weak chiral lagrangian starting from the effective weak quark hamiltonian . in section 4 ,",
    "we dicuss the large @xmath18 limit in the nonleptonic weak hamiltonian and the conserved currents with the nonlocal interaction .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the derivation of the effective weak chiral lagrangian to order @xmath43 and @xmath17 . in section 6",
    "we discuss results .",
    "the conclusions and outlook are given in section 7 .",

    "the original expression for the @xmath47  @xcite , which is obtained from the fourier transformation of the would - be zero fermion mode of individual instantons with the sharp instanton distribution assumed , is as follows : @xmath48 here @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 denote the modified bessel functions , @xmath53 is defined as @xmath54 and the cutoff parameter @xmath55 is in this case just the inverse of @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath56 goes to infinity , @xmath57 becomes @xmath58    actually , the momentum - dependent quark mass is related to the nonlocal regularization in euclidean space .",
    "there are other ways of understanding the nonlocal effective interaction without relying on the instanton vacuum  @xcite . in those methods , the momentum - dependent quark mass as a regularization appears as delocalizing the quark fields",
    "so , various types of the @xmath45 as a regulator with the regularization parameter @xmath55 has been used by different authors  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will not confine ourselves to the expression given in eq.([eq : fofk ] ) but rather try three different types of the @xmath45 : @xmath59    the @xmath45 is normalized to @xmath60 at @xmath61 .",

    "thus , we first want to examine the dependence of the quark and gluon condensates on the momentum - dependent quark mass ( see eqs.([eq : quarkcon],[eq : gluoncon ] ) ) .    in figure 2",
    "we show the dependence of the quark condensate on the @xmath60 with several different types of the @xmath45 given in eq.([eq : types ] ) .",
    "the @xmath45 by diakonov and petrov  @xcite and that of the dipole type produce the very similar results of the @xmath235   is not allowed , since it is not enough to tame the quadratic divergence like the quark condensate . ]",
    ", the gaussian type brings out noticeably smaller value of the quark condensate than the other two . from these results",
    "one can easily see that the @xmath45 with stronger tail produces the larger value of the quark condensate .",
    "the shaded band depicts the empirical range of the quark condensate .    in figure 3",
    "we draw the dependence of the gluon condensate on the @xmath60 in the same manner . as in the case of the quark condensate ,",
    "the dependence on the different types of the @xmath45 is similar .",
    "again , the shaded band represents the empirical range of the gluon condensate .",
    "thus , examining the dependence of the quark and gluon condensates , one constrains the range of the value of @xmath60 .    in figures 4 and 5 we present dependence of the lecs @xmath198 and @xmath199 on the dynamical quark mass , with the ndr scheme employed ( @xmath236 mev ) . as seen in eqs.([eq : lecslo],[eq : lecsnlo ] ) , the @xmath199 does not depend on @xmath60 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath198 shows a strong dependence on the @xmath60 .",
    "it is due to the fact that the penguin operator contributes only to the @xmath198 and it brings about three functions containing the @xmath60 and the quark condensate .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath198 with different types of @xmath45 is similar to the quark and gluon condensates . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath198 goes up drastically below @xmath237 mev . as a result ,",
    "the ratio @xmath1 exhibits a similar dependence on the @xmath60 as shown in fig .",
    "figures 7 and 8 depict the contribution of the nlo corrections @xmath238 to the lecs @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "the @xmath239 contribution to the @xmath198 is very tiny , while it does to the @xmath199 almost @xmath240 and thus it makes the @xmath199 deviate from the empirical value . as already discussed in ref.@xcite",
    ", the @xmath225 corrections make the ratio @xmath1 worse as shown in fig .",
    "6 , compared to the empirical value ( dotted line ) .",
    "we only can reach the empirical value below around @xmath241 mev which is not preferable according to the proper range of the @xmath60 from the quark and gluon condensates .",
    "now , we want to analyze the contributions to the lecs from the different quark operators @xmath242 given in eq.([eq : qq ] ) .",
    "these considerations are basically independent of the actual form of @xmath45 .",
    "since the penguin operator @xmath176 contributes only to the octet part of the coupling , it contributes directly to the @xmath243 enhancement .",
    "in fact , the appearance of this octet penguin operator indicates already that the effect of perturbative gluons is of utmost importance in explaining the @xmath243 rule .",
    "figure 9 shows each contribution of the quark operators @xmath242 , starting from the @xmath178 which has the same form of the bare operator at the scale of the @xmath244 .",
    "the operator @xmath178 has the largest wilson coefficient in any renormalization scheme .",
    "the @xmath245 takes the second largest wilson coefficient . as drawn in fig .",
    "9 , the lec @xmath198 is much underestimated with the operators @xmath245 and @xmath178 only and furthermore they are stable to the change of the @xmath60 . adding the penguin operator @xmath176 brings the @xmath198 up dramatically and its dependence on the @xmath60 is also very noticeable .",
    "the other contributions are negligibly tiny .",
    "hence , the penguin operator @xmath176 plays an essential role in enhancing the octet coupling . actually , considering the fact that the @xmath45 is pertinent to the zero mode of individual instantons , the strong dependence of the penguin operator on the @xmath93 indicates the importance of the effect of a part of nonperturbative gluons in describing the nonleptonic kaon decays .    in the case of the @xmath199 , the operators @xmath245 and @xmath178 are dominant and the wilson coefficients @xmath246 and @xmath247 are negligibly small .",
    "in the present work we have investigated the effective weak chiral lagrangian for @xmath9 concentrating on the calculation of @xmath198 and @xmath199 . we used the chiral quark model from the instanton vacuum as framework and incorporated the weak interaction by the effective hamiltonian of buchalla , buras , and lautenbacher  @xcite .",
    "the calculation has been done in a first step to order @xmath16 and to lo and nlo in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "in contrast to the previous work by ref .",
    "@xcite , we used a momentum - dependent constituent quark mass @xmath45 as it arises from the instanton vacuum , which makes @xmath198 be closer to its corresponding empirical value .",
    "however , the @xmath199 is untouched by the present work , so that it is not at all improved , since it is independent of @xmath93 .    for their ratio @xmath1 ,",
    "this simple feature enlarged the values by about @xmath248  @xmath249 to @xmath250  @xmath249 and hence very much improved the theoretical values compared with the empirical ones .",
    "in fact we tried various shapes of @xmath45 .",
    "however , the best values were obtained for the @xmath45 from the instanton model of diakonov and petrov  @xcite and @xmath251 mev . altogether the empirical value of @xmath1 with the @xmath60 constrained to the quark and gluon condensates is still underestimated and one is still away from an explanation of the @xmath2 rule .",
    "however , the conclusion is very clear : if one wishes to derive the effective weak lagrangian from the instanton vacuum of qcd by means of the chiral quark model the use of a momentum - dependent quark mass seems to be indispensable .",
