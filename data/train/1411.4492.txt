    "the fe @xmath0 emission is the most important line feature in the x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "such a narrow line is commonly found among seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is also observational evidence for a broad fe @xmath0 line in some active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , whose archetypes include mcg-6 - 30 - 15 @xcite , ngc 3516 @xcite , 1h0707 - 495 @xcite and others @xcite . the broad fe @xmath0 line is generally thought to originate from ` cold ' gas in the proximity of the supermassive black hole , such as the accretion disc , via the k - shell fluorescence process , illuminated by x - rays from a primary x - ray source , such as a postulated hot corona above the accretion disc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* alternative explanations have also been suggested , however ; see @xcite for the absorption - origin model and @xcite for the compton - thick wind model ) . in the presence of strong gravitational field",
    ", the line can be significantly broadened , shifted and distorted due to the effects of both general and special relativity , including doppler boosting , gravitational redshift and the transverse doppler effect .",
    "the emergent line has a characteristic shape and the exact profile is determined by the physical properties of the disc and the black hole .",
    "the energy of the red wing of the broad line , redshifted due mainly to the gravitational redshift effect , is determined by the inner radius of the accretion disc , which is commonly thought to be at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "the location of the isco is strongly dependent on the spin of the black hole ; it is at 6@xmath3 ( @xmath4 , gravitational radius ) for a non - spinning black hole and 1.24@xmath3 for a maximally spinning black hole ( dimensionless spin parameter @xmath5 ) .",
    "the energy and profile of the broad line are also dependent on the ionization state and the inclination of the accretion disc @xcite . as such ,",
    "the profile of a relativistic broad fe @xmath0 line can be used to constrain the spin of the black hole @xcite , as well as to probe the physical environment in the vicinity of the black hole",
    ".    there have been extensive studies for characterizing the fe @xmath0 line properties of seyfert galaxies in the literature .",
    "for instance , @xcite analyzed the spectra of 18 seyfert 1 galaxies observed with _",
    "asca _ , and concluded that nearly 75per cent objects of their sample show evidence of broad lines .",
    "based on _ xmm - newton _ spectra of a sample of 26 seyfert galaxies , @xcite found that almost all the spectra show a narrow ` core ' at 6.4kev while @xmath645 per cent of the spectra can be best fitted with a relativistic blurred reflection model . @xcite systematically and uniformly analyzed a collection of 149 radio - quiet type 1 agn observed by _ xmm - newton_. they found that about 36 per cent of sources in their flux - limited sample show strong evidence of a relativistic fe @xmath0 line with an average line equivalent width ( @xmath7 ) of the order of 100ev , and this fraction can be considered as a lower limit in the wider agn population . by analysing",
    "the spectra of 46 objects observed with _ suzaku _ , @xcite found that almost all the objects reveal a narrow fe @xmath0 line and 50 per cent of the sample show a statistically significant relativistic fe @xmath0 line with a mean equivalent width @xmath6@xmath8ev .",
    "it is generally accepted that a broad fe @xmath0 line is frequently presented in seyfert galaxies .    for individual objects , however",
    ", it requires a large number of x - ray photons collected at high energies ( @xmath9kev ) to determine accurately the continuum spectrum and to reveal unambiguously the fe @xmath0 line profile @xcite .",
    "this is often unrealistic for the majority of agn given the limited observing time available in practice , except for a small number of the brightest ones . alternatively ,",
    "spectral stacking is an effective way to obtain a composite spectrum with very high signal - to - noise for a certain class of objects . by stacking the x - ray spectra of 53 type 1 and 41 type 2 agn ,",
    "@xcite found broad relativistic fe @xmath0 lines with an @xmath7 of 600ev and 400ev for type 1 and type 2 agn , respectively . @xcite",
    "introduced a sophisticated stacking method and applied it to an agn sample ( mostly quasars ) observed with _ xmm - newton _ ; they found a significant unresolved narrow fe @xmath0 line around @xmath66.4kev with an @xmath10ev in the stacked spectrum , and only an indication for a broad fe @xmath0 line which is not significant statistically . using a sample of 248 agn with a wide redshift range",
    ", @xcite analyzed the average fe @xmath0 line profile using two fully independent rest - frame stacking methods .",
    "they found that the average fe @xmath0 profile can be best fitted by a combination of a narrow and a broad line with an @xmath7 of @xmath630ev and @xmath6100ev respectively .",
    "@xcite performed spectral stacking analysis of the xmm - cosmos field to investigate the fe @xmath0 line properties of agn beyond redshift @xmath11 ; for type 1 agn , they found a broad fe emission line at a low significant level ( @xmath62@xmath12 ) for only sub - samples of low x - ray luminosities ( @xmath13ergss@xmath14 ) or intermediate eddington ratios ( @xmath15 ) ; for type 2 agn , no significant broad fe line is found .    for narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) ,",

    "@xcite found that narrow fe @xmath0 emission lines in nls1s are systematically much weaker than those in bls1s .",
    "it should be noted that in previous studies of nls1s , the x - ray spectra of individual objects are mostly of low s / n ratios at energies around the fe @xmath0 line and higher , partly due to the relatively steep continua above 2kev .",

    "this is especially true for sources observed at different redshifts . in this work ,",

    "we refer readers to the original paper for details and discussions about the method , and only outline the main procedures here .    1 .   determining the source continuum :",
    "each of the observed spectrum is fitted with a simple power - law modified by galactic and possible intrinsic absorption ( po*pha*zpha in xspec , @xcite ) .",
    "only the spectrum above 2kev is used to avoid possible contamination from the soft x - ray excess commonly found in the x - ray spectrum of agn below 2kev .",

    "the galactic absorption column density is fixed at the galactic value given by @xcite for each source .",
    "the intrinsic absorption column density , the slope and normalization of the power law are left as free parameters .",
    "we find that the above model can describe the continuum spectra very well for all the sample objects . in this way",
    ", the best fitted continuum model is obtained .",
    "we then include the 57kev energy range before we unfold ( see below ) the x - ray spectra .",
    "2 .   unfolding the spectrum : the intrinsic source spectra ( before entering the x - ray telescope ) can be reconstructed with the instrumental effects eliminated by unfolding the observed spectra with the calculated conversion factors from the best - fit models .",
    "we apply the best - fit continuum model to the ungrouped spectra .",
    "the unfolded spectra are then calculated by using the eufspec command in xspec .",
    "3 .   rescaling : the unfolded spectra are corrected for the absorption effects ( both galactic and intrinsic ) and de - redshifted to the source rest frame .",
    "we rescale the normalization of the unfolded spectra in such a way that each spectrum has nearly the same weight as the others ; following @xcite , we rescale the spectra in such a way that they have the same 25kev fluxes in the rest frame . 4 .",
    "rebin : the de - redshifted and rescaled rest - frame spectra have different energy bins ( as they are set by the energy channels of the detectors ) , and thus have to be rebined into unified bins before stacking . to construct a new , unified bin scale",
    ", we shift the observed spectra ( the original folded and unrescaled spectra , measured in counts per channel ) to the source rest frame , rebin the spectra to a common energy grid comprised of narrow bins ( bin width @xmath650ev ) .",
    "we add all the rebinned spectra together in counts per bin .",
    "the co - added spectrum is grouped in such a way that each new bin contains at least 900 counts .",
    "this sets the final bin scale for the stacking .",
    "finally , we rebin the unfolded and rescaled spectra according to this new energy bin system ; in this way , all the unfolded and rescaled spectra have the same energy bins .",
    "stacking : the stacked spectrum is obtained by averaging the rebinned and rescaled spectra using the simple arithmetic mean .",
    "the errors are calculated using the propagation of errors , as in @xcite .",
    "the stacked 210kev spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : aver_fit ] .",
    "fitting the continuum spectrum with the 58kev range excluded gives a photon index @xmath31 .",
    "it shows clearly a prominent broad emission feature in the 57kev energy range superposing the power - law continuum , which must be due to the fe @xmath0 emission . in below",
    "we test the reliability of the presence of this feature , by means of monte carlo simulations .    in their original work ,",
    "@xcite performed extensive simulations to investigate the effects of the stacking method on the detection of potential line features in the stacked spectrum , and concluded that the method is reliable and does not produce spurious line features nor change the profile of real lines . here",
    "we carry out independent checks to test whether the broad emission feature is an artifact produced by the stacking procedure , using simulations similar to those in @xcite .",
    "this is done by applying the stacking method to a set of simulated ` observed ' power - law spectra without any lines .",
    "using the best - fit continuum spectrum model ( power - law plus absorption ) , we simulate the ` observed ' source and background spectra for each of our objects using xspec ; the exposure time , auxiliary and the response matrix files for the sources are used in the simulations to match exactly the observations .",
    "we then apply the same stacking method to those simulated spectra and obtain a composite simulated spectrum , which is shown in figure [ fig : aver_con_sig ] ( left - hand panel ; open circles ) , along with the composite source spectrum for a comparison .",
    "as expected , no emission feature is present in the stacked simulated continuum .",
    "thus the broad emission feature in composite source spectrum is not an artifact caused by the stacking method .",
    "a power - law gives a good fit to the composite simulated continuum with @xmath32 , well consistent with the model fitted to the underlying continuum of the stacked source spectrum above .",
    "following @xcite , we use this composite simulated continuum as the underlying continuum of the composite source spectrum .    to construct the confidence intervals for the underlying continuum of the composite source spectrum ,",
    "we simulate 100 power - law plus absorption continuum spectra for each individual source and produce 100 stacked continuum spectra . by removing the far - most , two - sided 32 and 5 extreme values in each energy bin , we can estimate the 68 per cent ( 1@xmath12 ) and 95 per cent ( 2@xmath12 ) confidence intervals for the underlying continuum of the stacked spectrum , which are over - plotted in figure [ fig : aver_con_sig ] ( left panel ) . for a given energy bin ,",
    "the probability that the data point of a simulated stacked spectrum falls out of the 2@xmath12 interval is @xmath33 .",
    "the joint probability that @xmath34 adjacent data bins are all in excess of the 2@xmath12 confidence region is @xmath35 .",
    "it can be seen that at least 10 adjacent data points of the composite source spectrum in the fe @xmath0 region fall at or out of the 2@xmath12 confidence levels .",
    "therefore , the probability that the observed broad emission feature in the composite source spectrum arises from statistical fluctuations is @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , we investigate whether the profile of a line can be significantly affected by the stacking method .",
    "we simulate a series of observed spectra , with the intrinsic spectra comprising a power law continuum and a gaussian line , using the response matrices and exposures in our sample .",
    "the line energy and the line width @xmath12 are fixed at reasonable values ( e.g. , @xmath37kev , @xmath38ev or less ) , and the other parameters are randomly chosen ( e.g. , @xmath39 in the 2.02.2 range and the @xmath7 in a wide range ) .",
    "we then apply the stacking method to the simulated spectra .",
    "we find that the method has almost no affect on the line profile if the line is significantly broader than the instrumental energy resolution , as in our case here .",
    "however , as expected , narrow lines remain unresolved in the unfolded spectra with a width comparable to the intrinsic instrumental energy resolution , which is energy dependent @xcite .",
    "we examine the resulting profile in the unfolded spectra of an intrinsically unresolved gaussian line ( assuming @xmath40ev ) by simulations .",
    "we consider the line energy in the fek@xmath30 line region 6.46.97kev ( fei  fexxvi ) and a redshift of 0.085 ( the median redshift of our sample ) .",
    "we find that an intrinsically unresolved line manifests itself as a gaussian in the unfolded spectrum , which has a standard deviation around @xmath41ev ( 70110ev ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the conclusion reached by @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that the broad emission feature in 5 - 7kev in the composite source spectrum should be real , rather than being an artifact produced by the stacking method nor due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "it should be noted that this stacking method is based on essentially averaging of the fluxes of the sources rather than photon counts , and the way of weighting is such that all the spectra have nearly the same weight by rescaling ( see above ) . as a result , the composite spectrum will not be dominated by strong sources and the other with net counts @xmath42 .",
    "we find that the overall profiles of the stacked spectra of the two sub - samples are well consistent with each other . ] .",
    "the right - hand panel in figure [ fig : aver_con_sig ] shows the ratio of the stacked source spectrum to the stacked simulated power - law continuum .",
    "it can be seen that its profile resembles closely a relativistic broad fe @xmath0 line . in section [ sec : sec4 ] we study the profile of this complex feature by modelling it with relativistically broadened line models as well as other models .",
    "we use xspec ( version 12.8 ) to fit the stacked spectrum .",
    "the ftools task flx2xsp is used to convert the flux spectrum into fits format which can be fitted using xspec .",
    "since we are interested in the broad emission feature , we use only the 38kev band in the spectral fitting below .",
    "this avoids the somewhat large uncertainty in the higher energy band and the highly model - dependent unfolded spectrum ( e.g. , absorption , soft x - ray excess emission ) below 3kev @xcite .",
    "a simple power - law model leads to an unacceptable fit ( @xmath43 ) , as expected , and other components have to be added . in the following fittings ,",
    "we adopt the power - law fitted from the stacked simulated spectrum as the continuum model , with the slope and normalization parameters fixed at the best - fit values obtained above .",
    "in addition , a gaussian componentin the actual fitting the width of the gaussian line is fixed at @xmath44ev to account for the unresolvability of narrow lines in the unfolded spectra due to the intrinsic instrumental energy resolution ( see section[sec : subsec3.2 ] ; using other values of 70110ev has almost no affect on the results ) . the same practice is exercised for adding other unresolved narrow lines in the modelling in the rest of the paper . ] with the line energy fixed at 6.4kev is also included to account for the unresolved narrow fe @xmath0 line which is ubiquitously found in agn .",
    "we consider this model of the power - law plus the narrow gaussian line as a baseline model .",
    "this baseline model only results a poor fit ( @xmath45 ) , with an @xmath46ev of the narrow line . adding another gaussian component with all the parameters free can improve the fit significantly ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this broad gaussian component , with the line energy peaked at @xmath66.2kev and line width @xmath60.8kev , may indicate a broad line feature in the @xmath657kev energy range .",
    "below we try to fit this broad profile using various models .",

    "a narrow emission or absorption line is also suggested in the composite spectrum at energy around 6.77.0kev , though the statistical significance is not very high .",
    "we tend to identify it as arising from highly ionized fe ions , i.e. , fexxvi in case a or fexxv in case b. high - ionization emission / absorption lines , of both low and high velocities , are often detected in the x - ray spectra of agn @xcite , and also in sources showing a relativistic broad fe @xmath0 line ( * ? ? ?",

    ", the absorption line is probably correspond to the fexxv resonant absorption line , likely produced in a compton - thin photoionized material .",
    "the ionization parameter should be low ( e.g. , @xmath158 , @xcite ) since no h - like iron absorption is detected in the stacked spectrum .",
    "the line @xmath7 is @xmath159ev , consistent well with @xcite , can be produced by material with column density larger than @xmath160@xmath156 .    in any case",
    ", an ionized compton - thin material seems to be required to account for the potential high ionization emission / absorption feature in the stacked spectrum .",
    "we thus suggest that this kind of material should be ubiquitous in nls1s and probably locates far from the central region , e.g. , the blr or torus .",
    "the black hole spin parameter constrained from the relativistic broad fe k@xmath30 line in the stacked spectrum is @xmath109 in case a or @xmath161 in case b using the relline model at the 90 per cent confidence level ( the statistical significance is somewhat lower if the power - law continuum slope is set as a free parameter ) .",
    "a higher spin value is also unlikely to be the case using the blurred reflection model , though with a lower significance in some cases .",
    "this result indicates that the bulk of the black holes of nls1s in the nearby universe ( a median redshift @xmath162 ) either have averagely low or moderate spins , or distribute in a wide range of spins , from low spins to high ones ; it is ruled out that most nls1s have extremely large spins ( e.g. , @xmath163 ) .",

    "interestingly , we note that the spin of j2127.5 + 5654 is consistent with the ensemble constraints obtained in this study .",
    "nls1s may represent an interesting and important phase in the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "given their relatively small black hole masses and high accretion rates , there are suggestions that nls1s are at an early stage of agn evolution @xcite",
    ". the distribution of the spins of the black holes may give insight into the processes of how their black holes grow and evolve .",
    "theoretical models have shown that different processes of black hole growth lead to distinct distributions of the black holes spins .",
    "if black holes grow by merger only , the spin distribution would be bimodal with one peak at @xmath1660.0 and the other at @xmath1660.7 . for processes of merger plus prolonged accretion ,",
    "the overall spins are high ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "low spins ( @xmath168 ) will result from merger plus chaotic accretion processes @xcite .",
    "there have been suggestions that the evolution of nls1s is driven by secular processes instead of major mergers , and their host galaxies possess mostly pseudo - bulges ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "we first consider the prolonged accretion scenario by assuming an initial non - spinning black hole accreted continuously at the eddington accretion rate with a radiation efficiency @xmath169 . since prolonged accretion can spin up the black hole efficiently",
    ", the black hole will reach the maximum spin after an increase of its mass by a factor of @xmath170 only @xcite .",
    "this takes roughly the salpeter timescale ( @xmath171yr , assuming the radiation efficiency @xmath169 ) for agn radiating at the eddington luminosity .",
    "if the black hole spins turn out to be low or moderate , as is found in our work here , the agn in nls1s should be not only very young , much younger than @xmath172yr , but also with an initial spin close to 0 .",
    "given the relatively short time left for the black holes to grow , the current black hole masses of nls1s would be on the same order of magnitude as the seed black holes , which would then be @xmath173 . since such high - mass seed black holes are not predicted by the current theories of black hole formation , the pure prolonged accretion scenario , in which black holes in nls1s obtained their mass via continuous gas accretion onto initially much smaller seed black holes , seems to be inconsistent with our result .",
    "alternatively , the black holes in nls1s may grow via mainly the process of chaotic accretion .",
    "such a process would lead to low values of the final average spins , e.g. , @xmath174 as found by @xcite , which is in good agreement with what we found here ( @xmath109 in the case where the narrow feature is an emission line ) .",
    "if confirmed , our result suggests that the growth and evolution of the black holes in the bulk of nls1s are likely to proceed via the chaotic accretion process .",
    "one should also note , however , the black hole spin parameter is constrained to be widely distributed ( @xmath161 ) in the case b ( see section [ sec : subsec4 ] ) .",
    "if this is true , then the chaotic accretion can not be the main process to control the spin evolution of black holes in nls1s provided that these black holes grow up from very small seeds .",
    "it is possible that the growth of each of these black holes is due to chaotic accretion with many episodes , in each episode the accretion is prolonged with a significant increase of black hole mass and significant spin evolution . in order to be compatible with a wide distribution of spin parameters among nls1s , the black hole mass increase in each episode",
    "should be less than a factor of few .    to close this section",
    ", we note that the standard thin disk model is adopted in our study to fit the fe k@xmath30 line profile for nls1s as common practice , however , which may be not valid for some nls1s .",
    "observations have suggested that some nls1s may radiate at luminosities @xmath175per cent of the eddington luminosity , for which a slim disk model may be needed to describe the accretion @xcite . in the slim disk model , the disk is puffed up at the region close to the central black hole , the radiation from this region may be still efficient or may be not , and some radiation may be even emitted from the region within the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "therefore , the fe k@xmath30 emission resulting from a slim disk model , if any , may be broader or less broad comparing with that expected from a thin disk model . in this case",
    ", it is not easy to directly relate the width and shape of the fe k@xmath30 line emission with the black hole spin due to the complications of the slim disk model .",
    "in this paper , we study the ensemble property of the fe @xmath0 line in nls1s by stacking the _ xmm - newton _ spectra of a sample of 51 nls1s observed in a total of 68 observations . by virtue of its highly improved s /",
    "n , the stacked spectrum reveals a prominent , broad emission feature , which can be well - fitted with relativistically broad line models , although a partial covering absorption model can not be ruled out .",
    "our result suggests that , as in seyfert 1 galaxies , the relativistic fe @xmath0 line may in fact be common in nls1s , which would be detected in the x - ray spectra of nls1s with high s / n .",
    "the narrow 6.4kev fe @xmath0 line is found to be much weaker than the expected value from the known iwasawa - taniguchi relation , which may indicate a smaller covering factor of the reflection material in nls1s .",
    "the stacked spectrum also shows a possible high - ionization iron emission or absorption line , produced by ionised material far away from the central region .",
    "we also try to constrain the average spin of the black holes in nls1s by modeling the stacked spectrum with relativistic line models .",
    "our results tentatively suggest that the average spins are likely low or intermediate , and generally very fast spins ( @xmath176 ) seem to be inconsistent with the data .",
