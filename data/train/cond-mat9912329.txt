    "among the phenomena presently investigated in cell biology is the generation of directed movement of `` particles '' ( e.g. kinesin or myosin molecules ) along periodic structures ( e.g. microtubules or actin filaments ) @xcite in the _ absense of a macroscopic force _ , which may have resulted from temperature or concentration gradients . in order to reveal the microscopic mechanisms resulting in directed movement ,",
    "different physical ratchet models have been proposed @xcite , such as _ forced thermal ratchets _",
    "@xcite , or _",
    "stochastic ratchets _",
    "@xcite , or _",
    "fluctuating ratchets _ @xcite .",
    "these models are based on different types of long - range order correlations , e.g. a periodic asymmetric potential , or a time - dependent change of noise , or a fluctuating energy barrier ( cf . also sect . [ 4 ] ) .",
    "they have in common to transfer the undirected motion of brownian particles into a directed motion , hence , the term _ brownian rectifiers _",

    "the model discussed in this paper , aims to add a new perspective to this problem .",
    "our model is based on _ active brownian particles _",
    "@xcite , which are brownian particles with the ability to take up energy from the environment , to store it in an internal depot and to convert internal energy to perform different activities , such as metabolism , motion , change of the environment , or signal - response behavior . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the energetic aspects of the motion of these active brownian particles in a specific potential and neglect the possible changes of the environment .",
    "different from `` usual '' brownian particles which only move _ passively _ caused by the influence of a stochastic force , active brownian particles have the capability of _ active motion_. this means for instance the possibility of accelerated motion , provided there is a supercritical supply of energy from the environment .",
    "in general , we can think of different mechanisms to pump additional energy into the motion of the particles .",
    "for example , a complex friction coefficient , @xmath3 , can be considered , which is a space- and /or velocity dependent function , which can be also negative under certain conditions .",
    "space - dependent negative friction has been discussed in @xcite , while different ansatzes for a complex velocity - dependent friction coefficient are investigated in @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that above a critical influx of energy the brownian particles are able to perform a selfsustained limit cycle motion .    in our model , the brownian particles",
    "are not just pumped by additional energy , but also have the capability to store energy in an internal depot .",
    "this means an additional degree of freedom for the particle , which may allow a simplified description of active biological motion on the micro - level @xcite .",
    "considering for instance a spatially inhomogeneous supply of energy , or the presence of obstacles , we have shown that the motion of active brownian particles in the two - dimensional space can become rather complex @xcite .",
    "we have found e.g. intermittent types of motion where cycles of accelerated motion alternate with cycles of `` simple '' brownian motion , or deterministic chaos in the presence of reflecting obstacles .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the motion of an ensemble of brownian particles with internal energy depot in a ratchet potential , i.e. a periodic potential which lacks the reflection symmetry . in sect . [ 2 ] , we discuss the basic features of our model and derive the equations of motion and the stationary solutions for the case of a linear potential . in sect .",
    "[ 3 ] , we specify the external potential as a non - fluctuating ratchet potential . by means of computer simulations , we investigate the attractor structure of the particles motion and show the existence of bound and unbound attractors dependent on the energy supply .",
    "further , we compare the deterministic motion of the particle ensemble with the stochastic motion .",
    "we show that in the deterministic case a positive net current occurs , which changes its direction in the presence of stochastic influences . in order to investigate the current reversal in more detail , in sect . [ 4 ] the dependence of the net current on the energy supply and the asymmetry of the potential is calculated both for the deterministic and the stochastic case . in sect .",
    "[ 5 ] , we compare our model with different ratchet models suggested previously , and point to some differences .",
    "the model of active brownian motion investigated in this paper is based on the idea @xcite that the particles have the capability to store energy in an internal energy depot , @xmath4 , which may be changed due to three different processes :    1 .",
    "gain of energy from the environment , where @xmath5 is the flux of energy into the depot .",
    "if the availability of energy is inhomogeneously distributed , the energy flux may depend on the space coordinate , @xmath6 .",
    "loss of energy due to internal dissipation , which is assumed to be proportional to the internal energy .",
    "here the rate of energy loss , @xmath7 , is assumed to be constant .",
    "3 .   conversion of internal energy into kinetic energy with a rate @xmath8 , which should be a function of the actual velocity , @xmath9 , of the particle .",
    "the resulting balance equation for the energy depot is given by : @xmath10 a simple ansatz for @xmath8 reads : @xmath11 if we consider the motion of a particle with mass @xmath12 in an _ external potential _ , @xmath13 , the balance equation for the mechanical energy @xmath14 of the particle reads : @xmath15 it means that @xmath16 can be changed by two processes :    1 .",

    "we assume a linear function , hence the resulting force is a constant : @xmath34 then , the dynamics for the pumped brownian motion is described by the following set of equations : @xmath35 here , we have introduced a formal parameter @xmath36 which can be used to describe the time scale of relaxation of the internal energy depot .",
    "the limit describes a very fast adaptation of the depot . assuming further an ideal efficiency , @xmath37 , we get as an adiabatic approximation for the energy depot : @xmath38 this allows us to rewrite the equations of motion as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a non - linear friction function : @xmath41 in the limit of large velocities",

    "hence , slow particles are accelerated , while the motion of fast particles is damped . a more detailed discussion of @xmath40 is given in @xcite .",
    "a similar discussion holds if we assume that the value of the energy depot @xmath42 is constant and the conversion efficiency @xmath43 decreases as follows with increasing velocity : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are constants .",

    "motion into both positive and negative direction .    to conclude these investigations",
    ", we find that the structure of the phase space of a active brownian particle in an unsymmetrical ratchet potential may be rather complex . while at low pumping rates bound attractors ( limit cycles ) in each potential",
    "well are observed , with increasing pumping rates one / two new unbound attractors are formed , which correspond to a directed stationary transport of the particles into negative / positive direction .    considering the threedimensional phase space , @xmath82 , these two stationary solutions are separated by a two - dimensional separatrix plane .",
    "this plane has to be periodic in space because of the periodicity of the ratchet potential . in order to get an idea of the shape of the separatrix we have performed computer simulations which determined the direction of motion of one particle for various initial conditions .",

    "we can conclude that , if a particle moves into the positive direction , most of the time the trajectory is very close to the separatrix .",
    "that means it will be rather susceptible for small perturbations , i.e. even small fluctuations might be able to destabilize the motion into the positive direction .",
    "the motion into negative direction , on the other hand , is not susceptible in the same manner , since the respective trajectory remains in a considerable distance from the separatrix or comes close to the separatrix only for a very short time .",
    "this conclusion will be of importance when discussing the current reversal in a ratchet potential in sect .",

    "( [ ux ] ) , is investigated both for the deterministic and the stochastic case . for the computer simulations , we have assumed that the start locations of the particles are equally distributed over the first period of the potential , @xmath84 .",
    "we note , that in the computer simulations always the complete set of equations ( [ model ] ) for the particles is solved .    in the _ deterministic case _ , the direction of motion and the velocity at any time",
    "@xmath27 are mainly determined by the initial conditions . provided a sufficient supply of energy , particles with an initial position between @xmath85 , which initially feel a force into the negative direction , most likely move with a negative velocity , whereas particles with an initial position between @xmath86 most likely move into the positive direction . for parameter values which allow the existence of two unbound attractors ( cf . also fig .",

    "[ damp - ve - x0 ] shows the final distribution of the velocities in the deterministic case .",
    "we see two main currents of particles occuring , with a positive and a negative velocity . the net current , however , has a positive direction , since most of the particles start with the matching initial condition .",

    "[ damp - ve - x0 ] , the related velocity distribution in the stochastic case now approaches an one peak distribution , shown in fig .",
    "[ damp - noi - ve - vert ] .",
    "hence , stochastic effects are able to stabilize the motion in the vicinity of the unbound attractor which corresponds to the negative current , while they destabilize the motion in the vicinity of the unbound attractor corresponding to the positive current , both shown in fig .",
    "[ phase - traj]c .",
    "a similar situation can be also observed when the motion of the particles is less damped ( cf .",
    "[ und - ensem - xve - t ] ) . for this case",
    ", we clearly see both the mean velocity and the mean energy depot approaching constant values , instead of oscillating .",
    "further , the time scale of the relaxation into the stationary values decreases with the intensity of the stochastic force .",
    "the related velocity distribution of the particles is plotted for different intensities of the stochastic force in fig .",
    "[ und - ve - vert ] . for @xmath80",
    ", there are two sharp peaks at positive values for the speed and one peak for negative values , hence , the average current is positive .",
    "the three maxima correspond to the stationary velocities in the deterministic case . for @xmath93 ,",
    "the distribution of positive velocities is declining , since most of the particles already move with a negative velocity , and for @xmath94 after the same time all particles have a negative velocity .",
    "further , the velocity distribution becomes more broaden in the presence of noise .    as a result of the computer simulations presented in this section",
    ", we find that an ensemble of pumped brownian particles moving in a ratchet potential is able to produce a directed net current . in the deterministic case",
    ", we find two currents into opposite directions related to a sharply peaked bimodal velocity distribution , and the direction of the resulting net current is determined by the initial conditions of the majority of the particles .",
    "in the stochastic case , however , we find only a broad and symmetric unimodal velocity distribution , resulting in a stronger net current .",
    "the direction of this net current is opposite to the deterministic case and points into the negative direction , hence , stochastic forces are able to change the direction of motion of the particles moving into the positive @xmath31-direction . this reversal will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "the previous computer simulations revealed the dependence of the net current on the initial conditions and on the influence of the stochastic force .",
    "since all particles have started in the first period of the ratchet potential , the existence of periodic stationary solutions , @xmath95 , requires that the particles are able to escape from the potential well .",
    "hence , they must be able to move `` uphill '' on one or both flanks of the ratchet potential , in order to obtain a net current . in the phase space , this corresponds to the formation of unbound attractors corresponding to directed motion in the ratchet potential .",
    "this , in turn , would require a supercritical supply of energy for the pumped brownian particles to move in the active or `` high velocity '' mode , as already mentioned in sect . [ 2 ] .",
    "( [ d2-f ] ) provides a necessary condition for a stable uphill motion on a single flank in terms of a critical conversion rate @xmath96 . in order to demonstrate the applicability of eq .",

    ", there is no net current at all .",
    "this is due to the subcritical supply of energy from the internal depot , which does not allow an uphill motion on any flank of the potential .",
    "consequently , after the initial downhill motion , the particles perform a localized motion ( oscillation ) within the potential well ( cf . also fig .",
    "[ phase - traj]a ) and no current occurs .",
    "the amplitude of these oszillations depends on the conversion rate @xmath100 . in the limit of vanishing energy conversion",
    "the motion of the particles comes to rest in the minima of the ratchet potential .    with an increasing value of @xmath50",
    ", we see the occurence of a negative net current at @xmath98 .",
    "that means , the energy depot provides enough energy for the uphill motion along the flank with the lower slope , which , in our example , is the one with @xmath101 ( cf .",
    "[ potent ] ) .",
    "if we insert this value for @xmath57 into the critical condition , eq .",
    "( [ d2-f ] ) , a value @xmath102 is obtained , which agrees with the onset of the negative current in the deterministic computer simulations , fig .",
    "[ v - d2-stoch ] .    for @xmath103 , a stable motion of the particles up and down the flank with the lower slope is possible , but the same does not necessarily apply for the steeper slope .",

    "consequently , they turn their direction on the steeper slope , then move downhill driven by the force into the negative direction , and continue to move into the negative direction while climbing up the lower slope . therefore ,",
    "for values of the conversion rate between @xmath98 and @xmath99 , we only have an _ unimodal _ distribution of the velocity , and only one unbound attractor exists as shown in fig .",
    "[ phase - traj]b .    for @xmath104 ,",
    "the energy depot also supplies enough energy for the particles to climb up the steeper slope , consequently a periodic motion of the particles into the positive direction becomes possible , now . in our example",

    "[ und - ve - vert ] .",
    "this corresponds to the existence of two unbound attractors as shown in fig .",
    "[ phase - traj]c . for equally distributed initial positions of the particles ,",
    "the net current which results from the average of the two main currents has a positive direction in the deterministic case , because most of the particles start into a positive direction , as discussed above .",
    "let us now turn to the _ stochastic case_. in sect .",
    "[ 3 ] , we have already shown that the influence of a stochastic force may lead to a _",
    "current reversal_. in the deterministic case , the particles will keep their direction determined by the initial conditions provided the energy supply allows them to move `` uphill '' , which is the case for @xmath104 . in the stochastic case , however , the initial conditions will be `` forgotten '' after a short time , hence due to stochastic influences , the particle s `` upill '' motion along the steeper flank will soon turn into a `` downhill '' motion .",
    "this motion into the negative direction will be most likely kept because less energy is needed .",
    "thus , the stochastic fluctuations reveal the instability of an `` uphill '' motion along the steeper slope .    for a comparison with the determinsitic case , fig .",
    "[ v - d2-stoch ] shows the average velocity also for the stochastic case . here , the net current is always negative in agreement with the explanation above",
    "this holds even if the supercritical supply of energy , expressed by the conversion parameter , @xmath104 , would allow a _",
    "motion into the positive direction ( cf . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ v - d2-stoch ] ) .",
    "in addition , we find a _ very small _ positive net current in the range of small @xmath50 ( cf . the insert in fig .",
    "[ v - d2-stoch ] ) .",
    "whereas in the deterministic case , for the same values of @xmath50 no net current at all is obtained , the fluctuations in the stochastic case allow some particles to escape the potential barriers .    in order to investigate",

    "[ v - a - stoch ] shows the average velocity , @xmath97 , dependent on the asymmetry parameter , @xmath77 .",
    "the simulations have been carried out for different values of the stochastic force in the _ overdamped case _",
    ", for a fixed value @xmath121 .",
    "in particular , the top part of fig .",
    "[ v - a - stoch ] also includes the curve for @xmath80 . as we see in the deterministic case , for @xmath122 the flank @xmath117",
    "is too steep for the particles , therefore only a negative current can occur . for @xmath123 , however , the particles are able to move uphill either flank",
    ". hence , also a positive net current can establish .    as long as the stochastic forces are below a critical value , @xmath112 , which is about @xmath124 , the curves for the stochastic case are not very different from the deterministic one , as shown in the top part of fig .",
    "[ v - a - stoch ] .",
    "hence , the above conclusions about the current reversal in the deterministic case apply . however , for @xmath125 ( cf . the bottom part of fig .",
    "[ v - a - stoch ] ) we do not find a critical asymmetry @xmath126 for a current reversal .",
    "instead , the net current keeps its positive ( for @xmath127 ) or negative ( for @xmath128 ) direction for any value of @xmath127 or @xmath128 , respectively .    the bottom part of fig .",
    "[ v - a - stoch ] further indicates the existence of an optimal strength of the stochastic force , again .",
    "similar to the investigations in fig .",
    "[ v - s ] , we find that an increase in @xmath21 does not necessarily results in a increase of the amount of the net current .",
    "in fact , the maximum value of @xmath114 is smaller for @xmath110 than for @xmath129 , which indicates an optimal strength of the stochastic force , @xmath113 , between @xmath130 and @xmath131 for the considered set of parameters .",
    "we note that the values for both the critical strength , @xmath132 , and the optimal strength , @xmath113 , of the stochastic force depend on the value of the conversion parameter , @xmath50 , as a comparison of fig .",
    "[ v - s ] and fig .",
    "[ v - a - stoch ] shows .",
    "further , these values may be also functions of the other parameters , such as @xmath133 , @xmath18 , and therefore differ for the strongly overdamped and the less damped case .",
    "in sects . [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] , we have shown by means of computer simulations , that an ensemble of pumped brownian particles moving in a ratchet potential can produce a _ directed net current_. hence , by means of an appropriate _ asymmetric potential _ and an additional mechanism to drive the system into _ non - equilibrium _ , we are able to convert the genuinely _ non - directed _ brownian motion into _ directed motion_. in this respect , our result agrees with the conclusions of other physical ratchet models which have been proposed to reveal the microscopic mechanisms resulting in directed movement . in order to point ot some differences to our model",
    ", we first need to summarize the basic principles .",
    "ratchet models which describe the directed transport of particles , are usually based on _ three ingredients _ : ( i ) an _ asymmetric periodic potential _ , known as ratchet potential , eq .",
    "( [ ux ] ) , fig",
    ". [ potent ] , which lacks the reflection symmetry , ( ii ) _ stochastic forces _",
    "@xmath134 , i.e. the influence of noise resulting from thermal fluctuations on the microscale , and ( iii ) _ additional correlations _ , which push the system _ out of thermodynamic equilibrium_. for the latter one , different assumptions can be made . in the example of the _ flashing ratchet _ , the correlations result from an fluctuating energy profile . in the overdamped limit ,",
    "the dynamics of a brownian particle can then be described by the equation of motion : @xmath135 the _ nonequilibrium forcing _ @xmath136 which governs the time dependent change of the potential , can be either considered as a periodic , deterministic modulation with period @xmath137 , @xmath138 , or as a stochastic _ non - white _ process @xmath136 . in the special case where @xmath136 or @xmath139 have only the values @xmath140 ,",
    "the periodic potential is switched @xmath141 and @xmath142 .    in another class of ratchet models , the additional correlations result from _ spatially uniform forces _ of temporal or statistical _",
    "zero average_. in the example of the _ rocking ratchet _ , the particles are subject to a spatially uniform time - periodic deterministic force @xmath143 , for instance : @xmath144 here , the potential @xmath145 is periodically rocked .",
    "if the value of @xmath146 is adjusted properly , in the deterministic case a net current of particles into the direction of the _ lower slope _ can be observed , while the movement into the direction of the steeper slope is still blocked .",
    "however , a consideration of stochastic influences results in a _ current reversal _ for a certain range of the parameters @xmath146 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "then , the net current occurs again in the direction of the _ steeper slope_. because this phenomenon depends also on the mass of the particles , it can be used for mass separation @xcite .",
    "another example of the same class , the _ correlation ratchet _",
    "@xcite , is also driven by a spatially uniform , but stochastic force , @xmath136 . here",
    ", the equation for the overdamped motion reads for instance : @xmath147 where @xmath136 is a time correlated ( colored ) noise of zero average . as a third example , the _ diffusion ratchet _",
    "@xcite is driven by a spatially uniform , time - periodic diffusion coefficient , which may result e.g. from an oscillating temperature . in the overdamped limit ,",
    "the equation of motion reads for example : @xmath148\\ ; \\sqrt{2 d}\\;\\xi(t)\\ ] ] inspite of the different ways to introduce additional correlations , all these models have in common to transfer the undirected motion of brownian particles into directed motion , hence , the term _ brownian rectifiers _",
    "@xcite has been established .    as we have shown in this paper ,",
    "our own model can also serve for this purpose . for a comparison with the models above",
    ", we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ x - overd ] ) for the overdamped motion of the brownian particles with internal energy depot in a more general way : @xmath149 in eq .",
    "( [ x - sumar ] ) , the prefactor @xmath150 appears _ twice _",
    ", up to a constant @xmath151 : it changes _ both _ the influence of the ratchet potential , and the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient . in _ this",
    "_ respect , our model is between a flashing ratchet model , eq .",
    "( [ flash ] ) , and a diffusion ratchet model , eq .",
    "( [ diffus ] ) .",
    "@xmath150 is _ in general _ a time dependent function , because of @xmath4 . in the limit of a stationary approximation , @xmath152 , eq . ( [ e0 ] ) , we found @xcite that @xmath150 may switch between two constant values @xmath153",
    ", @xmath154 : @xmath155 dependent on the moving direction and the flank , the particle is moving on . hence , the function @xmath150 does not represent a spatially uniform force .",
    "however , it has been shown in @xcite , that for the stationary approximation @xmath156 holds , i.e. the force is of zero average with respect to one period , @xmath137 .",
    "hence , we conclude that the mechanism of motion which eq .",
    "( [ x - overd ] ) is based on , should be different from the previous mechanisms which originate directed motion in a ratchet potential .    finally , we note that the model of active brownian particles with internal energy depot is not restricted to ratchet systems . in a general sense",
    ", these particles can be described as brownian machines or _",
    "molecular motors _ which convert chemical energy into mechanical motion .",
    "while different ideas for brownian machines have been suggested @xcite , our model aims to add a new perspective to this problem .",
    "the ability of the particles to take up energy from the environment , to store it in an internal depot and to convert internal energy to perform different activities , may open the door to a more refined description of microbiological processes based on physical principles .",
