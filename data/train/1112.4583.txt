    "blazar is a class of active galactic nuclei , whose relativistic jets are considered to be directed along the line of sight ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "radiation of blazars has three main properties .",
    "first , the blazars emit electromagnetic radiation in a broad range from the radio to gamma - ray bands .",
    "their emission consists of two major components ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the low energy component is synchrotron radiation observed from the radio to the optical , sometimes extending to the x - ray bands .",
    "the high energy component is inverse - compton scattering from the x - ray to the gamma - ray bands .",
    "second , blazars exhibit rapid and violent variability in all wavelength bands @xcite .",
    "the variability has various timescales from less than a day ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) to longer than years ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "third , blazars possess relativistic jets ( e.g. @xcite ) , which are responsible for high polarization observed at optical / near - infrared ( nir ) , and radio wavelengths .",
    "since the polarization can be a probe of the magnetic field in the jet , polarimetric observations are important to study the structure of the jet .",
    "the temporal variation of the polarization vector is complex in general .",
    "@xcite reported that the polarization behavior was erratic in blazars . on the other hand",
    ", several papers reported that the polarization vector exhibited systematic variations , for example , positive correlations between the flux and the degree of polarization ( pd ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have reported that the polarization vector in bl  lac smoothly rotated when the object was bright . from this result",
    ", they proposed that this rotation indicated an emission zone passing through a helical magnetic field in the jet .",
    "@xcite reported a rotation of polarization in 3c  279 , and proposed that the rotation event is attributed to a bent jet .",
    "however , there are only a few rotation events which have been reported to date .",
    "3c  454.3 is one of the most famous blazars .",
    "the object is classified as flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , and its redshift is @xmath0 @xcite . although the object had been quiet in the optical band until 2001 , the object has kept showing the active behavior since then @xcite . in 2005 ,",
    "the object showed an exceptional outburst . in this outburst ,",
    "the object brightened from the radio to the gamma - ray bands ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . after this outburst ,",
    "similar outbursts were detected in 2007 and 2008 . in 2005 and 2007 outbursts ,",
    "rotation events of the optical polarization vector were reported by @xcite and @xcite . in dec .",
    "2009 , a prominent outburst was reported for this object in the gamma - ray band by _ fermi_/lat and agile ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , in the x - ray band by _",

    "the object showed flux variability over timescales less than three hours and very mild spectral variability with an indication of gradual hardening preceding major flares .",
    "the minimum doppler factor was 13 , estimated by using these results .",
    "@xcite also estimated the doppler factors @xmath1  25 during the outburst by constructing a multi - wavelength spectral model .",
    "we performed monitor observations of 3c  454.3 from may 2009 to february 2010 in a multi - color photometric and polarimetric mode using the kanata telescope .",
    "we also observed in the radio and infrared ( ir ) bands . in this paper",
    ", we report on the behavior of the 2009 outburst in these bands , and the detections of two rotation events in the polarization vector .",
    "directions of these two rotations were different , suggesting a complex magnetic field in the jet .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows : in section  2 , we present the observation method and analysis in the radio , infrared , optical and x - ray bands . in section  3 , first we report the light curves and the spectral indexes of the x - ray and optical bands .",
    "then , we report the temporal behavior of polarization in the optical and nir bands . after that , we report the spectral energy distribution from the radio to optical band . in section  4 , we discuss two rotation events which we detected , by comparing them with the past rotation events observed in 2005 , 2007 and 2008 .",
    "the conclusion is drawn in section  5 .",
    "we performed monitor observations of 3c  454.3 using trispec attached to the cassegrain focus of the kanata 1.5-m telescope at higashi - hiroshima observatory .",
    "trispec can perform photometric and polarimetric observations in the optical and two nir bands , simultaneously @xcite . in the observation of 3c  454.3 , unfortunately , one of the two nir arrays was not available due to a readout error . therefore , we observed the object with the multi - color photometric and polarimetric monitoring in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands . a unit of the observing sequence consisted of successive exposures at four position angles of a half - wave plate ; 0 , 45 , 22.5 , 67.5 .",
    "a set of polarization parameters was derived from each set of the four exposures .",

    "typical integration times were 90 and 85  s in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands , respectively .",
    "all images were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded , before aperture photometry .",

    "the decline rates were 14@xmath212 and 49@xmath213  d in the x - ray and optical bands .",

    "the same color behavior was reported in past observations of 3c  454.3 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "these rotations can be confirmed also in the @xmath3-band observations , while the timings of the pa correction are different in several points as shown in panel `` h '' .",

    "this is the same order of magnitude as the values reported in previous studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the optical and nir data are smoothly connected , which suggests that at least the emission from the nir to optical energy band can be explained by a synchrotron component .",
    "our monitoring observations suggest that two rotation events of polarization occurred during the active and outburst states of 3c  454.3 in 2009 .",
    "the features of the rotation `` a '' and `` b '' were summarized in table  1 .",
    "the rotation rates , directions and periods of the rotations are different between the rotation `` a '' and `` b '' .",
    "two models have recently been proposed for the rotation of polarization ; @xcite and @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite , a rotation of the polarization vector is a sign of helical magnetic field in the jet .",
    "the directions of the rotation events in 3c  454.3 are both clockwise and counterclockwise . in the case of the simple helical magnetic field in the jet",
    ", the direction of the rotation of polarization should be one - side .",
    "thus , it needs more complex magnetic field structure in order to explain the rotation events in 3c  454.3 .",
    "@xcite reported a rotation event in 3c  279 , and suggested a non - axisymmetric structure of the jet , implying a curved trajectory for the emitting material .",
    "this idea can explain rotations in both directions , and hence , the rotations in 3c  454.3 .",
    "we can estimate the distance , @xmath44 , traveled by the emitting material during the well - sampled rotation `` b '' in 2009 .",
    "we calculate the travel distance @xmath44 as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath47 is the speed of light and @xmath48 is the duration of the rotation event @xcite .",
    "the duration of the rotation `` b '' was 35  d. in this case , we adopt a values of @xmath49 which was reported by @xcite with the data on jd  2455167.5 ( 2 dec .",
    "thus , we calculate @xmath50  cm .",
    "the travel distance of our result was the same order of magnitude compared with that for 3c  279 reported in @xcite . on the other hand , the duration of the rotation `` a '' was shorter than that of the rotation `` b '' .",
    "thus , the travel distance of the rotation `` a '' could be shorter than that of `` b '' if @xmath46 in the active state is same or smaller than that in the outburst state .",
    "@xcite reported that there was a positive correlation between the amplitudes of the flux and pd of flares in 41 blazars .",
    "the large - amplitude variations in the flux and pd were shown in the outburst state .",
    "thus , there was a positive correlation between the amplitudes of the flux and pd in the outburst state of 3c  454.3 , which was consistent with the positive correlation in blazar flares found by @xcite .",
    "the peak of the pd was delayed by 10  d from the peak of the flux in the outburst .",
    "this behavior might be explained by the following simple geometrical effect scenario .",
    "@xcite suggest that the pd is the highest when the line - of - sight is parallel to the shock plane in the co - moving frame . in this assumption ,",
    "the observed flux from the jet is low because of a low doppler factor .",
    "when the line - of - sight is perpendicular to the shock plane , the observed flux is high because of a high doppler factor , and pd is low because the magnetic field direction is not aligned .",
    "hence , in this scheme , if the shock comes toward us just after its formation then the shock plane gradually inclines with respect to line - of - sight , the pd rises up after the flux peak .",
    "it should be noted that the doppler factor is changed in this scenario .",
    "the doppler factor during the 2009 outburst was estimated with multi - wavelength spectral models , which indicate that the doppler factor @xmath51 was almost constant , @xmath52 during the outburst ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the observed flux , @xmath53 , from the shocked region depends strongly on @xmath51 , as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a spectral index .",
    "during the period of rotation `` b '' ( jd  24551572455192 ) , the maximum and minimum @xmath2-band flux were 6.501 and 1.658 @xmath56 , indicating the flux changed by a factor of 3.9 . however ,",
    "the amplitude of the flux variation should be larger than that , because the @xmath3-band flux variation was larger than that in the @xmath2 band . if we explain all the flux variation only by the variation in @xmath51 , @xmath51 should be changed at least by a factor of 1.4 , assuming the spectral index , @xmath57 .",
    "this is , however , apparently inconsistent with the result from sed modeling that it was constant within @xmath58@xmath59 .",
    "thus , it would be difficult to explain the observation only by the variation in @xmath51 .",
    "more detailed and complex jet modeling would be needed for interpreting the behaviors of the flux and polarization in the outburst state .",

    "three rotation rates are positive values and two rates are negative .",
    "thus , there are not only counterclockwise , but also clockwise directions of the pa rotations .",
    "another feature of the rotation events is that there seems to be two types of events ; fast rotation events ( 2007 , 2008 and 2009 `` a '' ) and slow rotation events ( 2005 and 2009 `` b '' ) .",
    "the fast ones have the absolute rate of the rotation larger than 20  @xmath66 , whereas the slow ones have the value smaller than 10  @xmath66 .",
    "time durations of two types of rotations are different .",
    "the fast ones have short durations , less than 11  d , and the slow rotation `` b '' in 2009 has a long duration , 35  d. it could partly be an observational bias because it is difficult to detect short and slow rotation events .",
    "however , it is worth nothing that there was not any long and fast rotation from 2007 to 2009 .",
    "one possibility is that the fast rotation is the result of an erratic behavior of the polarization vector .",
    "@xcite reported that the polarization vector can be separated into two components : an optical polarization core and chaotic jet emission .",
    "if the chaotic polarization component with a short timescale moves around the origin of the @xmath40 plane , a short fast rotation can occur .",
    "@xcite also discussed that a rotation episode indicated only by a few data points can not be distinguished from results of a random walk in the @xmath40 plane .",
    "we performed the photometric and polarimetric monitoring of 3c  454.3 during 20092010 .",
    "the object showed the active and outburst states in the optical and near - infrared light curves and two rotation events in the temporal variations of polarization . in the past and our polarimetric monitoring ,",
    "five rotation events were reported in 3c  454.3 .",
    "the rotations were observed in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions in the @xmath40 plane . the complex model of the structure of the magnetic field in the jet",
    "is needed to explain these rotation events .",
    "+   + this work was partly supported by a grand - in - aid from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science , and technology of japan ( 22540252 , ) .",
    "this research has made use of data from the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory which has been supported by the university of michigan and by a series of grants from the national science foundation , most recently ast-0607523 .",
    "the submillimeter array is a joint project between the smithsonian astrophysical observatory and the academia sinica institute of astronomy and astrophysics and is funded by the smithsonian institution and the academia sinica .",

    "<S> in december 2009 , the bright blazar , 3c  454.3 exhibited a strong outburst in the optical , x - ray and gamma - ray regions . </S>",
    "<S> we performed photometric and polarimetric monitoring of this outburst in the optical and near - infrared bands with trispec and howpol attached to the kanata telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we also observed this outburst in the infrared band with _ akari _ , and the radio band with the 32-m radio telescope of yamaguchi university . </S>",
    "<S> the object was in an active state from jd  2455055 to 2455159 . </S>",
    "<S> it was 1.3  mag brighter than its quiescent state before jd  2455055 in the optical band . </S>",
    "<S> after the end of the active state in jd  2455159 , a prominent outburst was observed in all wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the outburst continued for two months . </S>",
    "<S> our optical and near - infrared polarimetric observations revealed that the position angle of the polarization ( pa ) apparently rotated clockwise by 240  degrees within 11  d in the active state ( jd  24550632455074 ) , and after this rotation , pa remained almost constant during our monitoring . in the outburst state , </S>",
    "<S> pa smoothly rotated counterclockwise by 350  degrees within 35  d ( jd  24551572455192 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we detected two distinct rotation events of polarization vector in opposite directions . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these two events compared with the past rotation events observed in 2005 , 2007 and 2008 . </S>"
