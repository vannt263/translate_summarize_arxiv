    "turbulence is a strong nonequilibrium phenomenon , exhibiting unpredictable behavior of the velocity field , which can result from the multiple degrees of freedom and nonlinearity of fluid systems @xcite .",
    "this situation complicates our understanding of turbulence , making it one of the unresolved problems in modern physics .",
    "the studies on turbulence in quantum fluids have possibility to shed new light on our understanding of turbulence . in quantum turbulence ( qt ) for quantum fluids such as superfluid helium and one - component atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite , many quantized vortices with quantized circulation are nucleated , forming tangles .",
    "this situation is drastically different from classical turbulence ( ct ) realized in classical fluids because the circulation of velocity field is not quantized in this system .",
    "therefore , the element of qt is more obvious than that in ct , and qt is believed to be useful for the understanding of ct .",
    "recently , a new trend begins to appear in turbulence study in atomic becs , which is turbulence in multi - component becs @xcite .",
    "atomic becs have various characteristic features , one of which is a realization of multicomponent becs @xcite . in this system",
    ", there exists not only a velocity field but also a ( quasi ) spin field . owing to the spin degrees of freedom , various topological excitations such as monopole , skyrmion , knot , domain wall , and vortex",
    "therefore , in this system , one expects novel turbulence , in which both the velocity and spin fields are much disturbed and various topological excitations are generated .",
    "thus , this kind of turbulence should give us new observations for turbulence not found in conventional systems .",
    "previously , we studied turbulence in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor bec , which is a typical multicomponent bec @xcite . in this turbulence , the spin field",
    "is disturbed , so that we call it spin turbulence ( st ) . in our previous study",
    ", we focused on the spectrum of the spin - dependent interaction energy corresponding to the spin correlation , finding the characteristic @xmath1 power law .",
    "however , this observation sees only one side of st . in st ,",
    "the velocity and spin fields interact with each other , so that a coupled turbulence with two fields can be realized , lending the possibility of showing a property of the velocity field not seen in conventional ct and qt . studying the both sides of turbulence completes the story .    in this paper",
    ", we treat this problem , focusing on the spectrum of the superflow kinetic energy in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor bec .",
    "the spectrum of the kinetic energy is theoretically and numerically found to show a kolmogorov spectrum through the interaction between the spin and velocity fields .",
    "the kolmogorov spectrum refers to the @xmath0 power law in the kinetic energy spectrum , which is known to appear in ct and qt @xcite .",
    "this spectrum is considered to be related to the vortex dynamics , so that it is significant to confirm it for understanding the turbulence addressed here .",
    "furthermore , when the @xmath0 power law is sustained , the spectrum of the spin - dependent interaction energy exhibits a @xmath1 power law simultaneously .",
    "therefore , we obtain the coupled turbulence with the disturbed spin and superfluid velocity fields sustaining the two power laws , anew calling it spin - superflow turbulence ( sst ) instead of st .",

    "this was discussed in the previous study @xcite .",
    "we note that this @xmath0 power law in sst is much different from that in ct . in three ( two)-dimensional ct",

    "this suggests that the mechanism responsible for the @xmath0 power law in sst should be different from that in ct .    finally , the assumptions used in the derivation of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 power laws are discussed .",
