    "the top quark , with its high mass , provides unique measurements in collider physics .",
    "it has a lifetime that is shorter than the hadronization time scale",
    ". therefore , its `` bare '' quark properties are accessible such as spin , charge , and mass .",
    "the lhc run i measurements presented in this paper include top quark pair @xmath0 spin correlation ( section 2 ) , asymmetries ( section 3 ) , top quark mass ( section 4 ) . in addition , a first look at the underlying event in @xmath0 events produced in proton - proton collisions at the lhc with a center of mass energy @xmath1 13 tev is presented in section 6 .",
    "heavy quark spins are correlated in heavy quark production by qcd . top quarks decay in a timescale shorter than the spin decorrelation timescale @xmath2 s , so that the spin correlation information is propagated to the decay products @xcite .",
    "this correlation can be measured with or without reconstructing the @xmath0 system .",
    "the double differential @xmath0 cross section with respect to the top and top antiquark decay angles is proportional to @xmath3 . here , @xmath4 is the angle between the top quark and the positively charged lepton ( in the @xmath0 rest frame ) and @xmath5 between the top antiquark and the negatively charged lepton .",
    "the correlation coefficient , c , is proportional to the spin correlation strength ( @xmath6 ) and the product of the spin analyzing powers of the decay particles , @xmath7 .",
    "the spin analyzing power for each decay product at next - to leading order ( nlo ) is given in @xcite .",
    "charged leptons have the highest spin analyzing power ( 99.8% ) , therefore measuring the spin correlation is easiest in the di - lepton channel where both the top and the top antiquark in the event decay to lepton - neutrino pairs .",
    "the down - type quarks have relatively large spin analyzing power ( 96.6% ) , while the up - type quarks have only 30% .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to distinguish up- and down - type quarks .",
    "because of these reasons , measuring the spin correlation in the lepton+jets channel is more difficult than in the dilepton channel .",
    "the spin correlation strength , @xmath6 , depends on the basis selected for spin - quantization , the final state , and is given by the asymmetry of the number of aligned and anti - aligned top and top antiquark spins . a basis and channel independent quantity , the fraction of @xmath0 events with the sm prediction of spin correlation @xmath8 can be defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of @xmath0 events that display sm spin correlation and @xmath11 indicates the number uncorrelated @xmath0 events . the spin correlated fraction , @xmath8 can be used to determine @xmath12 using the sm value of a determined for the selected basis and channel , @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",

    "the spin correlation is measured using three different asymmetry variables .",
    "these asymmetries are defined through the asymmetries of different angular variables ( @xmath16 ) constructed from the two final state leptons @xmath17 here , @xmath16 is taken to be @xmath18 , @xmath19 , or @xmath20 .",

    "the helicity angle , @xmath27 , is defined to be the angle of the lepton and its parent quark ( or antiquark ) momentum direction in the @xmath0 center - of - mass frame , i.e. the helicity frame .",
    "the third asymmetry variable , @xmath28 , provides a direct measurement of the spin correlation coefficient @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the angle between the two lepton momenta in their respective parent top and antiquark s rest frames .",

    "spin correlation measurement is more challenging in the lepton+jets channel due to the smaller spin analyzing power of quarks , the difficulty in distinguishing jets from up and down type quarks , and the lower resolution of jets compared to leptons . because of these reasons , a multi - varied method , the matrix element method ,",
