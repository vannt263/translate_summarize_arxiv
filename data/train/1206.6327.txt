    "the general problem that inspired radio labeling is what has been known as the channel assignment problem : the goal is to assign radio channels in a way so as to avoid interference between radio transmitters that are geographically close . the problem was first put into a graph theoretic context by hale @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the approach is to model the location of the transmitters via a graph with the transmitters corresponding to the vertices of the graph .",
    "labels corresponding to the frequencies are assigned to the vertices so that vertices that are close to each other in the graph receive labels with large absolute difference .",
    "exactly how large this absolute difference is varies in different models giving rise to several different kinds of labelings that are collectively known as @xmath12-radio labelings .",
    "chartrand and zhang were first to define @xmath12-radio labeling of graphs in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a connected graph and let @xmath13 denote the distance between two distinct vertices @xmath2 and @xmath3 of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the diameter of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath12-radio labeling condition is that given @xmath12 , with @xmath15 , and @xmath6 a labeling , then @xmath16 for all distinct vertices @xmath17 in @xmath0 . with this definition ,",
    "one tries to minimize the largest value used as a label .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath12-radio labeling is actually a generalization of the classical idea of vertex coloring .",
    "vertex coloring corresponds to @xmath12-radio labeling with @xmath18 .",
    "2-radio labeling is also known as @xmath19 labeling .",
    "this is a labeling where adjacent vertices have labels with absolute difference at least @xmath20 and vertices distance 2 apart have labels with absolute difference at least @xmath21 .",
    "this type of labeling was first studied by griggs and yeh in @xcite . since",
    "then a large body of literature has been compiled including the survey paper , @xcite .",
    "another important specific @xmath12-radio labeling is when @xmath22 .",
    "this is one of the most widely studied types of @xmath12-radio labelings and is known simply as a radio labeling , or multilevel distance labeling .",
    "this is the labeling that this paper will focus on so below are the relevant definitions .    a _ radio labeling _",
    "@xmath6 of @xmath0 is an assignment of positive integers to the vertices of @xmath0 such that for every two distinct vertices @xmath2 and @xmath3 of @xmath0 the inequality @xmath23 , called the _ radio condition _",
    ", is satisfied .",
    "the maximum integer in the range of the labeling is its _",

    "determine the radio number of graphs with @xmath9 vertices and diameter @xmath10 , i.e. , paths .",
    "in this paper we determine the radio number of all graphs with @xmath9 vertices and diameter @xmath11 .",
    "much of this paper will be devoted to studying a family of graphs which we call spire graphs .",
    "let @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the spire graph @xmath28 is the graph with vertices @xmath29 , and edges @xmath30 together with the edge @xmath31 .",
    "the vertex @xmath32 is called _ the spire_. without loss of generality we will always assume that @xmath33 .",

    "_    @xmath35    based on this result in section [ sec : others ] we will also determine the radio numbers of all other graphs with @xmath9 vertices and diameter @xmath11 .    in her paper",
    "@xcite liu establishes bounds for the radio numbers of trees . in particular",
    "she determines the exact radio numbers of spire graphs with an odd number of vertices and of spire graphs when the spire is very close to the middle of the path .",
    "although our techniques easily cover these cases as well , in the interest of brevity we will quote liu s results whenever feasible .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : upper ] , we find an upper bound for the radio number of spire graphs by presenting algorithms for labeling them .",
    "even though in some cases such upper bounds have been established in @xcite , we nevertheless present our algorithms for all cases as these algorithms will be used again in section [ sec : others ] . in section [ sec : techniques ] , we establish techniques we will use in section [ sec : lower ] to find a lower bound for the radio number of spire graphs . when @xmath9 is odd , the lower bound follows directly from @xcite so we simply quote the result .",
    "the same is true when @xmath9 is even and the spire is very close to the middle of the path .",
    "however , when @xmath9 is even and the spire is not near the middle of the path we introduce a number of new techniques that are likely to be applicable to other graphs that have large diameter .",
    "it is worth noting that these techniques can be used to easily reprove the lower bound for paths ( both odd and even ) found in @xcite . in section [ sec : others ] , we analyze all remaining order @xmath9 graphs with diameter @xmath11 . in most cases their radio number can be found by thinking of them as a spire graph with some additional edges .",
    "this section also has a number of lemmas that should be useful in other contexts .",
    "[ thm : upper ] let @xmath28 be a spire graph , where @xmath34 .",
    "then ,      to establish this bound we define a labeling with the appropriate span .",
    "the cases for @xmath9 even and @xmath9 odd are discussed separately . + * case 1 : * first consider the case when @xmath37 for some @xmath38 .          now , rename the vertices of @xmath28 in the above ordering by @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , etc . in table [ table 1 ] we define a labeling @xmath6 of @xmath28 .",
    "we will let @xmath48 .",
    "the first column in the table gives the order in which the vertices are labeled , i.e. , the inequality @xmath49 always holds .",
    "the second column reminds the reader which vertex we are labeling . in the third column",
    "we have computed the distance between @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "finally in the last column we give the difference between the labels @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "given that @xmath48 , one can use the last column to compute @xmath52 by summing the first @xmath54 entries of the column and then adding one to this sum .",

    "+       _ proof of claim : _ we let the reader verify that the radio condition holds for all vertices @xmath55 . in this case , the diameter of @xmath56 is @xmath57 so for every @xmath58 with @xmath59 , @xmath60 must hold .",
    "+ letting @xmath48 , the largest number in the range of the radio labeling @xmath6 is then @xmath61 and is therefore equal to the sum of the entries in the last column of table [ table 9 ] plus one .",
    "we let the reader verify that @xmath62 as desired . + * claim : * @xmath63 .",
    "+ we find a lower bound for @xmath64 by using lemma [ lemma : distance ] and determining @xmath65 .",
    "for @xmath66 let @xmath67 be the edge between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 be the three edges incident to @xmath73 where @xmath70 is incident to @xmath74 , @xmath71 is incident to @xmath75 and @xmath72 is incident to @xmath76 ( see figure [ fig : spiregraphs_1,2 ] ) . by the third conclusion of lemma [ lem : distances ]",
    "it follows that      furthermore by lemma [ lem : multiple ] it follows that @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "finally @xmath80 as it is only contained in a path with endpoints @xmath81 and @xmath73 .",
    "note that if all three of these inequalities are equalities , then @xmath81 and @xmath73 correspond to @xmath82 and @xmath83 by the first conclusion of lemma [ lem : distances ] as these are the only vertices for which the sum of the @xmath84 for the incident edges may be odd . at the same time @xmath81 and @xmath73",
    "must correspond to @xmath50 and @xmath51 for some @xmath85 as @xmath86 .",
    "this is a contradiction .",
