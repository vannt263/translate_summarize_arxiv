    "spectra of the prompt soft gamma - ray emission of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are still not explained and seem mysterious despite large theoretical efforts devoted to this problem .",
    "already in the 1980-ies it was recognized that synchrotron emission from the electrons injected at high energies produces cooling spectra @xmath4 ( described by a photon spectral index @xmath5 ) which are much too soft to be consistent with that observed from grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the problem became acute when @xcite showed that the time - resolved spectra have the mean observed @xmath6 close to @xmath7 ( i.e. @xmath8 ) and some spectra can be as hard as @xmath9 . in spite of these facts ,",
    "many different versions of the synchrotron shock models were proposed recently ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to explain grb spectra .",
    "@xcite hypothesized that inverse compton scattering of synchrotron self - absorbed radiation can be responsible for the observed hard batse ( i.e. in the range 201000 kev ) spectra under an assumption that electrons emit in a _ slow _",
    "cooling regime , which , however , is hardly possible in the grb ejecta @xcite .    in principle , efficient cooling of electrons can be prevented by their reacceleration @xcite . in synchrotron models , this requires the fraction of particles taking part in that process to be orders of magnitudes smaller than the total number of particles ( not to exceed the available energy ) and they should always be the same @xcite , conditions that are difficult to imagine",
    ".    problems with the relativistic synchrotron ( and self - compton ) models gave rise to optically thick emission models such as quasi - thermal comptonization @xcite , where the energy is shared among many particles which are now mildly relativistic .",
    "if the synchrotron radiation is self - absorbed , one can achieve rather hard spectra with the peak at 1050 kev in the comoving frame of the ejecta .",
    "for the bulk lorentz factor @xmath10 , this peak shifts , however , to an uncomfortably high energy .    in this paper we show that optically thin synchrotron self - compton mechanism operating at parameters expected in the grb ejecta can naturally produce very hard spectra peaking in the batse energy band , if the available energy is shared among all particles and the particles are continuously accelerated / heated over the life - time of a source . in such conditions ,",
    "the electron / pair distribution develops a prominent peak at a lorentz factor @xmath11 , where synchrotron and compton losses are balanced by particle acceleration and heating due to synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "a copious pair production reduces available energy per particle , moving the spectral peak to lower energies as the burst progresses , reproducing thus the hard - to - soft evolution observed in time - resolved spectra @xcite .",
    "high energy emission observed in some grbs ( e.g. grb  941017 , * ? ? ? * ) , and the prompt optical emission observed in grb  990123 @xcite also can be explained in this model simultaneously .",
    "let us consider the ejecta moving with lorentz factor @xmath12 at the distance @xmath13 from the source .",
    "the main parameters determining radiation physics are the ( comoving ) energy dissipation rate , magnetic field strength @xmath14 , size of the emission region @xmath15 , and the number of particles described by the thomson optical depth @xmath16 .",
    "it is suitable to describe the available energy by the comoving compactness [ eq : defcomp ] = c^2 r , where @xmath17 is the comoving density of a relevant kind of energy .",
    "formally , @xmath18 is just the optical depth @xmath19 of pairs if we would spend all available energy for their mass . in reality",
    ", most energy goes to radiation and the resulting @xmath20 ( e.g. , @xmath21 at @xmath22 and @xmath23 at @xmath24 ) .",
    "the role of magnetic fields can be described by the magnetic compactness @xmath25 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : defcomp ] ) with @xmath26 . the ratio @xmath27 is model dependent .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is below equipartition , i.e. @xmath28 . even in magnetically dominating models",
    ", one does not expect necessarily @xmath29 , since reconnection of magnetic field providing the energy dissipation can reduce its strength _ within _ the emission region to @xmath30 .",
    "it is evident that @xmath15 should not exceed the size of the causally connected region , i.e. @xmath31 in both transversal and radial direction ( the latter in the observer s frame is @xmath32 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath33 and measure the comoving time @xmath34 in units of the light crossing time of the region @xmath35 which corresponds to the observer time @xmath36 .",
    "the dissipation compactness ( corresponding to the energy dissipation _ rate _ ) is then @xmath37 .",
    "( for a constant dissipation rate during @xmath38 we get @xmath39 . )",
    "it can be estimated from the observed isotropic energy release @xmath40 assuming that the energy was dissipated homogeneously in a causally connected region [ eq : comp ] = c^2 4 r^2 = 7  _ 2 ^ -1 r_15 ^ -2 .",
    "( here we adopt notation @xmath41 in cgs units if not mentioned otherwise . )",
    "figure  [ fig : map ] demonstrates the levels of the compactness and the observed time - scale on a @xmath42 plane .",
    "the observed emission episode at the first glance should be a single pulse of time - scale @xmath36 . actually , most of grbs have a complex time structure",
    ". we can then prescribe this episode to a single grb pulse and associate @xmath40 with its energy fluence , or to admit that the energy can be released by compact flares within the causally connected region . in that case , @xmath40 should be referred to the fluence of a complex emission episode and eq .",
    "( [ eq : comp ] ) then gives an average compactness in the region while the local values of @xmath43 can be substantially higher .",
    "what is the typical size @xmath13 where the energy dissipation takes place ?",
    "for radii smaller than @xmath44 , the compactness is large @xmath45 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : map ] ) , pair production is extremely efficient , and the mean energy available per particle is rather small .",
    "the main emission mechanism is then multiple compton scattering .",
    "the spectra expected from this regime can be hard @xcite , but peaked at too high energies ( 1050 kev in the comoving frame ) . at @xmath46 ,",
    "the compactness and optical depth are smaller , the mean energy available per particle larger and the energy is radiated away by optically thin or synchrotron or synchrotron self - compton emission .    the dissipation radius is also limited from above by deceleration of ejecta in the external environment @xmath47 where the ejecta sweeps up mass @xmath48 ( see solid lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : map ] ) .",
    "here @xmath49 is the isotropic kinetic energy of the ejecta , @xmath50 is particle concentration in the interstellar medium , @xmath51 is the mass loss rate by the progenitor star in units @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the wind velocity in units @xmath54 .",
    "we notice that the deceleration limit in the wind case restricts the low compactness ( @xmath55 ) regime to a relatively narrow region of parameters .",
    "if the kinetic energy is @xmath56 , or the environment is denser , then the low - compactness regime is hardly possible at all .",
    "thus we consider the typical dissipation radius @xmath57",
    ". the observed pulse duration of about 1 s is consistent with the fact that grbs have very little power at time - scales below 1 s @xcite .",
    "the optical depth @xmath19 in the emission region is bounded from above by the opacity of the ejecta _",
    "ej = 0.3   e_k,54  r_15 ^ -2  _ 2 ^ -1 ( assuming matter dominated ejecta and that the matter is concentrated within a causally connected shell ) . for external shocks ,",
    "@xmath19 can not be smaller than that determined by collected material [ eq : tauext ] _ ext = \\ {    ll 210 ^ -4  _ -5  r_15 ^ -1  w_3 ^ -1 , & + 210 ^ -8   r_17  n_ism , &    .",
    "what is the physical mechanism of the energy dissipation ? in the external shock models",
    "@xcite , the dissipation occurs at @xmath58 which can be about @xmath59 for the wind environment if @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : map ] ) .",
    "the impulsive first - order fermi acceleration would operate in a fast cooling regime ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a specific version of this scenario ) which , as discussed in the introduction , contradicts the data .",
    "an alternative version of shock energy dissipation is particle heating by plasma instabilities behind the shock front ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we follow this route here .",
    "it can also operate in internal or ` refreshed ' shocks which could be produced by collisions of fresh ejecta with previously ejected , partially decelerated material . in the poynting flux dominated models @xcite , the magnetic field energy can be dissipated at the required distances .",
    "as we have seen a number of models can satisfy our requirements .",
    "thus we do not specify the exact model for the energy dissipation , but consider a toy model where energy is injected to the emission region with the constant rate during comoving time @xmath62 .",
    "we adopt a slab geometry of the emission region which , in a zero approximation , is consistent with both internal and external shock scenarios .",
    "indeed , we can expect that the main energy release takes place behind the shock front in a layer which is thin relative to the size of the causally connected region .",
    "this geometry can also be a satisfactory approximation for the magnetic reconnection scenario .",
    "indeed , the magnetic field is probably predominantly transversal and the reconnection plane is again perpendicular to the direction of propagation .",
    "we neglect the curvature of the shock front and the bulk velocity gradient thus reducing the problem to a static slab . in this approach",
    "we omit a number of effects associated with relativistic expansion of the emitting shell .",
    "these effects are important for the description of the time evolution , however they are not critical for understanding general spectral properties .",
    "the thickness of the emitting slab , @xmath63 ( in units of @xmath15 ) , is unknown since it depends on the relaxation process behind the shock front and is probably smaller in the case of the reconnection scenario .",
    "we take @xmath64 , but the results are not very sensitive to its value .",
    "the energy release is uniform over the slab volume and we assume that the energy is injected in a form of acceleration of electrons and pairs which obtain equal amount of energy per unit time",
    ". the optical depth can increase due to pair production .",
    "we treat the magnetic field geometry as chaotic , therefore all pairs are isotropic .",
    "the model is fully described by four parameters : ( i ) the initial thomson optical depth across the slab , @xmath65 ; ( ii ) comoving size @xmath15 ; ( iii ) dissipation compactness @xmath43 ; and ( iv ) magnetic compactness @xmath25 .",
    "let us first consider how particles ( electron and positrons ) of lorentz factor @xmath66 are heated and how do they cool .",
    "the energy gain rate of a particle is simply given by the heating rate @xmath67 divided by the number of particles which is proportional to the total thomson optical depth ( including pairs ) across the slab @xmath19 .",
    "particles cool by emitting synchrotron radiation and by scattering this radiation ( self - compton mechanism ) .",
    "the energy balance equation can be written as : [ eq : enebal ] = - ( + ) ^2 . here",
    "@xmath68 accounts for the reduced synchrotron cooling due to synchrotron self - absorption , and @xmath69 is the compactness corresponding to the energy density of soft photons in the thomson regime ( with energy @xmath70 ) . the typical cooling time is then @xmath71 $ ] , which , for the grb conditions , is orders of magnitude smaller than the light - crossing time .",
    "the balance between heating and cooling is achieved at [ eq : gampeak ] ^-1/2 , where @xmath69 and @xmath72 also depend on @xmath73 .",
    "particles with @xmath74 lose energy faster than they gain it , while at @xmath75 the situation is opposite . as a result ,",
    "a very narrow electron distribution peaked at @xmath73 develops .",
    "this allows us to adopt the approximation that all particles have the same lorentz factor @xmath76 .",
    "the radiation compactness @xmath69 can be expressed as a sum of the synchrotron @xmath77 and first compton scattering @xmath78 energy densities ( further scattering orders are in the klein - nishina limit ) . in the adopted approximation ,",
    "the compton parameter is just @xmath79 , where the geometrical factor @xmath80 for a spherical source and @xmath81 for a slab with @xmath64 .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : gampeak ] ) is reduced to [ eq : yyylll ] y(1+y+y^2)/ ( ) . when synchrotron self - absorption is negligible , @xmath82",
    ", we find the solution @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 , if the second compton scattering operates close to the klein - nishina limit ) . at small @xmath72 , compton parameter increases .",
    "the importance of self - absorption depends crucially on @xmath66 .",
    "the optical depth at frequencies below the synchrotron emission peak is ( eq . 2.18a in * ? ? ? * ) [ eq : taus ] = 15 /(b^5 x^5/3 ) , x=/(3 ^ 2 b ) , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "thus the emission will be significantly reduced if the self - absorption frequency ( where @xmath87 ) is above the emission peak ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "this happens at @xmath89 .",
    "the same condition for @xmath19 expressed via compton parameter is @xmath90 .",
    "we now can predict the temporal evolution of the radiation spectrum .",
    "the optical depth starts growing after about two light - crossing times @xmath91 required to produce high energy photons . if @xmath92 , the synchrotron is not absorbed and @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and the synchrotron peak energy decreases with optical depth as @xmath95 .",
    "the first compton peak evolves even faster @xmath96 .",
    "when @xmath19 grows above @xmath97 , @xmath72 decreases because of self - absorption , @xmath98 correspondingly increases ( eq .  [ eq : yyylll ] ) , the synchrotron peak becomes more stable , and the resulting electron energy and the first compton peak start to evolve slower .",
    "the second compton peak is produced in the klein - nishina limit at small @xmath19 , and evolves slowly @xmath99 , while at larger @xmath19 the evolution speeds up .",
    "we now check there predictions by numerical simulations .",
