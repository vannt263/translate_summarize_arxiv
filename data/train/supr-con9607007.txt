    "the hybridisation @xmath57 in ( [ equ - gf - hf ] ) indeed reproduces the btk result for @xmath58 .",
    "but for the hf case a strongly reduced v-shape sc anomaly is found for an ideal metallic point contact ( @xmath59 ) . the worse",
    "the contact ( @xmath60 ) the more btk - like is the shape of an ideal contact , but its size is strongly reduced at zero bias . because we have chosen a fixed order parameter @xmath61 the renormalization due to the strongly reduced quasi - particle spectral weight leads to the shrinking of the gap .",
    "the inset shows a blow - up of the @xmath62 curve .",
    "this would come close to some of the spectra observed for upt@xmath2 .",
    "the asymmetry reflects the asymmetry between the normal electrode ( treated by a constant density of states ) and the hfsc .",
    "according to our above calculations the almost flat spectra with small double - minimum structure are accessible only within a very narrow parameter range when coupling is reduced to about @xmath63 .",
    "this could be one of the reasons why those spectra are very hard to detect @xcite . note that even with an isotropic order parameter spectra different from the btk predictions can be obtained using a energy dependent quasi - particle life - time .",
    "we ought to mention some drawbacks to our approach : the energy - dependence of the quasi - particle lifetime requires a self - consistent determination of the spatial - dependent potential to model contacts in the easily accessible resistance range ( @xmath64 ) . in an eliashberg - type of calculation of the sc state the onset of quasi - particle lifetime effects",
    "is expected to be shifted self - consistently towards the gap - edges .",
    "and we can not explain the often found enhancement of the ballistic zero - bias resistance .",
    "a recent systematic study on the size of the sc anomalies clearly shows a scaling with the orifice radius rather than with the area @xcite .",
    "this could indicate that a nns - junction is seen in most of the experiments with a ns - boundary inside the hf material .",
    "such a scenario would be also favoured in the case of an anisotropic order parameter , since the surface then acts as a pair - braking boundary .",
    "a reminiscence of sc is found in the normal - state hf part of the junction , since it is known - or can be easily derived using eq.([equ - g - ret ] ) - that the non - equilibrium renormalized normal side has a gap at @xmath65 in its spectral function induced by the superconductor it is coupled to , which is maintained through large distances ( in a pure quasi - particle picture this distance is infinite ) .      after finishing our work",
    "we became aware , that other authors @xcite have also derived the btk - theory using an hamiltonian approach to pcs .",
