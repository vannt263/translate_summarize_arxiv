    "the solutions to many important physical problems , such as electromagnetic waves in waveguides @xcite , lasing modes in nanostructures @xcite , the electronic structure of graphene @xcite and the quantum eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for various potential energies @xcite are obtained by solving the ubiquitous helmholtz equation    @xmath3    in this paper we discuss the solutions to this equation when the region of interest is an equilateral triangle ( @xmath4 ) and when the solutions vanish on the boundary ( i.e. when they satisfy the dirichlet condition @xmath5 ) . although the explicit solutions in this case are well - known , ( @xcite , @xcite),@xcite , @xcite ) we present an alternative method of obtaining them that does not involve solving the differential equation directly , but rather uses only symmetry arguments , or a differential operator derived from symmetry considerations alone , to generate new solutions from any given solution .",
    "our method is based upon first showing that each solution within the equilateral triangle is a member of one of four symmetry classes , and then introducing symmetry operators and a differential operator which transform solutions in one symmetry class into those of another or from one value of @xmath1 to another .",
    "obviously any method that generates one or more new solutions to the helmholtz equation from a given solution is quite a powerful and useful tool .",
    "the fact that the new solutions are generated from symmetry transformations alone rather than by solving the helmholtz equation directly makes the method even more attractive .",
    "the method also has the advantage of being able to produce solutions with prescribed symmetries , which can be important if the desired solution needs , or is known to possess , certain symmetries .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ math ] we establish our notation while reviewing the results from representation theory and linear algebra which are used in the rest of the paper . in section [ sec : rep3 ] we show that every solution to the helmholtz equation within an equilateral triangle , which obeys the dirichlet conditions on the boundary , is a member of one of four symmetry classes . in section [ sec : res1 ]",
    "we show how to take a solution from any one of the four classes and generate from it solutions in a different symmetry class and/or with different values of the scalar @xmath1 . in section [ sec : ground ] we use our approach to obtain the explicit solution to the helmholtz equation with the lowest value of @xmath1 , i.e. the  ground state solution . \" in section [ sec : con1 ] we summarize our results and discuss the various ways in which they can be applied .",
    "in particular , we discuss the correspondence between solutions in the equilateral and @xmath2 triangles .",
    "a representation is a homomorphism @xmath6 from the group @xmath7 into the group of linear transformations of a vector space ( in our case , the real numbers suffice ) , which we denote by @xmath8gl@xmath9 .",
    "the representation assigns to each group element a transformation of the vector space that is consistent with the multiplication table of the group . for the dihedral group @xmath10",
    ", every such representation can be decomposed into a direct product of three irreducible representations .",
    "before we can describe these homomorphisms we need to describe the elements of the group @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 be a @xmath12 counter - clockwise rotation about the center of an equilateral triangle and @xmath13 be a reflection ( without loss of generality ) about the @xmath14axis , as shown in figure ( [ group ] ) .",
    "the defining relationship of the dihedral group says that @xmath15 .",
    "since these two elements generate the whole group , we need only define each homomorphism on these generators .",
    "listing the elements of the group , we have    @xmath16    the first irreducible representation is called the _ trivial _ representation because it maps every group element to the identity map of @xmath17 .",
    "while this may seem somewhat , well , trivial , it actually plays an interesting role later on .",

    "the second representation is called the _ sign _ representation , though it also could be called the _ orientation _ representation , because it shows whether a reflection has occurred .",
    "that is , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "obviously the trivial and sign representations are one dimensional .",
    "the third representation is the only one that displays every nuance in the group , and it therefore is sometimes used to define @xmath10 . unlike the two previous representations , @xmath22 is a two dimensional representation whose elements ( in gl@xmath23 ) are    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the previous section we showed how eq.([f1 ] ) can be used to generate a solution in the symmetry class e2 ( i.e. a solution that is anti - symmetric when reflected about the @xmath24-axis ) from any solution in the symmetry class e1 ( i.e. from a solution that is symmetric when reflected about the @xmath24-axis ) and _ vice versa _ ( using eq.([f2 ] ) ) . more specifically ,",
    "if we have a solution that is even in the @xmath25-coordinate and asymmetric under rotations @xmath11 , then we can generate from it a solution that is odd in the @xmath25-coordinate and asymmetric under rotations @xmath11 , and _",

    "we begin by quoting a theorem usually attributed to lam , using the statement ( and referring the reader to the proof ) given by mccartin @xcite :    [ lame ] ( lam ) suppose that @xmath26 is a solution to the helmholtz equation which can be represented by the trigonometric series @xmath27 with @xmath28",
    ". then    1 .",
    "@xmath26 is antisymmetric about any line along which it vanishes ; 2 .",
    "@xmath26 is symmetric about any line along which its normal derivative , @xmath29 , vanishes .",
    "lam @xcite also proves that the solutions to the helmholtz equation in a triangular region subject to the dirichlet conditions can be expressed in this way and that they form a complete , orthonormal set .",
    "explicit expressions for these solutions are also given by doncheski _",
    "@xcite      in order to relate solutions in the symmetry classes e2 and a2 we use a method called  tessellating the plane , \" which extends any solution within the triangular domain to the plane .",
    "we begin the tessellation by defining the triangular region in which we are working as the  fundamental domain \" and then we reflect this domain across each of its three boundaries .",
    "an example of this construction is shown in figure ( [ tile ] ) .",
    "tessellating the plane provides a way to smoothly extend the solution from the triangular region of interest to the plane .",
    "we begin by considering a solution @xmath31 in the symmetry class e2 .",
    "since @xmath31 is antisymmetric under reflection it must be zero along the @xmath24 axis .",
    "thus , any solution in the symmetry class e2 will have the form shown in figure ( [ e2a2]a ) , with possibly more nodal curves .",
    "similarly , if a solution is in the symmetry class a2 , it not only needs a nodal line along the @xmath24-axis , but also along the other altitudes .",
    "thus , any solution in the symmetry class a2 will have the form shown in figure ( [ e2a2]b ) , with possibly more nodal curves .    by examining the equilateral triangles in figure ( [ e2a2 ] )",
    "we see that the linear transformation    @xmath32 \\right)= \\frac{1}{6 } \\left [ \\begin{tabular}{c } $ 3 x + \\sqrt{3 } y + 3 $ \\\\",
    "$ -\\sqrt{3 } x + 3 y + \\sqrt{3}$ \\end{tabular } \\right]\\ ] ]    maps the dashed region in figure ( [ e2a2]a ) into the dashed region in figure ( [ e2a2]b ) [ the origin is one unit from each vertex ] .",
    "the a2 solution can then be constructed by tessellating the dashed triangle in figure ( [ e2a2]b ) and thus creating the triangle in that figure who boundaries are shown with the solid lines .",
    "therefore , the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) , which is deduced from the figures , takes _ any _ solution in the e2 symmetry class and transforms it into a solution in the a2 symmetry class . having determined the explicit form of the transformation from the tessellation we can rewrite the helmholtz equation in the new coordinates and deduce the new value of the scalar term . in this way we can construct an explicit solution in a2 from any given solution in e2 and determine the scalar term associated with it .",
    "we carry out this calculation explicitly in appendix i and show that if the original function in e2 is a solution of the helmholtz equation with the scalar @xmath1 , then the solution in a2 generated from it will be a solution of the helmholtz equation with the scalar @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , if we start with a solution in a2 ( rather than e2 ) of the helmholtz equation with the scalar @xmath1 , then the same argument will produce another solution in a2 but with the scalar @xmath34 . in summary",
    "if we start with any function in a2 or e2 that is a solution to the helmholtz equations with the scalar @xmath1 then , using the method presented in appendix i , we can generate a function in a2 that is a solution to the helmholtz equation with the scalar @xmath33 .",
    "the proof given in appendix i is reversible , so if we start at the end of the argument with a function in a2 which is a solution of the helmholtz equation with scalar @xmath1 , then we can run the argument backwards and generate another solution which is in either a2 or e2 . in both cases the function produced",
    "will be a solution of the helmholtz equation with the scalar * @xmath35*. however , since there exists a solution with the lowest allowed value of @xmath1 ( the  ground state solution \" ) the process of generating solutions with smaller values of the scalar must stop .",
    "we discuss this situation in the next section .",
    "note that this method establishes a many - to - one correspondence between solutions in symmetry class a2 and symmetry class e2 .",
    "although we can use the proof presented in the appendix i to generate from a solution in a2 with the scalar @xmath1 new solutions in a2 or e2 with three times the value of the scalar @xmath1 , there is a more direct way to take a solution and generate from it solutions with higher values of the scalar for solutions from _ any _ symmetry class . to do this we carry out a different tessellation of the plane and then extract the new value of the scalar from the coordinate transformation .",
    "the tessellation , which is shown in figure ( [ bst_vs ] ) , decomposes the equilateral triangle into @xmath36 equilateral sub - triangles , for any @xmath37 .",
    "as we show in appendix ii , the explicit coordinate transformation that creates the sub - triangles is constructed from a dilation followed by a translation along the @xmath24-axis . carrying out this transformation we can start with a function in any symmetry class that is a solution of the helmholtz equation with the scalar @xmath1 and generate from it a family of new solutions to the helmholtz equation with scalar @xmath38 .",
    "note that if the original solution is in the symmetry class e2 ( i.e. is rotationally asymmetric ) then this approach will produce a solution in a2 ( i.e. the generated solution will become rotationally symmetric ) whenever @xmath39 is divisible by @xmath40 . in this case , however , we have would have already constructed this solution by using the method from section ( [ sec : e2_a2 ] ) twice .",
    "see figure [ bst_vs ] for a schematic proof of this fact .",
    "note that any solution with a vertical nodal line can be reduced using this method .",
    "extending the solution to the plane , we can use theorem [ lame ] and any vertical nodal line to introduce a new mirror symmetry . combining this with the mirror symmetries about the boundaries and the rotational symmetry",
    ", there will be a fundamental domain without vertical nodal lines .",
    "this represents a solution which can be used to generate the original solution without any vertical nodal lines .      in this section",
    "we prove that there exists a differential operator that transforms a solution @xmath31 in a2 , i.e. a solution that is symmetric under rotations and an odd function of y , into a solution @xmath41 in a1 , that is , into a solution which is symmetric under rotations and an even function of @xmath25 . to show this we construct a function @xmath42 in a1 ( where @xmath41 is the normalized solution ) by defining @xmath42 in the following way :    @xmath43    the proof that @xmath42 is in a1 goes as follows : first , it is easy to see that @xmath42 is a solution to the helmholtz equation with the scalar @xmath1 _ iff _",
    "@xmath31 is a solution with the same scalar @xmath1 . to complete the proof we need to show four more things : first , that @xmath44 is rotationally symmetric , second , that @xmath44 satisfies the dirichlet conditions , third , that @xmath42 is even in the @xmath25-coordinate , and fourth , that @xmath44 is not identically zero .    with single variable functions ,",
    "one common way of generating an even function from an odd function is to take the first derivative .",
    "however , the need to satisfy all of the above conditions requires a more complicated procedure .",
    "the generalization of the first derivative in one dimension to two dimensions is the directional derivative , and the directional derivative of a function @xmath45 is @xmath46 .",
    "we can represent the directional derivative operator in the @xmath47 direction as @xmath48 .",
    "higher order directional derivatives are simply powers of this operator .",
    "as can be easily verified , although the first directional derivative of @xmath31 satisfies the helmholtz equation it would not necessarily have the correct rotational symmetry . to correct this , we can _ symmetrize _ the solution by adding it to both of its rotates .",
    "the resulting solution will now be even and rotationally symmetric .",
    "additionally , the transformed solution will satisfy the boundary ( dirichlet ) condition since any nodal line parallel to a side will remain a nodal line .",
    "this follows from theorem [ lame ] , since every solution is antisymmetric in a nodal line .",
    "thus a directional derivative along the nodal line is zero , and by anti - symmetry the other two directional derivatives will cancel out .",
    "unfortunately , this particular method always yields the trivial solution , so it is not very helpful .",
    "indeed , we can imagine the directional derivatives in the tangent plane , and by symmetry they will always add to zero .",
    "however , this leads us to try the next odd power of the directional derivative in the @xmath25-direction , @xmath49 . once again",
    ", the required rotational symmetry leads us to symmetrize the solution by adding to the third directional derivative in the @xmath25-direction the third directional derivative in the directions parallel to the other two sides .",
    "we can describe the resulting differential operator algebraically by rotating the directional derivative by @xmath11 :    @xmath50    this gives us our differential operator from eq .",
    "( [ even_odd ] ) , apart from a multiplicative constant ( which is unimportant since the resulting solution will still need to be normalized ) . with this new understanding of eq .",
    "( [ even_odd ] ) , we can then argue as before that the new function @xmath42 has the correct symmetry and satisfies the dirichlet conditions . using the helmholtz relation , note",
    "that @xmath51    combining this with our differential operator , we can rewrite it as    @xmath52    written in this way , it is clear the @xmath44 is symmetric in the @xmath24-axis .",
    "the last thing we need to do is show that the solution is non - zero . without loss of generality we can assume there are no vertical nodal lines on the interior of the triangle .",
    "( this is possible using the last paragraph from section [ sec : a1_a1 ] . )    since any solution will be analytic on the interior of the triangle , we consider the power series of the function @xmath53 at the origin",
    ".    @xmath54    let s consider the solution along the @xmath25-axis , @xmath55 . by symmetry ,",
    "we know that there are only odd terms . additionally , note that the directional derivatives at the origin parallel to each side are all zero , also by symmetry .",
    "we have previously argued that the sum of the three directional derivatives parallel to each side gives the zero function , thus @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57    by assumption , @xmath55 is not identically zero , so there is a non - zero term with minimal index . now consider @xmath44 :    @xmath58    using the first non - zero term in the power series for @xmath31 , we note that its third derivative is non - zero , and higher order terms can not cancel it .",
    "thus @xmath44 is non - zero , so we can normalize it to get a new solution @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , we can note that @xmath41 is non - zero almost everywhere .",
    "indeed , if @xmath41 is zero on an open set , then by analyticity it would be zero everywhere .",
    "while we have only shown that this process works for functions in a2 without a node along the @xmath25-axis , the strength of our conclusion shows that this is a local property . combining this with earlier methods , the requirement to be non",
    "- zero along the @xmath25-axis can be eliminated .",
    "it should be noted that the only place we used the fact that @xmath31 was anti - symmetric was to prove that @xmath41 was non - zero .",
    "indeed , the process introduced in eq .",
    "( [ even_odd ] ) can also be used to transform a symmetric solution into an anti - symmetric solution , though the transformed solution may be zero . in the next section",
    "we will show that if a solution in class a1 is transformed by this differential operator and becomes the zero function , then it was ( a harmonic of ) the  ground state . \"",
    "otherwise , the transformed solution can be normalized to a solution in class a2 , giving a one - to - one correspondence between solutions in class a2 and those solutions in a1 which are not harmonics of the ground state .",
    "in the previous section we introduced the differential operator defined in eq . [ even_odd ] ) that transformed anti - symmetric solutions into symmetric solutions .",
    "one natural question is what does this operator do to the solution of the helmholtz equation with the minimum value of @xmath1 , that is , to the `` ground state solution '' ?",
    "since the ground state solution is always non - degenerate , the operator in eq . ( [ even_odd ] ) must transform it into the zero function .",
    "we will now show that any solution from class a1 which transforms to zero under this differential operator is the ground state or a harmonic of the ground state .",
    "let @xmath45 be a solution in symmetry class a1 which satisfies the two equations @xmath59 and @xmath60 using the first equation we can eliminate partial derivatives with respect to @xmath24 from the second equation to obtain @xmath61 putting a solution of the form @xmath62 into the above equation we find that @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "however , since solutions in class a1 are symmetric in @xmath25 , the only allowed solutions are @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "similarly , putting @xmath62 into eq.([gs2 ] ) , we get that @xmath68 and @xmath69 . imposing the boundary condition at @xmath70",

    "@xmath80 note that these two sine waves are horizontally shifted by @xmath81 , so there is a suitable choice of sign for @xmath82 to make them cancel .",
    "putting this all together ,    @xmath83    where @xmath84 .",

    "( [ gs ] ) with the explicit solution given in mccartin , @xcite note that if the inscribed circle has radius @xmath87 then @xmath88 , and if the side length is @xmath89 then @xmath90 . for larger values of @xmath39",
    ", we simply get the harmonics promised at the end of section ( [ sec : a2_a1 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have examined the solutions to the helmholtz equation @xmath0 within an equilateral triangle which obey the dirichlet conditions on the boundary .",
    "we have shown that every solution is a member of one of four symmetry classes and that , from symmetry considerations alone , any given solution in one symmetry class can be used to generate solutions in another symmetry class and/or with other values of the scalar @xmath1 .",
    "we also used symmetry considerations to find a novel derivation of the  ground state \" solution of the helmholtz equation .",
    "these results have many interesting applications .",
    "for example , in some cases we are looking for solutions to the helmholtz equation which possess certain specific reflection or rotational symmetries . referring to the chart at the end of section [ sec : rep3 ]",
    "we see that if we are looking for a solution with the symmetry properties of solutions in the symmetry class a2 , we can generate such a solution if we already have another solution in either symmetry class a1 or symmetry class e2 .",
    "similarly , for any given value of the scalar @xmath1 , we can generate the ground state solution using eq .",
    "( [ gs ] ) and then , since the ground state solution is in symmetry class a1 , use the method presented in section [ sec : rep3 ] to generate solutions with  higher harmonics , \" that is , solutions whose scalar values are @xmath38 .",
    "more generally , given any solution , we can generate many different solutions in different symmetries classes and with different values of the scalar @xmath1 from symmetry considerations alone , and keep generating solutions from each solution generated previously without ever having to solve the helmholtz equation directly .",
    "we end by noting that , when collected together , the techniques in this article shed light on the relationship between solutions within the @xmath2 and equilateral triangles .",
    "for example , solutions to the equilateral triangle which are in symmetry classes a2 and e2 vanish along the @xmath24-axis .",
    "if we restrict our domain @xmath4 to quadrants i and ii , these solutions become solutions to the @xmath2 triangle ( with the same value of @xmath1 ) .",
    "see figures [ a2 ] and [ e2 ] , respectively .",
    "conversely , given a solution in the @xmath2 triangle , we can reflect it across the @xmath24-axis to get a solution in the equilateral triangle that is in either of the symmetry classes a2 or e2 .",
    "we can then take these solutions and construct from them solutions in a1 and e1 using the techniques from section [ sec : a2_a1 ] and section [ sec : rep5 ] , respectively . since both of these techniques are reversible , we know that _ all _ solutions within the equilateral triangle can be found from the solutions in the @xmath2 triangle except for the ground state solution and its harmonics . however , these solutions can be derived directly using the technique in section [ sec : a2_a1 ] , which means that knowing all of the solutions within the @xmath2 triangle enables us to obtain all of the solutions within the equilateral triangle .    in summary ,",
    "apart from providing a new way to generate new solutions from any given solution to the helmholtz equation within a triangle region , our method can also be used to establish two interesting connections between solutions to the helmholtz equation within the equilateral and @xmath2 triangles .",
    "first , the set of solutions within the @xmath2 triangle is a subset of the set of solutions within the equilateral triangle .",
    "second , we have a two - to - one correspondence between the solutions in the equilateral triangle which are not harmonics of the ground state and the solutions of the @xmath2 triangle .",
    "we want to show that the solution @xmath91 is a solution to the differential equation    @xmath92    when @xmath45 is a solution to the differential equation    @xmath93    to make this a bit cleaner , we will need to write the transformation @xmath94 explicitly . solving the system of equations",

    "in this section we examine the properties of solutions obtained by de - composing the fundamental domain into @xmath36 equilateral triangles .",
    "first we show that if we start with a solution @xmath45 in a2 or e2 which is a solution of the helmholtz equation with the scalar @xmath1 then , by decomposing the triangular domain into @xmath36 equilateral triangles , we can generate a solution to the helmholtz equation with scalar @xmath38 .",
    "the transformation of the plane which replaces the original triangle by @xmath36 triangles is a pure dilation by a factor of @xmath39 , followed by a translation along the @xmath24 axis",

    "since the solution inside each of these smaller triangles is the same rotationally symmetric symmetric solution , the resulting solution is rotationally symmetric .",

    "<S> we then show how solutions with different symmetries , or different values of @xmath1 , can be generated from any given solution using symmetry operators or a differential operator derived from symmetry considerations . </S>",
    "<S> our method also provides a novel way of generating the ground state solution ( that is , the solution with the lowest value of @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we establish a correspondence between solutions in the equilateral and @xmath2 triangles . </S>"
