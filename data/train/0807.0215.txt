    "currently , over 1,000 objects are regarded as planetary nebulae ( pne ) in the galaxy ( acker et al .",
    "1992 ) , while 14 of them have been identified as halo members from their location and kinematics since the discovery of k 648 ( ps 1 ) in m 15 .",
    "all halo pne are metal - poor objects ( @xmath5[s / h]@xmath6=@xmath11.3 ; pereira & miranda 2007 ) and are suspected to be descendants of stars formed in the early history of the galaxy .",
    "halo pne should convey important information for the study of the evolution of metal - poor stars as well as the early physical and chemical conditions of the galaxy .",
    "their origins are , however , not well understood yet .",
    "bobn 1 ( pn g108.476.1 ) is a halo pn that is located in the direction of the south galactic pole .",
    "the heliocentric distance to this object is estimated to be between 16.5 kpc ( henry et al .",
    "2004 ) and 29 kpc ( kingsburgh & barlow 1992 ) and the heliocentric radial velocity is + 191.9@xmath20.8 km s@xmath7 ( otsuka 2007 ) .",
    "zijlstra et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have associated bobn 1 with the leading tail of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy , which traces several halo globular clusters .",
    "bobn 1 is an extremely metal - poor ( [ ar / h ] = @xmath12.10@xmath20.21 ; otsuka 2007 ) and c- and n - rich halo pn ( [ c / o ] = + 1.50@xmath20.27 , [ n / o ] = + 1.02@xmath20.13 , [ o / h ] = @xmath10.96@xmath20.05 , according to otsuka 2007 ; [ c / o ] = + 1.32 , [ n / o ] = + 1.07 , [ o / h ] = @xmath11.07 , according to howard et al . 1997 ) , which composes a class of pn together with k 648 and h 4 - 1 .",
    "these c- and n - rich halo pne have some unresolved issues on their origin .",
    "for example , halo pne can become n - rich , but not c - rich , if the initial mass of the progenitor is @xmath30.8 m@xmath4 , which is the turn - off star mass of m 15 , according to the theoretical models of single metal - poor stars ( e.g. , fujimoto et al . 2000 ) . to become c - rich pne , the third dredge - up ( tdu )",
    "must take place in the late asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase .",
    "but , the tdu takes place in stars with initial masses @xmath8 1.21.5 m@xmath4 ( e.g. , straniero et al .",
    "also , current stellar evolutionary models predict that the post - agb evolution of stars with initial masses @xmath30.8 m@xmath4 proceeds too slowly for a visible pn to be formed .",
    "these issues must be resolved before one proceeds to discuss the evolution of metal - poor stars and the early chemical evolution of the galaxy through the observation of halo pne .",
    "chemical abundance analysis of pne is a key tool to investigate these issues .",
    "comparing the observed abundances with those from theoretical evolution and nucleosynthesis models for metal - poor stars will shed light on the origin and evolution of c- and n - rich halo pne . in this paper , we present the first estimation of the fluorine ( f ) abundance of bobn 1 .",
    "the abundances of f and heavy elements via the slow neutron capture process ( the _ s_-process ) , which are synthesized in the he - rich intershell of agb stars and are brought to the surface by the tdu , would be an effective tool to examine how bobn 1 became c- and n - rich , when combined with the c abundance .",
    "we discuss the origin and evolution of bobn 1 by comparing the f and other elemental abundances with the abundances of carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars .",
    "high - dispersion spectra of bobn 1 in the range 3260  to 6680  are available from the european southern observatory ( eso ) archive .",
    "the observations were performed by perinotto & gilmozzi ( prop . i.d . : 69.d-0413a ) on august 4 , 2002 , using the ultraviolet visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ; dekker et al .",
    "2000 ) at the nasmyth b focus of kueyen , the second of four 8.2-m telescopes of the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) at paranal , chile .",
    "the entrance slit size was 11@xmath9 in length and 1@xmath10 in width , giving a spectral resolution of @xmath336,000 .",
    "the sampling pitch along the wavelength dispersion was @xmath30.02  per pixel .",
    "the data were taken as a series of 2700-sec exposures and the total exposure time was 10,800 sec .",
    "the seeing was between 1@xmath11 and 1@xmath10 during the exposure .",
    "the standard star hr 9087 was observed for flux calibration .",
    "data reduction was performed mostly by the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) software package distributed by the national optical astronomy observatory ( noao ) .",
    "we have found candidates of the fluorine forbidden lines [ fiv ] @xmath123996.92 ( transition : @xmath13@xmath14 ) and [ fiv ] @xmath124059.90 ( @xmath13@xmath15 ) .",
    "we show the line profiles of [ fiv ] in figure [ spec ] .",
    "the abscissa and ordinate axes indicate the heliocentric wavelength and the flux density normalized to the total h@xmath16 flux @xmath17(h@xmath16 ) . we have fitted the line - profiles of these [ fiv ] with a single - gaussian .",
    "the resultant fittings are summarized in table [ fl ] .",
    "the second and third columns are the position of the center of the gaussian and the normalized line intensity ( interstellar reddening corrected using @xmath18(h@xmath16 ) = 0.21@xmath20.02 ; otsuka 2007 ) , respectively .",
    "we confirmed that bobn 1 has no high - density components exceeding a critical density of 3@xmath1910@xmath20 @xmath21 at the level of @xmath13 , using the intensity ratios of balmer lines ( h_n _ ; _ n _ ( principal quantum number ) = 3  25 ) to h@xmath16 ( h4 ) , which are sensitive to high electron density ( @xmath22 10@xmath23 @xmath21 ) .",
    "therefore , the effect of collisional de - excitation is negligibly small , so that the intensity ratio of [ fiv ] @xmath24(@xmath124059.90)/@xmath24(@xmath123996.92 ) is proportional to the ratio of their transition probabilities .",
    "when the transition probabilities @xmath25(@xmath13@xmath26 ) = 3.42@xmath1910 @xmath27 s@xmath7 and @xmath25(@xmath13@xmath15 ) = 9.81@xmath1910@xmath27 s@xmath7 given by garstang ( 1951 )  they are in good agreement with storey & zeippen ( 2000 )  are adopted , @xmath24(@xmath124059.90)/@xmath24(@xmath123996.92 ) = 2.82 , which is in good agreement with our measurement ( 3.01@xmath20.40 ) .",
    "hence , these two emission lines can be identified as the fluorine forbidden lines [ fiv ] @xmath123996.92 and [ fiv ] @xmath124059.90 .",
    "the triply ionized fluorine abundance f@xmath28/h@xmath29 has been estimated from the each detected [ fiv ] line by solving the statistical equilibrium equations for the lowest five energy levels ( @xmath30 , @xmath13 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "the collision strength and transition probabilities of [ fiv ] lines are given by lennon & burke ( 1994 ) and garstang ( 1951 ) , respectively .",
    "to estimate f@xmath28/h@xmath29 , we used an electron temperature of @xmath32 = 13,430@xmath2170 k , derived from the ratio of [ oiii ] @xmath24(@xmath124959+@xmath125007)/@xmath24(@xmath124363 ) = 80.05@xmath22.67 , and a density of @xmath33 = 4550@xmath21270 @xmath21 from the ratio of [ ariv ] @xmath24(@xmath124711)/@xmath24(@xmath124740 ) = 1.01@xmath20.08 ( otsuka 2007 ) .",
    "the resultant f@xmath28/h@xmath29 are presented in the fourth column of table [ fl ] , which include the errors of the line intensity , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath18(h@xmath16 ) .",
    "finally , we adopted a value of f@xmath28/h@xmath29 from the intensity of the weighted mean , presented in the fourth column , last line of table [ fl ] .    to estimate the elemental fluorine abundance f",

    "[ neiv ] , and [ nev ] lines have been detected ( otsuka 2007 ) . using the similarity of the ionization potential ranges for f@xmath28 ( 3562.7 ev ) and ne@xmath28 ( 4163.5 ev ) , f / h of bobn 1",
    "may be estimated by the following equations :    @xmath34    where ne / h and ne@xmath28/h@xmath29 are the elemental and triply ionized neon abundances , respectively .",
    "we assume that ne / h of bobn 1 is the sum of ne@xmath35/h@xmath29 , ne@xmath28/h@xmath29 , and ne@xmath36/h@xmath29 .",
    "finally , we estimated f / h as presented in the sixth column , last line of table [ fl ] .    in table [ fl2 ] , we present the [ f / h ] abundance of 11 disk pne and a halo pn ngc 4361 from zhang & liu ( 2005 ) and of ngc 7662 from hyung & aller ( 1997 ) , together with [ c / h ] , [ n / h ] , [ ne / h ] , [ ar / h ] , and [ f / ar ] abundances .",
    "all the abundances of pne in this table originate from the nebula material . for pne , ar is used as metallicity indicator instead of fe , because ar is not depleted by dust . to our knowledge , bobn 1 is the most metal - poor and f - rich pn among f - detected pne .",
    "we also present the abundances of the cemp star he1305 + 0132 ( he 1305 hereafter ) , estimated by schuler et al .",
    "it should be noted that its c and f overabundances are comparable to those of bobn 1 .",
    "since the extremely enhanced f abundances in these objects can not be explained by primordial pollution of material from rapidly - rotating massive stars ( palacios et al .",
    "2005 ) , we assume that f in bobn 1 and he 1305 is mostly produced by nucleosynthesis in the progenitor single star or a possible binary companion .",
    "in low - mass agb stars ( initial mass of 14 m@xmath4 ; herwig 2005 ) suffering the tdu and not the hot bottom burning , the f abundance at the stellar surface is efficiently enhanced .",
    "its only stable isotope , @xmath37f , is synthesized via the @xmath38n(@xmath39,@xmath40)@xmath41f(@xmath42)@xmath41o(_p_,@xmath39)@xmath43n(@xmath39,@xmath40)@xmath37f reaction chain during he - shell burning inside thermal pulses ( tps ) .",
    "fluorine is further carried to the surface of the star by the tdu , together with other products of he burning : mostly @xmath44c , produced via partial he burning , and @xmath45ne produced via double alpha - captures on @xmath38n ( jorissen et al .",
    "1992 ; lugaro et al .",
    "the required protons are provided by the @xmath38n(_n_,_p_)@xmath38c reaction , where the neutrons are produced by the @xmath46c(@xmath39,_n_)@xmath47o reaction , which is activated at temperatures @xmath8 8.9@xmath1910@xmath48 k ( herwig 2004 ) .",
    "the other neutron source reaction , @xmath45ne(@xmath39,_n_)@xmath49 mg , is not a plausible candidate to provide neutrons for the f production because it is activated at higher temperatures , @xmath8 2.8@xmath1910@xmath50 k , at which @xmath38n is already completely destroyed and @xmath37f is also quickly consumed by @xmath37f(@xmath39,_p_)@xmath45ne reactions .",
    "the required @xmath46c and @xmath38n nuclei are ingested in the convective tps where he burning takes place , together with the ashes of the previous h - burning .",
    "note that the abundances of the @xmath46c and @xmath38n nuclei in the h - burning ashes have a primary component at low metallicity due to the fact that efficient tdu carries primary @xmath44c to the stellar envelope , which is then converted into @xmath46c and @xmath38n during h - burning . according to the current stellar models , in low - mass agb stars partial",
    "mixing of the bottom of the h - rich convective envelope into outermost region of the @xmath44c - rich intershell layer leads to synthesis of extra @xmath46c and @xmath38n at the end of the tdu ( e.g. , werner & herwig 2006 ) .",
    "this is necessary to produce enough heavy elements via the _ s_-process in order to match observations of enhancements of , e.g. , zr , ba , and pb , in these stars ( e.g. , busso et al .",
    "2001 ) . during the interpulse phase the @xmath46c(@xmath39,_n_)@xmath47o reaction occurs and neutrons are released .",
    "the presence of a partial mixing zone also contributes some extra f production .",
    "however , due to the uncertainties associated with the formation of this mixing zone ( e.g. , herwig 2005 ) , its contribution to the final f production should be considered as part of the model uncertainties ( e.g. , lugaro et al .",
    "2004 ; karakas et al . 2007 ) .",
    "jorissen et al . ( 1992 for ms / s stars ) and zhang & liu ( 2005 ) showed a strong correlation between @xmath44c and @xmath37f abundances , which is expected if both @xmath44c and @xmath37f are carried to the stellar surface by the tdu .    in figure [ diag](a ) , we show the diagram of [ c / ar ] vs. [ f / ar ] for pne , ms / s stars , and he 1305 .",
    "it clearly shows that [ f / ar ] increases with [ c / ar ] .",
    "figure [ diag](b ) shows a correlation between [ ne / ar ] and [ f / ar ] , which again is to be expected if @xmath45ne is also carried to the surface by the tdu .",
    "figure [ diag](c ) further shows a strong correlation between [ ar / h ] and [ f / ar ] .",
    "this is predicted by the models because of the primary contribution to the f production due to the effect of the tdu , as discussed above .",
    "the [ f / h ] abundance of bobn 1 is comparable to ngc 40 , which has a wr - type central star ( [ wc8 ] ; de marco & barlow 2001 ) .",
    "the strong stellar wind from wr stars may also be important for the f injection . in bobn 1 , strong and narrow c  iii ,",
    "c  iv , and n  iii lines have been detected ( otsuka 2007 ) , suggesting that the central star is a wels ( weak emission - line star ) known as a class of h - deficient stars .",
    "the central star might have suffered a very late thermal pulse ( vltp ) and become h - deficient .",
    "zijlstra et al .",
    "( 2006 ) noted that the ne enhancement of bobn 1 could be caused by vltp .",
    "the strong stellar wind and vltp might contribute to the enhancements of f , c , and ne in the nebula .",
    "the [ f / h ] abundance of bobn 1 is compatible with the final [ f / h ] predicted by the agb single star models of karakas & lattanzio ( 2007 ) and lugaro et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for initial masses of @xmath32 m@xmath4 stars with _ z _ = 10@xmath51 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath52 @xmath12.3 ) .",

    "such a star , however , would not have survived in the galactic halo up to now .    to circumvent this issue ,",
    "bobn 1 might have evolved from a binary and have experienced binary mass transfer from a massive companion .",
    "the abundances of bobn 1 are comparable to those of he 1305 and other cemp stars as shown in the diagrams of [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] ( figure [ cfe ] ) .",
    "as currently defined , cemp stars fall into two categories , those that exhibit large enhancements of _ s_-process elements ( cemp-_s _ ) and those that do not ( cemp-_no _ ) ( aoki et al . 2007 ) .",
    "most cemp-_s _ stars show large enhancements of c and n abundances .",
    "the evolution models for cemp stars of lau et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have demonstrated that the c and n overabundances would be reproduced by binary interactions .",
    "in fact , about 70@xmath54 of cemp stars are identified as long - period ( 0.3100 yr ) binaries ( beers & christlieb 2005 ) .",
    "schuler et al . (",
    "2007 ) concluded that he 1305 might have experienced mass transfer and predicted that _",

    "= 10@xmath51 and the enhanced c and f are explained by binary mass transfer from the primary star via roche lobe overflow and/or wind accretion .",
    "bobn 1 might also have evolved from a binary consisting of @xmath32 m@xmath4 and @xmath30.8 m@xmath4 stars , since its c and f abundances and metallicity are comparable to he 1305 . the enhanced c and f of bobn 1 can be explained by the model of lugaro et al .",
    "( 2008 ) including the extra @xmath46c and @xmath38n , or the upper limit of the @xmath41f(@xmath39,_p_)@xmath55ne reaction .",
    "the chemical similarities between bobn 1 and cemp-_s _ stars suggest that this pn shares a similar origin and evolutionary history , although we have not detected any _",
    "s_-process elements in this object .",
    "the contradiction on the evolutionary time scale of this object can be avoided if bobn 1 has indeed evolved from a cemp-_s _ star such as he 1305 .",
    "abundances of _ s_-process elements and f should be enhanced in k 648 , h 4 - 1 , and bobn 1 , if they have evolved from cemp-_s _ stars . for k 648 and h 4 - 1 ,",
    "there have been no reports on the detection of f and _ s_-process elements .",
    "high sensitivity spectroscopic observations are necessary in the optical and near - infrared to investigate those elements .",
    "we would be able to settle the origin and evolution of halo pne , if we find enhanced abundances for those elements .",
