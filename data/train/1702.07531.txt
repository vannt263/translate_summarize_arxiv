    "_ electrical impedance tomography _ ( eit ) is an intensively studied research topic because it is a fruitful mathematical problem and has also applications in medical imaging and non - destructive testing .",
    "see @xcite for overviews of eit .",
    "to summarize , the goal of eit is to form an image of the conductivity distribution inside a physical body by using electric measurements on its boundary .",
    "this corresponds to a nonlinear , ill - posed inverse problem , which needs to be tackled by some regularized algorithm or by resorting to bayesian inference . in this work ,",
    "we use the _ d - bar method _ , which is an example of a direct reconstruction algorithm that assumes the knowledge of the idealized boundary measurements ,  i.e. ,  the _ dirichlet - to - neumann _ ( d - to - n ) map . to be more precise",
    ", the d - to - n map is linked to the unknown conductivity by equations found by investigating the inverse problem analytically .",
    "the d - to - n map is a theoretical object representing all possible potential - to - current measurements on the boundary of the domain of interest .",
    "alternatively , one may consider the _ neumann - to - dirichlet _",
    "( n - to - d ) map , broadly speaking the inverse of d - to - n map , which sends the applied boundary current to the measured boundary potential .",
    "the n - to - d map is arguably the better way to model real measurements : it is smoothening and thus easier to handle numerically , and the approximative connection between real - world electrode measurements and the n - to - d map has also been analyzed  @xcite . in particular , the boundary condition between the employed electrodes is in practice _ always _ of the homogeneous neumann type , which obviously favors the use of the n - to - d map ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . due to these reasons",
    ", we simulate all boundary measurements employed in this paper by computing ( suitably truncated versions of ) the n - to - d maps for the considered target configurations , and subsequently form the needed ( relative ) d - to - n maps only when applying the d - bar method to reconstructing conductivities in the _",
    "unit disk_. such an approach is enabled in two spatial dimensions by the use of conformal mappings as explained in what follows .    in this paper , we consider eit in two - dimensional simply connected domains ; observe that such considerations do have practical relevance since a two - dimensional model can be utilized if the imaged three - dimensional object is cylindrically symmetric with homogeneous neumann conditions at the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "the original imaging problem is transformed to the unit disk with the help of a suitable conformal map  by doing so , we enable the use of our direct reconstruction method in the simplest possible setting .",
    "furthermore , in the unit disk we may use mbius transforms to ` magnify ' a _ region of interest _",
    "( roi ) . both of these steps are implemented by modifying the applied boundary current densities so that they account for the stretching introduced by the conformal maps and correspond to the standard ( truncated ) fourier boundary current basis for the unit disk where the d - bar algorithm is implemented .",
    "we call the transformed domain and conductivity the _ virtual domain _ and _ virtual conductivity _ , respectively , as opposed to the _ true domain _ and _ true conductivity _ that correspond to the actual measurements . as demonstrated by our numerical experiments , forming the reconstruction in the virtual domain results in an improved outcome inside the roi",
    ".    magnifying the roi by a mbius transform is motivated by practical measurement set - ups where the number of available electrodes is restricted , but their positions can be freely chosen : if the electrodes are placed equiangledly on the boundary of the unit disk , their number , loosely speaking , restricts the number of fourier modes that can be used as input current densities ( see  @xcite and appendix  [ sec : point ] ) .",
    "similarly , if one wants to get more accurate information about a certain roi inside the imaged object , the pattern of electrodes should arguably be the densest on the boundary section closest to the roi , enabling the use of current patterns with higher spatial frequencies there .",
    "the magnification by a mbius transform can thus be thought of as mapping a nonuniform electrode pattern designed for accurate imaging of the roi onto an equiangled pattern that facilitates a straightforward reconstruction by the d - bar method in the unit disk .",
    "we give further evidence for this interpretation by presenting theoretical results on the possibility of approximating a given ( continuum ) current density by electrode measurements modeled by the _ point electrode model _  ( pem )  @xcite .",
    "this would also straightforwardly lead to similar results for the _ complete electrode model _  ( cem )",
    "@xcite with small electrodes .    on a general level ,",
    "the idea of using conformal mappings in eit - related considerations is definitely not new : in @xcite the mbius transforms between disks and the half - plane were already presented in the discussion of _ visibilities _ and _ sensitivities _ of computed tomography .",
    "this discussion continued as a question of _ distinguishability _ for eit in @xcite , using again conformal mappings in @xcite . following the ideas presented in @xcite , it was recently demonstrated in @xcite that the cem is approximately conformally invariant ( with constant contact resistances ) .",
    "mbius transforms have also been employed in the implementation of the so - called _ convex source support _",
    "algorithm for detecting anomalies from a single measurement pair of eit both in a bounded domain  @xcite and in a half - plane  @xcite .",
    "this paper uses the same transformation properties of conformal maps as the aforementioned articles , but we also introduce and numerically test the concept of virtual domain with the help of the _ conformally transformed truncated fourier basis _ introduced in @xcite .",
    "in particular , to the authors best knowledge , this work presents the first d - bar reconstructions in a half - space geometry .",
    "implementing a numerical method for computing conformal maps between planar domains is outside the scope of this manuscript .",
    "therefore , we employ the _ schwarz  christoffel toolbox _",
    "@xcite in matlab to compute numerical conformal maps and their derivatives between the unit disk and arbitrary polygons  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "mbius transforms and their derivatives are trivial to implement numerically .",
    "this text is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : setting ] , we introduce our mathematical framework .",
    "the main ideas of the d - bar method are recalled in section  [ sec : dbar ] , with special emphasis on its numerical implementation ( in the unit disk ) .",

    "it follows from the standard theory of elliptic boundary value problems that @xmath8 is bounded .",
    "the caldern problem is to determine @xmath18 from the knowledge of @xmath8 .",
    "as explained above , in this work we assume to be able to measure ( an approximation of ) the n - to - d map @xmath19 instead of the d - to - n map .",

    "the d - bar method originates from the work of ablowitz , nachman , beals and coifman @xcite in a related inverse scattering problem .",
    "it is based on a _ non - linear fourier transform _",

    "( cgo ) solutions of faddeev @xcite are used .",

    "the two - dimensional caldern problem was solved ,  i.e. ,  its uniqueness was deduced , using the d - bar method by nachman @xcite for conductivities in @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the solution technique was later generalized by brown and uhlmann @xcite for less regular conductivities . using d - bar techniques and quasiconformal maps ,",
    "the two - dimensional caldern problem was finally completely solved by astala and pivrinta @xcite for @xmath33 .",
    "the ideas of exploiting conformal transformations presented in this manuscript are arguably as useful for any of the aforementioned variants of the d - bar method and , more generally , for any reconstruction method where the d - to - n or n - to - d map is approximated by a matrix in a truncated fourier basis .",
    "however , we will only numerically test these ideas using nachman s original method .",
    "the origin of the d - bar method lies with the direct solution to a certain inverse scattering problem formulated as the _ gelfand  caldern _ ( gc ) problem @xcite : by writing @xmath34 , is transformed into a zero - energy schrdinger equation @xmath35 which necessitates the smoothness assumption @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , the equations governing _ diffuse optical tomography _ ( dot ) and _ acoustic tomography _ ( at ) can be recast in the form but with negative and positive energies  @xcite , respectively .",
    "we remark what the method of astala and pivrinta  @xcite does not require transforming the conductivity equation into the form , and in theory it thus works with more general conductivities @xmath37 .",
    "however , a number of numerical results indicate that nachman s method remains functional even for discontinuous conductivities or if the smoothness assumptions are violated in some other way  @xcite .",
    "_ complex geometrical optics _ ( cgo ) solutions @xmath38 are exponentially behaving solutions to the schrdinger equation .",
