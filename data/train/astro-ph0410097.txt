    "with the recent results from the degree angular scale interferometer ( dasi ; @xcite ) , the cosmic anisotropy mapper ( capmap ; @xcite ) and the cosmic background imager ( cbi ; @xcite ) , and the imminent two - year results from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ; @xcite ) , the characterization of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization is gathering pace .",
    "the ultimate goal of such experiments is to constrain parameters describing the cosmological model and its fluctuations , and hence test models for the generation of these fluctuations , such as inflation . in gaussian theories ,",
    "all of the cosmological information encoded in the cmb anisotropies and their polarization is contained in their power spectra .",
    "for this reason , estimating cmb power spectra is a useful and efficient form of data compression in analysis pipelines  @xcite .",
    "however , estimating the spectra is not enough : it is also essential to have an accurate covariance matrix , and preferably an accurate model for the shape of the likelihood function ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "modelling the covariance matrix for a particularly efficient class of polarization power spectra estimators  heuristically - weighted quadratic estimators , or pseudo-@xmath0s  is the subject of this paper .",
    "the polarization field can be decomposed uniquely on the full sky into a gradient part , with electric ( @xmath1 ) parity , and a curl part with magnetic ( @xmath2 ) parity  @xcite .",
    "the cosmological importance of this decomposition is that linear density perturbations can not produce magnetic polarization , and so , in standard scenarios and at linear order , large - angle @xmath2-mode polarization is produced solely by gravitational waves .",
    "second - order effects , most notably weak gravitational lensing by large - scale structure , can generate @xmath2 modes from primary @xmath1 modes  @xcite .",
    "the lens - induced @xmath2 modes have a blue spectrum , and should dominate any primary signal from gravitational waves on sub - degree scales . on larger scales , they may still dominate if the gravitational wave amplitude is sufficiently low .",
    "either way , the variance of the @xmath2 modes is expected to be much smaller than that of the @xmath1 modes . given the different parity properties of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 fields , cmb polarization in a statistically - isotropic and parity - respecting universe is characterized by two power spectra , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and also the cross - power @xmath6 between @xmath1 and the temperature anisotropies .",
    "a number of different methods have been developed to estimate these cmb polarization power spectra .",
    "the optimal method , brute - force maximum likelihood ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and its quadratic approximation  @xcite , should produce the most accurate ( minimum - variance ) estimates .",
    "however , these methods require the inversion of @xmath7 matrices , where @xmath8 is the number of pixels in the map , which is prohibitively slow for the analysis of mega - pixel maps . given these limitations , a number of fast alternative methods have been suggested  @xcite building on earlier work on the analysis of the temperature anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "these fast methods are closely related , and all involve compressing heuristically - weighted maps of the stokes parameters into a set of pseudo-@xmath0s making use of spherical transforms  a step that requires only @xmath9 operations with fast fourier transform methods on iso - latitude pixelisations such as the widely - used healpix  @xcite .",
    "the methods differ in the details of how they transform the pseudo-@xmath0s to power spectrum estimates . in the absence of instrument noise ,",
    "the mean of the pseudo-@xmath0s is linear in the true power spectra , so , for observations over a large enough part of the sky , unbiased power spectrum estimates can be obtained by applying the inverse operation to the pseudo-@xmath0s  @xcite . if the observed part of the sky is sufficiently small , direct inversion is not possible and some form of regularisation is required .",
    "@xcite advocate using likelihood methods , while  @xcite make use of correlation functions as an intermediate data product",
    ". a notable feature of the latter approach is that the inversion is constructed so that electric and magnetic polarization power is not mixed in the mean .",
    "pseudo-@xmath0 methods have now been applied to a number of real data sets , both for temperature  @xcite and polarization analyses  @xcite .    despite the attention that pseudo-@xmath0 techniques have received , relatively little",
    "work has been done on trying to _ understand _ their error properties .",
    "this paper aims to fill that gap by providing the basis for a reliable , semi - analytic error analysis technique for cmb polarization power spectrum estimates obtained with pseudo-@xmath0 methods .",
    "this extends earlier analytic work that discusses temperature anisotropies only  @xcite , and the recent thesis work by one of us  @xcite where both temperature and polarization are considered .",
    "a significant complication that arises for polarized data is the mixing of @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes for observations covering only part of the sky  @xcite . we develop approximations to the pseudo-@xmath0 sample covariances , taking this mixing into account at leading order for maps with smoothly - apodized edges .",
    "our approximations are accurate in the regime where the mixing is perturbative , i.e.  for @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the effective band - limit of the function used to weight the stokes parameters .",
    "it is difficult to construct good approximations for the covariance on large scales , @xmath12 .",
    "this is partly because of the increased importance of @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing there , but also because the polarization power spectra do not go smoothly to zero on large scales in the presence of reionization .",
    "( the behaviour of the temperature - anisotropy power spectrum on large scales produces a similar effect for the temperature pseudo-@xmath0 covariance . )",
    "following  @xcite , the low-@xmath13 sector of the covariance matrices can be constructed directly with exact methods , and used to overwrite the inaccurate approximation .",
    "being able to evaluate accurate covariances efficiently is important in any application where multiple evaluations are required .",
    "examples include parameter estimation , where the covariance generally depends on position in parameter space , and optimising the design and analysis of surveys , where one might wish to assess a large number of weighting schemes .    throughout , we ignore the effects of instrument noise so we deal only with the sample covariance of the @xmath14 .",
    "this is to highlight the geometric effects of heuristic weighting that are peculiar to polarization analysis , particularly @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing .",
    "an obvious extension of this work that will be required for application to real data is to include the contribution from instrument noise .",
    "for uncorrelated noise this should be straightforward , but in a more realistic set - up , one will probably have to resort to monte - carlo simulations for the noise contribution .    as noted above ,",
    "one of the future goals of cmb polarization observations is to detect ( or constrain ) the stochastic gravitational wave background via its signature in large - angle @xmath2-mode polarization  @xcite .",
    "magnetic polarization allows much smaller amplitude gravitational wave backgrounds to be detected than with temperature or electric polarization alone , since , in the latter case , the gravitational - wave signal is swamped by the cosmic variance of the signal from the dominant density perturbations . methods to separate out exactly pure magnetic modes from observations with incomplete sky coverage exist at the map level  @xcite .",
    "such methods have the desirable property that quadratic power spectrum estimates formed from the pure-@xmath2 modes have no cosmic variance if the @xmath2-mode power is zero . were it not for gravitational lensing , separating @xmath2 modes at the level of the map would thus allow the detection of arbitrarily low amplitude gravitational wave backgrounds in the absence of instrument noise . in practice ,",
    "imperfections in removing the lensing signal limit the amplitude to tensor - to - scalar ratios @xmath15 ( @xcite ; see  @xcite for refinements from more optimal lensing - reconstruction methods ) .",
    "heuristically - weighted pseudo-@xmath0 methods do not share the property that the cosmic variance of the estimated @xmath5 is immune to @xmath1-mode power , even if we take care to construct unbiased estimates so that e.g.the mean of our @xmath5 estimator decouples from @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "we investigate this issue further here , exploring the limits of detectability for @xmath16 that arise solely from cosmic variance of the @xmath1-mode polarization leaking into the variance of quadratic estimates of @xmath5 .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : properties ] reviews the properties of the polarization pseudo-@xmath0s and establishes our notation . following a brief discussion of the exact pseudo-@xmath0 covariance matrices in section  [ sec : exact - cov ] ,",
    "we develop analytic approximations to them that can be rapidly computed in section  [ sec : approx - cov ] .",
    "we begin with a toy model , based on a gaussian weight function applied to a small survey area in the flat - sky limit .",
    "( some of the more involved manipulations are relegated to appendix  [ app : flat ] . )",
    "this instructive example illustrates the key issues that are specific to the analysis of polarization , i.e.  the geometric mixing of @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes .",
    "we then move on to develop approximations for arbitrary ( smooth ) weight functions , and test these against the exact covariances in cases where we can easily compute the latter ( in particular , for azimuthally - symmetric weight functions ) .",
    "simple rules - of - thumb for band - power variances are also derived in section  [ subsec : rot ] as limiting cases of the more general expressions ; some of the manipulations of the @xmath17 symbols required for these derivations are relegated to appendix  [ app : useful_sums ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : implications ] we consider the implications of our results for the detection of gravitational waves with @xmath2-mode polarization estimated with pseudo-@xmath0 methods .    throughout",
    ", we illustrate our results with the best - fitting power - law concordance @xmath18cdm model to the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( _ wmap _ ) and 2df galaxy redshift survey data ( @xcite ; table 7 ) , but with the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath19 corresponding to @xmath20 inflation .",
    "we include the effects of gravitational lensing in the @xmath2-mode power spectrum , but ignore effects due to its non - gaussianity .",
    "theoretical power spectra , pseudo-@xmath0s and estimated power spectra in all figures include the smoothing effect of a gaussian beam of ten - arcmin fwhm .",
    "we define stokes parameters along the line of sight @xmath21 using the basis vectors of a spherical polar coordinate system .",
    "we take the local @xmath22 axis to be @xmath23 and the @xmath24 axis @xmath25 ; these form a right - handed triad with the radiation propagation direction @xmath26 which defines the local @xmath27 axis .",
    "the complex polarization @xmath28 is then spin -2  @xcite and can properly be expanded in terms of spin-2 spherical harmonics ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) : @xmath29 reality of the stokes parameters ensures that @xmath30 and similarly for @xmath31 , while under parity transformations @xmath32 ( electric parity ) but @xmath33 ( magnetic parity ) .",
    "the polarization power spectra are defined in statistically - isotropic and parity - respecting models by @xmath34 the @xmath1-@xmath2 power vanishes ( and @xmath2 is uncorrelated with the temperature anisotropies ) by parity .    in pseudo-@xmath0 methods",
    ", one adopts a heuristic weighting of the complex polarization with a scalar function @xmath35 .",
    "the weight is necessarily zero in those regions that are not observed , but typically it is desirable to excise a larger region to remove further regions of high foreground emission .",
    "one can attempt to choose @xmath35 to improve the accuracy of subsequent power spectrum estimates .",
    "for example , on small scales , where the instrument noise dominates the signal , the optimal weighting is essentially inverse - noise - variance weighting  @xcite , while on large scales uniform weighting is preferable . in this paper",
    "we shall assume that the weight is chosen to be real and to go smoothly to zero as excised regions are approached .",
    "the former restriction ensures that the weighting does not alter the polarization direction , while the latter makes @xmath35 approximately band - limited to some @xmath11 .",
    "such edge apodization allows us to deal with the effects of the resulting @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing in the pseudo-@xmath0 covariance matrices in a perturbative manner ; see section  [ sec : approx - cov ] .",
    "the problem of @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing without edge apodization , i.e.  taking @xmath35 everywhere one or zero , is discussed extensively by  @xcite and  @xcite in the context of isolating @xmath2 modes at the map level .    following  @xcite",
    ", we define pseudo - multipoles @xmath36 and @xmath37 to be the @xmath1 and @xmath2-mode multipoles of the weighted polarization map , so that @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the hermitian coupling matrices @xmath40 using @xmath41 , and the reality of @xmath35 , we have @xmath42 which ensures that @xmath43 and a similar result for @xmath37 . if we expand the weight function in terms of its spherical multipoles , @xmath44 , the coupling matrices can be evaluated in terms of wigner-@xmath17 symbols : @xmath45 from equation  ( [ eq:5 - 25 ] ) we can separate the @xmath1 and @xmath2 pseudo - multipoles as @xmath46 where we define the hermitian @xmath47 to be @xmath48 given the @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we form their pseudo-@xmath0s according to @xmath49 we could also form @xmath50 , but , as we show shortly , this vanishes in the mean in the absence of parity violations .",
    "however , it may provide a useful test on parity - violating physics or unaccounted - for systematics , and so future data should , of course , be validated with @xmath51 .    in the absence of instrument noise , the mean pseudo-@xmath0s ( i.e.averaged over cmb realisations )",
    "are related to the true power spectra by convolutions .",

    "the sum of @xmath63 and @xmath56 is approximately equal to the matrix that relates the temperature @xmath0s to the mean pseudo-@xmath0s  @xcite at high @xmath13 .",
    "their sum differs from the temperature case only by the presence of non - zero azimuthal quantum numbers @xmath64 in the @xmath17 symbol .",

    "this additional contribution to @xmath76 from geometric mixing of @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : power_and_window ] , and , as expected , looks like a scaled version of the @xmath1-mode power spectrum .",

    "equation  ( [ eq:5 - 35a ] ) follows from the expansions of @xmath63 and @xmath56 in equations  ( [ eq:11 ] ) and  ( [ eq:12 ] ) , and the orthogonality of the @xmath17 symbols . it is the same normalisation as for the temperature anisotropies . equation  ( [ eq:5 - 35 ] ) can be established following the method used to derive equation ( 66 ) in  @xcite ; see also appendix  [ app : useful_sums ] .",
    "note that for @xmath13 much greater than the assumed band - limit of @xmath35 , the normalisation @xmath83 is suppressed by a factor @xmath84 compared to @xmath85 .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing is suppressed at high @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "we can gain further insight into this result by noting that [ for smooth @xmath35 ] @xmath87 where @xmath88 is @xmath35 smoothed with a top - hat ( @xmath13-space ) filter .",
    "for band - limited weight functions , at @xmath10 the smoothing has little effect and so to leading order @xmath89 at a given scale @xmath13 , the relative importance of mixing of @xmath1- and @xmath2-mode power in the pseudo-@xmath0s is thus controlled by @xmath90 times the ratio of the average squared gradient of the weight function to the average square weight function .",
    "for the purpose of parameter estimation , it is not strictly necessary to attempt to invert the pseudo-@xmath0s to ( unbiased ) power spectrum estimates .",
    "forming the pseudo-@xmath0s can be regarded as a mildly - lossy form of data compression of the maps of stokes parameters , and inferences about cosmological models can be made directly from them if their covariance  or , better , their full sampling distribution  can be calculated  @xcite . the calculation of the signal contribution to these covariances is the main topic of this paper .",
    "however , for presentation purposes it is useful to be able to plot quantities that are simply related to the underlying power spectra . at",

    "] , the matrices @xmath63 and @xmath56 will be invertible . in this case",
    "we easily obtain unbiased estimates of @xmath4 and @xmath5 from @xmath92 alternatively , we can form unbiased estimates of the correlation functions of the stokes parameters from the polarization pseudo-@xmath0s ( or directly from the maps ) , and then invert these with the appropriate legendre transforms  @xcite . for observations over smaller parts of the sky ,",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath56 will not be invertible . in this case we do not have the spectral resolution to obtain unbiased estimates of the @xmath0s at every @xmath13 .",
    "various approaches have been suggested to regularise the inversion including the use of band - powers  @xcite , or apodized legendre transforms of the ( incomplete ) correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "the latter method provides estimates of the @xmath0s convolved with a window function that depends only on the choice of apodizing function that is applied to the correlation function .",
    "@xcite , building on earlier work by  @xcite , showed how to generalise the correlation function method to ensure that the estimated polarization power spectra did not mix @xmath1 and @xmath2 power in the mean .",
    "this is particularly useful for visualisation of the @xmath2-mode power spectrum which can easily be swamped by the dominant @xmath1 modes .",
    "we do not reproduce the method of  @xcite here , but note only that it provides a convenient way of constructing pseudo - inverses @xmath93 and @xmath94 to @xmath63 and @xmath56 respectively with the properties that @xmath95 these relations ensure that our estimates of the power spectra , @xmath96 satisfy @xmath97 and the equivalent relation for @xmath5 .",
    "the normalised window function @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is given by  @xcite @xmath100 here , @xmath101 are the reduced wigner rotation matrices and @xmath102 is the apodizing function that is applied to the correlation functions .",
    "an example of the pseudo - inverses obtained via this route is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : power_and_window ] , along with the mean of the recovered @xmath0s .",
    "the correlation functions have been apodized with a gaussian with hwhm of @xmath103 .",
    "the apodizing function was deliberately chosen to be narrow to ensure that the resulting pseudo - inverses @xmath93 and @xmath94 are well localised .",
    "given that the pseudo - inverses are significantly broader than @xmath63 and @xmath56 , the window function @xmath99 ( not shown in the figure ) inherits the width of the pseudo - inverses .",
    "for this reason the spectral resolution of the recovered @xmath0s is rather poor compared to what should ultimately be achievable for a @xmath67-radius survey .",
    "the effect of this is that the recovered @xmath0s accurately follow the true @xmath0s only for @xmath104 .",
    "the covariance of any quadratic power spectrum estimates that derive from the pseudo-@xmath0s by linear transformations follow simply from the covariance of the latter .",
    "for this reason , in this paper we concentrate on the pseudo-@xmath0 covariance .",
    "furthermore , we focus on the sample covariance ( i.e.  we neglect instrument noise ) to highlight those aspects specific to cmb polarization that arise from mode - mixing on the incomplete sky . including instrument noise is obviously important for application to near - future surveys since it will dominate sample variance .",
    "extending the analytic results derived in this paper to include simple white noise should be straightforward ( see  @xcite for the case of the temperature anisotropies ) .",
    "however , for more realistic correlated noise , monte - carlo simulations will probably be required to account properly for the noise contribution to the covariances .",
    "we shall assume throughout that the cmb signal is gaussian .",
    "if the initial fluctuations were very - nearly gaussian , as expected in simple single - field inflation models ( e.g.  @xcite ) , non - linear effects will introduce only a small level of non - gaussianity into @xmath1 modes on the scales of interest for primary cmb science ( e.g.  @xcite ) . however , if the primordial tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath105 , then the dominant power in @xmath2 modes is expected to come from gravitational - lensing conversion of gaussian @xmath1 modes into non - gaussian @xmath2 modes . in this limit , our assumption of gaussianity will be violated and the expressions derived in this paper will require some modification to account for the non - zero connected four - point function . while a full treatment of the pseudo-@xmath0 covariance in the presence of lens - induced @xmath2 modes is beyond the scope of the current paper , we note that the lensing contribution to @xmath106 has been calculated recently for uniform weighting in the flat - sky limit  @xcite .    in this section",
    "we calculate the exact sample covariance of @xmath74 and @xmath57 ( see also  @xcite for a similar calculation ) and present the results of numerical computations for two types of survey : a full - sky survey with a simple galactic cut , and a @xmath67-radius circular survey of the type that is optimal for gravitational wave searches in the presence of instrument noise at the level achievable with current technology  @xcite .    for gaussian cmb fields , the pseudo - multipoles are also gaussian ,",
    "so the covariance of their power spectra are given by e.g.@xmath107 if we expand the pseudo - multipoles in terms of the true multipoles using equation  ( [ eq:5 - 25 ] ) , we find @xmath108 evaluating these expressions numerically is straightforward in principle , but is computationally expensive , with an operation count of @xmath109 if multipoles up to @xmath13 are retained .",
    "this is prohibitive for @xmath13 above a few hundred , and so , in general , there is a need for faster approximate calculations .",
    "one such approximation is to compute the covariances from monte - carlo simulations ; this has the benefit of allowing one easily to include a number of real - world effects that are more difficult to include in the analytic calculation .",
    "an alternative , which is developed here in section  [ sec : approx - cov ] , is to use analytic approximations ( that can be calibrated with simulations if required ) . as we show later , it is difficult to find good analytic approximations at low @xmath13 because of the expected sharp rise in the polarization @xmath0s there , and the increased importance of @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing .",
    "a similar problem arises for the temperature anisotropies because the @xmath0s do not go smoothly to zero as @xmath110 .",

    "first , we set @xmath128 so that we obtain the error in the recovered @xmath5 due to sample variance of the lensing @xmath2 modes .",
    "these errors are representative of what would be achieved if we were able to separate @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes perfectly , and without loss , on all scales in the maps ; they agree very well with the rule of thumb in equation  ( [ eq : rot8 ] ) if we swap the roles of @xmath1 and @xmath2 there .",
    "we also calculate the band - power errors obtained by setting @xmath183 , i.e.  removing the @xmath2-mode power from lensing ; they agree reasonably with the rule of thumb in equation  ( [ eq : rot9 ] ) .",
    "these errors arise because , in any realisation , our chosen estimator @xmath210 receives a contribution from both @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes , despite only coupling to @xmath2-mode power in the mean .",
    "such errors can only be removed by isolating @xmath2 modes at the level of the map , or by adopting more optimal , non - local weighting of the data , as in maximum - likelihood power spectrum estimation .",
    "critically , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : errors_on_recovered_b ] that the errors due to the sample variance of the @xmath1 modes that leak into the estimator dominate the sample variance from lensing @xmath2 modes on large scales , where the gravitational - wave signal resides .",
    "we conclude from the figure that pseudo-@xmath0 estimators will be highly non - optimal for future experiments with thermal sensitivity better than @xmath379-arcmin , targeting @xmath2-mode polarization over a few - hundred square degrees .-",
    "mode polarization with a power spectrum of known shape but ( low ) unknown amplitude is a circle of radius around 10 degrees  @xcite .",
    "this assumes that the sample variance of the @xmath2 modes from gravitational waves does not dominate the error budget .",
    "if the lens - induced @xmath2 modes are treated as an additional ( gaussian ) noise term , the optimal survey area is increased since sample variance becomes an issue again .",
    "the best compromise is roughly to balance the sample variance of the lens - induced @xmath2 modes with the thermal - noise variance . as a specific example , for 200 _ pairs _ of polarization - sensitive bolometers , with each bolometer having sensitivity @xmath380 , and one year of integration , a survey covering two per cent of the sky balances the thermal and sample variance . ]",
    "we can make a quantitative estimate of the impact of the additional sample variance due to leaked @xmath1 modes on the detectability of gravitational waves as follows . to preserve all information in the pseudo-@xmath0s , we bypass the step of forming unbiased estimates of @xmath5 [ which involves the singular transformation in equation  ( [ eq : estimates ] ) ] , and instead estimate @xmath16 directly from the pseudo-@xmath0s .",
    "we concatenate @xmath74 and @xmath57 into a single data vector @xmath14 , whose covariance matrix @xmath381 then consists of blocks formed from @xmath116 , @xmath127 and @xmath122 .",
    "we assume that all parameters except @xmath16 are fixed , and calculate its one - sigma fisher error from @xmath382 in practice , we invert the covariance matrix with a singular - value decomposition which projects out any linear dependencies in the @xmath14 due to the finite sky coverage . for the @xmath67-radius survey , the one - sigma error on @xmath16 in the null hypothesis ( @xmath376 )",
    "is @xmath383 .",
    "our sensitivity to @xmath16 improves dramatically to @xmath384 if we artificially set @xmath128 ( and @xmath385 ) in the analysis .",
    "this latter case is representative of what could be achieved with lossless separation of the @xmath2 modes , followed by a pseudo-@xmath0 analysis of the stokes maps of these @xmath2 modes . in practice , @xmath1-@xmath2 separation is lossy , particularly on the largest scales where there is significant @xmath2-mode power from reionization  @xcite .",
    "if we assume , crudely , that large - scale modes with @xmath386 are lost to the separation , we find a @xmath387 for the @xmath67-radius survey .",
    "the effect of not isolating the @xmath2 modes properly in the pseudo-@xmath0 analysis thus degrades the limit on @xmath16 by a factor @xmath388 .",
    "accurate calculation of the covariance matrix is an important part of power spectrum estimation during the analysis of cmb data .",
    "a ` correct ' estimator ( i.e.  unbiased ) , but with poorly quantified errors , is useless for subsequent parameter estimation . in this paper",
    "we have constructed the contribution from sample variance to the covariance matrices of heuristically - weighted quadratic estimates of the cmb polarization power spectra .",
    "exact calculation of these matrices for general weighting is numerically feasible at large scales ( @xmath13 less than a hundred or so ) , but the @xmath109 scaling is prohibitive on small scales . to resolve this problem we developed analytic approximations to the polarization covariance matrices , including the effects of mode coupling and , in a perturbative manner , the mixing of @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes that inevitably arises with heuristic weighting .",
    "our approximations , which generalise earlier work on the temperature anisotropies  @xcite , can be computed efficiently to high @xmath13 .",
    "accurate covariance matrices can be obtained on all scales by replacing the low-@xmath13 sectors of our approximations with a numerical calculation .",
    "we tested the approximations against numerical results for two toy - model surveys for which azimuthal symmetry allows efficient evaluation of the exact covariances .",
    "for the more challenging survey , a @xmath67-radius survey with cosine - squared apodization of the outer @xmath69 , the most significant errors were on the variance of @xmath57 .",
    "these errors arise from our local treatment of the @xmath1-mode power spectrum when it appears in a convolution with the broad kernel that describes the mixing of @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes in equation  ( [ eq:5 - 38 ] ) . for the variance of @xmath74 ( and the temperature anisotropies )",
    "the approximation is more accurate because the dominant convolution involves a kernel that is intrinsically more narrow .",
    "it will probably be very difficult to improve the error on the variance of @xmath57 in an analytic treatment .",
    "fortunately , convolution errors tend to cancel in the approximation of the _ correlation _ matrices .",
    "we observed maximum errors @xmath389 in the correlations , except on the largest scales , suggesting that , in a practical application , it should be possible to construct accurate covariance matrices by combining the approximate correlations with variances calibrated off simulations . by binning our approximate covariances",
    ", we also derived useful rules of thumb for the variances of band - power estimates of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "these are particularly simple to evaluate , involving only integrals of products of the weight function and its derivatives .",
    "a further aim of this paper was to quantify the conditions under which pseudo-@xmath0 methods can be applied to gravitational - wave searches via @xmath2-mode polarization .",
    "measurements of the @xmath2-mode power spectrum from gravitational waves with future surveys with sub-@xmath390-arcmin thermal noise are potentially limited by the sample variance of lens - induced @xmath2 modes .",
    "we showed that for surveys covering one or two per cent of the sky , the additional variance due to leaked @xmath1 modes dominates the lensing noise .",
    "adopting pseudo-@xmath0 methods would therefore by highly sub - optimal : the error on the tensor - to - scalar ratio would be @xmath388 times higher than if @xmath2 modes had been isolated before forming quadratic estimates .",
    "ultimately , this additional variance would limit the tensor - to - scalar ratio that is detectable with pseudo-@xmath0 methods to @xmath3 .",
    "map - level @xmath1-@xmath2 separation , or more optimal weighting such as in maximum - likelihood power spectrum estimation , will therefore be essential to ensure the maximum returns from future @xmath2-mode surveys .",
