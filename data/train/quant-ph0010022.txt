    "one of the most impressive demonstrations of the specifically non - classical features of quantum mechanics is the violation of bell s inequalities by entangled photon pairs @xcite .",
    "the violation of bell s inequalities shows that it is impossible to explain the statistical predictions of quantum theory by assigning a complete set of polarization components to each photon before the measurement .",
    "this implies that the measurement results for a specific polarization direction should not be interpreted as a general property of the photon .",
    "in particular , photons can not be classified as either x or y polarized , even though only these two outcomes are observed in precise polarization measurements along these axes .    in the following ,",
    "the non - classical correlations of entangled photons are analyzed by applying finite resolution measurements @xcite .",
    "a measurement setup for the simultaneous measurement of non - commuting polarization components is presented in section [ sec : onephoton ] . in section [ sec : twophotons ] , this measurement concept is applied to entangled photon pairs .",
    "it is shown how information on all four polarization components responsible for the violation of bell s inequalities can be obtained from a single measurement setup .",
    "the analysis of the measurement statistics shows that the violation of bell s inequalities arises from negative joint probabilities similar to the ones obtained in the single photon measurement setup .",
    "the statistics derived from the finite resolution measurement thus allows an identification of the local non - classical properties responsible for the violation of bell s inequalities .",
    "the polarization of light can be characterized by the stokes parameters , defined as the intensity difference between orthogonally polarized modes .",
    "a complete description of polarization requires three stokes parameters .",
    "all stokes parameters can then be written as components of this three dimensional vector . in terms of the annihilation operators for right and left circular polarization , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the stokes parameters read @xmath2 for a single photon , these operators have eigenvalues of @xmath3 , as observed in measurements using polarization filters",
    ". however , a polarization filter is only sensitive to one component of the stokes vector at a time , while completely randomizing the information potentially carried by the other two components .",
    "this limitation can be overcome by applying finite resolution measurements to obtain information on one polarization component while limiting the noise introduced in the other components .",
    "it is then possible to study correlations between the non - commuting polarization components of a single photon .",
