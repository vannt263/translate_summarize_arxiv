    "polymers and polymer solutions belong to the most intensively studied objects in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "the adsorption of polymers on surfaces and interfaces is of special importance @xcite .",
    "adsorption of free polymers in solution on the container wall or other boundaries occurs in the presence of attractive interactions between the surface and the chain monomers .",
    "examples of such interactions include coulomb and van der waals forces , and more specific molecular interactions .",
    "coulomb forces are screened by counter - ions in the solution and can be tuned to some extent by adding salt to the solvent . thus on changing the properties of the solvent",
    "an individual polymer chain can undergo a reversible transition from a freely floating , desorbed state to an adsorbed state in which the chain monomers are close to the surface on average .",
    "the adsorption of polymers on flat surfaces has been studied theoretically and experimentally , and is by now well understood @xcite . due to the importance to colloidal dispersions the interaction of polymers with",
    "spherical and rodlike particles has been studied as well @xcite .",
    "the adsorption of flexible polymers on rodlike particles is relevant , for example , in gels @xcite , and for the binding of flexible polymers to relatively stiff biomolecules such as dna @xcite .",
    "another class of polymer adsorption transitions involve two flexible self - avoiding but mutually attracting polymers which can form a bound , double - stranded , so - called `` zipped '' state .",
    "a prominent example of this kind of transition is the denaturation transition of double - stranded dna @xcite which recently attracted considerable attention regarding its statistical - mechanical properties and thermodynamic order @xcite ( for a recent review on the biophysics related to dna topology , see @xcite ) .",
    "the dna denaturation transition is usually modelled in such a way that monomer @xmath1 of one strand can only interact with monomer @xmath1 of the other strand , reflecting the key - lock principle of natural , inhomogeneous dna with its specific sequence of base pairs .",
    "two - chain systems in which any monomer of one chain can interact with any monomer of the other chain include diblock copolymers , which consist of linear chains of @xmath2 monomers of type @xmath3 followed by @xmath4 monomers of type @xmath5 , with different @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 interactions ; systems of this kind have been intensively studied as well @xcite .",
    "recently it was found that self - avoiding mutually attracting diblock copolymers can adopt a zipped state in which the two components form a bound , double - stranded structure which however remains swollen and does not assume compact configurations .",
    "the zipped state is located between a swollen , unbound high - temperature state and a compact low - temperature state , separated by second - order and first - order phase transitions , respectively @xcite .",
    "( 10,8 ) ( -0.5,-30.5 )    in this work we focus on the adsorption transition of a long flexible self - avoiding polymer chain onto a rigid thin elongated rod , as shown in figure [ fig_rod ] .",
    "we assume that the rod is endowed with a short - ranged surface potential , or adsorption energy , @xmath9 , for the chain monomers ; the more positive @xmath9 , the more attractive the interaction .",
    "thus , on increasing @xmath9 from a low value , at some threshold value @xmath10 the chain is expected to undergo a transition from an unbound , free state to a bound state in which the overall gain in binding energy compensates the loss of configurational entropy . an interesting feature of this transition is the fact that it represents a true phase transition in the thermodynamic sense ; the adsorbed state forming an elongated , aligned structure , see figure [ fig_rod ] .",
    "in contrast , for a particle of finite size , a self - avoiding polymer chain can not undergo a true adsorption phase transition due to steric constraints .",
    "the focus of the present work is on the former case . since the polymer adsorption transition is characterized by large fluctuations we expect scaling and universal behaviour .",
    "we thus use the renormalization group to obtain general scaling results for the chain partition function .",
    "we also obtain estimates for relevant critical exponents by geometric arguments . before we introduce and study our model in section [ sec_rod ] we recall some general ideas and concepts for later reference . in section [ subsec_general ]",
    "we discuss typical scaling arguments related to the polymer adsorption transition .",
    "since our work strongly relies on field - theoretical methods , in section [ subsec_map ] and [ sec_app ] we sketch the mapping of the polymer system on the ginzburg - landau model .",

    "for the time being , this object can be a surface , a thin rod , another flexible polymer chain , or any other extended manifold that allows for a thermodynamic adsorption phase transition .",

    "s thermodynamic variables close to the adsorption transition point , only the number of chain monomers @xmath13 and the adsorption energy @xmath14 remain as relevant parameters , where @xmath10 is the adsorption energy at the transition point .",

    "the exponent @xmath17 thus characterizes the scaling of @xmath12 right at the transition point : @xmath22 .",
    "note that @xmath17 is not necessarily equal to the critical exponent @xmath23 for an unbounded , free chain , for which @xmath24 ( compare equation ( [ scalbehz ] ) in section [ subsec_ren ] , with @xmath25 introduced in equation ( [ scalbeh ] ) and @xmath26 ) .",

    "however , within the @xmath227-model the special value @xmath220 is already fixed by scale invariance , whereas in the gaussian model the value @xmath228 is only fixed if one requires conformal invariance .    by solving the rg equation ( [ rg ] ) for the two - point function in the standard way using characteristics and integrating over @xmath82 , one derives the general scaling behaviour of the chain partition function in the grand canonical ensemble : @xmath229 where @xmath230 with @xmath220 from equation ( [ van ] ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath231 is a bulk critical exponent , while @xmath232 ( the crossover exponent ) and @xmath233 are critical exponents associated with a _ flat _",
    "surface @xcite .",
    "the exponent functions @xmath234 for @xmath235 are defined below equation ( [ beta ] ) and in equation ( [ etac ] ) .",
    "the values @xmath236 are the values of the exponent functions at the fixed point @xmath237 .",
    "the constants @xmath238 and @xmath239 in equation ( [ scalbeh ] ) are nonuniversal prefactors , while the function @xmath240 is a universal scaling function .",
    "equation ( [ scalbeh ] ) is in line with the gaussian model ( where @xmath241 and @xmath242 ) : @xmath243 compare equation ( [ suscept ] ) .",
    "finally , equation ( [ scalbeh ] ) can be compared with the corresponding behaviour for a flat surface : @xmath244 note that this limit can be obtained from equation ( [ scalbeh ] ) by rewriting the second scaling argument as @xmath245 .",
    "equation ( [ scalbehplanar ] ) then follows as the limit @xmath246 of the scaling form @xmath247 , where @xmath248 .",
    "let us come back to equation ( [ scalbeh ] ) .",
    "according to recent estimates one has @xmath249 @xcite and @xmath250 @xcite for @xmath251 in @xmath252 so that the exponent @xmath253 in equation ( [ scalbeh ] ) is small but positive . from a naive point of view",
    "this would imply that the scaling variable @xmath254 in the second scaling argument of @xmath255 is _ irrelevant _ and could be omitted from the outset ; however , one should keep in mind that the radius @xmath0 in the first scaling argument is also irrelevant in principle .",
    "now , the relevant question is whether the scaling function @xmath240 exhibits a singularity on a certain subset of @xmath256 , corresponding to the polymer adsorption transition ; compare the related discussion below equation ( [ scalex ] ) and below equation ( [ fracd2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , we expect this singularity to occur for @xmath257 , where now @xmath258 is a function of the first scaling variable @xmath259 .",
    "note that the scaling function @xmath260 in equation ( [ scalbehgauss ] ) , corresponding to the gaussian model , exhibits this kind of singularity indeed ; compare section [ subsec_gauss ] .",
    "thus , in the present description , the adsorption transition is characterized by a balance of the two irrelevant variables @xmath254 and @xmath0 . in this sense",
    "the scaling variable @xmath254 can be considered as a dangerously irrelevant variable .",
    "finally we note that equation ( [ scalbeh ] ) implies a corresponding scaling form of the chain partition function with fixed chain length @xmath73 : @xmath261 with ( different ) nonuniversal prefactors @xmath262 and @xmath263 and a universal scaling function @xmath264 . from equations",
    "( [ scalbeh ] ) and ( [ scalbehz ] ) the number of adsorbed monomers @xmath28 for @xmath265 and the finite fraction of adsorbed monomers @xmath33 for @xmath266 can be derived as outlined in section [ subsec_general ] in principle",
    ". however , the thin rod limit @xmath166 corresponds to singular limits of the scaling functions @xmath255 and @xmath264 which are rather difficult to obtain .",
    "at least it is easy to see that the exponents @xmath18 and @xmath70 defined in equations ( [ nscale ] ) and ( [ resfracintro ] ) are _ universal _ , using the fact that @xmath255 and @xmath264 are universal scaling functions . to proceed , in the next section we use a different method to obtain estimates for the exponents @xmath18 and @xmath70 for a cylinder in @xmath124 .      in this section",
    "we obtain estimates for the exponents @xmath18 and @xmath70 for a cylinder in @xmath252 introduced in equations ( [ nscale ] ) and ( [ resfracintro ] ) by means of an interpolation procedure between two known cases .",
    "firstly , in the gaussian model one has @xmath267 for @xmath268 , see equation ( [ co ] ) , corresponding to the point @xmath269 in figure [ fig_cyl ] .",
    "likewise , @xmath270 from the scaling relation @xmath164 , or from equation ( [ ka ] ) , for @xmath269 .",
    "secondly , one has @xmath271 on the whole line @xmath272 in figure [ fig_cyl ] .",
    "this result can be obtained by using the _ co - dimension additivity theorem _ , stating that the co - dimension of the intersection points of two objects of dimensions @xmath273 and @xmath274 is given by the sum of their co - dimensions : @xmath275 , i.e. , @xmath276 for example , two - dimensional surfaces generically intersect along curves in @xmath124 ( @xmath277 ) and only at isolated points in @xmath135 ( @xmath278 ) . equation ( [ codim ] ) is also expected to hold if one or both objects are fractal . in the present case ,",
    "one object is a self - avoiding random walk with fractal ( hausdorff ) dimension @xmath279 and the other one is a `` generalized cylinder '' with co - dimension @xmath126 ( see figure [ fig_cyl ] ) ; the dimension of intersection points of these two objects is thus given by @xmath280 in figure [ fig_cyl ] , the line @xmath278 as a function of @xmath126 and @xmath76 is shown as the blue dashed line .",
    "an unbounded , free , self - avoiding random walk does not intersect with `` generalized cylinders '' located above the dashed line , apart from exceptional cases . in this sense , `` generalized cylinders '' above the dashed line are irrelevant perturbations for a free , self - avoiding random walk .",
    "now , `` generalized cylinders '' located right on the line @xmath278 correspond to marginal cases : an unbounded , free , self - avoiding random walk _ does _ intersect with `` generalized cylinders '' located on the dashed line , but only at isolated points .",
    "we thus expect that the number of intersecting monomers @xmath28 grows with @xmath2 for @xmath34 , but only logarithmically , i.e. , @xmath148 , which implies @xmath271 ; compare the case @xmath149 for the gaussian model discussed in section [ subsec_gauss ] , and compare the case @xmath30 with @xmath271 in section [ subsec_general ] .",
    "it should be noted that this argument only applies to _ unperturbed _ random walks , and does not make any statement for walks that interact with the body .",
    "thus , the values of the exponent @xmath18 at the end points of the green line in figure [ fig_cyl ] are available .",
    "this can be used to obtain an estimate for @xmath18 for an ordinary cylinder in @xmath124 as follows .",
    "the shape of the dashed line in figure [ fig_cyl ] is known quite accurately by means of the @xmath185-expansion of @xmath281 in conjunction with the exact value @xmath282 for @xmath134 in @xmath283 @xcite .",
    "thus , one may estimate @xmath18 for a cylinder in @xmath252 , located at the point @xmath128 in figure [ fig_cyl ] , by means of a linear interpolation between the known values of @xmath18 at the end points of the green line ( compare references @xcite ) . in this way we find for a cylinder in @xmath124 the estimates , using equation ( [ relation ] ) , @xmath284",
    "since these exponents are universal and do not depend on the cylinder radius @xmath0 , they are also expected to hold for a rigid rod with vanishing radius , or for a line of lattice sites in a numerical simulation of this system .",
    "we have investigated the adsorption transition of a long flexible self - avoiding polymer chain onto a rigid thin rod by field - theoretical methods .",
    "the rod is endowed with a short - ranged adsorption energy @xmath9 for the chain monomers so that , on increasing @xmath9 , at some threshold value @xmath10 the chain undergoes a transition from an unbound state to a bound state , as shown in figure [ fig_rod ] .",
    "the main results and remaining questions are summarized below .",
    "* by means of general scaling arguments we obtained the scaling relation ( [ relation ] ) for the exponents @xmath18 and @xmath70 defined in equations ( [ nscale ] ) and ( [ resfracintro ] ) , and the phase diagrams shown in figure [ fig_pd ] in terms of the number of chain monomers @xmath2 , the chemical potential @xmath44 conjugate to @xmath2 , and the adsorption energy @xmath9 . * by representing the rod by a cylinder of finite radius @xmath0 we could use available results for field theories with curved boundaries @xcite ; see figure [ fig_curved ] . by using renormalization group arguments , we derived the scaling behaviour of the chain partition function in the grand canonical ensemble , equation ( [ scalbeh ] ) , and in the canonical ensemble , equation ( [ scalbehz ] ) , where @xmath26 and @xmath285 .",
    "notable features of the scaling results are the distinct form of the scaling variable @xmath286 , where the parameter @xmath174 is related to the surface potential for chain monomers , and the curvature - induced shift of @xmath218 in equation ( [ variable ] ) with @xmath220 from equation ( [ van ] ) .",
    "it also follows that the exponents @xmath18 and @xmath70 introduced in equations ( [ nscale ] ) and ( [ resfracintro ] ) are universal . * because the cylinder radius @xmath0 enters the scaling functions @xmath255 and @xmath264 in equations ( [ scalbeh ] ) and ( [ scalbehz ] ) explicitly it is difficult to obtain the universal exponents @xmath18 and @xmath70 directly from them .",
    "therefore we used the co - dimension additivity theorem in conjunction with an interpolation procedure , as shown in figure [ fig_cyl ] , to obtain the estimates for @xmath18 and @xmath70 in equation ( [ exp ] ) .",
    "the check of these exponents and the scaling relation ( [ relation ] ) is a possible starting point for numerical simulations of this system .",
    "* it would be interesting to introduce new methods to derive the exponents @xmath18 and @xmath70 , possibly avoiding the introduction of a finite cylinder radius @xmath0 from the outset .",
    "* it would also be interesting to explain the relation between @xmath222 and @xmath220 discussed below equation ( [ van ] ) .",
    "i would like to thank c  v  ferber for useful correspondence .",
    "[ sec_app ]    the @xmath85 interaction in equation ( [ pf ] ) can be linearized by means of a gaussian transformation @xcite .",
