    "the author started an exploration of elliptic curves from a combinatorial viewpoint .",
    "for a given elliptic curve @xmath1 defined over a finite field @xmath2 , we let @xmath6 where @xmath4 is a @xmath7th degree extension of the finite field @xmath2 . because the zeta function for @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath8 only depends on @xmath0 and @xmath9 , the sequence @xmath10 only depends on those two parameters as well . more specifically , adriano garsia observed that these bivariate expressions for @xmath3 are in fact polynomials with integer coefficients , which alternate in sign with respect to the power of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this motivated the main topic of @xcite , which was the search for a combinatorial interpretation of these coefficients .",
    "one such interpretation discussed therein involved a sequence denoted as @xmath11 , a @xmath12-deformation of the number of spanning trees of a certain family of graphs known as the _ wheel graphs_. in this sequel , we more deeply explore this combinatorial interpretation .",
    "in particular , the number of spanning trees of a graph , also known as the graph s complexity , is an important characteristic of a graph , used to study connectivity , with applications to networks .",
    "additionally , this quantity is known to enumerate other structures such as the order of a graph s critical group , and as more recently observed in @xcite , the number of @xmath13-parking functions associated to graph @xmath13 . here",
    "we investigate the connection to critical groups for wheel graphs .",
    "we describe several properties that these critical groups share with elliptic curve groups , thus demonstrating a relationship between these structures .",
    "( see theorem @xmath14 . )",
    "the outline of this paper will be as follows .",
    "we start by reviewing the definitions and two theorems of @xcite , which are labelled as theorems [ mainmus ] and [ detformu ] below . in the present paper",
    ", we in fact provide an alternate definition of @xmath11 and an alternative proof of theorem [ detformu ] which did not appear in @xcite .",
    "we provide this proof because it will use the same terminology that will appear elsewhere in the paper .",
    "we then switch gears , and in section @xmath15 , discuss critical groups of graphs and the subject of chip firing games .",
    "we will include background material to try to make this paper self - contained , but most of the details of this section come from norman biggs @xcite .    in section @xmath14",
    ", we specialize this theory to the case of a family of graphs that we refer to as @xmath12-wheel graphs , and explicitly describe critical configurations for them ( theorems @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "we return to the topic of elliptic curves over finite fields in section @xmath16 , and more closely study the frobenius map on these varieties .",
    "this section will involve introductory material but we delay its inclusion until this place in the paper since it will not be used in earlier sections .",
    "we also describe elliptic cyclotomic polynomials , which first appeared in @xcite .",
    "this will lead us to section @xmath17 , where the main result , theorem [ geomwcyc ] , involves wheel graph analogues of elliptic curves over the algebraic closure of @xmath2 and the frobenius map .",
    "we conclude section @xmath17 with several additional applications of this point of view .",
    "these include a characterisitc equation for the wheel graph frobenius map ( theorem @xmath18 ) , and explicit group presentations as expressed in theorem @xmath19 , corollary @xmath20 , and theorem @xmath21 .",
    "additionally we answer a question of norman biggs @xcite and , in theorem @xmath22 , generalize a result of his on the cyclicity of deformed wheel graphs @xcite . in short",
    ", we will see that the critical groups of the @xmath12-wheel graphs decompose into at most two cyclic groups , just like elliptic curves over finite fields .    finally in section @xmath23 , we come full - ciricle and present the theory of zeta functions again . however , this time around we shall be considering zeta functions which arise in the theory of combinatorics on words .",
    "in particular , we consider particular subsets of strings arising from a given alphabet , a recognizable language in computer science terminology .",
    "berstel and reutenauer @xcite defined a zeta function for this family of objects and it is their definition that we utlize in this section .",
    "in particular they found that in the case that a language is cyclic and recognizable by a determinisitc finite automaton , then its corresponding zeta function is in fact rational .",
    "we conclude the paper by explicitly computing the zeta function for a particular family of cyclic rational languages and comparing this with the hasse - weil zeta function of an elliptic curve , as given in theorem [ zetalangqt ]",

    "a spanning tree of a graph is a connected subgraph which does not contain any cycles . in the case of the wheel graphs ,",
    "a spanning tree is easily defined as a collection of disconnected arcs on the rim , which each connect to the central hub along one spoke for each arc . in @xcite , we defined a @xmath12-weighting for such spanning trees @xmath28 by letting the exponent of @xmath29 be the number of spokes in @xmath28 and the exponent of @xmath0 signify the total number of edges lying clockwise with respect to the unqiue spoke associated to that particular arc , which we abbreviate as @xmath30 . with this weighting in mind , the main result of @xcite was the following .",

    "in particular , instead of simply using the family of wheel graphs , we define a @xmath12-deformation of this family where the graphs are no longer simple or undirected . in other words",
    "we use a weighting scheme such that the graphs themselves change rather than the way in which we enumerate @xmath24 s spanning trees .    define @xmath34 to be the following directed graph ( digraph ) with multiple edges :",
    "we use the @xmath35-skeleton of the wheel graph @xmath24 , where we label the central vertex as @xmath36 , and the vertices on the rim as @xmath37 through @xmath38 in clockwise order .",

    "additionally , we attach a single counter - clockwise edge between @xmath39 and @xmath41 ( working modulo @xmath7 ) for each vertex on the rim . finally , we attach @xmath0 clockwise edges between @xmath39 and @xmath42 ( again working modulo @xmath7 ) .",
    "the number of directed spanning trees of @xmath34 , rooted at vertex @xmath36 equals the polynomial @xmath11 .    by comparing this new definition with the original one from @xcite",
    ", we simply note that we have translated the above weighting into a scheme where we have multiple edges in @xmath34 whenever we have a weight in @xmath11 .    by transitivity",
    "we arrive at the fact that the sequence of @xmath10 s are in fact a signed version of the number of rooted spanning trees in this family of multi - digraphs . as an immediate application of this different characterization of @xmath11",

    ", we obtain the identities @xmath62 thus we have proven theorem [ detformu ] .",
    "we will return to ramifications of this combinatorial identity in section @xmath16 , after discussing another instance of the graph laplacian .",
    "we step away from elliptic curves momentarily and discuss some fundamental results from the theory of chip - firing games on graphs as described by bjrner , lovsz , and shor @xcite .",

    "gabrielov wrote one of the first papers describing the relationship between these two models @xcite .",

    ", this topic might appear totally unrelated to elliptic curves , but we will shortly flesh out the connection . given a directed ( loop - less ) graph @xmath13 , we define a configuration @xmath63 to be a vector of nonnegative integers , with a coordinate for each vertex of the graph , letting @xmath64 denote the integer corresponding to vertex @xmath39 .",
    "one can think of this assignment as a collection of chips placed on each of the vertices .",
    "we say that a given vertex @xmath39 can _ fire _ if the number of chips it holds , @xmath64 , is greater than or equal to its out - degree .",
    "if so , firing leads to a new configuration where a chip travels along each outgoing edge incident to @xmath39 . thus we obtain a configuration @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 . here",
    "@xmath68 equals the number of directed edges from @xmath39 to @xmath56 , and @xmath69 is the out - degree of @xmath39 , which of course equals @xmath70 .",
    "many interesting problems arise from this definition .",
    "for example , it can be shown @xcite that the set of configurations reachable from an initial choice of a vector forms a distributive lattice .",
    "thus one can ask combinatorial questions such as examining the structure of this lattice as a poset .",
    "other computations such as the minimal number or expected number of firings necessary to reach configuration @xmath65 from @xmath63 are also common in dynamical systems .    a variant of the standard chip - firing game , known as the _ dollar game",

    "2 .   to limit extraneous configurations , we presume that the sum @xmath72 .",
    "( thus in particular , @xmath71 will be non - positive . )",
    "the bank , i.e. vertex @xmath36 , is only allowed to fire if no other vertex can fire .",
    "note that since we now allow @xmath71 to be negative , @xmath36 is allowed to fire even when it is smaller than its outdegree .",
    "a configuration is _ stable _ if @xmath36 is the only vertex that can fire , and configuration @xmath63 is _ recurrent _ if there is a firing sequence which leads back to @xmath63 .",
    "note that this will necessarily require the use of @xmath36 firing .",
    "we call a configuration _ critical _ if it is both stable and recurrent .",
    "[ uniquecrit ] for any initial configuration satisfying rules @xmath73 and @xmath74 above , there exists a _",

    "thus associativity and commutativity follow .",
    "the savvy reader might have noticed that the firing of vertex @xmath39 alters the configuation vector exactly as the subtraction of the @xmath85th row of the laplacian matrix .",
    "in fact , for any graph we have the following general fact .    if @xmath80 denotes the critical group of graph @xmath13 , on ( @xmath86 ) vertices , with bank vertex @xmath36 , and @xmath61 denotes the reduced laplacian of @xmath13 with the row and column corresponding to @xmath36 deleted , then @xmath87    [ critistree ] @xmath88    we use the algebraic fact that when a matrix @xmath89 is nonsingular , @xmath90 for the first equality .",

    "we now have to deal with the restriction that a word is admissible only if the word induces a cycle of states in the dfa . to this end , we expand the dfa even further essentially copying it three times and making sure the terminal states correspond to the first state reached , i.e. immediately following the start state .",
    "returning to the original formulation , critical configurations correspond to closed paths in dfa @xmath401 which go through state @xmath403 . since a cycle involving both states @xmath405 and @xmath63 but not state @xmath403 is impossible , the only cycles we need to disallow are those containing only state @xmath405 and those cycles containing only state @xmath63 .",
    "such words , i.e. the set @xmath407 is a _ cyclic language _ since the set is closed under circular shift ( more precisely @xmath417 if and only if @xmath418 for all @xmath419 , @xmath222 ) .",
    "regular cyclic languages such as @xmath407 were studied in @xcite , and we can even define a zeta function for them .",
    "the zeta function of a cyclic language @xmath51 is defined as @xmath420 where @xmath421 is the number of words of length @xmath7 .",
    "alternatively , this can be written as @xmath422              the _ trace _ of an automaton @xmath426 is the language of words generated by closed paths in @xmath426 .",
    "such a language is always cyclic and regular by construction , and in fact has a zeta function with an explicit formula .",
    "we omit this proof , again referring the reader to @xcite .",
    "however , we also take this opportunity to mention that the proof is an application of macmahon s master theorem @xcite which relates the generating function of traces to a determinantal formula , or more precisely the characteristic polynomial of a matrix .",
    "moreover , analogies between the zeta function of a language and the zeta function of a variety are even clearer since the proof of the weil conjectures via tale cohomology also involve such determinantal expressions .      using the above terminology",
    ", we can describe the set of critical configurations of @xmath34 as the language obtained by taking the trace of @xmath401 _ minus _ the trace of cycles only containing state @xmath405 _ minus _ the trace of cycles only containing state @xmath63 .",
    "we again note that all other circuits with the same initial and final state necessarily need to contain state @xmath403 since there are no cycles containing both state @xmath405 and @xmath63 but not @xmath403 .",
    "there is no way to go from state @xmath63 to state @xmath405 without going through state @xmath403 first , given the definition of @xmath401 .",
    "thus the zeta function of this cyclic language is given as @xmath431 ) \\det([1-t])}{\\det ( i - mt)}\\ ] ] where the factor of @xmath432)$ ] correspond to the trace of cycles containing state @xmath405 alone , and @xmath433)$ ] corresponds to the trace of cycles containing state @xmath63 alone . on the other hand ,",
    "matrix @xmath89 is the @xmath15-by-@xmath15 matrix encoded by the number of directed edges between the various states .",
    "@xmath434\\ ] ] thus we arrive at the desired expression for @xmath429 , namely @xmath435 where @xmath421 equals the number of primitive cycles in @xmath401 , which contain state @xmath403 but starting at any of the three states .    at this point , we have yet another proof of the theorem [ mainmus ] , which states @xmath436 .",
    "the reasoning being @xmath437 additionally , we have answered berstel and reutenauer s question for elliptic curves , up to an issue of sign .",
    "perhaps other cyclic languages , constructed from the critical groups of graphs or otherwise , correspond to other algebraic varieties analogously .    in this paper",
    ", we have continued the study of @xcite which explored the theory of elliptic curves over finite fields with an eye towards combinatorial results .",
    "the relationship between elliptic curves and spanning trees appears even more pronounced than one would have guessed from the motivation of theorem [ mainmus ] .",
    "not only do we have formal identities relating the number of spanning trees of wheel graphs and number of points on elliptic curves , but we also have connections between the corresponding group structures of these two families of objects",
