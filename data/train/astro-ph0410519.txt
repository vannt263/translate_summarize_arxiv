    "infrared , high resolution spectroscopy has tremendous potential as a powerful tool to study both distant and obscured stellar populations . for the heavily obscured regions of the galactic bulge and center ,",
    "infrared spectroscopy offers the best approach to measuring the composition of the old stellar populations .    over the past few years",
    "we have commenced a high - resolution spectroscopic survey of the galactic bulge in the near - ir using nirspec , a high throughput infrared ( ir ) echelle spectrograph at the keck observatory @xcite .",
    "h  band ( 1.51.8 @xmath5 m ) spectra of bright giants in the bulge globular clusters and field population are ideal for detailed abundance analysis of fe , c , o and other @xmath6-elements , using the approach of synthesizing the entire spectrum . by observing the most luminous giants in the infrared",
    ", we have the possibility of placing the obscured stars and globular clusters toward the galactic center , and populations well studied in the optical , on the same abundance scale .",
    "the abundance distributions in the _ cluster _ and _ field _ populations are important in constraining the history of bulge formation and chemical enrichment @xcite .",
    "we have used this method to derive abundances for four bulge globular clusters : the results for ngc  6553 and liller  1 are given in @xcite , while abundances for terzan  4 and terzan  5 are reported in @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath1-enhancement at a level of a factor between 2 and 3 over the whole range of metallicity spanned by the clusters in our survey , from [ fe / h]@xmath41.6 ( cf .",
    "terzan  4 ) up to [ fe / h]@xmath40.2 ( cf .",
    "terzan   5 ) . in this paper",
    "we present the high resolution ir spectra and the abundance analysis of four bright giants in ngc  6342 and ngc  6528 , two bulge globular clusters with relatively low reddening .",
    "the most recent metallicity estimates based on optical @xcite and near - ir photometry @xcite report global metallicities [ m / h]@xmath7 and @xmath8 dex and iron abundance s [ fe / h]@xmath9 and @xmath10 for ngc  6342 and ngc  6528 , respectively .",
    "ngc  6342 has never been studied at high spectral resolution before , while ngc  6528 has been observed with hires at keck i by @xcite .",
    "they found iron abundance slightly in excess of solar ( [ fe / h]=+0.07 ) and @xmath1-enhancement of ca ( [ ca / fe]=+0.2 ) and si ( [ si / fe]=+0.4 ) and marginal enhancement of o , mg and ti .",
    "very recently , @xcite observed ngc  6528 giants with uves at vlt , finding [ fe / h]=0.15 and moderate @xmath1-enhancement of o , si and mg by @xmath4 + 0.10.2 dex .    our observations and data reduction follow in sect .  2 .",
    "3 discusses our abundance analysis and in sect .",
    "4 the resulting metallicities and radial velocities are presented .",
    "we discuss our findings in sect .",
    "near infrared , high - resolution echelle spectra of four bright giants in the core of the bulge globular clusters ngc  6342 and ngc  6528 have been acquired during two observational campaigns in july 2002 and 2003 .",
    "we used the infrared spectrograph nirspec @xcite which is at the nasmyth focus of the keck  ii telescope .",
    "the high resolution echelle mode , with a slit width of @xmath11 ( 3 pixels ) and a length of 24and the standard nirspec-5 setting , which covers most of the 1.51.8 micron h - band , have been selected .",
    "typical exposure times ( on source ) ranged from 8 to 16 minutes .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the h band images of the observed core region of ngc  6342 and ngc  6528 taken with the slit viewing camera ( scam ) of nirspec , which has a field of view of 46@xmath1246and a scale of @xmath13@xmath14 .",
    "the raw two dimensional spectra were processed using the redspec idl - based package written at the ucla ir laboratory .",
    "each order has been sky subtracted by using the pairs of spectra taken with the object nodded along the slit , and subsequently flat - field corrected .",
    "wavelength calibration has been performed using arc lamps and a second order polynomial solution , while telluric features have been removed by dividing by the featureless spectrum of an o star . at the nirspec resolution of r=25,000 several single roto - vibrational oh lines and co bandheads",
    "can be measured to derive accurate oxygen and carbon abundances .",
    "other metal abundances can be derived from the atomic lines of fe  i , mg  i , si  i , ti  i and ca  i. abundance analysis is performed by using full spectral synthesis techniques and equivalent width measurements of representative lines .",
    "we compute suitable synthetic spectra of giant stars by varying the stellar parameters and the element abundances using an updated version of the code described in @xcite .",
    "the main characteristics of the code have been widely discussed in our previous papers @xcite and they will not be repeated here .",
    "the code uses the lte approximation and is based on the molecular blanketed model atmospheres of @xcite at temperatures @xmath154000  k and the atlas9 models for temperatures above 4000  k. the reference solar abundances are from @xcite .",
    "photometric estimates of the stellar parameters are initially used as input to produce a grid of model spectra , allowing the abundances and abundance patterns to vary over a large range and the stellar parameters around the photometric values . the model which better reproduces the overall observed spectrum and the equivalent widths of selected lines",
    "is chosen as the best fit model .",
    "we measure equivalent widths in the observed spectrum ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , in    the best fit model and in four additional models which are , respectively , @xmath160 .1 and @xmath160.2 dex away from the best - fitting .",
    "this approach gives us the uncertainties listed in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "stellar parameter uncertainty of @xmath16200  k in temperature ( t@xmath17 ) , @xmath160.5  dex in log - gravity ( log  g ) and @xmath160.5  km  s@xmath18 in microturbulence velocity ( @xmath19 ) , can introduce a further systematic @xmath150.2  dex uncertainty in the absolute abundances .",
    "however , since the co and oh molecular line profiles are very sensitive to effective temperature , gravity , and microturbulence variations , they constrain better the values of these parameters , significantly reducing their initial range of variation and ensuring a good self - consistency of the overall spectral synthesis procedure @xcite .",
    "solutions with @xmath20t@xmath21@xmath22200  k , @xmath20log  g=@xmath160.5  dex and @xmath23@xmath240.5  km  s@xmath18 and corresponding @xmath160.2  dex abundance variations from the best - fitting one are indeed less statistically significant ( typically at @xmath25 level only , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , since the stellar features under consideration show a similar trend with variation in the stellar parameters , although with different sensitivity , _ relative _ abundances are less dependent on stellar parameter assumptions , reducing the systematic uncertainty to @xmath260.1  dex .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath27 @xmath28 $ ] is the average @xmath29 $ ] abundance ratio ( see sect .  4 ) .",
    "by combining full spectral synthesis analysis with equivalent width measurements , we derive abundances of fe , c , o and @xmath30c/@xmath31c for the four observed giants in ngc  6342 and ngc  6528 .",
    "the abundances of additional @xmath32elements ca , si , mg and ti are obtained by measuring a few major atomic lines .",
    "the near - ir spectra of cool stars also contain many cn molecular lines .",
    "however , at the nirspec resolution most of them are very faint and blended with the stronger co , oh and atomic lines . by performing full spectral synthesis and analyzing the few lines reasonably detectable (",
    "although contaminated ) , one can obtain rough estimates of nitrogen abundances .",
    "stellar temperatures ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) are both estimated from the @xmath33 colors ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) and molecular lines , gravity from theoretical evolutionary tracks , according to the location of the stars on the red giant branch ( rgb ) , and adopting an average microturbulence velocity of 2.0 km / s ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "equivalent widths ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) are computed by gaussian fitting the line profiles and the overall uncertainty is @xmath1510% .    in order to check further the statistical significance of our best - fitting solution",
    ", we compute synthetic spectra with @xmath20t@xmath21@xmath22200  k , @xmath20log  g=@xmath160.5  dex and @xmath23@xmath240.5  km  s@xmath18 , and with corresponding simultaneous variations of @xmath160.2  dex of the c and o abundances to reproduce the depth of the molecular features .",
    "we follow the strategy illustrated in @xcite . as a figure of merit we adopt the difference between the model and the observed spectrum ( hereafter @xmath34 ) .    in order to quantify systematic discrepancies",
    ", this parameter is more powerful than the classical @xmath35 test , which is instead equally sensitive to _ random _ and _ systematic _ scatters .",
    "since @xmath34 is expected to follow a gaussian distribution , we compute @xmath36 and the corresponding standard deviation for our best - fitting solution and the other models with the stellar parameter and abundance variations quoted above .",
    "we then extract 10,000 random subsamples from each _ test model _ ( assuming a gaussian distribution ) and we compute the probability @xmath37 that a random realization of the data - points around a _ test model _ display a @xmath36 that is compatible with an ideal best - fitting model with a @xmath36=0 .",
    "@xmath38 indicates that the model is a good representation of the observed spectrum .",
    "the statistical tests are performed on portions of the spectra mainly containing the co bandheads and the oh lines which are the most sensitive to the stellar parameters .      in order to obtain a photometric estimate of the stellar temperatures and the bolometric magnitudes we use the near ir photometry by @xcite and their e(b - v)=0.57 reddening and ( m - m)@xmath39=14.63 distance modulus .",
    "we also use the color - temperature transformations and bolometric corrections of @xcite , specifically calibrated for globular cluster giants .",
    "we constrain effective temperatures in the range 40004500  k , and we estimate bolometric magnitudes @xmath40 for stars # 1 e 3 and @xmath41 for stars # 2 and 4 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the final adopted temperatures , obtained by best - fitting the co and in particular the oh molecular bands which are especially temperature sensitive in cool giants , are reported in table  [ tab2 ] .",

    "our high resolution spectroscopy in the near ir gives iron abundances for ngc  6342 and ngc  6528 which are in excellent agreement with the photometric estimates , as obtained from the rgb morphology and luminosity in the optical as well as in the near ir .",
    "our iron abundance of ngc  6528 is also in excellent agreement with the one estimated by @xcite from optical spectroscopy , while is slightly lower ( @xmath40.2 dex ) than that of @xcite .",

    "our composition is also consistent with that found for galactic bulge field stars @xcite .",
    "photometry of ngc 6528 and a comparably metal rich bulge globular cluster , ngc 6553 , indicates that these two clusters are as old as the galactic halo with no measurable age difference @xcite .",
    "this has been reinforced by recent photometry in which the cluster members have been separated from the field by their relative proper motions @xcite .",
    "the results of our study are consistent with ngc 6342 and 6528 being related to the field population of the galactic bulge , their composition bearing the imprint of an early era of enrichment by massive star supernovae .",
    "we find it difficult to entertain the notion that type i sne contributed significantly to the enrichment of ngc 6528 , or that the composition of this cluster is different from the other bulge clusters we have studied .",
    "however , the significant dispersion in the composition of ngc6528 , even based on analyses using high s / n spectra from 8 - 10 m class telescopes , emphasizes that the composition of metal rich stars is far from being a solved problem .",
    "the low @xmath62 abundance ratios measured in ngc  6342 and ngc  6528 are similar to those measured in bright giants of halo @xcite as well as other bulge @xcite globular clusters , over the entire range of metallicities between one hundredth and solar .",
