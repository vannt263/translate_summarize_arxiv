    "in contrast , velocity shifts in bal outflows have been reported in only q  1303 + 308 ( vilkoviskij & irwin 2001 ) and mrk  231 ( rupke , veilleux , & sanders 2002 , and references therein ) , although gabel et  al .",

    "acceleration must occur for agn outflows to reach their observed velocities .",
    "nonetheless , velocity shifts in agn outflows are seen quite rarely because acceleration of an agn outflow does not automatically translate into a change in its observed velocity profile , and vice versa .",
    "for example , a fixed mass loss rate into an outflow with a time - invariant driving force would yield a time - invariant acceleration profile with distance in the outflow , and thus produce unchanging absorption troughs .",
    "arav et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) illustrate how radial acceleration of gas crossing our line of sight with a non - negligible transverse velocity produces an observed absorption trough with a broadened radial velocity profile that does not change with time . since our lines of sight to agn are essentially radial , and since agn are fed by accretion disks consisting of gas with predominantly orbital velocities , most agn outflows are expected to have non - negligible transverse as well as radial velocities",
    ". thus , most intrinsic absorbers likely _ are _ exhibiting acceleration , disguised as a trough broader than the thermal or turbulent velocity width of the gas .",
    "what are we then to make of cases where an outflow _ does _ exhibit a velocity shift ?",
    "first , note that when our line of sight intersects the origin of an outflow , the absorption trough can start at zero line - of - sight velocity in the agn rest frame , at least for ions present at the origin of the outflow .",
    "ions present only downstream in an outflow , or lines of sight intersecting an outflow only downstream from its origin due to curvature in the flow lines , will produce ` detached ' absorption troughs which do not start at zero velocity , as will a shell of material ejected in an intermittent outflow . with that in mind ,",
    "consider possible explanations for a velocity shift observed in a detached absorption trough .",
    "such a shift can be produced by changes in the ionization state as a function of velocity in a fixed outflow , by changes in the acceleration profile or geometry ( or both ) of such an outflow due to changes in the driving force or mass loss rate , or by actual line - of - sight acceleration of a shell of material from an intermittent outflow .",
    "observations of velocity shifts are therefore worthwhile because they may yield insights into specific scenarios for quasar absorbers .    here",

    "the redshift @xmath23 was determined from the deepest absorption in the trough , and does not match the deepest absorption .",
    "this can be ascribed to a changing ionization state in the outflow as a function of velocity .",
    "comparison of the sdss and uves spectra suggested a shift in the position of the trough at this redshift . to investigate further , continuum regions around that trough and the trough at the same redshift",

    "2001 ) .",
    "the extent of any shift can be measured by minimizing the @xmath24 between the normalized pixel - by - pixel fluxes in the spectra when shifted by an integer number of pixels @xmath25 ( assuming pixels equally spaced in velocity ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the flux in spectra from epochs 1 and 2 at pixels @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , @xmath31 is the total number of pixels extracted from each spectrum for comparison and @xmath32 is the error for the flux at each pixel .",
    "the sdss spectra from epochs 51821 and 52188 were compared with the uves spectrum from epoch 53619 ( table [ spec ] ) .",
    "a clear shift was found in and a potentially smaller shift in .",
    "neither trough shows a detectable shift between the sdss spectra from epoch 51821 and epoch 52188 , and neither would be expected to do so if the observed long - term shift was due to a constant acceleration ( the shift between those two epochs would be @xmath33 pixel for ) . in light of this ,",
    "the @xmath34 test was conducted again , using a weighted average of all three sdss spectra , with mean epoch 52066 . from that comparison",
    "we conclude that the shift in is @xmath35 pixels with 95.4% confidence ( 2@xmath32 ) .",
    "zero velocity shift in can be excluded with 99.9998% confidence . for , the shift is @xmath36 pixels at 95.4% confidence .",
    "plots of these spectra are shown in the top two panels of figure [ accnorm ] .",
    "it is important to note that there is no shift in the nearby narrow absorption lines .",
    "also , both troughs appear to keep a relatively constant intensity , within the uncertainties .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ accnorm ] shows the excellent match to the epoch 53619 uves spectrum that results when the epoch 52066 average sdss spectrum is shifted by 3 pixels .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ accnorm ] may suggest that the long - wavelength end of the trough has a greater shift than the short - wavelength end . splitting the trough into two sections , we find that @xmath24 is minimized at a shift of @xmath37 pixels for the short - wavelength end and a shift of @xmath38 pixels for the long - wavelength edge , but that a uniform shift produces a marginally lower minimum overall @xmath24 .",
    "thus , while there is possible evidence for a nonuniform velocity shift of the bal trough , the current data are of insufficient quality to prove its existence .",
    "many physical effects could produce a nonuniform shift ( expansion of an overpressured , accelerated shell of gas from an intermittent outflow , to give one example ) .",
    "a shift of one sdss pixel corresponds to a velocity shift of 69 kms@xmath3  in the observed frame or 22.5 kms@xmath3  in the quasar rest frame ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "a shift of @xmath35 sdss pixels ( 2@xmath32 ) over a rest - frame time span of 1.39 years thus gives an acceleration of @xmath40 , where the error is 1@xmath32 .",
    "previously claimed accelerations for bal troughs are much lower than that , at @xmath41 cm  s@xmath42  over 5.5 rest - frame years in q  1303 + 308 ( vilkoviskij & irwin 2001 ) and @xmath43 cm  s@xmath42  over 12 rest - frame years for mrk  231 ( rupke et  al . 2002 )",
    ". our observation is more similar to that of gabel et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who determined the deceleration of , and in a narrow absorption system in a seyfert galaxy and found ( for ) relatively large values of @xmath44 cm  s@xmath42  and @xmath45 cm  s@xmath42  over 0.75 and 1.1 rest - frame years , respectively .",
    "all of those observations involved much narrower troughs than is the case in sdss j0242 + 0049 . also , the 1@xmath32 relative uncertainty associated with the acceleration of sdss j0242 + 0049  is lower than the previous bal measurements .",
    "these factors make sdss j0242 + 0049  a robust case for line - of - sight acceleration of a true bal trough .",
    "still , it should be kept in mind that all these accelerations are much smaller than the @xmath46 predicted for the main acceleration phase of a disk wind in the model of murray et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "furthermore , bal troughs can vary for several reasons .",
    "these include acceleration or deceleration along the line of sight of some or all of the absorbing gas , a change in the ionization state of some or all of the gas , or a change in @xmath47  the covering factor of the gas as a function of the line - of - sight velocity  due to the movement of gas into or out of our line of sight , for example due to a change in flow geometry ( see the introduction and  3.3 of gabel et  al .",
    "2003 ) . in many cases of variability all of the above origins are possible , but there are cases where acceleration is very unlikely to be the cause ( see below ) . because of this , to be conservative we can not assume that bal trough variability is due to acceleration even though acceleration _ could _ be the cause of much of the observed variability .",
    "2 of barlow et  al .",
    "( 1989 ) and fig . 2 of barlow et  al .",
    "( 1992b ) are cases where observed time variability of bal troughs is almost certainly due to a change in the column densities of an ion at certain velocities ( whether due to a changing ionization or to bulk motion into the line of sight ) , not due to a given ionic column density changing its velocity .",
    "more ambiguous cases are illustrated by in q  1246@xmath48057 ( fig .",
    "3 of smith & penston 1988 ) and in q  1413 + 117 ( fig .",
    "15 of turnshek et  al .",
    "1988 ) . in both of those cases ,",
    "a second - epoch spectrum shows more absorption at the short - wavelength edge of the trough in question .",
    "that could be because gas at lower outflow velocities in the trough was accelerated to higher velocities . yet in both cases , the trough away from the short - wavelength edge is unchanged between the two epochs . if acceleration was the cause of the variability , a reduction in covering factor or optical depth , or both , might be expected at the lower velocities where the gas originated .",
    "no reduction is seen , arguing against the line - of - sight acceleration hypothesis for these cases of trough variability .",
    "while every case for acceleration in a bal trough will be ambiguous at some level , comparing the variability we report in sdss j0242 + 0049  to previous cases leads us to believe that ours is the least ambiguous case seen to date of acceleration in a true bal trough ( @xmath49  kms@xmath3  wide ) . monitoring",
    "the future behavior of the @xmath23 absorption in this quasar would be very worthwhile , to see if the acceleration was temporary , is constant , increasing , or decreasing , or varies stochastically .",
    "the latter might occur if the velocity shift is due to a variable flow geometry or to ionization variations as a function of velocity caused by a fluctuating ionizing luminosity .",
    "( recall from figure 2 that this system shows some evidence for ionization stratification with velocity , in the form of an offset between the velocities of the peak and absorption . ) as this quasar is located in the equatorial stripe of the sdss , which has been repeatedly imaged over the past 7 years , it should eventually be possible to search for a correlation between its ultraviolet luminosity and the acceleration of this system .",
    "( from the spectra alone , there appears to be a 5 - 10% increase in the luminosity of the object over the time spanned by the three sdss spectra , but no information is available on longer timescales since the uves spectrum is not spectrophotometrically calibrated . ) bal trough velocity shifts are also expected if bal quasars are a short - lived phase during which material is expelled from the nuclear region ( voit , weymann , & korista 1993 ) . in such a model the accelerating trough in sdss j0242 + 0049  could be interpreted as gas unusually close to the quasar , currently experiencing an unusually large radiative acceleration .",
    "there is a possible case of line - locking involving in sdss j0242 + 0049 .",
    "stable line - locking in a given doublet occurs when two conditions are met .",
    "first , the velocity separation between two absorption systems at different redshifts must be very nearly equal to the velocity separation of the two lines of a doublet seen in both systems ( braun & milgrom 1989 ) .",
    "second , the reduction in line - driven acceleration of the shadowed system due to the reduced incident flux in one component of the doublet must result in its acceleration being the same as that of the shadowing system . this latter condition may be difficult to meet in agn outflows , where many lines contribute to the radiative acceleration and there may also be substantial non - radiative acceleration .",
    "nonetheless , some spectacular examples of apparent line - locking in agn do suggest that it can in fact occur ( e.g. , srianand et  al .",
    "2002 ) , even if only rarely .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : lambda ] , in sdss j0242 + 0049  there is narrow absorption at @xmath50 ( hereafter system a@xmath51 ) and a broad trough centered at about @xmath17 ( hereafter system a ) .",
    "line - locking of a third absorption system to system a@xmath51 or a would result in absorption 1931 kms@xmath3  shortward of those redshifts , at @xmath52 or @xmath53 respectively .",
    "what is observed in the spectrum , however , is broad absorption in between the expected redshifts , centered at @xmath54 ( hereafter system b ) .",
    "both systems are observed in other transitions as well , with system b having more absorption in and but less in and .    in this section",
    "we consider first the optical depths and covering factors of these overlapping systems , with intriguing results .",
    "we then consider whether they could be line - locked or in the process of becoming line - locked .",
    "it is useful to determine if the troughs under consideration are optically thick or not .",
    "figure [ fig : norm ] shows the absorption profiles in velocity space relative to @xmath50 or to the corresponding line - locked redshift of @xmath52 .",
    "system a+a@xmath51 , seen unblended in the bottom panel , is free from contamination in the blended trough ( middle panel ) at @xmath55 kms@xmath3 . at those velocities ,",
    "absorption from the @xmath561402 component of system a+a@xmath51 ( bottom panel ) appears so similar in shape and intensity to absorption from the intrinsically stronger @xmath561393 component ( middle panel ) that we can conclude system a+a@xmath51 is optically thick in . for system b ( seen unblended in the top panel ) we must see how well various combinations of optical depth , covering factor , and geometry ( rupke , veilleux , & sanders 2005 ) can reproduce the profile of the trough composed of blended absorption from system b and the optically thick system a+a@xmath51 ( middle panel ) .    for an unblended doublet , at each velocity @xmath57 the normalized residual intensities @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( in the stronger and weaker lines , respectively ) can be related to the optical depth in the stronger transition @xmath60 and the fraction of the emitting source covered by the absorber along our line of sight , the covering factor @xmath61 ( e.g. , hall et  al .",
    "2003 ) : @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 measures the relative optical depths of the lines . for the @xmath65 doublet , @xmath66 .",
    "in each absorption system we have only one unblended component , but it can still be used to model the other component .",
    "( for comparison , the two unblended troughs are overplotted on the blended trough in the top panel of figure  [ fig : norm2 ] . )",
    "first we test whether system b can be optically thin , with @xmath67 . using this assumption and equations [ eq : i1 ] and [ eq : i2 ] ,",
    "the optical depth @xmath68 was calculated from the observed trough of @xmath561393 in system b. the blended trough profile in this model should be @xmath69 $ ] times the profile of @xmath561393 in system a+a@xmath51 .",
    "( the latter profile is taken as identical to the @xmath561402 trough profile at @xmath50 since system a+a@xmath51 is optically thick . )",
    "the resulting model blended - trough profile is compared to the observed blended - trough profile in the second panel of figure  [ fig : norm2 ] .",
    "optically thin absorption from system b falls short of explaining the depth of the blended trough .",
    "next we test whether system b can be extremely optically thick , so that the depth of its absorption is determined only by @xmath70 . in this case",
    ", we have two absorption systems absorbing at each @xmath57 , but with different @xmath70 .",
    "the total absorption is determined by @xmath71 , which depends on what parts of the emitting source(s ) are covered by neither absorption system , by just one , or by both .",
    "that is , the total absorption depends on the extent to which the two systems overlap transverse to our line of sight and cover the same parts of the source .",
    "we can rule out the limit of minimum overlap , which yields maximum coverage of the source : @xmath72 . in that case @xmath73 at all @xmath57 , but we do not observed @xmath74 at all @xmath57 . another limiting case is maximum overlap of the absorption systems , which minimumizes the source coverage : @xmath75 .",
    "the results of that model are shown in the third panel of figure  [ fig : norm2 ] .",
    "it is not an improvement over the optically thin model .",
    "however , at almost all velocities the maximum - overlap model has more residual flux than seen in the data , while the minimum - overlap model has less .",
    "thus , overlap in @xmath70 which is less than the maximum possible by a velocity - dependent amount can explain the data .",
    "such spatially - distinct , velocity - dependent partial covering has been seen before in other quasars ( see the appendix to hall et  al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the last case we consider is one where each covering fraction describes the fractional coverage of the other absorption system as well as of the continuum source , so that @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( this is case 3 of rupke et  al .",
    "the results of this model are shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : norm2 ] , again assuming a and b are both very optically thick .",
    "the model reproduces the data reasonably well at almost all velocities , and much more closely overall than the other models considered .",
    "the good fit of this model implies that the absorption in one or both of the systems is produced by many small subunits scattered all over the continuum source from our point of view . in that case",
    ", the amount of light transmitted through both systems will naturally be @xmath78 _ at every velocity _",
    "@xmath57 ( figure  [ fig : paper ] ) .",
    "deviations will only occur due to statistical fluctuations , which will be greater the fewer subunits there are .",
    "it is more difficult , though still possible , to explain the observations using two ` monolithic ' systems ; that is , systems in which absorption from the ion in question arises in a single structure along our line of sight spanning the range of velocities seen in the trough , but with physical coverage of the source which varies with velocity ( e.g. , figure 10 of arav et  al . 1999 ) .",
    "two monolithic flows with unblended residual intensities @xmath79 and @xmath80 can produce any blended residual intensity from 0 to min(@xmath81 ) essentially independently at each velocity @xmath57 ( figure  [ fig : paper ] ) .",
    "thus , two monolithic flows can explain the observations , but only if they just happen to overlap as a function of velocity in such a way as to mimic the overlap of two systems of clouds .",
    "such an explanation is rather contrived , and we conclude instead that many small subunits exist in one or both absorption systems .",
    "this conclusion should of course be tested with observations of additional overlapping absorption systems in other quasars , to ensure this case is not a fluke .",
    "note that we have not considered the effects of different covering factors for the continuum source and broad emission line region .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : lambda ] , line emission is a 10% effect at best , and is not a factor at all in the @xmath561393 trough of system b.      the results above suggest that the absorbers a and b are composed of a number of optically thick subunits .",
    "we now discuss what we can infer about the parameters of these subunits , in the limit that each subunit is so optically thick it can be treated as opaque .",
    "assume that absorber a s residual intensity at some velocity , @xmath79 , is created by @xmath82 subunits intercepting our line of sight , and similarly for absorber b. when the two absorbers overlap along the line of sight , there will be @xmath83 subunits along the line of sight .",

    "the intrinsic variance at fixed @xmath31 and @xmath85 , @xmath93 , is caused by the random overlap ( or lack thereof ) of @xmath31 subunits of uniform projected fractional area @xmath94 .",
    "the relation between @xmath85 and @xmath94 , and the form of @xmath93 , depends on the shape of the subunits and of the quasar s emitting region . in the appendix",
    "we give formulae for the cases of rectangular subunits of width @xmath94 and unit length and of circular subunits of area @xmath94 , under the approximation that the emitting region of the quasar is projected on the sky as a square of unit area and uniform surface brightness ( see the discussion in the appendix ) . in both cases ,",
    "if @xmath96 is negligible , there are two unknowns ( @xmath94 and @xmath31 ) and two observables ( @xmath86 and @xmath32 ) which can be used to solve for them . more generally , we can constrain the subunit number and size as follows .",
    "we have a predicted profile @xmath97 and an observed profile @xmath98 , both of which depend on velocity . in our case",
    ", the wide range of @xmath29 over the full trough and the smooth pixel - to - pixel distribution of @xmath29 can not simultaneously be reproduced at fixed @xmath31 .",
    "reproducing the wide range of @xmath29 would require a small @xmath31 , which would not generate as smooth a velocity profile as observed .",
    "each subunit will probably have a velocity dispersion of only @xmath910  kms@xmath3  ( peterson 1997 ) , so for small @xmath31 strong variations in @xmath29 would be seen on that velocity scale .",
    "thus , the range in @xmath29 means either @xmath31 or @xmath94 varies with velocity , or both do . to simplify the problem , we assume the subunits have a uniform size so that @xmath94 is constant and @xmath99 .",
    "( this should be an adequate approximation if the subunits have a characteristic size scale . )",

    "setting @xmath108 as discussed above and approximating the variance on @xmath31 as @xmath92 , we have @xmath109 ^ 2 + i_b^2\\sigma_a^2+i_a^2\\sigma_b^2.\\ ] ] the probability of observing a residual intensity @xmath110 in a pixel , given a predicted value @xmath29 and associated @xmath89 , is @xmath111.\\ ] ] each pixel has a different @xmath89 which depends on the adopted @xmath94 .",

    "99% of the continuum emission at rest - frame 1400   comes from @xmath122 , where @xmath123  cm is the schwarzschild radius of the black hole .",
    "since the relative sizes derived above were referenced to a square , not a circle , we adopt the square that has the same area as a circle with radius @xmath124 , which has sides of length @xmath125  cm .",
    "thus , we find a best - fit filament width of @xmath126  cm , with a 4@xmath32 range of @xmath127  cm , and a best - fit cloud radius @xmath128  cm , with a 4@xmath32 range of @xmath129  cm .",
    "these sizes , small on astronomical scales , suggest an origin for the subunits in the accretion disk for either geometry .",
    "a plausible length scale for structures originating in an accretion disk is the scale height @xmath130 of its atmosphere ( equation 2.28 of shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . at large radii , @xmath131 where @xmath64 is the distance from the black hole",

    "strikingly , the first of those distances from the central source is equal to the distance the absorber must have to cover the emission from the quasar s broad emission line region ( belr ) .",
    "as seen in figure 4 , the line emission in the region of the absorption troughs reaches at most 10% of the continuum level , and at least system a covers both the continuum emission region and the / ] belr . in other transitions , both systems",
    "at least partially cover the and belrs , and at least system a covers the belr . since agn belrs are stratified , with lower - ionization gas located farther from the quasar , to be conservative we assume both systems lie exterior to the belr in sdss j0242 + 0049 .",
    "we use a relationship between @xmath137(3000 ) and @xmath138 derived from reverberation - mapping data ( peterson et  al .",
    "2004 ; rafiee et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) to obtain @xmath139 for sdss j0242 + 0049 . given the @xmath14025% 1@xmath32 scatter in this relationship , this distance is in excellent agreement with the distance required for filamentary absorber subunits to have widths matching the disk scale height .",
    "of course , the absorber could be located at any @xmath141 , so spherical clouds of size equal to the disk scale height could still match the data if the outflow arises at sufficiently large radii .",
    "we have outlined a consistent picture wherein systems a and b , whether they consist of opaque filaments or clouds , are launched from the accretion disk exterior to the belr with a subunit size comparable to the scale height of the accretion disk atmosphere at that radius . as a system accelerates ,",
    "its typical density will decrease and its typical ionization will increase , explaining the presence of high ionization species in flows arising from a low - ionization emission - line region .",
    "when the systems cross our line of sight , they have line - of - sight velocities of @xmath142kms@xmath3  for system a and @xmath143kms@xmath3  for system b. for system a , @xmath144 is comparable to the @xmath145kms@xmath3   expected at its inferred launch radius of 5500@xmath146 . for system",
    "b , @xmath144 is larger than the @xmath147kms@xmath3   expected at its inferred launch radius of 25000@xmath146 .",
    "the spherical cloud dispersal time would be of order @xmath9110 years for @xmath148k , so the subunits will not disperse on their own between launch and crossing our line of sight .",
    "however , partial shadowing of a subunit will produce differential radiative acceleration of the subunit .",
    "substantial radiative acceleration could thus shorten the subunit lifetimes considerably .",
    "one potential complication is that the observed profile of the overlapping trough deviates from the multiplicative prediction ( figure 6 , bottom panel ) in a manner that is not random on velocity scales larger than @xmath910  kms@xmath3 .",
    "however , deviations on such scales should be random if , as expected , the individual subunits have velocity dispersions of that order .",
    "instead , the deviations seem to be coherent on @xmath9100  kms@xmath3  scales",
    ". it may be that the subunits do have velocity widths of that order due to microturbulence ( bottorff et  al . 2000 ) .",
    "another possible explanation is that the outflow consists of filaments wherein the material is accelerated so that its line - of - sight velocity increases by @xmath9100  kms@xmath3  as it crosses the line of sight ( e.g. , arav et  al .",
    "deviations from the expected profile should then persist for @xmath9100  kms@xmath3   instead of @xmath910  kms@xmath3 . as compared to a model without line - of - sight acceleration",
    ", there could be the same average number of filaments , but the number would change more slowly with velocity ( although other effects , such as filaments not being exactly parallel , can affect that as well ) .",
    "observations of additional overlapping systems would be useful for investigating this issue .",
    "we note that goodman ( 2003 ) have shown that thin accretion disks without winds will be unstable to self - gravity beyond @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the eddington ratio ; using the parameters adopted herein , sdss j0242 + 0049  has @xmath151 . however , removal of angular momentum by a disk wind might help stabilize a thin disk (  4.3 of goodman 2003 ) , and there is reason to believe such a process operates in agn .",
    "reverberation mapping places the belrs of many agn at @xmath152 , and there is evidence that belrs are flattened ( vestergaard , wilkes , & barthel 2000 ; smith et  al . 2005 ; aars et  al .",
    "2005 ) as expected if they are located at the bases of accretion disk winds ( murray et  al .",
    "furthermore , quasar spectral energy distributions are consistent with marginally gravitationally stable disks extending out to @xmath153 ( sirko & goodman 2003 ) .",
    "lastly , we note that there is no contradiction in using the continuum source size to derive the scale size of the subunits for an outflow the size of the belr .",
    "this is because the continuum source has a surface brightness @xmath154 times that of the belr .",
    "that number is the ratio of the continuum flux near 1400  in sdss j0242 + 0049  to the / ] flux , which we take to be @xmath155 , times the ratio of the areas of the / ] belr and the 1400  continuum source .",
    "belr has been measured in only three agn ( peterson et  al . 2004 ) . on average ,",
    "it is comparable in size to the belr .",
    "we therefore use the relationship between @xmath137(1350 ) and @xmath156 given by peterson et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) to derive @xmath157  cm for sdss j0242 + 0049 . ]",
    "if @xmath31 subunits of the absorber each cover a fractional area @xmath94 of the continuum source , @xmath158 subunits of the absorber will each cover a fractional area @xmath159 of the belr . for large @xmath31 and small",
    "@xmath94 the residual intensity of each region is equal , @xmath160 , but the variance on @xmath29 from the belr will be a factor @xmath161 smaller than the variance on @xmath29 from the continuum source .",
    "thus , an absorber covering both the continuum source and belr will have essentially the same residual intensity @xmath29 and variance @xmath162 ( used to derive the absorber size constraints via equation 6 ) as an absorber covering only the continuum source .",
    "we now return to the issue of whether systems a+a@xmath51 and b can be line - locked .",
    "line - locking occurs when the reduction in line - driving flux caused by the shadow of one system decelerates the other , shadowed system so that two systems end up with the same acceleration ( which may be nonzero ) .",
    "the two systems thereafter maintain a constant velocity separation that keeps one system shadowed ( braun & milgrom 1989 ) .",
    "( however , there is some debate in the literature as to whether line - driven winds are unstable to the growth of shocks ( owocki , castor , & rybicki 1988 ; pereyra et  al .",
    "if shocks can develop , they could accelerate the wind out of an otherwise stable line - locking configuration . ) for line - locking to occur in an accelerating flow , there are two possibilities .",
    "system b could have appeared along a sightline linking the continuum source and system a+a@xmath51 at @xmath163 and accelerated until it reached @xmath52 and overlapped system a+a@xmath51 at @xmath50 .",
    "alternatively , system a+a@xmath51 could have appeared at @xmath164 and accelerated until it reached @xmath165 and overlapped system b at @xmath52 .    the latter scenario can be ruled out because the greatest deceleration of system a+a@xmath51 would have occurred before it reached @xmath50 , when it was shadowed by the deepest part of system b. instead , the deepest part of system b is observed to be shadowed by the shallowest part of system a. if line - locking was going to occur in this scenario it would have had to set in when the shadowing was greatest ( or earlier than that , if less than full shadowing produced sufficient deceleration ) .",
    "if it did not happen then , it will not happen with the observed , lesser amount of shadowing .",
    "the former scenario of an accelerating system b which has ended up line - locked is plausible .",
    "the observed shadowing as a function of velocity could in principle have halted system b.    one requirement of this former scenario , however , is that the narrow absorption at @xmath50 ( system a@xmath51 ) should not be associated with system a , the broad absorption immediately shortwards of it .",
    "if they were associated , then some of the gas in system b at @xmath166 kms@xmath3  should have come to a halt at 0 kms@xmath3 , where the shadowing by system a@xmath51 would have been greater than the current shadowing by system a. system a@xmath51 must be located farther from the quasar than either system a or b , in this scenario .",
    "the optically thickest part of system a is likely at @xmath167 kms@xmath3 , where numerous low - ionization species are seen .",
    "if any gas in system b was observed at @xmath168 kms@xmath3 , that gas would have passed the point of maximum shadowing without becoming line - locked .",
    "in fact , no gas in system b is seen at @xmath168 kms@xmath3 , consistent with system b being line - locked .",
    "one argument against this scenario is that if system b has been halted by the observed shadowing , gas at different velocities in that system has been halted by different amounts of shadowing .",
    "for example , gas at @xmath169 kms@xmath3   has been halted by shadowing of only @xmath930% of the continuum , while gas at @xmath170 kms@xmath3  has been halted by shadowing of @xmath995% of the continuum .",
    "it may be more physically plausible to suggest that gas at @xmath170 kms@xmath3  has been halted , but that gas at @xmath169 kms@xmath3  has not yet been sufficiently shadowed to become line - locked .",
    "in other words , in this model system b is in the process of becoming line - locked .",
    "however , comparison of the sdss and uves spectra shows no evidence for variability in these troughs .",
    "the timescale for velocity changes in this scenario could be longer than 1.4 years ( rest - frame ) , which would rule out line locking in a murray et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) disk wind in which the entire acceleration phase lasts @xmath171  years , or the line - locking could be occuring in a helical flow , stable on timescales of years , in which our sightline intercepts the flow before the gas becomes line - locked .    finally , note that the profiles in sdss j0242 + 0049  are intriguingly similar to some of the potentially line - locked profiles seen in rx  j1230.8 + 0115 ( ganguly et  al . 2003 ) .",
    "the @xmath172 system in that object has a profile similar to that of system a+a@xmath51 ( strongest absorption at both ends of the profile ) , and its @xmath173 system is similar to that of system b ( optically thick , with the strongest absorption in the middle of the profile , at a velocity corresponding to the weakest absorption in the other system ) .",
    "both systems have only about half the velocity widths of those in sdss j0242 + 0049 , however , and the relative velocities of the two systems are reversed  the weaker , single - peaked absorption profile has the lower outflow velocity .",
    "it is also worth noting that the ly@xmath22 absorption profile in each object appears to share the same covering factor as the species discussed above , while at least one moderately higher - ionization species in each object ( here , and in rx  j1230.8 + 0115 ) has a larger covering factor which yields nearly black absorption troughs .",
    "whether these similarities are just coincidences will require data on more candidate line - locking systems .",
    "( the line - locked systems in q  1511 + 091 studied by srianand et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) are much more complex , but do not seem to include any profiles similar to those in sdss j0242 + 0049 . )",
    "we find that the bal trough at @xmath23 in the spectrum of sdss j0242 + 0049   ( @xmath21  kms@xmath3  relative to the quasar s rest frame ) has likely undergone an acceleration of @xmath40 over a period of 1.39 rest - frame years .",
    "this is the largest acceleration yet reported in a bal trough @xmath1741000  kms@xmath3  wide .",
    "we also derive constraints on the outflow properties of two absorption systems , overlapping and possibly line - locked in , at @xmath175 and @xmath54 ( @xmath176  kms@xmath3  and @xmath177  kms@xmath3  relative to the quasar , respectively ) . the overlapping trough in common to both systems indicates that at least one of the systems must consist of individual subunits .",
    "this contrasts with results strongly suggesting that the belr itself consists of a smooth flow , rather than a clumped one ( laor et  al .",
    "2006 ) , but agrees with results for a narrow intrinsic absorber in the gravitational lens rxs j1131@xmath481231 ( sluse et  al . 2007 ) .",
    "assuming identical , opaque subunits , our data are consistent with spherical clouds of radius @xmath0  cm or linear filaments of width @xmath1  cm .",
    "these subunits must be located at or beyond the broad emission line region . at that distance ,",
    "the above filament width is equal to the predicted scale height of the outer atmosphere of a thin accretion disk",
    ". insofar as that is a natural length scale for structures originating in an accretion disk , these observations are evidence that the accretion disk is the source of the absorption systems",
    ". it would be useful to obtain high - resolution spectra of additional cases of distinct but overlapping intrinsic absorption troughs in quasar spectra to determine if this case is representative .",
    "if so , it would also be worth extending this work s analytic study of the implications of the residual intensity variance to numerical studies including a realistic quasar geometry , a range in absorber sizes and optical depths , etc .",
