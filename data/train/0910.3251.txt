    "strongly irreducible heegaard surfaces often behave much like incompressible surfaces so this result guarantees that every manifold contains a potentially useful surface .",
    "casson and gordon s result was reproved by scharlemann and thompson in @xcite as a consequence of their work on generalized heegaard splittings of @xmath5-manifolds . in this construction instead of splitting the manifold along a single surface into two compression bodies , they obtain two collections of surfaces , thin and thick , whose union cuts the manifold into multiple compression bodies .",
    "scharlemann and thompson define a complexity on such splittings and show that if a generalized heegaard surface is of minimal complexity , each of the thin surfaces is incompressible .",

    "tomova in @xcite weakened the hypothesis and showed that a slightly weaker result can be obtained if @xmath1 is a closed manifold containing a link and it has a c - weakly reducible bridge surface , see section [ subsec : def ] for the relevant definitions . however due to technical difficulties the result was not proven for manifolds with boundary .    in their recent paper @xcite",

    "this opens the door for a complete generalization of casson and gordon s result .",
    "in the current paper we will show that if @xmath1 is a compact manifold and @xmath0 is a properly embedded graph so that there is a bridge surface for @xmath12 that is @xmath13-c - weakly reducible , then either the bridge surface can be simplified or @xmath1 contains an essential surface transverse to @xmath0 .",
