    "a definition for lower ricci curvature bounds in metric measure spaces using mass transportation was given independently by sturm @xcite and by lott and villani @xcite .",
    "both definitions use convexity inequalities for functionals in the space of probability measures .",
    "because sturm s definition requires these inequalities for much smaller class of functionals it is at least a priori weaker . in their seminal papers sturm , and lott and villani established most of the essential properties of metric measure spaces with lower ricci curvature bounds ; such as the stability under the measured gromov - hausdorff convergence and coincidence with the riemannian definition .",
    "however , one of the basic tools for doing analysis in these spaces was still missing , namely the local poincar inequality .",
    "the validity of the local poincar inequality was proved by lott and villani @xcite in the special case where the space was assumed to be nonbranching , see also @xcite . very recently",
    "this nonbranching assumption was removed in @xcite for spaces with lower ricci curvature bounds in the sense of lott and villani . in this paper",
    "we go one step further and prove the local poincar inequalities in the case of possibly branching spaces with ricci curvature bounded from below in the sense of sturm .",
    "see section [ sec : definitions ] for the definitions of the ricci curvature bounds .",
    "the constants in the poincar inequalities we prove here are essentially the same that were obtained in @xcite .",
    "notice that in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2 ) there should also be the @xmath0-term in the constant which we have in the theorem below .",

    "we also have this result using the definition of sturm .",

    "then we have the local poincar type inequality @xmath23    the proof of the local poincar inequalities is based on the existence of geodesics in the wasserstein space along which the densities of all the measures are suitably bounded from above .",
    "the existence of such geodesic is already interesting by itself .",
    "density bounds along geodesics have turned out to be useful in analysis on metric spaces and in particular on genuinely infinite dimensional metric spaces where the lack of doubling measures restricts the use of local poincar inequalities .",
    "see @xcite for recent development in this direction",

    "if in the case @xmath33 we construct a similar geodesic between a point mass and an absolutely continuous measure , we obtain the so called measure contraction property as defined by ohta @xcite .",

    "the measure contraction property , just like the local poincar inequalities , was already known to hold in @xmath1 spaces under the nonbranching assumption @xcite .",
    "there are many definitions of the measure contraction property . a stronger version than what we consider here was given by sturm in @xcite where he also showed that a different type of poincar inequality follows from this definition without any assumption on nonbranching .",
    "it should be emphasized that we prove theorem [ thm : mcp ] only with the weaker measure contraction property defined by ohta . using the results of this paper the implications between different conditions without any assumption on nonbranching",

    "if the answer to question [ q1 ] is positive , the methods of this paper might help in proving it . indeed ,",
    "what would be needed for the proof would be geodesics along which all the functionals used in the definition by lott and villani satisfy a convexity inequality .",
    "the theme of this paper is to find better geodesics than the ones given directly by the curvature - dimension condition .",
    "however , we were not able to show the existence of geodesics that would answer question [ q1 ] .",
    "[ q2 ] does a local poincar inequality follow already from the @xmath36 as defined by ohta ?    because the definition of the measure contraction property involves a point mass , see section [ sec : definitions ] , the proof for the local poincar inequalities as introduced in @xcite does not seem to work in spaces with only the property @xmath36 . notice that again in nonbranching spaces @xmath36 in the sense of ohta implies a local poincar inequality @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : definitions ] we give the relevant definitions and background . in section [ sec : construction ] we construct the good geodesics of theorem [ thm : goodgeodesic ] . here",
    "the construction in the case @xmath38 requires more work than in the boundedly compact case because the existence of suitable minimizers does not immediately follow from a compactness result .",
    "in section [ sec : poincare ] we derive the local poincar inequalities of theorem [ thm : main ] and theorem [ thm : main2 ] from the existence of good geodesic stated in theorem [ thm : goodgeodesic ] .",
    "the validity of the local poincar inequalities are stated in a more general form in theorem [ thm : general ] . in this section",
    "we also show that theorem [ thm : general ] can be applied for example in boundedly compact spaces where a suitable functional is weakly displacement convex .    in the final section , section [ sec : mcp ] ,",
    "we prove theorem [ thm : mcp ] which says that the @xmath1 spaces satisfy @xmath36 . here",
    "the difference to the rest of the paper is that we will need to construct the good geodesics between a point mass and an absolutely continuous measure .",
    "however , the strategy of constructing geodesics which is used in section [ sec : construction ] works also in this case with only minor modifications .",
    "many thanks are due to luigi ambrosio for his mentoring and valuable feedback .",

    "is now a significant part of the theory . for an introduction on the analysis done on metric spaces we refer to the book by heinonen @xcite .",
    "a metric measure space @xmath22 admits a weak local @xmath55-poincar inequality with @xmath56 if there exist constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 such that for any continuous function @xmath8 defined on @xmath44 , any point @xmath4 and radius @xmath5 such that @xmath59 and any upper gradient @xmath7 of @xmath8 we have @xmath60 where the barred integral denotes the average integral and @xmath61 denotes the average of @xmath8 in the ball @xmath62 .",

    "if the balls on both sides of the inequality can be taken to be the same , meaning that we can take @xmath67 , the inequality is called a strong local poincar inequality . in a doubling geodesic metric space",

    "moreover , in the case of measured gromov - hausdorff limits of riemannian manifolds with ricci curvature bounded below local poincar inequalities are also known to hold @xcite . in @xcite a local poincar inequality was proved in nonbranching metric spaces with nonnegative ricci curvature , see also @xcite . in @xcite this result was generalized ( with the definition used by lott and villani ) by removing the assumption for the space to be nonbranching .",
    "this paper continues this line of investigation .",
    "notice that poincar inequalities have also been proved in many other classes of metric spaces , for example in locally linearly contractible ahlfors - regular metric spaces @xcite .",
    "the definitions of lower ricci curvature bounds considered by lott , sturm and villani use the theory of optimal mass transportation .",
    "this theory has a long history starting from the work of monge in the 18th century @xcite . in the modern formulation of the mass transportation problem , which was developed by kantorovich @xcite ,",
    "the transportation of the mass is optimized among all possible measures with correctly fixed marginals .",
    "the main reason for using measures instead of mappings for transporting mass is that with measures in most situations we have the existence of optimal transportation , and more importantly the existence of a transport to begin with .",
    "the problem with transport maps is that they can not split measure , which is sometimes necessary .",
    "see for instance the recent paper @xcite for the assumptions that are needed for the existence of optimal mappings in the spaces we study here .",
    "we refer to the book by villani @xcite for a detailed account on the history and modern theory of optimal mass transportation .",
    "the consideration of optimal mass transportation leads to the definition of wasserstein space @xmath68 .",
    "the distance between two probability measures @xmath69 in this space is given by @xmath70 where the infimum is taken over all @xmath71 with @xmath41 as its first marginal and @xmath72 as the second , i.e. @xmath73 and @xmath74 for all borel subsets @xmath75 of the space @xmath44 .",
    "notice that in the case where the distance @xmath76 is not bounded the function @xmath77 is strictly speaking not a distance as the above infimum can also take an infinite value .",

    "the second set of definitions , following the work of sturm @xcite , requires the same convexity inequality only for the critical entropy functionals . the third definition , the measure contraction property , is different from the two previous ones .",

    "* lemma 1 ) the needed geodesics were given directly by the curvature - dimension condition .",
    "the upper bound on the density along these geodesics was obtained in a standard way by taking the limit as @xmath138 of the @xmath139-norms of the densities of the measures .",

    "we define the geodesic on a dense set of parameters .",

    "this latter point is easy to prove as it follows directly from the lower semicontinuity of suitable functionals in the wasserstein space .",
    "the slightly harder part is to find the correct midpoints .",
    "the general scheme of selecting the midpoints , which we again learned from k .-",
    "sturm , uses minimizers of suitable functionals .",
    "the functionals which we minimize here are natural for the problem : they simply measure the excess mass of the measure above a given density threshold .",
    "we want to show that there exists a measure among the midpoints with zero excess mass meaning that the density of the measure is bounded from above by the threshold .",
    "to this aim we first of all prove that there exists a minimizer of this functional .",
    "in boundedly compact spaces this follows using the direct method in calculus of variations , because the functional is lower semicontinuous and the set of midpoints is compact . in @xmath21 spaces , which usually are not boundedly compact ,",

    "the claim is then that the functional at the minimizer is indeed zero . to prove this we have to use our assumption that we are in a @xmath1 space",
    "this allows us to `` spread '' the excess mass ( if there is any ) to a larger set when measured with the underlying measure @xmath40 .",
    "this spreading of mass then proves that actually there can be no excess mass at all at the minimum .",
    "hence the upper bound on the density and the local poincar inequality follow .",
    "we now gather all the parts that are needed for the proof .",
    "the role of each part should be clear from the outline we gave for the proof .",
