    "the bicep-2 team just announced the detection of primordial cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) b - mode polarization , implying a tensor - to - scalar ratio of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the positive detection of primordial gravitational waves constitutes a major advance for early universe cosmology , giving us a new diagnostic tool with which to scrutinize models of the very early universe against observational data .",
    "conventional adiabatic cosmological fluctuations do not predict any b - mode polarization at the linear level in cosmological perturbation theory . hence in the context of the simplest models , primordial b - mode polarization must be due to gravitational waves .    although the bicep-2 collaboration s analysis took @xmath1 as a prior in its simulated data ,",
    "we wish to ask whether a suppression of power in the bb angular power spectrum at large angular scales relative to smaller scales might be seen in the data , in particular in the b2 x keck cross correlation function at long wavelengths ( which is less sensitive to systematic noise ) and in the b2 x b2 correlation function , although the latter is more susceptible to contamination from foregrounds ( see fig . [ bicepfig ] ) .",
    "whether this suppression is statistically significant remains to be seen .",
    "if it is , it could be interpreted as indicative of a positive tilt of the primordial tensor spectrum at the largest angular scales .",
    "if this does turn out to be the case , then this result would be very hard to interpret in the context of the standard inflationary paradigm of early universe cosmology ( see also @xcite for an analysis of the additional tension between measuring a large @xmath2 with the small @xmath3 scalar power spectrum ) . assuming that space - time is described by general relativity and that matter obeys the  weak energy condition \"",
    ", inflation generically predicts a red spectrum of gravitational waves , i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "this arises from the fact that the amplitude of the gravitational waves on a scale @xmath3 is set by the amplitude of the hubble expansion rate @xmath5 at the time when that scale exits the hubble radius , and that during inflation @xmath6 . for single field",
    "slow roll models this relation is precisely        [ sftilt ] n_t = -2 , with @xmath7 .",
    "a related challenge for standard inflationary cosmology in light of the bicep-2 data is that the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath8 implies a large field excursion over the duration in which the observed modes in the cmb were produced @xcite : m_pl .",
    "constructing a model that safely accomplishes this is challenging to say the least from the perspective of effective field theory , as field excursions comparable to the cut - off of the theory typically generate large anomalous dimensions for operators that were initially suppressed ( by appropriate powers of the cutoff ) , potentially spoiling the requisite conditions for inflation to occur as it progresses .",
    "however , this is not to say that this might not be accomplished in the context of some fundamental theory construction see @xcite for an interesting claim ( and @xcite for a counter - claim) within the context of string theory , large field excursions certainly appear to be problematic @xcite .    in this note",
    "we wish to remind cosmologists of a mechanism to generate the primordial perturbations from the thermodynamics of _ closed _ strings in a quasi - static background , which    * naturally generates a large tensor to scalar ratio ; * _ predicts _ a blue tilt to the tensor spectrum , * with a complimentary red tilt to the scalar spectrum , both of which relate to @xmath2 .",
    "this construction relies upon a background that consists of a quasi - static initial state in the einstein frame , whose specific realization can be addressed in the context of particular string constructions ( see @xcite for some recent attempts ) , but whose existence we will take for granted in the following as far as the study of fluctuations is concerned , just as one typically does in the context of inflationary cosmology .",
    "in fact , this is the very premise of the effective theory of the adiabatic mode @xcite the so called effective theory of inflation . in what follows",
    ", we will first address plausible constructions that could give rise to the requisite background as motivation for the subsequent section the main focus of this note where we argue that _ the thermodynamics of closed strings in the early universe can naturally generate a large , blue titled tensor mode background .",
    "_    our goal is to provide observations with a novel , predictive , and falsifiable model which can inform the formulation of priors when analyzing the data in a manner that is easily contrasted against the predictions of inflationary cosmology .",
    "whether there are hints for a blue tensor tilt in the data is to be viewed as secondary to the goal of providing a ` straw - model ' with which to contrast the predictions of inflation against , the scientific utility of which needing no further elaboration .",
    "the geometry of string theory is a very rich and complex subject .",
    "there exist very distinct geometries , sometimes with very distinct topologies that are indistinguishable from each other as far as physical processes involving strings are concerned . known as ` dualities ' @xcite ,",
    "the connections between these geometries is one of the most striking features of string theory that persists at low energies , a pervasive manifestation of which is the t - duality symmetry that relates strings in a very large universe ( relative to the string scale ) to strings in a very small universe . in the absence of any background fluxes , in the context of heterotic string theory for example , this implies the duality [ td ] g_ab g^-1_ab where @xmath9 is the ( target space ) metric of spacetime .",
    "the implications of this duality on early universe cosmology has been studied extensively in various constructions @xcite .",
    "the particular context we are concerned with ,  string gas cosmology \" , is a paradigm of early universe cosmology initially proposed in @xcite to explain why only three of the nine spatial dimensions of string theory can be macroscopic . within a particular realization of this framework ,",
    "given certain assumptions , one can naturally generate a large tensor background with a spectrum that is blue tilted @xcite , with a red tilted scalar spectrum @xcite .",
    "the cosmological model we consider @xcite is based on the thermodynamics of _ closed _ heterotic strings . due to the existence of an exponential tower of oscillatory string modes",
    ", there is a maximal temperature @xmath10 which a thermal gas of strings can attain @xcite .",
    "the existence of winding modes in addition to the center - of - mass momentum modes is the representation of the t - duality ( [ td ] ) on the matter content of the universe , wherein physics on a torus of radius @xmath11 is equivalent to that on a torus of radius @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the string length .",
    "this duality leads to the temperature / radius curve for a weakly coupled gas of strings indicated in figure 2 ( where the vertical axis is the temperature , and the horizontal axis the radius @xmath11 in string units on a logarithmic scale ) .",
    "it thus seems reasonable to conjecture that the cosmological singularity might be dynamically resolved by the energetics of the so called hagedorn phase .     of a gas of closed strings on a toriodal background as a function of the radius @xmath11 of the torus.,height=188 ]    the model of @xcite",
    "is based on the premise that the universe starts in the quasi - static hagedorn phase when the temperature is only very slightly lower than the hagedorn temperature .",
    "the decay of string winding modes will eventually enable three spatial dimensions to become large , while the others are forever confined by string winding modes @xcite .",
    "the decay of the string winding modes leads to a smooth transition to the radiation - dominated phase of standard cosmology .",
    "the transition time between the quasi - static hagedorn phase with constant scale factor @xmath14 and the radiation phase with @xmath15 is denoted by @xmath16 , since it plays a role similar to the reheating time in inflationary cosmology .    in figure 3",
    "we show the evolution of various scales in string gas cosmology . in this sketch ,",
    "the vertical axis is time , the horizontal axis represents physical distance .",
    "the two light red curves which are vertical in the hagedorn phase indicate the physical wavelengths of two different fluctuation modes .",
    "the solid blue curve which grows linearly in the radiation phase and is at infinity early in the hagedorn phase is the hubble radius @xmath17 , the inverse expansion rate @xmath18 ( where the dot indicates the derivative with respect to time @xmath19 ) .",
    "the hubble radius separates scales on which fluctuations oscillate ( sub - hubble modes ) from those where the oscillations are frozen out and the amplitude of the modes is squeezed ( see @xcite for discussions of how cosmological perturbations evolve ) , namely the super - hubble modes .",
    "corresponds to the transition between the hagedorn phase and the radiation phase .",
    "the thick blue curve labelled by @xmath20 indicates the hubble radius , the two thin red curves which are vertical during the hagedorn phase correspond to the physical wavelengths of fluctuation modes labelled by @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    ", height=340 ]    the first point to remark is that the horizon is much larger than the hubble radius ( in fact infinite if time extends to @xmath23 ) .",
    "hence , string gas cosmology addresses the horizon problem of standard cosmology in a complimentary way to inflation .",
    "secondly , it is clear that cosmological fluctuations begin on sub - hubble scales and evolve after @xmath16 for a long time at super - hubble lengths .",
    "the sub - hubble origin of the scales makes it possible to have a causal generation mechanism of fluctuations , the super - hubble period of evolution will lead to acoustic oscillations at late times in both the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies and in the matter power spectrum @xcite .    having set the scene for the background",
    ", we now turn to reviewing why this string cosmological background can lead to a spectrum of cosmological perturbations with a red tilt and gravitational waves with a blue tilt , generated by the thermodynamics of strings .",
    "since in the initial hagedorn phase of string cosmology matter is a thermal gas of strings , the initial conditions for scalar and tensor metric fluctuations are thermal rather than vacuum and the energy - momentum tensor correlation functions are determined by closed string thermodynamics rather than by open or point particle thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the spectrum of scalar @xcite and tensor @xcite fluctuations in string gas cosmology proceeds in three steps . in the first",
    ", the matter correlation functions are evaluated using the results of the closed string thermal partition function given in @xcite .",
    "the second step is to use the einstein constraint equations , presuming our quasi - static background to be a given _ _ in the einstein frame _ _ , to determine the cosmological fluctuations and gravitational waves from the matter correlation functions mode by mode when the modes @xmath3 exit the hubble radius at the times @xmath24 .",
    "the third step is to evolve the gravitational fluctuations until the present time using the usual theory of cosmological fluctuations .",
    "the metric including cosmological fluctuations @xmath25 and gravitational waves @xmath26 can be written in the form @xcite [ pertmetric ] d s^2 = a^2 ( ) \\{(1 + 2 ) d^2 - [ ( 1 - 2 ) _",
    "ij + h_ij]d x^i d x^j } , where @xmath27 is conformal time related to physical time via @xmath28 .",
    "the scalar metric fluctuations are determined via the energy density perturbations via [ scalarexp ]    brackets indicate _ thermal _ expectation values , @xmath29 is the energy - momentum tensor , and @xmath30 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "the gravitational waves are given by the off - diagonal ( i.e. @xmath31 ) pressure fluctuations : [ tensorexp ] |h(k)|^2 = 16 ^2 g_n^2 k^-4 t^i_j(k ) t^i_j(k ) .",
    "to determine the energy density fluctuations , we use the fact that in thermal equilibrium the position space perturbations are given by the specific heat capacity @xmath32 at fixed volume @xmath33 [ cor1b ] ^2 = c_v . for a thermal gas of heterotic strings @xmath32",
    "is given by [ specheat2b ] c_v 2 , and hence the power spectrum of @xmath34 , defined by [ power2 ] p_(k ) 1 k^3    @xmath35 is the temperature at the time @xmath24 when mode @xmath3 exits the hubble radius .",
    "as inferred from figures 2 & 3 , the temperature @xmath35 decreases as @xmath3 increases , since large @xmath3 modes exit the hubble radius later . since @xmath35 is close to the hagedorn temperature",
    ", it is the denominator of the right hand side of ( [ power3 ] ) which dominates the final amplitude .",
    "hence , the spectrum of scalar metric fluctuations has a red tilt ( larger amplitude at larger wavelengths ) . neglecting running ,",
    "the tilt can be computed as ( defining @xmath36 ) [ scalartilt ] n_s-1 = ( 1- t(k))^-1k , which is negative since @xmath37 , and arbitrarily small in the limit of a sudden transition ( in which case @xmath38 ) . the power spectrum of the tensor modes , which is produced by fluctuations of the wound strings around a compact space , is given by ( [ tensorexp ] ) the correlation function @xmath39 ( @xmath31 ) , namely the mean square fluctuation of @xmath40 ( @xmath31 ) in a region of radius @xmath41 [ tpower2 ] p_h(k ) = 16 ^2 g_n^2 k^-4 c^i_j^i_j(r ) .",
    "the correlation function @xmath42 on the right hand side of the above equation follows from the thermal closed string partition function and was computed in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a more general treatment ) , with the result that for temperatures close to the hagedorn value [ tresult ] p_h(k ) ~ ( ) ^4 ( 1 - t(k)/t_h)^2 . the key factor @xmath43 now appears in the numerator and hence leads to a blue spectrum . neglecting running ( and thus the logarithmic factor as well ) ,",
    "the tilt can be computed as n_t & = & k + [ tfinal ] & = & -(n_s-1)(2t(k ) - 1 ) , where we see the complimentarity between the tilt of the scalar and tensor spectra .",
    "the fact that we obtain a blue spectrum of gravitational waves is readily understood .",
    "the spectrum of gravitational waves is determined by the anisotropic pressure perturbations . since deeper in the hagedorn phase , i.e. at higher @xmath35 ,",
    "the pressure is smaller , the anisotropic pressure fluctuations should be smaller , as well . hence , the amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum will increase towards the ultraviolet , corresponding to a blue spectrum .",
    "furthermore , we can also compute the tensor to scalar ratio as r = ( 1 - t)^2 ^2 . requiring cobe normalization for the power spectrum for the comoving curvature perturbation @xcite , in addition to requiring a tensor to scalar ratio of @xmath44 @xcite fixes the string length to be given by @xmath45 , and that the modes we observe exited when the temperature of the universe was @xmath46 .",
    "the latter implying that the tensor tilt is essentially equal and opposite to the scalar tilt n_t -(n_s-1 ) , the precise value of which depends on the manner in which the background exited the hagedorn phase .",
    "in generating the primordial perturbations from the thermodynamics of closed strings , one can isolate the background dependence to one free parameter , the ratio of string length and planck length , and a function @xmath35 which is close to the hagedorn temperature and is a decreasing function of @xmath3 .",
    "the precise @xmath3 dependence depends of @xmath47 encodes the details of the transition between the hagedorn phase and the radiation phase , and will determine the relative tilts of the spectra ( [ scalartilt ] ) and ( [ tfinal ] ) , which are to first approximation , equal and opposite ( [ tfinal ] ) . with these inputs",
    "we can also compute the amplitudes of the scalar and tensor spectra at any pivot scale , which is unique for only _ three spatial large compact dimensions _ @xcite . as emphasized in @xcite ,",
    "the key result is that the tensor spectrum has a blue tilt , whereas the scalar fluctuations retain a red tilt .",
    "this feature distinguishes the string thermodynamic generation of the primordial perturbations from standard inflationary realizations .",
