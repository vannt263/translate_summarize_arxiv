    "dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry ( db@xmath2s ) is one of the important phenomena of qcd for low - energy hadron spectrum and dynamics of light hadrons .",
    "the light pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are identified as the nambu - goldstone bosons of db@xmath2s , and the quark mass generation is also explained by db@xmath2s .",
    "the quark condensate @xmath6 is one of the order parameters of db@xmath2s and its magnitude characterizes the qcd vacuum .",
    "since db@xmath2s is a phase transition phenomenon , such dynamically broken symmetry is expected to be restored in extreme environment , such as high temperature and/or high baryonic density .",
    "it is very significant to confirm phenomenologically that db@xmath2s really takes place in the qcd vacuum .",
    "one of the proofs of db@xmath2s is to make sure of partial restoration of chiral symmetry in nuclear matter .",
    "the partial restoration of chiral symmetry is an incomplete restoration of chiral symmetry with sufficient reduction of the magnitude of the quark condensate .",
    "recent observations of pionic atom spectra , especially precise measurement of the isotope dependence of deeply bound pionic atoms  @xcite , and low energy pion - nucleus scattering  @xcite have found out that the @xmath7 parameter appearing in the pion optical potential is substantially enhanced in nuclei . with this fact and theoretical examination  @xcite",
    ", it turns out that the magnitude of the quark condensate does decrease about 30% at the saturation density .",
    "the reduction of the quark condensate in nuclear medium also leads to various phenomena , for instance , attractive enhancement of scalar - isoscalar @xmath8 correlation in nuclei  @xcite and the suppression of the spectrum difference between the chiral partners , such as @xmath9-@xmath10  @xcite and @xmath11-@xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the experimental observations of these phenomena can be further confirmation of partial restoration of chiral symmetry in nuclear medium . for instance",
    ", one could observe the reduction of the @xmath11-@xmath12 mass difference from the formation spectrum of the @xmath5 mesonic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the mass difference between the @xmath5 and @xmath13 mesons is also responsible for the quark condensate through the @xmath14 anomaly effect  @xcite .",
    "these phenomena are caused by substantial quark dynamics , but because we have quark - hadron duality in the description of hadron dynamics , these phenomena should be also described in terms of hadron dynamics , such as nuclear many - body theories .",
    "this means that if one could describe the suppression of the spectrum difference of the chiral partners in a nuclear many - body theory , this does _ not _ rule out partial restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "to a greater extent , once one could understand hadronic phenomena in terms of quark - gluon dynamics , one would have more substantial and deeper insight of hadron dynamics , which will bring us its more systematic understanding in terms of qcd .",
    "theoretically the reduction of the quark condensate in the nuclear medium is naturally expected according to the model independent low density relation  @xcite , in which the ratio of the in - medium and in - vacuum quark condensates is given by the @xmath0 sigma term together with the in - vacuum pion mass and pion decay constant .",
    "this relation is derived under the linear density approximation .",
    "the sign of the sigma term determines the fate of the in - medium quark condensate .",
    "since the sigma term extracted from @xmath0 scattering data has a positive sign , the quark condensate should be reduced , at least , in low density limit . however , one does not know up to which density one can apply the linear density approximation . for further detailed understanding",
    ", one needs calculation beyond the linear density based on effective theories .    because the quark condensate is not a direct observable in experiments , one needs theoretical examination to conclude partial restoration of chiral symmetry phenomenologically . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an exact sum rule which relates the quark condensate and hadronic observables has been derived by using the chiral ward indentity . in the linear density approximation ,",
    "the in - medium quark condensate can be written in terms of the in - medium temporal pion decay constant and the pion wavefunction renormalization constant .",
    "the importance of the wavefunction renormalization in in - medium chiral effective theories has been also discussed in refs .  @xcite . with this relation ,",
    "the reduction of the quark condensate has been phenomenologically confirmed by using the in - medium pion decay constant extracted from pion - nucleus dynamics  @xcite and the wavefunction renormalization constant extracted from pion - nucleon scattering  @xcite . since this proof of the partial restoration of chiral symmetry in the nuclear medium",
    "is based on the linear density approximation of in - medium quantities , precise determination of the density dependence of the quark condensate both in theory and experiment  @xcite is strongly desired .",
    "the in - medium quark condensate has been discussed in various approaches .",
    "the in - medium correction of the condensate is given by the pion - nucleon sigma term model - independently at the first order in nucleon density @xcite and higher orders are evaluated with mean field calculations using the nambu - jona - lasinio and gell - mann - levy models@xcite and the relativistic brueckner approach@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the in - medium condensate has been obtained beyond the linear density based on the hellman - feynman theorem , in which they have calculated the energy density in nuclear matter based on a chiral effective theory and taken its derivative with respect to the quark mass to obtain the quark condensate .",

    "reference @xcite developed systematic framework of chiral perturbation theory in nuclear matter and calculated the equation of state of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a novel formulation of chiral perturbation theory in a nuclear background was proposed and the self - energy and the nuclear optical potential of the charged pion were calculated . in ref .",
    "@xcite hadronic quantities , such as pion optical potential , have been calculated beyond the linear density .",

    "<S> in order to study partial restoration of the chiral symmetry at finite density , we investigate the density corrections of the chiral condensate up to the next - to - leading order of density expansion using the chiral ward identity and an in - medium chiral perturbation theory . in our study </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that all the in - vacuum quantities for the pion , the nucleon and the @xmath0 interaction are determined in vacuum and focus on density expansion of the in - medium physical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we perform diagrammatic analysis of the correlation functions which provide the in - medium chiral condensate . </S>",
    "<S> this density expansion scheme shows that the medium effect to the chiral condensate beyond the linear density comes from density corrections to the @xmath0 sigma term as a result of the interactions between pion and nucleon in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss that higher density contributions beyond order of @xmath1 can not be fixed only by the in - vacuum @xmath0 dynamics and we encounter divergence in the calculation of the @xmath1 order corrections of the chiral condensate . to remove the divergence , we need nn two - body contact interaction , which can be fixed in vacuum . </S>"
