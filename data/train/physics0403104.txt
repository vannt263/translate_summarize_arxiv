    "in the last two decades , dusty plasmas ( dp ) have attracted a great deal of attention due to a variety of new phenomena observed in them and the novel physical mechanisms involved in their description @xcite .",
    "in addition to known plasma electrostatic modes @xcite , new oscillatory modes arise in dp @xcite , among which the _ dust - ion acoustic wave _ ( diaw ) and _ dust acoustic waves _ ( daw ) are of significant interest in laboratory dusty plasma discharges . in the diaw",
    "the restoring force comes from the pressures of inertialess electrons , whereas the ion mass provides the inertia , similar to the usual ion - acoustic waves in an electron- ion plasma .",
    "thus , the diaw is characterized by a phase speed much smaller ( larger ) than the ion ( electron ) thermal speed , and a frequency much higher than the dust plasma frequency @xmath0 ; therefore , on the timescale of our interest , stationary dust grains do not participate in the wave dynamics ; they just affect the equilibrium quasi - neutrality condition . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the diaw phase velocity is higher than that of ia waves , due to the electron density depletion in the background plasma when dust grains are negatively charged ; quite remarkably , this fact results in suppression of the landau damping mechanism @xcite , known to prevail over the iaw propagation in an electron - ion plasma @xcite .",
    "the linear properties of the iaws have been quite extensively studied and now appear well understood @xcite . as far as nonlinear effects are concerned ,",
    "various studies have pointed out the possibility of the formation of diaw - related localized structures , due to a mutual compensation between nonlinearity and dispersion , including small - amplitude pulse solitons , shocks and vortices @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the propagation of nonlinearly modulated dia wave packets was studied in ref .",

    "a very interesting known approach , not yet included in our current knowledge with respect to the dia plasma waves , is the lagrangean description of a nonlinear wave profile . in the context of electrostatic plasma waves ,",
    "this formalism has been employed in studies of electron plasma waves @xcite and , more recently , ion - acoustic @xcite and dust - acoustic @xcite waves .",
    "our aim here is to extend previous results by applying the lagrangean formalism to the description of nonlinear diaws propagating in dusty plasmas .",
    "we shall consider the nonlinear propagation of dust - ion - acoustic waves in a collisionless plasma consisting of three distinct particle species ` @xmath1 ' : an inertial species of ions ( denoted by ` @xmath2 ' ; mass @xmath3 , charge @xmath4 ; @xmath5 denotes the absolute of the electron charge ) , surrounded by an environment of thermalized electrons ( mass @xmath6 , charge @xmath7 ) , and massive dust grains ( mass @xmath8 , charge @xmath9 , both assumed constant for simplicity ) ; @xmath10 denotes the charge state of dust grains ; we leave the choice of dust grain charge sign @xmath11 ( @xmath12 for negative / positive dust charge ) open in the algebra .",

    "@xcite . for @xmath192 ,",
    "one recovers the _ dark _ soliton presented above .",

    "[ figure2 ] we have depicted the behaviour of @xmath196 as a function of the wavenumber @xmath145 and the parameter @xmath109 : higher values of @xmath109 correspond to lower curves .",

    "therefore , we see that the addition of _ negative _ dust generally ( @xmath53 ) results to higher values of @xmath196 ( i.e. wider or higher solitons ) , while _ positive _ dust ( @xmath54 ) has the opposite effect : it reduces the value of @xmath196 ( leading to narrower or shorter solitons ) . in a rather general manner ,",
