    "@xcite , because this limiting value assumed optimal conditions , including the dubious application of a formula at the edge of the regime where it breaks down it is likely that @xmath145 is comparable to the steady x - ray luminosity emitted by the hot stellar surface and alfvn - energized halo : @xmath154@xmath155 erg s@xmath151 .",

    "<S> in magnetic fields stronger than @xmath0 gauss , an electron s landau excitation energy exceeds its rest energy . </S>",
    "<S> i review the physics of this strange regime and some of its implications for the crusts and magnetospheres of neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , i describe how ultra - strong fields    @xmath1    render the vacuum _ birefringent _ and capable of distorting and magnifying images (  magnetic lensing \" ) ;    change the self - energy of electrons : as @xmath2 increases they are first slightly lighter than @xmath3 , then slightly heavier ;    cause photons to rapidly split and merge with each other ;    distort atoms into long , thin cylinders and molecules into strong , polymer - like chains ;    enhance the pair density in thermal pair - photon gases ;    strongly suppress photon - electron scattering , and    drive the vacuum itself unstable , at extremely large @xmath2 .    in a concluding section , </S>",
