    "magneto - optical ( mo ) effects have found important applications in data storage , telecommunications , imaging , spectroscopy,@xcite as well as in magnonics .",
    "@xcite an increasingly broad application of nanotechnologies in these areas sets new requirements for novel mo devices by demanding , among other things , a stronger mo response and smaller dimensions .",
    "for example , small dimensions are important for @xmath2d imaging systems based on holographic principles.@xcite such systems require a spatial light modulator ( slm )  a device used to modulate amplitude , phase , or polarisation of light waves in space and time .",
    "basically , an slm device can produce high quality @xmath2d images if it possesses pixels sizes @xmath3 @xmath1 m and also is fast enough to address a large number of pixels within a single image frame .",
    "slm devices exploiting mo effects have a very fast response time . however , their typical pixel sizes are @xmath4 @xmath1m.@xcite    at the nanoscale , mo effects can be enhanced by using subwavelength diffraction gratings @xcite , magneto - photonic crystals , @xcite and nanoantennas , @xcite which are made of pure magnetic materials or consist of alternating magnetic - nonmagnetic layers . however , as a typical grating period is @xmath5 nm and there should be tens of periods to achieve optimal optical properties , the footprint of the grating is large .",
    "magneto - photonic crystals often have comparable dimensions and suffer from similar disadvantages .",
    "typical dimensions of ferromagnetic / normal metal nanoantennas @xcite can be much smaller than @xmath6 @xmath1 m because of magneto - plasmonic resonances which give an additional degree of freedom for light manipulation at the nanoscale.@xcite however , due to huge absorption losses in ferromagnetic metals , plasmonic resonance properties of such nanoantennas are not very strong as compared with nanoantennas fabricated of gold or silver ( nonmagnetic metals with relatively low absorption losses ) .",
    "consequently , measures have to be taken to mitigate absorption losses , which can be done by reducing the amount of ferromagnetic metals and tailoring fano resonance effects.@xcite .",
    "alternatively , by analogy with subwavelength gratings,@xcite losses in nanoantennas can be reduced by using magneto - dielectrics instead of ferromagnetic metals .",
    "normally , magnetic gratings , photonic crystals and nanoantennas are used to enhance the faraday rotation and kerr effect in different configurations .",
    "@xcite for instance , if the incident light is @xmath7-polarised and the static external magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the plane of incidence , the so - called transverse mo kerr effect ( tmoke ) @xcite is observed in the reflection mode .",
    "less well - known are transverse mo effects observed in the transmission mode .",
    "these effects are similar to the tmoke but occur in transparent magnetic films or plates @xcite .",
    "an example of a transverse mo effect in the transmission mode is the transverse faraday effect ( tfe ) .",
    "@xcite this effect can be used in imaging , data storage systems and magnonics .",
    "the tfe has been observed in transparent magnetic plates and fabry - perot resonators .",
    "@xcite because the tfe response is amplified as a result of the wave propagating back and forth within a magnetised medium , it is enhanced in a fabry - perot resonator . however ,",
    "a typical fabry - perot resonator consists of a @xmath8 @xmath1m - thick plate of a transparent magnetic material sandwiched between a pair of mirrors , which in turn consist of @xmath9 alternating layers of high- and low - refractive - index quarter - wave - thick dielectrics.@xcite consequently , the dimensions of the resonator are also very large , which makes it unsuitable for miniaturisation .        in this paper , we predict and demonstrate theoretically a large multifrequency tfe in single microspheres made of bi@xmath10-substituted yttrium - iron magnetic garnet ( bi : yig ) .",
    "bi : yig is a magneto - dielectric exhibiting large mo activity and high transparency in the visible and infrared spectral ranges.@xcite by exploiting high - quality factor resonances of a bi : yig microsphere we show a strong tfe response at multiple wavelengths at the same time .",
    "the strength of the predicted tfe is comparable with the strength of the tmoke in subwavelength magnetic gratings .",
    "@xcite moreover , the observed tfe response is higher than that in micron - thick transparent magnetic plates .",
    "@xcite however , the dimensions of a single sphere are significantly smaller as compared with the area occupied by a subwavelength grating or the thickness of a plate used in modern mo devices .",
    "the problem of light scattering by a homogeneous sphere of arbitrary diameter and dielectric permittivity is exactly soluble by using the mie theory.@xcite whereas the mie theory can be extended to calculate the scattering by homogeneous magnetic spheres described by their magnetic permeability @xcite , the problem of light scattering by a sphere magnetised along a certain coordinate direction is more difficult .",
    "this is because the dielectric permittivity becomes a tensor describing the interaction between the light and the static external magnetic field ( or the internal magnetisation of the medium)@xcite    @xmath11    by considering bi : yig as an isotropic material , the three diagonal elements of @xmath12 become identical , and in the presence of a static external magnetic field along the _",
    "y_-axis , there is a non - zero off - diagonal element @xmath13 , which couples the _ x_- and _ z_-components of the optical electric field    @xmath14    due to low absorption losses in bi : yig the refractive index @xmath15 and @xmath13 of bi : yig can be assumed to be real and also frequency - independent over a narrow range of wavelengths : @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite because bi : yig is a ferrimagnetic material , the spin - orbit coupling is the dominant source of the mo interaction and it makes @xmath13 proportional to the magnetisation @xmath18 of the medium .",
    "@xcite        by considering the off - diagonal elements of @xmath12 in the mie theory , one can take into account the physical mechanisms responsible for the mo kerr and faraday effects contribution to the optical response of a sphere .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the mo kerr effect in a homogeneous cobalt sphere is small but detectable.@xcite the small mo response of cobalt spheres is due to large optical@xcite and magneto - optical@xcite absorption effects in this ferromagnetic metal .",
    "considerable optical absorption losses are typical of all metals , including gold and silver . these losses have long been known to be the drawback of metallic nanostructures used in photonic devices such as , e.g. , nanoantennas .",
    "@xcite consequently , a large and growing body of research investigates all - dielectric nanostructures , e.g. , low - loss single - sphere nanoantennas .",
    "@xcite in this context , the use of bi : yig as the model material of the microsphere opens up opportunities to overcome the drawback of metallic ferromagnetic spheres .",
    "it is also worth noting brillouin light scattering ( bls ) from spin - wave modes in uniformly magnetised ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic spheres .",
    "@xcite the fluctuation of magnetisation due to spin - wave modes causes a time - dependent change of the dielectric permittivity tensor @xmath19 of the material of the sphere .",
    "the contribution of the transverse magnetisation to @xmath19 allows generating a description of bls by processes in which a single spin - wave quantum ( magnon ) is created or destroyed . in this case , bi : yig still can be used as the model material of the microsphere because bls has been used to study nonlinear spin wave phenomena in bi : yig structures.@xcite furthermore , microspheres can also be made of pure yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) , which is a very well - known material used in magnonics.@xcite    finally , both semiconductor and ferromagnetic properties have been established in some of the rare earth mononitrides , which thus attract interest for the potential to exploit the spin of charge carriers in spintronics . @xcite the refractive index of these materials is @xmath20 and they are also transparent in the visible and infrared spectral ranges.@xcite most significantly , these materials also exhibit significant mo activity.@xcite thus , they might be employed instead of bi : yig .    fig .",
    "@xmath6(a ) schematically shows the scattering by an arbitrary homogeneous nonmagnetic sphere . by applying the mie theory for nonmagnetic spheres @xcite",
    "we show that the intensity of the forward scattered light [ @xmath21 in fig .",
    "@xmath6(a ) ] has multiple peaks in the spectral range @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the diameter of the sphere and @xmath24 is the wavelength in the free space [ fig .",
    "@xmath6(b ) ] .",
    "the intensity of the backscattered light ( @xmath25 ) in this spectral range is low .",
    "this implies that at the resonance the single microsphere has a very directive far - field emission pattern [ fig .",
    "@xmath6(c ) ] .    for example , in order to achieve the maximum forward - scattering intensity in the visible spectral range a bi : yig sphere with the diameter @xmath26 @xmath1 m is needed .",
    "it is noteworthy that a nonmagnetised sphere with @xmath27 @xmath1 m will be in the so - called multi - stripe domain state.@xcite basically , light can be scattered by the stripe domain structure.@xcite however , the strength of this process is very low and it can be neglected , i.e. we will assume that a nonmagnetised bi : yig sphere has the optical properties of a homogeneous nonmagnetic sphere with the same refractive index .    the application of the static magnetic field orientated along the",
    "_ y_-axis [ fig .",
    "@xmath6a ] will magnetically saturate the sphere by aligning the direction of magnetisation inside the sphere along the _ y_-axis .",
    "therefore , in the saturated state the mo properties of the sphere can be modelled by using the tensor @xmath12 [ eq . ( @xmath6 ) ] . in this case",
    ", the conventional mie theory can not be applied ; it must be extended employing , e.g. , a perturbation approach.@xcite alternatively , approximate approaches such as , e.g. , a modified discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) @xcite may be employed . however , these methods have disadvantages .",
    "the perturbation approach requires the application of the green s function in spherical coordinates.@xcite the application of the dda to large mo spheres may require unaffordable computational efforts.@xcite    consequently , we will use a finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method .",
    "@xcite although the fdtd method is also computationally demanding because it uses the staircase approximation of the surface of the sphere and thus requires a very fine finite - difference grid , its application to large mie scattering problems is known to produce accurate results.@xcite the computing power of a modern desktop computer is enough for these simulations .",
    "furthermore , the fdtd can be applied to scatterers with a more complex shape than the sphere .",
    "of course , in this case for scatterers of a complex shape one also needs to solve a micromagnetics problem to find the distribution of the magnetisation inside the scatterer .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "@xmath28 shows the forward - scattering intensity differential @xmath29 quantifying the strength of the tfe in the microsphere as a function of the normalised wavelength @xmath30 . in this case",
    ", @xmath31 is the intensity of the forward - scattered light ( shown for reference in fig .",
    "@xmath28 by the dashed line ) and @xmath32 is the saturation magnetisation for bi : yig .",
    "the change in the sign of @xmath32 implies the change in the direction of the static external magnetic field by @xmath33 and it leads to the change in the sign of @xmath13.@xcite    recall that a similar differential @xmath34 , being @xmath35 the reflectivity , is used to quantify the strength of the tmoke in gratings and other mo devices operating in the reflection mode.@xcite however , in contrast to all - magneto - dielectric gratings operating at a single wavelength,@xcite in fig . @xmath28 the multiple maxima of @xmath36",
    "are observed at a multiple wavelength corresponding to the sharp resonances supported by the microsphere .",
    "we note that the peak values of @xmath36 are of the same order of magnitude as the value of @xmath37 in the gratings.@xcite but the footprint of a single microsphere is much smaller than the area occupied by a grating .     quantifying the strength of the tfe in the plate as a function of the angle of incidence @xmath38 for the wavelength in the free space @xmath39 nm . dashed line  the transmittance @xmath40 of the nonmagnetised plate .",
    "thanks to the one - dimensional character of the problem , these results were obtained using the fresnel formula for _ p_-polarised light .",
    "@xcite , width=321 ]    to further demonstrate the advantages of the microsphere over the existing mo devices used to enhance transverse mo effects , we calculate the tfe in a @xmath8 @xmath1m - thick plate made of bi : yig [ fig .",
    "@xmath2(a ) ] .",
    "such plates have practical applications in fabry - perot resonator - based mo devices.@xcite the considered plate is a one - dimensional scatterer with the spatial variation along the _ z_-direction so that @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , for a _ x_- or _",
    "y_-polarised incident wave , there is no _ z_-component of the optical electric and magnetic fields , and for the incident _ p_-polarised light the medium of the plate exhibits an effective refractive index @xmath42^{1/2}$ ] ( the medium does not exhibit mo activity for the _",
    "s_-polarised light).@xcite due to the dependence of @xmath43 on @xmath13 the magnitude of the transmitted _",
    "p_-light is sensitive to the magnetisation .",
    "importantly , the tfe is not bipolar , so changing the direction of the static external magnetic field from @xmath44 to @xmath45 ( i.e. changing @xmath46 ) does not alter the magnitude of the transmission @xmath47 .",
    "hence , the tfe is quantified by the differential @xmath48.@xcite    importantly , the tfe can take place only in scatterers where a nonhomogeneous or leaky refracted wave is induced by a wave obliquely incident at the interface , i.e. the tfe vanishes at both the normal and grazing incidence.@xcite consequently , in fig .",
    "@xmath2(b ) we plot @xmath49 as a function of the angle of incidence @xmath38 for the wavelength in the free space @xmath39 nm .",
    "we note that at this wavelength a sphere with @xmath50 @xmath1 m would produce the maximum of the tfe response ( fig .",
    "@xmath28 ) .",
    "figure @xmath2(b ) shows that in the absence of the static external magnetic field the transmission curve @xmath40 for the _ p_-polarised light has multiple maxima due to interference effects .",
    "the curve of the differential @xmath49 follows the behaviour of @xmath40 . around the brewster angle @xmath51 one",
    "observes @xmath52 because vanishing surface reflectivity results in minimal interference effects .",
    "it is noteworthy that for the chosen thickness of the slab , which is @xmath8 times larger than the diameter of the reference sphere @xmath50 @xmath1 m , the strength of the tfe is ten times smaller than in the sphere .",
    "furthermore , in a @xmath6 @xmath1m - thick plate ( not shown ) the strength of the tfe plummets down because the interference effect is significantly weaker .",
    "of course , the fabrication techniques for magnetic films and plates are very much well - established and less effort demanding than those for single magnetic microspheres .",
    "however , the recent advances in making ultra - fine magnetic garnet particles make it possible to fabricate single scatterers with a close - to - spherical shape.@xcite yig powders with controllable individual particle sizes of @xmath53 @xmath1 m can be obtained by a microwave heating method.@xcite furthermore , a magnetic garnet microsphere can be fabricated using direct laser writing @xcite",
    ". finally , laser - based printing techniques can potentially be applied.@xcite",

    "we investigated the scenario of a sphere made of a typical magnetic garnet exhibiting a realistically low absorption and high magneto - optical activity in the visible and infrared spectral ranges .",
    "we demonstrated the transverse faraday effect of the order of @xmath54 , which is larger or comparable with typical values attainable with the modern mo devices which , however , have a significantly larger footprint as compared with microspheres",
