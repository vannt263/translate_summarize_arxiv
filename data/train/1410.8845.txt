    "the strength of the gravitational force depends on the scale at which it is measured . at laboratory scales ,",
    "the strength of gravity is characterized by the reduced planck mass @xmath0 gev which determines newton s constant @xmath1 . however , like all other interactions , quantum corrections effect the effective strength of gravity depending on the characteristic energy of the process probing it .",
    "massive particles are particularly interesting for the threshold effects they impart once we start to probe energies above their mass @xmath2 , i.e. at distances below @xmath3 .",
    "this can be understood via a simple thought experiment @xcite : consider scattering a test particle off a very heavy point mass .",
    "the inverse fourier transform of the scattering amplitude yields the gravitational potential generated by the source .",
    "once the inter - particle separation approaches @xmath4 , @xmath2 being the mass of some heavy particle , virtual pairs of these particles are created , the positive/ negative energy virtual quanta of which are attracted/ repelled by the source , creating a gravitational dipole distribution that effectively anti - screens the source , strengthening its gravitational field . therefore , the strength of gravity is increased by this effective ` vacuum polarization ' far enough away from the threshold induced by a particle of mass @xmath5 that couples to gravity , i.e. as we probe increasingly shorter distances @xmath6",
    ".    one can quantitatively understand this effective strengthening through the computation of the graviton propagator with loops of the massive fields contributing to the graviton self - energy insertions .",
    "we trace through the details of this computation in appendix [ appendix ] following the treatment of @xcite , however a quick understanding of this can be arrived at through the argument presented in @xcite .",
    "consider the correction to the graviton propagator induced by loops of various particles suppressing all index structure , we find that the leading correction will have the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 schematically represents the _ total _ energy momentum tensor of the theory .",
    "we further consider the limit where the external momentum satisfies @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mass of the heaviest particle that can run through the loops . in this limit ,",
    "the theory becomes conformal , which fixes the finite part of the loop integral to be @xmath11 where @xmath12 is some arbitrary renormalization scale , and where @xmath13 is the central charge of the theory that effectively counts the number of degrees of freedom running through the loop , i.e. @xmath14 @xcite . as an illustrative example , in four dimensional minkowski space , the central charge of a non - interacting theory containing @xmath15 scalars , @xmath16 dirac fermions and @xmath17 vector bosons is given by @xcite@xcite@xcite : @xmath18 comparison with the free propagator @xmath19 implies that the perturbative expansion fails at the scale @xmath20 , where @xmath21 which is when gravity becomes strongly coupled .",
    "_ that is , @xmath22 is the effective cut - off of gravity at short distances_. however one must take care to distinguish between the scale of strong gravity @xmath22 from the strength of gravity at a particular energy scale , which we denote @xmath23 . whereas the former sets the scale at which unitarity starts to break down in the effective theory from some uv completion , such as string theory . ]",
    ", the latter determines the strength of gravitationally mediated processes at any particular scale _ below _ @xmath22 .",
    "as detailed in appendix [ note ] , although every massive species contributes to lowering the scale at which strong gravity effects become important , one has to distinguish between species that universally couple directly to the matter energy - momentum tensor at tree level ( such as massive kaluza - klein ( kk ) gravitons , non - minimally coupled scalars and @xmath24 gauge fields ) from ordinary four dimensional fields that couple at one loop , in terms of their effects on the strength of gravity _ as one crosses the threshold set by the mass @xmath2 of the species , _ but are still far below the scale @xmath22 .",
    "whereas the former immediately effect the strength of gravity , the latter do not make their effects known until very close to @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , for the rest of our discussion we denote @xmath25 to be shorthand for the weighted index that effectively counts the number of universally coupled degrees of freedom below the energy scale of interest corresponding to the generalization of ( [ ccdef ] ) , such that the strength of gravity at that scale , henceforth taken to be the scale of inflation , is given by @xmath26 in what follows , we work out the consequences of this scale dependence of of the strength of gravity for inferring various quantities during inflation , which we take to be driven by a single field for economy of discussion and because the data does nt compel us to consider otherwise @xcite .",
    "as is to be expected , all dimensionless observables such as the amplitude and spectral properties of the perturbations are unaffected by the changing strength of gravity at inflationary energies .",
    "however , when one tries to _ infer _ an absolute energy scale for inflation , one finds that it is undetermined commensurate with ( [ strength ] ) up to the unknown spectrum of universally coupled species between laboratory scales and the inflationary scale , the details of which we elaborate upon in the following .",
    "according to the inflationary paradigm , the primordial perturbations observed in the cmb were created at horizon crossing during the quasi de sitter ( ds ) phase of early accelerated expansion sourced by the inflaton field .",
    "therefore all quantities that enter calculations of primordial correlation functions ( which we subsequently relate to observables in the cmb ) refer to quantities at the scale at which inflation occurred .",
    "we denote all quantities measured at the scale of inflation with a starred subscript . the dominant contribution to",
    "the temperature anisotropies comes from adiabatic perturbations sourced by the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath27 , defined as the conformal factor of the 3-metric @xmath28 in comoving gauge : @xmath29\\ ] ] with @xmath30 defining transverse traceless graviton perturbations .",
    "the temperature anisotropies are characterized by the dimensionless power spectrum for @xmath27 , whose amplitude is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the hubble factor during inflation .",
    "given that @xmath27 is conserved on super - horizon scales ( in the absence of entropy perturbations ) , this immediately relates to the amplitude of the late time cmb anisotropies , which fixes @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the tensor anisotropies are characterized by the tensor power spectrum @xmath35 taking the ratio of the above with ( [ prdef ] ) , we find the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath36 therefore any determination of @xmath37 , either through direct measurements of the stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves or through their secondary effects on the polarization of the cmb @xcite allows us in principle to fix the scale of inflation .",
    "specifically , by re - expressing ( [ prdef ] ) as @xmath38 one can determine the value of the potential during inflation in the slow roll approximation : @xmath39 we see that any measurements of @xmath37 and @xmath40 determines the scale of inflation _ up to our ignorance of the effective strength of gravity at the scale @xmath33 _ , given by @xmath41 where @xmath0 gev is the reduced planck mass that defines the strength of gravitational interactions at laboratory scale wavelengths and longer . as noted above ,",

    "species up to the scale @xmath33 whether they exist in the visible sector or in any hidden sector .",
    "presuming @xmath42 , ( [ vinf ] ) implies an energy scale for inflation of @xmath43 .    in order to keep track of concepts in the discussion to follow",
    ", we distinguish between what we henceforth refer to as _ the scale of inflation_ defined as @xmath33 during inflation and the _ energy scale of inflation _ , defined as @xmath44 .",
    "the reason for this distinction is that @xmath33 defines ( among other things ) the scale above or below which massive particles respond to the background expansion irrespective of any direct couplings to the inflaton . ] whereas @xmath45 defines the physical energy density in the inflaton field as seen by particles that couple to it , such as all decay products produced in ( p)reheating . we take this distinction for granted in what follows .    in a universe",
    "where there is a true desert between laboratory scales and the onset of inflation , @xmath46 .",
    "however , given our ignorance of particle physics between collider scales and the scale of inflation in addition to all hidden sector physics , @xmath23 is in general lower than @xmath47 according to ( [ rmp ] ) , where @xmath25 represents a model dependent parameter that obscures our ability to infer the actual energy scale of inflation from observations of cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies .",
    "that is : @xmath48 presuming a range for @xmath37 such that @xmath49 , it is amusing to infer that in order to have an energy scale of inflation around 10 tev , one requires @xmath50 universally coupled species directly to the matter stress - tensor with masses less than that energy .",
    "presumably any such particles in the visible sector would have started to appear in collider events accessed at the lhc .",
    "note that as one lowers the scale of strong gravity , the maximum reheating temperature @xmath51 is necessarily lowered as well , since it can not be higher than ( [ vact ] ) .",
    "conservatively , @xmath51 can not be too far below the tev scale without spoiling the standard scenarios of big bang cosmology in particular , mechanisms for leptogenesis and baryogenesis which can occur no lower than the electroweak scale @xcite .    we note as a consistency check on the above considerations , that although additional species increase the strength of gravity , the ratio @xmath52 is independent of @xmath25 and is fixed by observable quantities as @xmath53 therefore the effects of strong gravity are evidently negligible during inflation even if @xmath23 is much smaller than the macroscopic strength of gravity @xmath47 .",
    "hence inflationary dynamics , in particular the dynamics of adiabatic fluctuations remain weakly coupled independent of @xmath25 and the usual computation of adiabatic correlators can be implemented @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting exercise to work out the consequences of extra species associated with the kaluza - klein ( kk ) states of a particular compactification .",
    "one of two scenarios are possible that inflation occurs below ( @xmath54 ) , or above ( @xmath55 ) the effective compactification scale @xmath56 defined as the mass scale associated with the moduli that fix the size of the extra dimensions can be in general ( hierarchically ) different from the actual compactification scale associated to their inverse size . ] . in the former case ,",
    "the moduli corresponding to the extra dimensions remain fixed at their minima during inflation and we can avail of the usual relation between the fundamental gravity scale @xmath22 _ below the effective compactification scale _ and the long wavelength strength of gravity ( the planck mass ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the volume of the compactified sub - manifold @xcite . again , the double asterisked subscript is to differentiate @xmath22 from @xmath23 , the strength of gravity at the inflationary scale @xmath33 . in @xmath59 ,",
    "this relation becomes @xmath60 .",
    "for the example of toroidal compactifications , @xmath61 so that @xmath62 where we have defined @xmath63 as the volume in units of @xmath22 .",
    "comparison with ( [ pexp ] ) implies @xmath64 where we again distinguish @xmath65 from @xmath25 , the former of course being the total number of species up to the effective cut - off whereas the latter is the total number of species up to the scale @xmath33 . to see this another way",
    ", we note that we could also have arrived at ( [ nvol ] ) through more direct reasoning .",
    "consider first for simplicity a tower of kk states on a single flat , compact dimension of radius @xmath66 .",
    "the kk modes are characterized by their quantized momenta along the extra dimension , resulting in a tower of masses : @xmath67 clearly , the maximum number of resonances there can be before one hits the scale of strong gravity is set by the highest permissible momentum quantum number @xmath68 . hence with one extra dimension , the number of extra massive species is given by @xmath69 . with @xmath70 extra dimensions , we have @xmath71 with @xmath72 running from @xmath73 to @xmath70 . the number of extra massive species is now given by ( neglecting factors of order unity ) : @xmath74 which corresponds to the number or lattice sites such that the condition @xmath75 is satisfied .",
    "we note that one could also have inflation happen above the effective compactification scale ( @xmath55 ) . in general , this would involve having to track the full dynamics of the moduli fields on their way to stabilization which does not permit any straightforward generalizations .",
    "however there are certain limits for which the moduli are effectively frozen in spite of not being fixed at the minima of their effective potentials . as discussed in appendix [ moduli ] , this occurs in the limit where the sum of the inflationary and moduli potentials satisfy an analog of the slow roll conditions .",
    "we will presume this to be the case when @xmath55 .",
    "although the discussion to follow presumes @xmath54 , the results generalize straightforwardly were we to replace @xmath22 with @xmath76 defined as the effective cut - off when the compact dimensions have the ( effectively frozen ) volume @xmath77 during inflation .      during inflation ,",
    "all masses much lighter than @xmath33 correct the graviton propagator and will contribute towards lowering the effective gravitational cut - off .",
    "if furthermore , these states are universally coupled ( as are kk gravitons ) , they will also increase the effective strength of gravity now set by @xmath23 .",
    "all heavier kk states do not correct the short range interactions ( i.e. they decouple ) and can safely be ignored . therefore @xmath25 the number of massive species that correct the strength of gravity is bounded by @xmath78 in the case of one extra dimension .",
    "hence @xmath79 imagine we were to saturate this bound @xmath80 where the latter follows from the observationally determined quantity ( [ ratio ] ) .",
    "for @xmath70 extra dimensions , the number of massive species with masses less than hubble will be given by @xmath81 furthermore , given that @xmath82 we arrive at the relation between the number of species that lower the effective cut - off during inflation @xmath25 with @xmath83 : @xmath84 as we shall see shortly , since @xmath85 we have @xmath86 , implying that in general we must also have @xmath87 as one can only cross additional mass thresholds from the scale of inflation to the scale of strong gravity .",
    "we note that ( [ nn ] ) immediately translates the uncertainty in the energy scale of inflation in terms of an intermediate compactification scale @xmath2 in units of @xmath23 through ( [ vact ] ) and ( [ ratio ] ) : @xmath88 or equivalently @xmath89 now using ( [ hinf ] ) , ( [ vinf ] ) and ( [ ratio ] ) , we have @xmath90 so that equivalently @xmath91 it follows that @xmath33 is one to three orders of magnitude below the fundamental gravity scale @xmath22 for the range @xmath49 .",
    "the ratio @xmath92 is of course fixed by ( [ ratio ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we note that from ( [ vhrel ] ) the energy scale of inflation is related to the scale @xmath22 by [ esf ] v_*^1/4 & & 3 ^ 1/4 ^ 2/(n+2 ) - 1/2 m _ * * which depending on the number of extra particles between @xmath33 and @xmath22 implies that @xmath93 can be greater than guaranteed for @xmath94 through the hierarchy implied by ( [ hmfun ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath22 ( of the same order or an order of magnitude higher for @xmath95 ) , even though it is always less than the effective cut - off @xmath23 at the scale @xmath33 through ( [ vinf ] ) .",
    "we note that this is never problematic even though @xmath22 is the cut - off induced by the underlying uv completion .",
    "this is because we remain in the perturbative regime with respect to corrections from the heavy states that uv complete the theory , which relies on derivatives being suppressed relative to this scale i.e. by the ratio @xmath96 , guaranteed to be less than unity by ( [ hmfun ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we stress that although extra dimensions ( compactified at a scale below that of inflation ) provide a natural context for the appearance of extra massive species , the relation ( [ vact ] ) is also valid in a strictly four dimensional context and illustrates an irreducible uncertainty in our ability to infer a scale for inflation given our lack of knowledge of particle physics from collider energies up to the energy scale of inflation .      in the framework of string theory ,",
    "the effective higher dimensional planck mass @xmath22 is proportional to the fundamental string scale @xmath97 , and eq.([usual ] ) becomes : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the string coupling and the internal volume @xmath63 is now given in string units .",
    "the corresponding number of species is then @xmath100 , which is fixed by the number of kk modes with mass lower than @xmath97 for @xmath101 , as is the case of d - branes where @xmath99 is given by the gauge coupling .",
    "again , we distinguish @xmath65 , the number of kk modes below the effective cut - off around the compactification scale from @xmath25 , the number of states with masses less than @xmath33 .",
    "note that the lower bound for the string scale of few tev is consistent with a reheating temperature around above the electroweak scale ( see discussion at the end of the previous section ) .",
    "apart from the possibility of having light kk modes of large extra dimensions , the fundamental gravity scale can be lowered due to a large number of species from hidden sectors ( even coupled gravitationally to the standard model ) , or even from string excitations whose number increase exponentially with their mass . in the later case ,",
    "the effective number of particle species which are not broad resonances , with width less than their mass is @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "the big bang begins shortly after inflation ends .",
    "the mechanism through which the inflaton dumps its energy density into the material content of the universe is known as reheating if this process occurs in thermal equilibrium , and preheating otherwise . during preheating , parametric resonance during the inflaton s final oscillations about its minimum results in bursts of particle production for any massive fields coupled to it ( see @xcite and references therein for details on the points discussed here ) .",
    "the latter is a very out of equilibrium process and requires a subsequent period of thermalization .",
    "since the primary mechanisms for generating parametric resonance have a purely particle physics origin , gravitational effects do not play any significant role and the mechanisms for preheating proceed as they do in the standard context regardless of the value of @xmath23 . the exception being the special case of ` geometric preheating ' , wherein the inflaton @xmath103 couples very weakly or",
    "has no direct couplings to a non - minimally coupled field @xmath104 with a non - minimal coupling parameter @xmath105 . for this scenario ,",
    "we first observe that on a background sourced by @xmath103 at the end of inflation , the mode functions for @xmath104 satisfy : @xmath106 as the inflaton oscillates around its minimum , the scalar curvature @xmath107 oscillates as well . upon time",
    "averaging we have the relation @xmath108 which implies @xmath109 , inducing an effective coupling to @xmath103 and which can produce parametric resonance for large enough @xmath105 . by enhancing the strength of gravity ,",
    "one enhances the effects of the geometric coupling term and thus widening the bands in which the floquet index @xcite is positive , assisting parametric resonance non - linearly the more @xmath23 is reduced .",
    "reheating on the other hand is an equilibrium process that produces quanta of matter fields through one body decays such as @xmath110 or @xmath111 where @xmath112 are scalar and fermionic quanta respectively .",
    "the interactions that can generate such decays are @xmath113 or @xmath114 , where @xmath12 has dimensions of mass and @xmath115 is dimensionless . in the limit @xmath116 the decay rates can be estimated as @xcite : _ & = & + _ | & = & .",
    "thermal equilibrium requires interactions to be efficient enough to equipartition all available states in phase space . in an expanding universe",
    "this necessitates @xmath117 .",
    "hence , the maximum temperature reheating can occur at is implied by the condition @xmath118 .",
    "assuming @xmath119 relativistic species in thermal equilibrium after reheating , we have @xmath120 and therefore @xmath121 that is , the maximum temperature on can reheat is correspondingly reduced , consistent with our discussion in section iii .",
    "we mention in closing that there are rich phenomenological possibilities in considering hidden sector fields produced in reheating as possible dark matter candidates in scenarios with many extra species , certain aspects of which have been studied in the multi - field inflationary context in @xcite was taken to be the usual @xmath47 . ] .",
    "it is commonly presumed that detection of a primordial tensor mode background would allow us to determine the ( energy ) scale of inflation in the context of single field inflation .",
    "the purpose of this note was to highlight the fact that instead , one can only _ infer _ the ( energy ) scale of inflation from observations up to our ignorance of the scale @xmath122 , the precise value for which depends on the spectrum of all universally coupled species with masses up to @xmath33 , and for which field content of the standard model alone suggests an @xmath25 different from one though still of order unity .",
    "these observations raise the possibility that the energy scale for inflation can be significantly lowered by the presence of many gravitationally coupled species , an observation that has a particularly natural realization in extra dimensional scenarios , although is equally pertinent in a four - dimensional context .",

    "one can straightforwardly deduce that the effect of the higher curvature terms will be to modify the usual action for the comoving curavture perturbation from @xmath188\\ ] ] to @xmath189\\ ] ] where we see from ( [ hdact ] ) that the corrections from the curvature squared terms to the quadratic action for @xmath27 must have two derivatives acting on background quantities as well as higher spatial derivative terms from the curvature squared corrections .",
    "] , so that for example , the operator @xmath190 gets a correction of the form @xmath191 where @xmath192 so that the overall dimensionful coefficient of the quadratic action ( [ nonusual ] ) becomes @xmath193 where @xmath194 is some positive number ( by unitarity ) of order unity .",
    "furthermore , we note that integrating out massive particles can only additively renormalize newton s constant such that at the scale of inflation , @xmath195 where the @xmath196 are spin dependent weights each suppressed by a factor of @xmath197 . imposing the renormalization conditions at macroscopic scales ,",
    "@xmath198 so that @xmath199 within the domain of validity of our approximation .",
    "therefore in the context of ( [ mstarhd ] ) , we see that unless @xmath200 , the correction to the effective strength of gravity as seen by the curvature perturbations is negligible and @xmath201 for curvature quanta above the scale of any massive ( non - universally coupled ) species .",
    "in this appendix , we consider the dynamics of moduli fields during inflation in the case where @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the characteristic mass of the moduli .",
    "we wish to show that are regimes where the moduli are effectively frozen even if they are dynamically displaced off their minima , allowing us to treat the extra dimensional volume as effectively constant during inflation .",
    "we begin by considering the following d - dimensional action @xmath202\\ ] ] where @xmath203 is the d - dimensional ricci scalar constructed out of the metric @xmath204 .",
    "we now consider a @xmath59 decomposition with greek indices denoting four non - compact coordinates and lower case latin indices denoting @xmath70 periodic extra dimensional coordinates that range from @xmath205 and where we furthermore presume the metric tensor @xmath204 to be defined through the block diagonal form @xmath206 if we assume @xmath207 , and if no other quantity depends on the @xmath208 then @xmath209 and @xmath210 = r^{(4)}[g ] - 2n e^{-\\omega}g^{\\mu\\nu}\\nabla_\\mu\\nabla_\\nu e^\\omega - n(n-1)g^{\\mu\\nu}\\nabla_\\mu \\omega\\nabla_\\nu \\omega.\\ ] ] substituting into the above , integrating over the compact dimensions and after a few integrations by part results in @xmath211 - v_n\\int d^4x\\sqrt{-g}\\,e^{n\\omega}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial\\phi)^2 + v(\\phi)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath212 . to bring the action above into the usual einstein hilbert form",

    ", we make the metric ansatz @xmath219 and find the einstein constraint equation ( dropping the tilde s on @xmath103 in what follows ) , @xmath220 the equation of motion @xmath221 and the friedmann equations @xmath222 @xmath223 we now ask , is there a solution such that the background inflates , i.e. @xmath224 ? from ( [ f1 ] ) , this clearly requires @xmath225 \\ll 1\\ ] ] where the denominator on the rhs is given by ( [ 00 ] ) . defining the total kinetic and potential energies",
    "@xmath226 we find that in general @xmath227 so that @xmath228 consistently if @xmath229 , i.e. we require the potential terms dominate the kinetic terms in the energy density , as per usual .",
    "this can be re - expressed using ( [ eomphi ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) as a condition on the potential if one neglects the @xmath230 and @xmath231 terms , which is only possible if @xmath232 where the second term above is the usual @xmath233 parameter .",
    "we note from the definition ( [ ktpt ] ) that requiring @xmath234 ( which is consistent with requiring inflation being above the effective compactification scale @xmath235 over a broad regime ) results in @xmath236 so that in addition we also need a sufficient number of extra dimensions in order that the second numerical factor can also be neglected .",
    "one may be tempted to redefine @xmath218 in ( [ ddactf ] ) to absorb the factor of @xmath237 , however this appropriately rescales the arguments of the potential energy contributions such that ( [ srcfin ] ) also results for the redefined variables . ] .",
    "one can understand why this is so we see from ( [ ddactf ] ) that the for the canonically normalized variable @xmath238 , the inflationary potential becomes @xmath239 , therefore one flattens the @xmath240 dependence of this contribution to the total potential more and more the greater @xmath70 is , eventually allowing for the ` slow - roll ' condition on the moduli field to be satisfied .",
    "therefore although it is not generally true that we can have inflation without the moduli undergoing non - trivial excursions we see that in certain limits , this can indeed be accomplished consistently allowing us to treat them as effectively fixed even though they are displaced from their minima .",
    "in this situation , the characteristic masses of the associated kk states remains almost constant during inflation and the usual analysis can be implemented .",
