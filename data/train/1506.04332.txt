    "psr j2215 + 5135 is a recycled millisecond pulsar ( msp ) with @xmath3ms and @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the neutron star [ ns ] moment of inertia in units of @xmath6 ) , in a @xmath7hr orbit with a heated low - mass stellar companion .",
    "this `` redback '' ( rb ) system was discovered in 350mhz green bank telescope ( gbt ) observations ( reported by ray et al .",
    "2012 ) of an unidentified _ fermi_-lat ( large area telescope , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) gamma - ray source .",
    "the radio dispersion measure ( @xmath8 ) provides a distance estimate @xmath9kpc , and this relatively close and bright system can be subject to detailed study .",
    "schroeder & halpern ( 2014 , hereafter sh14 ) obtained high - quality @xmath10 light curves of the companion over many orbits .",
    "it varies from @xmath11 to 20.2mag and thus is well measured with modest - aperture telescopes . fitting these light curves with the elc code @xcite and a photometry table generated from the phoenix model atmospheres @xcite , sh14 inferred a low system inclination and large pulsar mass , @xmath12 .",
    "this is potentially very important , since it would be one of the highest - known ns masses .",
    "such objects can provide strong constraints on the equation of state at supernuclear densities @xcite .",
    "however , their fit showed several peculiarities .",
    "the unheated `` night '' face of the companion was found to have @xmath13k and the heated `` day '' side @xmath14k in the elc fits , in poor agreement with the observed bluer colors .",
    "the light curve seemed shifted by @xmath15 with respect to the radio - pulse ephemeris .",
    "sh14 suggest that the blue colors could be a hot quiescent disk , while the phase shift may be an effect of an intrabinary shock . also , @xcite observed the system in the x - rays with cxo , finding an x - ray minimum near orbital phase @xmath16 ( pulsar superior conjunction , radio eclipse ) , which they interpret as due to variable obscuration of emission from an intrabinary shock around the companion .    to probe these peculiarities ,",
    "we have obtained keck spectra across the binary orbit .",
    "our data show no evidence for disk or shock emission lines , but imply much higher system inclination , with higher companion temperatures and stronger pulsar heating .",
    "this lowers the inferred pulsar mass , but raises the possibility that the pulsed magnetospheric emission is eclipsed by the companion star .",
    "gamma - ray data currently show limited evidence for such eclipse , but additional observations can test this hypothesis .",
    "the system was observed on three occasions . in each case",
    "we aligned the long slit at position angle @xmath17 ( n through e ) to include two bracketing stars for monitoring purposes ( see the finder chart in breton et al .",
    "the @xmath18mag star at usno - b1 j2000 position @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( c1 ) appears to show radial - velocity ( rv ) variations between epochs , so we use the @xmath21mag star @xmath22 away at j2000 position @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( c2 ) as our reference object .",
    "first , using the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; faber et al .",
    "2003 ) on keck - ii , we obtained @xmath25s exposures covering 44509060  on 2014 october 2 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ; mjd 56932 ) with @xmath26  resolution through a @xmath27-wide slit .",
    "these data covered @xmath281.025 , where @xmath29 is optical maximum ( `` noon '' ) and the pulsar ascending node is at @xmath30 . the radio ephemeris defines @xmath31mjd and @xmath32d . for improved blue coverage",
    ", we observed again on 2014 october 24 ( mjd 56954 ) by taking @xmath33s exposures with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on keck - i using the @xmath27 slit and the 5600  dichroic splitter .",
    "the blue - camera 600/4000 grism provided @xmath34  resolution , while the red - camera 400/8500 grating delivered @xmath35  resolution .",
    "these data covered wavelengths @xmath3610,260  and orbital phases @xmath37 . finally , we observed with the same setup on 2014",
    "november 20 ( mjd 56981 ) , covering orbital phase @xmath38 by taking @xmath39s exposures .",
    "calibration spectra of blue ( bd@xmath40 ) and red ( bd@xmath41 ) spectrophotometric standards were obtained during each run .",
    "the spectra were subject to standard iraf reductions , including optimal extraction .",
    "figure 1 shows the reduced , calibrated lris spectra at three orbital phases .",
    "the companion is significantly hotter than the sh14 elc solution , with an effective spectral class a2v near optical maximum brightness ( @xmath42k ) and g0v near minimum ( @xmath43k ) , as determined by line - ratio comparison with spectral standards .",
    "no strong emission lines or nonthermal component are seen , although a weak variable blue continuum peaking at @xmath44 is not at present excluded .",
    "8.3truecm    -0.5truecm    the spectra show a wealth of stellar absorption features , and so we measure the rv variation using the iraf xcaso script @xcite .",
    "the templates were drawn from the indo - us library of coud feed spectra @xcite , selecting dwarf stars with known rv from a range of well - determined spectral classes .",
    "the cross - correlation statistic was @xmath4560 for the day - phase october 24 lris data and @xmath4625 for the night - phase november 20 spectra . with the more - limited blue coverage on october 2 ,",
    "the cross correlations were weaker , giving @xmath4720 and larger rv uncertainties .",
    "since c1 shows @xmath48 rv variation between epochs , we relied on c2 for our rv tie .",
    "this star matched best to a k0v spectrum .",
    "cross correlation delivered velocity uncertainties of @xmath49 ( lris ) and @xmath504.0 @xmath51 ( deimos ) . to remove residual drift in the wavelength solution",
    ", we corrected the pulsar companion velocities to bring the measured c2 velocities into agreement .",
    "the c2 measurement errors , plus systematic @xmath52 errors estimated from the variance between cross correlations with different templates , were added in quadrature to the individual rv uncertainties to produce the final rv uncertainty .",
    "these rvs and errors are plotted in figure [ lc / rv ] as a function of orbital phase computed from the barycentered times of the exposure midpoints .",
    "lacking velocity - standard observations spanning the companion spectral class during each run , we may have additional systematic uncertainty in the absolute rv .",
    "8.3truecm    -0.5truecm",
    "to compare with the light - curve data , we plot the phased @xmath10 magnitudes and uncertainties published in figure 2 of sh14 ; we ignored upper - limit points ( generally from epochs of poor photometry ) , extracting 103 @xmath53 , 55 @xmath54 , and 113 @xmath55 magnitudes .",
    "these data and our new rv measurements were analyzed with two popular light - curve modeling programs : the elc code and the icarus code ( breton et al .",
    "2011 ) . for both we can run in `` msp '' mode , with the projected pulsar orbit @xmath56lt - s from the radio ephemeris . both codes model pulsar heating of the companion as illumination by a point ( x - ray ) source , generating filter - specific light - curve models and estimating binary - system parameters via model fits .",
    "the temperature model is determined by the underlying temperature of the star ( actually @xmath57 of the unheated `` night '' face ) , and a heating flux denoted @xmath58 .",
    "the observed light curves are then sensitive to the orbital inclination @xmath59 and the mass ratio @xmath60 .",
    "the heating power can be related to the effective temperature of the heated face @xmath61 by @xmath62 ^ 2",
    "\\sigma/{\\rm sin^2}i \\eqno(1)\\ ] ] ( effective albedo = 0 ) .",
    "the roche lobe filling factor @xmath63 is also relevant ; as concluded by sh14 , elc fits require @xmath64 .",
    "it is also large ( @xmath65 ) in the icarus fits .",
    "sh14 find that the heating center is phase shifted .",
    "we concur , but find @xmath66 , smaller than the @xmath67 of their table 2 .",
    "the two codes have some model differences . for the elc code",
    ", one can simultaneously fit the observed rv points , giving additional sensitivity to @xmath68 and direct estimates of the component masses .",
    "however , the code fits normalized light curves for each band separately , ignoring the instantaneous colors and observed magnitude . when searching high - quality data for the minimum near a correct physical model , this normalization should not affect the fit values and insulates the results from systematic interband photometry errors .",
    "the icarus code , in contrast , fits the observed magnitudes directly , using the instantaneous colors and providing estimates of the distance modulus and the extinction .    for the elc modeling ,",
    "we wish to compare with the sh14 results , and so we used the same color table ( kindly shared by j. schroeder ) generated from the phoenix atmosphere models @xcite with an extension to @xmath69 10,000k from the atlas9 atmospheres @xcite .",
    "for the icarus code we collected harris @xmath10 color tables from the phoenix models tabulated at the spanish virtual observatory ( svo2.cab.inta-csis.es ) .",
    "our results are summarized in table [ fits ] and figure [ fitplot ] .",
    "our elc fit to the @xmath10 magnitudes finds parameters similar to those of sh14 , except that their solution lies to the side of a broad minimum ; the global minimum lies at considerably higher @xmath70 , with @xmath71 ( the minimum in their estimated @xmath72 contours is @xmath73 ) .",
    "these @xmath74 values are about twice those reported by sh14 , but the model light curves and residual plots look quite similar to their results across this range of @xmath68 .",
    "these elc photometry fits give much lower temperatures and heating powers than allowed by our keck spectra .",
    "the icarus photometry fit gives a dramatically different picture , finding @xmath75k , much more consistent with the spectral estimate .",
    "@xmath58 is also much larger .",
    "the fit does not strongly constrain @xmath68 .",
    "the best fits prefer large extinctions ; we fix @xmath76mag , the maximum in this direction from the @xcite models .",
    "the distance modulus is 12.98mag or @xmath77kpc , not inconsistent with the dispersion - measure estimate .",
    "we next explored elc fits of the combined photometry and spectroscopy rv datasets .",
    "since there are only 18 velocity points , these could be overwhelmed by the photometric data .",
    "accordingly , we fit using the rv points 5 times each , effectively increasing the weights to compete with the photometry sets . testing with",
    "only 1 and as many as 10 rv sets revealed that the fit results are insensitive to this choice , but the fitting converged more rapidly to the minima with the increased rv weights .",

    "the points are scaled so that large sizes correspond to lower @xmath86 . with a minimum @xmath87",
    ", we must conclude that the models are inadequate ( or the error bars are underestimated ) .",
    "thus , no particular fit value or formal uncertainty should be believed . nevertheless , the global picture of a pulsar - heated companion is surely correct , and the distribution of best ( albeit inadequate ) fits in parameter space gives a guide to future precise solutions .",
    "first , we note the strong correlation of the `` good '' solutions in the @xmath57@xmath58 plane . recalling that elc fits the normalized light curves",
    ", we can understand that this simply preserves the height of the light - curve peak ; with higher @xmath57 , larger @xmath58 is needed for the same maximum .",
    "the best light - curve fits are indeed for low @xmath57 solutions , as found by sh14 .",
    "however there is a shallower minimum at @xmath88 , consistent with the colors and spectroscopic temperatures .",
    "this local minimum is not evident when fitting only photometry .",
    "the rv data require @xmath68 substantially larger than in the pure photometry fits , but @xmath59 remains poorly constrained , with a wide swath of moderate @xmath86 displaying many local minima",
    ". the small sh14 @xmath89 value is excluded , but the global minimum @xmath90 is quite similar to the best - fit photometry - only solution .",
    "this solution has an unphysically large pulsar mass @xmath91 .",
    "however , if we restrict attention to solutions with @xmath92k , consistent with the spectroscopic classification ( square dots ) , these form a minimum at large inclination @xmath59 , and @xmath93 .",
    "this shallower but well - defined minimum , shown in detail in the upper - panel inset of figure 3 , has a much more modest @xmath94 . in figure 2 , we show the light - curve and rv models for this solution , and the fit residuals .",
    "note the systematic residuals over optical maximum , especially in @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this indicates an incorrect heating model . the correct heating pattern ( likely mediated by an intrabinary shock ; see below ) should have a surface temperature distribution allowing a better match to the light - curve peak .",
    "the rv residuals show similar systematic departures .",
    "we also plot the rv points and model after the same best - fit sinusoid has been removed .",
    "this shows that the basic nonsinusoidal terms in the center - of - light velocity are well detected in our spectra .",
    "this solution has very large @xmath59 , raising the interesting possibility of a pulsar eclipse .",
    "5.2truecm    -0.5truecm",
    "at our large @xmath59 ( `` hit '' ) fit minimum , we expect the companion to eclipse the pulsar for @xmath95 .",
    "the radio - pulse emission is undetected for over half the orbit .",
    "however , the ionized companion winds of rb and black - widow pulsars generally prevent radio - pulse detection for sight lines passing well outside the companion roche lobe , so this alone does not indicate true eclipse .",
    "we have re - examined the 17.0ks _ cxo _ acis exposure of psr j2215 + 5135 ( obsid = 12466 ) , starting on mjd 55697.1821 and covering 1.14 orbits . as noted by @xcite",
    ", there is a clear shallow modulation with a minimum at pulsar superior conjunction @xmath96 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "this shallow modulation might be best interpreted as variable viewing of an x - ray emitting intrabinary shock .",
    "a powerful intrabinary shock can also produce gev lat photons @xcite .",
    "however , since an appreciable fraction of the object s gamma - ray flux is pulsed , we can select the magnetospheric component and search for a true pulsar eclipse .",
    "unfortunately , as for many rb msps , the wind obscuration and @xmath97 fluctuations make radio timing very difficult . at present ,",
    "the best ephemeris available is that of @xcite , valid mjd 5534655911 , about a fifth of the lat mission to date .",
    "we selected 10,951 @xmath9830gev pass 7 reprocessed ` source class ' lat photons within this date window and within @xmath99 of the pulsar .",
    "we compute weights @xmath100 , the probability of being pulsar photons , with the lat tool _",
    "gtsrcprob _ using the @xcite source spectrum parameters and the local background model ; the mean source probability was @xmath101 .",
    "the spin - phase @xmath102 weighted light curve shows two peaks consistent with 2pc results ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 relative to the radio - pulse peak ) .",
    "if we extrapolate this ephemeris to the full lat dataset , the peaks are lost .",
    "we select @xmath105 windows centered on the 2pc pulse peaks , to obtain events most dominated by magnetospheric emission .",
    "other phases represent pulsed bridge flux , unpulsed flux from the intrabinary shock ( if any ) , and unmodeled background emission .",
    "the middle panel shows the weighted binary light curve from the peak phase window ; intriguingly , the minimum bin is at @xmath106 , pulsar superior conjunction .",
    "the full spin - phase light curve shows no strong eclipse .",
    "this suggests an additional uneclipsed gamma - ray component .",
    "binning clearly affects the minimum s appearance , so we desire an unbinned test for the eclipse significance . for an eclipse width @xmath107",
    ", we form the test statistic @xmath108             + \\sigma_2 { \\rm log}(1-w_i ) , \\eqno(2)\\ ] ] where the first sum is over the uneclipsed window and the second is over the eclipse window .",
    "exposure variations are already very small ( @xmath109% in the binned light curve ) , but the likelihood ratio test used here is insensitive to even these , since the variations are common to both the null and eclipse scenarios . to estimate the probability distribution of this statistic , we scrambled weights among the pulse peak photons and recomputed ts 10,000 times . at @xmath110 ,",
    "we find a chance probability of 0.080 ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "however , the companion wind and photon opacity may widen the gamma - ray eclipse .",
    "indeed , somewhat wider eclipses , to @xmath112 , show larger significance .",
    "the best detection is at @xmath113 , illustrated in the histogram at right , with a 0.7% ( @xmath114 , single trial ) probability of a false - positive detection .",
    "this is intriguing , but hardly definitive .",
    "however , an improved radio ephemeris should provide a factor of @xmath115 more photons and better pulse phase isolation , allowing a sensitive test for a magnetospheric ( pulse phased ) eclipse .",
    "our spectroscopic study of the rb msp j2215 + 5135 does not support the inference , based on companion light - curve - shape fits , that it is a particularly massive pulsar .",
    "instead , the results suggest a modest @xmath116 ns mass . however , the present fit is based on a clearly inadequate heating model assuming direct ( x - ray ) pulsar illumination .",
    "of course , for all viable elc model fits the heating flux is much larger than the @xmath117 of the _ cxo _ observation .",
    "indeed , as found for psr j13113430 ( romani , filippenko , & cenko 2015 ) , we find that the heating power into the companion solid angle is a large fraction of the spin - down flux ( figure [ fitplot ] , bottom ) ; we argue that this indicates indirect heating by emission reprocessed in an intrabinary shock .    with the present direct heating model ,",
    "the fits are inadequate and the critical binary inclination @xmath59 is not robustly determined . accordingly , the fit masses are indicative only , and the statistical errors are not useful . there is a clear lesson here : with an inappropriate physical model , simple elc fits to only the light - curve shape can deliver fit minima far from the true solution . using the observed colors , as in icarus ,",
    "certainly helps , but spectroscopic constraints are also essential .",
    "of course , amendment of the physical model should greatly improve the fit quality and may allow photometry - only solutions with high - quality data .",
    "our temperature - constrained fits do suggest that the system is viewed nearly edge - on .",
    "if so , this presents the interesting possibility that the pulsar magnetosphere will be eclipsed by the companion .",
    "limited by the radio ephemeris available , present evidence for such eclipses is suggestive , but not definitive .",
    "however , additional radio data and further analysis of the _ fermi _ lat photons can produce a strong test of the eclipse hypothesis . if well measured , the width and spectrum of the pulsed flux eclipse can provide an important new tomographic probe of the msp magnetosphere and of the evaporative companion wind .",
