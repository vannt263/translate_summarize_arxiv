    "over the past few years , considerable interest has focused on systems of coupled chain conductors .",
    "early theoretical studies of heisenberg ladders ( appropriate for the strongly interacting , non - itinerant half - filled limit ) revealed an interesting odd / even effect.@xcite   if the number of legs of the ladder , @xmath0 , is even , the system is expected to be a spin - liquid with a singlet ground state and a ( spin ) gap to the lowest lying excitations carrying angular momentum . for odd @xmath0 ,",
    "the ground state has quasi - long - range antiferromagnetic order and a set of gapless spin - wave excitations , which puts it in the universality class of the single spin-@xmath5 heisenberg chain .",
    "recent progress in the experimental preparation of relatively isolated spin ladders has begun to probe some of this rich physics and appears to have verified these expectations for @xmath1.@xcite    the behavior of _ doped _ ladders , i.e. those with itinerant charge carriers , is much richer .",
    "particular theoretical attention has been paid to the case @xmath6 , the two - leg ladder.@xciteearly motivation stemmed from the possibility of realizing a concrete example of resonating valence bond ( rvb ) ideas.@xcite   according to this line of thought , since the two - leg heisenberg ladder is a spin liquid , the doped carriers experience a short - range attractive interaction , leading to pairing and the persistence of the spin gap .",
    "such behavior is indeed observed in simulations of two - chain hubbard@xcite and @xmath7-@xmath8 models,@xcite  which push the current computational limits of numerical methods working directly at zero temperature .",
    "subsequent work by numerous authors has since demonstrated the existence of such a spin gap phase for low dopings by controlled analytical methods in weak coupling.@xcite   this weak - coupling approach has the additional advantage that it provides a full picture of the phase diagram , even away from half - filling .    in this paper",
    ", we extend this analysis to more general @xmath0-chain hubbard models.@xcite   such an extension is useful in two respects .",
    "first , it allows a determination of the phase diagram for any small value of @xmath0 , thereby elucidating the physics of doped spin liquids , the even / odd effect , and geometrical frustration .",
    "furthermore , our equations allow a complete interpolation between one and two dimensions ( along a particular path in parameter space ",
    "see below ) .",
    "an understanding of such a dimensional crossover@xcite  is a crucial first step in interpreting experiments in _ quasi_-one - dimensional conductors .    to determine the behavior in the weak interaction limit",
    ", we employ a generalization of the renormalization group ( rg ) developed in ref .",
    "( the extension to the particular case @xmath9 has already by studied by arrigoni@xcite ) .",
    "this provides a systematic basis for treating the logarithmic divergences arising in a naive perturbative analysis .",
    "coupled with the technique of bosonization , the primary output of the rg is a `` gap '' function @xmath3 , describing pairing and the relative phase among the various spin and charge modes in the system . in the limit of large @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath3 becomes identical to the gap function defined in the conventional bcs theory of superconductivity , and one may thereby connect our results directly with higher dimensional analogues .",
    "the rg also determines the zero temperature behavior as the chain length is taken to infinity . because such a system is , for any finite @xmath0 , still one - dimensional , it can not sustain true off - diagonal long - range order , but is instead a generalized luttinger liquid . the particular luttinger liquid phase , within a general classification scheme developed in ref .  also follows from the gap function @xmath3 .",
    "we will use this notation , in which a phase with @xmath10 gapless charge and @xmath11 gapless spin modes is denoted cmsn , in what follows .",
    "the results of our calculations for positive @xmath12 hubbard chains in the phase diagrams are summarized in figs.[6 - 10 ] .",
    "we emphasize that the phase diagrams are valid for arbitrary filling @xmath11 and transverse hopping @xmath13 except at some specific lines ( see below ) .",
    "first note the proliferation of phases as @xmath0 increases from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "we believe that this complexity persists even in the @xmath16 limit ( but see below ) .",
    "the crossover to two dimensions is thus highly nontrivial .",
    "secondly , despite the repulsive interactions , the majority of phases exhibit some degree of reduction of gapless spin modes , i.e. pairing .",
    "the symmetry of the pair wavefunction is in most cases consistent with a d - wave form . unlike the two - chain case",
    ", however , as @xmath0 is increased , gapless spin modes exist due to the presence of nodes in the pair wavefunction . under different circumstances , as can be seen from figs.[6 - 10 ] , both @xmath17 and @xmath18 states appear .",
    "a number of special results are obtained for particular small values of @xmath0 . in the case",
    "@xmath9 , the difference between open and periodic boundary conditions is quite pronounced , due to the strong role of frustration ( and consequent absence of particle / hole symmetry ) in the periodic case . as found previously by arrigoni@xcite and schulz,@xcite  this hubbard `` prism '' exhibits a spin gap at half filling , which persists over a range of both particle and hole doping .",
    "an especially surprising effect occurs for @xmath19 with periodic boundary conditions . in certain regions of the phase diagram , ( singlet )",
    "cooper pairs condense , not into the zero center - of - mass momentum state , but rather into the @xmath20 center - of - mass ( quasi-)angular momentum states around the four - chain cylinder .",
    "we therefore call this a cylindrically extended ( cex ) d - wave phase .",
    "preliminary indications of the cex d - wave phase have been found in recent numerical calculations.@xcite    although detailed phase diagrams such as these have only been obtained for @xmath21 , our rg equations are valid for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "they can be easily integrated numerically to any desired accuracy to determine most features of the weak - coupling phase diagram for any @xmath0 . in the limit @xmath16 ,",
    "several connections can be made with other work.@xcite this limit may be taken in several ways .",
    "for the simplest form of our flow equations to remain valid , the interaction strength @xmath12 must be scaled logarithmically to zero as @xmath16 . strictly speaking , then",
    ", these rg equations do not describe truly two - dimensional systems with finite , non - singular , interactions .",
    "the only logarithmic reduction of the domain of validity with increasing @xmath0 suggests , however , that the two - dimensional limit may nevertheless be well approximated in this scheme .",
    "we present arguments that this is indeed the case .",
    "firstly , in the large @xmath0 limit , our rg equations reduce , up to an overall normalization of the interaction strength , to those of shankar,@xcite  derived directly in two dimensions .",
    "second , an extended set of rg equations incorporating additional interactions , which we argue captures completely the two - dimensional limit for small non - zero @xmath12 , can be shown to be equivalent to the previous ones for interactions with non - singular momentum dependence at the fermi surface .    based on these analyses , we expect our rg equations to contain a complete description of the dimensional crossover in the weak - interaction limit . in this limit ,",
    "explicit analysis of the @xmath22 correction terms show that all the pairing instabilities occur only at very low temperatures , @xmath23 .",
    "feedback of the forward - scattering interactions into the cooper channel , responsible for the pairing instabilities in the smaller ladder systems at weak coupling , is therefore insufficient to produce superconductivity in the two - dimensional limit .",
    "we conclude that _ strong _ and/or nearly - nested interactions are necessary to explain superconductivity in 2d repulsive hubbard systems .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the n - chain hubbard model , its weak - coupling limit , and a compact current - algebra notation for the allowed interactions . in sec .",
    "iii , the rg equations are derived using the operator product expansion to one loop order , and the numerical method used to study these equations is explained . in sec .",

    "v to determine the phase diagrams of 3- and 4-chain systems .",
    "our analysis of the 2d limit is given in sec .",
    "vi , and implications for numerics and experiments are discussed in sec .",
    "four appendixes give further details of current algebra methods , rg equations for umklapp couplings , initial values of coupling constants for the hubbard models , and klein factors needed for the bosonization calculations .",

    "when interactions are included , this gives rise to modifications of the remaining effective action of o(@xmath58 , @xmath59 ) , negligible relative to the bare @xmath60 couplings for @xmath61 .",
    "we denote the number of remaining partially filled bands by @xmath62 .",

    "furthermore , the number of allowed terms continues to decrease as the rg proceeds to lower energies , since the band curvature @xmath252 effectively grows under rescaling .      in the large @xmath0 limit , therefore , additional ( shifted ) interactions _ are _ present at weak but finite couplings , but do not modify the rg equations or their analysis as presented above . at @xmath526 ,",

    "specifically , these terms can only begin to affect the flows once the cooper interactions have themselves renormalized down to order @xmath22 .",
    "since the @xmath526 flows are logarithmic , this occurs only after a rescaling @xmath527 , so that the characteristic energy gaps ( and critical temperatures ) of any paired states should obey @xmath528 with a prefactor which is not determinable by such coarse arguments .",
    "this exponential decrease of the energy scale for pairing is a signature of the rather robust stability of the generic fermi liquid .",
    "this weak - coupling result , however , does not make any statement about pairing instabilities for _ strong _ repulsive interactions .",
    "non - generic situations can , of course , give rise to much larger energy scales , even at weak coupling .",
    "of particular importance in highly anisotropic repulsively interacting systems is the spin - density - wave instability . because this requires nesting in weak coupling ,",
    "the associated interaction vertices have been thrown out in our calculations .",
    "the principal results of this paper are the @xmath0-chain weak coupling phase diagrams , described in detail for small and large @xmath0 in sections v and vi , respectively .",
    "we now conclude with a discussion of the _ implications _ of these results for both ideal finite @xmath0 systems ( accessible via numerical calculations ) and for true _",
    "quasi_-1d systems , where non - zero inter - ladder couplings need to be taken into account .",
    "numerical calculations have the advantage that direct comparisons with 1d models can be made . recall that each phase is characterized at the simplest level by its number of gapless charge and spin modes .",
    "these numbers can be measured numerically in a number of ways .",
    "most directly , the lowest lying charge and spin excitation energies can be determining by comparing ground state energies ( in , e.g. exact diagonalization or density - matrix rg methods ) with particles added or spins flipped .",
    "such measurements can also be refined to determine the energies for the lowest - lying excitations with a definite _ parity _ , which can be related to the band indices used here .",
    "the _ total number _ of gapless modes ( both charge and spin ) can in principle be extracted alternatively from the coefficient of @xmath529 ( where @xmath530 is the chain length ) in the finite - size correction to the ground - state energy density .",
    "the parity of the ground state and low - lying excited states are also accessible in weak coupling . here",
    "we focus on the c1s0 phase in a 2-chain system as an example .",
    "the parity operator of a 2-chain system is @xmath531 where @xmath532 is the total number of particles in the anti - bonding band .",
    "the parity operator @xmath533 commutes with the hamiltonian , so that parity is a good quantum number . if the ground state is a linear superposition of states with odd / even @xmath532 , it has odd / even parity . in the c1s0 phase ,",
    "if total number of particles is even , @xmath532 is even because electrons pair up in both bands .",
    "therefore , the ground state has even parity .",
    "however , if the total number is odd , the analysis is complicated and remains an open question for further study .",
    "the parities of excited states is determined by commutation relation between the corresponding creation operators and parity operator . the bosonic field operator @xmath534 , which is the only gapless mode in the c1s0 phase , creates a density excitation with momenta @xmath535 .",
    "if we express @xmath532 in terms of the bosonic fields @xmath536 it is easy to show that @xmath534 commutes with the parity operator .",
    "this implies that the excited state has the same parity as the ground state . in other words ,",
    "the excitation carries even parity .",
    "consequently , numerical calculations should find a _",
    "charge gap _ in the odd parity channel , despite the exsistence of a gapless charge mode with even parity .",
    "a simple test is the correlation function @xmath537 where @xmath538 .",
    "since @xmath539 , @xmath540 has only odd - parity ( relative to the ground state ) intermediate states , and should therefore decay _ exponentially _ , @xmath541 !    it is often more convenient to compute correlation functions rather than ground state energies ( indeed , in a monte carlo calculation , this is essentially the only option ) . in this case",
    ", the information that can be most reliably assayed is the presence or absence of charge and spin gaps .",
    "if there is a true gap in either sector , the corresponding correlators are expected to decay exponentially in space . to probe the charge sector ,",
    "the correlators of interest are those of the density @xmath542 and the pair field @xmath543 . in the spin sector , the corresponding operator is simply the spin @xmath544 . in principle , a detailed examination of the fourier content of the correlations should identify the fermi momenta of the gapless spin and charge modes ( even more information than their number ) , but this is quite difficult in practice due to finite - size limitations imposed by the numerics .",

    "the discussion will be kept at a general level , using only scaling considerations .",
    "we take as a model a two- or three - dimensional regular array of @xmath0-chain ladders , the precise geometry of which is not crucial , although special cases resulting in fermi - surface nesting will not be addressed . a microscopic electronic model for such an array would involve the hopping amplitudes and interactions both on and between the ladders .",
    "we will assume that the former are of the hubbard form studied in the previous sections .",

    "two of these are of particular importance : two - particle hopping processes , in which two fermions are simultaneously transferred from one ladder to a neighbor , and four - particle `` pair - density '' interactions , in which fermions interact energetically on neighboring ladders in a manner quartic in the density , but no charge is transferred",
