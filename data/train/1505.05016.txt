    "the class of monotone systems , which comprises dynamical systems that preserve an order on the state space , is of significant interest both due to the strong theoretical properties of such systems and for their suitability for modeling numerous physical systems .",
    "areas in which monotonicity properties have frequently been exploited include population dynamics  @xcite , consensus protocols  @xcite , and communication systems  @xcite , emphasizing the breadth of applicability of monotone systems .",
    "the seminal papers of hirsch , beginning with  @xcite , established a powerful general theory for monotone systems , demonstrating that the order - preservation property endows such systems with a rich mathematical structure .",
    "a thorough review of this theory can be found in  @xcite , which details in particular the powerful results of generic convergence that can be obtained .",
    "it is well - known that delay differential equations become monotone under the property of quasimonotonicity  @xcite . in the modeling of many physical problems ,",
    "time - delays play an important role and can have a significant effect on the system behavior . in particular , time - delays can often destabilize a system and prevent convergence from occurring .",
    "it is therefore an important problem to ascertain how the presence of time - delays might affect the behavior of systems that are asymptotically stable in the undelayed setting .",
    "quasimonotonicity alone is not in general sufficient to be able to guarantee global asymptotic stability .",
    "furthermore , despite the monotonicity property , direct comparisons between the trajectories of the undelayed and the delayed system are in general nontrivial to establish , as the presence of delays can significantly change the behavior of trajectories .",
    "therefore , there have been a number of attempts to resolve this problem for particular types of systems , through use of monotonicity combined with other system properties . for linear systems there exist strong results , many of which are based upon versions of the perron ",
    "frobenius theorem , guaranteeing delay - independent global asymptotic stability and even exponential convergence  rates  @xcite . in recent interesting works ,",
    "these results have been extended to nonlinear systems satisfying properties of homogeneity  @xcite and subhomogeneity  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in  @xcite that the subhomogeneity condition can be sufficiently strong to imply delay - independent stability even without monotonicity . however , since homogeneity is closely linked to linearity , it is desirable to provide extensions , as was done in the planar case in  @xcite , to a more general nonlinear monotone setting .",
    "within this paper we investigate what conclusions can be drawn about the behavior of the delayed system using the quasimonotonicity property alone , together with simple properties of the undelayed system .",
    "in particular , one of our results is to show that whenever the system without any delay admits a solution that is convergent and is unbounded in all components in negative time , then global asymptotic stability is guaranteed for arbitrary bounded delays , which can be heterogeneous and time - varying .",
    "this follows from a more general result derived in the paper , which explicitly constructs delay - independent regions of attraction in terms of convergent trajectories of the corresponding undelayed system .",
    "the significance of these regions is that they allow us to generate proofs of global asymptotic stability for various classes of systems , recovering also known delay - independent stability results for linear / homogeneous / subhomogeneous systems and convergence for systems with vector fields that are negative at a prescribed point .",

    "we discuss how our approaches connect with other results in the literature and provide also additional examples where delay - independent stability can be deduced .",
    "lemmas  [ st511 ] and  [ sc522 ] are important classical results that have been used in a number of interesting studies to prove delay - independent global asymptotic stability for linear , homogeneous , and subhomogeneous monotone systems . these results are based on the fact that in such systems global asymptotic stability of the undelayed system implies the existence of arbitrarily large points where the vector field is negative .",
    "lemma  [ theo1 ] shows that such points can be determined under weaker system assumptions .",
    "even though these points ( denoted as  @xmath69 ) can in general be difficult to characterize algorithmically , their significance lies in the fact that they allow to prove delay - independent global asymptotic stability for broader classes of systems .    the following corollary and its proof make the connection with lemmas  [ st511 ] and  [ sc522 ] more explicit .",
    "the corollary shows that when a point is known where the vector field is negative , then the delay - independent region of attraction obtained from lemma  [ theo1 ] has a simple form , recovering arbitrarily closely that obtained from lemmas  [ st511 ] and  [ sc522 ] .",
