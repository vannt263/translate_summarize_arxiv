    "according to einstein s theory of gravity there are a number of constraints on the values of the characteristic functions of compact objects in the hydrostatic equilibrium state .",
    "these bounds are obtained directly from the einstein s equations and are independent of the detailed structure and the equation of state of the stars .",
    "they are based on some acceptable assumptions : the star is spherically symmetric and static , the matter in the star is described by its non  negative mass density and the pressure and that the mean density in any arbitrary radius , does not increase outward from the center of star which is consistent with any realistic star model . in the framework of newtonian theory of gravity , chandrasekhar has investigated these bounds in his famous book @xcite .",
    "his results include some inequalities for the central pressure , the potential energy , the mean values of gravity and pressure and so on .",
    "the general relativistic extension of these bounds is studied in @xcite .",
    "the authors obtained the allowed bounds on the interior geometry , the density and pressure profile and the internal compactness , defined as @xmath0 in which @xmath1 is the mass contained within the radius @xmath2 , of a star .",
    "the most famous of these bounds is the buchdahl  bondi inequality @xcite .",
    "it is an upper bound on the total compactness of a static spherically symmetric fluid in the form of @xmath3 .",
    "the modified form of this bound is derived in the presence of cosmological constant in @xcite and for a charged gravitational object in @xcite .    here",
    "we shall study how a positive cosmological constant , @xmath4 , effects on the other constraints of a general relativistic object which are derived in @xcite .",
    "we shall see that such a generalization is not trivial and requires a detailed calculation .",
    "consider a spherically symmetric distribution of a prefect fluid in the equilibrium state in the presence of cosmological constant . denoting the pressure and the mass density of the fluid by @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively . to have a realistic star model",
    "we further assume that the average density interior to the radius r , @xmath7 is a non increasing function of the radial coordinate .",
    "we shall see that these assumptions lead to some inequalities for the physical quantities describing the star .",
    "the spherically symmetric static line element may be written in the general form : @xmath8    denoting the radial derivative by prime , the first equation of stellar structure is the newtonian definition of mass in terms of density : @xmath9 the other is tolman  oppenheimer ",
    "volkov equation : @xmath10 this equation is obtained by combining the time  time and radial  radial components of einsteins equations .    from the two latter equations , one can get a fundamental equation as follows : @xmath11'\\ ] ] which for a fluid with a given equation of state , @xmath12 , can determine the equilibrium configuration of star .    to obtain the complete solution , one also needs to find the geometrical structure of the space  time .",
    "this can be easily done using the conservation of energy ",
    "momentum tensor and einsteins equations . the energy ",
    "momentum conservation for the perfect fluid gives : @xmath13 while the time  time component of the einsteins equations leads to : @xmath14    as an example consider a hypothetical star with constant density , @xmath15",
    ". then these equations are exactly solvable@xcite . denoting the variables by zero index for this special solution",
    ", one has : @xmath16 @xmath17 the central pressure is given by : @xmath18 the central pressure becomes infinity at @xmath19 .",
    "thus there is some bounds on the mass to radius ratio of a uniform density star which depends on it s radius .",
    "the allowed values of internal compactness is expressed by the modified buchdahl theorem in the presence of cosmological constant which is obtained for a general mass density in @xcite as follows : @xmath20 as a result of this theorem a star of fixed radius which it s mass does nt satisfy the above bound , is not in hydrostatic equilibrium and so if it has enough mass can collapses to a desitter  schwarzchild black hole .    in this paper",
    "we shall prove some useful theorems on different quantities describing the equilibrium configuration of a compact object . in doing this",
    "we make the following assumptions :    * \\i ) _",
    "einstein s general relativity is valid . _ * \\ii ) _ there is a positive cosmological constant , @xmath4 . _ * \\iii ) _ the star density @xmath21 is non - negative everywhere .",
    "_ * \\iv ) _ the star pressure @xmath22 is non - negative everywhere .",
    "_ * \\v ) _ the star is spherically symmetric and static . _ * \\vi ) _ since in the tolman  oppenheimer ",
    "volkov equation the newtonian mass appears , the average density should be defined as @xmath23 .",
    "we have to use the flat volume because in taking the average of any quantity the same measure ( @xmath24 ) should be used in the numerator and in the denominator . for a realistic star , we assume that @xmath25 and thus @xmath26 .",
    "and @xmath22 , equation ( [ tov ] ) shows that , it is reasonable to assume @xmath22 is non - increasing on average , while the cosmological constant is not very large .",
    "in addition we suppose that the fluid allows an equation of state in the form @xmath12 and assume that sound can propagate in the fluid , i.e. the sound velocity squared @xmath27 is non - negative . as a result , @xmath25 . ] _",
    "since the density and pressure are positive quantities a look at equation ( [ tov ] ) , we have : @xmath28 this can be used to prove the following theorem .    for any equilibrium configuration ,",
    "the function @xmath29 does nt increase outward , provided the assumptions i , ii , iii , iv , v and vi are valid .",
    "* proof : *    considering inequality ( [ ine ] ) , we find that : @xmath30 @xmath31 after some calculations and using @xmath32 , we obtain : @xmath33 this proves the theorem .",
    "if @xmath34 denotes the central pressure , ( [ fun ] ) leads to : @xmath35 where @xmath36 which shows a lower bound on @xmath37 .",
    "there is another way to get a different lower bound on the central pressure @xcite . integrating equation ( [ ine ] ) from the center of star to it s surface where the pressure drops to zero , one obtains",
    ": @xmath38 introducing the new variable @xmath39 , we find that : @xmath40 using the power series of @xmath41 , we get : @xmath42 @xmath43 the first term is positive and the second term can be integrated by parts .",
    "this gives : @xmath44 again the second term is positive , which shows that : @xmath45 the above terms can be summed up leading to : @xmath46 where @xmath47 comparing equations ( [ bou1 ] ) and ( [ bou2 ] ) one gets : @xmath48 it has to be noted that for a typical star like sun and for the value of the cosmological constant obtained from the acceleration of the universe , @xmath49 and @xmath50 terms are very small and the @xmath51 terms can be expanded .",
    "then it can be simply seen that @xmath52 is several order of magnitude larger than @xmath53 .    in the presence of cosmological constant @xmath54 ,",
    "i.e. the time",
    " time component of the space ",
    "time metric is less than or equal to that of the case with a constant density everywhere , provided the assumptions i , ii , iii , iv , v and vi are valid .",
    "* proof : *    combining equations ( [ mass]),([tov ] ) and ( [ com ] ) , it is easy to show that : @xmath55'=\\frac{\\sqrt{f}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{2m}{r}-\\frac{1}{3}\\lambda r^2}}\\left ( \\frac{m}{r^3 } \\right ) ' \\leq 0 \\label{manfi}\\ ] ] so that : @xmath56 integrating from @xmath2 to @xmath57 leads to : @xmath58 remember that the average density inside any radius @xmath2 is non increasing , hence : @xmath59 and thus : @xmath60 performing the integration and substituting @xmath61 from the exterior solution ( i.e. schwarzschield",
    " desitter solution ) , finally we get : @xmath62 where the right hand side is @xmath63 , ( see equation ( [ comp ] ) ) , and thus @xmath64 .    writing this inequality for the center of star",
    "we have @xmath65 . using the relation @xmath66",
    "one gets the modified buchdahl theorem in the presence of cosmological constant , equation ( [ vay ] ) , which is obtained in @xcite . to see this , note that squaring the relation @xmath66 we have :",
    "@xmath67 which , using the fact that the cosmological constant is positive , is valid provided that : @xmath68 which leads to the equation([vay ] ) .    using this theorem",
    "one can see that there is an upper bound on the @xmath69 .",
    "the relations ( [ tov ] ) and ( [ manfi ] ) can be expressed respectively as : @xmath70 and @xmath71 using equation ( [ 1 ] ) , one can eliminate @xmath72 in the relation ( [ 2 ] ) to obtain the following result : @xmath73    another result is the existence of a lower limit on the pressure of a star at any arbitrary radius . integrating equation",
    "( [ com ] ) from @xmath2 to @xmath57 and using equation ( [ asl ] ) one has : @xmath74",
    "which can be written in terms of @xmath75 and @xmath76 as follows : @xmath77 by adding and subtracting @xmath78 in the numerator of integrand , the above integral can be decomposed into two terms .",
    "the first term is integrable and the second term , because of equation ( [ had ] ) has an upper limit .",
    "thus : @xmath79 and after a simple integration and noting that @xmath80 and that @xmath81 is decreasing we have : @xmath82 @xmath83 \\label{mordamazinhameformul}\\ ] ]    for a stellar object , one has : @xmath84 \\label{compact}\\ ] ] provided the assumptions i , ii , iii , iv , v and vi are valid .",

    "it represents an upper bound on the internal compactness of a star in the presence of a cosmological constant . to understand this inequality better ,",
    "consider a realistic model for a star in which there is a core represented by it s mass @xmath100 and radius @xmath101 .",
    "outside the core , assume that the density is below a given density @xmath102 and the equation of state is known only at this region . according to the above theorem",
    ", the total mass of the star is bound . to see this note that the lower bound of @xmath100",
    "is @xmath103 and ( [ compact ] ) shows that it s upper bound is given by : @xmath104\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the pressure at the core boundary .",
    "since the values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 are restricted , the total mass which is a continuous function , @xmath106 , is also bound .",
    "moreover the relation ( [ it ] ) implies that the pressure at any radius has a maximum value which depends on the mass contained within that radius .",
    "one can see this , by multiplying equation ( [ it ] ) by @xmath107 and doing some simplifications : @xmath108\\ ] ]",
    "the theorems proved for a static spherically symmetric stars in the presence of a positive cosmological constant , enabled us to obtain upper and lower bounds for some of the physical properties of the star .",
    "these inequalities include upper bounds for the central pressure , the pressure profile and also for the internal compactness .    to see how the presence of a positive cosmological constant changes these bounds , let us to investigate the @xmath52 bound on the central pressure defined by equation ( [ b2 ] ) .",
    "the dependence of the central pressure on the internal compactness and the cosmological constant is plotted in figure ( [ f1 ] ) .     in terms of the internal compactness and the cosmological constant .",
    "the acceptable region is the upper region of the surface .",
