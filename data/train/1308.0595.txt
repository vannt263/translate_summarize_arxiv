    "blazars are radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with relativistic jets viewed at small angles to the earth s line of sight .",

    "then , we ran gtlike and generated a weekly ( 7-day binned ) light curve for pks  0426@xmath3380 . finally , when calculating daily fluxes and power - law indices for pks  0426@xmath3380 , only the source normalization and power - law slope were left free , along with the normalizations of the two diffuse emission components , while all the other parameters were fixed to the values obtained with gtlike for the entire 4.7-year dataset to avoid unreasonably large errors .    to construct the @xmath1-ray spectrum of the source , we first selected energy intervals chosen as 11 octaves ranging from 0.1 to 204.8gev ( namely , 0.10.2 , 0.20.4 , ... , 102.4204.8gev ) . in the xml source model ,",
    "the normalizations of the surrounding sources within 10@xmath28 and of the galactic and extragalactic diffuse emission components were set free , while all the other spectral parameters were fixed to the values derived for the lat data accumulated for the selected period .",

    "in figure 1 we present the lat count map of ultraclean events ( a subset of the clean class with the highest probability of being @xmath1 rays ) with 5300gev energies around pks  0426@xmath3380 .",
    "one can clearly see that the two vhe photons , with energies 134gev and 122gev , coincide with the position of the blazar ( angular separations from the blazar of @xmath30 ) and are well inside the point spread function ( psf ) of _ fermi_-lat .",
    "a detailed summary of the vhe events , including their precise localizations and arrival times , is given in table  1 .",
    "based on the gtsrcprob results ( see table  1 ) , we calculated the null hypothesis probability that both events originate from foreground / background ( galactic / extragalactic ) diffuse emission components , or other surrounding 2fgl sources rather than pks  0426@xmath3380 , using fisher s method and obtained @xmath31 .",
    "we can therefore reject the null hypothesis at the @xmath4 confidence level ( cl ) , and claim robustly that at least one of the two detected vhe @xmath1 rays originates from pks  0426@xmath3380 , making it the most distant vhe emitter known to date .",
    "although the two vhe events are classified as ultraclean ones , we further visually inspected the tracks in the lat tracker subsystem after the point of pair conversion . the first event converted at the top layer of a tower and the long straight paths of the converted electron - positron pairs were nicely tracked .",
    "the second event converted at the third layer of the tracker and similarly showed no unusual signatures .",

    "fermi_-lat  light curve of pks  0426@xmath3380  within the energy range @xmath32gev , along with the arrival times of @xmath1 rays with energies above 50 gev .",
    "it is clear that the two vhe events were detected during high states of the source .",
    "interestingly however , the vhe detections did not coincide with the flux maxima of the flaring epochs .",
    "complex structures of the source light curve , with multiple peaks within each flaring state , preclude us however from speculating if the vhe photons preceded or followed the flux maxima at lower photon energies . to further investigate the temporal and spectral variations within @xmath33 days of the two vhe events , in figure  3 we show the daily changes of the flux and power - law index for the source . in neither case",
    "did the @xmath32gev flux dramatically increase on the day of the vhe detection . on the other hand",
    ", a significant spectral hardening can be noticed on the day of the first vhe detection , but not on the day of the second one .",
    "figure  4 shows the @xmath1-ray spectrum of pks  0426@xmath3380  during the most energetic flare , derived from the accumulated _",
    "fermi_-lat  data between met 280000000 and 302000000 ( see figure  2 ) . no high - energy cutoff expected from the ebl - related attenuation of",
    "the @xmath1-ray continuum seems to be present up to several tens of gev , although the highest energy ( @xmath34gev ) datapoint is a 95% cl upper limit due to the limited photon statistics ( corresponding to a single net photon ) .",
    "we found that a broken power - law model of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37gev maximized the likelihood , and this is also drawn in figure  4 .",
    "we emphasize that the presented spectrum was derived from the _",
    "fermi_-lat  data accumulated over @xmath8 months .",
    "hence , keeping in mind the large - amplitude variability of the source in @xmath1 rays , one has to be very careful in interpreting spectral features apparent in the figure , like for example the discontinuity around 10gev ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for other examples ) .",
    "based on the observed sed , we generated the ebl - corrected spectra of the source ( figure  4 ) using two different ebl models @xcite .",
    "the de - absorbed spectra seem to reveal an additional high - energy flat - spectrum component above several tens of gev ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the significance of this feature is marginal and , more importantly , model dependent .",
    "nonetheless , the results obtained do suggest that pks  0426@xmath3380  is a very promising target for future follow - up studies with imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) such as h.e.s.s .",
    "ii and cta @xcite .",
    "three blazars classified as fsrqs have previously been detected in the vhe range by iacts , 3c  279 ( @xmath38 ; * ? ? ? * ) , pks  1510@xmath3089 ( @xmath39 ; * ? ? ?",

    "the observational results presented in this letter therefore establish pks  0426@xmath3380 , which is located at @xmath43 , as the most distant vhe emitter observed to date .",
    "we note that the redshift of pks  0426@xmath3380  is just around the horizon for @xmath6gev @xmath1 rays ( namely , ebl - related optical depth of the universe @xmath44 ) as recently determined by _",
    "fermi_-lat  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and figure 1 therein ) , hence the vhe detection from the @xmath43 blazar is not unreasonable .    as mentioned previously , the observed luminosity of the broad [ mgii ] line in the optical spectrum of pks  0426@xmath3380  is @xmath45ergs@xmath13 @xcite , implying a blr luminosity @xmath46ergs@xmath13 using the scaling relation @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "spectral modeling of the accretion - related continuum in the source @xcite yields @xmath48 .",
    "based on the [ mgii ] line fwhm of @xmath49kms@xmath13 , and the observed @xmath50-band magnitude of 18.6 ( assuming negligible starlight contamination ) , we derived a slightly larger value of @xmath51 , using the scaling relations from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the eddington luminosity @xmath52ergs@xmath13 , the ratio @xmath14 , and the accretion rate at the level of @xmath53 ( assuming the standard bolometric correction factor @xmath54 for the @xmath55-band source luminosity @xmath56ergs@xmath13 ) .",
    "the derived high accretion rate is consistent with pks  0426@xmath3380  being a fsrq .    the intense @xmath1-ray emission of fsrqs is widely thought to arise due to inverse - compton up - scattering of low - energy photons generated outside of a jet by ultra - relativistic electrons accelerated within the innermost parts of the relativistic outflows @xcite .",
    "if this blazar emission zone is located at sub - parsec distances from the central black hole , as is often anticipated in the literature , then the abundant circum - nuclear photon fields provided by the blr and/or hot dust are expected to attenuate the vhe blazar emission substantially due to the photon - photon pair production , leading to the formation of breaks and cut - offs in the @xmath1-ray continua of fsrqs ( see in this context the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed sharp break ( @xmath57 ) at @xmath8gev would be understood by a scenario with the blazar emission zone deep within the blr .",
    "however , we note again that the @xmath1-ray spectrum when corrected for the cosmological absorption showed a flattened shape at energies above 10 gev . this flat component , if connected to the sub - tev range , should come from another emission region outside the blr to avoid @xmath58 attenuation .",
    "care must be taken not to over - interpret such high - energy features ( flattening ) in unfolded blazar spectra constructed using _",
    "fermi_-lat  data accumulated over longer periods of time , since those may simply arise due to averaging over different activity states characterized by different spectral properties ( see the related discussion and analysis in * ? ? ?",
    "* concerning the well - known bl lac object mrk  501 ) . still , the results presented here for pks  0426@xmath3380  are in principle consistent with the emergence of an additional very high - energy flat - spectrum component during the flaring states of the source .",
    "one possibility for the production of such a component could be electron pile - up at the highest energies due to the efficient and continuous acceleration processes limited only by the radiative losses @xcite .",
    "another possibility could be an additional hadronic emission component dominating occasionally the source spectrum in the vhe range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , assuming that pks  0426@xmath3380  generates cosmic rays with energies above 10eev , or @xmath1 rays above 30tev , the induced intergalactic cascade emission may provide a non - negligible contribution within the vhe range of the source spectrum @xcite .",
    "the time scale of the expected delay between the production of the primary ultra - high energy cosmic rays/@xmath1-ray photons and the observed re - processed vhe signal is @xmath59days and @xmath60days for the photon and the cosmic - ray induced cascade emission at @xmath43 , respectively , where @xmath55 is the intergalactic magnetic field strength , @xmath61 is the mean free path of the pair creation , and @xmath62 is the mean free path of the bethe - heitler process @xcite . rather speculatively ,",
    "if there are axion - like particles , photon and axion mixing in the intergalactic medium may in addition enhance the ebl - absorbed photon flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
