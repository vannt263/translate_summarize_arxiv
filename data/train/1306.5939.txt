    "a classic problem in the field of hydraulics is determining the distribution of flow rates and pressures inside a given piping network for fixed inlet conditions .",
    "many practical fluid networks such as municipal water delivery have turbulent flow and thus a nonlinear resistance making their analytical solution difficult . in 1936 , a structural engineer named hardy cross revolutionized the analysis of hydraulic networks by developing a systematic iterative method by which one could reliably solve nonlinear network problems by hand calculation @xcite .    while analysis of such hydraulic networks is now considered routine with computer techniques , the problem",
    "can once again become intractable if one considers networks filled with a fluid comprised of multiple phases or constituents .",
    "analysis of such networks is of interest because in a number of application it has been observed that the phase distribution within the network may exhibit unsteady or non - unique flow .",
    "such heterogeneous distribution of phase within network flows has been studied at a variety of scales . at the micro - scale",
    ", the flow of droplets or bubbles through microfluidic networks can demonstrate bistabilty and spontaneous oscillations  @xcite .",
    "these nonlinearities have been exploited by researchers who have demonstrated microfluidic memory , logic , and control devices  @xcite . on the macro - scale ,",
    "models of magma flow with either temperature - dependent viscosity  @xcite or volatile - dependent viscosity  @xcite have shown the existence of multiple solutions on the pressure - flow curve which can lead to spontaneous oscillations .",
    "another network that can exhibit complex behavior is microvascular blood flow .",
    "nobel prize winner august krogh noted the heterogeneity of blood flow in the webbed feet of frogs in the early 1920 s  @xcite . in the _ anatomy and physiology of capillaries _ he wrote  @xcite    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ in single capillaries the flow may become retarded or accelerated from no visible cause ; in capillary anastomoses the direction of flow may change from time to time .",

    "vasomotion has often been assumed to be the cause for oscillations in the micro - circulation  @xcite . while the importance of vasomotion can not be denied ,",
    "there is significant evidence that fluctuations in cell distributions in microvascular networks can be due to inherent instabilities  @xcite .",
    "there are two fundamental phenomena in two - phase flow networks which differ from their single phase counterparts and lead to complicated behavior .",
    "the first effect is that the effective viscosity or flow resistance in a single pipe is often a nonlinear function of the fraction of the different fluids in the pipe .",
    "the second effect is that in two fluid systems , it is commonly observed that the phase fraction after a diverging node is different in the two downstream branches . in 2007",
    "we ( jbg and njk ) proved that if the viscosity is a nonlinear function of fluid fraction then multiple stable equilibrium states may exist  @xcite .",
    "further we proved that both phase separation at a node and nonlinear viscosity can lead to the emergence of spontaneous oscillations . in recent experiments",
    ", we ( jbg and bds ) have demonstrated some of these predictions experimentally in simple networks involving two newtonian fluids of different viscosity  @xcite . in one set of experiments we demonstrated bistability via nonlinear resistance  @xcite and in the other bistability via phase separation  @xcite .",
    "these experiments showed that multiple equilibria in networks is possible without fluids with complex rheology .",
    "while our experiments involve simple fluids in a controlled laboratory setting , it is expected that these results may be generalized and found in numerous natural and man - made systems .",
    "phase separation at a single node exists in numerous fluid systems and has been widely studied in different contexts . in microvascular blood flow ,",
    "krogh introduced the term `` plasma skimming '' in order to explain the disproportionate distribution of red blood cells observed at single branch bifurcations _ in vivo _",
    "numerous authors have demonstrated plasma skimming _ in vitro _ and _ in vivo _ and developed simple empirical models to describe the effect  @xcite .",
    "another widely studied example of phase distribution at a single node is gas - liquid two - phase flow which has important technological applications in power and process industries . in",
    "many process applications phase maldistribution can have detrimental consequences for downstream equipment  @xcite , while in some cases the phenomenon is exploited to build simple phase separators  @xcite .",

    "the impact of phase maldistribution in two - phase flow has been shown to impact network flows in refrigeration systems  @xcite and solar power systems  @xcite .    while the behavior at a single node has been well - studied experimentally in the applications noted above , systematic analysis of networks with two - phase flow",
    "have received less attention .",
    "the most widely studied network is the microvascular one for which the first modeling effort for dynamics was conducted by kiani _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in 1994",
    "they conducted a direct simulation of 400 vessels and found oscillations in the flow . in 2000 carr and lecoin found oscillations in networks with fifteen vessels  @xcite .",
    "they found evidence of hopf bifurcations and limit cycles , but were unable to determine which parameters controlled the dynamics . in an attempt to understand the parameters that lead to spontaneous oscillations in microvascular flows , geddes _",
    "performed a complete analysis of the flow - driven 2-node network ( one inlet , a loop , and one outlet ) in 2007  @xcite .",
    "while this network can exhibit oscillations in theory , they do not exist for realistic physical parameters .",
    "several other groups have since studied the problem of oscillations in microvascular networks , and a coherent picture is beginning to emerge  @xcite .    in the context of microvascular flow",
    "we now know that networks with 2 vessels can exhibit spontaneous oscillations for unrealistic physical parameters while networks with 15 vessels can oscillate for realistic parameters  @xcite .",
    "it is unknown at what level of network complexity oscillations can emerge and what parameters govern their existence .",
    "while the 2-node network has been fully characterized theoretically , full descriptions of more complicated networks becomes difficult . while we have studied the equilibrium properties of the 3-node network ( two inlets , a loop , and one outlet ) theoretically and experimentally in prior work  @xcite , we had no systematic method to understand the stability other than through direct simulation . while we did not predict the existence of oscillations for the parameters relevant to our experiments , with no systematic method to analyze the stability and the large number of parameters it is impossible to rule out the emergence of spontaneous oscillations .    in this paper",
    "we develop a methodology for finding and tracking hopf bifurcations through continuation .",
    "this development is critical due to the large parameter space of the problem .",
    "we find that our analytical methods are in perfect agreement with direct numerical simulations , validating the methodology .",
    "using our methods we develop phase diagrams that show a rich set of dynamics including multiple frequency oscillations and co - existing limit cycles .",
    "the details of these predictions depend sensitively on the constitutive laws for the fluids in the network and the phase separation at a single diverging node .",
    "however , our methodology is general and may be applied to any two - phase flow network system .",
    "the physical setup is shown in figure [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "the network has two flow controlled inlets , each of which contains a fluid comprised of two separate phases , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the two phases are two fluids which have different viscosities and remain distinct at least up to the inlet of the network . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is the more viscous fluid .",
    "locally at a point along the tube we define the local volume fraction as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the volumetric flow rate of each phase . in an experiment the volume fraction in the two inlets would be set upstream by flow controlled pumps attached to reservoirs of fluids @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the case of",
    "blood flow the @xmath0 phase is plasma , the @xmath1 phase is red blood cells and the volume fraction is the hematocrit . while blood is not really comprised of two continuous fluid phases , such a model is commonly used in numerical simulations or laboratory experiments @xcite .     and @xmath4 at controlled flow rates @xmath5 and @xmath6 . while the flow in vessels @xmath7 and @xmath8 is always from left to right in this figure , the flow in vessel @xmath9 can be up or down depending on the state of the network , with @xmath10 representing downward flow and @xmath11 representing upward flow .",
    ", width=207 ]    the basic network model based on fundamental conservation principles will be developed in the next section .",
    "however , to close the model we require two constitutive laws which depend on the details of the fluid system and the network geometry ; i ) the effective viscosity as a function of volume fraction and ii ) the phase separation rule for a single node .",
    "the details encoded in these two constitutive laws play a dramatic role in the eventual behavior of the network  @xcite .",
    "we assume laminar flow in cylindrical tubes where the hydraulic resistance is proportional to the viscosity of the fluid mixture . since we have have a two - phase flow we can compute an effective viscosity , @xmath12 , which is a function of not only the two fluids involved but their geometrical arrangement in the tube . the effective viscosity can be expressed in terms of the viscosity of the less - viscous phase , @xmath13 , and a relative viscosity ; @xmath14 .",
    "simple newtonian fluids approximately follow a nonlinear arrhenhius law when they are well mixed , @xmath15 here @xmath13 and @xmath16 are the viscosities of the individual phases , and @xmath17 is the viscosity contrast .",
    "different viscosity laws exist for different physical manifestations rather than complete mixing . for newtonian fluids that remain stratified in a circular tube as separate phases , the relative viscosity follows a relationship which can be readily computed though no simple analytical form exists  @xcite .",
    "another common physical configuration is a core annular flow where the viscous fluid assumes a cylindrical core which is lubricated by an annulus of less viscous fluid in a cylindrical tube   @xcite . for the example of microvascular blood flow",
    "the rheology is more complicated , however pries _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite compiled a database of viscosity measurements in tubes with a range of diameters and hematocrits . while the exact form of the above viscosity laws all differ , the important fact is that they are all nonlinear functions of the volume fraction which is a key feature for networks to exhibit multiple equilibrium states and spontaneous oscillations  @xcite . throughout this work",
    "we will assume for convenience that the effective viscosity is determined by equation [ eq : viscosity ] .",
    "the phase separation rule for each node is a complex function which depends sensitively on the fluid system , the node geometry , and the inlet flow rate .",
    "the phase separation rule relates the downstream volume fractions in two daughter branches to the inlet flow state . for this work",
    "we explore the consequences of two different separation functions which are valid for 1 ) microvascular blood flow and 2 ) stratified laminar flow of two newtonian fluids . for microvascular blood flow",
    ", numerous authors have demonstrated this separation of red blood cells from plasma ( _ i.e. _ , plasma skimming ) and developed simple empirical models to describe the effect @xcite .",
    "these empirical relations become part of the network model . in our previous work on networks with stratified laminar flow where the fluids remain as distinct phases , we measured the separation function for this system , demonstrated that we could compute the functions via 3d navier - stokes simulations , and developed an approximate one - parameter model for use in network modeling  @xcite . in that work gravity was normal to the plane of the network flow .",
    "it has been shown that , unlike the effective viscosity model , the exact form of the separation function has a dramatic effect on the types of equilibrium and dynamic behavior that may be observed  @xcite .",

    "it is recognized that such simple functions are limited in their accuracy , but they are useful in allowing for easy incorporation into analysis and providing some insight into expected experimental behavior . for example , a common fit function for microvascular flows is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the normalized flow in branch @xmath9 shown in the schematic of figure [ fig : visc_plasma ] .",

    "i.e. _ , it does not matter how we arrange the downstream vessels .",
    "the same is not true for the phase separation function of stratified flow ; different arrangements of the downstream vessels results in different phase separation . in both cases",
