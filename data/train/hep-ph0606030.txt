    "<S> it is widely accepted that sufficiently cold and dense quark matter is a color superconductor @xcite . the most likely and , probably , the only place where color superconductivity can exist in the universe is the interior of compact stars . </S>",
    "<S> thus , studies of phases of quark matter under conditions realized in the bulk of compact stars ( i.e. , color and electric charge neutrality , and @xmath2-equilibrium ) have recently attracted a great deal of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the density regime of relevance for compact stars is up to a few times the normal nuclear density @xmath3 . in this `` moderate '' density regime , </S>",
    "<S> the studies of qcd - motivated effective theories are most useful and have revealed a rich phase structure @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most striking features of neutral and @xmath2-equilibrated color - superconducting phases is unconventional cross - flavor cooper pairing of quarks with the possibility of gapless superconductivity , e.g. , in the form of the gapless 2sc ( g2sc ) phase @xcite or the gapless color - flavor - locked ( gcfl ) phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was , however , quickly realized that the 2sc / g2sc phases suffer from a chromomagnetic instability , indicated by imaginary meissner screening masses of some gluons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in the 2sc phase , these instabilities occur when the ratio of the gap over the mismatch of the chemical potential , @xmath4 , decreases below a value @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> similar instabilities were found also in the gcfl phase @xcite .    resolving the chromomagnetic instability and clarifying the nature of the true ground state of dense quark matter are the most pressing tasks in the study of color superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> it was proposed that the chromomagnetic instability in two - flavor quark matter can be removed by the formation of a single plane - wave loff state @xcite ( first studied by larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite , and fulde and ferrell @xcite in the context of solid state physics , and by alford , bowers , and rajagopal @xcite for cold , dense quark matter ) , or a gluonic phase with vector condensation in the ground state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( for a recent discussion of this issue , see also refs .  </S>",

    "<S> alternatives include a mixed phase @xcite and , in the case of three - flavor quark matter , also phases with spontaneously induced meson supercurrents @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the neutral loff state is free from the chromomagnetic instability in the weak - coupling regime @xcite , this is , in fact , not the case for somewhat larger values of the coupling @xcite . at the same time , the gluonic phase can resolve the instability there . </S>",
    "<S> so far , however , the gluonic phase phase has been studied only around the critical point @xmath6 @xcite .    the gluonic phase and </S>",
    "<S> the loff phases are currently viewed as the most likely candidates for resolving the chromomagnetic instability and , thus , for the true ground state of two - flavor color - superconducting quark matter . </S>",
    "<S> ( here we exclude the possibility of phase separation @xcite which may have limitations of its own and deserves a separate in - depth study . ) in order to see which of the two proposed phases is actually preferred , one first has to extend the analysis of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to a computation of the free energy away from the critical point @xmath6 , and then compare the results to the free energy of the single - plane loff state . </S>",

    "<S> we qualitatively confirm the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and extend them by ( approximately ) including the neutrality condition and explicitly comparing the free energy of the gluonic phase to that of the single plane - wave loff phase as a function of the coupling strength .    in order to study various phases of two - flavor quark matter , we use a gauged nambu  </S>",
    "<S> jona - lasinio ( njl ) model with massless up and down quarks : @xmath7 where the quark field @xmath8 carries flavor ( @xmath9 with @xmath10 ) and color ( @xmath11 with @xmath12 ) indices , @xmath13 is the charge conjugation matrix ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the antisymmetric tensors in flavor and color spaces , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the covariant derivative and the field strength tensor are defined as    @xmath16    to evaluate loop diagrams we use a three - momentum cutoff @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the model has two phenomenological model parameters , the cutoff @xmath17 and the diquark coupling @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath19  mev throughout this paper , but we consider @xmath18 as a free parameter . henceforth , in order to specify the diquark coupling we use @xmath20 which is the value of the 2sc gap at @xmath21 ( see below ) .    in @xmath2-equilibrated neutral 2sc / g2sc matter </S>",
    "<S> , the elements of the diagonal matrix of quark chemical potentials @xmath22 are given by    @xmath23    with @xmath24 in a gauge theory , the self - consistent solution of the yang - mills equations requires background gauge fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these can be viewed as electric- and color - chemical potentials which ensure electric and color - charge neutrality of the system . </S>",
    "<S> note that a generalization of this holds true even in the case of inhomogeneous phases . </S>",
    "<S> then , of course , the corresponding fields would not be constant in space . </S>",
    "<S> instead , they would have a constant central value contribution and , on top of it , a coordinate - dependent modulation describing color - electric fields induced by the inhomogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> the constant contribution would take care of the _ global _ neutrality , while the modulation describes the local field needed to prevent the _ local _ flow of currents .    on the other hand , in njl - type models without dynamic gauge fields , one has to ensure electric and color - charge neutrality by introducing appropriate chemical potentials by hand @xcite . in the case of the 2sc / g2sc phases , </S>",
    "<S> we only require an electron chemical potential @xmath25 , and a color - chemical potential @xmath26 which ensures that the color - charge density @xmath27 is zero . in principle , </S>",
    "<S> in other phases like the gluonic phase one has to check that no other color - charge density is non - vanishing and necessitates the introduction of a respective color - chemical potential . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite requires a non - vanishing temporal component of the gluon field of the third color , @xmath28 . in our gauged njl model , </S>",

    "<S> , we choose the diquark condensate to point in the third ( blue ) direction in color space .    in the one - loop approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the free energy of two - flavor quark matter at @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where `` det '' stands for the determinant in dirac , flavor , color , and nambu - gorkov space . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the free energy in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , eq .  ( [ eqn : omega1 ] ) does not have a quartic term in @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because we neglected the color - chemical potential @xmath26 and , in addition , we take into account only one dynamic gluonic field ( see below ) .    in the gluonic phase @xcite , the chromomagnetic instability at @xmath38 triggers a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value of the spatial component of @xmath39 ( for a simpler version of such a phenomenon , see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . ) using the @xmath40 rotational symmetry and the @xmath41 color symmetry , one can choose @xmath42 without loss of generality . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the non - zero vacuum expectation value of @xmath43 breaks @xmath40 , leaving only @xmath44 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a non - vanishing @xmath43 together with @xmath45 and @xmath25 breaks the original symmetry of qcd down to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a subgroup of the @xmath48 chiral symmetry and the charge @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the flavor matrix of the electric charges of quarks .    </S>",
    "<S> the reduced symmetry of the ground state with @xmath52 allows for additional condensates , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , such condensates are required by the equation of motion . </S>",

    "<S> the field @xmath13 , on the other hand , induces electric superconductivity in the ground state and , therefore , is physically more interesting . </S>",
    "<S> however , including all three gluonic fields makes the analysis quite involved . in this work , we retain only the @xmath43 field that is directly connected to the meissner masses of gluons 47 and , thus , is the most relevant field for the chromomagnetic instability .    </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrated that the energetically favored state of a neutral two - flavor color superconductor is not the 2sc / g2sc phase in the intermediate- and strong - coupling regimes but the gluonic phase in which the dynamic gluonic field @xmath98 acquires a vacuum expectation value . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the whole g2sc phase is replaced by the gluonic phase which is chromomagnetically stable .    </S>",
    "<S> we also compared the free energies of the 2sc / g2sc phase , the neutral loff state , and the gluonic phase . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the gluonic phase is energetically favored in the intermediate- and strong - coupling regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the encouraging results of this analysis should be further improved in the future by ( i ) taking into account the most general ansatz for the gauge - field configuration in the gluonic phase , ( ii ) by calculating the free energy in a self - consistent manner . </S>",
    "<S> we already performed a preliminary investigation including the effect of the gluon field @xmath55 , responsible for enforcing gauss law , and found that , for @xmath99 mev , the additional cost in the free energy is of order @xmath100 , and thus negligible . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath101 mev , however , the effect of the @xmath55 field could be an order of magnitude larger .    </S>",
    "<S> it is appropriate to mention that the instability related to the 8th gluon was not studied in the present work . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the neutral loff state is appealing , because the meissner mass of the 8th gluon is automatically zero in this state . </S>",
    "<S> it should also be mentioned that in the strongly coupled loff state @xcite the longitudinal meissner mass squared of the 8th gluon is negative . </S>",
    "<S> although this instability was not addressed in this work , it is unlikely , however , that the loff state is energetically favored in the strong - coupling regime . </S>"
