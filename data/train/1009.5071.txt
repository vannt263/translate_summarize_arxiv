    "0.3 cm recently , nicoli commented that the einstein equation is inconsistent from the outset @xcite because the left - hand side ( lhs ) and the right - hand side ( rhs ) of the equation @xmath2 are logically different .",
    "the lhs is exactly determined by the continuous space - time geometry .",
    "it is a classical concept on the geometry . on the other hand ,",
    "the rhs is contributed by quanta of particles which have roots in the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics in addition to the continuous vacuum energy if present .",
    "any discussion in the planck era is speculative and not yet well formulated as kolb and turner stress in the last chapter of @xcite . to answer this question satisfactorily",
    ", we must have a good quantum theory of gravity .",
    "so , i must admit that any solution of the cosmological constant ( cc ) problem may be incomplete at present , and what i present here is the cc solution idea just by replacing @xmath3 on the rhs of ( [ eq : einstein ] ) by a classically interpretable @xmath4 . at present",
    ", we do not know whether we are in a situation similar to classical electrodynamics in the early 20th century where the stability of an electron in hydrogen needed a continuous distribution of positive charges , which was the thompson model of hydrogen . with quantum mechanics",
    ", we became to understand hydrogen in terms of the rutherford model .",
    "so , the cc problem may have a root in a completely different domain of physics on which we may be unfamiliar now . in this sense",
    ", we may look for any reasonable solution of the problem and it is welcome if it is not contradicted outrageously from the present perspective on the fundamental physics . in this spirit",
    "i present an idea with a specific action toward a cc solution .",
    "but there exists one nagging question on the proposal : why such an action",
    "? it may be like the stability problem of the rutherford model with the 19th century eye of classical electrodynamics .",
    "the cc was introduced almost ninety - three years ago by einstein @xcite .",
    "then , much later when the spontaneous symmetry breaking is widely discussed in the standard model , veltman commented that the vacuum energy arising in spontaneous symmetry breaking adds to the cc @xcite , basically raising a question on the naturalness of setting it to zero .",
    "even before considering the tree level cc , the loop correction to the vacuum energy was a problem since the early days of quantum mechanics .",
    "any mode contributes @xmath5 to the vacuum energy . in the cc discussion here",
    ", we will not rely on the probably - already - happened anthropic arguments @xcite .",
    "so , we consider the cc generically , at the tree and also at loop levels unless the figures of fig .",
    "[ fig : loops ] are forbidden .",
    "for example , the lhs figure of fig .",
    "[ fig : loops ] corresponds to @xmath5 per mode and the rhs figure is the two - loop vacuum energy arising from the @xmath6-terms in supergravity @xcite .",
    "there can be many more diagrams contributing to the vacuum energy at the loop levels .",
    "loop corrections to the cc.,width=377 ]    if a symmetry is present in changing the cc @xmath7 , one may try a scalar potential of fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] where the vertical axis corresponds to the cc .",
    "the vanishing cc is the point which the arrow points to and the vacuum is the point where the bullet is located . as fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] shows , in general the vanishing cc point does not corresponds to the bullet where the equation of motion is satisfied .",
    "so , a solution is not easily realizable in four space - time dimensions ( 4d ) .",
    "in addition , the cc problem must also take into account the result of spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the vacuum energy scale at the interesting particle physics scales are generally much greater than the current limit of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the cc is a serious fine - tuning problem . in 4d",
    ", we do not find any symmetry such that the cc is forbidden .",
    "note , however , the recent tries of scale invariance and brane statistical search @xcite .     a form of the potential energy with multiple solutions . ]     a form of the potential energy with multiple solutions . ]",
    "another question is at which energy scale and _ temperature _ , the cc is required to vanish .",
    "there exists a hierarchy of mass scales in particle physics :    * planck   scale :   @xmath9 gev * gut   scale :   @xmath10 gev * inflation  scale :  @xmath11 gev , down   to   the  ew  scale * axion   scale : @xmath12 gev * hidden  sector   scale :   @xmath13 gev @xcite , down   to   @xmath14 gev @xcite * ew   scale :   100 gev * qcd   scale :   1 gev * nuclear   physics   scale :   10 mev * electron   mass   scale :   0.5 mev * neutrino   mass   scale :   @xmath15 * accelerating   universe   scale :   @xmath16 * temperature   of   the   cmb :   @xmath17    for example , even though we suppose to have a cc solution at an ew scale , still @xmath18 fine - tuning is required .",
    "it is a hierarchy among the parameters in the lagrangian .",
    "since the cc is dimension 4 parameter , it has the most severe fine - tuning problem in the lagrangian .",
    "thus , finding a solution of the cc problem is very difficult and is hence challenging .",
    "therefore , any simple idea toward a solution is welcome at this stage if it is not obviously wrong .",
    "0.3 cm when we consider quantum mechanics , we talk in terms of the probability amplitude : the initial state @xmath19 transforming to a final state @xmath20 . in this spirit , baum @xcite and hawking @xcite",
    "considered the euclidian action , only with the ricci scalar @xmath21 and the cc .",
    "the method touches upon the quantum gravity , by calculating the path integral in the euclidian spacetime .",
    "the path integral deals with all possible paths and in the @xmath22 limit it is dominated by the classical equations of motion . if the topology change of the metric is considered , we must know the full gravity equation such as those including wormhole solutions @xcite , in which case an exponential of exponential function was obtained @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we do not delve into an exponential of an exponential . without the topology change which may be a reasonable assumption much below the planck scale ,",

    "the euclidian action integral which we consider first from @xcite has the following form @xmath23 so , @xmath24 dominates the action integral , which is interpreted as the probability for @xmath24 is close to 1 .",
    "but , there are questions regarding to this baum - hawking solution . hawking @xcite states",
    ", @xmath25my proposal requires that a variable effective cc be genarated in some manner .",
    "one possibility would be to include the values of the cc in the variables that are integrated over in the path integral . \" for this purpose , ref .",
    "@xcite explicitly considered in terms of @xmath26 ( or the field strength @xmath27 ) which however is not a dynamical field in 4d .    in this scenario ,",
    "the needed quantity to calculate is the action integral .",
    "even if we understand the cc in this way , there exists another questions such as    * how do we assign the initial state ? * how does the needed primary inflation come about in this scenario ? * how does it fit to the current dark energy ?",
    "so the cc solution needs to answer the other two cc related questions also and furthermore needs an argument on ,  what was the proper initial condition of our universe ? \"    the existing idea of hawking in terms of @xmath27 with no kinetic energy term can not explain all the above questions .",
    "we must introduce the kinetic term with the potential shape given as that of fig .",
    "[ fig : varpoten ] so that the point where the equation of motion is satisfied can be the point with @xmath28 .",
    "for example , @xmath27 can achieve this but without the kinetic energy term in 4d .",
    "if we want to use @xmath27 field , we must work beyond 4d .",

    "however , the specific form of the above bulk action is arguable for a general cc solution . even though we allow this procedure , still it has its own problem that a singularity is present at a point @xmath31 in the bulk .",
    "the singularity can be cured by inserting the @xmath32 symmetric branes at @xmath33 @xcite , @xmath34_{x^5=+y_s } + \\int d^4x\\sqrt{-g_4}\\left[-v_-e^{b_-\\phi } \\right]_{x^5=-y_s}. \\label{eq : forste}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , to cancel the contribution of the sm brane of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ark ] ) , one must fine - tune the cc contribution from the singularities of eq .",
    "( [ eq : forste ] ) @xcite .",
    "again a fine - tuning is needed : @xmath35 , leading to a fine tuning between @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , there exists the no - go theorem under some plausible conditions such that one employs the usual kinetic energy term and assumes the lorentz symmetry and the existence of 4d gravity for a large distance separation @xcite .    here , we try to go beyond the above set - up .",
    "namely , we do not specify the bulk action in terms of specific constants .",
    "instead , we allow non - standard kinetic energy term to avoid the no - go theorem . in our discussion we will distinguish @xmath7 s , depending where it originates , the barred ones and the rest : @xmath38 in this spirit , there exists one self - tuning model by kim , kyae and lee ( kkl ) @xcite .",

    "0.5 cm this idea of quantum cosmology must be recast with extra dimensions and branes .",
    "the kkl solution has a remarkable property as noted in @xcite that the vanishing cc solution is not allowed for the parameter range of @xmath57 since the boundary condition at the brane @xmath58 can not be satisfied .",
    "this situation is depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig : inflstage ] all the possibilities are open , the flat , ds and ads solutions .",
    "then the inflationary period might end , but the important question is what is the probability to choose the flat solution .",
    "here comes the probability calculation . in the kkl model",
    ", we show that the probability shape is given as the rhs of fig .",
    "[ fig : inflquint ] .",
    "the number of e - foldings during inflation is about 60 , or the scale factor increases by a factor @xmath60 .",
    "so , the brane lagrangian for inflation is tuned to satisfy this condition .",
    "then , the initial temperature @xmath61 drops to @xmath62 before the inflaton reheats up the universe . at this supercooled state before reheating , we define the initial state of the universe for the probability calculation .",
    "we require that this initial state is fuzzy enough to allow 0.002 ev vacuum energy , even if the probability calculation of fig .",
    "[ fig : ccprob ] dictates the vacuum energy should be zero .",

    "for example , the height of the quintessential axion of ref .",
    "@xcite can be of order @xmath65 but the fuzziness of our cc solution is of order @xmath66 , which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : inflquint ] .",
    "so , with any inflation model where the beginning of inflation starts below @xmath64 gev , the fuzziness too small and we can not satisfy the observed acceleration @xcite within our scheme of the cc solution .     the initial inflation and the recent acceleration . the cc solution is swamped in the lavender band and the wave function of the universe is not exactly choosing the equilibrium point . ]",
    "we take our initial condition at the time immediately after the inflation .",
    "we picked up the matter energy being in a certain region after the inflation .",
    "so , our boundary condition is a matter energy eigenstate , amounting to a kind of quantum mechanical filtering process .",
    "0.3 cm hawking calculated the probability amplitude from @xmath67e^{-i_e[g]}\\label{eq : probamp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and concluded that the volume integral is the dominant factor and concluded that the probability is the largest for @xmath68 @xcite . in hawking s case , it is not clear how the primordial inflation is taken into account . in our case ,",
    "the primordial inflation is achieved in the brane dynamics as explained in the previous section .",
    "next , the initial state is given when @xmath59 rolls into the flat space region of fig .",
    "[ fig : inflstage ] .",
    "this initial state that @xmath59 sits in the flat space region is the quantum mechanical filtering process .",
    "so , to measure some state out of the state @xmath19 , we calculate the amplitude ( [ eq : probamp ] ) .    if particle physics lagrangian does not contribute to ( [ eq : probamp ] ) , it is sufficient to consider the cc term and the @xmath21 term only as hawking has done . hawking s basic argument was the size of the euclidian volume .",
    "the ds space volume is finite , the flat space volume is infinite , and the ads space volume is even more infinite . if we consider only the @xmath69 term , the ads wins in magnitude but the sign is opposite from the ds ; thus the flat space is chosen .",
    "so , even if the ads is considered , the flat space wins if we restricts only to @xmath69 term .",
    "however , as in the self - tuning model of kkl , particle physics lagrangian contributes to the final cc in general , and the particle physics action has the @xmath70 behavior which dominates the cc term contribution in the small @xmath71 region .",
    "this may change hawking s view completely .",
    "if we consider the sizes of volumes , the ads wins over the flat even though both are infinite . for the flat volume ,",
    "we take the @xmath0 limit of the ds case . for the ads volume",
    ", we need to regularize the infinity to compare different cases of @xmath71 s .",
    "here , i discuss what has been discussed on the @xmath1 lagrangian in the hawking type calculation , present a ( probably ) correct way to calculate the amplitude , and show that the kkl self - tuning model allows a finite range of parameters for which @xmath72 has the singularly large probability @xcite .",
    "0.3 cm 0.5 cm hawking presented the first calculation , using @xmath1 term in the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "since then , there has been discussions on which value of the @xmath1 term must be used in the action integral . in this regard , a surface term @xmath73 has been noted , which does not change the equation of motion .",
    "it turned out that it amounts to changing the sign of @xmath1 term in the action integral @xcite , from which duff concluded that the probability amplitude for @xmath0 is least probable with @xmath27 .",
    "recently , wu @xcite obtained the opposite result from that of duff . in our case also , we can consider a surface term ( due to @xmath74-independent @xmath75 ) , following the first order formalism of @xcite , @xmath76 which does not affect the equation of motion .",
    "if we follow duff s method , it has the effect of changing the sign of @xmath77 term inside the action integral with the surface term neglected , from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "so , both methods satisfy the equations of motion with the action integral , @xmath80\\\\ & \\uparrow\\nonumber\\\\ & { \\rm wu}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , it raises an important question , @xmath25which method is correct ? \"      0.3 cm 0.5 cm to our view , the confusion arises from taking a specific vacuum in their calculation @xcite . as in the @xmath82-vacuum of qcd , we have the @xmath81-vacuum of antisymmetric tensor field @xmath27 .",
    "duff took one extremum point corresponding to @xmath83 and wu took another vacuum corresponding to @xmath84 , and they obtained different results even though both satisfied equations of motion .",
    "as far as the @xmath81-vacuum is concerned , the discussion is parallel whether we use @xmath1 or @xmath77 in the lagrangian .",
