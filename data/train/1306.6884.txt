    "chemical concepts as fundamental as atomic orbitals ( aos ) in molecules , covalent bonds , or even partial charges , do not correspond to physical observables and thus can not be unambigously defined in pure quantum theory .",
    "this leads to the unpleasing situation that quantum chemistry can tell us benzene s heat of formation with < 2 kj / mol accuracy,@xcite but , strictly speaking , neither that it has twelve localized @xmath0-bonds and a delocalized @xmath1-system , nor what the partial charges on the carbons are .",
    "chemical bonds have even been compared to unicorns  mythical creatures of which everyone knows how they look , despite nobody ever having seen one.@xcite    however , qualitative concepts are of essential importance for practical chemistry , and thus a large number of competing techniques were developed for extracting them from quantum chemical calculations .",
    "in particular , bader s atoms in molecules@xcite and weinholds natural atomic / bond orbital analysis ( nao / nbo)@xcite are widely used for interpreting molecular electronic structure .",
    "nonetheless , the former is known to produce counter - intuitive results in many cases,@xcite and the latter , while undoubtedly having brought countless successes in chemical interpretation , is complicated and pre - imposes various non - trivial assumptions .",
    "in particular , nbo analysis is based on the two notions that atomic orbitals ( aos ) in molecules have spherical symmetry and can be obtained by a particular complex series of transformations,@xcite and that a lewis - like bonding pattern for any given molecule _ exists _ and only needs to be found  by comparing the wave function to all possible lewis patterns.@xcite while normally applicable , violations of both assumptions are conceivable in unusual bonding situations , and might then lead to erratic interpretations .",
    "we here present a new technique to connect quantitative self - consistent field ( scf ) wave functions to a qualitative chemical picture .",
    "this technique is essentially free of empirical input , allows for _ computing _ the nature and shape of chemical bonds , and is not biased towards any preconceived notion of bonding .",
    "this is achieved by first defining a new intrinsic minimal basis ( imb ) , a set of perturbed core- and valence aos which can exactly describe the occupied molecular orbitals ( mos ) of a previously computed scf wave function .",
    "we will show that the intrinsic aos ( iaos ) thus defined can be directly interpreted as the _ chemical _ aos , and that partial charges and bond orbitals ( ibos ) derived from them perfectly agree with both experimental data and intuitive chemical concepts .",
    "in particular , we find a natural _ emergence _ of the lewis structure of molecules .",
    "while other imb constructions have been developed before , @xcite most are rather complex and so far none has found widespread use comparable to bader or nao analysis . our contribution is a imb which is simple and efficient , its use in constructing bond orbitals , and the demonstration that this combination shows excellent promise for interpreting chemical bonding and reactivity .",
    "the technique thereby provides a firm quantum mechanical basis for ubiquitous fundamental concepts .",
    "assume that we have computed a molecular scf wave function @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath2 is defined by its occupied mos @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are basis functions from a large basis set @xmath5 .",
    "the key problem in interpreting wave functions is that the basis functions @xmath6 can not be clearly associated with any atom ; each function will contribute most where it is most needed , and due to @xmath5 s high variational freedom , this often is not on the atom it is placed on . on the other hand , if one were to expand the mos over a minimal basis @xmath7 of free - atom aos ( i.e. , a basis of accurate aos , but e.g. , with only aos 1s,2s,2px-2pz for each c atom ) , the wave function would be easy to interpret .",
    "but it would be inaccurate , and might be even qualitatively incorrect , because free - atom aos contain no polarization due to the molecular environment .",
    "we thus propose to first calculate an accurate wave function @xmath2 , and then to form a set of polarized aos @xmath8 which can exactly express @xmath2s occupied mos @xmath9 .",
    "for this , we first split the free - atom aos @xmath10 into contributions corresponding to a depolarized occupied space @xmath11 and its complement @xmath12 .",
    "the depolarized mos are obtained as @xmath13 by projecting the accurate mos @xmath9 from the main basis @xmath5 onto the minimal basis @xmath7 ( which can not express polarization ) and back .",
    "maps any point @xmath14 to its closest point @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 ] we can then get the polarized aos @xmath17 from the free - atom aos @xmath18 by simply projecting their contributions in @xmath19 and @xmath12 onto their polarized counterparts @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath22    thus , to construct the polarized aos it is sufficient to load a free - atom basis , calculate its overlap with the main basis and within itself , and perform the numerically trivial projection .",
    "contrary to the related approach of ref .",
    ", no functional optimization or reference to virtual orbitals is required . in this article",
    "we will also symmetrically orthogonalize the vectors obtained by , to arrive at an orthonormal minimal basis which divides the one - particle space into atomic contributions ; the latter will be referred to as intrinsic atomic orbitals ( iaos ) .",
    "while the construction makes reference to free - atom aos through basis @xmath7 , it must be stressed that these are _ not _ empirical quantities .",
    "free - atom orbitals can be _ calculated _ with any high - level quantum chemistry program . however , in practice this is not even required because they are already tabulated as part of several standard basis sets ; here we take the ao functions of cc - pvtz.@xcite    since iaos are directly associated with atoms , they can be used to define atomic properties like partial charges .",
    "let us denote the closed - shell scf density matrix as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are the occupied mos .",
    "we can then define @xmath25 as the partial charge on atom @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the atom s nuclear charge and @xmath28 its iaos .",
    "tab.[tab : basissetdependence ] shows that the partial charges obtained are insensitive to the basis set , follow trends in electronegativities , and some defects seen in other methods ( e.g. , bader s description of the cn bond in hcn as ionic ) are absent .",
    "partial charges will be further analyzed below .",

    "we now show that by combining the iaos with orbital localization in the spirit of pipek - mezey ( pm),@xcite one can explicitly construct bond orbitals ( ibos ) , without any empirical input , and _ entirely within the framework of mo theory_. a slater determinant @xmath2 is invariant to unitary rotations @xmath31 amongst its occupied mos @xmath9 .",

    "fig.[fig : acrylicacidilo ] shows ibos computed for the acrylic acid molecule . here",
    "16 of 19 occupied mos can be expressed to > @xmath37 by charge with iaos on one or two centers , respectively .",
    "the three other mos are part of a @xmath1-system : the oxygen @xmath36 lone pairs ( which have about 7% bonding character ) , and the c@xmath38c @xmath1-bond ( which has about 3% contributions on the third c atom , and about 1% on the doubly - bonded o ) . in total",
    ", we see a direct correspondence of the obtained ibos with the classical bonding picture : @xmath0-bonds , @xmath1-bonds , and lone pairs are exactly where expected , and the @xmath1-system is slightly delocalized .",
    "we stress again that these 19 ibos are _ exactly equivalent _ to the occupied mos they are generated from : their anti - symmetrized product is the scf wave function , and this is a valid representation of its electronic structure .",
    "note that the ibo construction makes no reference to the molecule s lewis structure whatsoever ; the classical bonding picture thus arises as an emergent phenomenon rooted in the molecular electronic structure itself , even if not imposed .",
    "the major improvement of ibos over pm orbitals is that they are based on iao charges instead of the erratic mulliken charges ( cf .",
    "ch@xmath39 in tab.[tab : basissetdependence ] ) . as a result ,",
    "ibos are always well - defined , while pm orbitals are unsuitable for interpretation because they are unphysically tied to the basis set ( they do not even _ have _ a basis set limit ) .",
    "ibos lift this weakness while retaining and even improving on pm s computational attractiveness.@xcite",
    "our hypothesis is that iaos offer a chemically sound definition of atoms in a molecule .",
    "but since these are not physically observable , this claim can only be backed by consistency with empirical laws and facts.@xcite we thus now investigate whether partial charges derived from iaos follow expected trends based on electronegativies , c 1s core level shifts , and linear free - energy relationships for resonance substituent effects ( taft s @xmath40 ) .",
    "we then go on to see how ibos reflect bonding in some non - trivial molecules .",
    "we saw in tab.[tab : basissetdependence ] that , unlike mulliken charges , iao charges are insensitive to the employed basis set , and unlike bader charges , iao do not erronously describe the cn bond in hcn as ionic .",
    "we now follow ref .   and investigate iao charges in relation to electronegativity @xmath41 diffences .",
    "we start with the series ch@xmath42x ( x = f , cl , br , h ) . due to the ( allen@xcite ) electronegativities (",
    "f : 4.193 , cl : 2.869 ,",
    "br : 2.685 , c : 2.544 , h : 2.300 ) , we expect halogens to have a negative charge , getting smaller in the series , and hydrogen to have a positive charge . as shown in fig.[fig : halogenmethanes]*a * , this is what we find . in fig.[fig : halogenmethanes]*b * , we show the series yh@xmath39 ( y = c , si , ge ) .",
    "we find charges in close correspondence with @xmath41 ( c : 2.544 , si : 1.916 , ge : 1.994 ) , and the inversion that @xmath43 is properly reflected . if we extrapolate the curves in * a * and * b * to @xmath44 , we find in both cases that @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "that is , if there is no difference in electronegativity , iao partial charges predict no bond polarization . this consistency with empirical electronegativies",
    "is further reflected in the almost linear shapes of the curves . in the series ch@xmath47f@xmath48 ( n=0@xmath494 )",

    "this is the same level of correlation as obtained with dipole moment derivatives,@xcite and much higher than for chelps , bader , or mulliken charges.@xcite    one advantage of hilbert - space based partial charges over real - space partial charges is that they can be split not only into atomic contributions , but also orbital contributions .",
    "recently ozimiski and dobrowolski@xcite used this freedom to introduce a set of descriptors for the electronic @xmath0- and @xmath1-substituent effects , called seda and peda , and showed that they are both internally consistent and highly correlated with empirical substituent effect parameters like taft s @xmath40 .",
    "concretely , for a substituted benzene r - c@xmath65h@xmath66 , the peda parameter is defined as the number of @xmath67 electrons on the six carbon atoms of the benzene ring , relative to the unsubstituted benzene : @xmath68 where ozimiski defined this quantity based on nao population analysis@xcite with a specified type of wave function and basis set . in order to demonstrate the potential of iao charges in the interpretation of chemical reactivity , in fig.[fig : pedavssigmar ]",
    "we show that the same kind of correlation with empirical substituent constants is also obtained when calculating peda from iao charges ( @xmath69 ) instead of nao charges ( @xmath70@xcite ) .",
    "substituent constants taken from ref . .",
    "]    calculating such eda values is computationally trivial , which makes them an attractive quantity in the study of unusual substituents not be contained in common tables , or for testing if the substituents behave differently for different hosts than benzene",
    ". indeed , a similar idea to ozimiski s has been considered previously,@xcite but was much less practical due to being based on carefully crafted real - space integration because hilbert space approaches were considered unreliable.@xcite    a deeper insight into the nature of a molecule s bonding can be obtained by calculating its bond orbitals .",
    "as previously noted , ibos are an _",
    "exact _ representation of scf wave functions , and we have seen in fig.[fig : acrylicacidilo ] that they normally reflect the classical bonding concepts one to one .",
    "however , in many molecules the lewis structure does not tell the entire story .",
    "therefore we now probe how ibos reflect bonding in some well known , but in different senses non - trivial molecules .",
    "-bonds , and * b * six ch @xmath0-bonds , both localized , and * c - e * one of the two equivalent ibo sets representing the delocalized @xmath1-system of three orbitals . * f - h * : see text ]    -bond of cyclopropane , * c * bh @xmath0-bond and * d * bhb 2e3c bond of diborane , * e * so @xmath1-bond and * f * so @xmath0-bond of sulfur trioxide . ]    benzene : a straight application of the ibo construction produces the orbitals * a**e * shown in fig.[fig : benzeneibo ] . as expected , both the cc and the ch @xmath0-bonds of the system are completely localized , and can be be expressed to > 99% with iaos on only the two bonded centers . as a prototypical delocalized system , this does , however , not hold for the @xmath1 system .",
    "two aspects are important : ( i ) the three @xmath1 orbitals can not be expressed with iaos on less than four centers each ( in * c**e * having the weights 1.000 , 0.444 ( ortho ) , and 0.111 ( para ) ) , and ( ii ) there are two different maximal localizations of the functional eq .",
    ", orbitals * c**e * and orbitals * c**e * rotated by 60@xmath71 in real space .",
    "we had chosen to maximize @xmath72 instead of @xmath73 , there would even be a continuum of maximal localizations , also including orbitals * f**h * ( which look closer to classical @xmath1-bonds ) , and everything in between . in this case",
    "the classical resonance structure reflects the nature of the bonding well .",
    "cyclopropane : according to its lewis structure , cyclopropane is a simple alkane .",
    "however , due to the massive ring strain one could expect that some bonding effects are inevitable .",
    "nevertheless , if we calculate the ibos of this molecule ( fig.[fig : otheribo ] , * a * and * b * ) , we find six ch single bonds and three cc single bonds , all perfectly localized ( to > 99% ) on the two bonded centers , with no delocalization whatsoever .",
    "however , a closer look reveals that while the carbon part of the ch bond orbitals has about 28% @xmath74 character and 72% @xmath36 character , ( close to the ideal @xmath75 hybrid values of @xmath76 ) , the cc bonds only have 18% @xmath74 character and 82% @xmath36 character .",
    "so although they are localized single bonds , they must be considered an intermediate between a regular @xmath75-hybrid @xmath0-bond and a @xmath1-bond .",
    "this explains the well - known similarity in reactivity to alkenes .",
    "diborane : b@xmath77h@xmath65 has been a serious challenge to the classical bonding picture , with even scientists like pauling championing an ethane - like structure until proven wrong irrefutably.@xcite its bridged structure was popularized in 1943,@xcite and spawned investigations culminating in lipscomb s 1976 nobel price for his `` studies on the structure of boranes illuminating problems of chemical bonding '' .",
    "one could think that this molecule presents a challenge to a ibo bonding analysis .",
    "however , ibos are just the most local exact description of a first - principles wave function , and their construction does not make _ any _ reference to _ any _ perceived nature of the bonding .",
    "consequently , for ibo analysis diborane is not different than other molecules , and it uncovers diborane s two two - electron three - center bonds ( fig.[fig : otheribo]*d * ) just as its six standard @xmath0-bonds ( * c * ) , without any problems .",
    "sulfur trioxide : so@xmath42 is one of the simplest `` hypervalent '' molecules , apparently violating the octet rule . an ibo analysis finds two oxygen lone pairs , one @xmath0- and one @xmath1-bond ( fig.[fig : otheribo]*e * ) per oxygen . formally this calls for describing the so bonds as double bonds .",
    "however , the @xmath1-bonds have only a small bonding component ( 83% on oxygen , 15% on sulfur ) , so it is a matter of taste whether they should be called true @xmath1-bonds or not .",
    "but in any case , they are highly localized ( 98% on two centers ) and clearly not resonating , so the resonance structure        commonly found in textbooks  is at best misleading .- orbital participation need to be invoked . ]",
    "bifluoride anion : we see a similar discrepancy to textbook knowledge in the description of fhf@xmath51 .",
    "this molecule is alternatively cited as the strongest known hydrogen bond,@xcite or as an example for a 3-center 4-electron bond ( since an influential paper by pimentel@xcite ) .",
    "however , ibo anaylsis reveals that it can be perfectly described by six f lone pairs and two hf single bonds , all completely localized .",
    "since the bonds are highly polarized , there is again no violation of the octet rule : in fact , the h orbital has a population of only 0.6 electrons total ( out of the up to two electrons it theoretically could harbor ) , and the nature of bonding in this molecule is not very different than in hf .",
    "the proposed iaos offers a simple and transparent way to relate chemical intuition to quantum chemistry . in particular",
    ", the fact that most simple bonds can be expressed to > 99% with iaos on only two atoms strongly indicates that iaos can be interpreted as _ chemical _",
    "valence orbitals in molecules . that properties of individual such orbitals can then be directly calculated , as shown in fig.[fig : pedavssigmar ] , may turn out to be a decisive factor in future research on chemical reactivity .",
    "similarly , iaos may greatly simplify the construction of realistic tight - binding model hamiltonians and their use in eludicating complex correlated electronic structure phenomena.@xcite    the proposed ibos can help to uncover the nature of bonding in molecules  due to their unbiased nature also in unusual cases",
    ". however , the ibo construction s simplicity , ease of implementation , and high runtime efficiency make it an excellent choice also where localized orbitals are used for purely technical reasons ( e.g. , in local electron correlation methods ) .",
