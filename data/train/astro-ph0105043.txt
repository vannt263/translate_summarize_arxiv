    ", we exclusively used the dual amplifier readout mode . except for three longslit observations in 1997 february , the data were taken with slitmasks designed to obtain spectra for @xmath31 targets simultaneously .",
    "for the vast majority of observations , we used a 150 lines mm@xmath24 grating blazed at 7500  , which produces a @xmath32  pix@xmath24 dispersion .",
    "the spectral coverage with this grating is approximately 4000  to 1 micron , allowing us observe the entire optical window irrespective of the grating tilt or the location of the slit on the slitmask .",
    "we used a 300 lines mm@xmath24 grating blazed at 5000   ( 2.55  pix@xmath24 dispersion ) on one set of observations , a 400 lines mm@xmath24 grating blazed at 8500   ( 1.86  pix@xmath24 dispersion ) on two sets of observations , and a 600 lines mm@xmath24 grating blazed at 5000   ( 1.28  pix@xmath24 dispersion ) on one set of observations . for targets within the central hdf ( where the astrometric solutions are well  determined ) , we employed 1@xmath60 slits , yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath33 with the 150 lines mm@xmath24 grating . for targets outside of the hdf ( where the astrometric solutions are less well  determined ) , we employed 1@xmath65 slits , yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath34 with the 150 lines mm@xmath24 grating .",
    "the minimum set of exposures for any given target was 3 @xmath35 1800s .",
    "as the position angle of the slit for a particular target normally changed from observation to observation , only a small number ( @xmath36 ) of the serendipitous detections benefited from re  observation .",

    ", we used a dichroic with a cutoff at 6800  .",
    "together , the two channels in this set  up afforded a spectral coverage of roughly 3200   to 1 micron .",
    "again , we observed the entire optical window , but at almost twice the dispersion of our typical spectrograph configuration .",
    "we used the iraf package @xcite to process both the longslit and the slitmask data , following standard slit spectroscopy procedures .",
    "some aspects of treating the slitmask data were facilitated by a home  grown software package , bogusstern / homepage / bogus.html .",
    "] , created by d. stern , a.j .",
    "bunker , and s.a .",
    "wavelength calibrations were performed in the standard fashion using hg , ne , ar , and kr arc lamps ; we employed telluric sky lines to adjust the wavelength zero  point .",
    "we performed flux calibrations with longslit observations of standard stars from @xcite taken with the instrument in the same configuration as the relevant multislit observation .",
    "however , it should be noted that the absolute scale of the fluxed spectra must be regarded with caution .",
    "not all of the nights were photometric ; there may be substantial slit losses in the case of an extended source ; small errors in slitmask alignment cause additional light loss ; and since the position angle of an observation was set by the desire to maximize the number of targets on a mask , the observations were in general not made at or near parallactic angle .",
    "moreover , in the case of serendipitous detections , it is unlikely that the object is optimally aligned with the slit even when all other parameters are perfect .",
    "fortunately , it is merely the redshift of a given object  not the absolute flux or continuum shape  which is of interest at present .",
    "a serendipitous detection in spectroscopic data presents two challenges to the observer : ( 1 ) to locate on an image of the field the progenitor of the spectroscopic signature , and ( 2 ) to determine the nature of the object and , where possible , its redshift .",
    "we now address the former problem ; we discuss the latter in the following section .    in some respects , the process of cataloguing serendipitous detections proceeds backwards from the usual steps involved in compiling redshifts .",
    "generally , one begins with photometry for a galaxy whose location is known and subsequently obtains a spectrum . in our case , we began with a spectrum and worked backward to the progenitor s location and photometry . to accomplish this task , we combined what was known about the observation  the location of the target , the dimensions and orientation of the target slit , and the position of the target _ within _ the slit  and we reconstructed the position of the slit on the sky .",
    "we then mapped the reconstructed slit image to the target field and thereby identified _ a posteriori _ the objects which we in fact observed .    in the most favorable cases ,",
    "the two  dimensional spectra contained multiple serendipitous detections . by comparing the relative spatial separations between continuum detections in the two  dimensional spectra to the separations between sources on the slit image",
    ", we could uniquely identify each of the progenitors .",
    "even under unfavorable circumstance , in which the target was too faint to appear in the spectrum or was mis  aligned with the slit , the progenitor of a lone serendipitous detection could be identified by comparing its position on the two  dimensional spectrum to its position in the image relative to the edges of the slit .    to this end , the galaxies in the sample divide into two categories : those within the central hdf , and those without . for galaxies inside of the central hdf , we made the visual identification by mapping the slit image to the remarkably deep , well  resolved central @xmath9 images presented in w96 .",
    "we label the galaxies in table [ hdfz ] by their ids , isophotal magnitudes , and positions as given in that paper . if , on the other hand , the target slit extended outside of the central hdf , we relied on supporting photometry provided by the single ",
    "orbit @xmath9 flanking field images of w96 , the deep hawaii 2.2 m @xmath15 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 images of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b99 ) , or the deep @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 images of @xcite .",
    "since there is no existing nomenclature for sources beyond the central hdf , we adopted a labeling scheme in table [ ffz ] based on the galaxy positions .    to facilitate this position  based nomenclature for serendipitous observations of galaxies in the flanking fields and beyond , we computed an astrometric solution to the hawaii 2.2 m @xmath37band image of b99 . from a fit to 72 objects in a 10 @xmath35 10 portion of the digitized poss  ii plates ( obtained via the digitized sky survey )",
    ", we found a platescale of 0@xmath6189 pixel@xmath24 and an orientation angle of 0.630 , both of which are consistent with the values reported by b99 .",
    "the dispersion in the fit was 0@xmath622 in the right ascension ( ra ) direction and 0@xmath626 in the declination ( dec ) direction , giving a total error of 0@xmath637 .",
    "this error is comparable to the error reported by b99 . as a check to the fit",
    ", we compared the ra and dec positions of 10 objects in the central hdf as given by w96 against our newly computed hawaii 2.2 m @xmath37band positions and found a mean absolute offset of 0@xmath611 in ra and 0@xmath616 in dec , for a total mean offset of 0@xmath620 .",
    "this error is smaller than the sum in quadrature of the total dispersion in our fit and the accuracy of the w96 absolute astrometry ( reported as good to approximately 0@xmath64 ) , suggesting that our reported ra and dec positions themselves are good to roughly 0@xmath64 .    in three cases ,",
    "the serendipitous detection fell outside of the hawaii 2.2 m fields . to visually identify these objects , we utilized our own 70 minute @xmath42band image taken with the echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on ut 2000 may 05 .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed account of the observation and data reduction .",
    "the astrometric solution for the position  based nomenclature was determined exactly as described for the hawaii 2.2 m image ; @xmath43 magnitudes are not available for these detections . in five cases ,",
    "the progenitor of a serendipitous spectroscopic detection was too faint to be detected in any of the supporting imaging .",
    "nonetheless , we were able to estimate a position for the source by extrapolating from the known position of the target and the dimensions and orientation of the target slit .",
    "we have indicated such cases on table [ ffz ] .      for each member of the serendipitous catalog , we measured the redshift by visually inspecting the spectrum and noting the wavelengths of spectral features . for objects with multiple strong emission lines ,",
    "the proper interpretation of the spectral features was unambiguous and the assignment of their rest wavelengths was straightforward .",
    "the situation was more difficult for faint objects showing only absorption lines .",
    "if such a spectrum did not conform to the standard pattern of balmer lines and the h@xmath44k doublet seen in the vicinity of the 4000   break ( d4000 ) , then it was generally impossible to determine a redshift .",
    "the most common type of serendipitous detection involved the presence of a single emission line , the interpretation of which can problematic .",
    "in general , a single , isolated line could be any one of ly@xmath0 , [ ] @xmath453727 , h@xmath46 , [ ] @xmath455007 , or h@xmath0 , though given sufficient spectral coverage , most erroneous interpretations can be ruled out .",
    "for instance , the absence of h@xmath46 or [ ] @xmath454959  serves to discount the interpretation of a solo line as [ ] @xmath455007 .",
    "similarly , lines that are bluer than rest h@xmath0 can not be h@xmath0 themselves , and the presence of h@xmath46 or [ ] @xmath455007would be expected for a solo line redder than rest h@xmath0 ( but see stockton & ridgway 1998 ) . hence",
    ", the primary threat to determining one  line redshifts is the potential for mis  identifying ly@xmath0 as [ ] @xmath453727  or vice versa .",
    "unfortunately , with low dispersion spectra it is often impossible to distinguish between the high equivalent width forms of these emission lines without a pronounced continuum depression or a line asymmetry , both characteristic of ly@xmath0 . for two accounts of the potential pitfalls associated with one  line spectroscopic redshift identifications ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .    in part",
    "to reflect the uncertainty in interpreting solo lines , we divide the serendipitous detections into five spectral categories ( sc ) based on their general morphology .",
    "table [ qc ] lists the spectral categories with a brief description of each .",
    "the spectra of category 1 sources show multiple features which can be uniquely identified , yielding secure redshift determinations .",
    "the spectra of category 2 sources show a solo emission line in the presence of strong continuum both redward and blueward of the line .",
    "such lines were identified as [ ] @xmath453727 , and the redshift determination is considered secure .",
    "the spectra of category 3 sources show a solo emission line redward of a strong continuum break .",
    "such lines were identified as ly@xmath0 and the continuum breaks were interpreted as the onset of absorption by the ly@xmath0forest ( which causes significantly diminished flux shortward of 1216  ) . of course , especially in star  forming systems ,",
    "the continuum in the vicinity [ ] @xmath453727can also show a break  the balmer break at 4000    and in cases of low signal  to  noise , the morphology of the balmer break alone is not sufficient to distinguish it from the break at ly@xmath0 .",
    "fortunately , for galaxies at @xmath47 , the break at ly@xmath0 is expected to be of greater amplitude than the largest observed d4000 amplitudes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "12 ) , so the two features can be easily discerned . at lower redshifts ,",
    "however , the amplitude of the two breaks may be comparable , and without corroborating spectral features the redshift identification is largely subjective .",
    "of five category 3 sources in this catalog , two are at @xmath47 , one has a redshift which is confirmed by other authors , and one has supporting photometric redshifts from two other authors ; their redshift determinations are considered secure .",
    "the redshift of the remaining category 3 source should be considered tentative , as indicated on table [ ffz ] .",
    "example spectra for categories 1 , 2 , and 3 are shown in figure [ qc1_3 ] .",
    "the spectra of category 4 objects show an isolated emission in the absence of any continuum , which generally suggests a weak detection of either [ ] @xmath453727  or ly@xmath0 . clearly , the confidence one can exercise in discriminating between these two cases is a strong function of the robustness of the detection , the resolution of the spectrum , and the availability of supporting imaging .",
    "see  [ highz ] for a detailed discussion of the redshift determination of a typical category 4 source .",
    "example spectra for both interpretations of category 4 sources are shown in figure [ qc4 ] .",
    "the spectra of category 5 sources show a continuum break .",
    "such breaks were classified as either the balmer break or as ly@xmath0forest absorption according to the strength of the continuum blueward of the break .",
    "example spectra for both interpretations of category 5 are shown in figure [ qc5 ] .",
    "the redshift determinations of both category 4 and category 5 sources are considered secure unless otherwise indicated .",
    "serendipitous detections about which we were unable to attain a reasonable degree of confidence were omitted from the catalog ; nearly half of the initial sample of 121 serendipitous detections were rejected for this reason .    to minimize the possibility that we mis  classified the solo emission line of a low  redshift category 4 source as high ",
    "redshift ly@xmath0 , we checked that the source as visually identified in the hawaii 2.2 m @xmath37band image of b99 did not also appear in the @xmath41band image of @xcite . in this fashion",
    ", we ensured that the @xmath41band flux of the source in question was severely attenuated by the hydrogen forest , consistent with @xmath47 .",
    "we discovered one erroneous redshift determination with this technique : f 362651443 was marginally detected in 1999 june such that [ ] @xmath455007  appeared in the two  dimensional spectrum as a solo emission line at @xmath48  , and the line was initially mis  classified as high ",
    "redshift ly@xmath0 at @xmath49 .",
    "however , the presence of the progenitor in the @xmath42band image of @xcite ruled out the tantalizing high  redshift interpretation , and subsequent targeted spectroscopy revealed a spectrum with [ ] @xmath453727 , [ ] @xmath454959 , [ ] @xmath455007 , h@xmath46 , and h@xmath50 in emission at @xmath51 .    in the event that a redshift for a serendipitous detection remained undetermined ,",
    "one possibility is that the object lies in the so  called  redshift desert , \" the interval spanning roughly @xmath52 .",
    "the limits of this interval are set by the fact that at higher redshifts ly@xmath0 would fall on the detector , and at lower redshifts the oxygen lines and/or the balmer lines would fall on on the detector . at intermediate redshifts ,",
    "however , there is a dearth of prominent spectral features , rendering redshift determination difficult .",
    "a second possibility is that the object does have spectral features which are in principle observable , except that the features fall in a region heavily contaminated by night sky emission .",
    "as sky subtraction is particularly problematic at @xmath53   for low signal  to  noise , low dispersion spectra , it is reasonable to conclude that at least a few redshifts were lost to this effect .",
    "it should be noted that for the @xmath36 cases in which a single galaxy was multiply observed , the agreement in the individual redshifts was excellent .",
    "discrepancies never exceeded @xmath54 .",
    "we present the catalog of serendipitously detected galaxies in table [ hdfz ] and table [ ffz ] .",
    "table [ hdfz ] contains 25 galaxies located in the hdf proper , identified by their w96 number as described in the preceding section .",
    "the @xmath9 magnitude is the isophotal magnitude given by w96 , and the ra and dec are j2000 coordinates , also given therein .",
    "the spectral category was assigned as described in  3.1 ; also see table [ qc ] .",
    "table [ ffz ] contains 49 galaxies located outside the central hdf , identified by their positions as described in the preceding section .",
    "the 30 galaxies located in the hdf flanking fields are indicated .",
    "the isophotal @xmath43 magnitudes were determined by running the source extraction algorithm sextractor @xcite on the hawaii 2.2 m @xmath37band image of b99 .",
    "we estimated the @xmath55 zero  point by using stars in the central hdf ; as such , the uncertainty in the @xmath43 is @xmath56 mag .",
    "all spectral lines in both tables are emission lines unless otherwise noted .",
    "the 74 galaxies in the serendipitous catalog span the redshift range @xmath57 , with a median redshift of @xmath2 .",
    "the vast majority of the galaxies are emission - line systems ; 5% of the sample show only absorption lines .",
    "this bias stems from the diminished likelihood of serendipitously detecting an absorption  line system with sufficient signal  to  noise to allow the redshift to be determined .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainty in the most secure redshifts ( sc 1 ) is @xmath58 . the uncertainty in redshifts based on solo emission lines or continuum breaks ( sc 2 to 5 )  assuming the identification of the spectral feature is sound",
    " is @xmath59 .",
    "for the 12 galaxies in the central hdf also observed spectroscopically by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite , we compared our spectroscopic redshift to the published value and found that the agreement was excellent , with a mean deviation of @xmath60 and a dispersion of @xmath61 . in all cases ,",
    "the discrepancy is comparable to our estimated measurement error .",
    "the redshift distribution of the serendipitous catalog , compared with a  total sample \" consisting of this sample , all published redshifts for galaxies in the central hdf , and 26 published redshifts for galaxies flanking the central hdf , is shown in figures [ histo_full ] and [ histo_short ] .",

    "the histogram displayed in figure [ histo_full ] displays the total range of redshifts of the combined catalogs , @xmath62 , with a comparatively coarse resolution of @xmath63 .",
    "given the caveat that we are insensitive to galaxies in the redshift range @xmath52 ( cf .  ",
    "3.1 ) , we find that the redshift distribution of the serendipitous sample closely follows that of the total sample .",
    "to investigate the redshift clustering properties of the serendipitous sample , we display the redshift distribution for the galaxies in the range @xmath64 with a resolution of @xmath65 in figure [ histo_short ] .",
    "the figure shows clear evidence of clustering in both the serendipitous sample and the total sample .",
    "moreover , the clustering present in the total sample is mirrored almost perfectly by that present in the serendipitous sample . assuming a fixed number of galaxies per redshift bin ( i.e.  no evolution in bin membership with redshift )",
    ", we find a @xmath66 peak in the serendipitous sample at @xmath67 , a @xmath68 peak at @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and a @xmath71 peak at @xmath72 . in total",
    ", we find that 17 out of the 51 serendipitous galaxies ( 33% ) fall into peaks significant at greater than 97.5% confidence .",
    "this figure compares favorably with that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c96 ) , who find that 57 out of 140 ( 41% ) of their sample of spectroscopically observed hdf galaxies fall into redshift peaks .",
    "that the locations of our peaks vary somewhat from those in c96 is not surprising . whereas c96 chose redshift bins of variable centers and widths so as to maximize their significance relative to occurring by chance in a smoothed velocity distribution , we chose fixed bin centers and widths , cf .",
    "even so , our peaks centered on @xmath73 and @xmath70 no doubt reflect the same structures revealed by the peaks in c96 at @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "we find no evidence of periodicity in the peak redshifts , as described by @xcite .    beyond the strong evidence of redshift clustering , there are two outstanding features of the redshift distribution of the serendipitous sample . first , there is a relative deficiency of serendipitous detections at @xmath76 .",
    "second , the redshift peak centered on @xmath77 evident in the total sample is not represented in the serendipitous sample . taken together , these features appear to suggest a selection effect which excludes galaxies at @xmath76 from serendipitous detection .",
    "however , since this redshift range is perfectly accessible to lris via the balmer lines and by [ ] and [ ] emission , it is likely that the scarcity of low  redshift galaxies in the serendipitous catalog is merely the combined effect of : ( 1 ) the increasingly small cosmological volume surveyed at low ",
    "redshift , ( 2 ) the comparatively small size of the serendipitous catalog , and ( 3 ) the fact that the hdf was selected to be devoid of bright galaxies in the first place . at a minimum ,",
    "these facts make it impossible to comment on the significance of the apparent @xmath78 deficiency .",
    "photometric redshift techniques have become an essential tool of observational cosmology , with applications ranging from determining luminosity functions to selecting high  redshift candidates for spectroscopy .",
    "we have utilized our set of spectroscopic redshifts for 23 of the 25 serendipitously detected galaxies in the central hdf to carry out a test of the photometric redshifts presented by @xcite , who employ a maximum  likelihood analysis applied to spectral energy distribution ",

    "the source has a comparatively steep radio spectral index ( @xmath117 ; @xmath118 ) , and the radio emission extends across 2@xmath68 . in general , microjansky radio emission from disk galaxies can result from either star formation ( e.g.from free  free emission originating in regions ) or from agn activity connected with a central engine .",
    "@xcite argued that ( 1 ) in the case of a central agn powering a weak ( @xmath119 w hz@xmath24 ) radio source , the bulk of the radio emission is confined to the nuclear region and is therefore characterized by sub ",
    "arcsecond angular scales , and ( 2 ) such small scales result in a high opacity to synchrotron self  absorption , yielding flat or inverted spectral indices typically in the range @xmath120 .",
    "hence , the origin of the radio emission in cxohdfn j123635.6@xmath44621424 was taken to be extended star  forming regions .",
    "this conclusion was ostensibly borne out by an _ infrared space observatory _ camera ( isocam ) detection of the source @xcite . if the source were a moderate  to  low redshift starburst galaxy ( as suggested by hornschemeier 2001 , owing to the object s spatial extent ) , the isocam 15 @xmath83 m filter ( lw3 ) would sample rest wavelengths from roughly 6 @xmath83 m to 12 @xmath83 m ; the mid  infrared emission",
    "could therefore be plausibly attributed to the unidentified infrared bands ( uib ) and to the hot , 200 k dust which typically dominates the spectral energy distribution of starbursts over those wavelengths @xcite .    in contradistinction to the foregoing conclusions , both the optical and x  ray properties of cxohdfn j123635.6@xmath44621424 indicate the presence of agn activity .",

    "the fit was made to the continuum source only blueward of the emission line so that after subtraction  assuming a locally flat spectrum for both sources  any remaining flux could be attributed to the high  redshift candidate . in this fashion we hoped to isolate continuum flux from the high  redshift source and recover a continuum break , which would lend credence to the ly@xmath0interpretation . however , as can be seen in the one  dimensional extracted spectrum ( figure [ oned ] ) , the continuum break is of low significance relative to the noise .    as the emission line itself is not obviously asymmetric , the remaining evidence in favor of the ly@xmath0interpretation is two  fold .",
    "to begin , the observed frame equivalent width of the line is @xmath145  .",

    "in the course of our on  going program to study distant galaxies in the hdf , we have produced as a fringe benefit a deep , serendipitous slit spectroscopy survey sensitive to a wide range of redshifts .",
