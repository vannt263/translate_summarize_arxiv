    "phase transitions are universal phenomena which have been theoretically understood at the thermodynamic limit of infinite systems as anomalies in the associated equation of state ( eos ) .",

    "as an example figure 1 shows a first order phase transition i.e. a jump in the average energy @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 being the canonical partition sum , as a function of the conjugate intensive variable @xmath3 .     presenting a discontinuity characteristic of a first order phase transition for an infinite system ( thin line ) while it remains continuous in a finite system ( thick line ) .",
    "]    however , most of the systems studied in physics do not correspond to this mathematical limit of infinite systems@xcite and , in fact , finite systems are now , per se , a subject of a very intense research activity , from metallic clusters@xcite to bose condensates@xcite , from nanoscopic systems@xcite to atomic nuclei @xcite and elementary particles@xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic potentials of a finite system in a finite volume are analytic functions . as a consequence ,",
    "the average energy varies continuously with the temperature and can not present a jump .",
    "the transition looks like a crossover ( see fig .",
    "thus , it is often concluded that phase transitions can only be defined for infinite systems .",
    "this situation can be thought as unsatisfactory , since on one hand the thermodynamic limit does not exist in nature , and on the other hand the understanding of mesoscopic systems is becoming one of the most challenging field in physics  @xcite .    in the recent years",
    ", many efforts have been devoted to give the theoretical foundations for the definition of phase transitions in small systems and explicitly make the bridge between possible anomalies in finite systems and the usual definition of phase transitions at the thermodynamical limit @xcite .",

    "the first step is to make the link between the partition sum and the event distribution .",
    "taking the example of a canonical ensemble both quantities are directly related to the density of states @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 therefore , introducing a reference temperature @xmath9 we get @xmath10 i.e. the partition sum is the laplace transform of the event distribution .",

    "this is only true for finite systems since at the thermodynamic limit the distribution @xmath12 becomes a delta function which contains information only about the temperature @xmath9 ( as required by the theorem of ensembles equivalence ) .",
    "using ( [ eq : laplace - p ] ) one can show that a set of zeroes converging and aligning perpendicularly to the reel temperature axis , as required by the yang - lee theorem , is equivalent to a probability distribution split at least in 2 equivalent components ( bimodal ) , separated by an energy inversely proportional to the density of zeroes close to the real axis , @xmath5 directly proportional to the number of particles @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting finite energy jump per particle is the latent heat .",
    "* bimodality of the event distribution and negative heat capacity . *",
    "alternative definitions of phase transitions in finite systems have been proposed .",
    "it has been claimed that first order phase transitions in finite systems can be related to a negative microcanonical heat capacity  @xcite or more generally to an inverted curvature of the thermodynamic potential as a function of an observable which can then be seen as an order parameter  @xcite .",
    "these anomalies can also be connected to the general topology of the potential energy surface  @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that this definition of phase transitions can be used only inan ensemble in which an extensive variable@xcite playing the role of an order parameter is controlled ( extensive ensemble ) since it is based on the curvature anomalies of the associated thermodynamical potential as a function of the controlled extensive variable .",
    "conversely , both the yang - lee and the bimodality pictures require that the extensive variables are not directly controlled but are free to fluctuate being constrained only by a lagrange multiplier .",
    "this corresponds to the associated intensive ensemble . in this",
    "sense definitions based on negative curvatures or on bimodalities ( or on the zeroes of the partition sum ) are complementary , since they can not be applied to the same ensemble .",
    "we have demonstrated that these two pictures are equivalent and are the manifestation of the same phenomenon in two different ensembles@xcite .",
    "this can be easily demonstrated .",
    "let us take the energy as a typical extensive variable",
    ". the inverted curvature definition of a first order phase transition is nothing but the occurrence of a negative heat capacity in the microcanonical ensemble , while the bimodality should be looked for in the canonical energy distribution .",
    "however , using the definition of the microcanonical entropy @xmath14 and of the canonical energy distribution @xmath15 one can directly show that they are intimately related by the equality @xmath16 the above relation is valid for every temperature @xmath17 and every energy @xmath18 , meaning that in a finite system the energy probability a single temperature is in principle enough to access the whole entropy functional .",

    "the log of the energy distributions is presented .",
    "the calculation is performed close to the transition temperature , and the distribution is bimodal as expected . because of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p - s ] ) this figure also represents the entropy ( with a linear behavior @xmath22 subtracted ) ; its derivative is the microcanonical temperature @xmath23 @xmath24 and its curvature the inverse of a heat capacity @xmath25 the bimodality is nothing but a convex intruder in the entropy curve , which produces a back bending in the microcanonical caloric curve and a negative branch in the heat capacity ( see figure [ fig : lattice - gas - p - s - t - c ] ) .    for comparison on the microcanonical caloric curve of fig .",
    "( [ fig : lattice - gas - p - s - t - c ] ) we also present the canonical average and most probable energies . in the back - bending",
    "the canonical distribution is bimodal so that the most probable energy is discontinuous ( big dots ) and so is presenting the energy jump characteristic of a first order phase transition .",
    "conversely the usual canonical caloric curve which relates the average energy to the temperature takes the whole back bending region ( i.e. the whole range of temperatures exhibiting a bimodal energy distribution ) to go smoothly from the gas to the liquid ( dotted line ) .      * negative heat capacity and abnormal kinetic energy fluctuations . *    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have proposed to use the fluctuations of the kinetic energy to deduce the microcanonical heat capacity and we have shown that a negative heat capacity results in an abnormally large energy fluctuation . this can be easily explained for a classical fluid and tested in the framework of the lattice - gas model .",
    "the total energy @xmath18 of the considered system can be decomposed into two independent components , its kinetic and potential energy : @xmath26 in a microcanonical ensemble with a total energy @xmath27 the total degeneracy factor @xmath28 is thus simply given by the folding product of the individual degeneracy factors @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "one can then define for the total system as well as for the two subsystems the microcanonical temperatures @xmath31 and the associated heat capacities @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) .",
    "if we now look at the kinetic energy distribution when the total energy is @xmath18 we get    @xmath35    then the most probable kinetic energy @xmath36 for the total energy @xmath18 is defined by the equality of the partial microcanonical temperatures @xmath37 .",
    "the most probable kinetic energy @xmath38 can be used as a microcanonical thermometer . using a gaussian approximation for @xmath39",
    "the kinetic energy variance can be calculated as @xcite    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the microcanonical heat capacities calculated for the most probable energy partition .",
    "equation ( [ eq : sigma ] ) can be inverted to extract from the observed fluctuations the heat capacity    @xmath43    where we have introduced the canonical kinetic energy fluctuation @xmath44 this expression shows that when @xmath42 diverges and then becomes negative , @xmath45 remains positive but overcomes the canonical expectation @xmath46 .",

    "one can clearly see that the fluctuations are abnormally large in the coexistence region up to the critical temperature . from fig .",
    "[ fig_bologne4 ] it is apparent that the phase transition signal is visible in the temperature ( back - bending ) as well as in the fluctuation observable ( normalized fluctuations larger than @xmath51 .    the right part of the figure presents examples of expected behavior of the temperature as a function of energy at a constant pressure or a constant average volume in the subcritical region . at constant pressure",
    "a back - bending is clearly seen . on the other hand at constant average volume",
    "a smooth behavior is observed with a slope change entering the gas phase .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath50 parameter varies rapidly in the coexistence region . from these examples one",
    "clearly sees that the various transformations lead to very different caloric curves .",
    "more generally , it is clear that the back - bending of the temperature surface can be avoided depending on the path of the considered transformation and the phase transition signal can be hidden in the observation of the caloric curve .    on the other side partial energy fluctuations",
    "are a state variable which does not depend on the transformation from one state to another and can directly give access to the equation of state : the anomalously large fluctuation signal will be always seen if the system undergoes a first order phase transition , independent of the path .",
    "as an example the lower part of figure 5 shows a constant @xmath52 or @xmath53 cut of the bidimensional fluctuation surface .",
    "the quantitative behavior of the heat capacity as a function of energy depends on the specific transformation , but at each point the heat capacity extracted from fluctuations is a direct measure of the underlying equation of state .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated in the medium part of figure [ fig_bologne4 ] which compares the exact heat capacity @xmath54 with the fluctuation approximation .",
    "the agreement between the two results illustrates the accuracy of the estimation ( 14 ) .",
    "phase transitions are universal properties of matter in interaction .",
    "they have been widely studied in the thermodynamical limit of infinite systems . however , in many physical situations this limit can not be accessed and so phase transitions should be reconsidered from a more general point of view .",
    "this is for example the case of matter under long range forces like gravitation .",
    "even if these self gravitating systems are very large they can not be considered as infinite because of the non saturating nature of the force .",
    "other cases are provided by microscopic or mesoscopic systems built out of matter which is known to present phase transitions .",
    "metallic clusters can melt before being vaporized .",
    "quantum fluid may undergo bose condensation or super - fluid phase transition .",
    "dense hadronic matter should merge in a quark and gluon plasma phase while nuclei are expected to exhibit a liquid -gas phase transition .",
    "for all these systems the theoretical and experimental issue is how to sign a possible phase transition in a finite system .    in this paper",
    "we have shown that phase transitions can be uniquely defined for finite systems .",
    "depending upon the statistical ensemble one should look for different signals . in the ensemble where the order parameter is free to fluctuate ( intensive ensemble ) the topology of the event distribution",
    "should be studied .",
    "a bimodal distribution signals a first order phase transition .",
    "this occurrence of a bimodal distribution is equivalent to the alignment of the partition sum zeroes as described by the yang and lee theorem . in the associated extensive ensemble ,",
    "the bimodality condition is equivalent to the requirement of a convexity anomaly in the thermodynamic potential .",
    "the melting of sodium clusters@xcite , the fragmentation of hydrogen clusters@xcite , the pairing in nuclei@xcite and nuclear multifragmentation@xcite .",
    "however , much more experimental and theoretical studies are now expected to progress in this new field of phase transitions in finite systems .                                in this paper",
    "the word  extensive  is used in the general sens of resulting from an observation and not in the restricted sense of additive variable .",
