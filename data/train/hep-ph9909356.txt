    "the top and bottom quark masses are very important phenomenological quantities .",
    "two prominent examples which illustrate that we need to know them to a high degree of precision are virtual top quark effects in electroweak precision observables and b decay phenomenology : the top quark indirectly affects the relation between the @xmath4 , @xmath5 masses , and the weak mixing angle @xmath6 through loop effects which are usually parameterised by the quantity @xmath7 .",
    "future improvements in the determination of @xmath8 at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and linear collider ( lc ) make it desirable to push the error in the top quark mass much below the level of a gev in order to get stringent bounds on the higgs boson mass which enters the relation among the electroweak precision observables only logarithmically .",
    "thus the analysis of electroweak precision observables is complementary to direct higgs searches and provides an important test of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the bottom quark mass enters the inclusive b meson decay rates as the fifth power , @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the errors in the bottom quark mass should be at the percent level ( i.e. not more than 50 mev ) , if ckm matrix elements like @xmath10 shall be determined with an error of a few percent from inclusive decays .    using continuum qcd and perturbative methods",
    "the most accurate and precise determinations of the top and bottom quark masses have and will come from observables involving the @xmath11 and @xmath12 thresholds . whereas hadron colliders , which determine the top quark mass from a reconstructed b - w invariant mass distribution , will have a very hard time to reduce the top mass error below 2 gev due to large systematic uncertainties , a lineshape scan of the total ( colour singlet ) @xmath11 cross section close to threshold at the lc will easily determine the top mass with a combined statistical and systematical _ experimental _ uncertainty of order 100 mev  @xcite .",
    "the question is whether one can provide a theoretical description of the threshold lineshape which allows for _ theoretical _ uncertainties in the top mass extraction of the same order ( or maybe better ) .",
    "for the bottom quark mass , on the other hand , the most precise determinations come from sum rule calculations using the experimental data on the @xmath13 mesons  @xcite . a quick look at the presently available bottom quark mass determinations  @xcite , however , seems to indicate that a bottom quark mass uncertainty of around 50 mev is out of question . observing the spread of numbers given in",
    "@xcite an uncertainty of 150 - 200 mev seems to be more realistic .    on the other hand , when talking about quark masses we have to keep in mind that , due to confinement , they are not observables , but parameters multiplying the bilinear @xmath14 operators in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "thus , they are always determined indirectly , and our ability to determine them with high precision and their usefulness for practical applications can depend on the cleverness of their definition . in this",
    "talk i report on recent studies using half the perturbative contributions of a heavy quark - antiquark @xmath0 , @xmath1 bound state as a new heavy quark mass definition .",
    "this new scheme is called the _ @xmath2 scheme _  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 mass is a _ short - distance mass _ , i.e. it does not contain an ambiguity of order @xmath15 and the problem of large higher order corrections associated with a pole in the borel transform at @xmath16 like the pole mass .",
    "but , unlike the well known @xmath17 mass , which we might consider as the proto - type of a short - distance mass , the @xmath2 mass is specialised for problems where the characteristic scale is smaller than the quark mass  a region where the @xmath17 mass loses its conceptual meaning . by construction",
    ", the @xmath2 scheme is the optimal choice for problems involving non - relativistic @xmath11 and @xmath12 systems , and one can expect that the @xmath2 mass can be determined from them with small uncertainties .",
    "i will demonstrate the advantages of the @xmath2 mass compared to the pole and the @xmath17 scheme for the nnlo calculations of the total @xmath11 cross section close to threshold at the lc  @xcite and a sum rule determination of the bottom quark mass  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath2 mass scheme also works well for non-@xmath3 problems like inclusive @xmath18 meson decays .",
    "it also allows for a more refined determination of the @xmath17 mass . if the @xmath2 scheme would not be applicable for non-@xmath3 system it would be of little practical value . in order to apply the @xmath2 mass scheme to non-@xmath3 systems a modified perturbative expansion , called the _ upsilon expansion _",
    "@xcite , has to be employed .",
