    "deformation of the nuclear shape from spherical symmetric one has long been one of the most important issues in nuclear structure physics . among them , searches for evidences of the triaxial ( @xmath2 or @xmath0 ) one have been pursued long time , for example , the even - odd energy staggering in the low - spin part of the @xmath0 bands  @xcite , the signature dependence of the energy spectra and the @xmath3 transition rates in medium - spin odd - odd and odd-@xmath4 nuclei  @xcite , properties of the @xmath5 isomers  @xcite , and so on .",
    "but their results have not been conclusive ; making a clear distinction between the static and the dynamic ( vibrational ) ones has not been successful up to now .",
    "theoretically , appearance of the wobbling motion , which is well - known in classical mechanics of asymmetric tops  @xcite and whose quantum analog was discussed in terms of a rotor model about thirty years ago  @xcite , is a decisive evidence of static triaxial deformations .",
    "subsequently its microscopic descriptions were developed by several authors  @xcite .",
    "since the small - amplitude wobbling mode carries the same quantum numbers , parity @xmath6 and signature @xmath7 , as the odd - spin members of the @xmath0 band , ref.@xcite anticipated that it would appear as a high - spin continuation of the @xmath0 band , but it has not been resolved that in what nuclei , at what spins , and with what @xmath0 wobbling modes would be observed .",
    "shimizu and matsuyanagi  @xcite and onishi  @xcite performed extensive numerical calculations for normally - deformed er isotopes with relatively small @xmath8 .",
    "matsuzaki  @xcite , shimizu and matsuzaki  @xcite , and horibata and onishi  @xcite also studied @xmath9os with relatively large negative-@xmath0 but their correspondence to experimental information has not been very clear .",
    "these studies indicate the necessity of high - spin states in stably and strongly @xmath0-deformed nuclei .",
    "bengtsson studied high - spin states around @xmath10hf  @xcite and found systematic existence of the tsd ( triaxial super- or strongly deformed ) states with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this confirmed the discussion on the shell gap at @xmath13 in ref.@xcite , the work in which the yrast tsd band in @xmath14lu was reported ; and in 2000 an excited tsd band was observed in this nucleus and from the strengths of the interband @xmath15 transition rates this was unambiguously identified with the wobbling motion  @xcite .",
    "this data was analyzed by using a particle - rotor model  @xcite and the @xmath15 transition rates were reproduced well . subsequently tsd bands were found in some lu and hf isotopes and wobbling excitations were observed also in @xmath16lu  @xcite",
    ". a close look at these data , however , tells us that the sign of their @xmath0-deformation seems to contradict to an irrotational motion and that the unexpected behavior of the wobbling frequency has not been explained yet .",
    "thus in the preceding rapid communication  @xcite we presented an answer to these problems . in the present paper , after summarizing the discussion there we extend numerical analyses to elucidate it .",
    "an emphasis is put on the behavior of the calculated dynamic moments of inertia .",
    "we start from a one - body hamiltonian in the rotating frame , @xmath17 in eq.([hsp ] ) , @xmath18 and 2 stand for neutron and proton , respectively , and chemical potentials @xmath19 are determined so as to give correct average particle numbers @xmath20 . the oscillator frequencies in eq.([hnil ] )",
    "are expressed by the quadrupole deformation parameters @xmath21 and @xmath0 in the usual way .",
    "they are treated as parameters as well as pairing gaps @xmath22 .",
    "the orbital angular momentum @xmath23 in eq.([hnil ] ) is defined in the singly - stretched coordinates @xmath24 , with @xmath25 1  3 denoting @xmath26 ",
    "@xmath27 , and the corresponding momenta . by diagonalizing @xmath28 at each @xmath29",
    ", we obtain quasiparticle ( qp ) orbitals and the nuclear yrast ( 0qp ) state .",
    "since @xmath28 conserves parity @xmath30 and signature @xmath31 , nuclear states can be labeled by them .",
    "nuclear states with qp excitations are obtained by exchanging the qp energy and wave functions such as @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the signature partner of @xmath34 .",
    "we perform the random phase approximation ( rpa ) to the residual pairing plus doubly - stretched quadrupole - quadrupole ( @xmath35 ) interaction between qps . since we are interested in the wobbling motion that has a definite quantum number , @xmath36 , only two components out of five of the @xmath35 interaction are relevant .",
    "they are given by @xmath37 where the doubly - stretched quadrupole operators are defined by @xmath38 and those with good signature are @xmath39 the residual pairing interaction does not contribute because @xmath40 is an operator with @xmath41 .",
    "the equation of motion , @xmath42_\\mathrm{rpa } = \\hbar\\omega_n x_n^\\dagger , \\ ] ] for the eigenmode @xmath43 leads to a pair of coupled equations for the transition amplitudes @xmath44\\right\\rangle .\\ ] ] then , by assuming @xmath45 , this can be cast  @xcite into the form @xmath46 \\notag \\\\ = 0 , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which is independent of @xmath47s .",
    "this expression proves that the spurious ( nambu  goldstone ) mode given by the first factor and all nomal modes given by the second are decoupled from each other . here",
    "@xmath48 as usual and the detailed expressions of @xmath49 are given in refs.@xcite . among normal modes ,",
    "one obtains @xmath50 by putting @xmath51 .",
    "note that this gives a real excitation only when the right - hand side is positive and it is non - trivial whether a collective solution appears or not .",
    "evidently this coincides with the form derived by bohr and mottelson in a rotor model  @xcite and known in classical mechanics  @xcite , aside from the crucial feature that the moments of inertia are @xmath29-dependent in the present case .",
    "one drawback in our formulation is that our @xmath52 tends to be larger than corresponding experimental values because of the spurious velocity dependence of the nilsson potential as discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "a remedy for this was discussed there but that for @xmath53 has not been devised yet . therefore we assume for the present a similar discussion holds for the latter and accordingly the ratio @xmath54 which actually determines @xmath55 is more reliable than their absolute magnitudes .",
    "interband electric quadrupole transitions between the @xmath56-th excited band and the yrast are given as @xmath57 in terms of @xmath58 they will be abbreviated to @xmath59 later for simplicity . in - band ones are given as @xmath60 in terms of @xmath61 and assumed to be common to all bands .",
    "they will be abbreviated to @xmath62 .",
    "here we adopted a high - spin approximation  @xcite .",
    "the transition quadrupole moment @xmath63 is extracted from @xmath62 by the usual rotor - model prescription .    to compare collectivities of these two types of @xmath15 transitions",
    ", we introduce a pair of deformation parameters @xmath64 then it is evident that the in - band one is expressed as @xmath65 as for the interband ones , by expanding @xmath66 by @xmath67s and @xmath68s , where @xmath56 runs both normal modes and the nambu ",
    "goldstone mode @xmath69 , we obtain from @xmath70=0 $ ] a kind of sum rule @xmath71 consecutively introducing the ratios of the dynamic to static deformations , @xmath72 the sum rule above reads @xmath73 the dynamic amplitudes @xmath74 describe shape fluctuations associated with the vibrational motion in the uniformly rotating frame .",
    "transformation to the body - fixed ( principal - axis ) frame  @xcite turns the shape fluctuation into the fluctuation of the angular momentum vector , i.e. , the wobbling motion .",
    "this transformation relates the ratios , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , to the moments of inertia  @xcite : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a real amplitude that relates the dynamic amplitude @xmath74 and the moment of inertia , @xmath79 is the sign of @xmath80 ( so @xmath81 for wobbling - like rpa solutions ) , and @xmath82 thus , the interband @xmath83 is rewritten as , @xmath84 ^ 2 , \\label{be2wob}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which coincides with the formula given by the rotor model  @xcite , except for the appearance of the amplitude @xmath78 and sign @xmath79 . substituting the ratios , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , into eq.([sumrl ] ) , one finds that the amplitudes should satisfy @xmath85 this form of sum rule clearly indicates that the amplitude @xmath78 is a microscopic correction factor quantifying the collectivity of the wobbling motion , for which @xmath86 means the full - collectivity and reproduces the results of the macroscopic rotor model in both the energy and the interband @xmath83 values .",
    "since the first experimental confirmation of the wobbling excitation in @xmath14lu  @xcite , @xmath87 has been widely accepted as the shape of the tsd states in this region .",
    "this is predominantly because the calculated energy minimum for @xmath87 is deeper than that for @xmath88  @xcite according to the shape driving effect of the aligned @xmath1 quasiparticle .",
    "the recent precise measurements of @xmath63  @xcite also support this . on the other hand ,",
    "the sign of @xmath0-deformation leads different consequences on moments of inertia , which are directly connected to the excitation energy of the wobbling mode through the wobbling frequency formula  @xcite , c.f .",
    "eq.([disp ] ) .",
    "since the rpa is a microscopic formalism , no distinction between the collective rotation and the single - particle degrees of freedom has been made .",
    "therefore , the moments of inertia calculated in our rpa formalism in sect.[sectwob ] are those for rotational motions of the whole system . in contrast , the macroscopic irrotational - like moments of inertia are often used in the particle - rotor calculations , where @xmath89 for @xmath87 and they lead to an imaginary wobbling frequency @xmath55 .",
    "it is , however , noted that the moments of inertia of the particle - rotor model are those of the rotor and no effect of the single - particle alignments is included , so that they do not necessarily correspond to those calculated in our rpa formalism .    in the preceding paper  @xcite",
    "we have performed microscopic rpa calculations without dividing the system artificially into the rotor and particles .",
    "that work proved that for the calculated moment of inertia , @xmath48 , the contribution from the aligned qp(s ) , @xmath90 with @xmath91 being the aligned angular momentum , is superimposed on an irrotational - like moment of inertia ( @xmath92 ) of the  core \" .",
    "consequently the total @xmath52 is larger than @xmath93 , which makes wobbling excitation in @xmath94 nuclei possible .",
    "the second consequence of the formulation adopted in ref.@xcite is that the three moments of inertia are automatically @xmath29-dependent even when the mean - field parameters are fixed constant .",
    "this is essential in order to explain the observed @xmath29-dependence of @xmath55  _ decreasing _ as @xmath29 increases .",
    "otherwise @xmath55 is proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "another important feature of the data is that the interband @xmath83 values between the wobbling and the yrast tsd bands are surprisingly large .",
    "our rpa wave function gave extremely collective @xmath59 that gathered @xmath95 0.6  0.8 in the sum rule ( eq.([sum ] ) ) but the result accounted for only about one half of the measured one .",
    "to elucidate these findings more , in the following we extend our numerical analyses putting a special emphasis on the @xmath0-dependence of the moments of inertia in subsect.[sectlow ] .",
    "dependence on other parameters is also studied in detail .",
    "features in common and different between even - even and odd-@xmath4 nuclei are also pointed out . in subsect.[secthigh ] , we discuss @xmath29-dependence . in subsect.[sectbe2 ] , characteristics of @xmath59 are discussed .",
    "calculations are performed in five major shells ; @xmath96 3  7 for neutrons and @xmath96 2  6 for protons .",
    "the strengths @xmath97 and @xmath98 in eq.([hnil ] ) are taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "hafnium-168 is the first even - even nucleus in which tsd bands were observed  @xcite . in this nucleus",
    "three tsd bands were observed but interband @xmath0-rays connecting them have not been observed yet .",
    "this means that the character of the excited bands has not been established , although we expect at least one of them is wobbling excitation .",
    "an important feature of the data is that the average transition quadrupole moment was determined as @xmath101 eb .",
    "this imposes a moderate constraint on the shape . referring to the weak parameter dependence discussed later",
    ", we choose @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 0.3 mev , which reproduce the observed @xmath63 , as a typical mean - field parameter set .",
    "first we study the dependence of various quantities on @xmath0 and other mean - field parameters at @xmath105 0.25 mev . around this frequency the @xmath106 alignment that is essential for making wobbling excitation in @xmath94 nuclei possible is completed and therefore the wobbling motion is expected to emerge above this frequency ( see fig.[fig7 ] shown later ) .",

    "the @xmath0-reversed moment of inertia was introduced to describe positive-@xmath0 rotations in the particle - rotor model  @xcite but its physical meaning has not been very clear ; in particular , it does not fulfill the quantum - mechanical requirement that the rotations about the symmetry axis should be forbidden .",
    "we have clarified in the preceding paper  @xcite that the contributions from aligned quasiparticles superimposed on irrotational - like moments of inertia ( @xmath120 ) can realize @xmath121 and this is the very reason why the wobbling excitation ( see eq.([disp ] ) ) appears in positive-@xmath0 nuclei .",
    "we also discussed that multiple alignments could eventually lead to a rigid - body - like moment of inertia .",

    "this obviously excludes constant moments of inertia . in our calculation three moments of inertia are automatically @xmath29-dependent even when mean field parameters are fixed constant .",
    "it should be stressed that the wobbling - like solution in our rpa calculations is insensitive to the mean - field parameters , especially to the pairing gaps , as is shown in subsect.[sectlowhf ] .",
    "this distinguishes the wobbling - like solution from the usual collective vibrations , which are sensitive to the pairing correlations .",
    "thus , our microscopic rpa calculation confirms that the observed band is associated with a new type of collective excitation , although comparisons to the observed excitation energy indicate that there is room for improving the calculation .    as for the interband transition rates , our calculation accounted for only about one half or less of the measured ones , even though the wobbling - like solution is extremely collective compared to the usual vibrational modes",
