    "however , the gap between the outer and the inner bounds becomes large unboundedly as signal to noise ratio ( snr ) and interference to noise ratio ( inr ) increase .",
    "furthermore , suh and tse [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] characterized the capacity region within 2 bits / s / hz and the symmetric capacity within 1 bit / s / hz for the two - user gaussian interference channel with feedback .",
    "they also indicated that feedback provides _ multiplicative _ gain at high snr .",

    "later , the suh - tse coding scheme was extended to @xmath2-user gaussian interference channels with feedback for @xmath3 [ 7 ] .            in this paper , we propose a coding scheme which achieves better performance than the suh - tse code when @xmath0 inr@xmath1 snr is not very large ( see figs.1 - 2 of this paper ) .",
    "in addition , our code can attain better symmetric rate than the kramer code for all channel parameters , and therefore it overcomes all the weak - points of the suh - tse coding scheme and improves the suh - tse and kramer inner bounds .",
    "for the strong interference case , our code can achieve the same generalized degrees - of - freedom as the suh - tse coding scheme .",
    "furthermore , numerical results show that our coding scheme indeed has better / equal performance than / to the suh - tse coding scheme for all channel parameters .",
