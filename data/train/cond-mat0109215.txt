    "granular media in rapid , dilute flow exhibit a surprising similarity to ordinary fluids and the utility of a hydrodynamic description for such conditions has been recognized for many years @xcite .",
    "this phenomenology has come under scrutiny in recent years with questions about the domain of its validity and the associated constitutive equations appearing in the hydrodynamic equations @xcite .",
    "answers to such questions can be found in a more fundamental microscopic description where the tools of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics are available for critical analysis .",
    "an intermediate mesoscopic description between statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics is that of kinetic theory , whose applicability to granular matter also poses questions .",
    "the objective in this short communication is to provide an example of a precise context in which the relevance of kinetic and hydrodynamic descriptions can be assessed .",
    "a more general review of the current status for this problem with extensive references was prepared for this workshop @xcite and should be consulted for completeness .    the system considered is a one component gas of @xmath0 smooth hard spheres at low density .",
    "the inelastic collisions are characterized by a normal restitution coefficient @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the elastic limit .",
    "the state of the system at each time is specified by a point in the @xmath3 dimensional phase space and the dynamics is given by uniform motion and binary inelastic velocity changes at contact .",
    "these are the necessary ingredients to construct a statistical mechanics for this idealized model of granular media .",
    "it is straightforward to write the liouville equation for the probability density and from it obtain the bbgky hierarchy for the reduced distribution functions brey97statmech , dufty00granada , ernst00rev , vannoije01sm . in the next section the condition of low density",
    "is exploited to obtain a complete , closed kinetic theory description for the gas from the bbgky hierarchy .",
    "the low density expansion leading to this result is formally the same as that for a gas with elastic collisions .",
    "consequently , it would appear that the kinetic description for the granular gas has the same level of validity as that for normal gases .",
    "the derivation of hydrodynamics from the kinetic theory is discussed in the third section .",
    "hydrodynamics is defined generally as the composition of exact balance equations for the density , energy density ( or granular temperature ) , and the momentum density ( or flow field ) plus constitutive equations for the associated fluxes and cooling rate .",
    "constitutive equations exist whenever there is a ",
    "solution to the kinetic theory .",
    "such a solution can be constructed explicitly for weakly inhomogeneous states , leading to a navier - stokes hydrodynamics for the granular gas brey98boltz , garzo00enskog , garzo01mix .",
    "the need to go beyond the navier - stokes approximation is rare for normal gases , but is not uncommon for many relevant granular gas states .",
    "it remains a challenge for granular gas theory to understand the form of constitutive equations for these more general conditions , but this uncertainty should not be interpreted as a signature of the failure for hydrodynamics to apply .",
    "concerns about a kinetic theory description for granular gases are often based on a too restrictive concept of the prerequisites ( e.g. , the existence of an equilibrium state ) .",
    "it is useful therefore to provide a formal  derivation  of the kinetic description at low density to demonstate the close similarity between normal and granular gases , without unwarranted conceptual prejudices . in this section a small parameter expansion of the reduced distribution functions",
    "is shown to provide a formal solution to the entire bbgky  hierarchy , in parallel to the corresponding analysis for normal gases @xcite .",
    "the analysis is similar to an expansion proposed by grad for the hard sphere gas with elastic collisions @xcite . in this approach",
    ", there is no reference to concepts such as  approach to equilibrium  , maxwellian distribution , or",
    " molecular chaos  , and the distinction between inelastic or elastic collisions plays no explicit role .",
    "thus , superficially at least , it appears the basis for the low density kinetic theory is the same in both cases .    the s - particle reduced distribution functions , @xmath4 , obey the bbgky hierarchy where @xmath5 .",
    "a dimensionless form of this hierarchy is obtained by scaling the space and time with the mean free path @xmath6 and the mean free time @xmath7 . here",
    ", @xmath8 is the density , @xmath9 is the hard sphere diameter , and @xmath10 is some characteristic velocity .",
    "similarly , the reduced distribution functions are scaled with @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting dimensionless bbgky hierarchy has the form @xmath12the binary scattering operator @xmath13 for a pair of particles @xmath14 is defined by@xmath15 , \\label{2.2}\\]]where @xmath16 is a unit vector along @xmath17 and @xmath18 denotes a two dimensional solid angle integration over the sphere for particles at contact . also , @xmath19 is the relative velocity , and @xmath20 is the scattering operator defined for any function @xmath21 by @xmath22 the  restituting  velocities are@xmath23the @xmath24 dependence  of @xmath13 contains all aspects of the inelasticity , and plays no explicit role in the following expansion .    in this dimensionless",
    "form the bbgky  hierarchy depends on the single dimensionless parameter @xmath25 , the ratio of the  force range  to the mean free path .",
    "this parameter is small at low density , suggesting an expansion for a solution to the entire hierarchy as a power series in @xmath26 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath26 occurs explicitly as shown on the left side of ( [ 2.1 ] ) and implicitly through the finite separation of the colliding particles in @xmath27 .",
    "the structural features of the expansion in @xmath26 are simplest if it is performed at fixed @xmath13 .",
    "the s - particle reduced distribution functions are taken to have the representation @xmath28it is then readily shown that the hierarchy is solved exactly to order @xmath29 in the form @xmath30@xmath31where the expression for @xmath32 holds for @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the reduced distribution functions for any number of particles are determined as a sum of products of the single particle functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and pair function @xmath36 .",
    "these are determined from the set of three fundamental kinetic equations @xmath37@xmath38@xmath39here @xmath40 is the boltzmann - bogoliubov collision operator and @xmath41 , defined over functions of @xmath42 , is its linearized form @xmath43@xmath44    these low density results ( [ 2.8])-([2.10 ] ) provide the kinetic theory description for the gas .",
    "they are remarkably rich . as expected , the leading order distribution function @xmath45 is the solution to the boltzmann equation .",
    "the two particle correlations are generated from the uncorrelated product of boltzmann solutions through inelastic binary collisions @xmath46 on the right side of ( [ 2.9 ] ) .",
    "finally , corrections to the boltzmann solution due to correlations are given by a coupling of the distribution function to the correlations in ( [ 2.10 ] ) ( the so - called  ring  recollision effects ) .",
    "the solutions and implications of these kinetic equations can be quite different for elastic and inelastic collisions .",
    "but these differences come from the equations themselves and should not be interpreted as signatures of their failure to apply .",
    "for example , at @xmath47 a possible solution for an isolated system is @xmath48 , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "equation  ( [ 2.10 ] ) supports @xmath51 because energy is conserved , and @xmath52 because @xmath53 for the same reason .",
    "since energy conservation no longer holds with @xmath54 it is not surprising that the isolated system does not approach equilibrium , the maxwellian is not a stationary solution , and that finite correlations exist .",
    "indeed , the extent to which such predicted differences agree with observations from molecular dynamics provide _ support _ for the kinetic theory , not _ limitations _ on it as is sometimes implied .    clearly , the above derivation has not restricted this kinetic description to isolated systems or near - equilibrium states .",
    "in fact , the most interesting cases of practical interest are response to boundary conditions and/or external fields .",
    "the similarities between normal and granular fluids is closest for such  nonequilibrium",
    " conditions . too often , properties of granular gases are contrasted only to those of the equilibrium state for normal gases .",
    "it is important to note that practical access to the solutions to the above kinetic equations is possible for a wide range of conditions by direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) @xcite .",
    "much attention has been given to the special ",
    "homogeneous cooling state ",
    "( hcs ) which is a solution to the boltzmann equation with the scaling form@xmath55the form of this is hcs distribution is known to good approximation by analytic methods , which have been confirmed by dsmc @xcite .",
    "the correlations for this state also have been studied in some detail @xcite by both analytic and simulation methods . finally ,",
    "studies of more complex states ( e.g. , shear flow ) also have been given @xcite .",
    "in summary , the kinetic theory description appears to describe well a wealth of new phenomena peculiar to inelastic collisions .",
    "consider now a spatially inhomogeneous state , created either by initial preparation or by boundary conditions .",
    "the local balance equations for the density @xmath56 , granular temperature @xmath57 ( or energy density ) , and flow velocity @xmath58 follow directly by taking moments of the boltzmann equation ( [ 2.8 ] ) with respect to @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xmath62@xmath63@xmath64here @xmath65 is the material derivative , @xmath66 is the pressure tensor and @xmath67 is the heat flux .",
    "the form of these balance equations is the same as for fluids with elastic collisions except for the source term on the on the right side of ( [ 3.2 ] ) due to the dissipative collisions , where @xmath68 is identified as the cooling rate .",
    "the fluxes @xmath69 , @xmath70  and the cooling rate @xmath71 are given as explicit low degree moments of the distribution function @xmath72 @xmath73@xmath74    the utility of these balance equations is limited without further specification of @xmath75 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 which , in general , have a complex space and time  dependence .",
    "however , for a fluid with elastic collisions this dependence  simplifies  on sufficiently large space and time scales where it is given entirely through a functional dependence on the fields @xmath8 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting functional dependencies of @xmath75 and @xmath70 on these fields are called constitutive equations and their discovery can be a difficult many - body problem .",
    "the above balance equations , together with the constitutive equations , become  a closed set of equations for @xmath8 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 called _",
    "hydrodynamic equations_. this is the most general and abstract notion of hydrodynamics , which encompasses both the navier - stokes form for small spatial gradients and more general forms for nonlinear rheological transport .",
    "the primary feature of a hydrodynamic description is the reduction of the description from many microscopic degrees of freedom to a set of equations for only five local fields .",
    "the critical problem for a hydrodynamic description is therefore to determine the existence and form of the constitutive equations .",
    "it is clear from ( [ 3.3 ] ) and ( [ 3.4 ] ) that they can be obtained if the boltzmann equation admits a ",
    "solution , whose space and time dependence occurs entirely through its functional dependence on the fields @xmath78the fluxes and cooling rate then inherit this space and time dependence and become constitutive equations .",
    "the space and time dependence of the fields follows from solution to the resulting hydrodynamic equations to complete the self - consistent description of @xmath79 .",
    "an example is given by the hcs distribution in ( [ 2.12 ] ) where there is no space dependence and all of the time dependence occurs through @xmath80 . the latter is determined from the hydrodynamic equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) , which reduces to @xmath81 @xmath82 .",
    "use of ( [ 2.12 ] ) in ( [ 3.5 ] ) gives the constitutive equation @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a constant .    for gases with elastic collisions the prototypical hydrodynamics",
    "is that of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the corresponding constitutive equations , newton s viscosity law and fourier s heat law , follow from a normal solution to the boltzmann equation obtained from an expansion in the spatial gradients .",
    "the reference state is the _ local _ maxwellian whose parameters are the exact density , temperature , and flow velocity for the nonequilibrium state being described .",
    "deviations from this reference state are proportional to the spatial gradients of the temperature and flow field .",
    "the systematic expansion for the normal solution to the boltzmann equation is generated by the chapman - enskog method .",
    "there have been three main objections / reservations / concerns regarding application of this method for granular gases : 1 ) the absence of an equilibrium state as the basis for the local maxwellian reference state , 2 ) the inherent time dependence of any reference state due to collisional cooling , and 3 ) the inclusion of the energy ( temperature ) as a hydrodynamic field when it is not associated with a conserved density and does not have a time scale solely characterized by the degree of spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "the first two concerns are primarily technical rather than conceptual issues that can be answered by direct application of the chapman - enskog method to see if it indeed generates a normal solution to the granular boltzmann equation . consider a state for which the spatial variations of @xmath8 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are small on the scale of the mean free path , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the mean free path .",
    "then it is expected that the functional dependence of the normal solution on the hydrodynamic fields can be made local in space  through a taylor series expansion about a point @xmath87 for which the distribution function is being evaluated .",
    "let @xmath88 denote a formal small  uniformity  parameter measuring the small spatial gradients in the fields .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that there is no restriction on the cooling rate @xmath71 ; only the spatial gradients are being ordered by the uniformity parameter .",
    "the distribution function , collision operator , and time derivatives are given by the representations @xmath89the coefficients in the time derivative expansion are identified from the balance equations with a similar expansion for @xmath75 , @xmath70 , and @xmath90 generated through their definitions ( [ 3.4 ] ) and ( [ 3.5 ] ) as functionals of @xmath79 . as for elastic collisions",
    "the leading term @xmath91 is further constrained to have the same moments with respect to @xmath92 and @xmath93 as the full distribution @xmath79 .",
    "this assures that the hydrodynamic fields occuring in @xmath91 are exactly those for the nonequilibrium state , and hence @xmath91 is normal . to zeroth order in @xmath88",
    "the boltzmann kinetic equation becomes @xmath94 .",
    "\\label{3.8}\\]]where @xmath95 .    the first concern above regarding the reference distribution now",
    "can be addressed .",
    "the distribution @xmath91 is not free to be chosen , but rather is determined by the kinetic equation itself . for the granular gas",
    "it is _ not _ the local maxwellian , but rather the local ( normal ) hcs solution ( i.e. , ( [ 2.12 ] ) with the density , temperature , and flow field replaced by their nonequlibrium values ) .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ requirement of an equilibrium state for the chapman - enskog method to apply , and in fact early applications based on a local equilibrium state are inconsistent and lead to incorrect transport coefficients even for weak dissipation .",
    "the concept of `` approach to equilibrium '' is no longer relevant for granular gases .",
    "mathematically , the changes in this method for granular gases arise from the fact that the time derivative of the temperature does not vanish to lowest order in @xmath88 , as it does for a gas with elastic collisions .",
    "the reference state @xmath91 incorporates this zeroth order time dependence of the temperature even for strong dissipation .",
    "this is the origin of the second concern noted above .",
    "however , since @xmath91 is normal , it necessarily has the exact time dependence of all hydrodynamic fields .",
    "the only difference for granular gases is the introduction of a new time scale @xmath96 in the reference state .",
    "there is nothing _ a priori _ inconsistent with a description of slow spatial decay towards a time dependent reference state .",
    "in fact , this is an important feature of the chapman - enskog scheme for both granular and normal fluids alike - use of a time independent reference state would limit the derivation to only _ linear _ hydrodynamics .",
    "implementation of the chapman - enskog method to the first order in @xmath88 is now straightforward and has been carried out in detail and without approximation recently for the boltzmann equation @xcite ( and for its dense fluid generalization , the enskog equation @xcite ) ; the case of a two component mixture is considered in @xcite .",
    "the constitutive equations for the one component fluid found to this order are@xmath97@xmath98the form of the pressure tensor is the same as that for fluids with elastic collisions , where @xmath99 is the shear viscosity depending on the restitution coefficient .",
    "the heat flux is similar to fourier s law , where @xmath100 is the thermal conductivity .",
    "there is a new transport coefficient @xmath101 coupling the heat flux to a density gradient , which vanishes at @xmath2 .",
    "the transport coefficients are given in terms of solutions to inhomogeneous integral equations involving the linearized boltzmann collision operator .",
    "solubility conditions for the existence of solutions have been proven and approximate solutions in terms of polynomial expansions have been obtained for practical purposes , just as for the case of elastic collisions @xcite .",
    "consequently , the transport coefficients are known as explicit functions of @xmath102 .",
    "the chapman - enskog method places no explicit restriction on @xmath24 so the results are not limited to weak dissipation .",
    "it remains to discuss the third concern , use of the temperature as a hydrodynamic field which is no longer associated with a conserved density .",
    "analysis of the navier - stokes approximation described above shows there are two classes of inherent time scales to this hydrodynammic description .",
    "the first scales with the wavelength of the phenomena considered and can be made large ( long time scales ) by considering sufficiently smooth disturbances .",
    "this is the case for gases with elastic collisions . for granular gases",
    "there is a second time scale in the temperature equation , the inverse cooling rate , which is bounded for a given value of the restitution coefficient .",
    "the concern is that this new time scale may be shorter than that required for validity of the normal solution to the kinetic equation .",
    "qualitatively , a wide class of solutions for spatially inhomogeneous states evolves in two stages . during a short transient period of the order of the mean free time ( the kinetic stage ) ,",
    "the velocity distribution approaches closely the local distribution @xmath91 and becomes normal as in ( [ 3.6 ] ) .",
    "subsequently , on a longer time scale the space and time dependence of the distribution occurs only through the fields that are governed by hydrodynamic equations .",
    "this notion of a two stage relaxation is similar to that for gases with elastic collisions and is confirmed for granular gases by dsmc . the question , therefore , is whether the inverse cooling rate is smaller than the mean free time .",
    "certainly , this is the case for weak dissipation since @xmath103 is proportional to @xmath104 . for strong dissipation",
    "it is necessary to study in detail the spectrum of non hydrodynamic ( kinetic ) modes to find the slowest mode and compare it with the inverse cooling rate .",
    "this has been done for the diverse examples of brownian motion , kinetic models , and uniform shear flow ( see @xcite ) . in all cases",
    "it is found that there is a separation of time scales between the slowest kinetic mode and the inverse cooling rate , even at strong dissipation .",
    "based on these examples , it appears that inclusion of the temperature in the hydrodynamic description is justified for a wide range of degrees of dissipation .",
    "the validity of navier - stokes hydrodynamics and the dependence of the transport coefficients on the restitution coefficient has been verified in a number of simulations , both dsmc and md , giving excellent agreement with the predictions from the chapman - enskog method . the tests at low density based on the boltzmann equation have been reviewed recently by brey and cubero brey01rev .",
    "the navier - stokes equations equations associated with ( [ 3.9 ] ) and ( [ 3.10 ] ) are also known as newtonian hydrodynamics .",
    "although the chapman - enskog method can be carried out to second order in @xmath88 ( burnett order ) , it is likely that failure of the navier - stokes approximation signals more complex non newtonian behavior for which other methods to construct the normal solution are required that are not based on a small gradient expansion .",
    "two questions have been addressed here : 1 ) can kinetic theory provide a valid mesoscopic description of rapid flow ( fluidized ) granular media ? , and 2 ) can a hydrodynamic description be formulated and justified for a macroscopic description ?",
    "the origin of the kinetic description for a low density gas has been shown to follow from an expansion that makes no reference as to whether the collisions are elastic or inelastic .",
    "the latter affects only the solution to these equations .",
    "it appears that many of the questions , concerns , and objections raised regarding the validity of a kinetic theory description are removed in this way .",
    "furthermore , kinetic theory provides a powerful tool for analysis and predictions of rapid flow gas dynamics when combined with the method of dsmc for numerical solution .",
    "its full potential for both conceptual and practical questions has not yet been exploited .",
    "an important use of the kinetic theory is to determine if a hydrodynamic description applies and to define its domain of validity .",
    "equations ( [ 2.7 ] ) - ( [ 2.9 ] ) leave no room for speculation . for given initial and boundary conditions",
    "the solution either approaches a normal form on some space and time scale or it does not .",
    "the issue of a hydrodynamic description is now a precise mathematical question .",
    "this is particularly important if the hydrodynamic description is more complex than that of navier - stokes .",
    "non newtonian hydrodynamics is rare or unphysical for simple atomic systems with elastic collisions .",
    "in contrast , they it is more common for granular gases in steady states where the gradients are strongly correlated to the coefficient of restitution . kinetic theory is perhaps the only systematic means to determine the constitutive equations in these cases .",
    "it is clear from recent studies that granular media exhibit a wide range of interesting phenomena for which a navier - stokes hydrodynamics is an accurate and practical tool ( see @xcite for specific examples and references ) .",
    "although the context here has been limited to low density gases a similar kinetic theory basis has been developed for navier - stokes hydrodynamics in moderately dense fluids garzo00enskog .",
    "more generally , non newtonian behavior puts granular fluids in a class of complex materials with mysterious , as yet unexplained , properties @xcite . kinetic theory and hydrodynamics ( in the broader sense )",
    "can be expected to provide much of this explanation .",
