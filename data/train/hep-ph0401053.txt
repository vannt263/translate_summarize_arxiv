    "high - energy diffractive photo- and electroproductions of charmonia off a nucleon , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , are of particular interest , since they open a new window on the interface between perturbative and nonperturbative aspects in qcd @xcite . with perturbative qcd ( pqcd )",
    ", it has been shown @xcite that the cross sections of these processes depend quadratically on the relevant hadronic matrix elements , i.e. , the wave function ( wf ) of a charmonium ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) and the gluon distribution inside the target nucleon .",
    "thus , the diffractive charmonium productions are expected to be sensitive to those nonperturbative matrix elements , especially the behavior of the gluon distribution for small bjorken-@xmath11 .",
    "recent data from the @xmath12 collider hera @xcite will indeed provide us with quantitative information on them , while the precision of the data calls for qcd analysis taking into account also the subleading effects .",
    "for high @xmath13-@xmath14 center - of - mass energy @xmath15 , the corresponding diffractive amplitude obeys factorization and , in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) of pqcd , is expressed schematically as ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram0 ] ) @xmath16 with the photon light - cone wf @xmath17 for the @xmath18 transition , the amplitude @xmath19 for the elastic scattering of the @xmath6-pair off the nucleon by exchanging reggeized two gluons , and the vector - meson wf @xmath20 for the soft hadronization process @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath19 is further factorized into the @xmath6-gluon hard scattering amplitude @xmath22 and the gluon distribution @xmath23 inside the nucleon , @xmath24 physically , the factorization of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : a ] ) and ( [ eqn : a2 ] ) follows from the property that the typical timescale of the @xmath6-@xmath14 scattering at high @xmath15 is much shorter than the lifetime of the @xmath6 fluctuation , as well as of the fluctuation of partons inside the nucleon @xcite",
    ". moreover , the heavy - quark mass @xmath25 ensures that the @xmath18 fluctuation is sufficiently a short - distance process that takes place within a distance of order @xmath26 or less .",
    "this enables us to treat the photon wf @xmath17 , as well as the scattering amplitude @xmath22 between the small - size @xmath6-color - dipole and the gluon , by perturbation theory even for the photoproduction with the photon s virtuality @xmath27 .",
    "( [ eqn : a ] ) involves the convolution with the @xmath6-bound - state wf @xmath20 . here , the large mass of @xmath25 also allows us to organize the amplitude @xmath28 into a hierarchy in terms of the dependence on the average velocity @xmath29 of the heavy quark in the charmonium rest frame .",
    "the leading term independent of @xmath29 corresponds to the static or nonrelativistic limit , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 have no relative motion inside the charmonium , while the subleading terms in powers of @xmath29 express the fermi motion corrections and relativistic corrections . for the charmonium ,",
    "quark potential model calculations @xcite as well as lattice qcd simulations @xcite indicate that @xmath29 is reasonably small , @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the subleading terms are not expected to produce so large corrections , though they could be physically important .",
    "so far , there exist several investigations for the fermi motion corrections , but significant discrepancies are observed among the previous results : frankfurt - koepf - strikman ( fks ) @xcite predicted quite strong suppression of the cross section for the diffractive photo- ( electro-)production of @xmath0 by a factor @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) due to the fermi motion effects .",
    "on the other hand , the results of ryskin - roberts - martin - levin ( rrml ) @xcite gave a significantly weaker suppression factor of @xmath33 for the @xmath0 photoproduction .",
    "furthermore , the author of ref .",
    "@xcite estimated an even weaker suppression factor of 0.9 or more for the @xmath0 electroproduction .",
    "the treatment of these three works is different in several points ; in particular , the difference in the detailed shape of the meson wf @xmath20 appears to be an important source of the discrepancies , as claimed by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite . in our opinion , however , any of those works is not satisfactory as the calculations of the fermi motion effects , because certain effects due to the relative motion of the quarks are not taken into account .",
    "the aim of this paper is to reexamine the fermi motion corrections on the diffractive photo- and electroproductions of charmonia .",
    "similarly to the previous works @xcite , our basic formulation relies on the qcd factorization approach in the lla of pqcd . in this framework , we re - derive the formulae ( [ eqn : a ] ) , ( [ eqn : a2 ] ) explicitly , paying attention to the contributions that are related to the relative motion of the quarks and thus should be regarded as a part of the fermi motion effects .",
    "we find three types of such additional contributions , which have not been considered properly in a single treatment so far .",
    "first of all , from the viewpoint of the systematic expansion of the total amplitude ( [ eqn : a ] ) in terms of the velocity @xmath29 , the fermi motion corrections through the relative order @xmath34 should be computed with the bethe - salpeter @xmath6 wf @xmath20 , which is defined as the matrix element of a bilocal operator composed of the two - component pauli spinor fields for @xmath3 and @xmath4 in a nonrelativistic schrdinger field theory , replacing the original relativistic field theory .",
    "namely , when the wf @xmath20 is expressed in the usual four - component dirac representation , it is subject to a constraint @xmath35 with the projector @xmath36 onto the `` large components '' corresponding to the pauli spinor .",
    "physically , this implies that the wf @xmath20 describes a pure @xmath5 @xmath6-state .",
    "rrml did not consider the role of such projector @xmath36 at all @xcite .",
    "in fks @xcite , an improper projector @xmath36 was used , which was constructed in an oversimplified fashion .",
    "we employ the projector @xmath36 , which obeys spin - symmetry in the schrdinger field theory and coincides with that appeared in ref .",
    "we will show that the spin structure of @xmath20 , which is imposed by our @xmath36 , modifies the amplitude ( [ eqn : a ] ) at the order @xmath34 in comparison with rrml or fks .",
    "following the previous works @xcite , when combining the factors of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : a ] ) , we express the meson wf @xmath20 , as well as the other parts @xmath19 and @xmath17 , in a helicity representation .",
    "this corresponds to a familiar representation of the qcd factorization formulae in the lepage - brodsky approach for hard exclusive processes @xcite .",
    "the helicity representation of @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : a ] ) is given by the matrix element @xmath38 , in terms of helicity dirac spinors @xmath39 and @xmath40 for quark and antiquark .",
    "this spinor matrix element representing the effective `` @xmath21 vertex '' may be off the energy shell : the total energy carried by the two spinors @xmath41 and @xmath39 is generally different from the energy of the vector meson . in the previous works @xcite , however , the on - shellness was assumed when evaluating the matrix element for the effective @xmath21 vertex .",
    "apparently , this assumption corresponds to neglecting the binding energy of the charmonium , so that it could give the @xmath42 error in the final result .",
    "thus , the second of the additional fermi motion contribution is generated by the off - shellness of the @xmath21 vertex .",
    "third , the feynman diagrams relevant for the lla of the factorization formula ( [ eqn : a2 ] ) tell us that the gluon s momentum fraction inside the nucleon , which is probed by the diffractive production , depends on the longitudinal as well as transverse relative motion of @xmath3 and @xmath4 through the momentum exchange at the quark - gluon coupling .",
    "namely , the bjorken-@xmath11 of the distribution @xmath23 of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : a2 ] ) depends on the motion of the quarks , which produces the @xmath42 effects to the amplitude ( [ eqn : a ] ) , though the previous works @xcite seem to have simply neglected this contribution .",
    "as we will demonstrate , the modification of the amplitude ( [ eqn : a ] ) due to the above three types of contributions is sensitive to the transverse relative motion of the quarks inside charmonia ; i.e. , the transverse quark motion is no less important than the longitudinal one for the production of nonrelativistic bound - state with @xmath43 .",
    "this is in contrast with the light - cone dominated processes such as the hard diffractive productions of the @xmath44 meson ( @xmath45 ) , where the longitudinal quark motion plays a dominant role compared with the transverse one , and the effects of the transverse quark motion give only small corrections of higher twist @xmath46 @xcite .    by including those three types of additional contributions",
    ", we will give quantitative estimates of the fermi motion effects .",
    "we employ the `` shape '' of the meson wf @xmath20 , which is obtained by solving the schrdinger equation with a realistic potential between the quark and the antiquark .",
    "we compute the cross sections for the diffractive photo- and electroproductions of @xmath0 , and find that the fermi motion effects give moderate suppression .",
    "the net effect of our fermi motion contributions is , roughly speaking , similar to that of rrml @xcite , but our results show some new features in comparison with those of rrml as well as of refs . @xcite . to demonstrate them",
    ", we calculate the ratio of the cross sections with longitudinally and transversely polarized photons , @xmath47 .",
    "because the contribution of the gluon distribution @xmath23 proves to mostly cancel in this ratio , this quantity is sensitive to the first two of the above - mentioned additional fermi motion effects , which are strongly helicity - dependent .",
    "another interesting quantity is the ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath0 cross sections , by extending our calculation to the case of a radial excitation @xmath1 .",
    "we observe that the fermi motion effects produce characteristic behavior for the ratio , reflecting the different shape of the wfs of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the formulae ( [ eqn : a ] ) and ( [ eqn : a2 ] ) in the lla with our additional fermi motion effects . after recalling the basic steps to derive the factorization formula for the diffractive production ,",

    "iv , a summary and discussion are presented .",
    "let us first describe a basic formulation to evaluate the diffractive photo- or electroproduction of the heavy quarkonium .",
    "we consider the forward diffractive production of the heavy vector - meson , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the four momenta of the photon and the incoming nucleon , respectively , and @xmath54 the momentum transfer in the @xmath55-channel .",
    "the total center - of - mass energy of the @xmath13-@xmath14 system , @xmath56 , is assumed to be much larger than the photon s virtuality and the heavy - quark mass , @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "we also suppose @xmath59 with @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . under such kinematical condition ,",
    "the relevant diagrams for the scattering amplitude in the lla are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "the heavy - quark mass @xmath25 allows us to calculate the creation of the @xmath6 pair , @xmath62 , as well as its time development by perturbation theory before the nonperturbative effects to form the quarkonium state @xmath63 set in .",
    "as is well - known , the corresponding amplitude is dominated by its imaginary part , which we shall calculate explicitly ; the contributions from the real part can be incorporated perturbatively . for simplicity , we consider the forward limit of the diffractive process , @xmath64 , in detail .    to proceed , we introduce two null vectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the nucleon mass , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . in the forward limit @xmath73",
    ", we also have @xmath74 with @xmath75 the mass of the heavy vector - meson , so that @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in fig .",

    "we choose a lorentz frame as @xmath83 and @xmath84 , so that @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and similarly for @xmath79 .    in the calculation of the discontinuity of the relevant diagrams , the on - shell conditions for the quark lines , which cross the `` cut '' as shown in fig .",

    "now , formally , the factorization formula follows from the observation that the dominant integration region in the @xmath90-variable is the one of @xmath92 for fixed @xmath91 in the high - energy limit ( [ eq : he ] ) , and , in this regime @xmath93 , the exchanged soft gluons couple to the quarks with an eikonal vertex @xmath94 corresponding to a single gluon polarization .",
    "the use of the eikonal vertex immediately leads to the factorization of the photon wf @xmath17 and the vector - meson wf @xmath20 from @xmath95 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : a ] ) ) .",

    "we have presented a quantitative estimate of the fermi motion effects on the diffractive production cross sections , including our three new contributions . in the qcd factorization formula for the diffractive charmonium production ,",
    "the nonperturbative , internal motion of quarks is represented by the light - cone wfs for the charmonium , which we have constructed from the corresponding @xmath155-wave solution of the schrdinger equation with a realistic potential between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we find that the net effect from the fermi motion gives moderate suppression of the total cross section for the @xmath0 photo- and electroproductions .",
    "the corresponding suppression is similar to that obtained by rrml @xcite for the @xmath0 photoproduction , but it is much weaker than that observed by fks @xcite for the photoproduction as well as the electroproduction . we have also clarified the strong helicity - dependence of our new fermi motion effects , and predicted novel behavior in the helicity - dependent cross sections : the slope of the longitudinal to transverse production ratio @xmath47 as a function of @xmath242 distinguishes clearly our result from the results corresponding to the previous works . because the @xmath47 ratio is expected to be insensitive to elaborate corrections or theoretical uncertainties , we propose it as a clean discriminator among the various predictions of the fermi motion effects . for the detailed comparison of the @xmath47 ratio between theory and experiment , we should wait for the new precise data , especially for the high @xmath263 region .",
    "we have also observed the similar behavior for the @xmath1 photo- and electroproductions .",
    "our results for the ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath0 cross sections indicate that the suppression of the cross section becomes somewhat stronger for the @xmath1 production than for the @xmath0 one , reflecting rapider motion of quarks inside the first radial excitation .",
    "we have demonstrated that the @xmath1 to @xmath0 ratio is also useful in discriminating the various theoretical calculations of the fermi motion effects .",
    "another interesting point is that the @xmath242 dependence of the @xmath1 to @xmath0 ratio is sensitive to the detailed shape of the wfs of the @xmath1 as well as of the @xmath0 , while it is insensitive to the behavior of the gluon distribution .    as a novel feature in the heavy meson production ,",
    "we have emphasized that the fermi motion in the transverse direction is as important as that in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the transverse quark motion plays a major role to produce characteristic effects due to the fermi motion , especially the strongly helicity - dependent effects .",
    "the comparison of our results with the hera data has been made in this paper .",
    "taking into account the theoretical ambiguity associated with the lla , we may conclude that our full results involving the new fermi motion effects are in agreement with the recent data .",
    "however , it should be taken with reservation , because , in this work , we have not pursued some corrections , which could in principle produce the effects of the same order as the fermi motion corrections .",
    "those include genuine relativistic corrections due to the `` small components '' of the meson wf @xmath20 , and the next - to - leading perturbative corrections to the photon wf @xmath17 and the @xmath6-gluon hard scattering amplitude @xmath22 ( see eqs .",

    ", the comparison has shown that our results reproduce the overall behavior of the data as functions of @xmath263 as well as the energy @xmath15 , over a range of observables .",
    "therefore , what we can learn from this study is that the fermi motion effects provide natural mechanisms within the lla , which give the characteristic behavior of the total cross sections as well as of the helicity - dependent cross sections observed in experiment . for the more detailed quantitative comparison with the data",
    ", one would eventually have to take into account further sophisticated corrections besides above - mentioned ones : those include , e.g. , the contribution of higher fock states such as @xmath332 in the charmonia , the `` skewedness '' of the gluon distribution @xcite , and the @xmath15-dependence of the @xmath55-slope parameter @xmath333 for the differential cross section @xmath334 @xcite .",
