    "a well - known surface model is the one of helfrich , polyakov and kleinert ( hpk ) @xcite .",
    "the phase structure of hpk model is connected to string models and membranes @xcite and therefore has long been investigated theoretically @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "membranes are considered to be two - dimensional surfaces in the conventional hpk model , and hence homogeneity is assumed in the model .",
    "however , membranes are not always homogeneous ; cell membranes are known to be supported by skeletons .",
    "hop diffusion of membrane proteins or lipids was experimentally observed recently @xcite .",
    "the free diffusion of molecules is prohibited , and the diffusion is localized in some domains on the cell membranes . the origin of this is considered to be due to the cytoskeletons .",
    "artificial membranes are considered to have skeletons because they are partly polymerized @xcite .",
    "the phase structure of skeleton models should therefore be studied as a statistical mechanical problem .",
    "skeleton models for the cytoskeleton were already investigated in @xcite . a hard - wall and hard - core potential was assumed on the polymer chains with junctions , and the responses to some external stress and the compression modulus were obtained @xcite .",
    "giant fluid vesicles coated with skeletons was experimentally investigated , and the mechanical properties were reported @xcite , where the actin filaments introduce an inhomogeneous structure in homogeneous artificial membranes . a compartmentalized surface model was reported to undergo a first - order transition @xcite , where the compartment boundary prevents the vertices from the free diffusion . in @xcite , the phase structure of a surface model with skeleton was investigated , and it was reported that the model has a first - order transition between the smooth phase and the crumpled phase .",
    "the interaction of the model in @xcite is described by one - dimensional bending energy for linear chains ( or bonds ) and two - dimensional bending energy for junctions .",
    "the two - dimensional gaussian bond potential is also assumed in the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the interaction of the model in @xcite seems a little bit more complicated than that of hpk model .",
    "one of the reasons of this is because the two - dimensional elasticity is assumed at the junctions .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to see whether the transition of @xcite occurs in more simplified skeleton models .",
    "one possible model is obtained from the model of @xcite by replacing the elastic junction with a rigid junction .    in this letter",
    ", we study the rigid junction model by using the canonical monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and see how the transition of @xcite occurs in such a simplified model .",
    "we must note that the rigid junction model is not included in the elastic junction models .",
    "in fact , there are two types of elasticity at the elastic junctions ; one is the out - of - plane elasticity and the other is the in - plane elasticity .",
    "the former elasticity can be rigid in the elastic junction model of @xcite in the limit of infinite bending rigidity @xmath0 , however , the latter one can not be controlled in the elastic junction model .",
    "therefore , the rigid junction model in this letter and the elastic junction model in @xcite are considered to be two different models .",
    "the model is defined on the triangulated surfaces , which are characterized by @xmath1 the total number of vertices including the junctions , @xmath2 the total number of vertices on the chains , @xmath3 the total number of junctions , and @xmath4 the length of chains between junctions .",
    "the junctions are assumed as rigid plates ; twelve of them are pentagon and the others are hexagon .",
    "it should be noted again that @xmath3 is included in @xmath1 ; a junction is counted as a vertex .",
    "figures [ fig-1](a ) and [ fig-1](b ) show surfaces of size @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "thick lines denote the chains terminated at the junctions , and the chains together with junctions form the compartment boundary .",
    "all the vertices can fluctuate only locally on the chains as well as inside the compartments , and they are prohibited from the diffusion because of the fixed connectivity nature of the lattice .    0.1 in    ( 0,0 ) ( 10,10 ) ( 18,8.5)(0,0)(a ) @xmath7 ( 39,8.5)(0,0)(b ) @xmath8     and ( b ) @xmath6 , where @xmath1 is the total number of vertices including the total number of junctions , @xmath2 is the total number of vertices on the chains , @xmath3 is the total number of junctions , and @xmath4 is the length of chains between junctions .",
    "thick lines denote the chains , which terminate at the junctions .",
    ", width=396 ]    the lattice of @xmath5 in fig.[fig-1](a ) corresponds to that of @xmath9 in fig.[fig-1](a ) of @xcite .",
    "the reason why @xmath10 of the surface in fig.[fig-1](a ) is smaller than @xmath11 of the one in @xcite is because the junctions are rigid objects in this letter while they are elastic ones in @xcite .",
    "one hexagonal junction reduces @xmath1 by @xmath12 , and one pentagonal junction also reduces @xmath1 by @xmath13 if they were assumed as rigid objects .",
    "thus , we can check that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the total number of pentagonal junction and that of hexagonal junctions , respectively .",
    "the triangulated surfaces such as the ones shown in figs . [ fig-1](a ) and [ fig-1](b ) are constructed as follows : firstly , we process the icosahedron by dividing every edge into @xmath17-pieces of uniform length , and obtain a triangulated surface of size @xmath18 (= the total number of vertices ) , where @xmath17 is the number of division of an edge in the icosahedron . the obtained surfaces",
    "are thus characterized by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the total number of vertices with co - ordination number @xmath22 .",
    "those @xmath23-vertices and @xmath24-vertices respectively form pentagonal junctions and hexagonal junctions together with their nearest neighbor vertices , in the next stage .",
    "secondly , compartmentalized structures are obtained by dividing @xmath17 further into @xmath25-pieces ( @xmath26 ) , and we have uniform chains of length @xmath27 .",
    "those chains terminate at the above - described pentagonal or hexagonal junctions .",
    "these junctions include @xmath12 ( or @xmath28 ) vertices and @xmath29 ( or @xmath16 ) bonds according to whether they are pentagonal or hexagonal , and hence each junction has many degrees of freedom at this stage .",
    "thirdly , the junctions are assumed as rigid objects on the triangulated surfaces : the pentagonal ( hexagonal ) junction is identified with a regular pentagonal ( regular hexagonal ) plate . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath12 ( or @xmath28 ) vertices together with the @xmath29 ( or @xmath16 ) bonds are identified with a pentagon ( or a hexagon ) .",
    "thus , we have compartmentalized surfaces with rigid junctions as those shown in figs . [ fig-1](a ) and [ fig-1](b ) .    on the surfaces shown in figs . [ fig-1](a ) and [ fig-1](b ) , we have @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , respectively",
    ". we also note that the compartmentalized structures shown in figs . [",
    "fig-1](a ) and [ fig-1](b ) are identical to those of the model in @xcite except the fact that the junctions are rigid .",
    "the total number @xmath34 of the compartments depends on the surface size @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , @xmath34 is increased with increasing @xmath1 just as in the surfaces in @xcite .",
    "we choose the chain length @xmath4 between the junctions as constant so that it is independent of @xmath1 in the model .",
    "we fix the chain length @xmath4 such that @xmath35 which respectively correspond to the values @xmath36 , @xmath37 , the total number of vertices inside a compartment @xcite .",
    "the reason why we fix @xmath38 is because the size of compartment is considered to be finite in the cell membranes , and also because it is expected that total number of lipids in the compartment remains finite in the cell membranes .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is given by a linear combination of the two - dimensional gaussian bond potential @xmath39 , the one - dimensional bending energy @xmath40 , which are defined by @xmath41 in these expressions , @xmath42 in @xmath39 denotes the sum over all the bonds @xmath43 connecting the vertices @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and @xmath42 in @xmath40 denotes the sum over bonds @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which contain not only bonds in the chains but also _ virtual bonds _ that connect the center of a rigid junction and the neighboring vertices on the chains .",
    "the symbol @xmath46 in @xmath40 is the angle between the bonds @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which include the virtual bonds described just above .",
    "the gaussian potential @xmath39 is defined not only on the chains but also on all other bonds . as a consequence ,",
    "the model is considered to be a surface model , although the mechanical strength is maintained by one - dimensional elastic skeletons joined to each other at the rigid junctions .",
    "figure [ fig-2 ] shows a hexagonal rigid junction connected to chains , where the angle @xmath46 is defined not only at the vertices on the chains but also at the corners ( = _ virtual vertices _ ) of the junction .",
    "the triangular lattices attached to the chains were eliminated from the schematic drawing in fig .",

    "is defined not only at the vertices on the chains but also at the corners ( = virtual vertices ) of the junction .",
    "the triangular lattices attached to the chains were eliminated from the schematic drawing for simplicity . , width=396 ]    we must comment on the size of the junctions .",
    "the junctions are two - dimensional objects and therefore have their own size to be fixed .",
    "the size of junction can be specified by the edge length @xmath47 ; the perimeter length of the pentagonal ( hexagonal ) junction is therefore expressed by @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) . in this letter",
    ", we fix the size of the junctions such that @xmath50 the value @xmath51 is quite smaller than that of the elastic junctions in @xcite , where the edge length squared is @xmath52 because of the relation @xmath53 satisfied in the model of @xcite .",
    "since the junctions are two - dimensional rigid objects , it is expected that large - sized junctions influence equilibrium properties of the surface .",
    "therefore , in order to reduce such unclear size - effects we choose the size @xmath47 relatively small such as in eq.([junctionsize ] ) .",
    "we must note that the junctions in the snapshots of figs .",
    "[ fig-1](a),(b ) were drawn larger than that expected from eq.([junctionsize ] ) ; the junction size in the snapshots is fixed according to @xmath54 . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss how do we fix the size @xmath47 to the assumed value in eq.([junctionsize ] ) in the mc simulations .",
    "the partition function @xmath55 of the model is defined by @xmath56,\\quad     s(x)=s_1 + b s_2,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the bending rigidity corresponding to the one - dimensional bending energy , and @xmath58 denotes that the center of the surface is fixed .",
    "the integration @xmath59 is a product of the integration over vertices and that of junctions such that @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the integration over the degrees of freedom for three - dimensional translations and rotations .    the bending rigidity @xmath57 has unit of @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath64 is the temperature .",
    "the surface tension coefficient @xmath65 of @xmath39 is fixed to @xmath66 ; this is always possible because of the scale invariant property of the model .",
    "in fact , in the expression @xmath67 we immediately understand that @xmath66 is possible , because the factor @xmath65 of @xmath39 can be eliminated due to the scale invariance of the partition function . since the unit of @xmath65 is @xmath68 , the length unit of the model",
    "is given by @xmath69 .",
    "we use the unit of length provided by @xmath70 in this letter , although @xmath65 is arbitrarily chosen to be fixed .",
    "it must also be noted on the relation of the size @xmath47 in eq.([junctionsize ] ) to the thermodynamic limit @xmath71 . as discussed in the last part of the previous section , the limit @xmath71 is taken in our model so that the compartment size remains constant as in the model of @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath47 is also remained constant in the limit @xmath71 .",
    "the integration @xmath59 in the partition function is done by the canonical metropolis technique .",
    "the update of @xmath72 in mc can be divided into two steps , which are corresponding to the integrations @xmath73 and @xmath74 in eq.([integration ] ) .",
    "the first is the update of @xmath72 for the vertices including those on the chains : @xmath72 are shifted so that @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is randomly chosen in a small sphere .",
    "the new position @xmath77 is accepted with the probability @xmath78 $ ] , where @xmath79 .",
    "the second is the update of the position of the junctions as three - dimensional rigid objects .",
    "this can be further divided into two processes : the first is a random three - dimensional translation , and the second is a random three - dimensional rotation .",
    "all of these mc processes are independently performed under about @xmath80 acceptance rate , which is controlled by small numbers fixed at the beginning of the simulations .",
    "we introduce the lower bound @xmath81 for the area of triangles .",
    "no lower bound is imposed on the bond length .    the junction size @xmath47 is fixed to @xmath51 in eq.([junctionsize ] ) during the thermalization mcs .",
    "the initial value of @xmath47 is given by @xmath82 on the surfaces such as those shown in figs .",
    "[ fig-1](a ) and [ fig-1](b ) .",
    "thus , we reduce @xmath47 from @xmath83 to @xmath51 by @xmath84 at every @xmath85 mcs in the first @xmath86 mcs .",
    "because of this forced reduction of the junction size , the equilibrium statistical mechanical condition seems to be violated in the first @xmath86 mcs .",
    "therefore , relatively many thermalization ( @xmath87 or more ) mcs is performed after the reduction .",
    "further thermalization mcs should be performed , if necessary .",
    "we use surfaces of size @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 for the length @xmath30 , and @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 for the length @xmath32 .",

    "<S> a surface model with skeletons is investigated by using the canonical monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the skeleton is composed of linear chains , which are joined to each other at the rigid junctions . </S>",
    "<S> a one - dimensional bending energy is defined on the linear chains , and no two - dimensional curvature energy is assumed on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the model undergoes a first - order transition between the smooth phase and the crumpled phase . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the first - order transition of the surface model with skeletons is independent of whether the junctions are elastic or rigid .    ,    ,    ,    phase transition , extrinsic curvature , elastic membranes 64.60.-i , 68.60.-p , 87.16.dg </S>"
