    "locating oil reservoirs that are economically viable is one of the main problems in the petroleum industry .",
    "this task is primarily undertaken through seismic exploration , where explosive sources generate seismic waves whose reflections at the different geological layers are recorded at the ground or sea level by acoustic sensors ( geophones or hydrophones ) .",
    "these seismic signals , which are later processed to reveal information about possible oil occurrences , are often contaminated by noise and properly cleaning the data is therefore of paramount importance @xcite . in particular , the design of efficient filters to suppress noise that shows coherence in space and time ( and often appears stronger in magnitude than the desired signal ) remains a scientific challenge for which novel concepts and methods are required .",
    "in addition , the filtering tools developed to treat such kind of noise may also find relevant applications in other physical problems where coherent structures evolving in a complex spatiotemporal dynamics need to identified properly .    in land seismic surveys , the seismic sources generate various type of surface waves which are regarded as noise since they do not contain information from the deeper subsurface .",
    "this so - called coherent noise represents a serious hurdle in the processing of the seismic data since it may overwhelm the reflection signal , thus severely degrading the quality of the information that can be obtained from the data .",
    "a source - generated noise of particular concern is the ground roll , which is the main type of coherent noise in land seismic records and is commonly much stronger in amplitude than the reflected signals .",
    "ground roll are surface waves whose vertical components are rayleigh - type dispersive waves , with low frequency and low phase and group velocities .",
    "an example of seismic data contaminated by ground roll is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sismo ] .",
    "this seismic section consists of land  based data with 96 traces ( one for each geophone ) and 1001 samples per trace .",
    "a typical trace is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trazo ] corresponding to geophone 58 .",
    "the image shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sismo ] was created from the 96 traces using a standard imaging technique .",
    "the horizontal axis in this figure corresponds to the offset distance between source and receiver and the vertical axis represents time , with the origin located at the upper  left corner .",
    "the maximum offset is 475 m ( the distance between geophones being 5 m ) and the maximum time is 1000 ms .",
    "the gray levels in fig .  1 change linearly from black to white as the amplitude of the seismic signal varies from minimum to maximum . owing to its dispersive nature",
    ", the ground roll appears in a seismic image as a characteristic fan - like structure , which is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : sismo ] .",
    "the data shown in this figure was provided by the brazilian petroleum company ( petrobras ) .",
    "standard methods for suppressing ground roll include one - dimensional high  pass filtering and two - dimensional @xmath0@xmath1 filtering @xcite .",
    "such `` global '' filters are based on the elimination of specific frequencies and have the disadvantage that they also affect the uncontaminated part of the signal . recently ,",
    "`` local '' filters for suppressing the ground roll have been proposed using the karhunen - love transform @xcite and the wavelet transform @xcite .",
    "the wiener - levinson algorithm has also been applied to extract the ground roll @xcite .",
    "filters based on the karhunen  love ( kl ) transform are particularly interesting because of the _ adaptativity _ of the kl expansion , meaning that the original signal is decomposed in a basis that is obtained directly from the empirical data , unlike fourier and wavelet transforms which use prescribed basis functions .",
    "the kl transform is a mathematical procedure ( also known as proper orthogonal decomposition , empirical orthogonal function decomposition , principal component analysis , and singular value decomposition ) whereby any complicated data set can be optimally decomposed into a finite , and often small , number of modes ( called proper orthogonal modes , empirical orthogonal functions , principal components or eigenimages ) which are obtained from the eigenvectors of the data autocorrelation matrix . in applying the kl",
    "transform to suppress the ground roll , one must first map the contaminated region of the seismic record into a horizontal rectangular region .",
    "this transformed region is then decomposed with the kl transform and the first few principal components are removed to extract the coherent noise , after which the filtered data is inversely mapped back into the original seismic section .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the noise is suppressed with negligible distortion of the reflection signals , for only the data within the selected region is actually processed by the filter .",
    "earlier versions of the kl filter @xcite have however one serious drawback , namely , the fact that the region to be filtered must be picked by hand  a procedure that not only can be labor intensive but also relies on good judgment of the person performing the filtering .    in this article we propose a significant improvement of the kl filtering method , in which the region to be filtered is selected automatically as an optimization procedure .",
    "we introduce a novel quantity , namely , the coherence index @xmath2 , which gives a measure of the amount of energy contained in the most coherent modes for a given selected region .",
    "the optimal region is then chosen as that that gives the maximum @xmath2 .",
    "we emphasize that introducing a quantitative criterion for selecting the ` best ' region to be filtered has the considerable advantage of yielding a largely unsupervised scheme for demarcating and efficiently suppressing the ground roll .",
    "although our main motivation here concerns the suppression of coherent noise in seismic data , we should like to remark that our method may be applicable to other problems where coherent structures embedded in a complex spatiotemporal dynamics need to be identified or characterized in a more refined way .",
    "for example , the kl transform has been recently used to identify and extract spatial features from a complex spatiotemporal evolution in combustion experiment @xcite . a related method ",
    "the so - called biorthogonal decomposition  has also been applied to characterize spatiotemporal chaos and identified structures@xcite as well as identify changes in the dynamical complexity , and the spatial coherence of a multimode laser @xcite .",
    "we thus envision that our optimized kl filter may find applications in these and related problems of coherent structures in complex spatiotemporal dynamics .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : klt ] we define the karhunen  love transform , describe its main properties , and discuss its relation to the singular value decomposition of matrices . in sec .",
    "[ sec : kl ] we present the kl filter and a novel optimization procedure to select the noise - contaminated region to be parsed through the filter .",

    "a and b we briefly discuss , for completeness , the relation between the kl transform and two other similar procedures known as proper orthogonal decomposition ( or empirical orthogonal function expansion ) and principal component analysis .",
    "consider a multichannel seismic data consisting of @xmath3 traces with @xmath4 samples per trace represented by a @xmath5 matrix @xmath6 , so that the element @xmath7 of the data matrix corresponds to the amplitude registered at the @xmath8th geophone at time @xmath9 .",
    "for definiteness , let us assume that @xmath10 , as is usually the case .",
    "we also assume for simplicity that the matrix @xmath6 has full rank , i.e. , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the rank of @xmath6 . letting the vectors",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the elements of the @xmath8th row and the @xmath9th column of @xmath6 , respectively , we can write @xmath15 with the above notation we have @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the @xmath9th element of the vector @xmath18 . ( to avoid risk of confusion matrix elements",
    "will always be denoted by capital letters , so that a small - cap symbol with two subscripts indicates vector elements . )    next consider the following @xmath19 symmetric matrix @xmath20 where the superscript @xmath21 denotes matrix transposition .",
    "it is a well known fact from linear algebra that matrices of the form ( [ eg : g ] ) , also called covariance matrices , are positive definite .",
    ", as assumed ; if @xmath22 , the matrix @xmath23 has @xmath12 nonzero eigenvalues with all @xmath24 remaining eigenvalues equal to zero .",
    "] let us then arrange the eigenvalues @xmath25 of @xmath23 in non - ascending order , i.e. , @xmath26 , and let @xmath27 be the corresponding ( normalized ) eigenvectors .",
    "the karhunen - love ( kl ) transform of the data matrix @xmath6 is defined as the @xmath5 matrix @xmath28 given by @xmath29 where the columns of the matrix @xmath30 are the eigenvectors of @xmath23 : @xmath31 the original data can be recovered from the kl transform @xmath28 by the inverse relation @xmath32 we refer to this equation as the kl _ expansion _ of the data matrix @xmath6 .",
    "to render such an expansion more explicit let us denote by the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , the elements of the @xmath8th row of the kl matrix @xmath28 , that is , @xmath35 then ( [ eq : au ] ) can be written as @xmath36 where it is implied matrix multiplication between the column vector @xmath27 and the row vector @xmath33 .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath27 are called _ empirical eigenvectors _ , _ proper orthogonal modes _ , or _",
    "kl modes_.    as discussed in appendix  [ sec : pod ] , the total energy @xmath37 of the data can be defined as the sum of all eigenvalues , @xmath38 so that @xmath25 can be interpreted as the energy captured by the @xmath8th empirical eigenvector @xmath27 .",
    "we thus define the relative energy @xmath39 in the @xmath8th kl mode as @xmath40 we note furthermore that since @xmath23 is a covariance - like matrix its eigenvalues @xmath25 can also be interpreted as the variance of the respective principal component @xmath27 ; see appendix  [ sec : pca ] for more details on this interpretation .",
    "we thus say that the higher @xmath25 the more coherent the kl mode @xmath27 is . in this context , the most energetic modes are identified with the most coherent ones and vice - versa .",
    "an important property of the kl expansion is that it is ` optimal ' in the following sense : if we form the matrix @xmath41 by keeping the first @xmath1 rows of @xmath28 and setting the remaining @xmath42 rows to zero , then the matrix @xmath43 given by @xmath44 is the best approximation to @xmath6 by a matrix of rank @xmath45 in the frobenius norm ( the square root of the sum of the squares of all matrix elements ) @xcite .",
    "this optimality property of the kl expansion lies at the heart of its applications in data compression @xcite and dimensionality reduction @xcite , for it allows to approximate the original data @xmath6 by a smaller matrix @xmath43 with minimum loss of information ( in the above sense ) .",
    "another interpretation of relation ( [ eq : ak ] ) is that it gives a low - lass filter @xcite , for in this case only the first @xmath1 kl modes are retained in the filtered data @xmath43 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the relevant signal in the application at hand is contaminated with coherent noise , as is the case of the ground roll in seismic data , one can use the kl transform to remove efficiently such noise by constructing a high - pass filter . indeed ,",
    "if we form the matrix @xmath46 by setting to zero the first @xmath1 rows of @xmath28 and keeping the remaining ones , then the matrix @xmath47 given by @xmath48 is a filtered version of @xmath6 where the first @xmath1 ` most coherent ' modes have been removed .",
    "however , if the noise is localized in space and time it is best to apply the filter only to the contaminated part of the signal . in previous versions of the kl filter",
    "the choice of the region to be parsed through the filter was made _ a priori _ , according to the best judgement of the person carrying out the filtering , thus lending a considerable degree of subjectivity to the process . in the next section",
    ", we will show how one can use the kl expansion to implement an automated filter where the undesirable coherent structure can be ` optimally ' identified and removed .    before going into that ,",
    "however , we shall briefly discuss below an important connection between the kl transform and an analogous mathematical procedure known as the singular value decomposition of matrices .",
    "readers already knowledgeable about the equivalence between these two formalisms ( or more interested in the specific application of the kl transform to filter coherent noise ) may skip the remainder of this section without loss of continuity .",
    "we recall that the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of any @xmath49 matrix @xmath6 , with @xmath10 , is given by the following expression : @xmath50 where @xmath30 is as defined in ( [ eq : u ] ) , @xmath51 is a @xmath19 diagonal matrix with elements @xmath52 , the so - called _ singular values _ of @xmath6 , and @xmath53 is a @xmath5 matrix whose columns correspond to the @xmath3 eigenvectors @xmath54 of the matrix @xmath55 with nonzero eigenvalues .",
    "the svd allows us to rewrite the matrix @xmath6 as a sum of matrices of unitary rank : @xmath56 in the context of image processing the matrices @xmath57 are called _ eigenimages _ @xcite .",
    "now , comparing ( [ eq : au ] ) with ( [ svda ] ) we see that the kl transform @xmath28 is related to the svd matrices @xmath51 and @xmath53 by the following relation @xmath58 so that the row vectors @xmath33 of @xmath28 are given in terms of the singular values @xmath59 and the vectors @xmath60 by @xmath61 it thus follows that the decomposition in eigenimages seen in ( [ eq : q ] ) is precisely the kl expansion given in ( [ eq : uxi ] ) . furthermore the approximation @xmath43 given in ( [ eq : ak ] ) can be written in terms of eigenimages as @xmath62 similarly , the filtered data @xmath63 shown in ( [ eq : atilk ] ) reads in terms of eigenimages : @xmath64 the svd provides an efficient way to compute the kl transform , and we shall use this method in the numerical procedures described in the paper .",
    "as already mentioned , owing to its dispersive nature the ground - roll noise appears in a seismic image as a typical fan - like coherent structure .",
    "this space - time localization of the ground roll allows us to apply a sort of ` surgical procedure ' to suppress the noise , leaving intact the uncontaminated region . to do that , we first pick lines to demarcate the start and end of the ground roll and , if necessary , intermediate lines to demarcate different wavetrains , as indicated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : sector ] . in this figure",
    "we have for simplicity used straight lines to demarcate the sectors but more general alignment functions , such as segmented straight lines , can also be chosen @xcite . to make our discussion as general as possible ,",
    "let us assume that we have a set of @xmath65 parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 , describing our alignment functions .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig : sector ] the parameters @xmath66 would correspond to the coefficients of the straight lines defining each sector .",
    "once the region contaminated by the ground roll has been demarcated , we map each sector onto a horizontal rectangular region by shifting and stretching along the time axis ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : sector ] . the data points between the top and bottom lines in each sector is mapped into the corresponding new rectangular domain , with the mapping being carried out via a cubic convolution interpolation technique @xcite .",
    "after this alignment procedure the ground roll events will become approximately horizontal , favoring its decomposition in a smaller space .",
    "since any given transformed sector has a rectangular shape it can be represented by a matrix , which in turn can be decomposed in empirical orthogonal modes ( eigenimages ) using the kl transform .",
    "the first few modes , which contain most of the ground roll , are then subtracted to extract the coherent noise .",
    "the resulting data for each transformed sector is finally subjected to the corresponding inverse mapping to compensate for the original forward mapping .",
    "this leaves the uncontaminated data ( lying outside the demarcated sectors ) unaffected by the whole filtering procedure .",
    "the kl filter described above has indeed shown good performance in suppressing source - generated noise from seismic data @xcite .",
    "the method has however the drawback that the region to be filtered must be picked by hand , which renders the analysis somewhat subjective . in order to overcome this difficulty",
    ", it would be desirable to have a quantitative criterion based on which one could decide what is the ` best choice ' for the parameters @xmath66 describing the alignment functions .",
    "in what follows , we propose an optimization procedure whereby the region to be filtered can be selected automatically , once the generic form of the alignment functions is prescribed .",
    "suppose we have chosen @xmath68 sectors to demarcate the different wavetrains in the contaminated region of the original data , and let @xmath69 be the set of parameters characterizing the respective alignment functions that define these sectors .",
    "let us denote by @xmath70 , @xmath71 , the matrix representing the @xmath1th transformed sector obtained from the linear mapping of the respective original sector , as discussed above .",
    "for each transformed sector @xmath70 we then compute its kl transform and calculate the _ coherence index _",
    "@xmath72 for this sector , defined as the relative energy contained in its first kl mode : @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the rank of @xmath70 . such as defined above , @xmath72 represents the relative weight of the most coherent mode in the kl expansion of the transformed sector @xmath70 .",
    "( a quantity analogous to our @xmath2 is known in the oceanography literature as the similarity index @xcite . )",
    "next we introduce an overall coherence index @xmath77 for the entire demarcated region , defined as the average coherence index of all sectors : @xmath78 as the name suggests , the coherence index @xmath2 is a measure of the amount of ` coherent energy ' contained in the chosen demarcated region given by the parameters @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the higher @xmath2 the larger the energy contained in the most coherent modes in that region . for the purpose of filtering coherent noise",
    "it is therefore mostly favorable to pick the region with the largest possible @xmath2 .",
    "we thus propose the following criterion to select the optimal region to be filtered : vary the parameters @xmath66 over some appropriate range and then choose the values @xmath80 that maximize the coherence index @xmath2 , that is , @xmath81 .",
    "\\label{eq : ci*}\\ ] ] once we have selected the optimal region , given by the parameters @xmath82 , we then simply apply the kl filter to this region as already discussed : we remove the first few eigenimages from each transformed sector and inversely map the data back into the original sectors , so as to obtain the final filtered image . in the next section",
    "we will apply our optimized kl filtering procedure to the seismic data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sismo ] .",
    "here we illustrate how our optimized kl filter works by applying it to the seismic data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sismo ] . in this case",
    ", it suffices to choose only one sector to demarcate the entire region contaminated by the ground roll .",
    "this means that we have to prescribe only two alignment functions , corresponding to the uppermost and lowermost straight lines ( lines ab and cd , respectively ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : sector ] . to reduce further the number of free parameters in the problem ,",
    "let us keep the leftmost point of the upper line ( point a in fig .",
    "[ fig : sector ] ) fixed to the origin , so that the coordinates @xmath83 of point a are set to @xmath84 , while allowing the point @xmath85 to move freely up or down within certain range ; see below .",
    "similarly , we shall keep the rightmost point of the lower line ( point c in fig .",
    "[ fig : sector ] ) pinned at a point @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 is chosen so that the entire ground roll wavetrain is above this point .",
    "the other endpoint of the lower demarcation line ( point @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sector ] ) is allowed to vary freely . with such restrictions ,",
    "we are left with only two free parameters , namely , the angles @xmath90 and @xmath91 that the upper and lower demarcation lines make with the horizontal axis .",
    "so reducing the dimensionality of our parameter space allows us to visualize the coherence index @xmath92 as a 2d surface . for the case in hand ,",
    "it is more convenient however to express @xmath2 not as a function of the angles @xmath90 and @xmath91 but in terms of two other new parameters introduced below .",
    "let the coordinates of point @xmath85 , which defines the right endpoint of the upper demarcation line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sector ] , be given by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 . in our optimization procedure",
    "we let point @xmath85 move along the right edge of the seismic section by allowing the coordinate @xmath95 to vary from a minimum value @xmath96 to a maximum value @xmath97 , so that we can write @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the number of intermediate sampling points between @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and @xmath100 .",
    "similarly , for the coordinates @xmath101 of point @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sector ] , which is the moving endpoint of the lower straight line , we have @xmath102 and @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the number of sampling points between @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .    for each choice of @xmath1 and @xmath68 in ( [ eq : jb ] ) and ( [ eq : jd ] ) , we apply the procedure described in the previous section and obtain the coherence index @xmath108 of the corresponding region . in fig .",

    "we see in this figure that @xmath2 possesses a sharp peak , thus showing that this criterion is indeed quite discriminating with respect to the positioning of the lines demarcating the region contaminated by the ground roll . the global maximum of @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : energ ] is located at @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : transf]a we show the transformed sector obtained from the linear mapping of this optimal region . in this figure",
    "one clearly sees that the ground roll wavetrains appear mostly as horizontal events . in fig .",
    "[ fig : transf]b we present the first eigenimage of the data shown in fig .",

    "a great advantage of the kl filter lies in its local nature , meaning that only the contaminated region of the seismic record is processed by the filter , which allows the ground roll to be removed without distorting most of the reflection signal .",
    "another advantage is that it is an adaptative method in the sense the the signal is decomposed in an empirical basis obtained from the data itself .",

    "if the rows of @xmath6 are centered , i.e. , the variables @xmath142 have zero mean , then the matrix @xmath23 is proportional to the covariance matrix @xmath145 of @xmath143 : instead of @xmath146 , but this is not relevant for our discussion here . ] @xmath147 or alternatively in matrix notation @xmath148 [ note that the matrices @xmath124 and @xmath145 defined respectively in ( [ eq : r ] ) and ( [ eq : s ] ) are essentially the same but have different interpretations . ] in the pca context , the diagonal elements @xmath149 of the matrix @xmath23 are thus proportional to the variance of the variables @xmath142 , whereas the off - diagonal elements @xmath150 , @xmath151 , are proportional to the covariance between the variables @xmath142 and @xmath152 . furthermore , the eigenvectors @xmath27 of @xmath23 correspond to the principal axis of the covariance matrix @xmath145 . the idea behind",
    "pca is to introduce a new set of @xmath3 variables @xmath153 , each of which being a linear combination of the original variables @xmath142 , such that these new variables are mutually uncorrelated .",
    "this is accomplished by projecting the vector @xmath143 onto the principal directions of the covariance matrix .",
    "more precisely , we define the principal components @xmath153 , @xmath34 , by the following relation @xmath154 in other words , the vector of principal components @xmath155 is obtained from a rotation of the original vector @xmath143 : @xmath156 the covariance matrix @xmath157 of the principal components is then given by @xmath158 thus showing that @xmath159 as desired . the first principal component @xmath160 then represents the particular linear combination of the original variables @xmath142 ( among all possible such combinations that yield mutually uncorrelated variables ) that has the largest variance , with the second principal component possessing the second largest variance , and so on .    from ( [ eq : psi ] ) and ( [ eq : p ] )",
    "one sees that the elements of the @xmath8th row of the kl transform @xmath28 correspond to the @xmath4 samples or _ scores _ of the @xmath8th principal component . that is , if we denote the sample vector of the @xmath8th principal component by @xmath161 , then @xmath162 .",
    "for this reason in the pca context the kl transform @xmath28 is called the matrix of scores ."
