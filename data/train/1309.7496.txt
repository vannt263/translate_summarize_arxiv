    "<S> in this paper , we consider tachyonic scalar field as a model of dark energy with interaction between components in the case of variable @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume a flat universe with specific form of scale factor and study cosmological parameters numerically and graphically . </S>",
    "<S> statefinder analysis also performed as well . in the special choice of interaction parameters we succeed to obtain analytical expression of densities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our model will be stable in the late stage but there is an instability at the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> so we propose this model as a realist model of our universe . </S>",
    "<S> +   + * keywords : * cosmology ; early universe ; cosmological parameters ; dark matter .    [ [ section ] ]    in order to explain recent observational data , which reveals accelerating expansion of the universe , several models were proposed . </S>",
    "<S> one of the possible scenarios is the existence of a dark energy with negative pressure and positive energy density giving an acceleration to the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> + various kinds of dark energy models have been proposed such as cosmological constant [ 1 ] , quintessence [ 2 - 4 ] , k - essence [ 5 - 7 ] , tachyon [ 8 - 11 ] , phantom [ 12 - 14 ] , ghost dark energy [ 15 - 18 ] , chaplygin gas and its extensions [ 19 - 28 ] , quintom [ 29 ] , holographic dark energy [ 30 - 34 ] , and extra dimensions [ 35 , 36 ] . + among above models concerning to the nature of the dark component of the universe , in this article , we assume that it could be described by a scalar field and we choose a scalar field called tachyonic field with the following relativistic lagrangian , @xmath2 which captured a lot of attention ( see , for instance , references in [ 37 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the stress energy tensor is given by , @xmath3 which gives the energy density and pressure as the following expressions , @xmath4 and , @xmath5 our next step is to decompose eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) as follow , @xmath6 with the following components , @xmath7 and , @xmath8 it means that we can consider tachyonic scalar field as a combination of a cosmological constant and pressureless matter with @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> from mathematical point of view this is not only one possibility and rather different splitting could be considered . </S>",
    "<S> + we should note that , flat frw metric with the following line element , @xmath10 will be used for our purposes . </S>",
    "<S> + recently , ref . [ 37 ] considered a model , where the components of a tachyonic scalar field interact mutually . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the idea of that work , we would like to consider interaction @xmath11 of the general form between components in the case of variable @xmath0 and @xmath1 . as we know </S>",
    "<S> the einstein equation has two important parameters which are the gravitational constant @xmath0 and the cosmological constant @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that @xmath0 plays the role of a coupling constant between geometry and matter in the einstein equations . in an evolving universe </S>",
    "<S> , it appears natural to look at this constant as a function of time [ 38 , 39 ] . </S>",
    "<S> also , time - dependent cosmological constant has been considered by several works in various variable @xmath0 theories [ 40 , 41 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to point out boundary on @xmath0 for instance , observation of spinning - down rate of pulsar @xmath12 provides the result , @xmath13 depending on the observations of pulsating white dwarf star @xmath14 , the astroseismological bound may be [ 42 ] , @xmath15 today , @xmath1 has the incredibly small value , @xmath16 , whereas generic inflation models require that @xmath1 has a large value during the inflationary epoch . </S>",
    "<S> this is the source of the cosmological constant problem . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that consideration of variable @xmath1 could solve such problem . also in a pioneer work on varying cosmological constant and its interaction with matter suggested to resolve the fine - tuning problem [ 43 ] . </S>",
    "<S> so , we apply these idea to the recent work [ 37 ] and extend this model . </S>",
    "<S> + also , interacting models may solve the cosmic coincidence problem [ 44 , 45 ] . in the ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ 46 ] it is found that the interaction between dark sectors can not ensure the dark energy to fully cluster along with dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> there are several possibilities to choose interaction term for example those introduced in the ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ 47 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to construct holographic cosmological model where dark matter and dark energy interact non - gravitationally with each other [ 48 ] . in the interesting work [ 49 ] the effects of interaction between dark matter and dark energy on the evolution of the gravitational and the peculiar velocity fields investigated . in the recent work [ 50 ] </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that an interaction is compatible with the recent observations and can provide a strong argument towards consistency of different values of cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> all of these give us motivation to use interaction in the model to have a comprehensive model . </S>",
    "<S> + this paper organized as follows , in next section we will introduce the equations which governs our model . </S>",
    "<S> then , we study statefinder diagnostics . also we will consider mathematics and solving strategy of the problem for non interacting case and will present analysis of the model for special type of scale factor . </S>",
    "<S> model including interaction between components analyzed numerically and cosmological parameters discussed graphically . </S>",
    "<S> last section includes discussions and conclusion .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-1 ] ]    field equations that govern our model with variable @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see for instance [ 41 ] ) are , @xmath19 and , @xmath20 energy density ( 3 ) and pressure ( 4 ) of a tachyonic field reduced to following expressions , @xmath21 and , @xmath22 also , energy conservation @xmath23 reads as , @xmath24 in the case of conservation of particle number in universe , combination of ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 15 ) gives the following relationship between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 hereafter we will assume special forms of scale factor @xmath28 and cosmological constant @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption allows us to determine @xmath17 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . before investigation of these quantities we study statefinder diagnostics . </S>"
