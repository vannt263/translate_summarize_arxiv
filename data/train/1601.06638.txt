    "mergers are particularly important , contributing to the stellar mass growth of galaxies , triggering star formation , inducing nuclear activity and leading to morphological transformation .    if major mergers are actually common , it is difficult to explain the very low scatter seen in the fundamental plane scaling relations even at redshifts approaching 1 and beyond .",
    "major dry mergers ( between two gas - poor quiescent galaxies ) may offer an escape from this apparent contradiction , as they are believed not to affect the scaling relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "major mergers in present - day clusters are not expected to be frequent , as the encounter velocities between cluster galaxies are much higher than the internal velocity dispersions of the galaxies , preventing their coalescence @xcite .",
    "therefore , the evolution in the mass function of cluster galaxies should closely follow that seen in the wider field and group populations which are continually accreted into the clusters over time @xcite .",
    "in fact , the cluster galaxy mass function appears not to have evolved significantly since @xmath3 or even earlier ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "some recent results are shedding new light on the merger activity in the local universe .",
    "very deep imaging studies of local ( @xmath4 ) field early - type galaxies have reported that features such as broad fans , ripples , shells , streams and tidal tails are found in 50 - 70% of them , pointing to recent mass assembly through dry mergers @xcite . in a similar deep optical survey of four rich clusters at @xmath4 ( a119 , a389 , a2670 , a3330 ) , @xcite also identified such features in @xmath5% of rs cluster galaxies , a result particularly surprising for such environments .",
    "@xcite suggested that these faint features could be residuals of mergers which took place several gyr ago , prior to the galaxies being accreted into the clusters themselves .",
    "performed hydrodynamical simulations of major merging galaxies indicating that post - merger signatures could remain detectable for 3 - 4 gyr .    in this letter",
    "we consider the use of close pair fractions and image inspection to estimate the dry merger rate of galaxies in the coma cluster ( @xmath6 ) and the fraction of post - merger , or merger remnant , galaxies in the rs , using the extensive available spectroscopic information and deep hst imaging obtained with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) for the coma treasury survey ( cts ) .",
    "these measurements are not only useful for comparison with similar investigations of low - z clusters , but also constitute a suitable counterpart to previous studies of distant clusters ( @xmath7 ) where high merger fractions have been claimed based on galaxy pair counts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the much better data quality available for local systems allows us to identify signs of on - going interactions and explore systematic effects on the determination of the merger rate .",
    "this analysis is based on a complete spectroscopic sample of rs galaxies consisting of gas - poor elliptical and lenticular galaxies .",
    "the dry merger rate is derived from the number of close pairs that show signs of galaxy - galaxy interactions in the model subtracted images of the component galaxies .",
    "we also estimate the post - merger fraction in coma from the number of galaxies in the complete rs sample that show remnant features from a past coalescense , for comparison with the results of @xcite . a cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 is adopted .",
    "we select coma galaxies within the footprint ( fig .",

    "the angular scale for coma is 0.472 kpc arcsec@xmath11 .",
    "the cts provides high quality ( @xmath12arcsecpixel@xmath11 ) imaging in both f475w ( @xmath13 ) and f814w ( @xmath14 ) hst filters , and only the galaxies contained therein are covered by our analysis . the surface brightness limit ( sbl )",

    "nineteen pointings , out of 25 , cover roughly 20 per cent of the projected area within 0.5 mpc from the coma center .",

    "however , if we add the difference in line - of - sight velocity criteria of @xmath29kms@xmath11 we find a total of 13 galaxies ( listed in table 1 ) in five pairs and one triple system , all of them contained within the 19 acs central pointings .",
    "these cuts on @xmath30 and @xmath31 are similar to those used in the literature for pair count based merger rate estimations @xcite .",
    "stellar mass ratios for the selected pairs range from @xmath181:1 to @xmath181:3 , that is , if they are actually physically related they could evolve into major mergers .",
    "we investigate statistically the likelihood that these five observed close pairs and a close triple system are interacting and will merge in the future , or if instead they are simply chance alignments due to the high density of cluster galaxies in projected phase - space . for this calculation",
    "we adopt spherical symmetry . considering all",
    "known coma cluster members within @xmath1 ( 1.99 @xmath32 mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and having sdss @xmath33 photometry , equivalent @xmath34 color and @xmath35-band magnitude cuts to that used to identify our red sequence population in the acs f814w and f475w imaging are applied .",
    "the position angles of these red sequence coma galaxies are randomized with respect to the center of the x - ray emission from coma , and their velocities randomized by repeatedly swapping the redshifts of cluster members .",
    "this randomization process should model the expected galaxy density of the virialized population of galaxies in the coma core , in which all resulting pairs are just chance projections along the line of sight .",
    "the expected number of galaxy pairs , with the adopted @xmath30 and @xmath31 limits , that would be found within the 19 acs images based on 10,000 randomized coma red sequence populations is @xmath36 , including @xmath37 triples ( or more complex systems ) .",
    "the predicted numbers are entirely consistent with the observed number of pairs / triplets , indicating that they all could be simply chance alignments .",
    "nevertheless , this calculation does not rule out some of the observed pairs actually being physical ones . in order to test this ,",
    "we search for evidence of recent or on - going interactions between galaxies belonging to the observed pairs / triplets .",
    "the search for evidence of recent galaxy - galaxy interactions in the 5 pairs and one triplet identified in section [ pair selection ] requires the generation of model subtracted images for the 13 member galaxies . in most cases , it is on these residual images only that tidally induced low surface brightness features can be discerned .",
    "the adopted galaxy models come from @xcite .",
    "they were obtained using galfit @xcite , considering up to three sersic sub - components .",
    "single sersic profile models were separated into photometric ellipticals and disks , while multi - component models were classified as s0 and e depending on the index of their main component .",
    "the morphological classification and sersic index for each galaxy is given in table 1 .",
    "features generated by recent galaxy - galaxy interactions generally tend to be highly asymmetric , such as tails , arcs , shells , ripples , bridges , and asymmetric spiral arms .",
    "in contrast , most internal features generated through internal instabilities tend to be symmetric with respect to the galaxy center or with respect to some reflection axis .",
    "these internal perturbations are easily distinguishable in the galfit residuals from the highly asymmetric interaction - driven features .",
    "tidal interactions and minor mergers may also induce `` bar - like '' elongated structures , which tend to display asymmetries ( e.g. , in length , axial ratio and shapes of dust lanes ) not seen in internally - induced bars .",
    "unperturbed galaxies should show smooth gradients towards the outer parts of the galaxy and no noticeable asymmetric structures on the residuals , leaving only minor residuals , such as those arising from the boxy or disky profiles present in some ellipticals or from the presence of bars .",
    "figure 3 displays f814w images for the 13 galaxies in the selected pairs / triplet , the model subtracted image , and residuals after subtraction of the galaxy after rotation by @xmath38 .",
    "model residuals are smoothed to highlight medium and large - structures . to facilitate the diagnoses from the residual images after galaxy rotation ,",
    "the foreground and background bright sources are masked .",
    "after model subtraction , the presence of structures such as bars and disk or boxy light profiles can be observed in some of the residual images .",
    "these are all symmetric with respect to the galaxy center , and are thus likely to be a result of internal processes ( e.g. bars ) . examples of residuals caused by bars can be seen for ic 4030 and pgc 44636",
    ". the boxy profile of ic 4033 is revealed on the corresponding residual image . in all cases ,",
    "the structures observed in the residuals appear to be symmetrical with respect to the galaxy center , consistent with the expectations for inner galaxy structures .",
    "we have also examined a pair that did not qualify to be included in table 1 , ngc 4898a / b but that is of particular interest , because of the small projected separation of 2.59 h@xmath11 kpc and comparable f814w magnitudes ( 13.42 and 14.38 ) of the two galaxies .",
    "although the difference in their radial velocities is 532kms@xmath11 , higher than the cut employed here , it is lower than the average difference between the pairs selected by projected distance ( @xmath39 ) . still , it is large enough to make coalescence unlikely .",
    "a visual inspection of the images of this projected pair reveals high overlapping , while the residuals of the galfit models reveal asymmetric structures on both galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , these features can not unmistakenly be regarded as result of an ongoing interaction since the correct modeling becomes more difficult to achieve when the two galaxies overlap .    in conclusion , for the candidate",
    "bound pairs / triplet we do not find indications of low - surface brightness features attributable to recent galaxy - galaxy interactions .      the asymmetry parameter @xmath40 is measured for the 13 galaxies in the pairs / triplet following the procedure by @xcite where the intensity of the galaxy and a @xmath38 rotated image of itself is compared pixel to pixel .",
    "values for @xmath40 range from 0 for a completely symmetric light distribution to 1 for one that is completely asymmetric .",
    "a correction for uncorrelated noise from the background is applied computing the asymmetry parameter for a synthetic area of the same size and rms noise measured close to the galaxy .",
    "sky level subtraction and masking of fore / background sources is applied in order to minimize the effect of non - galactic sources .",
    "typical values for unperturbed early - type galaxies range from 0.01 to 0.1 while irregular and starburst galaxies have been found to have values of 0.2 - 1.0 @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry parameters determined for these 13 galaxies are listed in table 1 .",
    "their parameters lie in the 0.02 - 0.06 range , corresponding to unperturbed galaxies , a result consistent with the conclusions of section [ visual ] .",
    "the merger timescale for a given number of physical pairs can be estimated using the formula by @xcite , which considers typical stellar masses and distances between pair members .",
    "the merger timescale is given by @xmath41 in section 3.1 , we selected 13 galaxies ( 18.5 % of the complete sample ) complying with the adopted @xmath30 and @xmath31 limits , whose median mass and projected separation are @xmath42 and @xmath43 h@xmath11kpc , respectively .",
    "if , tentatively , it is assumed that these 13 galaxies are actually in interacting systems , then using the above formula a merger timescale of @xmath44 gyr is obtained , that would lead to a nominal dry merger rate of 11.2% per gyr in the coma core .    however , the visual inspection and asymmetry determination conducted for these 13 galaxies do not provide evidence that they are in interacting systems .",
    "this null result , allows nevertheless an estimation of the dry merger rate by using binomial statistics .",
    "we follow the procedure by @xcite , where the @xmath451@xmath17 range of acceptable values for the pair fractions are defined as a function of the sample size and pair fraction . from our finding of the number of pairs ( n=0 ) for a sample size of 70 galaxies ( n=70 ) we find an upper limit for the merger fraction of @xmath46 . considering the merger time - scale of @xmath44 gyr estimated above ,",
    "we obtain a 1-sigma upper limit for the major dry merger rate of @xmath47 per gyr within the coma cluster core .",
    "this is not sufficient for dry mergers to account for the red sequence evolution inside clusters @xcite , consistent only with growth rates of @xmath48 since @xmath49 as derived by several previous studies @xcite .",
    "the complete sample of red sequence galaxies is inspected to estimate the fraction which show signatures of the coalescence of two galaxies , such as ripples , tidal structures , halo discontinuities , shells , and other structures unrelated to the presence of a companion . using images to a sbl of @xmath1826.5magarcsec@xmath16 ,",
    "only 1 out of the 70 rs galaxies is classified as a post - merger .",
    "the only remnant candidate found is ic3973 , which is previously identified as a member of one of the five pairs and the triple system in sect .",
    "[ visual ] .",
    "this galaxy is not identified as a member of an on - going merger since the observed feature does not appear to be related to the presence of the projected partner , and the partner itself does not show any evidence of perturbation .",
    "the asymmetry parameter determined for this galaxy is 0.0419 , a value still small for a perturbed galaxy ; we believe that this parameter does not actually reflect the merger remnant character detected visually due to the low surface brightness of its external halo compared with the galaxy nucleus . in the direct f814w image of this galaxy ( fig .",
    "4 , upper panel ) , the outer halo of the galaxy appears to be rotated and shifted with respect to the inner bright core , while in the residual image ( lower panel ) , a curved extension is apparent coming out clockwise from the low right corner of the galaxy halo .    finding only one candidate merger remnant galaxy ,",
    "implies a post - merger fraction in the coma cluster core of @xmath50 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the estimate ( 3% ) of @xcite , to similar surface brightness limits .",
    "however , our value is much smaller than the @xmath51 mean fraction determined by @xcite , even within @xmath52 ( their fig .",
    "14 ) , in four @xmath4 abell clusters using images with a sbl of @xmath53magarcsec@xmath16 .",
    "on the one hand , by combining the identification of close pairs with the requirement of galaxy asymmetries , we find no evidence for major on - going mergers in a spectroscopically complete sample of 70 red sequence galaxies within @xmath54 from the center of coma and derive an upper limit to the dry merger rate of @xmath55% per gyr at the 1-@xmath17 sigma level .",
    "this rate is not sufficient for dry mergers to account for the red sequence evolution inside clusters .    on the other hand",
    ", we find that from the 70 galaxies in our sample only one shows evidence of low surface brightness features identifiable as the remnants of a past merger or interaction , yielding a post - merger fraction of 1.4% within a projected distance of @xmath56 from the coma center .",
    "although the coma brightest member ( ngc 4889 ) is not in our sample , it actually is a red sequence galaxy sitting in the cluster center , and interestingly , it has been found to contain a system of shells identifiable to a minor ( @xmath181/100 ) merger @xcite .",
    "if ngc 4889 would have been part of our sample , presumabley it would have been counted as a galaxy with tidal signatures , implying a larger post - merger fraction , of @xmath18 2.8 % .",
    "there is however a relevant caveat that derives from the work of @xcite on ngc 4889 , i.e. that an observation alone of tidal signatures in a galaxy may sometimes be the consequence of a very minor merger .",
    "the small post - merger fraction we observe is consistent with similar results such as the one by @xcite , where @xmath57 of a large sample of early - type galaxies in clusters ( @xmath58 ) have evidence of tidal features found on imaging with surface brightness limits comparable to those of the hst imaging employed by us in this study .",
    "however , it is puzzling that the post - merger fraction we observe is a factor of 10 lower than the one measured by @xcite in four @xmath4 clusters .",
    "this discrepancy merits further investigation with due consideration to differences in survey limits and cluster evolutionary stage .",
