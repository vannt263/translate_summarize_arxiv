    "hadrons containing a single @xmath0 quark hold the key to many important questions facing particle physics .",
    "in particular , the weak decays of these particles are being studied to look for inconsistencies in the standard model and indications of new physics beyond it .",
    "lattice calculations have a central and fundamental role to play in this pursuit . not only is lattice theory a first principles approach but also offers the most reliable way to calculate the masses of heavy - light hadrons and the low - energy qcd factors which are needed to extract the electroweak physics from experiment .",
    "an introduction to @xmath6 physics and the theoretical advances in this field , for example heavy quark effective theory  ( hqet ) , as well as the contribution made from lattice theory , can be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "the aim of a lattice calculation of @xmath6 meson phenomenology is to produce reliable predictions where the systematic errors , such as finite lattice spacing , finite volume and quenching , are understood and under control .",
    "our approach is to systematically improve the actions used for the heavy and light quark and to use lattices with physical volumes large enough to accommodate at least the lower lying @xmath6 mesons .",
    "in particular , we simulate the @xmath0 quark on the lattice using nrqcd : a cut - off of the order of the heavy mass is imposed and we can not extrapolate to the continuum .",
    "this requires the systematic errors to be reduced to the order of the statistical errors at finite @xmath16 . in this paper",
    ", we argue that the uncertainty arising from finite @xmath17 , volume , and the truncation of the nrqcd series are under control and it is now reasonable to investigate the effects of quenching . as a first step towards predicting @xmath6-meson properties in full qcd , we perform a simulation of the @xmath6 spectrum and decay constants including two degenerate flavours of dynamical quarks .",
    "we then make a comparison with our previous nrqcd calculations on quenched configurations  @xcite and study the sensitivity of various quantities to the presence of sea quarks .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the next section we describe the details of the simulation .",
    "each choice of quark action and simulation parameter leads to an associated systematic error and the corresponding effect on predictions for the @xmath6 spectrum and decay constants are discussed in section  [ errors ] .",
    "results for the spectrum are presented in section  [ spec ] and compared with experiment .",
    "we then study the effect of sea quarks on the @xmath6 spectrum and @xmath7 in section  [ nfspectrum ] .",
    "the next section deals with the pseudoscalar and vector decay constants .",
    "the lattice operators required to compute the decay constants to @xmath1 and the corresponding @xmath18-loop perturbative matching factors are introduced and discussed . in addition , the expectations from heavy quark symmetry  ( hqs ) for the heavy quark mass dependence of these quantities is outlined .",
    "our results for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are presented in section  [ decayresults ] and their dependence on the heavy quark mass is investigated .",
    "finally , we present a detailed study of sea quarks effects in the decay constants .",
    "the simulations were performed using 100 @xmath23 gauge configurations at @xmath24 with two flavours of staggered dynamical sea quarks with a bare quark mass of @xmath25 , which roughly corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "these configurations were generously made available by the collaboration ; more details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we fixed the configurations to the coulomb gauge .",
    "the light quark propagators were generated using the clover fermion action at three values of the hopping parameter , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . from an analysis of the light hadron spectrum  @xcite , the second @xmath30 value corresponds to a quark mass close to strange , where @xmath31 from @xmath32 , @xmath33 from @xmath34 and @xmath35 from @xmath36 ; @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath2 improvement term in the clover action is implemented with a tadpole - improved value for the clover coefficient , @xmath38 .",
    "this amounts to dividing all the gauge links by @xmath39 , where we use @xmath40 measured from the plaquette , and setting the coefficient to the tree - level value @xmath41 . in order to improve matrix elements to the same order as the spectrum",
    ", we use the prescription proposed by the fermilab group  @xcite and replace the quark field normalisation @xmath42 with @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .    in this simulation",
    "we truncate the nrqcd series at @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the bare heavy quark mass , and the action takes the form : @xmath47 where @xmath48 tadpole improvement of the gauge links is used throughout and the hyperfine coefficient is given the tree - level value @xmath49 .",
    "we use the standard clover - leaf operator for the @xmath6 field .",
    "the heavy quark propagators were computed using the evolution equation  @xcite : @xmath50 for all @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the stabilising parameter .",
    "we generated heavy quark propagators at 10 values of ( @xmath53,n ) corresponding to ( 0.8,5 ) , ( 1.0,4 ) , ( 1.2,3 ) , ( 1.7,2 ) , ( 2.0,2 ) , ( 3.0,2 ) , ( 3.5,2 ) , ( 4.0,2 ) , ( 7.0,1 ) and ( 10.0,1 ) .",
    "this roughly corresponds to a range of meson masses from @xmath54 to @xmath55 and is sufficient for a reasonable investigation of heavy quark symmetry .",
    "results in the static limit are not presented .",
    "we were not able to improve on the quality of the signal compared to previous results using wilson light fermions  @xcite , and in this case the extrapolation of the nrqcd results to the static limit was considered more reliable than results at the static point itself . to improve statistics",
    "we have also calculated the propagators on the time - reversed configurations .",
    "details of the fitting analysis and extraction of the spectral quantities and decay constants from the heavy - light meson correlators can be found in the appendix .",
    "in this section we discuss the systematic errors associated with our choice of quark actions and simulation parameters . in previous work",
    "we used wilson light fermions which was estimated to introduce the largest systematic error into the calculation of heavy - light quantities .",
    "for tadpole - improved clover fermions the systematic errors are now estimated to be a relative error of @xmath56  ( where we take @xmath57 for these configurations ) in quantities of @xmath58 . however , significant residual @xmath59 errors may remain in this simulation .",
    "an investigation of the scaling behaviour of quenched light hadron masses using a nonperturbative determination of the @xmath2 improvement coefficient  @xcite in the clover action concluded that these errors are negligible for @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "the remaining scaling violations at these @xmath16 s are estimated to be a few percent  @xcite in the quenched results . in the present study tadpole - improved clover fermions",
    "are used for the valence quarks and staggered fermions for the dynamical quarks  ( which introduce @xmath61 errors ) . since @xmath3 corresponds to roughly the same lattice spacing as that at @xmath14  ( see table  [ latt ] ) we do not expect the associated scaling violations to be larger than in the quenched case .",
    "the truncation of the nrqcd series at @xmath1 introduces an absolute error of @xmath62 .",
    "this corresponds to approximately @xmath63 errors in quantities of @xmath58 and @xmath64 errors in the coefficients of the heavy quark expansion at @xmath65 .",
    "in fact the significance of the higher order terms omitted from the action depends on the quantity considered .",
    "the additional terms to @xmath66 and the leading @xmath67 terms are : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the symmetric gauge - covariant lattice derivative and @xmath70 is a discretised version of the continuum operator @xmath71 .",
    "the first two terms , of @xmath66 , represent the spin - orbit interaction  ( s.o . ) and the darwin term , respectively .",
    "interaction only contributes to states with non - zero angular momentum and is a @xmath72 correction to the s.o .",
    "interaction arising from the light quark , which dominates  ( see the next section ) .",
    "the darwin term is a @xmath73 spin - independent shift which appears in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 states , but which does not affect spin splittings , such as the hyperfine splitting .",
    "the next order terms at @xmath74 are due to corrections to the kinetic energy and discretisation corrections and should be even less significant . of course , all the terms in @xmath75 will affect predictions through the change in the meson mass .",
    "however , for example the @xmath76 terms represent a @xmath77 correction to the meson mass , and hence , the shift in the meson mass has a less significant effect on predictions than those already mentioned .    indeed , a comparison by ishikawa et al  @xcite of the low lying @xmath4-state heavy - light spectrum derived from an nrqcd action correct to @xmath1 and that including the additional terms in equation  [ highterms ] showed the higher order terms to be insignificant . a more detailed analysis of the effect of higher order terms on the @xmath4-state spectrum has been performed by lewis and woloshyn  @xcite .",
    "these authors verified that the importance of the terms in the nrqcd action follows the expectations of naive power counting , i.e. @xmath78 , where all @xmath79 terms were included .",
    "terms of @xmath66 and @xmath79 were found to have a negligible effect on the @xmath4-state @xmath6 meson mass splittings .",
    "ishikawa et al also compared the results for the pseudoscalar and vector decay constant including tree - level terms to @xmath1 and @xmath66  ( for these quantities , corrections to the currents as well as to the action must be considered ) .",
    "the decay constants differed by approximately @xmath80 at the @xmath6 meson , and , @xmath81 is , conservatively , estimated to be the corresponding error in @xmath19 if @xmath75 and the @xmath66 current corrections are omitted .",
    "an additional uncertainty is introduced through the use of the tree - level value  ( with tadpole - improvement ) for the hyperfine coefficient , @xmath82 .",
    "tadpole improvement is expected to account for most of the renormalisation of this factor .",
    "however , an error of @xmath83 will remain ; for example this corresponds to approximately @xmath84 , for @xmath85 in the @xmath86 splitting , which is proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "the one - loop correction to @xmath82 has been calculated  @xcite and for @xmath87 , a bare quark mass close to @xmath88 for this simulation , @xmath89 , depending on the characteristic scale @xmath90 used .    for the determination of @xmath19 and @xmath21 ,",
    "the factors matching the lattice currents to the full continuum qcd currents must be calculated .",
    "morningstar and shigemitsu have computed these factors for both the axial - vector  @xcite and vector  @xcite currents .",
    "the mixing at @xmath91 among heavy - light current operators has been fully taken into account .",
    "in addition , an @xmath92 discretisation correction to the current was found and corrected for in the case of clover light fermions .",
    "this has been discussed in detail in  @xcite , and we present an outline in section  [ decaysection ] . the largest remaining perturbative error is @xmath93 .    combining the tadpole - improved clover action for light quarks with the @xmath66 nrqcd action , hein et al  @xcite found no significant scaling violations in results for the quenched @xmath6 spectrum and decay constant between @xmath14 and @xmath94 .",
    "the results from a recent quenched calculation by ishikawa et al  @xcite of @xmath19 at three @xmath16 values in the range @xmath95 supports this finding .    a further continuing uncertainty is the possibility of large finite volume effects",
    "a study by duncan et al  @xcite in the static limit in the quenched approximation found no significant finite volume effects in the results for the lowest lying s - state @xmath6 mesons  ( and in particular for @xmath19 ) for a box size as small as @xmath96  fm .",
    "finite volume effects are likely to be larger when dynamical quarks are included  @xcite . however , since for our simulation , @xmath97  fm , for a visible effect , finite volume problems would have to be very different in the dynamical case , despite the fairly heavy sea quark masses  ( @xmath98 is around the strange quark mass ) that we use .",
    "a preliminary study by the sesam collaboration  @xcite , using sea quark masses which correspond to @xmath99 , found the finite volume effects for the @xmath100 meson  ( which is bigger physically than the lowest lying @xmath4-state @xmath6 mesons ) to be small , less than @xmath101 for a lattice size similar to that used in this work .",
    "however , in the absence of a detailed investigation of finite volume effects for @xmath6 mesons at @xmath15 this remains an unknown effect .",
    "table  [ syserrors ] summarises the systematic errors expected to dominate each mass splitting and combination of decay constants . in general , our statistical errors are of a comparable size .",
    "the only significant exception is for the radial and orbital excitations of the @xmath6 meson and the @xmath7 baryon .",
    "these particles are probably squeezed on a box of extent @xmath102 , although for @xmath103 and @xmath104 our statistical errors are also large .    while within the @xmath6 system we are close to achieving our goal of controlling the main systematic errors , a major uncertainty is introduced when we convert from lattice numbers to physical predictions .",
    "in particular , this uncertainty affects predictions through the fixing of the quark masses  ( discussed below ) as well as the final conversion from lattice units to mev .",
    "ideally one would fix the lattice spacing using a quantity within the @xmath6 system .",
    "however , with the exception of the lowest lying @xmath4-states , the experimental results for the @xmath6 spectrum are still preliminary and it is unfeasible to fix @xmath17 , for example , from the @xmath105 or @xmath106 splitting  ( which have little dependence on @xmath107 ) .",
    "thus , one must consider determinations of @xmath17 from light and heavy spectroscopy ; table  [ latt ] gives some examples for these configurations .",
    "as in the discussion above for heavy - light hadrons the effect of systematic errors on the value of the lattice spacing must be considered .",
    "we computed @xmath108 using the tadpole - improved clover action and results for this quantity from quenched studies are consistent with minimal discretisation errors in this quantity for @xmath109  gev  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the @xmath110 spectrum was computed with an @xmath111 nrqcd action , and in quenched studies the spin - averaged splittings obtained using this action show no scaling violations in the same range of lattice spacings  @xcite .",
    "finite volume effects may affect @xmath108 for a box size of @xmath112  ( this is not expected to be an issue for heavy quarkonia ) .",
    "these effects are not thought to be significant for a calculation of @xmath108 with similar parameters in the quenched approximation  ( such as that detailed in table  [ latt ] )  @xcite . however , finite volume problems are expected to be larger when dynamical quarks are introduced  @xcite .",
    "naively , one expects @xmath108 to be overestimated , and hence @xmath113 underestimated if the meson is squeezed on a finite lattice .",
    "although the preliminary sesam study , mentioned above , suggests this may not be significant , finite volume dependence remains an uncertainty .",
    "table  [ latt ] indicates there is a large discrepancy between @xmath113 determined from light and heavy spectroscopy for the hemcgc configurations . in the quenched approximation ,",
    "different lattice spacings are expected from quantities dominated by different physical scales and one must choose the most relevant quantity with which to fix @xmath17 . when dynamical quarks are partially introduced some convergence in the estimates of @xmath113 is expected  ( although with @xmath114 significant residual quenching effects will probably remain ) and the choice of quantity to determine @xmath17 should be less important",
    ". however , the range in @xmath113 is comparable to that seen in the quenched approximation at @xmath14 , also detailed in the table  ( the same light quark and nrqcd actions were employed ) ; @xmath115 and @xmath116 for @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively , compared to @xmath119 from experiment .",
    "one possibility is that introducing two flavours of sea quarks with @xmath120 produces little effect on @xmath121 .",
    "alternatively , any effect of the sea quarks may be counteracted by more significant finite volume problems  ( or some other systematic error dependent on the number of sea quarks ) at @xmath15 for @xmath108 compared to @xmath117 .",
    "until this issue has been clarified , we choose the lattice spacing from @xmath108 to convert to physical units at @xmath15 and use @xmath122  gev to give a  ( conservative ) indication of the uncertainty in @xmath113 .",
    "this translates into an error in physical predictions at least as large as those already mentioned .",
    "we comment on how to compare our results for heavylight hadrons with those from quenched simulations below .",
    "to pin - point the @xmath6 and @xmath123 mesons from the range of meson masses simulated in this study we must fix the bare quark masses corresponding to the lightest quark  ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) , the strange quark and the bottom quark .",
    "the bare mass of the lightest quark is fixed in the standard way by extrapolating the pion mass to zero .",
    "as indicated above , @xmath126 is derived from the @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 mesons , and we use the difference in the results as an estimate of the uncertainty in @xmath130 . the magnitude of this error found in the @xmath131 splitting and the ratio @xmath132 is given in table  [ syserrors ] . in order to determine @xmath133 we must first correct the meson simulation energies for the removal of the mass term in the nrqcd action .",
    "as detailed in  @xcite we use the mass shift calculated from heavy quarkonia dispersion behaviour to obtain the heavy - light meson masses from the simulation energies .",
    "thus , interpolating between our results for the pseudoscalar meson until we obtain the @xmath6 meson mass , we find @xmath134 for @xmath135  gev .    in order to investigate sea quark effects we need to compare our results with similar calculations in the quenched approximation .",
    "while we believe the dominant systematic errors are under control , most of the remaining residual uncertainties are minimised if we compare with a simulation which uses a lattice with a similar lattice spacing and physical volume . from table  [ latt ]",
    "@xmath136 in the quenched approximation roughly matches @xmath24 at @xmath15 .",
    "references  @xcite and  @xcite report on nrqcd results using tadpole - improved clover light quarks at this @xmath16 , on a lattice volume of @xmath137 .",
    "a higher - order nrqcd action is employed for the heavy quarks  ( @xmath138 is included ) , however , considering the negligible effect these terms have at the @xmath6 meson mass , these quenched results are suitable for comparison .    for the quenched simulation the lattice spacing derived from light spectroscopy is considered most relevant for @xmath6 splittings and decay constants which are expected to be dominated by the ` brown muck ' .",
    "thus , we initially compare the two simulations fixing the lattice spacing from @xmath108 in both cases .",
    "the effect on the comparison of the large uncertainty in @xmath113 for @xmath15 is also considered .    within our study",
    "it is premature to attempt an extrapolation of the quenched and unquenched data to a physically relevant number of sea quark flavours .",
    "we introduce uncertainties by implementing clover light valence fermions while using staggered sea fermions .",
    "in addition , we chirally extrapolate the valence light quarks to zero light quark mass while keeping the sea quark mass fixed around the strange quark mass .",
    "thus , our simulation does not correspond to that for a light and heavy quark bound state with a sea of two flavours of physical quarks .",
    "however , inserting dynamical quarks allows the sensitivity of various quantities to these effects to be investigated .",
    "a more systematic approach to sea quark effects is reserved for later work .",
    "figure  [ spectrum1 ] presents our results for the lower lying @xmath6 meson spectrum and the @xmath7 baryon compared to experiment . at this initial stage",
    "our results are in broad agreement with experiment .",
    "the experimental results for all but the lowest states are still uncertain . in particular , there are only preliminary signals for the @xmath139 and @xmath5 states . for the latter , a signal has been found for a @xmath140 resonance  @xcite , which is probably has @xmath141 , and a @xmath142 resonance  @xcite , which is likely to be a superposition of various @xmath5 states .",
    "our result for the @xmath5 state  ( @xmath143 ) is obtained from an operator with quantum numbers @xmath144 in the @xmath145 nomenclature of quarkonia . since",
    "charge conjugation is not a symmetry in the heavy - light system the two @xmath146 , @xmath147 states mix and thus our operator has an overlap with both states .",
    "we investigated this mixing by forming a matrix of correlators with the @xmath148 operator .",
    "however , these operators were found to be degenerate at this level of statistics .",
    "in fact , we are unable to resolve any splitting between the @xmath5 states in this study .    in addition",
    ", we can compare with the theoretical expectations from heavy quark symmetry  ( hqs ) , shown in figure  [ spectrumt ]  @xcite .",
    "the picture of a heavy quark surrounded by a light quark cloud , where the heavy quark acts merely as a colour source in the heavy quark limit , predicts a gross spectrum determined by the light quark degrees of freedom ; this gives rise to meson mass splittings of @xmath58 which are independent of the heavy quark at lowest order .",
    "in particular , the large scale features of the spectrum are due to the radial  ( @xmath139 ) and orbital  ( @xmath149 ) excitation of the light quark . at the next order",
    "are the @xmath141 and @xmath150 doublets of the @xmath5 states , which are split due to the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the @xmath151 and @xmath105 splittings in figure  [ spectrum1 ] are @xmath152  mev or @xmath58 , in agreement with this naive picture .",
    "similarly , heavy - light hadrons which only differ from the @xmath6 meson in the light quark flavour , for example @xmath123 , or the number of light quarks , for example @xmath7 , will also give rise to splittings independent of @xmath107 at lowest order .    at finite @xmath107 , flavour and spin symmetry",
    "are broken by the kinetic energy of the heavy quark and the hyperfine interaction .",
    "the latter removes the degeneracy in the heavy quark spin , for example in the @xmath153 s - states and the @xmath141 and @xmath153 p - states .",
    "these hyperfine doublets are expected to be split by @xmath154 mev ; this compares well with the experimental hyperfine splitting , @xmath155  mev .",
    "these splittings vanish as @xmath156 in the static limit .",
    "our results are compared with experiment in more detail , taking into account the systematic errors , in table  [ prediction ] .",
    "if we assume , initially , @xmath157  gev is a reasonable estimate of the lattice spacing for these configurations the only significant disagreement with experiment is found in the @xmath158 splitting .",
    "finite volume effects , which are not included in the estimates of the systematic errors , may well account for the rather high value for the @xmath7 mass .",
    "for all splittings , the error from setting @xmath113 is at least as large as the statistical or other systematic errors .",
    "however , since this uncertainty leads to a positive shift in the splittings it does not lessen the disagreement with experiment found for the @xmath158 splitting",
    ". there is also less agreement for the @xmath131 and @xmath159 splittings using @xmath122  gev .    with the mass splittings calculated for a wide range of heavy quark masses , not just in the region of the @xmath6 meson",
    ", we are able to investigate violations of hqs at finite @xmath107 .",
    "the behaviour of these splittings as a function of @xmath160 is shown in figures  [ hqdep ] and  [ hqdep_cont ] , in lattice units .",
    "the @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 splittings are very weakly  ( and linearly ) dependent on @xmath165 , consistent with behaviour dominated by the light quark , with small corrections due to the kinetic energy of the heavy quark and the hyperfine interaction ; @xmath166 denotes the simulation energy of a pseudoscalar meson , while @xmath167 denotes the spin - average of the simulation energy with the corresponding vector meson .",
    "@xmath168 indicates that the light quark mass has been interpolated to that of the strange quark mass .",
    "note that by taking the spin - average the dependence of that mass on the hyperfine term is removed .",
    "similarly , the hyperfine splitting in the @xmath169 and @xmath139 states depends linearly on @xmath165 over the range of masses studied , vanishing in the static limit , as expected theoretically .    to quantify the heavy quark mass dependence we fit the mass splittings to the form : @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the pseudoscalar meson mass , and extract the coefficients @xmath172 and @xmath173 , which are expected to be of @xmath58 and @xmath174 respectively  ( with the exception of the hyperfine splittings where @xmath175 ) .",
    "in fact , the coefficients can be related to the binding energy and expectation values of the kinetic energy of the heavy quark and the hyperfine interaction in the static limit for each meson or baryon .",
    "these quantities are needed in analytical approaches such as hqet .",
    "if we define the heavy - light hadron binding energy , @xmath176 , using : @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the mass of the hadron , and expand using first order perturbation theory , @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 represent the hadron state and the binding energy , respectively , in the infinite mass limit ; @xmath182 and @xmath183 . in principle , the separation of the meson mass into the heavy quark mass and binding energy in equation  [ bind ] must be clearly defined .",
    "however , we only consider physical mass splittings , for which the differences in the definitions of @xmath176 cancel .",
    "this has the additional benefit that the @xmath1 coefficients of the mass splittings correspond to the physical difference in expectation values of the kinetic energy  ( and/or hyperfine interaction ) of the particles in the splitting .",
    "thus , we consider , for example , the @xmath151 mass splitting of the spin - average s - states , which can be expressed as @xmath184 where @xmath185 denotes the physical expectation value of the kinetic energy in the @xmath6 meson .",
    "the results are given in table  [ etab ] in physical units and compared with the theoretical expectation .    given the weak dependence of most splittings on the heavy quark mass , an estimate of the intercept and slope for some splittings can be made from the experimental results for the @xmath6 and @xmath186 spectrum and @xmath7 and @xmath187 baryons .",
    "the hyperfine splittings are strongly dependent on @xmath107 .",
    "however , the intercept is zero , and this can be used along with the splitting for the @xmath6 meson to estimate the slope .",
    "the corresponding estimates of the intercept and slope of various meson and baryon mass splittings are also shown in the table .",
    "table  [ etab ] shows that for quantities which are weakly dependent on @xmath165 , we can reliably extract @xmath172 . however , it is difficult to reliably extract the slope and an increase in statistics is required in order to provide quantitative predictions .",
    "qualitatively , the results are consistent with the theoretical predictions of only small violations of hqs , @xmath188 , around the @xmath6 meson . comparing with the estimates derived from experiment",
    "we find our value for the slope of the hyperfine splitting is low , reflecting the low value we obtain for the @xmath86 splitting .",
    "the absolute statistical error in the splitting is more or less constant with @xmath107 , while the splitting rises as the mass decreases .",
    "thus , a low value of the slope is a clearer indication than the @xmath6 hyperfine splitting itself , that our results are inconsistent with experiment .",
    "the hyperfine coefficient , @xmath82 , depends on the heavy quark mass and a determination of this coefficient for the range of masses studied here is needed to clarify the source of any remaining discrepancy with experiment , for example residual quenching effects .",
    "reasonable agreement is found between the lattice results for the @xmath162 splitting and the estimates from experiment .",
    "this is also the case for the slope of the @xmath189 splitting , while the intercept is too high  ( consistent with finite volume problems mentioned previously ) .",
    "our results for the intercepts and slopes of spectral quantities are consistent with our previous estimates using wilson light quarks detailed in reference  @xcite .",
    "an indication of sea quark effects can be found by comparing the @xmath15 results with our previous spectrum calculation in the quenched approximation at @xmath136 , detailed in reference  @xcite .",
    "the results for the splittings which have been calculated in both cases are detailed in figure  [ spectrum1 ] and table  [ pred_pev ] , where @xmath113 is fixed from @xmath108 in both cases . with the exception of the hyperfine splitting",
    ", the quenched simulation reproduces the experimental spectrum well to this level of statistical and systematic uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , comparing with the @xmath15 results , we see consistency to within @xmath191 . however , switching to @xmath122  gev for the dynamical configurations , differences of @xmath192 appear for the @xmath131 , @xmath159 and @xmath158 splittings .",

    "as discussed in section  [ decaysection ] the dependence on @xmath341 is expected to be roughly the same for all @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath342 is insensitive to the light quark mass .",
    "figure  [ decaylight ] gives the tree - level values for @xmath230 for all heavy quark masses and @xmath343 .",

    "we find the slope for the lighter two @xmath30 s  ( corresponding to @xmath347 and smaller ) are consistent with the chiral limit , @xmath348 in lattice units .",

    "note that the values of @xmath90 are also not known for this method .",
    "there are clear advantages to simulating at finite heavy quark mass with an inverse lattice spacing around @xmath365  gev .",
    "the combined @xmath18-loop corrections grow as @xmath171 tends towards the static limit  ( with the @xmath366 terms in the matching coefficients fixed to @xmath367 ) , as does the accompanying uncertainty due to the omission of higher orders in the matching coefficients .",
    "thus , for a coarser lattice spacing , i.e. with a larger value for @xmath262 , ( and indeed for the static limit ) a nonperturbative determination of the matching factors becomes essential . certainly this is required for a determination of the slope of the decay constant . for a finer lattice ,",
    "@xmath262 becomes smaller , and at some point nrqcd breaks down : the bare lattice matrix elements grow larger , i.e. increasingly higher orders in the nrqcd expansion become important , while the @xmath368 terms in the matching coefficients also become large and perturbation theory is not well controlled .",
    "the interplay between the individual @xmath296 matrix elements and their effect on the slope of the decay constant can be seen in figure  [ pertcontrib1 ] . the tree - level and 1-loop corrections to the zeroth order matrix element",

    "the @xmath1 and @xmath8 terms , @xmath300 and @xmath370 and @xmath371 , respectively , vanish in the static limit and grow as @xmath53 becomes small .",
    "the discretisation correction has very little dependence on the heavy quark mass , while the @xmath91 correction to @xmath303 decreases dramatically from the static limit , and goes through zero as @xmath53 becomes lighter .",
    "the corrections contribute with differing signs leading to some cancellation between them . towards the heavy mass limit , @xmath372 ,",

    "thus , surprisingly , at @xmath376 , the decay constant is roughly equal to the tree - level value .",
    "note , however , that in this region the 1-loop terms @xmath370 and @xmath377 are not small at around @xmath64 .    thus , the almost complete removal of any heavy quark mass dependence when the @xmath18-loop terms are included using @xmath293 , is due to the large @xmath18-loop correction in the large mass limit  ( where @xmath1 terms are small ) , @xmath378 in the static limit , and a large tree - level @xmath1 correction for the lighter meson masses  ( where the @xmath18-loop terms cancel ) , @xmath379 for @xmath380 .",

    "numerically , the difference between the results is mainly due to the extrapolation to @xmath408 in the clover case   and thus the slope of the decay constant is much larger than in the chiral limit , as discussed previously . ] , since at tree - level the decay constant does not change significantly between the two light quark actions .",
    "we compare our results with those calculated as part of the @xmath66 quenched simulation at @xmath14 already mentioned in section  [ nfspectrum ] . in reference",
    "@xcite we quote , @xmath409 for the quenched result .",
    "the errors are calculated in a similar way to those in this paper and , with the exception of the uncertainty due to fixing @xmath113 , are of a similar size .",
    "the first error corresponds to statistical errors and those errors due to extrapolation / interpolation in @xmath30 and @xmath53 .",
    "the second error indicates the uncertainty in @xmath113 calculated using @xmath157  gev and @xmath410  gev .",
    "this range represents the spread in @xmath113 derived from various light spectroscopic quantities .",
    "higher order perturbative and relativistic uncertainties are given by the third error and the fourth error is due to discretisation corrections . for @xmath20",
    "the error in fixing @xmath130 is found by fixing the strange quark mass from the @xmath128 meson  ( for the central value ) and the @xmath127 meson ; the @xmath129 meson gave the same value of @xmath130 as the @xmath127 meson .",
    "the quenched calculation includes @xmath75 in the action and the tree - level @xmath66 current corrections . since the @xmath66",
    "current corrections were calculated separately we can easily omit them in order to make a better comparison with our present @xmath1 @xmath15 results .",
    "apart from this the quenched simulation and analysis remains the same as detailed in reference  @xcite .",
    "the modified quenched results are presented in table  [ comp_pev ] .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ decayresults ] , the contributions from @xmath411 have a minimal effect on the pseudoscalar matrix elements in the region of the @xmath6 meson .",
    "thus , there should only be a very small uncertainty in the comparison between quenched and @xmath15 results due to the differing actions .",
    "in fact , since @xmath75 tends to increase @xmath19 , removing it would increase rather than decrease the sea quark effect that we see .    the comparison is made at tree - level , and at @xmath18-loop for @xmath291 and @xmath293 in table  [ comp_pev ] . in perturbation theory",
    "the effects of sea quarks appear beyond @xmath18-loop .",
    "thus , @xmath412 is likely to be very similar for the same @xmath413 values for quenched and @xmath414 . since the values of @xmath17 and hence @xmath262",
    "are closely matched for the two simulations , it is reasonable to compare at fixed @xmath412 .",
    "considering , in addition , that the quenched and unquenched simulations are very similar in method and analysis we expect the systematic errors to be similar  ( and correlated ) in both cases .",
    "thus , initially , we make a comparison considering only the statistical errors .",
    "table  [ comp_pev ] shows that @xmath19 is a quantity which is sensitive to the presence of sea quarks and that the quenched value for @xmath19 may be substantially lower than the value in full qcd .",

    "increase in @xmath19 , when two flavours of sea quarks are included .",
    "the increase is roughly the same at tree - level and at @xmath18-loop for @xmath291 and @xmath293 .",
    "if the actual value of @xmath412 for @xmath117 turns out to be higher than that for @xmath15 then the sea quark effect becomes smaller . in the reverse case",
    "the effect would be larger .",
    "alternatively , we can ignore the fact that the systematic errors between the quenched and unquenched results are probably highly correlated .",
    "combining the statistical and systematic errors in quadrature , we obtain @xmath417  mev at @xmath117 , compared to @xmath418  mev at @xmath15 ; the lattice spacing is fixed using @xmath108 in both cases , i.e. the uncertainty arising from fixing @xmath17 is ignored , and the central value is obtained from the average of the results for @xmath293 and @xmath318 . in this case , the @xmath419  mev shift in @xmath19 is a @xmath199 effect . note that , considering the uncertainty in @xmath113 for @xmath15 , using @xmath122  gev will lead to a larger sea quark effect .",
    "this increase includes any effect due to finite volume problems for the determination of @xmath113 from @xmath108 at @xmath15 . as mentioned in section  [ errors ] @xmath113 is expected to be underestimated if the @xmath100 meson is squeezed .",
    "comparing the central values for @xmath20 the increase with @xmath190 is slightly smaller , @xmath420 , but statistically more significant at between @xmath421 and @xmath422 .",
    "the error in @xmath20 due to the uncertainty in @xmath130 clouds the comparison for this quantity slightly . for the @xmath15 configurations , @xmath423 and @xmath424 give consistent values for @xmath130 , while @xmath425 gives a slightly higher value  ( see section  [ simdet ] ) .",
    "in contrast , for the quenched results the error in @xmath130 is larger , and as mentioned previously , is computed using from using @xmath426 and @xmath427 ; @xmath425 and @xmath427 give consistent results . thus ,",
    "if @xmath427 is used the quenched decay constant is increased by @xmath428  mev , while the @xmath15 value is unchanged .",
    "the difference between the two values for @xmath20 is reduced to @xmath429 or a @xmath430 effect  ( a similar decrease is found using @xmath425 ) . a detailed study of how to fix @xmath130 is needed to improve the comparison of quenched and unquenched results for @xmath20 . if the systematic errors are taken in account , @xmath431  mev at @xmath117 and @xmath432  mev for @xmath15 ; the central value is found using @xmath130 from @xmath426 , but the associated uncertainty in @xmath130 is included in the error . assuming the errors are independent , the @xmath433  mev shift corresponds to @xmath199 .",
    "the effect of sea quarks in the decay constants have also been studied by the milc collaboration  @xcite .",
    "@xmath19 was found to increase by @xmath434 from the quenched to the @xmath15 result .",
    "the wilson action was employed for the heavy and light quark at several @xmath16 values at both @xmath117 and @xmath118 . extrapolating the results to the continuum limit these authors find @xmath435  mev .",
    "clearly systematic errors  ( of which discretisation errors are the dominant source ) are as large an effect as quenching .",
    "in this situation the size of the sea quark effects is very sensitive to the interpolation of the @xmath117 results to a lattice spacing which coincides with that found at @xmath15 to enable a comparison .",
    "however , until the systematic errors are explored thoroughly at @xmath15 , the difference between our results and those from the milc collaboration are not significant .",
    "since the matching factors have been calculated over a wide range of @xmath171 , we can also investigate the mass dependence of the sea quark effects .",
    "figure  [ pertnf ] presents the results for tree - level and @xmath18-loop for two values of @xmath412 .",
    "the roughly constant shift between @xmath117 and @xmath15 for the whole range of meson masses from @xmath436 to @xmath55 indicates the sea quark effects are associated with the light quark rather than dependent on the heavy quark .",
    "we also compare the results for the ratio @xmath321 .",
    "the large sea quark effects we see in @xmath20 and @xmath19 individually appear to cancel in the ratio .",
    "there is only a @xmath437 or @xmath438 decrease in @xmath321 when two flavours of sea quarks are introduced . if @xmath130 from @xmath427 is used the results are consistent to within less than @xmath439 .",
    "we presented comprehensive results for the spectrum and decay constants of the @xmath6 meson including the effects of two flavours of dynamical quarks .",
    "in addition , an investigation of the effects of sea quarks through a comparison with quenched simulations was performed . at present ,",
    "we do not attempt to extrapolate in @xmath190 but look for initial indications of quenching effects .    results , summarised in table  [ prediction ] , were presented for the lower lying @xmath4 and @xmath5 meson states and the @xmath7 baryon . with the exception of the @xmath440 splitting ,",
    "the estimates of the systematic errors for all mass splittings were comparable to or less than the statistical errors .",
    "the @xmath158 splitting represented the only significant disagreement with experiment .",
    "this discrepancy is probably due to finite volume effects .",
    "a detailed analysis of the heavy quark mass dependence of physical spectral mass splittings was performed .",
    "we found the behaviour with @xmath171 to fulfill the naive expectation : @xmath58 quantities are weakly dependent on @xmath171 , while spin - dependent splittings vanish as @xmath156 in the large mass limit .",
    "estimates of the slope and intercept of these quantities were extracted and agreement was found with the theoretical expectation from hqs .",
    "a comparison was also made with experiment .",
    "this showed that the slope for the hyperfine splitting was too low in our simulation .",
    "residual quenching effects are a possible explanation for this discrepancy .",
    "however , we have underestimated the splitting through the use of the tree - level value of the coefficient of the hyperfine term in our simulation  ( this underestimate is not significant within statistics at the @xmath6 meson ) .",
    "@xmath82 depends on @xmath171 and improved estimates of this coefficient must be included for all @xmath53 before the origin of the discrepancy is clear .",
    "we presented a comparison of our results with a similar quenched calculation at @xmath14 using a @xmath66 action detailed in  @xcite . a comparison with a higher order nrqcd action is possible as the additional terms in the action do not significantly affect the mass splittings considered .",
    "the quenched results reproduce the experimental spectrum well to the present level of accuracy , and there is no significant difference between the quenched and @xmath15 results .",
    "in addition , results were presented for the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath441 decay constants at tree - level and fully consistent to 1-loop in perturbation theory .",
    "we found the combined @xmath18-loop corrections are moderate and reduce the tree - level value of @xmath19 by @xmath442 depending on @xmath90 .",
    "our predictions for the @xmath296 and @xmath326 decay constants are @xmath443 adding the statistical and systematic errors in quadrature  ( errors @xmath444 ) , there is a combined uncertainty of @xmath312 in the decay constants .",
    "this indicates a determination of @xmath19 to around @xmath64 is possible using an @xmath1 nrqcd action with clover light fermions .",
    "however , first of all the error due to the uncertainty in the lattice spacing  ( @xmath336 ) must be significantly reduced .",
    "conversely , for @xmath321 and @xmath337 most systematic errors cancel , and these quantities can be more easily determined accurately .",
    "we find @xmath445    we presented a detailed study of the heavy quark mass dependence of the decay constants .",
    "we find the steep dependence of the tree - level @xmath296 decay constant , for which @xmath446  gev , is dramatically reduced when the @xmath18-loop terms are included ; @xmath447  gev depending on @xmath90 .",
    "we show how this occurs through the cancellation between the various @xmath18-loop and tree - level current corrections as the individual terms vary with the heavy quark mass .",
    "we have shown that simulating directly at the @xmath6 with @xmath113 such that @xmath262 is in the region of @xmath118 is advantageous .",
    "in particular , this value of @xmath53 sits in the window between large perturbative corrections for larger @xmath53 and significant contributions from higher orders in nrqcd for smaller @xmath53 .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath18-loop matching factors should be checked by a nonperturbative determination ; this is essential for a determination of the slope .",
    "similarly , for the smaller meson masses studied here , higher orders in the nrqcd expansion should be considered .",
    "however , there are no indications that nrqcd is breaking down for the range of masses studied .    in addition",
    ", we present a tree - level analysis of the origin of the slope @xmath342 , and separate the contributions from the hyperfine and kinetic energy terms in the nrqcd action and the tree - level current correction .",
    "we find @xmath448  gev dominates @xmath342 , while the slope of the ratio @xmath404 , related to @xmath400 and @xmath284 is @xmath58 , consistent with naive expectation from hqs .",
    "however , considering the results for the @xmath18-loop corrections discussed previously ( which are not suitable for a study of hqs ) , @xmath399 is likely to be reduced significantly by renormalisation and @xmath18-loop corrections to @xmath284 are also likely to be large",
    ".    with this extensive analysis of the decay constants we are able to perform a detailed comparison of our results with those from the @xmath66 quenched simulation at @xmath136 .",
    "we find that @xmath19 appears to be considerably larger at @xmath15 compared to that at @xmath117 .",
    "clearly , @xmath19 is a quantity which is sensitive to internal quark loops , and further work is needed to investigate the dependence of the decay constant on the mass and the number of flavours of sea quarks .",
