    "it is well - known that a hamiltonian system on a symplectic manifold @xmath5 of dimension @xmath6 is ( liouville ) completely integrable if there exist @xmath7 first integrals that pairwise commute and which are functionally independent in a dense open subset @xmath8 of @xmath5 .",
    "in such a case , @xmath8 admits a lagrangian foliation and the solutions of the hamiltonian dynamics live in the leaves of this foliation ( see @xcite ) . the previous notion may be extended , in a natural way , for the more general case when the phase space @xmath5 is a poisson manifold @xmath9 , not necessarily symplectic ( for more details , see @xcite ) . following this approach , a dynamical system on a manifold @xmath9",
    "is said to be bi - hamiltonian if admits two hamiltonian descriptions with respect to two compatible poisson structures on @xmath9 .",
    "bi - hamiltonian and completely integrable hamiltonian systems are closely related since , under certain conditions , a bi - hamiltonian system is completely integrable ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "we also recall that for a multiplicative poisson structure on a lie group @xmath10 , the multiplication is a poisson epimorphism . in these conditions ,",
    "the dual space @xmath11 of the lie algebra @xmath12 of @xmath10 admits a lie algebra structure in such a way that the couple @xmath13 is a lie bialgebra .",
    "in fact , the lie algebra structure on @xmath11 is defined by the dual map of an adjoint @xmath14-cocycle on @xmath12 with values in @xmath15 .",
    "conversely , an adjoint @xmath14-cocycle on a lie algebra @xmath12 with values in @xmath15 whose dual map satisfies the jacobi identity , induces a unique multiplicative poisson structure on a connected simply connected lie group with lie algebra @xmath12 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "lie groups which are endowed with multiplicative poisson structures are called poisson - lie groups and lie - poisson structures on the dual space of a lie algebra @xmath12 are examples of abelian poisson - lie groups ( for more details see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "poisson - lie groups are instances of poisson coalgebras for which the comultiplication map is given by the group law , and the quantization of the former are the so - called quantum groups , which are the underlying symmetries of many relevant quantum integrable models ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) .    as it was shown in  @xcite , poisson coalgebras can be systematically used in order to construct completely integrable hamiltonian systems with an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , under this approach , deformations of poisson coalgebras provide integrable deformations of the previous systems , and all constants of the motion can be explicitly obtained . since then , this approach has been extensively used in order to construct different types of finite - dimensional integrable systems ( see  @xcite and references therein ) and several closely related constructions relying on the modification of the underlying poisson coalgebra symmmetry have been also proposed  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the generalization of the poisson coalgebra approach to bi - hamiltonian systems was still lacking , and the aim of this paper is to fill this gap by presenting a systematic approach for the construction of integrable deformations of bi - hamiltonian systems , which will be based on the theory of multiplicative poisson structures on lie groups .    to achieve this goal , we will firstly need an appropriate geometric interpretation of the results recently presented in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , from a lie - poisson completely integrable hamiltonian system defined on the dual space @xmath11 of a lie algebra @xmath12 and in the presence of an arbitrary uni - parametric family @xmath16 of adjoint @xmath14-cocycles whose dual maps satisfy the jacobi identity , we will show that a hamiltonian deformation of the initial system can be constructed on a connected and simply connected lie group with lie algebra @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath18 approaches to zero , one recovers the initial system on @xmath11 and , under certain conditions , the deformed system also is completely integrable .",
    "now , using that the multiplication in @xmath1 is associative and a poisson epimorphism , one may obtain new hamiltonian systems with more degrees of freedom on @xmath19 copies of @xmath1 , by coupling of the integrable hamiltonian deformation in @xmath1 .",
    "we will show that , by construction , these systems admit reduction , via the multiplication , to the deformed system in @xmath1 . moreover , under certain conditions , they also are completely integrable .    secondly , if we want to generalize the previous construction when the initial completely integrable hamiltonian system is bi - hamiltonian with respect to two compatible lie - poisson structures @xmath20 and @xmath21 on @xmath0 , this implies that we have to deal with two compatible lie algebra structures @xmath22_0 $ ] and @xmath22_1 $ ] on @xmath0 which induce the two compatible poisson structures @xmath20 and @xmath21 . as we will show in this paper , the following important considerations and findings arise as a consequence of the bi - hamiltonian approach :    * in order to stay within the category of bi - hamiltonian systems , we will have to impose that the first integrable deformation of the initial system to be bi - hamiltonian with respect to two compatible multiplicative poisson structures @xmath23 and @xmath24 on the _ same _ lie group @xmath1 .",
    "so , we should be able to find a common uni - parametric family of adjoint @xmath14-cocycles @xmath16 for the lie algebra structures @xmath22_0 $ ] and @xmath25_1 $ ] .",
    "* when comparing with the prescriptions given by the generic poisson coalgebra method used in  @xcite , now we have more constraints in choosing the two hamiltonian functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the bi - hamiltonian system on @xmath28 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath26 and @xmath27 must be commuting functions for the poisson structures @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this , in some cases , fixes uniquely the definition of the hamiltonians @xmath26 and @xmath27 . *",
    "the dynamics of the ( completely integrable ) hamiltonian systems @xmath29 and @xmath30 on @xmath1 coincide . however , the coupling , on one hand , of the system @xmath31 on @xmath32 and the coupling , on the other hand , of the system @xmath33 on @xmath32 can be used to produce two completely integrable hamiltonian systems on the lie group @xmath4 which have not , in general , the same dynamics . in other words ,",
    "the method does not provide , in general , a bi - hamiltonian system on the phase space @xmath4 .",
    "* nevertheless , the two completely integrable hamiltonian systems on @xmath4 admit reduction , via the multiplication , to the deformed bi - hamiltonian system on @xmath1 .",
    "so , for this reason , we can say that the hamiltonian systems on @xmath4 are ` quasi - bi - hamiltonian ' .",
    "moreover , as in the general method and by using the associativity of the multiplication in @xmath1 , one may extend this construction in order to obtain two multiplicative completely integrable hamiltonian systems on @xmath19 copies of @xmath1 , with @xmath34 . by construction , these systems admit reduction ( via the multiplication ) to the deformed bi - hamiltonian system on @xmath1 and will preserve for any @xmath19 its ` quasi - bi - hamiltonian '  nature .",
    "* the method here presented is fully constructive and it could be applied to any lie - poisson completely integrable bi - hamiltonian system such that both lie algebra structures @xmath22_0 $ ] and @xmath25_1 $ ] have a common 1-cocycle . indeed , if this cocycle is found to be multiparametric , then we would obtain a multiparametric integrable deformation of the initial bi - hamiltonian system .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ bi - ha - sy - po - lie - gr ]",
    ", we will review some definitions and basic results on poisson structures , poisson - lie groups and poisson bi - hamiltonian systems . in section 3",
    ", we will present the systematic method to obtain integrable deformations of lie - poisson bi - hamiltonian systems . for the sake of clarity , we will exemplify the method to the particular case when our initial dynamical system is a specific lie - poisson completely integrable bi - hamiltonian system on @xmath35 .",
    "our motivation for considering this system lies in the fact that its restriction to a submanifold of codimension @xmath14 is just an integrable limit of the well - known lorenz dynamical system ( see @xcite ) . in section 4",
    "we will face the problem of the construction of the two completely integrable quasi - bi - hamiltonian systems on @xmath36 , which will admit a reduction to the bi - hamiltonian systems on @xmath0 that have been presented in the previous section .",
    "the deformed counterpart of this construction leading to coupled systems on @xmath4 is presented in section 5 . in order to show the fully constructive nature of the approach here introduced , in section 6 we apply it to another relevant lie - poisson completely integrable bi - hamiltonian system : an euler top on @xmath37 .",
    "finally , a concluding section closes the paper .",
    "in this section , we will review some definitions an basic results on poisson - lie groups and bi - hamiltonian systems on poisson manifolds ( for more details , see @xcite ) .",

    "this is equivalent to defining a lie algebra structure on @xmath40 , whose bracket @xmath41 is called the poisson bracket . the relation between the two definitions",
    "is given by the formula : @xmath42 a poisson structure @xmath38 on @xmath5 determines in a natural way a vector bundle morphism @xmath43 from the cotangent bundle @xmath44 of @xmath5 to the tangent bundle @xmath45 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath46 the corresponding morphism between the space @xmath47 of @xmath14-forms on @xmath5 and the space @xmath48 of vector fields .",
    "the rank of the poisson structure at the point @xmath49 is just the rank of the linear map @xmath50 .",
