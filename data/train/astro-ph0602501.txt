    "the majority of recycled pulsars are in low mass binary pulsar ( lmbp ) systems , consisting of a neutron star and a low - mass white dwarf .",
    "the lmbps are widely considered to be descendants of the low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "the progenitors are thus a massive star primary ( which gives rise to the neutron star ) and a low mass ( @xmath1 ) secondary . in contrast ,",
    "double neutron star binaries , exemplified by psr  b1913 + 16 , descend from binaries in which both the primary and secondary are massive stars , each forming a neutron star .    over the past few years , astronomers have come to appreciate the existence of another class of binary pulsars , the so - called intermediate mass binary pulsars ( imbps ) with massive c - o or o - ne - mg white dwarf companions . as suggested by their name , impbs are thought to descend from binary star systems with a massive primary and a secondary which is intermediate in mass .",
    "first , the primary becomes a neutron star through a supernova explosion .",
    "later , the secondary evolves into a massive white dwarf , transferring matter to and recycling the pulsar in the process @xcite . as in lmbp systems ,",
    "tidal damping circularizes the orbit because the supernova occurs before the companion becomes a compact object .",
    "16 candidate imbp systems are currently known .",
    "not all pulsars with massive white dwarf companions share this evolutionary path",
    ". psr  b2303 + 46 @xcite and psr  j1141@xmath06545 @xcite have companions with masses similar to the imbp systems ; however , these slowly - rotating pulsars appear to be unrecycled and their orbits are eccentric . in systems such as these it is thought that neither the primary nor the secondary was initially massive enough to form a neutron star .",
    "as the primary evolved into a massive white dwarf it transferred matter to the secondary , thereby making the secondary massive enough to eventually become a neutron star . here again the final outcome is a massive white dwarf and a neutron star , but because the supernova occurs after the primary has become a white dwarf the orbit remains eccentric and the neutron star is not recycled @xcite .",
    "though only two such systems are known , they may exist in numbers greater than neutron star binary systems @xcite .",
    "the detection of the white dwarf companion via optical observations can help clarify this interesting evolutionary path @xcite .",
    "apart from these tests of binary evolution , these systems may offer us new insights into the physics of how neutron stars are spun up by accretion .",
    "it is clear that the mass transfer of the recycling process results in a decreased magnetic field , as well as an increased rotation rate for the neutron star .",
    "the spin period at the end of the spin - up phase , @xmath2 , is a critical input to pulsar recycling models",
    ". a comparison of the white dwarf age from cooling models with the pulsar spin - down age ( which assumes that @xmath2 is much smaller than the current spin period ) can , in principle , allow the determination of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we have obtained optical observations of fields containing six imbp systems discovered in recent radio pulsar surveys with the parkes radio telescope ( fig . 1 ; tab . 1 ; camilo et al . , 2001 ; edwards & bailes , 2001a ; kaspi et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "we observed psr  j1141@xmath06545 , psr  j1157@xmath05112 , psr  j1435@xmath06100 , psr  j1528@xmath03146 , psr  j1454@xmath05846 , and psr  j1757@xmath05322 in @xmath3 band on the nights of 6  8 august 2002 with the the magellan instant camera ( magic ) on the 6.5 m baade telescope at magellan observatory .",
    "seeing was generally good , but some targets were observed at high airmass , giving a broader point spread function .",
    "conditions were photometric on 6 and 8 august , but there were clouds present on 7 august .",
    "each of our six targets was observed for two 10-minute exposures on one of the photometric nights except for psr  j1528@xmath03146 .",
    "these data were reduced following standard practices ( bias subtraction , flat fielding with dome flats ) , photometrically calibrated with observations of the stetson standard star l112 - 805 , and astrometrically calibrated using the usno b-1.0 catalog .",
    "the astrometric uncertainty in all observations presented here is dominated by the tie between the usno - b1.0 system and the international celestial reference frame ( @xmath4 in each coordinate ) .    on the night of 4 june 2003 , we observed psr  j1528@xmath03146 once again with magic .",
    "conditions were not photometric , but better than on our previous attempt .",
    "we obtained 2 exposures of 5 minutes each in @xmath3 and 2 exposures of 10 minutes each in @xmath5 , reduced in the standard manner as before .",
    "a rough photometric calibration was obtained using stars from the usno b-1.0 catalog , which also provided the astrometric calibration .",
    "table [ tab : obs ] gives the relevant parameters of the best imaging observations in each band for each target .",
    "for each image , a model point spread function was constructed based on several stars in the field using the daophot package in iraf .",
    "limiting magnitudes were determined by placing a number of artificial stars of a given magnitude in the field and measuring their magnitudes with aperture photometry .",
    "this process was repeated to find the input artificial star magnitude that resulted in a standard deviation of @xmath6 in the measured magnitude , corresponding to a 3@xmath7 detection .",
    "the second attempt at imaging the psr  j1528@xmath03146 field revealed a faint object in the @xmath3 band image at @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and in the @xmath5 band image at @xmath10 , @xmath11 , consistent with the pulsar timing position .",
    "this potential counterpart is faint ; we estimate @xmath12 and @xmath13 , but this photometry is somewhat uncertain due to calibration with the usno b-1.0 photographic magnitudes .",
    "this object is blue relative to most other stars in the field .",
    "our observation of psr  j1757@xmath05322 showed a possible object at the radio pulsar s timing position , but it was difficult to see in the glare of a brighter star .",
    "subtraction of the brighter star from the image using the daophot substar task reveals a faint object with @xmath14 at @xmath15 , @xmath16 , consistent with the pulsar timing position .",
    "we subsequently obtained a near - ir image of the field with panic on the 6.5 m clay telescope at magellan observatory on 18 april 2003 , observing for a total of 72 minutes in @xmath17 band .",
    "we subtracted dark frames , then produced a sky frame for subtraction by taking a sliding box - car window of 4 exposures on either side of a reference exposure .",
    "we then added the exposures together , identified all the stars , and produced masks for the stars that were used to improve the sky frames in a second round of sky subtraction .",
    "astrometry was again provided by the usno b-1.0 catalog , and photometric calibration by comparison with several 2mass stars in the field .",
    "there is no object present at the pulsar s position to the detection limit of the image , @xmath18 .",
    "the implied limit on the color corresponds to a main sequence spectral type of @xmath19m4 or earlier , and is thus consistent with a white dwarf .",
    "several of these fields are rather crowded ; this was especially problematic in the case of psr  j1435@xmath06100 , whose position overlaps with three blended objects in our image . on the night of 6 june 2003",
    ", we obtained a spectrum of the bright object near the pulsar position with the ldss2 on the clay telescope , and determined that it is a reddened f - type main sequence star and thus not associated with the pulsar .",
    "we used the daophot allstar task to subtract stars near the positions of psr  j1157@xmath05112 and psr  j1435@xmath06100 , eliminating the possibility of fainter counterparts hidden by the nearby brighter objects in these cases .",
    "we detected optical counterparts for two out of the six imbp systems we studied , psr  j1528@xmath03146 and psr  j1757@xmath05322 . from table",
    "[ tab : targets ] , one sees that these are the two nearest targets .",
    "thus , it is quite possible that deeper observations would reveal the counterparts in the remaining binaries as well .    in figure",
    "[ fig : coolingcurve ] , we show cooling curves for hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs with masses from 0.5@xmath20 to 1.2@xmath20 , along with the observationally - inferred absolute @xmath3 magnitudes of massive white dwarf pulsar companions versus the spin - down ages of their pulsars .",
    "the absolute magnitudes have large uncertainties which are difficult to quantify because the only constraint on the pulsar distances is based on dispersion measure and a model of the galactic electron distribution @xcite ; however , this exercise is still instructive .",
    "we note that in all cases where optical observations failed to detect an imbp counterpart , the predicted magnitude is fainter than the observation s detection threshold .",
    "as previously mentioned , it is thought that the companion stars in the psr  j1141@xmath06545 and psr  b2303 + 46 systems must have been fully evolved by the time the pulsars formed .",
    "therefore , in these systems , the pulsar age does not constrain the white dwarf age and the failure to detect the psr  j1141@xmath06545 companion is not troubling .",
    "the detected optical counterpart of psr  b2303 + 46 @xcite is significantly fainter than predicted by the cooling model based on the pulsar s spin - down age .",
    "in addition to the expectation that the white dwarf is older than the pulsar , this object has the largest @xmath21-distance from the galactic plane in this sample ; it is above much of the ionized gas in the galactic disk , so the dispersion measure - based distance estimate could be significantly smaller than the true distance .    in all of the other systems , the neutron star formed first and the pulsar s spin - down age",
    "should , in principle , correspond to the time since the end of the companion s evolution .",
    "the other five detected objects are all brighter than predicted by the cooling curves if they are as old as their pulsars characteristic ages .",
    "although there is a large uncertainty associated with the absolute magnitude of each object , as a group , they suggest that the standard spin - down model for pulsars may in fact significantly overestimate the pulsar age in these cases , possibly because @xmath2 was not much smaller than the current spin period .",
