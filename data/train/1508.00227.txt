    "in the recent times , we have observed the renaissance in the nucleon structure studies through the drell - yan type processes in the existing ( fermilab , relativistic heavy ion collider , see @xcite ) and future ( j - parc , nica ) experiments .",
    "one of the most interesting subjects of such experimental studies in this direction is the so - called single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) which is expressed with the help of the hadron tensor , see for instance @xcite or @xcite .    lately , we have reconsidered @xcite this process in the contour gauge .",
    "we have found that there is a contribution from the _ non - standard _ diagram which produces the imaginary phase required to have the ssa .",
    "this additional contribution leads to an extra factor of @xmath2 for the asymmetry .",
    "this conclusion was supported by analysis of the qed gauge invariance of the hadron tensor .    in comparison , the analysis presented in @xcite which uses the axial and feynman gauges does not support the latter conclusion .",
    "for this reason , we perform here the detailed analysis of hadron tensor in the feynman gauge with the particular emphasis on the qed gauge invariance .",
    "we find that the qed gauge invariance can be maintained only by taking into account the non - standard diagram .",
    "moreover , the results in the feynman and contour gauges coincide if the gluon poles in the correlators @xmath0 are absent .",
    "this is in agreement with the relation between gluon poles and the sivers function which corresponds to the `` leading twist '' dirac matrix @xmath3 .",
    "we confirm this important property by comparing the light - cone dynamics for different correlators .    as a result",
    ", we derive the qed gauge invariant hadron tensor which completely coincides with the expression obtained within the light - cone contour gauge for gluons , see @xcite .",
    "we study the hadron tensor which contributes to the single spin ( left - right ) asymmetry measured in the drell - yan process with the transversely polarized nucleon ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - dy ] ) : @xmath4 here , the virtual photon producing the lepton pair ( @xmath5 ) has a large mass squared ( @xmath6 ) while the transverse momenta are small and integrated out .",
    "the left - right asymmetry means that the transverse momenta of the leptons are correlated with the direction @xmath7 where @xmath8 implies the transverse polarization vector of the nucleon while @xmath9 is a beam direction @xcite .",
    "since we perform our calculations within a _ collinear _ factorization , it is convenient to fix the dominant light - cone directions as @xmath10 so , the hadron momenta @xmath11 and @xmath12 have the plus and minus dominant light - cone components , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the quark and gluon momenta @xmath13 and @xmath14 lie along the plus direction while the antiquark momentum @xmath15  along the minus direction .",
    "the photon momentum reads ( see fig .",

    "@xcite ) : @xmath75 one can conclude that , in the case of the substantial transverse component of the momentum , there are no sources for the gluon poles at @xmath76 . as a result , the function @xmath57 has no gluon poles and , due to t - invariance @xcite ( @xmath77 ) , obeys @xmath78 .    on the other hand , if we have @xmath3 in the correlator ( see eqn .",

    "the transverse derivative of sivers function resulting from taking its moments may act on both integrand and boundary value .",
    "our result suggests that only the action on the boundary value related to @xmath52 should produce ssa .",
