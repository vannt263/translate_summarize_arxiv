    "the recent burst of work around the idea of networks can be explained by the importance of this concept in a vast range of fields , which includes both the structural features and the functional properties of networks @xcite . in particular , we are interested in random walks taking place on networks , such as regular @xcite , random and complex networks @xcite , and more recently temporal @xcite , multiplex @xcite , and interconnected networks @xcite .",
    "random walks are useful to analyze problems of searching and navigability on networks , with applications to many different fields , such as the propagation of epidemics , traffic flow , and rumor and information spreading @xcite ; for a recent survey , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in a recent paper , the usual navigation strategy of transitions to nearest neighbors",
    "is generalized by allowing long - range navigation on complex networks using lvy random walks @xcite .",
    "this generalization allows transitions not only to nearest neighbors but to second- , third- or @xmath0-nearest neighbors .",
    "this new strategy was inspired by the study of lvy flights , where the lengths of random displacements obey asymptotically a power - law probability distribution @xcite .",
    "these lvy flights generate anomalous diffusion @xcite and have been used as searching and navigation strategies by animals @xcite and also in human mobility and behavior @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that one can study anomalous diffusion , and in particular lvy flights , using a fractional calculus approach @xcite .",
    "likewise , we introduce in this paper a fractional approach applied directly to the dynamics on networks to address the problem of anomalous diffusion and long - range navigation .",

    "using this long - range dynamics one can contact directly long - distance nodes without the intervention of intermediate nodes and without altering the topology of the network.,scaledwidth=36.0% ]    this generalized long - range navigation can consider some common situations in real networks .",
    "for instance , in social networks one can use the knowledge of the network beyond our first direct contacts or acquaintances .",
    "currently , using social networks sites , one can identify the friends of your acquaintances ( second - nearest neighbors ) or the friends of the friends of your acquaintances ( third - nearest neighbors ) and so forth to search for information , a job , an expert opinion , etc . in this fashion , one can contact people two or three degrees away of your friend directly , without the intervention of your friend .",
    "this situation , which we all use almost on a daily basis , corresponds to a long - range navigation on a network : a social network in this case .",

    "long - range fractional dynamics on networks one can contact directly long - distance nodes without the intervention of intermediate nodes and without altering the topology of the network .",
    "we start with an overview of the formalism associated with diffusion processes and normal random walks on networks .",
    "then , we extend the formalism to the case of fractional diffusion on networks and obtain a random walker defined by a transition probability matrix that allows a long - range dynamics . we deduce the stationary probability distribution of this process and , in order to study the efficiency of the random walker , we calculate the average return probability to a node and the average global time associated to the capacity to explore the network .",
    "we consider undirected connected networks with @xmath5 nodes , described by the adjacency matrix @xmath6 with elements @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 ) if there is a link between node @xmath1 and node @xmath2 , and @xmath9 otherwise .",
