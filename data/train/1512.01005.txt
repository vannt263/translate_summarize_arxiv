    "neurons are cells with long and thin ( @xmath0 m in diameter ) quasi one - dimensional processes called neurites , a term which comprises the axon which emits electric signals and dendrites which are generally shorter and receive signals .",
    "these processes emerge from the cell body ( the _ soma _ ) and , during embryonic development or regeneration after a trauma , are able to crawl over large distances to reach targets from other neurons thus forming a complex nervous network essential for both perception and motion .",
    "understanding how neurites can establish these long distance connections is a problem which was pioneered more then a century ago @xcite and is of paramount therapeutic importance .",
    "for instance , injuries of the spinal cord are often characterised by an irreversible and debilitating loss of motor and sensory functions of the lower body ( paraplegia , tetraplegia ) because disrupted neurites can not overcome the inflammation and are incapable to initiate extensions that would rebuilt the broken connections @xcite .",
    "the cytoskeleton of neurites is the mechanical scaffold that maintains their morphology and motility @xcite .",
    "extrinsic and intrinsic guidance clues may be viewed as agents that influence the physical state of the cytoskeleton via biochemical pathways @xcite .",
    "for example , the concentration of calcium is known to influence the rho pathway which in turn modulates the neurite contractility and can lead to a reversible collapse that shortens the axon @xcite .    the neuronal cytoskeleton ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive review and fig .",
    "[ fig : axon_scheme ] for a simplified scheme ) is a meshwork of three main types of biological polymers : f - actin , microtubules , and neurofilaments which all contribute mechanically @xcite .",
    "while neurofilaments are passive and apolar , both f - actin and microtubules are capable to polymerise at one end ( addition of g - actin and tubulin subunits , respectively ) and depolymerise at the other ( by removal of subunits ) with potentially low ( @xmath1 min ) turnover duration",
    ". they can also both be cross - linked by molecular motors ( myosin ii for f - actin , dynein or kinesin for microtubules ) that are able to exert active stresses inside the meshwork @xcite . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we define two different compartments of the neurite where the cytoskeleton is organised in a different way : the _ kinetoplasm _ , or growth cone ( gc ) , at the proximal end of the neurite and the _ axoplasm _ which connects the gc to the soma . the axoplasm contains a core array of para - axial microtubules connected by passive cross - linkers ( map : microtubules associated proteins ) that generate a network with a quasi - lattice structure @xcite .",
    "these microtubules are highly stable ( turnover duration of hours ) possibly due to the presence of maps . in the axoplasm , f - actin is mostly organised into a cortical mesh around the microtubule s inner core and the presence of myosin ii motors in this cortex leads to the presence of contractile stresses @xcite .",
    "these two meshworks are physically connected by different types of special proteins ( such as + tip , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) which mediate force transmission between them . in continuity with this cortex ,",
    "the gc is almost free of microtubules , apart from those engaging into filopodia while f - actin is organised in a lamellipodium similar to the ones found in cells specialised in crawling ( such as keratocytes @xcite ) .",
    "filaments polymerising at the leading edge ( the _ p - domain _ ) protrude the membrane and are then advected backward by a retrograde flow powered by myosin ii motors that concentrate at the trailing edge of the gc ( the _ t - domain _ ) @xcite .",
    "actin then accumulates into thick bundles in the t - domain that constitutes the main obstacle preventing microtubules from entering the gc .",
    "the cytoskeleton is connected to the external substrate / cellular matrix by special proteins specialised in adhesion such as integrins and cadherins @xcite .",
    "schematic representation of the cytoskeleton of a neurite extending from the soma . adapted from ref .",
    "colors online.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "numerous authors have proposed physical models to explain how the neurite cytoskeleton drives its motility @xcite .",
    "these models can be divided into two main classes depending on whether they imply that the gc pulls the trailing axoplasm thanks to f - actin polymerisation pushing the membrane in the p - domain @xcite and myosin ii contractility pulling from the t - domain @xcite , or whether it is rather microtubules which , from the axoplasm , polymerise against the t - domain and propel the gc @xcite , or both @xcite . as the rate of polymerisation of microtubules depends on the force applied at their tip @xcite ,",
    "both effects have been considered in a single simple model @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the physical forces arising from the f - actin or the microtubule meshworks are important since drug treatments lowering myosin ii contractility ( blebbistatin ) , preventing actin polymerisation ( cytochalasin b ) , depolymerisating microtubules ( nocodazole ) or on the contrary stabilising them ( taxol ) each influence the tip velocity of a crawling neurite in a concentration dependent manner @xcite .",
    "interestingly , different levels of cytochalasin b can lead to either an increase @xcite ( high level ) or a decrease @xcite ( low level ) of the speed .",
    "this dependence suggests an antagonistic role of the acto - myosin meshwork in the propulsion .",
    "mechanical models require a rheological characterisation of the axoplasm and the gc .",
    "the axoplasm has been described as a burgers viscoelastic material based on its fast elastic response ( seconds to minutes ) to a force applied laterally or at the tip @xcite while it elongates at a constant rate on longer time scales ( a few hours ) in response to a constant high force @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , experiments tracking the mitochondria docked on the microtubule array have shown that , close to the t - domain , this network flows forward with a velocity comparable to the velocity of the neurite .",
    "away from the t - domain towards the soma , the velocity decays exponentially , suggesting a fluid - like behaviour of the neurite .",
    "however , if the applied force is not large enough , the neurite may undergo a finite deformation instead of acquiring a finite velocity @xcite and both rheological models of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite indicate a long term stiffness of the neurite two orders of magnitude smaller than the short time one .",
    "furthermore , the loading rate is also known to play an important role in the possible action potential impairment of the axon or in the transport properties alteration resulting from a loss of connectivity of the microtubules network @xcite .",
    "dynamic loading is not studied in this article and the loading is assumed to be quasi - static .",
    "axoplasm active growth and contractility have been proposed as the potential drivers for retraction or elongation of the neurite in presence of an applied force @xcite , and contractility is explicitly incorporated as a force opposing elongation in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the gc has been characterised as a maxwell viscoelastic fluid with a relaxation time of a few seconds and an active contractile pre - stress stemming from the motor activity at the rear of the cone @xcite .",
    "the f - actin polymerisation driven formation of filopodia extension and retraction has been physically described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we follow the suggestion of ref .",
    "@xcite that the theory of active gel may be used to unify these aforementioned models in order to obtain a global picture of neurite motility .",
    "our one - dimensional model is based on the particular geometry of the neurite cytoskeleton and fundamental balance laws .",
    "an analysis of its solutions reveals that , depending on the neurite passive and active rheology , the neurite can collapse to the soma , remain static , or grow at finite velocity .",
    "the interchangeability of these three states is consistent with experiments that modify the state of the cytoskeleton and its substrate adhesivity with drugs .",
    "in particular , we recover within a common framework the following general trends emerging from different sets of experiments probing the mechanical and structural environment of growing neurites :    * * growth under axial force : * as mentioned above and already observed 30 years ago @xcite , a steady axial force applied by a cantilever at the proximal tip of a neurite elongates it @xcite .",
    "this elongation is elastic if the force is below a certain threshold . above that threshold",
    ", the neurite grows with finite velocity @xcite . *",
    "* retraction under microtubules depletion : * as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , neurites retract in response to microtubles depletion and elongate even _ in vivo _ following stimulation of microtubules polymerisation @xcite . *",
    "* retraction with reduction of adhesivity : * by culturing neurites on different substrates , it was shown that retraction is promoted when the substrate adhesivity is reduced @xcite . * * motility is related to contractility : * finally , neurites initiate their motility in a robust way when exposed to drugs that impair their active contractility @xcite .",
    "the last two effects @xcite are particularly important as possible therapeutic targets to promote axon regeneration after trauma @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ axoplasm _ propulsion ] , we develop a mechanical model for the axoplasm ( acto - myosin and microtubules phases ) alone and study its motility properties under an applied proximal traction force . in section [ gc_propulsion ] , we model the gc ( acto - myosin phase only ) motile properties in response to a traction force applied at the trailing edge . in section [ full_neurite ] , we combine both models by assuming stress continuity at the t - domain to obtain a complete model of a growing neurite and show that it compares well with experiments .",
