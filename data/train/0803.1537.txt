    "approaching grand unification and supersymmetry in higher dimensions has been an intriguing possibility .",
    "one of the problems to be solved in grand unification is the doublet - triplet splitting . in the four - dimensional ( 4d ) minimal su(5 )",
    "grand unified model , an adjoint higgs field is responsible for breaking the unified gauge group to the standard model gauge group , whereas a fundamental higgs field leads to breaking electroweak symmetry .",
    "this fundamental higgs field includes a color - triplet higgs field as well as the weak - doublet higgs field under the standard model gauge group . at tree level ,",
    "the triplet and doublet higgs fields acquire their masses depending on the parameters in the potential of the original adjoint and fundamental higgs fields .",
    "it is natural that these masses are of the same order . because the doublet higgs field whose vacuum expectation value is developed at the electroweak scale should be lighter than the triplet higgs field , a tuning",
    "would be needed unless the hierarchy is generated by any mechanism .",
    "in addition , even if the masses are tuned at tree level , radiative corrections can break it . in theory with extra dimensions ,",
    "higher - dimensional gauge invariance can consist of a unified gauge group while the standard model gauge group only survives on 4d .",
    "the unified gauge group is reduced to the standard model gauge group via boundary conditions in the direction of the extra dimensions . if the fundamental su(5 ) higgs field in the role of the electroweak symmetry breaking propagates in higher dimensions , the mass splitting of the triplet and doublet higgs fields can be obtained as a result of the boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "such higher - dimensional grand unified models have been widely studied  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "employing boundary conditions provides various interesting application .",
    "if in constructing 4d grand unified models one requires that the unified gauge group is a simple group or a direct product of simple groups , that it contains the standard model gauge group as a subgroup , that its rank is four and that it has complex representation , the candidates of gauge group could be not only su(5 ) but also su(3)@xmath0@xmath1su(3)@xmath2 .",
    "an unfavorable reason of adopting su(3)@xmath0@xmath1su(3)@xmath2 would be that the inclusion of matter is not minimal .",
    "if quarks are transformed as @xmath3 under su(3)@xmath0@xmath1su(3)@xmath2 , the electric charge matrix can be assigned as @xmath4 . then integer electric charges",
    "are also made from @xmath5 because the adjoint representation includes components with the integer charge @xmath6 and the third symmetric representation also includes components with the integer charge @xmath7 .",
    "if leptons are assigned in these representations , extra fields in addition to standard model fields would be involved .",
    "such additional fields should be decoupled at low energies as they are heavy . in the case where the theory is based on higher - dimensionsional gauge invariance ,",
    "the mass splitting of extra fields and matter fields can be obtained as a result of boundary conditions similar to the mass splitting for the higgs field .",
    "this type of decoupling is also used for avoiding another disputable feature in the 4d minimal su(5 ) unified model : the fermion mass relations . at a unification scale ,",
    "down - type quarks and charged leptons have the identical yukawa coupling ( matrix in flavor space , while up - type yukawa matrix is symmetric ) .",
    "their mass eigenvalues are equal . for one - loop mass correction arising from fermion self - energy with helicity flip ,",
    "the ratio of the down - type quark masses to the charged lepton masses is described in powers of gauge coupling constants . for the third generation",
    ", it provides a successful prediction and for the first two generations , the prediction seems unfavorable . in higher - dimensional gauge theory ,",
    "down - type quarks and charged leptons for the first two generations may be taken to arise from distinct origin of multiplets as extra components are decoupled via boundary conditions",
    ". then the unfavorable fermion mass relation disappears .",
    "supersymmetry breaking transmitted via extra dimensions can be a solution to no experimentally incompatible flavor changing neutral current . in gaugino mediation  @xcite@xcite ,",
    "supersymmetry is broken in a sector spatially separated from supersymmetric standard model sector and gauginos acquire masses at high energy . for squarks and sleptons , the positive masses squared are generated at low energy by renormalizaiton group flow .",
    "the regularities required to avoid flavor changing neutral currents are automatically obtained since the gauge interactions do not distinguish generations . for the renormalization group equations ,",
    "a simple possiblity of the intitial condition is that the gaugino masses have unified values as an input at high energy .",
    "if this is taken seriously , it would be natural that gaugino - mediated supersymmetry breaking is incorporated into grand unified models .",
    "if the doublet - triplet splitting by boundary conditions , no fermion mass relations for the first two generations and gaugino - mediated supersymmetry breaking are taken into account , the simplest setup would be to consider two extra dimensions . although the doublet - triplet splitting and no fermion mass relations can be simultaneously treated for one extra dimension , the source of supersymmetry breaking in gaugino mediation",
    "should not be directly coupled to the matter superfields propagating in the extra dimension . for such unified models , to contain the weak - doublet higgs fields in an adjoint representation ( a possiblity of gauge - higgs unification ) and to introduce right - handed neutrino motivate that the original higher dimensional gauge group is larger than the standard model gauge group .",
    "we consider 6d su(6 ) supersymmetric models on an orbifold , where the sizes of two extra dimensions are different . to solve the doublet - triplet splitting , higgs fields",
    "propagate in 5d or 6d .",
    "we choose the smaller compactification radius as the unification scale where the unified gauge group is broken by boundary conditions .",
    "the other compactification radius is limited so that field - theoretical description is valid .",
    "our first model has the weak - doublet higgs fields in 5d chiral superfields , which is a version with gaugino - mediated supersymmetry breaking of ref.@xcite where the doublet - triplet splitting , no proton decay from operators of dimension four or five , no mass relations for the first two generations and gauge coupling unification were achieved .",
    "our other model has the higgs doublets in the 6d gauge multipet , which is a 6d version with gaugino mediated supersymmetry breaking of ref.@xcite where yukawa couplings were given without conflicting with higher - dimensional gauge invariance and the sizes of the yukawa couplings arised from wave - function profiles of the matter zero modes determined by bulk mass parameters . in both models ,",
    "we examine gauge coupling constants beyond the energy scale of the smaller compactification radius which is the unification scale .",
    "we find very nontrivial high energy behavior of gauge coupling constants . within the region where the larger compactification radius has such a size that the gauge coupling constants are not blow - up nor zero , we find realisic patterns of yukawa coupling constants .",
    "proton stability is achieved by r invariance .",
    "although higgs fields propagate in 5d or 6d , gaugino - mediated supersymmetry breaking is quite similar to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) case with only gauge superfields propagating in bulk .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present an explicit 6d component action starting with the action already known in the 4d superfield formalism .",
    "general properties of orbifold parity , mode expansion , couplings on fixed lines and fixed points , localization and dceoupling of fields on fixed lines are shown also with explicit equations . in section 3 our approach to examine high energy behavior of gauge coupling constants",
    "gauge coupling corrections , yukawa couplings , proton stability and supersymmetry breaking are examined for the model with higgs fields in 5d multiplets in section 4 and for the model with higgs fields in the 6d gauge multiplet in section 5 . in section 6 conclusion",
