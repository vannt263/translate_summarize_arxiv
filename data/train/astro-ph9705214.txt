    "the luminosity profile of a typical spiral or s0 galaxy most often contains two components , a spheroidal bulge and a circular disk .",
    "if the galaxy possesses an active nucleus , then a high central point intensity may also be present .",
    "the projected bulge intensity profile is usually represented by an @xmath0 law ( de vaucouleurs ,  1948 ) , where @xmath1 is the distance along the major axis , say . for disks an exponential law",
    "is frequently used ( freeman ,  1970 ) .",
    "these profiles are entirely empirical , and have not been derived from a formal physical theory .",
    "however , numerical simulations in simplified situations such as those by van  albada ( 1982 ) have been able to recreate @xmath2 profiles for the bulge .    the photometric decomposition of galaxies into bulge and disk and the extraction of the parameters characterizing these components has been approached in a number of ways .",
    "early attempts at such decomposition assumed that the disk would be the dominant component in the outer regions of galaxies and that the bulge would dominate the inner regions .",
    "disk and bulge parameters were extracted by fitting for each component separately in the region in which it was dominant by authors such as kormendy ( 1977 ) and burnstein ( 1979 ) .",
    "schombert and bothun ( 1987 ) employed such a technique for initial estimation of bulge and disk parameters of simulated galaxy profiles , with standard laws describing the bulge and the disk with simulated noise .",
    "these parameters were then used as initial input to a @xmath3 fitting procedure .",
    "tests on simulated profiles indicated good recovery of both bulge and disk parameters . for a review of various 1-d decomposition techniques see simien ( 1989 ) .",
    "the conventional technique of fitting standard laws to a 1-d intensity profiles extracted from galaxy images was critically examined by knapen and van der kruit ( 1991 ) .",
    "they found that even for the same galaxy different authors derive disk scale length values with a high average scatter of 23% .",
    "such large uncertainty in the extracted structural parameters is a hindrance in the study of structure , formation and evolution of the bulge and disk of galaxies .",
    "accurate , reliable determination of bulge and disk parameters is a prerequisite for differentiating between competing galaxy formation and evolution models .",
    "the conventional one dimensional technique is also limited because it assumes 1-d image profiles can be uniquely extracted from galaxy images .",
    "this is not possible if a strong but highly inclined disk is present .",
    "a two dimensional technique which uses the entire galaxy image rather than a major axis profile overcomes this difficulty .",
    "such a technique was proposed by byun and freeman ( 1995 ) , henceforth bf95 .",
    "a similar approach was used by r. s. de jong to extract parameters for a sample of 86 face on disc dominated galaxies ( de jong , 1996 ) , henceforth dj96 .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a 2-d decomposition technique similar to the one employed in bf95 . extending this work",
    ", we fit for a central point source in addition to a bulge and a disk .",
    "in addition , our method takes into account the effects of convolution with a psf and of photon shot noise from sky background and the galaxy .",
    "we believe that psf convolution will significantly affect parameters , especially those of the bulge .",
    "we also study the effects of the convolution on the extraction of a point source .",
    "we also try to quantify effects of other features such as foreground stars on parameter extraction .",
    "we illustrate the efficacy of our methods by extracting bulge and disk parameters for three galaxies in two different filters .",
    "we also briefly discuss reliability of error bars on parameters extracted .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe our method of constructing artificial galaxy images as tests for our bulge  disk  point decomposition procedure .",
    "section 3 describes the decomposition procedure .",
    "section 4 is a detailed analysis of the testing we performed on it , using artificial galaxy images .. section 5 is a description of application of the technique to three real galaxies .",
    "section 6 contains a discussion about error bars on the parameters extracted .",
    "section 7 contains the conclusions .",
    "in order to test the bulge and disk decomposition procedure , we have developed a galaxy image simulation code to generate images closely resembling those obtained using ccd detectors on optical telescopes . using the code it is possible to simulate a ccd image of a galaxy with an arbitrary bulge , disk and point at an arbitrary position and orientation on the ccd .",
    "the image can be convolved with a given circular or elliptic psf and poisson noise can be added if required .",
    "stars can be introduced into the image at random positions and additional features of galaxies such as absorbing dust lanes can be added .",
    "all parameters used by the program can be easily modified by the user through a parameter file .",
    "galaxy profiles are the projections of three dimensional luminosity profiles onto the plane of the sky .",
    "the disk is inherently circular , so it projects as an ellipse .",
    "the inclination angle of the disk with respect to the plane of the sky completely determines the ellipticity of the disk in the image .",
    "bulges , taken to be triaxial ellipsoids in the general case , also project as ellipses .",
    "the ellipticity of the bulge does not reach such high values as the disk . for a triaxial ellipsoid with major axis @xmath4 , minor axis @xmath5 , and an intermediate axis @xmath6 , the highest possible ellipticity will be @xmath7 .",
    "therefore the projected galaxy shows elliptical bulge isophotes and in many cases  more elliptical disk isophotes .    for an arbitrary point on the image plane ,",
    "intensity contribution comes from the bulge and the disk , and depends on their respective central intensities , ellipticities and scale lengths .",
    "near the galaxy center there is an additional contribution from the point source , if one is present .    in our galaxy simulation , the projected bulge component",
    "is represented by the @xmath8 de vaucouleurs law with effective ( half light ) radius @xmath9 ( which is the radius within which half the total light of the galaxy is contained ) , intensity at the half light radius @xmath10 and a constant ellipticity @xmath11 : @xmath12 } , \\\\",
    "r_{bulge } & = & \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2/(1 - e_b)^2 } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the distances from the center along the major and minor axis respectively .",
    "the projected disk is represented by an exponential distribution with central intensity @xmath15 , scale length @xmath16 and a constant ellipticity @xmath17 , @xmath18 the disk is inherently circular .",
    "the ellipticity of the disk in the image is due to projection effects alone and is given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the angle of inclination of the circular disk with the image plane .",
    "finally , the point source is represented by an intensity added to the central pixel of the galaxy prior to convolution .",
    "we use these empirical laws for the bulge and the disk keeping in mind that they do not satisfactorily describe all galaxies .",
    "features such as stars can be added if required .",
    "stars are added at random positions as intensities at a single pixel prior to convolution with the psf .",
    "the convolution with the psf is performed in the fourier domain . for adding photon shot noise ,",
    "a constant sky background is added to every pixel .",
    "the resultant count in each pixel ( which includes intensity from the galaxy as well as the sky background ) is multiplied by the gain ( electrons / adu ) .",
    "a random poisson deviate about this value is obtained .",
    "the deviate is then divided by the gain and the background is subtracted out .",
    "the program takes about 15 seconds to generate a galaxy image , when running on a sparcstation 10 for a 256 @xmath21 256 pixel image .",
    "a copy of this code ( written entirely in ansi c ) is available upon request .",
    "the model to be fit is constructed using the same procedure as the simulated images described in the previous section , except that features of the image that are not contributed by the galaxy such as stars and poisson noise are not added .      to effect the decomposition",
    ", we attempt to iteratively minimize the difference between our model and the observed galaxy ( or a simulated one ) , as measured by a @xmath22 value . for each pixel",
    "the observed galaxy counts are compared with those predicted by the test model .",
    "each pixel is weighted with the variance of its associated intensity as determined by photon shot noise of the combined sky and galaxy counts at that pixel .",
    "photon shot noise obeys poisson statistics and so the variance is equal to the intensity value .",
    "hence :    @xmath23 ^ 2 \\over i_{obs}(i , j)},\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 range over the whole image , @xmath25 ( number of fitted parameters ) is the number of degrees of freedom with @xmath26 being the number of pixels in the image involved in the fit , and @xmath27 is assumed to be greater than zero in all cases .",
    "ccd images of galaxies contain features such as foreground stars and bad pixels that may contaminate the decomposition procedure .",
    "we take care to block out bad pixels and visible foreground stars before commencing decomposition .    for real galaxies ,",
    "our decomposition program assumes that pixel values @xmath28 represent real photon counts .",
    "if the image has been renormalized in any way ( divided by the exposure time for example ) , the extracted @xmath22 value should be multiplied by the appropriate factor to account for that normalization .",
    "seven fitting parameters are used in our scheme .",
    "these are @xmath29 @xmath30 and a central point source intensity @xmath31 .",
    "the first 4 parameters were used by schombert and bothun ( 1987 ) , and the first six were used by the authors of bf95 and dj96 .",
    "we have added capability in our code to fit for position angle and a constant background . during our preprocessing",
    "we estimate the background carefully and subtract it out . where it is possible in real cases , fitting for sky background is not required .",
    "the minimization uses minuit 94.1 , a multidimensional minimization package from cern , written in standard fortran 77 .",
    "minuit allows the user to set the initial value , the resolution , and the upper and lower limits of any parameter in the function to be minimized .",
    "values of one or more parameters can be kept fixed during a run .",
    "minuit has several strategies to perform the minimization .",
    "our method of choice is migrad , a stable variation of the davidon  fletcher  powell variable metric algorithm .",
    "it calls the user function ( in our case @xmath32 ) iteratively , adjusting the parameters until certain criteria for a minimum are met .",
    "our code typically takes 0.1 seconds per iteration on a sgi indigo 2 workstation , when working on a 64 @xmath33 64 pixel galaxy image . on a slower sparcstation 10 , time taken increases by a factor of about 1.5 . since we are using fast fourier transforms to convolve the model with a gaussian psf , the execution time",
    "can be expected to scale as @xmath34 , with @xmath26 the total number of pixels in the image .",
    "we do find that execution time scales almost linearly with the number of pixels in the image .",
    "about 1000 iterations are required for convergence criteria to be satisfied when all 7 parameters are kept free , so a typical run takes less than two minutes .",
    "computation time is reduced as the number of free parameters is reduced .",
    "a copy of this code ( written mostly in ansi c with some optional display routines in idl ) is available upon request .",
    "we conducted elaborate tests of the effectiveness of the program in extracting parameters under different input conditions .",
    "the tests of error in psf measurements serve as warnings against claiming too much accuracy in the extraction of a point without very accurate measurements of the psf .      to test the accuracy and reliability of our algorithm",
    ", we constructed a wide range of model galaxies with idealized bulge and disk components .",
    "images of 500 model galaxies were generated by random uniform selection of intensities , scale lengths and ellipticities .",
    "the ranges we used for each of the parameters are ,    1 .   for the bulge",
    "@xmath35 2 .   and for the disk @xmath36    the ranges chosen for the parameters encompass most values encountered in real galaxies , and the intensities were chosen to correspond to the above magnitudes using photometric data on a 1 m class telescope .",
    "note that we fit in intensity space , not magnitude space , so the values were distributed approximately uniformly in intensity space .",
    "the galaxies generated by the galaxy simulation program were then used as input to the bulge disk decomposition program .",
    "we studied how accurate and reliable the decomposition program is in recovering the input parameters .",
    "we place no additional relative constraints on permissible parameter values such as those used in bf95 .",
    "we find that the @xmath37 for the fits is worse than 2 in only 25 cases out of 500 , giving a 5% failure rate .",
    "these failures are caused by the presence in parameter space of local minima close to the starting values given to minuit , or by one or more parameters hitting their limits , causing the gradient - driven minimization routine to fail .",
    "it is possible to completely eliminate such failure by changing the initial value and constraining the range of parameters around the _ expected _ value .",
    "such a procedure can not be adopted while working with real galaxies as it is not possible to constrain the parameters _ a priori_. we find that a @xmath38 almost always corresponds to good recovery of input parameters , and a @xmath39 always corresponds to poor recovery of input parameters .",
    "poor recovery of one parameter almost always implies poor recovery of all other parameters , and a high value of @xmath40 . in the instances of poor recovery deviations from true values for different parameters",
    "are not correlated , which is consistent with the high values of @xmath40 obtained for them .",
    "the parameter errors are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig:500bargraph ] .",
    "there is a column for each parameter , with the shading indicating which failure level the bar represents .",
    "for example , for 5% of models , the program failed to extract the bulge scale length with an accuracy of better than 20% , and for 7% it failed to extract the same parameter with an accuracy of better then 10% .",
    "accuracy is defined here as the the difference of the input parameter and the recovered parameter , divided by the input parameter and expressed as a percentage .    from fig .",
    "[ fig:500bargraph ] we see that all input parameters except bulge intensity are extracted with less than 10% error in over 90% of the test cases .",
    "the bulge intensity seems to have been extracted less accurately than the other quantities .",
    "the extracted versus input data have been plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:500tst ] , with points having @xmath41 marked with a @xmath33 .",
    "note that the points with a bad fit generally lie far away from the line on which the input value equals the extracted value .",
    "most of the remaining points ( those with @xmath42 ) plotted on these graphs are tightly grouped along this line .",
    "there is no systematic trend in the deviation of extracted parameters from their true value for any of the parameters plotted . the scatter plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:500tst ] is tighter than a similar plot presented in bf95 .    in a real situation",
    ", one would not be running blind , and if minimization failed with one set of parameters , one would use different starting values and try again . it should be noted that failure in recovering parameters is easy to detect as it is always flagged by a high @xmath22 value . we conclude that for our test cases at least , the input parameters are recovered very well , and without systematic or significant deviations .",
    "we conducted a series of tests to determine how the program responds to deviations from the idealized conditions assumed in the previous section .",
    "we looked at some of the problems encountered when dealing with real images rather than simulated ones .",
    "n ratio improves with increase in exposure time .",
    "we examined the image of the same simulated galaxy using pixel counts for a bright galaxy and sky background corresponding to exposure times ranging from about 5 seconds to 8 minutes on a 1 m class telescope .",
    "the exposure times ( and hence the pixel counts ) varied by a factor of 96 and s / n ratio by a factor of about 10 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the background counts used were estimated from observations made on a 1 m class telescope in the cousins r filter .",
    "we expected that as s / n got better , the fit would improve and parameter recovery would get more accurate .",
    "we found that the accuracy of the extracted parameter values is strongly dependent on the exposure time only for very short exposures ( @xmath44 30 seconds ) ( table  [ tab : sbyn ] ) .",
    "peak counts of less than one thousand for galaxies are not very useful for the purpose of bulge disk decomposition .",
    ".effect of changing exposure time on extraction of bulge intensity [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in minimization problems , two methods are commonly employed for parameter error estimation .",
    "the first is to estimate the error from the second derivative of the function being minimized with respect to the parameter under consideration .",
    "the second is to gradually move away from the the minima until a predetermined @xmath3 is exceeded .",
    "the second method will work for a single parameter fit irrespective of whether the minima is parabolic in shape or of a more complicated nature .",
    "minuit can perform error estimations using both methods .    in any multi",
    " parameter minimization process , formal errors on the parameters can be generated from the the covariance matrix of the fit only if : ( i ) the measurement errors are normally distributed and , ( ii ) the model is linear in its parameters or ( ii ) the sample size is large enough that the uncertainties in the fitted parameters do not extend extend outside a region where the model could be replaced by a suitable linearized model .",
    "it should be noted that this criterion does not preclude the use of a non - linear fitting technique to find the fitted parameters(press et al , 1992 ) .    amongst the bulge and disk parameters that we use in the fit , two are linear ( @xmath45 and @xmath15 ) and the rest are non - linear .",
    "non - linearity is highest for @xmath46 and @xmath17 . leaving all parameters free results in rather large formal error bars on extracted parameters ( about 20- 30 % ) .",
    "the @xmath47 function is not parabolic near the minima causing erroneous error estimation by minuit when the derivative method is used . even moving away from the minima till",
    "some @xmath3 is exceeded does not work as there are multiple free parameters that are correlated .",
    "minuit is unable to compute errors using this technique .",
    "fixing the most non - linear parameters i.e. the ellipticities to their extracted value enables minuit to compute formal errors using this technique as the function can be approximated by a linearized model .",
    "the errors are however still large .",
    "fixing more parameters reduces the error bars .",
    "formal errors match those obtained from parameter recovery in the 500 model test if only _",
    "one _ parameter is left free . given the strong inherent non - linearity in our formulation of the minimization problem , the problem of obtaining formal error bars on extracted parameters , when more than one parameter is left free , may be mathematically intractable .",
    "extensive tests on simulated galaxy images show that two dimensional fitting is very successful at extracting the input parameters in an overwhelming majority of cases , and that the cases where it fails can be easily detected by looking at the @xmath22 value since failure was always accompanied by a high @xmath22 value .",
    "one major limitation of our method is that it assumes that the luminosity profile of the galaxy under consideration actually follows the empirical laws we have chosen to model it irrespective of the great variation seen in galaxy morphologies .",
    "studies of the effects of morphology such as dust absorption in disks modeled by evans ( 1982 ) on scale parameters are required if we are to develop a reliable methodology to extract parameters for galaxies with strong features such as bars , spiral arms etc .        * for galaxies with very steep luminosity profiles",
    "1-d fitting provides a better solution than 2-d methods because in such galaxies , a very large fraction of pixels have poor signal to noise which would work against a good determination by the 2-d method .",
    "* when there is large isophotal twist in the galaxy , a 1-d method works better than the 2-d one , because the 1-d method tends to follow the twisting of the ellipses by changing the position angle with radius while all 2-d methods proposed to date hold the position angle constant .",
    "* when effects of shape parameters are significant then a 1-d technique is better . as an example when a highly inclined disk is present",
    ", 1-d fits might miss it altogether .",
