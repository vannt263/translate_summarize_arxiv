    "the nmssm @xcite , which contains a singlet / singlino superfield in addition to the particle content of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , has various advantages with respect to the mssm such as the solution of the @xmath14 problem and the smaller fine - tuning @xcite .",
    "the additional singlet field results in one new cp - even and one new cp - odd state in the higgs sector which consists of three cp - even mass eigenstates ( @xmath15 ) and two cp - odd states ( @xmath16 ) in the nmssm .",
    "in contrast to the mssm , it is not certain that even at least one higgs boson can be found at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) within the nmssm .",
    "this problem can be created by the additional singlet states in the higgs sector leading to invisible decay channels of the sm - like higgs states .",
    "of particular relevance for the higgs search at the lhc in the nmssm are the decays of the lightest cp - even higgs into lighter cp - odd states , @xmath17 .",
    "this channel has been claimed to be the only means to establish a no - lose theorem for the nmssm @xcite , at least in parameter regions where the supersymmetric ( susy ) partners of ordinary standard model ( sm ) objects are made suitable heavy .",
    "also notice that the @xmath1 state could well be below the lep limit on the sm higgs mass , of 114 gev , albeit with weakened couplings to ordinary matter .    in this letter we will focus on nmssm parameter regions with light @xmath2 states ( light @xmath2 scenario ) with @xmath18 where the decay @xmath19 is not possible . in these parameter regions with large br(@xmath20 )",
    "the scope of @xmath17 decays into @xmath21 pairs ( where @xmath22 represents a jet of either heavy or light flavour and where the @xmath4 s decay leptonically ) has been found to be rather questionable @xcite .",
    "hence , here we investigate the scope of the @xmath23 channel , wherein two @xmath4 s are searched for in their muonic decays , while the other two are selected via their hadronic ones . in doing so , we exploit both the hs and vbf production channels .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 the results of a detailed parameter scan",
    "are discussed identifying the parameter regions with light @xmath2 and possibly light @xmath1 with @xmath24 gev . in section 3",
    "the @xmath1 production and decay processes are simulated with the pythia event generator @xcite and the prospects for the determination of the nmssm higgs bosons in the channel @xmath25 are discussed .",
    "we then conclude in section 4 .",
    "here we investigate the nmssm parameter space for @xmath18 , with particular interest in the cases where the aforementioned @xmath0 decays may be visible at the lhc from hs and/or vbf production processes .",
    "the nmssm higgs at the electro - weak ( ew ) scale is uniquely defined by fourteen parameters : the ratio of the doublet higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath26 , the trilinear couplings in the superpotential @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the corresponding soft susy breaking parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the effective @xmath14 parameter @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 denotes the vev of the singlet higgs field ) , the gaugino mass parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the squark and slepton trilinear couplings @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and the squark and slepton mass parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the following we will establish the nmssm parameter regions , defined in terms of the above inputs , that survive present theoretical and experimental constraints .      first we perform a ` wide ' scan over the full nmssm parameter space , where the numerical values over which the parameters have been varied are : @xmath41 @xmath42 while the remaining parameters ( entering the higgs sector at loop - level ) were fixed at @xmath43 resulting in a heavy spectrum of the susy partners of @xmath44  tev ( except for the u(1 ) and su(2 ) gauginos ) .",

    "[ final - rates ] show that , after our final scan , the population of parameter points is such that in both channels the highest cross sections are found for @xmath91 , although in the case of vbf also lower @xmath1 masses can yield sizable rates .",
    "independently of @xmath66 , the @xmath2 mass enables sizable event rates anywhere above @xmath140 , but particularly just above the threshold . at high luminosity , 100 fb@xmath125",
    ", the highest rates would correspond to 1000 events per year for hs and 8000 for vbf .",
    "the black diamond symbols in fig .",
    "[ final - rates ] denote the two nmssm benchmarks points p2 ( right point ) and p3 ( left point ) , defined in @xcite .",
    "as it can be appreciated , they correspond to event rates that are mid range amongst all those explored , hence not particularly biased towards a far too favourable nmssm setup , yet susceptible to experimental discovery .",
    "we have analysed the cp - even higgs boson @xmath1 in the nmssm decaying into @xmath141 pairs in turn yielding four @xmath4 leptons , produced at the lhc in hs and vbf production and searched for through their semi - leptonic / hadronic decays into muons and jets .",
    "we have found that there is significant potential , especially via the vbf production channel , to discover a higgs boson at the lhc in nmssm scenarios with @xmath142 which is an important step in establishing a no - lose theorem for the nmssm . in order to achieve this the same sign di - muon trigger with lower threshold @xcite",
    "is crucial .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the case @xmath142 , where the @xmath1 decay fraction into @xmath4 s in enhanced ( otherwise @xmath143 decays are dominant ) .",
    "a scan of the low - energy nmssm parameter space without assuming unification at the high scale has shown that the @xmath1 state can be very light , indeed at times lighter than the @xmath144 .",
    "this configuration does not take place in the constrained nmssm ( cnmssm ) of ref .",
    "however , we are currently investigating whether such light @xmath1 masses can be found in the nmssm with non - universal boundary conditions at the unification scale @xcite .",
    "with reference to the nmssm benchmarks points defined in @xcite , we note that those relevant to our @xmath23 channel are the p2 and p3 benchmarks , which yield event rates in the mid range amongst those explored here .",
    "our summary is preliminary , as only signal processes have been considered and only in presence of mc simulations , with no backgrounds and full detector performance enabled .",
    "the latter clearly ought to be investigated before drawing any firm conclusions and this is currently being done .",
    "however , we would like to conclude that the @xmath3jets signature from @xmath0 decays with the @xmath1 produced in hs and vbf processes does produce sizable event rates as high as 1000 events per year for hs and 8000 for vbf so that we expect that a significant part of the viable nmssm parameter space will be covered by using the signature and selection cuts suggested in our study .",
