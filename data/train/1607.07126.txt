    "there is amazing synergy among a number of developments in operator algebra theory , quantum field theory , and statistical physics that first emerged in the 1960 s and 1970 s . at the time several of these advances appeared independently , but we now understand them as part of a larger picture",
    ". their interrelation may well lead to further deep insights .",
    "the advances we think of include , on the side of mathematics , the tomita - takesaki theory for von neumann algebras @xcite , the @xmath0-positive states of woronowicz @xcite , and the self - dual cones of araki , connes , and haagerup @xcite . on the side of physics",
    ", they include the reflection positivity property discovered by osterwalder and schrader for classical fields @xcite . in perspective",
    ", we now understand how these apparently different ideas overlap as central themes in mathematics and physics .    following the ground - breaking mathematical work of tomita and takesaki , and motivated by the work of powers and strmer on states of the car algebra @xcite ,",
    "woronowicz introduced @xmath0-_positivity_. in the context of a subalgebra @xmath1 that is interchanged with its commutant @xmath2 by an antilinear homomorphism @xmath3 , this means that a state @xmath4 satisfies ( j(a)a ) 0 a_+ , . for a @xmath5-finite von neumann algebra @xmath6 with modular involution @xmath7 ,",
    "araki and connes independently realized that the normal , @xmath0-positive states constitute a _ self - dual cone _ in  @xmath8 .",
    "connes proved that @xmath5-finite von neumann algebras are classified up to isomorphism by their self - dual cone ; haagerup s subsequent generalization of these results to the non @xmath5-finite case led to the abstract formulation of tomita - takesaki theory , which proved to have a lasting impact on operator algebra theory .",
    "on the side of mathematical physics , osterwalder and schrader formulated the idea of reflection positivity in the context of the green s functions for the statistical mechanics of classical fields .",
    "in hindsight , one understands that this idea is closely related to @xmath0-positivity , with @xmath0 replaced by the time reflection @xmath9 . in this context",
    ", reflection positivity is expressed as [ general - rp-1 ] s((f)f)0 , where @xmath10 denotes the schwinger functional defined on an algebra of test functions @xmath11 , and the positivity holds on a subalgebra of functions supported at positive time .    for fermionic systems , the reflection positivity condition can be given in terms of an _ antihomomorphism _",
    "@xmath12 on the @xmath13-graded algebra @xmath14 of test functions . here",
    ", the positive time subalgebra @xmath15 _ supercommutes _ with the negative time subalgebra @xmath16 .",
    "reflection positivity for a gauge - invariant functional @xmath10 means that @xmath17 for all @xmath18 . to connect with @xmath0-positivity ,",
    "note that as the algebra is super - commutative , @xmath19 is an antilinear _",
    "@xmath20 denotes the @xmath13-degree of @xmath11 , which is 0 for even and @xmath21 for odd elements . in terms of @xmath9 ,",
    "the reflection positivity condition becomes [ eq : fermion ] i^^2s((f)f)0 .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we discovered that gives the correct formulation of reflection positivity for majorana fermions , where the @xmath13-graded algebra is no longer super - commutative .    in this paper",
    "we generalize this condition to the case of a neutral functional @xmath10 on a @xmath22-graded ( rather than @xmath23 graded ) algebra .",
    "we find that the reflection positivity condition becomes [ general - rp-3 ] ^^2s((f)f)0 , with @xmath11 a homogeneous element of @xmath15 of degree @xmath20 , and with @xmath24 an appropriate @xmath25 root of unity .",
    "the importance of the osterwalder - schrader construction stems from the fact that the hilbert space of _ every _ known scalar quantum theory arises as a quantization defined by this framework ; quantum theories with fermions or gauge fields arise as generalizations of this approach .",
    "another early application of reflection positivity was its use in papers of glimm , jaffe , and spencer to give the first proof in that interacting , non - linear quantum fields satisfy the wightman axioms @xcite . shortly afterward , these authors used reflection positivity to give the first mathematical proof that discrete symmetry breaking and phase transitions exist in certain quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "the analysis of tomita - takesaki theory led bisognano and wichmann to identify the tcp reflection @xmath9 in quantum field theory with a specific case of the tomita reflection @xmath0 defined for wedge shaped regions @xcite .",
    "sewell recognized that the bisognano - wichmann theory yields an interpretation of hawking radiation from black holes @xcite .",
    "hislop and longo analyzed the modular structure of double cone algebras in great detail @xcite .",
    "also much work of borchers , buchholz , fredenhagen , rehren , summers , and others has been devoted to aspects of relations between local quantum field theory and tomita - takesaki theory .    turning from quantum mechanics to lattice statistical physics ,",
    "reflection positivity was established by osterwalder and seiler for lattice gauge theory @xcite , as well as for the super - commutative , @xmath13-graded algebra appearing in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "reflection positivity was also central in the first proof of continuous symmetry breaking in lattice systems , through the proof and use of `` infrared bounds '' by frhlich , simon , and spencer @xcite .",
    "reflection positivity also led to many results by frhlich , israel , lieb , and simon @xcite , for bosonic quantum systems in classical and quantum statistical physics .",
    "the analysis of reflection positivity in the papers @xcite used a _ cone _ of reflection positive elements .",
    "this cone mirrors the positivity conditions  for bosonic and fermionic systems .",
    "the cone consists of elements [ cone-1 ] ( a)a , a _ + , where @xmath15 is the algebra of observables on one side of the reflection plane . in terms of the antilinear homomorphism @xmath9 ,",
    "the cones of osterwalder , schrader , and seiler consist of elements of the form [ cone-2 ] i^^2(a)a , a_+ . in hindsight",
    ", it is clear that these cones are closely related to the self - dual cone of araki , connes and haagerup .    in this paper , we isolate a minimal framework for reflection positivity , covering a variety of different and useful examples , including the above . in brief , we work with a @xmath26-graded , locally convex algebra @xmath14 , equipped with an antilinear homomorphism @xmath27 called the _",
    "reflection_.    let @xmath1 be a graded subalgebra , and @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 squares to the identity and inverts the grading .",
    "then @xmath14 is called the _ q - double _ of @xmath15 if the linear span of @xmath29 is dense in @xmath14 , and if @xmath15 _ paracommutes _ with @xmath16 , meaning that [ eq : exchangeintro ] a_-a_+ = q^a_+a_- , for homogeneous @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 is a @xmath32 root of unity , and @xmath33 denotes the degree of @xmath34 in @xmath26 .",

    "we find it useful to consider the expression as a specialization of a reflection - invariant , twisted product , [ twistedproduct ] ( a)a = ^^2(a)a .",
    "parafermionic commutation relations were proposed in field theory by green @xcite .",
    "they are closely tied to representations of the braid group , which lead to a variety of different statistics , see for example  @xcite .",
    "recently , fendley gave a parafermionic representation of baxter s clock hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , jaffe and pedrocchi gave sufficient conditions for reflection positivity on the @xmath41-graded part of the parafermion algebra , and used this to study topological order @xcite .",
    "jaffe and liu found a geometric interpretation of reflection positivity in the framework of planar para algebras , relating reflection positivity in that case to @xmath42 positivity @xcite .",
    "their proof uses an elegant pictorial interpretation for the twisted product @xmath43 in , as an interpolation between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "recently the ideas from tomita - takesaki theory have been used by workers in string theory , for instance in the analysis of the black hole complementarity radiation , see @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that string theory representations of black - hole partition functions of the form @xmath46 , proposed in @xcite , have an origin in ( and an explanation based on ) reflection positivity .",
    "let @xmath47 be a continuous , reflection positive ` background functional ' , and let @xmath48 be a reflection invariant element of degree zero .",
    "the main problem is to determine necessary and sufficient conditions on @xmath49 for the functional [ eq : overviewboltzmann ] _",
    "h(a ) = ( ae^-h ) to be reflection positive . in the case of statistical physics , @xmath49 is a hamiltonian and @xmath50 defines the boltzmann functional for the system . in the case of functional integrals for quantum theory , @xmath49 is a perturbation of the action .",
    "in  [ sec : section2 ] we give the basic definitions . in  [ sec : applications ] , we apply this general setting to a variety of different situations : tomita - takesaki theory and von neumann algebras ( describing bosonic systems ) , grassmann algebras ( describing fermionic classical systems ) , and clifford algebras and car algebras ( describing fermionic quantum systems ) .",
    "finally , we introduce the _ parafermion algebra _ and the _ cpr algebra _ , the analogues of clifford and car algebras for parafermions .",
    "let us point out that in our general setting , we do _ not _ assume that @xmath14 is a @xmath51-algebra , nor that @xmath52 is a state .",
    "this allows our framework to cover cases such as berezin integration on grassmann algebras @xcite , and neutral complex fields in the sense of  @xcite .",
    "in  [ sect : sforrp ] and  [ sect : n - sforrp ] , we return to the problem of determining reflection positivity of @xmath50 in the general setting .",
    "our first main result is theorem  [ thm : sufficient ] ; the boltzmann functional @xmath50 is reflection positive if @xmath49 allows a decomposition @xmath53 where @xmath54 is in @xmath15 , @xmath55 is the reflection of @xmath56 in @xmath16 , and @xmath57 is in the closure of the convex hull of @xmath38 .",
    "although the decomposition is familiar , the result is new for hamiltonians of the generality that we study here .",
    "our second major result , theorem [ thm : necessary ] , states that these conditions are not only sufficient , but also necessary , under additional factorization and nondegeneracy hypotheses on the ` background ' functional  @xmath52 .",
    "these extra assumptions are reasonable , and generally assumed , in the framework of statistical physics .    in our third main result ,",
    "theorem  [ thm : neccandsuff ] , we formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for reflection positivity in terms of the _ matrix of coupling constants across the reflection plane_. these are the coefficients @xmath58 of @xmath49 with respect to a distinguished , reflection - invariant basis @xmath59 of the zero - graded algebra @xmath60 .",
    "this is particularly relevant in the context of statistical physics , where the hamiltonian is usually given in terms of couplings .",
    "theorem  [ thm : neccandsuff ] then allows one to easily check reflection positivity in concrete situations .",
    "we end the paper with an extensive list of examples in the context of lattice statistical physics . in  [ sec : latphys ] , we discuss the lattices we use",
    ".    in  [ sec : bosonicsystems ] , we specialize our results to bosonic classical and quantum systems .",
    "a special feature of _ classical _ systems is that the lattice can contain fixed points under the reflection .",
    "we exploit this to prove the following : suppose that the reflection is in one of the coordinate directions , that the lattice is rectangular , and that it has nontrivial intersection with the reflection plane .",
    "then _ every _ reflection - invariant nearest neighbor hamiltonian yields a reflection positive boltzmann measure",
    ".    in  [ sec : fermionicsystems ] , we specialize our results to fermionic classical and quantum systems . in the classical case ,",
    "the ` background functional ' is the berezin integral on the grassmann algebra , and in the quantum case , it is the tracial state on the clifford algebra or car algebra .",
    "the results in this section generalize the examples in our previous work @xcite .    in  [ sec",
    ": latticeqcd ] , we apply our results in the context of lattice gauge theories . in particular",
    ", we give a new , gauge equivariant proof of reflection positivity for the expectation defined by the wilson action .",
    "in contrast to the proofs in @xcite , we prove reflection positivity on the _ full _ algebra of observables , not just on the gauge invariant subalgebra .    finally , in  [",
    "sec : parafermionsno2 ] , we give a complete characterization of reflection positivity for parafermions .",
    "this extends the results of @xcite from the degree zero subalgebra @xmath61 to the full algebra @xmath15 , and ties in with the results of jaffe and liu @xcite on the geometric interpretation of reflection positivity for planar para algebras .",
    "in this section , we introduce the basic notions needed to treat reflection positivity in the @xmath26-graded setting .",
