    "the prediction   in 1997 by diakonov , petrov and polyakov ( dpp )  @xcite of the @xmath4 baryon denoted @xmath2 at 1540 mev with a narrow width @xmath5 mev and the subsequent experimental confirmation of the state published in 2003 by nakano et al  @xcite with mass @xmath6 mev and a width @xmath7 mev have spurred a huge activity both in experiment and in theory .",
    "what was remarkable in the dpp work was that it was an elegantly simple prediction based on a clearly defined theoretical framework of chiral solitons and that considering the qualitative nature of the soliton model , the prediction was confirmed surprisingly quantitatively .",
    "since then there have been a flurry of activities with conflicting results  @xcite , some pro and some con , both in theory and in experiment and the verdict on the existence or non - existence of the @xmath2 is yet to come out from the experimental side .",
    "fortunately a clear - cut experimental confirmation or refutation is expected to be forthcoming in the near future .",
    "the discovery of pentaquark baryons will undoubtedly be a boon for hadron spectroscopy .",
    "i would like to further suggest that independently of whether or not the @xmath0 in question exists in nature , the development brings out a highly intriguing theoretical issue tied to chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking in matter .",
    "this is the topic of my talk here .    for the discussions that follow",
    ", i will assume that the @xmath2 exists .",
    "even if it is proven to be non - existent by forthcoming experiments , what i will discuss will still be relevant for other issues i will make reference to , so in either case , my discussions will not be futile . for definiteness i will focus solely on the singlet member of the @xmath8 multiplet to which the @xmath2 is assumed to belong . for the physically more meanigful spectroscopy of pentaquark baryons , a lot more work will be needed .",
    "also i shall not touch on quark - model descriptions , focusing instead on the  dual \" skyrmion description .",
    "when the prediction for the @xmath2 was first made in 1980 s and later in 1990 s , it was considered to be a unique prediction of the chiral soliton model not shared by quark models in that it naturally arose from the model on the same footing as the baryons described in terms of @xmath9 quarks in the quark model . in the naive quark picture , the @xmath2 is  exotic \" since it requires at the minimum four quarks and one antiquark .",
    "but of course there is nothing sacred in this naive picture",
    ". why should there not be baryons that carry more than @xmath10 valence quarks just as in nuclear physics more than valence particles are involved in nuclear spectroscopy ?",
    "so in this sense , there is nothing really  exotic \" about the five - quark structure of a baryon in qcd .",
    "in fact , in the large @xmath10 limit , @xmath11 baryons in the skyrmion model can be matched one - to - one to constituent quark model  @xcite .",
    "however for convenience of understanding what we mean , i will refer to the standard @xmath10 quark baryons as  non - exotic \" and to all others  exotic . \"",
    "the skyrmion prediction typified by dpp was based on the usual skyrme lagrangian & = & _ u^u^+[u^_u , u^_u]^2 + & & + tr(m(u + u^-2 ) ) + [ skyrmel ] where @xmath12 is a constant related to the pion decay constant @xmath13 mev , @xmath14 is an unknown constant , @xmath15 is the chiral field , @xmath16 is the three - flavor mass matrix and the ellipsis ignored in the standard treatments stands for higher dimension terms involving derivatives and mass matrices etc .",
    "the skyrmion given by the lagrangian ( [ skyrmel ] ) is then quantized by what is called  rigid rotor \" method , that is , collective - quantized with all flavors put on the same footing .    in describing baryons as chiral solitons , regardless of whether it involves only chiral fields or a hybrid of chiral fields and quark fields , there are two immediate issues in this approach .",
    "one is how good the chiral lagranigian used is as an effective theory of qcd from which baryons are built and the other is how reliable the quantization of the soliton is .",
    "some of these issues are discussed in the monograph  @xcite .",
    "let me address the first of these issues in this subsection relegating the second to the next subsection .",
    "the skyrmion is a description of baryons valid in the @xmath10 limit , so we wish to have an effective lagrangian that is close to qcd in that limit .",
    "let us look at ( [ skyrmel ] ) .",
    "the first term of ( [ skyrmel ] ) is the term that encodes the known current algebras , so it is a highly trustful lowest - dimension term in effective field theory .",
    "however the second term , so - called skyrme term , is one of several quartic terms that one can write down on the basis of general dimensional and symmetry arguments .",
    "given our almost complete ignorance of qcd at low - energy nonperturbative regime , however , it has not been feasible to  derive \" directly from qcd terms other than the current algebra term .",
    "it is plausible that a quartic term of the skyrme - type arises from heavier meson degrees of freedom of a given quantum number when one integrates out all higher energy degrees of freedom other than the pseudo - goldstone bosons but there is no reason why other vector mesons such as @xmath17 ... and heavy scalar mesons etc . should not give rise to similar  but different forms of  four - derivative terms .",
    "in fact there is no theoretical reason whatsoever why one would wind up with only one term like the skyrme term if one is  deriving \" them from qcd _ per se_.",
    "as i will mention below , an unexpected support for this skyrme - type term comes from string theory : using  ads / qcd holographic duality , \" qcd can be expressed as a compactified theory of five - dimensional yang - mills gauge theory  @xcite from which at low energy the skyrme term arises with a coefficient fixed in terms of the string variables in addition to a tower of vector mesons populating up to a given cutoff scale .",
    "this term is there whether or not one takes explicitly into account the low - lying vector mesons @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath17 , etc . given by the bulk sector in addition to the tower of vector gauge fields",
    ", it must represent shorter distance scales than the tower of vector mesons . and/or",
    "@xmath19 , are used to stabilize the soliton as in  @xcite .",
    "this short - distance term must be the skyrme term that figures in the description of the monopole catalysis of the nucleon decay given in terms of the unwinding of the skyrmion  @xcite .",
    "it would also resolve the problem of the unrealistic @xmath19 repulsion in dense medium seen in  @xcite where an @xmath19 with a finite mass was used for stabilization . ]    in most of the work on skyrmions ( with a few exceptions ) , the vector meson degrees of freedom have been ignored or integrated out . in @xcite ,",
    "the role of vector mesons in the hyperon structure was first investigated and it was noted that while the explicit account in the skyrmion structure of the lowest - lying nonet vector mesons definitely improves the spectroscopy for the @xmath20 baryons but there was no qualitative influence .",
    "it will turn out however that the vector mesons in hidden local gauge fields can make a drastic effect on @xmath21 baryons , i.e. , pentaquarks .",
    "this will be seen to be closely linked to hidden local symmetry .",
    "it has been debated in the literature as to whether the skyrmion description of pentaquark baryons can be taken seriously as modelling qcd .",
    "it has even been suggested that it can be invalidated by experiments .",
    "i would think that this debate will be settled if indeed the ads / qcd duality is correct .",
    "as mentioned , the duality means that the skyrmion description for baryons is a holographic dual to the quark descriptions , so they describe the same physics .",
    "if there is any difference , it will only be in the approximations one makes in doing the calculations , not in the principle .",
    "a similar point of view is voiced by diakonov  @xcite from a different starting point .",
    "the next issue in the skyrmion description of the @xmath2 has to do with how one quantizes the skyrmion in consistency with the @xmath10 counting .",
    "the @xmath10 dependence of the baryon mass can be written as m = a n_c + b + c / n_c + [ mass ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ... are @xmath10-independent coefficients .",
    "the @xmath22 term is the classical soliton mass common to all baryons and the @xmath24 term is the rotational contribution that comes from collective quantization that splits a state with spin @xmath25 from the ground state with @xmath26 .",
    "the constant @xmath23 term contains several contributions among which the casimir energy is the most important one .",
    "the casimir calculation in baryon structure turns out to be horrendously difficult .",
    "there have been several courageous attempts ( see for reference ,  @xcite ) , but no reliable result has been obtained yet . in most of the the skyrmion work available in the literature ,",
    "one simply ignores the casimir energy and uses ( [ mass ] ) taking the constants @xmath12 and @xmath14 as arbitrary parameters fit to a set of low - energy data . as argued in @xcite ,",
    "this is not the right way of doing things .",
    "an indication that this procedure can not be reliable is that the fit value of @xmath12 is drastically different from what it is in nature , viz , the pion decay constant @xmath27 mev .",
    "although this fitting procedure may make sense in some cases , it can not be applied generally since the @xmath28 terms can in general depend on the quantum numbers involved ( e.g. , strangeness ) .",
    "furthermore the casimir calculations performed so far indicate that the @xmath28 term can be very big , though subleading in @xmath10 , and attractive",
    ". the correct procedure should be to take properly into account the casimir energy and then use the physical @xmath29 for the skyrmion properties .",
    "the formula ( [ mass ] ) applies equally to the non - exotic baryons as well as to the exotic baryons with the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 tracking the quantum numbers of the baryons .",
    "it has been pointed out by several authors  @xcite that the rigid rotor expression for the mass formula ( [ mass ] ) for the exotic channel is inconsistent with the @xmath10 counting .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "while the mass splitting between the multiplets in the non - exotic channel is given by @xmath30 term  there is no @xmath31 contribution , the splitting from the lowest ( non - exotic ) multiplet in the exotic channel has a term @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 ia a moment of inertia in the strangeness direction ) originating from the rigid rotation .",
    "but the rigid rotor method is believed to miss out some potentially important terms of the same order .",
    "for instance , in addition to the casimir energy , there can be possible ",
    "vibrational modes \" in the strangeness direction ( as in the bound - state quantization , see below ) that are not accounted for .",
    "this inconsistency in @xmath28 has been invoked  @xcite to cast doubt on the prediction despite the amazing agreement with the experiment .",
    "an alternative approach discussed by the authors in @xcite avoids this inconsistency in @xmath10 counting .",
    "the method consists of fluctuating in the strangeness + 1 direction in the background of an @xmath34 soliton , with the wess - zumino term playing the role of a magnetic field .",
    "the question is : what happens to a @xmath1 in the presence of the soliton ?",
    "this approach was first developed for the @xmath20 baryons  @xcite where @xmath35 s were found to be bound to the soliton to give the known hyperons .",
    "in fact it is this binding approach that one should resort to when one is considering heavy - light - quark baryons since that is the natural way to incorporate heavy - quark symmetry into a chiral symmetric lagrangian . here the kaon can be thought of as a vibration  which is of @xmath28  as contrasted to the rotation  which is typically of @xmath36 .",
    "since the kaon vibrational energy is of the same order in @xmath10 as the casimir energy , in principle both should be treated on the same footing .",
    "due to the difficulty with the casimir calculation , a consistent calculation of this sort has not been done .",
    "i would think that such a calculation will ultimately be needed to understand the @xmath2 structure as i will mention at the end .",
    "the crucial element in the bound state picture is the wess - zumino term responsible for the five pseudoscalar coupling , @xmath37 . in the description with ( [ skyrmel ] )",
    "supplemented with the topological wess - zumino term , this coupling  the strength of which is fixed by topology  is attractive for the @xmath20 channel accounting for the binding .",
    "however for the @xmath21 channel , the sign change makes the wess - zumino term repulsive . therefore with the standard parameters that describe the non - exotic baryons , there can not be binding nor resonance with a small width  @xcite .",
    "it was found that if the kaon mass were much bigger ( i.e. , stronger @xmath38 breaking ) or the wess - zumino term were smaller by a factor of @xmath39 , a @xmath1 could be quasi - bound or produce a narrow - width resonance .",
    "this model as it stands therefore can not accommodate a narrow - width resonance of the @xmath2 quantum number .",
    "this result may also augur on the validity of the rigid rotor description  @xcite . in the limit that the kaon mass goes to zero ,",
    "the rigid rotor zero mode is recovered smoothly as @xmath40 for the @xmath20 channel .",
    "the bound - state and the rigid rotor models agree in the chiral limit . on the contrary , for the @xmath21 channel",
    ", the bound - state model has no solution that goes over to the zero mode of the rigid rotor model .",
    "this result has been confirmed by the calculation with hidden local symmetry theory to be described below  @xcite that does support a bound state for a reasonable parameter of the hls lagrangian .",
    "several questions are raised at this point .",
    "is it that the skyrmion model as a whole , independently of how it is quantized , does not accommodate the @xmath2 baryon ? does this mean that the rigid rotor result which gave the uncanny prediction is accidental ? some of these questions will be addressed below .",
    "when the light - quark vector mesons are included as relevant degrees of freedom , there can be a dramatic change in the structure of the @xmath21 baryons although they leave more or less unaffected the @xmath20 baryons . in this respect , treating the vector mesons as gauge fields has a power that is not available in non - gauge invariant approaches .",
    "i shall discuss why local gauge invariance possesses such power and how such local gauge invariance can arise from first principles .      to bring out a general idea ,",
    "let me consider , following ref.@xcite , a massive vector field lagrangian = - f_2 ^ 2 + a_2 ^ 2 + .[massivel ] which is a lagrangian describing a massive vector excitation with the mass m_a_2=f g_2 .",
    "this can be gotten by taking @xmath41 from & = & -f_1 ^ 2 - f_2 ^ 2 + ( a_1-a_2)^2 + & & + .[gauge - fl ] being massive , the lagrangian ( [ massivel ] ) or ( [ gauge - fl ] ) has no gauge symmetry . but introducing a goldstone scalar field @xmath42 which transforms as ug_2 ^ -1 u g_1 one can write a gauge invariant - lagrangian that has the same low - energy physics as ( [ gauge - fl ] ) , = -f_1 ^ 2 - f_2 ^ 2 + |d_u|^2 + with the covariant derivative defined by d_u=_+ ia_1 u - i ua_2.[gauge - il ] this lagrangian is invariant under the gauge symmetry @xmath43 . to get to ( [ gauge - fl ] ) , it suffices to gauge fix @xmath44 to the unitary gauge , @xmath45 .",
    "so what is the big deal with the gauge invariance ?    let us suppose that the lagrangian ( [ massivel ] ) is only a part of an effective theory to be embedded into a more complicated system . at higher orders that should come in as one goes up in scale , there would be terms of the form a^4 ,  ( a)^2 , [ higherderivative ] such terms are naturally generated when one calculates higher - order terms by doing loop calculations which requires that additional equivalent terms be added to renormalize the loop terms . without any systematic ways of accounting for higher order terms , it will require an arduous book - keeping to correctly put all terms of the same order .",
    "local gauge symmetry can do this systematically with little effort by replacing ( [ higherderivative ] ) by the covariant derivatives |d_u|^4 ,   |d^2 u|^2 , [ covariantdervative ] this allows a systematic account of higher - order terms to any order .",
    "this is important in the case where we have not only the goldstone bosons , e.g. , pions , as physical particles but also the vector fields whose mass can be @xmath46 light as in hot and/or dense matter  @xcite .",
    "another advantage is that with the goldstone bosons explicitly treated instead of being  eaten up , \" the theory of the massive vector bosons remains sensible in the effective theory sense up to the cutoff @xmath47 . above that scale ,",
    "a microscopic theory has to take over ( that is , be  ultraviolet completed \" ) . in our case ,",
    "the ultraviolet completion is done to qcd .",
    "there is a growing evidence that qcd at low energy can be described as a chiral @xmath48 symmetric theory with a tower of vector mesons , scalars and goldstone bosons , all coupled gauge invariantly .",
    "the structure i will use here for the pentaquatk problem is the one where only the lowest multiplet of the vectors @xmath49 and pions @xmath50 are taken into account , with scalars and higher towers of the vectors  integrated out . \"",
    "the lagrangian will be taken in the form  @xcite   and @xmath51 .",
    "note that i use here @xmath52 in place of @xmath53 , with @xmath54 corresponding to @xmath55 which will play a prominent role in what follows . in what follows",
    ", @xmath53 will be used instead of @xmath52 . ] & = & \\{|d__l|^2 + |d__r|^2 + |d_(_l_r)|^2 } + & & - + [ hls ] with @xmath56 transforming under chiral @xmath57 as _",

    "in an arbitrary gauge , @xmath61 can be parameterized as _ l / r = e^i / f _ e^i / f_. with the definition a=(f_/f_)^2,[a ] @xmath52 is given by = .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath54 or @xmath55 has a special feature .",
    "the lagrangian becomes  local \" with no mixing of the l and r chiral fields .",
    "one refers to this structure as  theory space locality \"  @xcite .",
    "if one preserves this theory space locality , one can then make a chain of gauge fields @xmath62 sandwiched by the  link \" fields @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this gives what is referred to in the literature as  open moose \" diagram with the lagrangian  @xcite = _",
    "j=1^k+1|d^j|^2  - _",
    "[ hlsk ] here we have replaced the  pion decay constant \" @xmath65 by a generalized constant @xmath66 corresponding to the @xmath67-th link field and @xmath68 by @xmath69 to accommodate @xmath70 gauge fields .",
    "the covariant derivatives are of the form @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 with @xmath74 . if we let @xmath75 , then ( [ hlsk ] ) can be interpreted as a lagrangian for five - dimensional gauge theory with the fifth dimension put on lattice . indeed making it continuous leads to a gauge invariant theory given in a generally curved space ( that is , with a non - flat metric ) in five dimensions . physically what that means is that by putting in the infinite tower of vector mesons with local gauge invariance , one can  deconstruct \" the fifth dimension which represents the energy scale  @xcite .      in @xcite ,",
    "erlich et al interpret the dimensionally deconstructed five - dimensional gauge theory implemented with certain scalar fields as the bulk theory in the ( 5-d ) ads space which via holography correspond to low - energy qcd in four dimensions on the boundary .",
    "they obtain , using the strategy of ads / cft duality , quite a reasonable low - energy hadron dynamics with three bulk parameters fit to the pion and @xmath18 masses and the pion decay constant .",
    "as already mentioned above and reported in this meeting by sugimoto , sakai and sugimoto  @xcite go the other way .",
    "they insert @xmath76 pairs of flavor d8 branes as probes into the ads sector with a background of @xmath10 color d4 branes and assuming @xmath77 , obtain five - dimensional gauge theory which when compactified to four dimensions , gives hls theory with a tower of vector mesons , with the parameters of the theory fixed by the bulk parameters .",
    "the results agree fairly well with experiments .",
    "i can not give a full justice to this remarkable feat as the calculation requires involved arguments in a language not entirely familiar to me .",
    "but what is most noteworthy is that the scheme gives in four dimensions precisely the hidden local symmetry structure of bando et al  @xcite and harada / yamawaki  @xcite including the gauged wess - zumino term and @xmath78 fixes the skyrme quartic term uniquely in terms of the bulk parameters .",
    "_ an important consequence of this is that baryons must emerge in ads / qcd as skyrmions in the hidden local symmetry theory . _",
    "what appears to be potentially important for the pentaquark structure i will describe below is that the sakai - sugimoto model predicts what corresponds to @xmath53 , eq.([a ] ) , in the limit of large @xmath10 , a1.3 .",
    "it is close to what was obtained at the matching point by harada and yamawaki in their best - fit analysis  @xcite and is closer to 1 than to 2 required by the vector dominance as will be further elaborated below .",
    "little is known of the theories with @xmath79 in ( [ hlsk ] ) although there are some developments that indicate that the dimensionally deconstructed theory is close to nature  @xcite .",
    "i shall therefore focus on the harada - yamawaki hls theory ( [ hls ] ) which has been extensively analyzed and fairly well understood  @xcite .",
    "we will be dealing with the theory that should work up to the cutoff given by @xmath80 gev ; we can think of having integrated out all except the pions and the nonet vector mesons ( assuming flavor @xmath81 symmetry ) generically denoted by @xmath49 .",
    "the axial vectors are not considered explicitly .",
    "the basic premise in hy theory is that the strong interaction dynamics is governed by the hadronic degrees of freedom picked for consideration , i.e. , the pions and vector mesons , below the cutoff @xmath82 and by the qcd degrees of freedom , quarks and gluons , above the cutoff .",
    "it is assumed that there is a region in between , say , @xmath83 , in which the two regimes overlap .",
    "it is not obvious that such a region can be picked reliably without ambiguity but this is the best one can do if the effective theory is to be operative up to around @xmath82 beyond which qcd has to take over .",
    "hy do this by matching at @xmath84 gev the two descriptions in terms of the vector and axial correlators defined by @xmath85 where @xmath86 . in hls these two - point functions at the matching point @xmath82",
    "are completely described by tree contributions with @xmath87 terms included when the momentum is around the matching scale , @xmath88 . in the qcd sector",
    "they are given by ope expressed in terms of the running ( color ) gauge coupling @xmath89 , the quark condensate @xmath90 , the gluon condensate @xmath91 and combinations thereof at the given scale @xmath82 .",
    "the matching allows the parameters @xmath65 , @xmath92 or @xmath53 and the hidden gauge coupling @xmath93 to be expressed in terms of the qcd quantities that are in principle calculable at a given scale .",
    "this completely defines the @xmath94 lagrangian for hls theory .",
    "in this theory , the vector mesons can be treated as  light \" in the chiral counting scheme .",
    "thanks to gauge invariance , in the large @xmath10 limit at which the quantity @xmath95 with a fixed vector meson mass is suppressed , higher orders in chiral perturbation expansion can be systematically formulated , an advantage which is not shared by non - gauge invariant or gauge fixed approaches .",
    "the most important outcome of the systematic analysis of the theory at loop orders  @xcite is that there is one unique fixed point which is consistent with qcd . in general",
    "there are multitudes of fixed points at one - loop order .",
    "however constraining the rge group flow to qcd , the unique fixed point turns out to be at @xmath96 , @xmath55 and @xmath97 .",
    "this is called the  vector manifestation ( vm ) fixed point .",
    "\" whenever appropriate , i shall refer to the hls theory with the vector manifestation fixed point as hls / vm .",
    "this fixed point is obtained in the chiral limit but is believed to be relevant and useful even when quark masses are present .",
    "i shall therefore talk about the vm fixed without regard to the explicit chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the vm fixed point is reached when ( in the chiral limit ) chiral symmetry changes from goldstone mode to wigner mode or vice versa .",
    "it does not depend upon how the phase change is driven .",
    "it could be by temperature or density or the number of flavors .",
    "the vm implies that as the hadronic system approaches the critical point @xmath98 , a 1 ,  g 0 ,  f_0 so that the hidden gauge bosons become massless m_~ g f_0 . here",
    "@xmath99 is the pole mass but the parametric mass also goes to zero at that point . matching with qcd allows one to relate the scaling of the parameters to the scaling of qcd variables .",
    "thus as one approaches @xmath98 , m_~g ~|qq0 .",
    "applied to @xmath100 , this implies that near @xmath98 , @xmath11 light - quark hadron masses other than the goldstone bosons should scale as m^/m ~(|qq^/|qq)^n[br ] where the @xmath101 stands for in - medium  temperature or density  and @xmath102 a power that can depend upon the detail content of the theory .",
    "one can think of baryons as skyrmions in the theory or one can introduce quasiquarks ( or constituent quarks ) considered to be relevant near the critical point and express the scaling in terms of that of the quasiquarks .",
    "this scaling is precisely what was proposed in 1991  @xcite .",
    "even though a hadronic system is not at the vm fixed point , with @xmath104 and @xmath105 , it appears to be a good approximation to set a1 and make corrections in powers of @xmath106 .",
    "let me list a few cases known up to now where this holds .",
    "@xmath107 : 0.3 cm in computing the pion mass difference in hy s hls / vm  @xcite , one gauges the @xmath108 subgroup of the chiral symmetry in hls to introduce the em field and takes into account the mixing of the @xmath108 gauge field and @xmath109 of the @xmath34 hidden gauge field .",
    "then the one - loop em contribution to the mass difference comes out to be m_^2|_loop = & & [ ( 1-a)^2 + 3a m_^2 ^2 + & & + ] .[photonloop ] here @xmath110 is the cutoff introduced to regularize the divergent integreal . in hls / vm ,",

    "assume that the number of flavors @xmath76 is sufficiently  large \" so that we can consider @xmath53 to be near its fixed point , @xmath55 .",
    "then ignoring higher orders in @xmath112 , we can set @xmath55 in ( [ photonloop ] ) and get the total splitting as m_^2&=&(3_em/4)m_^2(_m^2/m_^2 ) + & & + m_^2|_>_m .",
    "the result @xmath113 mev@xmath114 obtained using the value @xmath55 and other parameters fixed in a best - fit to hadronic structure  @xcite is in good agreement with the experimental value @xmath115 mev@xmath114 .",
    "an interesting observation here is that the @xmath55 leads to the theory space locality eliminating the  quadratic divergence \" in ( [ photonloop ] ) .",
    "this cancelation which is effectuated in the standard current algebra approach with the weinberg sum rules with @xmath50 , @xmath18 and @xmath17 is the analog to what happens in the little higgs phenomenon in the hierarchy resolution in the standard model .",

    "it was predicted in 1992 on the basis of sigma models combining chiral symmetry and heavy quark symmetry and published in 1993  @xcite that the mass splitting @xmath120 is given approximately by the constituent ( quasiquark ) mass @xmath121 mev .",
    "this prediction was confirmed recently by the barbar and cleoii collaborations  @xcite .",
    "one unsatisfactory feature of the old prediction was that it was given in terms of the constituent quark mass which is not well defined physically .",
    "this defect can be lifted in an approach based on hls / vm  @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption made in @xcite is that the vm is a good starting point as far as chiral symmetry is concerned .",
    "so one starts with hls with the vm fixed point parameters and then makes corrections for deviation from the vm as one departs from the chiral transition point . in doing this",
    ", one takes @xmath55 and computes the deviations in other parameters , namely , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "because of the matching to qcd , one can then express @xmath122 in terms of the qcd variables , in particular the quark condensate @xmath90 .",
    "the result has the simple form m = c_quantumm_bare where m_bare=-23 with @xmath123 the @xmath124-decay constant is the contribution given by matching with qcd at the matching scale and @xmath125 is the quantum loop correction ( given , as it turned out , entirely by the @xmath18 loop ) calculated by rge . for the @xmath126 mesons , the quantum correction comes out to be @xmath127 . with this and the available values for @xmath128 and the quark condensate",
    ", one reproduces the constituent quark mass @xmath129 mev .",
    "thus the vm is not far from the real world of the chiral doublers .",
    "this prediction is a lot more clear - cut than that of @xcite since the quark condensate is a well - defined quantity for a given scale .",
    "0.3 cm    * electromagnetic form factors of the proton * 0.3 cm although @xmath53 at the matching scale is near 1 , quantum corrections ( i.e. , @xmath130 corrections ) _ in the mesonic sector _ bring it to @xmath131 at the scale corresponding to the pion on - shell .",
    "@xmath132 gives rise to the vector dominance for the pionic em form factor .",
    "now the situation with the nucleon is a different matter .",
    "there is no systematic study of quantum ( @xmath130 ) corrections to @xmath53 for the baryon sector , so we have no theoretical information on how good the vd is for nucleons or baryons in general .",
    "but there are empirical evidences that the vd with @xmath132 breaks down for the nucleon form factors .",
    "in fact there is a strong indication that for the nucleons , @xmath103 is a good approximation , as suggested a long time ago@xcite based on phenomenological considerations and confirmed by new data from jlab .",
    "how the violation of vd in the nucleon form factors comes about was first explained years ago in terms of a chiral bag model  @xcite . in chiral bag model , the electromagnetic form factors have two sources : one is the contribution from the weakly interacting free quarks confined within a bag and the other is from the pion cloud outside of the bag , with the two regions connected by chiral - invariant boundary conditions .",
    "the partition into two regions is characterized by the chiral angle @xmath133 . at the  magic angle",
    "\" @xmath134 , one has one unit of baryon charge partitioned equally inside and outside of the bag .",
    "the outside pion cloud is assumed to respond to the electromagnetic field via the vector ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) mesons in accord with vd whereas the quarks inside are to respond as a compact core of size @xmath135 fm , i.e. the bag at the magic angle .",
    "this description can be translated into the modern version of effective field theory by constructing baryons as skyrmions in hls  @xcite . in hls",
    ", the photon will couple to the pion cloud weighed by @xmath136 and to the soliton core by @xmath137 & = & -2eag f_^2 a_em^[_q ] + & & + 2ie(1-a/2 ) a_em^[v_q ] where @xmath138 is the photon field , @xmath139 is the quark charge matrix and @xmath140 is the matter vector current . at @xmath55 ,",
    "the coupling is half - and - half .",
    "it was argued at the time  @xcite that this described best the available data on the nucleon form factor .",
    "this picture is very well supported by the recent jlab experiment on the form factor ratio @xmath141 of the proton measured to large momentum transfers  @xcite .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , the @xmath53 approaching 1 may be generic in the presence of matter .",
    "a careful analysis of the rge flow of the hls theory with the vm shows that the vector dominance with @xmath132 at the pion on - shell is an  accident \" on an unstable trajectory , so @xmath53 can be driven away by small external perturbation from the vd point  @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed for hadronic matter in heat bath  @xcite : the vd is predicted to be maximally violated as temperature drives @xmath53 to 1 quickly .",
    "the claim in @xcite is that in hadronic matter , @xmath53 is driven to near 1 .",
    "this has not yet been checked by explicit calculations in hls for baryonic matter .",
    "it could however be checked by experiments .",
    "i propose to generalize this : that _ any system that involves baryons , whether in isolation ( e.g. , nucleon , pentaquark etc . ) or in many - body aggregation ( nuclei , nuclear matter etc . ) , would have @xmath103_. i will apply this proposition to the pentaquark structure .",
    "i am now in a position to discuss what happens to pentaquarks in hls / vm  @xcite .",
    "the main thesis in my discussion is that _ the kaon - skyrmion interaction takes place in a baryonic matter and hence the parameter @xmath53 will be driven away from the vd value of 2 to near 1 of vm_.    let me begin by observing that qualitatively speaking , when vector - meson degrees of freedom are present , there are two important changes that occur in the interaction of the kaon with the @xmath34 soliton .",
    "firstly the strange vector meson @xmath3 couples to the soliton as the kaon does .",
    "thus the fluctuation in the strangeness direction involves a coupled channel problem .",
    "the obvious effect is the level repulsion between @xmath142 and @xmath3 .",
    "a much subtler effect is that the presence of the  light \" mass vector mesons , @xmath19 and @xmath3 , brings in a solitonic matter additional terms that behave like the wess - zumino term in the coupling of @xmath143 .",
    "this may be stated as saying that the  effective magnetic field \" played by the wess - zumino term is modified .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[wz : illust ] .",
    "now with hidden local symmetry , one can show  @xcite that the vector meson mediated graphs cancel each other in the limit of the infinite vector meson mass , leaving the topological wz term which is effectively repulsive for the @xmath1 channel .",
    "however for finite vector meson masses , there are non - local contributions to the total wz - like term which depending upon the value of @xmath53 , can be effectively repulsive or attractive in conjuction with the @xmath147 level repulsion .",
    "a full spectroscopy of the pentaquark states requires collective quantization and the proper account of all @xmath31 terms and @xmath130 corrections .",
    "such a comprehensive calculation has not been done yet . however to see qualitatively what happens to a @xmath1 in the background of the soliton to order @xmath148",
    ", it suffices to study the coupled equations of motion for the @xmath142 and @xmath3 interacting with the soliton . for this purpose",
    ", we need to take the large @xmath10 limit of the hls lagrangian given by the @xmath94 lagrangian obtained at @xmath82 by the wilsonian matching .",
    "as noted , the @xmath94 hls lagrangian obtained in a best fit by hy  @xcite gives @xmath116 ( and other parameters i will not quote ) .",
    "for this lagrangian , the equations of motion give the @xmath1 bound by @xmath149 mev .",
    "if one instead fixes @xmath55 at the matching point and do the best fit for other two parameters , a procedure which was found in @xcite as acceptable as the  best fit , \" the resulting results are in equally good agreement with experiments .",
    "the @xmath1 is also bound in this case , with the binding energy @xmath150 mev .",
    "thus it can be concluded that _ for @xmath151 , the @xmath1 is found to be definitely bound _ although by a small amount  @xcite . to have a more general and qualitative idea as to what is happening",
    ", the  parameter \" @xmath53 is arbitrarily varied with all other parameters fixed to physical ( on - shell ) values .",
    "this procedure is not quite justified for @xmath53 close to 1 since the parameters are correlated by the consistency of the theory but it gives some idea as to how the @xmath1-soliton depends on @xmath53 for @xmath152 .",
    "the result  @xcite is shown in fig.[e - vs - a ] .",
    "what is given is the eigenenergy of the @xmath153 in the soliton background giving the system with @xmath154 , @xmath155 . when the energy is less than the free kaon mass @xmath156 mev , the system is bound .",
    "when @xmath53 goes to infinity , that goes over to the case studied in @xcite , namely , pseudoscalar - only theory .",
    "we see that the @xmath157 states are more or less insensitive to @xmath53 for a wide range of @xmath53  ) spectroscopy to be undramatic .",
    "they failed to look at the @xmath21 channel where the effect is a lot more dramatic . ] but the @xmath4 state is strongly sensitive , with the state bound for @xmath151 and unbound above .",
    "the widths of the unbound states that show up as resonances ( for @xmath158 ) are given by the error bars .",
    "the error bars explode as the eigenenergy increases   and the proton , say , @xmath159 mev , corresponding to @xmath131 for which the vector dominance holds , the width can be @xmath160 mev , clearly too big for the  observed \" @xmath2 . ] .      in order to confront nature",
    ", one would have to calculate the casimir contribution to the masses for the @xmath0 as well as the nucleon and quantize them including terms of @xmath36 .",
    "the coupling of the quantum @xmath0 to the proton - kaon continuum will be at @xmath36 . in the absence of these quantities ,",
    "i can only make a few guesses .",
    "what is known is that if naively collective - quantized with the casimir term ignored , the @xmath0 state ( near @xmath55 ) has a mass @xmath161 lower than the @xmath162 threshold @xmath163 .",
    "the crucial question then is : what happens when other corrections of @xmath28 as well as @xmath36 are included ? here",
    "are a couple of possibilities that one can entertain  @xcite :    one possibility is that after the account of the corrections mentioned above , a genuine bound state of the quantum numbers of @xmath0 hitherto unobserved experimentally remains below the @xmath162 threshold .",
    "in addition , there can be a bound @xmath3-soliton state in the @xmath162 continuum weakly coupled to the latter .",
    "this could be identified as the observed narrow @xmath2 .",
    "another possibility is that higher - order @xmath130 corrections ( starting with @xmath28 ) are more attractive for the nucleon than for the @xmath0 such that the bound  closed \" channel state goes into the @xmath162 continuum . in this case",
    ", the observed peak could be generated as a  feshbach resonance \"  @xcite with a small width due to the weak ( @xmath36 ) @xmath0-@xmath142-@xmath164 coupling .",
    "a possible mechanism is that the baryonic matter of the soliton that dials @xmath53 which in turn controls the wz - like term could play , in the presence of @xmath3 , the role of a magnetic field that makes the coupled systems to sweep across the level - crossing point ( involving the bound @xmath1-soliton and the scattering @xmath162 levels ) , thereby producing a resonance in analogy to resonances in ultracold atoms driven by magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "i have not made any attempt to compare the bound - state formulation based on hls to correlated quark models  @xcite .",
    "a meaningful comparison can be made only when a comprehensive analysis is made of the spectroscopy of all pentaquqak states predicted by the present theory .",
    "what one can say is that when a realistic effective hls lagrangian is obtained from the ads / qcd duality , then the skyrmion description therefrom should be dual to the quark model description",
    ". then the debate as to which picture is correct will be moot .",
    "this issue will be sharpened if and when the @xmath0 state is confirmed experimentally .",
