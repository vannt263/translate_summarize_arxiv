    "we also introduce some of our notation and discuss the main implications as well as explicit renormalization group equations for gravity .      as in any non - trivial quantum field theory , once quantum fluctuations of the propagating field ",

    "however , once energies approach the planck scale , quantum corrections become relevant and the graviton anomalous dimension becomes large @xmath59 . in this regime",
