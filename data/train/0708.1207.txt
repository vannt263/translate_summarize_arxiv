    "<S> we investigate the entanglement entropy between two subsets of particles in the ground state of the calogero - sutherland model . by using the duality relations of the jack symmetric polynomials , we obtain exact expressions for both the reduced density matrix and the entanglement entropy in the limit of an infinite number of particles traced out . from these results , </S>",
