    "with the aim of obtaining a fundamental basis behind the formation of super - chandrasekhar white dwarfs ( wds ) , mukhopadhyay and his collaborators @xcite initiated the exploration of highly magnetized wds and their new mass - limit , significantly exceeding the chandrasekhar limit of @xmath1.@xcite these wds are ideally suited to be the progenitors of peculiar , overluminous , type ia supernovae , e.g. sn  2003fg , sn  2006gz , sn  2007if , sn  2009dc,@xcite which are best explained by invoking the explosion of super - chandrasekhar wds having mass @xmath2 . along with the fact that several wds have been discovered with surface fields @xmath3 g , it has also been known that magnetized wds tend to be more massive than their non - magnetized counterparts.@xcite such observations motivate the theoretical investigation of the effect of a strong interior magnetic field on the mass of a wd .    in this context",
    ", we mention that our previous attempts at obtaining highly magnetized super - chandrasekhar wds , assumed _ a priori _ spherical symmetry .",
    "while that may indeed be the case for certain magnetic field geometries , in general , highly magnetized wds tend to be deformed due to magnetic tension . with each new step",
    "we have scientifically progressed towards a more rigorous model  starting from a simplistic newtonian , spherically symmetric , constant field model and culminating in a model with self - consistent departure from spherical symmetry by general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) formulation , which we explain in the present work ( also , see ref .",
    "we appropriately modify the _ xns _",
    "code,@xcite which has so far been used only to model strongly magnetized neutron stars , to compute equilibrium configurations of static , strongly magnetized wds in the gr framework , for the first time in the literature to the best of our knowledge .",
    "for a detailed description of the underlying grmhd equations , the magnetic field geometries , the numerical technique employed by the _",
    "xns _ code and the values of various code parameters ,",
    "we refer the readers to refs .",
    "we construct axisymmetric wds in spherical polar coordinates @xmath4 , to self - consistently account for the deviation from spherical symmetry due to a strong magnetic field , which generates an anisotropy in the magnetic pressure.@xcite a uniform computational grid is used along both the radial @xmath5 and polar @xmath6 co - ordinates , the number of grid points being typically @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "even higher resolution runs ( for e.g. with @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) require more computational time but do not lead to any significant change in the results .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the equilibrium solutions of high density , magnetized , relativistic wds , which can be described by a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the pressure and @xmath13 the density , such that the adiabatic index @xmath14 and the constant @xmath15 is same as that obtained by chandrasekhar.@xcite hence , we neglect the possible effect of landau quantization on the above eos which could arise due to a strong magnetic field @xmath16 , where @xmath17 g , is the critical magnetic field.@xcite we recall that the maximum number of landau levels @xmath18 occupied by electrons in the presence of a magnetic field is given by equation ( 10 ) of ref .",
    "1 . the range of central density and maximum magnetic field strength inside the wds considered in this work are @xmath19 gm/@xmath20 and @xmath21 g respectively . consequently , @xmath22 for this range of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which is large enough not to significantly modify the value of @xmath25 we choose , hence justifying our assumption .",
    "we now explore the effect of various magnetic field geometries on the structure and properties of wds . for a fiducial model , we choose a non - magnetized wd with @xmath26 gm/@xmath20 .",
    "it has a baryonic mass @xmath27 and equatorial radius @xmath28 km , and is perfectly spherical with @xmath29 , @xmath30 being the polar radius ( note that for the definitions of all global physical quantities characterizing the solutions in this work , we refer to appendix b of ref . 13 ) .",
    "# 1    ( # 1 )    figures [ poltor](a ) and ( c ) portray the distribution of baryonic density and magnetic field strength respectively , for the fiducial wd having a purely toroidal magnetic field configuration @xmath31 .",
    "the maximum magnetic field strength inside this wd is @xmath32 g. interestingly , this is a highly super - chandrasekhar wd , having @xmath33 .",
    "note that the value of the surface magnetic field does not affect this result , as long as it is @xmath34 g , which is satisfied in this case . in this context , we mention that the detection of very high surface magnetic fields @xmath35 g is very difficult due to the featureless spectrum.@xcite very importantly , the ratio of the total magnetic energy to the total gravitational binding energy , @xmath36 ( which is much @xmath37 ) . wds with even smaller @xmath38 are also found to be highly super - chandrasekhar ( see figs .",
    "[ rhocf]a and d ) .",
    "this argues for the wds to be stable ( see , e.g. ref .",
    ". the radii ratio , @xmath39 ( which is slightly @xmath40 ) , indicates a net prolate deformation in the shape caused due to a toroidal field geometry .",
    "figure [ poltor](a ) shows that although the central iso - density contours are compressed into a highly prolate structure , the outer layers expand , giving rise to an overall quasi - spherical shape .",
    "interestingly , this justifies the earlier spherically symmetric assumption in computing models of at least certain strongly magnetized wds.@xcite    figures [ poltor](b ) and ( d ) show the distribution of baryonic density and magnetic field strength superimposed by magnetic field lines respectively , for the fiducial wd having a purely poloidal magnetic field configuration @xmath41 .",
    "the maximum magnetic field strength attained at its center is @xmath42 g , which also leads to a significantly super - chandrasekhar wd having @xmath43 .",
    "the wd is highly deformed with an overall oblate shape and @xmath44 , which is expected to be stable because its @xmath45 , which is very much @xmath37.@xcite    # 1    ( # 1 )    purely toroidal and poloidal field configurations are believed to be subjected to mhd instabilities,@xcite which possibly rearranges the field into a mixed configuration.@xcite hence , for completeness , we also construct equilibrium models of wds with a mixed magnetic field configuration . in figure [ mixed ]",
    ", we present the results for the fiducial wd having the so - called _ twisted torus configuration _",
    ", which compares the distribution of the toroidal and poloidal components of the magnetic field .",
    "this again results in a significantly super - chandrasekhar wd having @xmath46 .",
    "the poloidal component attains @xmath47 g at the center , while the ring - like toroidal component is an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the wd assumes a highly oblate shape with @xmath48 , resembling the purely poloidal case in all its attributes , and is again expected to be stable having @xmath49 . in a toroidal dominated mixed field configuration,@xcite more massive super - chandrasekhar wds could be possible and is worth further exploration . in this context , we mention that the results in this work have also been reproduced by bera & bhattacharya,@xcite albeit without any novel contribution to the topic .",
    "we also construct equilibrium sequences of magnetized wds pertaining to different field geometries for the fiducial case with @xmath26 gm/@xmath20 .",
    "figure [ rhocf ] shows the variations of different physical quantities as functions of @xmath24 .",
    "the two most important revelations of figure [ rhocf ] are  ( 1 ) the wd mass increases with an increase in magnetic field for all the three field configurations discussed above ( see figure [ rhocf]a ) , eventually leading to highly super - chandrasekhar wds and ( 2 ) the magnetic energy remains ( significantly ) sub - dominant compared to the gravitational binding energy for all the cases , since @xmath50 always ( see figure [ rhocf]d ) , which argues for the possible existence of stable , highly magnetized super - chandrasekhar wds .",
    "gm/@xmath20 . ( a )",
    "@xmath51 , ( b ) @xmath52 , ( c ) @xmath53 and ( d ) @xmath38 , as functions of @xmath24 .",
    "the solid ( green ) , dotted ( blue ) and dashed ( red ) curves represent , respectively , wds having purely poloidal , purely toroidal , and twisted torus field configurations .",
    "@xmath51 is in units of @xmath54 .",
    "the filled boxes represent individual wds.,width=528 ]",
    "since our foray into this topic , we have been persistent with our message that the versatile nature of magnetic field is paramount in the revelation of significantly super - chandrasekhar wds , irrespective of its nature of origin : quantum , classical and/or general relativistic  which is re - emphasized in the present work .    by carrying out extensive , self - consistent , grmhd numerical analysis of magnetized wds",
    ", we have reestablished the existence of highly super - chandrasekhar , stable wds . in order to self - consistently study the anisotropic effect of a strong magnetic field , we have explored various geometrical field configurations , namely , purely toroidal , purely poloidal and twisted torus configurations .",
    "interestingly , we have obtained significantly super - chandrasekhar magnetized wds for all the cases , having mass @xmath55 , and that too at relatively lower magnetic field strengths when the deviation from spherical symmetry is considered  as already speculated in our earlier work.@xcite these wds can be ideal progenitors of the aforementioned peculiar , overluminous type ia supernovae .",
    "our work also establishes the necessity of a general relativistic formalism over a newtonian approach while constructing models of magnetized super - chandrasekhar wds .",
