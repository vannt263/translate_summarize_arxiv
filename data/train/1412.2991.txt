    "dibaryons ( as compact six - quark systems or as bound states formed by two conventional octet and/or decuplet baryons ) have been intriguing objects of investigations and speculations for many years . while in the purely nucleonic case there is yet again a promising dibaryon candidate @xcite , besides the deuteron , there are indications that the strangeness sector could be specifically rewarding for finding dibaryons @xcite . here",
    "the by far best - known example is certainly the @xmath10-dibaryon suggested by jaffe @xcite , a deeply bound state with quantum numbers of the @xmath11 system , i.e. strangeness @xmath4 and isospin @xmath12 , and with @xmath13 .",
    "there are also speculations about the existence of other exotic states , notably in the @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) @xcite and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) @xcite systems , see also refs .",
    "@xcite .    with regard to two octet baryons , the ( approximate ) su(3 )",
    "flavor symmetry of the strong interaction suggests that bound states could exist for systems with strangeness @xmath14 and , in particular , @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "indeed , meson - exchange models like the nijmegen baryon - baryon ( @xmath19 ) interaction @xcite , derived under the assumption of ( broken ) su(3 ) symmetry , predict interactions for the @xmath14 and @xmath20 sectors that are fairly strong and attractive and lead to bound states in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels @xcite .",
    "the situation is somewhat different for @xmath19 interactions derived in the constituent quark model by fujiwara and collaborators @xcite .",
    "while su(3 ) flavor symmetry plays likewise a key role in extending the model from the @xmath3 and @xmath21 interaction ( where free parameters are fixed ) to the @xmath14 and @xmath20 channels , in this approach it was found that the @xmath19 interaction becomes step by step less attractive when going from strangeness @xmath7 to @xmath18 . in particular , no dibaryon bound states are supported , except for the deuteron .",
    "a similar pattern was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite where the intermediate - range attraction from the scalar - isoscalar ( `` @xmath22 '' ) channel was evaluated within a model for correlated @xmath23 and @xmath24 exchange between octet baryons . also in this case it was found that the attraction between two baryons , quantified by the effective @xmath22-meson coupling strength , decreases step by step in the strangeness sector .",
    "results obtained in lattice qcd calculations are conflicting so far .",
    "while a @xmath9 bound state was found by the nplqcd collaboration  @xcite ( in the @xmath0 state ) , the hal qcd collaboration reported only a moderately attractive interaction for that partial wave @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we examine the existence of @xmath5 , @xmath25 and @xmath9 bound states in the framework of su(3 ) chiral effective field theory ( eft ) . in particular , we explore the role of su(3 ) symmetry breaking contact terms that arise at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the perturbative expansion of the baryon - baryon potential .",
    "a first study of the baryon - baryon ( @xmath19 ) interactions within chiral eft @xcite in the weinberg scheme @xcite for the strangeness @xmath4 , @xmath26 and @xmath20 sectors was presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . at leading - order ( lo ) considered in those works the chiral potentials consist of contact terms without derivatives and of one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 )",
    ". assuming @xmath30 flavor symmetry those contact terms and the couplings of the pseudoscalar mesons to the baryons can be related to the corresponding quantities of the @xmath31 hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath21 ) channels .",
    "specifically , the values of the pertinent five low - energy constants ( lecs ) related to the contact terms could be fixed from the study of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 systems @xcite and then genuine predictions for the @xmath34 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 interactions could be made at lo .",
    "strong attraction was found in some of the @xmath4 , @xmath26 and @xmath20 @xmath19 channels , and several bound states were predicted @xcite .",
    "recently , a @xmath21 interaction has been derived up to nlo in chiral eft by the jlich - bonn - munich group @xcite . at that order contact terms leading to an explicit su(3 ) symmetry breaking appear for the first time @xcite as mentioned above .",
    "since the sparse experimental information on @xmath32 and @xmath33 scattering could be described rather well with using the su(3 ) symmetric terms alone , su(3 ) symmetry breaking was simply neglected . in other words",
    "it was assumed that the lecs associated with those contact terms are zero .",
    "thus , in the actual calculation the su(3 ) symmetry is only broken via the employed physical masses of the involved mesons and octet baryons ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) .",
    "on the other hand , it was also found in ref .",
    "@xcite that a simultaneous description of the @xmath21 data and the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) phase shifts is not possible on the basis of su(3 ) symmetric contact terms . in particular , the strengths needed for reproducing the @xmath1 ( or @xmath39 ) @xmath0 phase shifts and the @xmath2 cross section could not be reconciled in a scenario which maintained su(3 ) symmetry for the contact terms .",
    "this observation is the starting point for the present study , because it can be used to put constraints on the su(3 ) symmetry breaking contact terms . in particular , the situation in the @xmath0 partial wave and for @xmath19 channels with maximal isospin is rather simple and interesting . here , there are only two independent su(3 ) symmetry breaking lecs at nlo for five physical channels , and for three of those five channels bound states have been predicted in the past .",
    "the aforementioned @xmath1 phase shifts and the @xmath2 cross section allow us to pin down one of the symmetry breaking lecs and provide a clear - cut indication for the decrease of attraction when one goes from the @xmath3 system to @xmath4 , so that a bound state for @xmath5 with isospin @xmath6 can be practically ruled out .",
    "the other lec can not be determined at present and several options for its value are discussed .",
    "however , already the assumption that the trend one sees for @xmath7 to @xmath4 is not reversed when going to @xmath14 and @xmath18 makes bound states in the latter systems rather unlikely .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way : in sect .",
    "2 we provide a basic introduction to our @xmath19 interaction derived in chiral eft .",
    "we also discuss the changes that arise in the interaction when the su(3 ) symmetry breaking contact terms are taken into account .",
    "selected results for @xmath19 systems with strangeness @xmath4 to @xmath18 based on su(3 ) symmetric contact terms fixed in a fit to @xmath21 data are presented in sect .",
    "3 . in sect .",
    "4 we introduce the su(3 ) symmetry breaking contact terms and show the implications for the @xmath0 phase shift in the @xmath5 , @xmath25 , and @xmath9 channels with maximal isospin .",
    "the paper ends with a short summary .",
    "some technical information about our calculation is given in appendix a.",
    "a comprehensive description of the derivation of the chiral @xmath19 potentials for the strangeness sector using the weinberg power counting can be found in refs .",
    "the lo potential consists of four - baryon contact terms without derivatives and of one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges while at nlo contact terms with two derivatives arise , together with contributions from ( irreducible ) two - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges .",
    "the interaction in ref .",
    "@xcite was derived by imposing su(3 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "then the contributions from pseudoscalar - meson exchanges ( @xmath27 , @xmath29 , @xmath28 ) are completely fixed in terms of the axial coupling @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the so - called @xmath42 ratio , together with the pion decay constant @xmath43 .",
    "su(3 ) symmetry was also imposed for the contact terms .",
    "since the strength parameters associated with the contact terms , the lecs , need to be determined by a fit to data , it was tried to keep the number of independent lecs that can contribute as small as possible . in the su(3 ) symmetric case there are in total 13 lecs entering the @xmath44-waves and the @xmath44@xmath45 transitions of the @xmath46@xmath47 system @xcite , and their values could be fairly well fixed in a fit to the available low - energy total cross sections for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "however , it would have been not possible to determine the additional 5 contact terms appearing at nlo that lead to an explicit su(3 ) symmetry breaking , cf .",
    "the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite and also ref .",
    "@xcite , and , therefore , the corresponding lecs were simply set to zero .    at the same time",
    ", it became already clear in ref .",
    "@xcite that it is impossible to obtain a combined fit to the @xmath21 data and to the @xmath3 phase shifts with lecs that fulfill su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the most obvious case is the @xmath0 partial wave , where su(3 ) symmetry implies that the interactions in the @xmath3 ( i=1 ) and @xmath33 ( i=3/2 ) channels involve the very same two lecs and are given simply by @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 being the center - of - mass momenta in the initial and final state .",
    "the label @xmath56 indicates that both channels belong to the @xmath56 representation of su(3 ) @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed description of the notation . indeed",
    ", strict su(3 ) symmetry suggests that the @xmath0 contact interaction should be the same for several @xmath19 channels that belong solely to the @xmath56 : @xmath57    eq .",
    "( [ lecsu3 ] ) implies that under the assumption of su(3 ) symmetry the ( hadronic part of the ) interaction in the @xmath58 or @xmath2 channels is unambiguously fixed once the lecs are determined from the @xmath39 or @xmath1 phases , or vice versa . in practice",
    "it turned out that with lecs fixed from the @xmath39 ( or @xmath1 ) phase shifts a near - threshold bound state is generated in the @xmath2 system and , as a consequence , the empirical @xmath2 cross section is grossly overestimated @xcite .",
    "evidently , su(3 ) symmetry breaking in the contact terms has to be taken into account if one wants to describe @xmath3 and @xmath47 scattering simultaneously .",
    "the contact terms , including the su(3 ) symmetry breaking corrections that arise at nlo , have been worked out explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite for all octet @xmath19 channels from strangeness @xmath7 to @xmath20 .",
    "there are twelve independent su(3 ) symmetry breaking lecs in total , see ref .",
    "@xcite , of which six occur in the @xmath0 partial wave and the other six in the @xmath59 .",
    "it is impossible to determine all of those based on the presently available experimental information in the strangeness @xmath31 to @xmath20 sectors .",
    "the situation is more favorable , however , in the particular case discussed above , namely for the @xmath0 partial wave and @xmath19 channels with maximal isospin .",
    "here one obtains @xmath60 evidently , there are only two additional lecs due to su(3 ) symmetry breaking , which are denoted by @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the above equations",
    ". as expected , their contributions are proportional to the meson mass difference , @xmath63 , so that they vanish in case of su(3 ) symmetry , i.e. when @xmath64 .",
    "there are also contact terms proportional to @xmath65 and @xmath66 which are , however , su(3 ) symmetric and have been absorbed into the definition of @xmath67 @xcite",
    ". a combined fit to the @xmath1 ( or @xmath39 ) @xmath0 phase shifts and the @xmath68 cross section allows us to determine three of the four lecs in eq .",
    "( [ lec ] ) , as will be demonstrated below",
    ". then we can make genuine predictions for the @xmath5 interaction with isospin @xmath6 .",
    "the fourth lec ( @xmath62 ) can not be pinned down reliably at present . in this case",
    "we will consider a range of values and study the consequences for the possible existence of @xmath25 and @xmath9 bound states .    for completeness let us mention that our calculations are done in momentum space .",
    "we solve the partial - wave projected ( non  relativistic ) lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation ,    @xmath69    for a particular @xmath19 channel .",
    "here , @xmath70 is the reduced mass and @xmath71 is the on - shell momentum , which is defined by @xmath72 .",
    "relativistic kinematics is used for relating the laboratory momentum @xmath73 of the baryons to the center - of - mass momentum . in case of @xmath1 and @xmath74 , where we compare with experiments ,",
    "the coulomb interaction is included .",
    "this is done via the vincent - phatak method @xcite .",
    "the potentials in the ls equation are cut off with a regulator function , @xmath75 $ ] , in order to remove high - energy components @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite results for cutoff values in the range @xmath76  @xmath77mev were shown and we will consider the same range here .",
    "the variation of the results with the cutoff can be viewed as a rough estimate for the theoretical uncertainty @xcite . a better method to determine",
    "the theoretical uncertainty has recently been proposed for the @xmath3 sector @xcite , but in view of the scarce data in the strangeness sector and given the exploratory character of our study , we stick to the much simpler procedure of varying the cutoff .",
    "note that for all the systems listed in eq .",
    "( [ lec ] ) there is no coupling to other partial waves or channels .",
    "thus , differences in the reaction thresholds that generate an additional su(3 ) symmetry breaking in the scattering amplitude when the ls equation ( [ lse ] ) is solved for coupled channels , are absent .",
    "this makes those systems especially suited for isolating su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects in the potential .",

    "[ fig : nn ] , see the filled circles . obviously for our eft interaction @xcite ( but also for most of the @xmath21 potentials based on meson exchange @xcite ) the predicted @xmath0 amplitude is very close to saturating the @xmath2 cross section alone . the hatched band in fig .  [ fig : nn ] indicates the predictions one would get for the @xmath2 channel with the lecs fitted to the @xmath1 @xmath0 phase shifts . evidently , the assumption of su(3 ) symmetry for the contact terms is in clear contradiction with the experimental information .",
    "note that there is also a phase shift analysis for @xmath2 @xcite at a single momentum , namely @xmath80 mev / c , which suggests a value of around 26 degrees for the @xmath0 partial wave .",
    "however , that analysis is not model independent and",
    ", therefore , we have more confidence in our own results determined by a fit to existing @xmath21 data within chiral eft .",
    "once we have determined @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath61 from our fit to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath0 phase shifts , we can make predictions for the @xmath83 case , see eq .",

    "@xmath89 ( hatched band ) the only su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects in the potential ( as compared to @xmath5 ) come from the one- and two - meson exchange contributions .",
    "one notices a clear increase in the attraction for @xmath93 and @xmath9 in comparison to the @xmath83 results , cf .",
    "[ fig : ss ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : xx ] .",
    "specifically , for @xmath9 the phase shifts reach almost 60 degrees , i.e. similar values as in the @xmath1 system . introducing an explicit su(3 ) symmetry breaking in the contact terms",
    "leads to the results represented by the filled bands ( @xmath92 ) and dotted bands ( @xmath91 ) , respectively .",
    "now the predicted phase shifts for the @xmath0 partial wave are much smaller and especially in the @xmath9 case the reduction is drastic .",
    "the scattering length for the @xmath8 channel are in the range of @xmath96 to @xmath97 fm for the choice @xmath89 , but reduce to @xmath98 to @xmath99 fm for @xmath92 , and to @xmath100 to @xmath101 fm for @xmath91 .",
    "for @xmath9 we obtain @xmath102 to @xmath103 fm , @xmath104 to @xmath99 fm , and @xmath105 fm , respectively .",
    "we have also performed calculations based on the @xmath39 @xmath0 phase shifts as starting point instead of the @xmath1 values . in this case",
    "there is a somewhat stronger su(3 ) symmetry breaking between @xmath39 and @xmath74 and , accordingly , the resulting @xmath5 , @xmath25 and @xmath9 phase shifts are then reduced by roughly 10 % as compared to the ones presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : nn ] , [ fig : ss ] and [ fig : xx ] .",
    "there are results for the @xmath9 @xmath0 partial wave from lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the ones reported by the nplqcd collaboration @xcite suggest a bound state with @xmath106 = -14.0 @xmath107 1.4 @xmath107 6.7 mev .",
    "the calculation was performed for a pion mass of @xmath108 389 mev and for @xmath109 1349.6 mev .",
    "in contrast , no bound state was found by the hal qcd collaboration @xcite . in this calculation , that corresponds to @xmath108 510 mev and @xmath109 1456 mev , the interaction in the @xmath0 partial wave is only moderately attractive and the phase shifts rise only to a maximum of around 20@xmath10710 degrees .",
    "interestingly , the eft predictions based on the choice @xmath92 are fairly close to those results . our investigations in refs .",
    "@xcite suggest that the actual value of the pion mass does not play an important role in the @xmath9 system and , therefore , we do not expect sizable changes in the lattice results once calculations for masses closer to the physical value become feasible .",
    "the @xmath38 mass is only marginally larger than the physical mass ( which is about 1320 mev ) in case of the nplqcd collaboration so that it should not distort the results . in any case",
    ", a smaller baryon mass would rather lead to a reduction of the attraction than to an enhancement , cf .",
    "the discussion below .",
    "finally , let us comment on the role played by the su(3 ) symmetry breaking in the baryon masses . as mentioned in sect .",
    "2 , the baryon masses enter solely in the course of solving the ls equation  ( [ lse ] ) .",
    "contributions to the potential involving the baryon masses occur only at higher order in the employed power counting scheme @xcite .",
    "in fact , this appearance of the reduced @xmath19 mass in the ls equation is the key point in the argument exploited by miller @xcite in his exploration of possible @xmath9 bound states .",
    "his argument is easy to understand in terms of the schrdinger equation , @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the wave function . if su(3 ) symmetry is approximately fulfilled then @xmath112 .",
    "however , since the physical mass of @xmath38 is significantly larger than the one of the nucleon , the effective strength of the interaction is increased when it is multiplied with the appropriate reduced mass @xmath70 .",
    "for example , for @xmath9 one has @xmath113 , i.e. there is a 40 % increase in the effective strength of the interaction as compared to @xmath3 , while for @xmath83 one gets @xmath114 .",
    "for attractive potentials this has a drastic effect and leads to bound states with increasing baryon masses as demonstrated in the work of miller for simple potential models .",
    "clearly , the same mechanism is also responsible for the @xmath9 , etc .",
    "bound states that one observes in meson - exchange potentials and in our eft interactions when su(3 ) symmetry is assumed in extrapolating to the strangeness @xmath88 and @xmath20 @xmath19 systems . indeed , the increase in the phase shift from @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ss ] ) to @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xx ] ) in the scenario with @xmath89 reported above is primarily dictated by the increase in the corresponding reduced masses .",
    "the actual @xmath1 and @xmath2 phase shifts suggest that there is no such net increase in the attraction when going to the strangeness sector .",
    "thus , in practice the su(3 ) symmetry breaking lec @xmath61 ( more than ) compensates effectively the impact of the increase in the reduced mass . indeed , the stepwise modification of the contact interaction due to the su(3 ) symmetry breaking terms that follows from chiral eft , cf .",
    "( [ lec ] ) , is paralleled by a similar stepwise increase in the reduced mass when going from @xmath3 to @xmath47 to @xmath5 , say .",
    "thus , since the mass splitting between @xmath37 and @xmath38 is significantly smaller than the one between nucleon and @xmath37 , @xmath115 mev versus @xmath116 mev , one could speculate that the magnitude of the `` compensating '' su(3 ) symmetry breaking lec ( @xmath117 ) is likewise reduced .",
    "if that is so , adopting @xmath92 might be a reasonable choice . in any case , we believe that a realistical estimation for @xmath62 might be provided by @xmath118 .",
    "but it is obvious from our results that for any value @xmath119 the bound states that we find in the @xmath83 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 systems for interactions with su(3 ) symmetric contact terms ( cf .",

    "3 ) disappear .",
    "in the present paper we examined the question whether baryon - baryon bound states in the strangeness sector could exist in the framework of chiral effective field theory .",
