    "@xcite the best modeling approach for design and analysis of nanoscale mosfets is presently unclear , though a straightforward application of semiclassical methods that disregards quantum mechanical effects is generally accepted to be inadequate .",
    "quantum mechanical modeling of mosfets with channel lengths in the tens of nanometers is important for many reasons :    \\(i ) mosfets with ultrathin oxide require an accurate treatment of current injection from source , drain and gate .",

    "\\(ii ) ballistic flow of electrons across the channel becomes increasingly important as the channel length decreases .",

    "\\(iv ) approximate theories of quantum effects included in semi - classical mosfet modeling tools are desirable from practical considerations because semi - classical methods are numerically less expensive , and much of the empirical and semi - classical mosfet physics developed over the last few decades continues to hold true in many regions of a nanoscale mosfet",
    ". examples of semiclassical methods that consider some quantum mechanical aspects are the density gradient ,  @xcite and effective potential  @xcite approaches , and quantum mechanical approximations used in the medici package .",
    "@xcite fully quantum mechanical simulations can play an important role in benchmarking such simulators .",
    "central to quantum mechanical approaches to charge transport modeling is self - consistent solution of a wave equation to describe the quantum mechanical transport , poisson s equation , and equations for statistics of the particle ensemble . in the absence of electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions ( state of the scatterer",
    "does not change ) , the landauer - buttiker formalism  @xcite is applicable . in this formalism , the wave equation is schrodinger s equation and the statistics is represented throughout the device by the fermi - dirac distribution of particles incident from the contacts ( source , drain and gate ) . in the presence of electron - phonon interaction , the wigner function ( wf ) and non equilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalisms are used .",
    "the negf approach has been quite successful in modeling steady state transport in a wide variety of one dimensional ( 1d ) semiconductor structures .",
    "@xcite    a number of groups have started developing theory and simulation for fully quantum mechanical _ two dimensional _ simulation of mosfets using the : real space approach ,  @xcite k - space approach ,  @xcite wigner function approach ,  @xcite and non equilibrium green s function approach .",
    "@xcite others groups have taken a hybrid approach using the monte carlo method .",
    "the monte carlo approach , has been quite successful in describing scattering mechanisms in mosfets , in comparison to fully quantum mechanical approaches , and can also include ballistic effects and the role of quantized energy levels in the mosfet inversion layer in an approximate manner .",
    "@xcite discussing the relative merits of various approaches and quantum - corrected drift - diffusion approaches is important .",
    "in fact , such a comparison of methods using standard device structures has been initiated  @xcite but much work remains to be done in comparing and studying the suitability of different methods .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to describe development of a particular approach , namely the negf approach , for numerical simulation of mosfets with two dimensional ( 2d ) doping profiles and charge injection from the source , drain and gate contacts .",
    "2d simulation significantly increases computational effort over the 1d case .",
    "non - uniform spatial grids are essential to limit the total number of grid points while at the same time resolving physical features . a new algorithm for efficient computation of electron density without complete solution of the system of equations is presented .",
    "the computer code developed is used to calculate the drain and gate tunneling current in ultra short channel mosfets .",
    "results from our approach and medici are compared .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : formalism ( section [ section : formalism ] ) , role of polysilicon gate depletion [ subsection : poly ] , slopes of @xmath1 versus the gate ( @xmath2 ) and drain ( @xmath3 ) voltages ( sections [ subsection : poly ] - [ subsection : idvsvd ] ) , role of anisotropic effective mass ( section [ subsection : effecmass ] ) , role of gate tunneling current as a function of gate oxide thickness and gate length in determining the off current ( section [ subsection : gateleakage ] ) .",

    "the influence of bandgap narrowing has been neglected here .",
    "it must be mentioned that the bandgap narrowing effect will tend to make the quantum mechanical contribution to the polysilicon band bending just discussed smaller .",

    "computationally , a 2d treatment of the polysilicon gate region is expensive because of the additional grid points required .",
    "note that matrix inversion depends on the cube of the matrix dimension .",
    "we point out that for highly doped polysilicon gate ( in the absence of gate tunneling ) , a shift in the @xmath156 curve from ( i ) by the equilibrium 1d built - in potential does a reasonable job of reproducing the quantum mechanical result ( see triangles in fig .",

    "@xcite this subband dependent source injection barrier is simply the maximum energy of the subband between source and drain due to quantization in the direction perpendicular to the gate plane ( x - direction of fig .",

    "the following two issues are important in ballistic mosfets : ( a ) typically , the total transmission assumes integer value at an energy slightly above the maximum in 2d density of states as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : dosandtvsebw ] , and ( b ) the steps develop over 50 mev ( twice the room temperature thermal energy ) .",
    "so , the shape of the steps is important in determining the value of current . assuming a sharp step in total transmission with integer values in a calculation of current as in reference is not quite accurate .",
    "we compare the results from our quantum simulations with published results from quantum - corrected medici .",

    "@xmath165 is a prefactor chosen to reproduce the current at @xmath166 in fig .",

    "this match is rationalized by noting that for the values of gate biases considered , @xmath161 is well above the source fermi energy and @xmath167 is many kt ( thermal energy ) above @xmath161 . the difference in slope between the classical and quantum results",
    "can be understood from the slower variation of @xmath161 in comparison to @xmath162 as a function of @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ebervsvg ] ) .",
    "we also find that the decrease of @xmath161 with increases in gate voltage is slower than the barrier height determined from the quantum potential profiles .",
    "this arises because ( neglecting 2d effects ) @xmath161 is determined by a triangular well ( whose apex is the conduction band ) that becomes progressively narrower with increase in gate voltage .    *",

    "the drive current ( @xmath172 ) calculated using q1 with the polysilicon region treated in the flat band and q - poly approximations is more than 100% and 200% larger than the results in reference .",
    "@xmath171 in the linear region is up to three times larger in q1 .",
    "the subthreshold drain current is smaller in q1 .",
    "we however expect that with decreasing channel length , the sub threshold @xmath1 will become larger than the medici results due to quantum mechanical tunneling .",
    "@xcite      the primary influence of anisotropic effective mass is to influence the energy of the subbands in the inversion layer .",
    "valleys with the largest effective mass perpendicular to the oxide ( 0.98@xmath173 ) have subband energies that are smaller than the isotropic effective mass case .",
    "we see from the plot of transmission versus energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dosandtvsebw13b ] ) that the valleys with ( @xmath174 , @xmath175 ) have resonance levels that are more than 50mev lower in energy than the isotropic effective mass case .",
    "the corresponding subthreshold current ( fig .",
    "[ fig : idvsvg_1b_1bp_3b_3bp ] ) is a few hundred percent larger than the value obtained from the isotropic effective mass case .",

    "the drive current ( fig .",
    "[ fig : idvsvg_1b_1bp_3b_3bp ] ) from the anisotropic effective mass case is more than twenty five percent larger than the isotropic effective mass case .",
    "note that for large gate voltages the dependence of current on @xmath161 is sub exponential .",
    "we are not aware of any calculations that compare the relative importance of the current carrying capacity of electrons in the three inequivalent valleys .",
    "we find that the valley with the largest @xmath177 ( = 0.98@xmath173 ) carries 89.22 % and 79.77 % of the current at @xmath2 equal to 0 and 1v respectively ( @xmath178v ) .",
    "thus all three valleys are necessary for an accurate calculation of the ballistic current .",
    "a major problem in mosfets with ultra thin oxides is that tunneling from gate to drain will determine the off current . the gate leakage current versus y is plotted for the mit25 device in fig . [ fig : igvsyallpoly ] .",
    "note that while we use a value of @xmath179 for the dielectric constant of sio@xmath137 , a value of 3.9 does not change the qualitative conclusions . at @xmath166v and @xmath178v ,",

    "[ fig : igvsyallpoly ] ( a ) . at non zero @xmath2",
    ", there is also an appreciable tunneling from the highly doped n@xmath180 regions near the source to the polysilicon region on top of the gate ( fig .",

    ", gate tunneling increases the off current by about two orders of magnitude , and for smaller oxide thicknesses , the gate leakage current is significantly larger .",
    "we propose that the gate leakage current can be reduced by a factor of 10 - 100 without significantly compromising the drive current .",
    "the drive current in these ultra small mosfets is primarily determined by the source injection barrier , or more correctly as discussed earlier by the resonant level at the source injection barrier .",
    "so any changes that result in a reduction of the gate leakage current should not significantly alter the location of the resonant level at the source injection barrier ( and hence the drive current ) .",
    "two methods ( without regard to fabrication issues ) that help in this direction are discussed below :    \\(i ) _ shorter or asymmetric polysilicon gate region _ : we propose that the gate leakage current can be significantly reduced by using shorter gate lengths .",
    "the main feature of the shorter gate lengths is a small overlap between the polysilicon gate and the n@xmath180 region near the drain .",
    "this is pictorially represented in figs .",
    "[ fig : oxide ] ( a ) and ( b ) with long and short gate lengths . to simulate the long and short gate lengths",
    ", we consider the doping profile of mit25 with @xmath182 25 nm and 50 nm ( gate length in reference ) .",
    "the off current and gate leakage current are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : idvstox ] .",
    "we see that the gate leakage current reduces by more than an order of magnitude , and the drive current is within two percent of the @xmath182 50 nm case , as desired ( see inset of fig . [",

    "the spatial profile of gate leakage current for @xmath182 25 nm is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : igvsyallpoly ] ( b ) . though the gate leakage current reduces significantly , a drawback of this scheme is the requirement for very short ( approximately equal to the distance between highly doped region near source and drain ) polysilicon gate lengths .",
    "a polysilicon gate placed asymmetrically with respect to y=0 such that its overlap with the n@xmath180 regions near the drain is small , will also serve to reduce the off current without compromising the drive current .",
    "\\(ii ) _ graded oxide _ :",
    "the second proposal is to use a graded oxide , which is thinner close to the source end and thicker close to the drain end ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oxide ] ( c ) ) .",
    "the thinner oxide near the source is not expected to alter the source injection barrier significantly , while the tunneling rate from gate to drain will be significantly smaller because of the thicker oxide in the drain - gate overlap region .",
    "we consider an oxide that is 1.5 nm thick for y @xmath183 + 10 nm and 2.5 nm for y @xmath184 11 nm , with the thickness varying linearly in between .",
    "the polysilicon gate lengths is 50 nm .",
    "comparison of this device to the original mit25 with an uniform oxide and @xmath185 nm show that while the gate leakage current decreases by one order of magnitude , the drive current decreases by only 30 % .",
    "further optimization of this device structure could yield a larger drive current , while keeping the gate leakage current small .",
    "a modeling framework and computer code to calculate properties of ballistic mosfets with open boundaries at the source , drain and gate contacts have been developed .",
    "this includes an algorithm to compute the electron density using the negf equations that avoids solving for the entire @xmath8 matrix even in the presence of non zero self energies throughout the device .",
    "note that the simulations presented are 2d in nature and also involve self - consistency . as a result , they were numerically intensive and were typically performed on sixteen to sixty four processors of an sgi origin machine .",
    "the main results of this study are :    \\(a ) polysilicon gate depletion causes the conduction band close to the oxide interface to bend in a manner opposite to the semi - classical case ( fig .",
    "this causes a substantial shift in the location of the conduction band bottom in the channel , which gives rise to drain currents that are different from the semiclassical case by one to two orders of magnitude . performing quantum mechanical calculations with a flat polysilicon region , and then shifting the gate voltage axis ( in @xmath1 versus @xmath2 ) by the quantum mechanical built - in voltage shown in fig .",
    "2 results in an order of magnitude better agreement with results from a quantum mechanical treatment of the polysilicon region . this built - in voltage can simply be determined by 1d simulations or an analytical expression . in reality ,",
    "treatment of discrete dopants in the polysilicon region will give rise to results that are in between the flat band and q - poly cases presented in the paper .",
    "a quantum mechanical treatment of the polysilicon gate region results in an off current ( @xmath166 v and @xmath178 v ) that is more than 35 times larger than the off current from a flat band treatment of polysilicon region and published results  @xcite based on a sophisticated semiclassical simulator .",
    "\\(b ) resonant levels in the channel the from source to drain increase the effective source injection barrier for ballistic electrons .",
    "further , even in the ballistic limit the transmission versus energy reaches integer values over an energy range that could be many times the thermal energy .",
    "knowledge of the detailed shape of transmission versus energy is important to accurately determine the ballistic current .",
    "the precise shape of these transmission steps depends on the details of the channel to source and drain overlap regions and the resulting 2d potential profile . assuming a sharp step - like increases in the total transmission is incorrect .    the slope @xmath171 , whose importance was emphasized in reference and the drive current ( at @xmath169v ) are about 300% larger than reported in reference .",
