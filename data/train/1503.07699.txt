    ", @xmath4 is the codimension-2 static minimal surface in ads@xmath5 whose boundary and area are given by @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively . in this context , it has been shown that entanglement entropy obeys a _ first law _ , an exact quantum generalization of the ordinary first law of thermodynamics .",
    "thus , in any cft with a semiclassical holographic dual , this first law has an interpretation in the dual gravitational theory as a constraint on the spacetimes dual to cft states .",
    "based on the ryu - takayanagi proposal and this first law of entanglement , it is possible to extract the dynamics of the emergent space - time at linearized level ( for certain entangling regions ) .",

    "however , the relation between the entanglement structure underlying the tensor network construction and its geometrical description has been established only on qualitative grounds .    in this work",
    ", we find that the square of the differential generation of entanglement entropy along the renormalization group flow implemented by cmera , amounts to a geometrical description of the ground states of two ( 1 + 1)-dimensional qfts given in terms of the fisher information metric . instead of focusing on a geometric description of the entangled subsystems",
    ", we will carry out our analysis by considering the entanglement between the left and right - moving modes of the qft .",
    "furthermore , it will be shown how the emergent geometrical description of the state , remains invariant despite there is an irreducible gauge freedom in the definition of the cmera network .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 , we briefly review the formalism of entanglement renormalization for continuous quantum systems ( cmera ) , especially focusing on the coherent state formulation for free gaussian theories . in any case , we refer to @xcite for more extensive treatments and presentations of the topic .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the computation of the left - right entanglement entropy and its flow along the cmera renormalization group process . at the end of the section , we provide some hints on the emergent geometrical interpretation of the cmera differential entanglement flow in terms of the relative entropy , a measure of distinguishability between quantum states . in section 4",
    ", we comment on the emergent geometry describing the cmera renormalization and its relation with the flow of left - right entanglement computed in section 3 .",
    "it is shown how this geometric description remains invariant under some class of local gauge transformations defined along the cmera renormalization flow .",

    "disentangler_. thus iteratively , mera removes the quantum correlations between small adjacent regions of space at each length scale .",
    "this rg procedure is applied arbitrarily many times until one reaches the ir - state @xmath11 has no real space entanglement , i.e , is a completely unentangled state in case of massive theories .",

    "the gauge transformed layer operator [ eq3.7ii ] |u(u|u+du)= g(u ) u(u|u+du ) g^(u + du ) , up to first order in @xmath141 reads as , [ eq3.8 ] |u(u|u+du)= .",
    "thus , under a gauge transformation @xmath139 , the entanglement generator of the cmera flow @xmath142 transforms as , [ eq3.9 ] ^(u ) = g(u ) ( u ) g^(u ) + i g(u)_u g^(u ) .",
    "here we are interested in the class of gauge transformations which leaves the fisher information metric @xmath110 in ( [ eq3.5 ] ) invariant .",
    "formally , the fisher metric is defined through , [ eq3.10 ] g_uu=_u ( u ) |_u ( u)- _ u ( u ) | ( u)(u ) |_u ( u ) , where we have used the compressed notation [ eq3.10i ] |_u ( u)_u |(u)= -i(u)|(u ) . with this",
    ", @xmath143 can be written as the variance of @xmath142 , [ eq3.11 ] g_uu=(u ) |(u)^2| ( u)- ( u ) | ( u)|(u)^2 . now , regarding eq.([eq3.9 ] ) , it is clear that @xmath102 will remain invariant under a gauge transformation @xmath139 of the cmera flow provided that @xmath144 . in this sense , let us focus on the gauge transformations @xmath145 generated by a self - adjoint scale - dependent local operator @xmath146 , with @xmath147 being a small parameter . under these assumptions , the transformation in ( [ eq3.9 ] ) can be written as , [ eq3.12 ] ^(u ) = ( u ) + _ u ( u ) , with [ eq3.12x ] _ u ( u ) = _ u ( u)-i . here , we note that the equation which defines the cmera flow for an operator such as @xmath146 , is similar to the equation of motion of an operator in the heisenberg picture with respect to the @xmath8-dependent _ hamiltonian _",
    "@xmath142 @xcite .",
    "this equation reads as , [ eq3.13 ] _ u ( u)=i . which implies that , [ eq3.14 ] _ u ( u)=0 , and thus , @xmath148 . regarding eq.([eq3.11 ] ) , this condition assures the invariance of @xmath102 for this class of gauge transformations on the cmera flow .",
    "we have explicitly shown how the information metric emerging from a static cmera state amounts to the differential generation of entanglement entropy along the renormalization group flow .",
    "we also characterized a class of gauge transformations of this flow which leaves the metric invariant .",
    "the results have been derived only for free gaussian theories so , it would be desirable to check if these results possess some useful generalizations in the case of interacting theories . in this sense ,",
    "the ground state and correlation functions in a theory of interacting ( 1 + 1 ) bosons have been computed by means of a continuous version of the matrix product state tensor network ( cmps ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in these tensor networks , the entanglement structures needed to build a state deviates from the multiscale analysis carried out by cmera .",
    "further investigations might also address non - stationary settings such as quantum quenches .",
    "entanglement renormalization deals with time dependent states @xcite but tackling space and time on quite different grounds .",
    "it is worth to investigate if the analysis of the entanglement flow in this states could provide some light in order to formulate a time - dependent cmera in a covariant way .",
    "finally , it would be also worth to clarify if it is possible to generate cmera states / cmera entanglement flows , compatible with information metrics which extremize a ( gravitational - like ) action functional .",
