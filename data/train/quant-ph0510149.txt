    "this also means that the quantum information carried by the optical fields has been transferred to and stored in the atomic ensemble .",
    "an inverse adiabatic passage , which makes @xmath265 @xmath266 @xmath267 , will result in information transfer from the atomic ensemble to the two optical modes , i.e. , @xmath268 and @xmath269 . and",

    "it is well known that photons are non - local and not easy to be stored , but atoms are local and robust .",

    "we have investigated various protocols of quantum information processing based on the photonic properties of the emission and excitation of a @xmath280-type ( or cyclic ) atomic \" ensemble , which coupled to two quantum optical fields and one classical field .",

    "it is remarked that , even without symmetry broken , a three - level system can also form a cyclic one .",
    "the electric - dipole interaction of the classic field coupled to the two higher states in our model can be replaced by the magnetic - dipole transition .",

    "the significant phenomenon  of cyclic three - level configuration only occurs in the systems with symmetry broken as given in the present work .",
    "we also need to point out that , it is the classical field to result in various new phenomena , found in this paper . without this classical field , it would be impossible to generate the entangled states of the two optical modes . as a quantum memory , the collective excitations of the @xmath2-type atomic ensemble can store the quantum information carried by two quantum optical modes through the adiabatical manipulation .",
    "the corresponding adiabatical evolution is realized by choosing certain classical rabi frequency @xmath226 .",
    "we expect that our proposal can be confirmed and implemented experimentally in the near future .    in this paper",
    ", we just consider an ideal case .",
    "actually , in a realistic system , two kinds of decoherence mechanisms may play a role .",

    "this kind of radiation properties due to atomic decay in present system will be investigated in a following paper .",
