    "[ figure : s2 ] .",
    "here , we consider two strongly coupled systems each driven with the same pulse @xmath74 . their outputs , the heisenberg free - field operators @xmath44 and @xmath75 , are then fed into the beamsplitter which mixes the two according to the unitary transformation @xmath76 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\\\ \\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a(t ) \\\\",
    "\\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ] the detection events are then correlated electronically to arrive at a temporal coincidence histogram @xmath77n_d[t_2]]$ ] . in terms of the instantaneous correlations",
    "aforementioned , we wish to calculate @xmath77n_d[t_2 ] ] = g^{(2)}_{cd}[0]$ ] . in order to perform this calculation , we first decompose the underlying correlations of @xmath78 into more manageable components based on @xmath44 and @xmath75 that will allow us to average over all quickly varying phase terms .",
    "the phase terms are difficult to observe experimentally since they depend on femtosecond phase locking and are , regardless , not required for the observation of two - photon interference .",
    "it has been shown that after performing this procedure@xcite one arrives at @xmath79\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the correlations between @xmath80 and @xmath81 have terms only coming from a single source ( the indices could be trivially switched as @xmath44 and @xmath75 are identically independent ) . experimentally due to unknown detection efficiencies , our only true intensity reference is in proportion to the source correlation @xmath82 . combining this information with the discussion on detector bandwidth above ,",
    "we are justified to compute only the integrated and normalised correlation @xmath83 = \\frac{1}{2 } g^{(2)}_a [ 0 ] + \\frac{1}{2 } \\left[1 - \\left|g^{(1)}_a [ 0]\\right|^2\\right]\\ ] ] referenced in the main text ( equation [ 1 ] ) .",
    "hence the observable hom interference for indentically independent sources simply consists of an instantaneous measurement that depends on the total first- and second - order coherence of the source . whether this interference is truly just two - photon interference",
    "therefore depends on the nature of the source output .",
    "additionally , we note that in many real systems the first - order coherence extracted here is wildly different than the first - order coherence extracted from a michelson interferometer due to the long - time averaging action of the michelson interferometer .      experimentally , producing a single source of indistinguishable photons",
    "is often quite challenging ( let alone two ) , however we would still like to characterise the source s instantaneous degree of first order coherence . by doing so , we hope to quantify how it would behave in a hom experiment .",
    "it was realised that some aspect of two - photon interference can be observed for a single source at the input to a mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometer@xcite . in order to observe this interference",
    ", the system must be doubly excited at a time interval that matches the temporal delay between the two paths of the mz interferometer ( shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ figure : s3 ] ) . additionally , this interval must be long enough that the emission resulting from the two excitations is identically independent .    for perfect single photon input",
    "the mz output correlation is in fact two - photon interference and thus equivalent to hom interference .",
    "however , in may cases the literature has incorrectly compared the two when the source has some finite probability of emitting non - single photons .",
    "thus , we now outline the derivation of the correct measured correlation , as discussed in the main text ( equation [ 2 ] ) .",
    "consider the schematic in fig .",
    "[ figure : s3 ] : a single strongly coupled system is driven with the coherent driving field @xmath84 and has field - mode operator output @xmath85 . the first beamsplitter simply splits @xmath86 in two .",
    "here we have dropped the vacuum operator in anticipation that our detectors only measure a normally ordered moment of their input fields .",
    "next , one path is delayed by the excitation interval @xmath87 .",
    "the second beamsplitter then mixes @xmath88 with the time delayed version of itself and the detection apparatus computes @xmath89n_{d'}[t_2 ] ] = g^{(2)}_{c'd'}[0]$ ] like before .",
    "the time delay is absolutely critical : the purpose is that for time delays much less than @xmath90 , @xmath88 can interfere with itself , and therefore reproduce a correlation similar to the hom cross - correlation .",
    "although computation of @xmath91 $ ] in terms of source correlations certainly appears daunting , the independence of @xmath86 for times greater than @xmath90 dramatically simplifies the calculation of @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "this expansion is further simplified by consideration of the correlations centred around time delays that are integer multiples of @xmath90 .",
    "it is fairly trivial to show that the majority of terms for delays larger than @xmath90 are zero , with only a few additional phase - dependent terms arising .",
    "we note that although one might expect the correlations to be phase locked by the mz interferometer , our integration times of many hours quickly destroy the phase interference .",
    "since these terms once again play no role in two - photon interference , we made no effort to further stabilise our setup to observe them .",
    "consider the correlations about zero delay : @xmath86 and its time delayed version are statistically independent so equation ( 7 ) holds but with the source correlations of @xmath86 instead of @xmath44 . because the source is doubly excited the ratio of the correlations in terms of @xmath44",
    "is altered , which can easily be seen by applying the above rules .",
    "now , we arrive at the measured degree of correlation @xmath92 = g^{(2)}_a [ 0 ] + \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ n_a^2 - \\left| g^{(1)}_a [ 0 ] \\right|^2 \\right]\\ ] ] choosing instead to normalise to the maximum value of this expression we arrive at the equation discussed in the main text @xmath93 = \\frac{2}{3}g^{(2)}_a [ 0 ] + \\frac{1}{3 } \\left [ 1 - \\left| g^{(1)}_a [ 0 ] \\right|^2 \\right]\\ ] ]    next , we discuss the influence of non - equal splitting ratios at the beamsplitters to arrive at the correlations comprising each of the five observed peaks . as presented in the main text , we built our mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometer from fiber - coupled beam splitters and polarisation maintaining fibers . while this realization of a mz interferometer is very stable , the commercially available fiber - coupled beam splitters have an imperfect transmittivity ( @xmath90 ) to reflectivity ( @xmath94 ) ratio that deviates from @xmath95 . therefore , we need to derive the amplitudes of the five peak pattern observed in the correlation measurements with the individual transmitivities and reflectivities of the first beamsplitter ( @xmath96 ) and second beamsplitter ( @xmath97 ) included . both of our beamsplitters have a @xmath98 ratio of @xmath99 .",
    "the transmitted component at the first beamsplitter is sent to the longer arm of the interferometer .",
    "importantly , since this delay is realised with an additional fiber there is an additional coupling loss resulting in an effective splitting ratio of the first beamsplitter of @xmath100 .",

    "these equations can now be used to fit the measured data .",
    "we determine @xmath102 from fitting a number of peaks away from zero time delay using @xmath103 = 1 $ ] and @xmath104|^2 = 0 $ ] , followed by fitting the five peaks around zero time delay .",

    "<S> first , we perform experiments without spectral filtering . the result ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure:2]b ) is a pattern of five peaks separated by @xmath8 and repeated with the repetition rate of the laser ( @xmath9 ) . due to the quantum character of the emission , the three centre peaks around zero time delay are attenuated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the asymmetry of the five peaks results from the imperfect reflectivity to transmittivity ratios of the second beamsplitter in the fiber - coupled implementation ( see supplementary information for details ) . to quantitatively analyze the data we bin the counts in a time window of @xmath10 about the peaks ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> finally , the measurements presented here have been performed at a relatively high temperature of approximately 30 k , directly contrasting with the best previously reported hom interference visibility of @xmath17 at such a temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this difference can be understood from interaction with the high - temperature phonon bath : in bulk , the interaction with phonons results in dephasing of the emission which reduces the first - order coherence . meanwhile in a strongly coupled system , the interaction with phonons leads to a population transfer from up1 to lp1 @xcite , spectrally removing the dephased emission from the detection channel and ensuring robust high - fidelity operation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have investigated indistinguishable photon generation in a dephasing regime unlike all previous experiments and found that this region is highly beneficial for photon indistinguishability .    to corroborate our finding that the combination of shs and spectral filtering results in high - fidelity generation of indistinguishable photons we performed quantum optical simulations ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
