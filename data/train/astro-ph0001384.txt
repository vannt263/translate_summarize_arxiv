    "recent observations of high - redshift ( @xmath19 ) type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) provide the backbone of the body of evidence that we live in an accelerating universe whose content is dominated by vacuum energy ( riess et al .",

    "the observational evidence for an accelerating universe is that high-@xmath20 sne ia are @xmath2130% dimmer than expected in an open universe ( i.e. , @xmath22=0.3 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "the two most likely sources to obscure distant sne ia and affect their interpretation are dust and evolution .",
    "the tell - tale signature of extinction by galactic - type dust , reddening , has not been detected in the amount required to provide @xmath24 mag for high-@xmath20 sne ia ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) . yet",
    "the cosmological implications of the observed faintness of high-@xmath20 sne ia are so exotic as to merit the consideration of dust with more unusual properties .",
    "a physical model of dust composed of larger grains ( @xmath25 0.1 @xmath26 m ) has been posited by aguirre ( 1999a , b ) to provide a non - cosmological source of extinction with less reddening .",
    "component of this so - called `` gray '' dust , if neglected , would add too much dispersion to be consistent with the observed luminosities ( riess et al .",
    "however , aguirre ( 1999a , b ) has shown that a uniformly distributed component of _ intergalactic _ gray dust with a mass density of @xmath27 could explain the faintness of high-@xmath20 sne ia without detectable reddening and without overproducing the far - infrared ( far - ir ) background .",
    "previous data do not rule out this possibility .",
    "indeed , significant _ interstellar _ extinction in the hosts of high-@xmath20 sne ia is still favored by some ( totani & kobayashi 1999 ) .",
    "rest - frame evolution is the other potential pitfall in using high-@xmath20 sne ia to measure the cosmological parameters .",
    "the lack of a complete theoretical model of sne ia including the identification of their progenitor systems makes it difficult to access the expected evolution between @xmath28 and 0.5 ( livio 1999 ; umeda et al .",
    "1999 ; hflich , wheeler , & thielemann 1998 ) . an impressive degree of similarity has been observed between the spectral and photometric properties of nearby and high-@xmath20 sne ia ( schmidt et al .",

    "for that reason it has been necessary to compare a wide range of observable characteristics of nearby and high-@xmath20 sne ia to search for a complement to a luminosity evolution .    near - ir",
    "observations of high-@xmath20 sne ia can provide constraints on both sources of cosmological contamination . a physical model of gray intergalactic dust , such as that proposed by aguirre ( 1999a , b )",
    ", still induces some reddening of sn light which can be detected in the wavelength range between optical and near - ir light .",
    "in addition , near - ir observations provide a view of the behavior of high - redshift sne ia in a window previously unexplored .",
    "specifically , normal , nearby sne ia exhibit a second infrared maximum about a month after the initial peak .",
    "we can increase our confidence that high-@xmath20 sne ia have not evolved by observing this second maximum ; its absence would indicate a change in the physics sne ia across redshift with potentially important cosmological consequences .",

    "our high-@xmath20 supernova search team ( hzt ) has an ongoing program to discover and monitor high - redshift sne ia ( schmidt et al .",
    "sn 1999q was discovered on jan 18 , 1999 using the ctio 4-m blanco telescope with the bernstein - tyson camera ( http://www.astro.lsa.umich.edu/btc/btc.html ) as part of a 3-night program to search for high-@xmath20 sne ia using well - established methods .",
    "high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of sn 1999q obtained with the keck - ii telescope indicated that this was a typical sn ia at @xmath20=0.46 shortly before @xmath6-band maximum ( garnavich et al . 1999 ; filippenko et al . 2000 ) .",
    "rest - frame @xmath6 and @xmath30-band photometry using custom filters was obtained for sn 1999q from observatories around the world .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) monitored the @xmath6 and @xmath30 light curves of sn 1999q from @xmath21 10 to 35 days after @xmath6 maximum ( rest - frame ) using the wfpc2 and the f675w and f814w filters in the course of 6 epochs .",
    "combined , these data provide excellent coverage of the rest - frame @xmath6 and @xmath30 light curves from a few days before to 60 days after @xmath6 maximum ( in the rest frame ; clocchiatti et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "in addition , the sn was observed in the near - ir ( @xmath29-band ) for 5 epochs between 5 and 45 days after @xmath6 maximum ( in the rest frame ) .",
    "the first observation employed the european southern observatory s 3.5-m new technology telescope equipped with the son of isaac ( sofi ) infrared camera spectrograph ( http://www.ls.eso.org ) ; subsequent observations used the keck ii telescope equipped with the near - infrared camera ( nirc ; matthews & soifer 1994 ) . due to the high sky brightness in the ir , many dithered , short images were obtained and combined to avoid saturating the detector .",
    "care was taken to maintain a detected sky flux level of @xmath2110,000 counts , a regime where both sofi and nirc exhibit less than 0.5% non - linearity ( http://www.ls.eso.org ; http://www.keck.hawaii.edu ) .    using the procedure described by garnavich et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we subtracted an empirical point - spread function ( psf ) scaled to the brightness of the sn from each _ hst _ observation . a coadded image of total length 7200 seconds in both f675w and f814w revealed no trace of host galaxy light to more than 5 mag below the peak brightness of the supernova ( i.e. , @xmath31 27 ) .",
    "the host of sn 1999q is likely to be intrinsically faint or of very low surface brightness similar to the host of sn 1997ck ( garnavich et al .",
    "1998 ) . due to the negligible contribution of host galaxy light to the images",
    ", we have made no correction for contamination to the measured supernova light .",
    "assuming that the restframe @xmath32 color of the host galaxy is no redder than that of early - k - type dwarfs ( @xmath32=1.0 for k0 ) , this same practice is well justified for our measurements of sn light in the @xmath29 band .",
    "we conservatively adopt a systematic uncertainty of 0.03 mag in the sn photometry ( and 0.02 mag uncertainty in the colors ) to account for any remaining bias . the procedure described by schmidt et al .",

    "( 1998 ) was followed to calibrate the measured magnitudes of sn 1999q on the johnson @xmath6 and @xmath30 passband system .",
    "similar steps were performed to calibrate the observed @xmath29-band magnitudes of sn 1999q onto the rest - frame cousins @xmath1-band system , though a few exceptions are noted here .",
    "on three photometric nights we observed the secondary near - ir standards of persson et al .",
    "because these secondary standards are solar analogues ( 0.4 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath33 0.8 ) , one can transform these stars from the `` persson system '' to that of nirc or sofi by calculating the photometric difference of spectrophotometry of the sun between these systems .",
    "we found these differences to be quite small ( @xmath330.02 mag ) and this correction negligible . in practice the true transmission curve in @xmath29",
    "is dictated by the natural opacity of atmospheric h@xmath35o and nightly variations are generally larger than differences between different facility @xmath29-passbands .",
    "for this reason we observed secondary standards in close temporal proximity to the sn field .    due to the inherent non - linearity of airmass extinction corrections in @xmath29 , the field of sn 1999q",
    "was observed at airmasses within 0.05 of the persson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) standards to avoid the need for airmass corrections . assuming typical @xmath29-band extinction of 0.1 mag per airmass ( krisciunas et al .",

    "cross - band @xmath36-corrections ( kim , goobar , & perlmutter 1996 ) were calculated using spectrophotometry of sn 1994d ( which extend redward of 9100  ; richmond et al .",
    "1995 ) to transform the @xmath29-band magnitudes of sn 1999q to the cousins @xmath1-band . at the redshift of sn 1999q ( @xmath2 ) , observed @xmath29-band light is an excellent match to rest - frame cousins @xmath1 , and the @xmath36-correction was determined to be @xmath180.93 @xmath37 mag with no apparent dependence on supernova phase or color .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath1 photometry of sn 1999q is given in table 1 .",
    "of fundamental importance is our ability to correctly transform the observed @xmath29-band photometry to restframe @xmath1-band .",
    "schmidt et al . ( 1998 ) discusses the derivations of optical zeropoints from numerous spectrophotometric stars which also have ubvri photometry .",
    "applying the same spectrophotometry to cross - band @xmath36-corrections removes the dependence of the transformed photometry on the observed band s zeropoint .",
    "unfortunately , this type of data is not available for the j - band .",
    "we have therefore calibrated our @xmath29-band data using persson et al .",
    "standards , who are fundamentally tied to the elias ( 1982 ) standards and we adopt an appropriate @xmath29-band zeropoint uncertainty of @xmath38=0.05 mag .",
    "a unique photometric signature of typical sne ia is a resurrection of the luminosity at infrared wavelengths about a month after the initial maximum .",
    "this feature is present ( with the most exquisite photometry ) in the @xmath30 band , grows into a `` shoulder '' in @xmath39 , and increases to a second local maximum in @xmath1 ( ford et al .",
    "1993 ; suntzeff 1996 ; hamuy et al . 1996a ; riess et al .",
    "this second maximum is also readily apparent at near - ir wavelengths ( @xmath40 and @xmath36 ; elias et al .",
    "1981 ; jha et al .",
    "no other type of sn exhibits this feature .",
    "the secondary maximum is thought to result from the escape of radiation from the core of the supernova at long wavelengths .",
    "resonant scattering from lines is the dominant source of opacity . at short wavelengths ( i.e. , @xmath33 5000  ) line blanketing traps radiation ; the resonance lines at longer wavelengths are fewer and further between providing escape routes for the trapped radiation ( spyromilio , pinto , & eastman 1994 ) .",
    "wheeler et al.(1998 ) argue that this effect in itself would not explain the nonmonotic behaviour of the j - band light curve .",
    "no model as yet fully explains the shape and timing of the infrared light curves of sne .    the location and strength of the second @xmath1-band maximum is a diagnostic of the intrinsic luminosity of sne ia ( riess , press , & kirshner 1996 ; hamuy et al .",
    "sne ia with typical peak luminosity ( i.e. , @xmath41 mag ) crest again in @xmath1 about 30 days after @xmath6 maximum .",
    "dimmer sne ia reach their second peak earlier .",
    "for example , sn 1992bo was @xmath210.5 mag fainter than a typical sn ia and reached its second peak in @xmath1 at @xmath2120 days after @xmath6 maximum ( maza et al .",
    "for very subluminous sne ia this second maximum is completely absent , merging into the phase of the initial decline ( e.g. , sn 1991bg ; filippenko et al .",
    "the physics detailing the formation of this feature also indicates that its magnitude and timing are sensitive to explosion parameters ( e.g. , ejecta composition ) which determine the peak luminosity ( spyromilio , pinto , & eastman 1994 ) .    in figure 1 the relative rest - frame @xmath1-band magnitudes of sn 1999q ( @xmath2 )",
    "are compared to a luminosity sequence of nearby sne ia .",
    "the phase of the observations of sn 1999q was determined by multicolor light - curve shape ( mlcs ; riess et al .",

    "1996 ; goldhaber et al . 1997 ; riess et al .",
    "although the precision and sampling of the rest - frame @xmath1-band data are not high , they are sufficient to indicate that this high-@xmath20 sn ia retains significant luminosity at @xmath2130 days after @xmath6 maximum , consistent with the phase of the second @xmath1-band peak of typical sne ia and inconsistent with either very subluminous or moderately subluminous sne ia . using the @xmath6 and @xmath30 light - curve shapes of sn 1999q as a luminosity indicator",
    ", we find its distance modulus to be @xmath44=42.67@xmath45 mag , consistent with previous sne ia favoring a cosmological constant ( riess et al .",
    "if instead we consider the shape of the @xmath1-band light curve as an independent luminosity indicator , we find that this high-@xmath20 sn ia ( and presumably other high-@xmath20 sne ia ) is not consistent with being subluminous by 0.5 - 0.6 mag as needed to indicate a universe closed by ordinary matter .",
    "more precise data will be needed to differentiate between an open and @xmath46-dominated universe solely on the basis of @xmath1-band light curve shapes .      to measure the @xmath47 colors of sn 1999q we used the mlcs fits to the @xmath6 light curve to determine the expected @xmath6 magnitudes at the time of the ir observations .",
    "due to the exquisite _ hst _ photometry in rest - frame @xmath6 , this process adds little uncertainty to the @xmath47 magnitudes .    the milky way ( mw ) dust maps from schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) predict a reddening of @xmath48=0.021 mag in the direction of sn 1999q .",
    "we subtracted the expected galactic reddening of the rest - frame @xmath47 light ( observed as @xmath49 ) of sn 1999q , 0.037 mag , from the measured colors .",
    "any remaining reddening results from extragalactic sources .    in figure 2 the measured @xmath47 magnitudes of sn 1999q are compared to a custom @xmath47 curve predicted from the mlcs fits to the @xmath6 and @xmath30 light - curve shapes ( riess et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "the smaller uncertainties shown here result from photon statistics and were determined empirically ( schmidt et al . 1998 ) .",
    "a significant , additional source of uncertainty is the intrinsic dispersion of sne ia @xmath47 colors around their custom mlcs model .",
    "this intrinsic dispersion is determined empirically by measuring the variance of 30 nearby sne ia around their mlcs fits ( riess et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) and varies from 0.1 to 0.3 mag depending on the sn ia age .",
    "although the observed residuals from the model prediction are correlated for time separations of less than 3 days , correlated errors are insignificant for the larger differences in time between the observations of sn 1999q .",
    "the larger uncertainties shown in figure 2 for the @xmath47 photometry of sn 1999q include the intrinsic uncertainties .",
    "the measured @xmath3 for sn 1999q is @xmath180.09@xmath50 mag .",
    "the error includes the systematic uncertainties of the @xmath36-corrections and the zeropoint of the @xmath29-band system , although the dominant sources of error are the photometry noise and the intrinsic dispersion in sn ia @xmath47 colors .",
    "this value is consistent with no reddening of this high-@xmath20 sn ia .",
    "if galactic - type dust rather than a cosmological constant were the sole reason that @xmath51 sne ia are 30% fainter than expected for an open universe ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) , then the @xmath3 of sn 1999q should be 0.25 mag ( savage & mathis 1979 ) .",
    "this alternative to an accelerating universe ( see totani & kobayashi 1999 ) is inconsistent with the data at the 99.9% confidence level ( 3.4@xmath4 ) .",
    "the reddening required for the sne ia data to be consistent with a universe closed by matter is ruled out at the @xmath2599.99% ( 5.1@xmath4 ) confidence level . despite the low precision of this data set , the wavelength range of the @xmath47 colors results in the ability to rule out extinction by galactic - type dust from sn 1999q alone with similar confidence as from the entire set of @xmath34 color data of riess et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and perlmutter et al . ( 1999 ) .",
    "the reduced amount of reddening by `` gray '' dust grains ( i.e. , @xmath25 0.1 @xmath26 m ) as proposed by aguirre ( 1999a , b ) is more difficult to detect .",
    "the amount of gray dust needed to supplant the cosmological constant as the cause of the dimming of high-@xmath20 sne ia would result in an @xmath3=0.17 or 0.14 mag for a composition of graphite or graphite / silicate , respectively ( aguirre 1999a , b ) .",
    "these possibilities are moderately inconsistent with the data at the 99.0% ( 2.6@xmath4 ) and 97.7% ( 2.3@xmath4 ) confidence levels , respectively .",
    "the reddening provided by enough of such dust to change the cosmological forecast to favor a universe closed by matter is ruled out at the 99.97%(3.7@xmath4 ) and 99.90%(3.3@xmath4 ) confidence levels , respectively .",
    "the weakest constraint comes from assuming the smallest amount of the grayest type of dust which is consistent at the 68% ( 1@xmath4 ) confidence level with an open universe ( i.e. , @xmath53=0.2 mag ) .",
    "this dust is inconsistent with the data at the 94% ( 1.9 @xmath4 ) confidence level ( although the true inconsistency of this scenario is derived from the product of the two individual likelihoods , i.e. , 98% or 2.3@xmath4 ) .",
    "although these results disfavor the existence of the proposed levels of gray dust , more data are needed to strengthen this important test .    because it is difficult to assess all sources of uncertainty in our model for the sn ia @xmath47 color evolution , we also performed a monte carlo simulation of the measurement of @xmath3 for sn 1999q . using all nearby sne",
    "ia which are not spectroscopically peculiar ( see branch , fisher , & nugent 1993 ) nor photometrically extreme ( @xmath54 ; phillips 1993 ) and whose @xmath47 colors were well observed , we generated a standard , unreddened @xmath47 template curve using individual reddening estimates from phillips et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for nearby sne ia .",
    "we then randomly selected five observations from a random member of the sample and perturbed the observations to match the photometric noise in the sn 1999q observations . from 10,000 such synthetic measurements we generated a distribution of measured @xmath3",

    "sn 1999q has an @xmath3 = @xmath180.12 mag .",

    "the results are consistent with no extragalactic reddening and inconsistent with galactic and gray dust reddening at nearly identical ( though marginally higher ) confidence levels as the mlcs fits .",
    "the strength of this method is that it samples real sn ia data in the same manner as the observations of sn 1999q and therefore incorporates the intrinsic and correlated uncertainties in the @xmath47 colors of sne ia .",
    "two teams have independently concluded that the observed faintness of high-@xmath20 sne ia indicates that the expansion of the universe is accelerating and that dark energy dominates the energy density of the universe ( riess et al .",

    "however , as a well - known adage reminds us , `` extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence . ''",
    "alternative explanations such as evolution in supernova luminosities or dust are no more exotic than a cosmological constant and must be rigorously tested .",

    "measurements of @xmath34 colors indicate that this quantity of galactic - type dust is not obscuring high-@xmath20 sne ia ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) and the @xmath47 observations presented here bolster this evidence .",
    "however , observations of neither sne ia nor other astrophysical objects previously ruled out a similar opacity by intergalactic gray dust ( aguirre 1999a , b ) . the observations presented here",
    "do disfavor a gray intergalactic medium providing this opacity , but additional data are needed to strengthen these conclusions .",
    "indeed , a more precise measurement of @xmath3 or @xmath57 could constrain either the total optical depth of dust in the intergalactic medium or alternately push the minimum size of such grains into an unphysical domain ( aguirre 1999a , b ) .",
    "it may even be possible to use such measurements to constrain the contribution to the far - ir background by emission from the intergalactic medium ( aguirre 1999a , b ) .",

    "to date , our inability to formulate a complete theoretical description of sne ia makes it impossible to either predict the degree of expected luminosity evolution between @xmath28 and 0.5 or to identify an observation which would conclusively determine whether the luminosity of sne ia are evolving ( but see hoeflich , thielemann & wheeler 1998 ) .",
    "an empirical recourse is to compare all observable properties of nearby and high-@xmath20 sne ia with the assumption that if the luminosity of sne ia has evolved by @xmath2130% other altered characteristics of the explosion would be visible as well .",
    "the detection of such a change would cast doubt on the reliability of the luminosity distances from high-@xmath20 sne ia . a continued failure to measure any difference between sn ia near and",

    "the weight of the evidence suggests no significant evolution of the observed sne ia , but more observations are needed to allay remaining reasonable doubts .",
    "perhaps the best indication that sne ia provide reliable distances at high redshifts comes from sne ia in nearby early - type and late - type galaxies .",
    "these galaxies span a larger range of metallicity , stellar age , and interstellar environments than is expected to occur for galaxies back to @xmath59 . yet after correction for the light - curve - shape / luminosity relationship and extinction , no significant hubble diagram residuals are seen which correlate with host galaxy morphology .",
    "this suggests that our distance estimates are insensitive to variations in the supernova progenitor environment ( schmidt et al .",
