    "hence @xmath4 evolves deterministically except for upward jumps of fixed size @xmath6 occurring at random times .",
    "we take the systematic `` force '' @xmath10 such that it has positive derivative and satisfies @xmath11 , which ensures that @xmath12 possesses a stationary distribution .",

    "persistence exponent_. the theory of critical phenomena has brought to light the importance of exponents for the classification of physical systems .",
    "this has spurred theoretical physicists in recent years to attempt to calculate persistence exponents associated with several prominent problems of that discipline .",
    "the exponents are in each case nontrivial and unrelated to the static and dynamic critical exponents of the same problem .",
    "many authors have studied processes of zero average and symmetric under sign change of @xmath12 .",
    "the quantity of primary interest is then `` the '' persistence exponent associated with the threshold @xmath19 . for nonzero @xmath17 one",
    "also speaks of the _ level _ exponents .",
    "a review article of earlier work , mainly mathematical , is due to blake and lindsay @xcite .",
    "majumdar @xcite and godrche @xcite have provided useful reviews of recent work , mainly by physicists .",
    "almost all of this work deals with processes @xmath4 that are gaussian . among these",
    "the gaussian markovian case is easiest to treat .",

    "_ @xcite and sire _",
    "@xcite , have designed a perturbative method for processes that are gaussian and close to markovian .",
    "majumdar and bray @xcite have set up an @xmath20 expansion for smooth gaussian processes in spatial dimension @xmath21 .",
    "nontrivial persistence exponents have also been identified for such familiar functions as the solution of the diffusion equation with random initial condition @xcite .",
    "all these persistence exponents appear to be extremely difficult to calculate analytically .",
    "+ in physical systems the addition of the effects of many degrees of freedom very often leads to gaussian processes . nevertheless , certain non - gaussian processes also arise naturally . in this work",
    "we study the level exponents for the strongly non - gaussian case of eq.([defxi ] ) .",
    "one example of how closely related processes enter physics is through a question @xcite associated with the one - dimensional random walk .",
    "let @xmath22 be the number of steps needed before the walk has visited @xmath23 distinct sites .",
    "then @xmath24 is a stationary process consisting of exponential decay interrupted by upward jumps .",
    "the only difference with eq.([defxi ] ) is that it leads to a probability distribution of the jump sizes , whereas in ( [ defxi ] ) we take @xmath6 a fixed parameter .",
    "numerical evidence shows that this problem possesses well - defined persistence exponents , but , as in many other cases , no way exists to find them analytically .",
    "other instances are furnished by statistical physical models that exhibit cluster growth , such as random sequential absorption and percolation theory ; if @xmath4 is the suitably scaled size of a particular cluster , then jumps are due to coalescence with other clusters . as a specific example , let the bonds of a lattice be rendered percolating in a sequential manner @xcite and let @xmath23 be the instantaneous fraction of percolating bonds ; define then @xmath22 as the size of the cluster connected to the origin . in spatial dimension one it is easily shown @xcite that an appropriate scaling ( which is such that @xmath25 as @xmath26 ) yields again a stationary process @xmath4 with a probablity law for the jump sizes . + in order to study the persistence exponents associated with eq.([defxi ] ) we exploit the following idea . the persistence probability @xmath15 is determined by the subclass of @xmath4 that do not cross below @xmath17 for @xmath27 .",
    "when the force @xmath10 is strongly positive , then a @xmath4 in the contributing subclass is unlikely ever to rise very high above the threshold @xmath17 .",
    "we conjecture , therefore , that we will obtain a good description of this subclass by expanding @xmath10 around the threshold value @xmath14 .",
    "we convert this idea into an expansion procedure . roughly speaking ,",
    "the zeroth and the first order of the expansion are determined by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , _",
    "i.e. , _ by the slope and the curvature/(slope)@xmath30 ratio of the deterministic evolution curve .",
    "the precise mathematics is slightly more subtle and shows that instead two parameters appear , called @xmath31 and @xmath1 , whose definition is more complicated .",
    "our theory then yields the level exponents @xmath0 in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath1 in the small @xmath1 limit .",
    "we shall refer to @xmath1 as the _ curvature parameter . _",
    "+ in section [ secgeneralities ] we write @xmath15 as a path integral on all contributing @xmath4 .",
    "the expression resembles the partition function of a system of interacting particles in a one - dimensional volume @xmath16 , with the jump times @xmath32 in the role of the particle positions .",
    "we rearrange the path integral in such a way that a `` noninteracting '' contribution appears , characterized by a parameter @xmath31 , and a remainder due to an `` interaction potential '' @xmath33 which is a functional of the jump times .",
    "our use of the term `` noninteracting '' does not mean that the @xmath34 problem is trivial ",
    "it is not  , but merely that it is purely combinatorial .",
    "we are led to define the parameter @xmath31 of the noninteracting theory by @xmath35 & = & \\frac{\\rho a}{a(x)}\\,\\big(1\\,-\\,\\frac{aa'(x)}{2a(x)}+\\ldots\\big ) \\label{defra}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation shows that @xmath31 involves not only @xmath28 but also the full series of its derivatives .    in section [ seclinear ]",
    "we consider the zeroth order , @xmath34 .",
    "it amounts to replacing @xmath10 in eq.([defxi ] ) by the constant @xmath36 , so that as a consequence @xmath4 is piecewise linear with slope @xmath37 .",
    "all samples of this zeroth order process are therefore `` random sawtooth '' functions . in this order we shall write the level exponent as @xmath38 .",
    "we find @xmath39 for @xmath40 the persistence exponent goes to zero ; the interpretation of this unphysical effect is that for @xmath41 the linearization creates a finite probability for @xmath4 to escape to @xmath42 .",
    "+ in section [ secnonlinear ] we consider the interacting theory , @xmath43 .",
    "the potential @xmath33 is determined by @xmath44 in a way described in that section .",
    "we are unable to deal with the general case .",
    "instead , we expand @xmath33 in a series of which we retain only the first term , whose coefficient @xmath1 plays the role of an interaction constant .",
    "the expression for @xmath1 is @xmath45 & = & \\frac{aa'(x)}{a(x)}\\ , \\big(1\\,+\\,\\frac{aa''(x)}{a(x)}\\,+\\ldots\\big ) \\label{defga}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we show that there are at least two limits in which the higher order terms in the series for @xmath33 are negligible , and in which the remaining problem , with only two parameters @xmath31 and @xmath1 , can be solved .",
    "the subsections [ secrecursionkom ] and [ secanalysiskom ] are common to both limits .",
    "the laplace transform @xmath46 of the path integral for @xmath15 appears to satisfy a recursion relation whose solution is expressed in eq.([solkom ] ) as the ratio of two infinite series .",
    "explicit evaluation of these series turns out to be a rather formidable task .",
    "the soluble limits are the following .    _ limit ( i ) . _",
    "the limit @xmath47 at @xmath31 fixed .",
    "eqs.([defra ] ) and ( [ defga ] ) show that this corresponds to @xmath48 at fixed @xmath28 . in subsection [ secdelto0 ]",
    "we calculate the exponent @xmath49 in a small @xmath50 expansion , with the result that a nonanalytic correction term to eq.([resthetalin ] ) appears , @xmath51    _ limit ( ii ) . _",
    "the limit @xmath52 with fixed ratio @xmath53 .",
    "eqs.([defra ] ) and ( [ defga ] ) show that this corresponds to @xmath54 at fixed @xmath55 . in this limit the expansions in eqs.([defra ] ) and ( [ defga ] ) may be replaced by their first term , which we shall denote by an index 0 , @xmath56 this limit , considered in subsection [ secaldelto0 ] , requires separate analysis ; nevertheless , the result for @xmath57 is what one also obtains by naively substituting @xmath58 and @xmath59 in eq.([restaudelta ] ) .",
    "the example of greatest interest is the linear equation that prevails for the choice @xmath13 . when the threshold @xmath17 becomes large we have @xmath60 and @xmath61 . upon expressing for this case @xmath0 as a function of @xmath17",
    "we arrive at the explicit asymptotic expansion @xmath62 in section [ secapplications ] we compare analytical results for both limit cases to monte carlo simulations of eq.([defxi ] ) .",
    "excellent agreement is found . in particular , there is strong numerical indication that the higher order terms in the asymptotic expansion ( [ resthetaexp ] ) go to zero as @xmath63 .",
    "+ the name _ langevin equation _ is traditionally reserved for equations of type ( [ defxi ] ) where the random term represents gaussian white noise . in section [ seccomparison ]",
    "we observe that the white noise of eq.([defxi ] ) becomes gaussian in the limit @xmath64 and @xmath65 at fixed @xmath66 , and that , correspondingly ( and after appropriate rescaling of variables ) eq.([defxi ] ) becomes a langevin equation .",
    "hence our work enables us to pass continuously from strongly non - gaussian to gaussian noise . in subsection [ secthetag ]",
    "we place ourselves directly in the gaussian limit and determine , _ via _ the associated fokker ",
    "planck equation , the gaussian persistence exponent @xmath67 for asymptotically high threshold ; our method is close to the one of krapivsky and redner @xcite . in subsection [ secglimit ]",
    "we then investigate how the gaussian limit emerges from the more general approach of sections [ secgeneralities][secapplications ] .",
    "section [ secconclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the solution of eq.([defxi ] ) is piecewise continuous . in the time interval between two jumps @xmath4 evolves deterministically according to @xmath68 where @xmath69 determines a shift along the time axis and the function @xmath70 , if we choose it such that @xmath71 , is obtained from @xmath10 by @xmath72 hence @xmath69 acquires the meaning of the ultimate instant of time at which the @xmath73th jump should take place if @xmath4 is to stay above the threshold .",
    "the fact that there is a jump of size @xmath6 on the border between two successive time intervals leads to the identity @xmath74    we shall be more specific now and consider the solution @xmath4 of eq.([defxi ] ) with initial value @xmath75 .",
    "it is uniquely specified by the set of jump times @xmath76 eq.([f4 ] ) , which is here valid for @xmath77 allows one to express @xmath78 in terms of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and , upon iterating , as a function of @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "finally , @xmath82 may be eliminated in favor of the initial value @xmath83 by means of @xmath84 .",
    "hence we have obtained the formal answer to the question of how to find @xmath69 as a function of the random jump times and the initial condition",
    ". below it will be convenient to use @xmath85 and @xmath86 ; with that convention eq.([f4 ] ) holds also for @xmath87 _ if _ we take the special initial condition @xmath88 .",
    "+      the persistence probability @xmath15 can be expressed as a path integral on all random functions @xmath4 , hence as an integral on all jump times @xmath89 it is now useful to note that the @xmath69 are ordered according to @xmath90",
    "so that there exists an @xmath91 for which @xmath92 the interpretation is that after the @xmath93th jump the function @xmath4 is sure to stay above the threshold @xmath17 , even if no further jumps occur , in the interval @xmath94 $ ] .",
    "summing on all possibilities implied by eq.([defl ] ) we can write @xmath15 as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the heaviside step function and where we used that @xmath97 is the joint probability density for the first @xmath93 jumps to occur at @xmath98 . the @xmath99 term in eq.([suml ] ) has no integrals and is equal to @xmath100 . in the remainder",
    "we will use the shorthand notation @xmath101 the expression ( [ suml ] ) for @xmath15 bears great similarity to the grand - canonical partition function of an assembly of interacting particles in a one - dimensional volume @xmath16 , with the jump times @xmath32 playing the role of the particle positions and with the interaction implicit in the upper integration limits @xmath102    in terms of laplace transforms eq.([suml ] ) is equivalent to @xmath103 one more rewriting is useful . for @xmath104",
    "one easily finds the relation @xmath105 when eq.([aux1 ] ) is substituted in eq.([defqhat ] ) cancellations occur . after we replace @xmath106 with the dimensionless variable @xmath107 we can express the problem by the three equations @xmath108 of which the last one implies , in particular , that @xmath109 .",

    "@xmath106 the persistence exponent @xmath0 will be given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the real part of the rightmost nonanalyticity of @xmath111 in the complex @xmath106 plane , and @xmath114 is the corresponding value of @xmath115 .",
    "any further nonanalyticities at @xmath116 will similarly give rise to correction terms in the decay of @xmath15 characterized by @xmath117      at this stage the problem is to calculate @xmath119 of eq.([finalgen ] ) , defined as an integral via eq.([defintl ] ) , in which the upper integration limits @xmath69 are defined recursively via eq.([f4 ] ) .",
    "this problem depends parametrically on the function @xmath10 or , equivalently , on @xmath70 , and on the threshold @xmath17 .",
    "we can still gain by transforming to another set of parameters",
    ". that will be the purpose of this subsection .",
    "each jump provides the process with an additional lapse of time before hitting the threshold .",
    "the extra time furnished by the @xmath73th jump is @xmath120 .",
    "the negative slope of @xmath121 restricts @xmath120 to a maximum value that we shall call @xmath122 and which occurs for @xmath123 . using this in eq.([f4 ] )",

    ". the @xmath73th jump will generally take place _ before _ rather than _ at _ the ultimate instant @xmath69 .",
    "due to the upward curvature of @xmath121 the actual extra time gained is therefore generally less than @xmath122 .",
    "we will express this curvature effect explicitly in terms of a variable @xmath125 by setting , for @xmath77",
    "@xmath126 whence necessarily @xmath127 .",
    "we now use this equation in ( [ f4 ] ) to eliminate @xmath78 and we then subtract eq.([deftau ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath128 from which @xmath125 can be solved in terms of @xmath129 .",
