    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    in a recent letter @xcite de  albuquerque and leite ( al ) presented results to second order in @xmath0 for the critical exponents @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 of @xmath4-dimensional systems with @xmath5-axial lifshitz points </S>",
    "<S> . for the special case @xmath6 of a uniaxial lifshitz point , these results were previously given in a ( so far apparently unpublished ) preprint @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 terms al found are at variance with ours @xcite .    as an explanation for these discrepancies </S>",
    "<S> al suggest the following . both we as well as al employed a field - theoretic renormalization group approach based on dimensional regularization . to compute the residua of the ultraviolet poles at @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> , we found it convenient to perform ( part of ) the calculation in position space . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , al worked entirely in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> they speculate @xcite `` that calculations performed in momentum space and coordinate space are inequivalent , as far as the lifshitz critical behaviour is concerned '' .    </S>",
    "<S> this speculation is untenable and a serious misconception , a fact which should be obvious not only to readers with a background in field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the reason simply is : at each step of the calculation one can transform from momentum space to position space and vice versa .    to become more specific , </S>",
    "<S> consider an @xmath9-point vertex function @xmath10 of a dimensionally regularized , translationally invariant , renormalizable euclidean field theory , such as the @xmath11 theory for an @xmath5-axial lifshitz point considered both by us @xcite and al . in momentum space </S>",
    "<S> the vertex functions have the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 are conventional _ functions _ of @xmath14 independent momenta , e.g. , @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath13 also depend on @xmath16 ( i.e. , on @xmath4 ) : they are _ meromorphic _ in @xmath16 , having ultraviolet ( uv ) poles at @xmath17 . since the issue is the @xmath16 expansion , these are the only poles we have to consider ; possible other uv poles at special values @xmath18 need not concern us here . likewise , we do not have to worry about possible infrared poles one encounters in perturbation expansions about the lifshitz point for a fixed space dimension @xmath4 , nor embark on a discussion of related subtle questions like the appearance of perturbatively non - accessible mass - shifts meromorphic in @xmath16 , and on how these problems are avoided in massive , fixed-@xmath4 renormalization schemes .    </S>",
    "<S> the fourier back - transforms of the _ functions _ @xmath13 define _ generalized functions ( distributions ) _ , which depend on the @xmath14 difference variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the same applies to each individual feynman integral contributing to @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> field - theoretical renormalization group approaches such as the ones on which al s work and ours are based hinge on the possibility of introducing a well - defined _ renormalized _ theory by absorbing the uv singularities of the theory s primitively divergent vertex functions in a consistent manner through counter - terms that are _ local in position space_. in order that the renormalization procedure can be interpreted as a re - parametrization , these counter - terms must have the form of the ( local ) interactions appearing in the original hamiltonian , except for a finite number of admissible additive ones . </S>",
    "<S> well - known mathematical renormalization theorems @xcite ensure that this is the case , order by order in perturbation theory .    </S>",
    "<S> central to the proofs of such renormalization theorems is the observation that the primitive uv singularities have a _ local _ structure in _ </S>",
    "<S> position space_. it is precisely this property that is crucial for the renormalizability of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> it ensures that the counter - terms , computed to a given order of perturbation theory , provide the subtractions for all divergent subintegrations of the feynman graphs of the next higher order that are required to cancel _ all those uv singularities that do not have the form of local counter - terms . </S>",
    "<S> _ such nonlocal uv singularities occur indeed : for instance , the graph has momentum - dependent pole terms @xmath22 ( involving logarithms of momenta ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are due to the divergent subintegral ; they do _ not _ have the form of local counter - terms but cancel upon making the appropriate subtraction for this subgraph . </S>",
    "<S> ( this subtraction is produced by part of the one - loop counter - term @xmath23 ; see , e.g. , sec .  </S>",
    "<S> 3.b of ref .  @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> zimmermann s forest formula @xcite clarifies precisely which subtractions have to be made for each individual feynman graph . </S>",
    "<S> the locality of the counter - terms manifests itself in the fact that in the final subtractions which must be made for superficially divergent graphs the graph is _ shrunk to a point_.    what we have just explained has been known for decades and can be found in standard textbooks on field theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is true that many authors for computational reasons prefer the momentum representation when explaining the renormalization procedure . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the significance of the uv singularities local structure in position space may escape the reader s attention if not properly emphasized . </S>",
    "<S> however , a very clear exposition of the importance of this locality is given already in one of the earliest , classic textbooks on renormalization @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization procedure can be performed equally well in momentum or position space . </S>",
    "<S> utilizing dimensional regularization in conjunction with minimal subtraction of poles is advantageous in that one does not have to worry about how the regularization scheme and the conditions for fixing the counter - terms translate upon fourier transformation : the scheme can be applied equally well in the momentum or position representation . </S>",
    "<S> the upshot of these considerations is that _ there is no way that al s and our calculation can be both correct_.    the source of the discrepancies between al s work and ours can be traced back to the different results they find for the required two - loop integrals . </S>",
    "<S> for example , our result for the integral @xmath24 defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) of al s paper @xcite reads @xmath25}+o(\\epsilon^0)\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the scaling function associated with the free critical propagator in position space ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 13 ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , at the upper critical dimension @xmath28 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 is a unit @xmath30 vector , while @xmath31 is an arbitrarily directed @xmath5-vector . </S>",
    "<S> the integral @xmath32 is similar to @xmath33 , except that its integrand has an additional factor @xmath34 .    from al s eqs .  ( 11 ) and ( 18 ) , we can infer their result for @xmath35 ; it reads @xmath36 to see that this can not be correct , one must merely consider the isotropic case @xmath37 : for this , al s result ( [ al1 ] ) predicts a pole @xmath38 , even though the pole part @xmath39 _ must vanish _ because @xmath40 has @xmath41 components . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , our result ( [ eq : i3poles])([eq : phi ] ) does not violate this condition since @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> ( see sec .  </S>",
    "<S> 4.5 and 4.4 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where we verified that our @xmath16-expansion results for general values of @xmath5 reduce to known ones in both isotropic case @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . )    </S>",
    "<S> al realized the incorrectness of their findings for @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> yet they seem to believe that the ` approximations ' they made in their computation of @xmath46 loop integrals do not lead to erroneous results . </S>",
    "<S> details of their approximations are described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the crux of their method is ` to impose the constraint ' @xmath47 on the momenta of the internal integral @xmath48}\\ ] ] of @xmath49 this amounts to modifying the momentum term @xmath50 of the last propagator in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ i2 ] ) to @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the error this introduces is given by the analogue of the integral ( [ i3 ] ) one obtains through replacement of @xmath52 by the corresponding difference @xmath53 , namely @xmath54}\\nonumber\\\\&&\\qquad\\times \\frac{k_1 ^ 4 + 4\\,(k_1 ^ 2+k_2 ^ 2)\\,{\\boldsymbol{k}}_1\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{k}}_2 + 6\\,k_1 ^ 2\\,k_2 ^ 2}{[({\\boldsymbol{p}}_1 + { \\boldsymbol{p}}_2+{\\boldsymbol{p}})^2+k_2 ^ 4]}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now the pole term @xmath55 of @xmath56 we are concerned with corresponds to a logarithmic uv divergence @xmath57 at the upper critical dimension ( @xmath58 cut - off ) . in order for al s approximation to be correct </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath59 must have no contributions that vary as @xmath60 or @xmath61 as @xmath62 . as can be seen for instance by power counting , </S>",
    "<S> this condition is _ not satisfied_. ( readers preferring more mathematical scrutiny might want to compute @xmath63 and study its behaviour for large @xmath64 and @xmath65 . ) </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , al s approximation is unjustified whenever @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the same kind of approximations are employed by al for other @xmath67 loop integrals .    in closing , let us outline how the pole term @xmath68 of @xmath56 given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ i3 ] ) can be recovered via a momentum - space calculation . using a schwinger representation for each one of the three propagators in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ i2 ] ) and ( [ i3 ] ) , and performing the gaussian integrations over @xmath69 and @xmath70 , we obtain @xmath71 next , we make the variable transformations @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and take the derivative @xmath75 inside the integrals . </S>",
    "<S> the integration over @xmath76 can now be performed ; it produces the factor @xmath77 . upon transforming to the variables @xmath78 and @xmath79 , one finds that @xmath80 this is in conformity with eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : i3poles])([eq : phi ] ) . to see this , note that the integral </S>",
    "<S> @xmath81 is proportional to @xmath82 . in momentum space </S>",
    "<S> , this is a convolution of the form @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform @xmath84 can be read off from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 14 ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; it involves a modified bessel function @xmath85 , for which we use the representation @xmath86 with integration variables @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> employing the transformations @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , we perform the integration over @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is the residuum of the pole ( [ eq : res ] ) .    to summarize : al s results are incorrect because of their unacceptable approximations made in computing feynman diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> their speculation that the field - theoretic rg approach might yield different results depending on whether it is performed in position or momentum space does not hold .    </S>",
