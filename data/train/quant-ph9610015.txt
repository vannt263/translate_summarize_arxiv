    "since shor s discovery @xcite of an algorithm that allows the factorization of a large number by a quantum computer in polynomial time instead of an exponential time as in classical computing , interest in the practical realization of a quantum computer has been much enhanced @xcite .",
    "recent advances in the preparation and manipulation of single ions as well as the engineering of pre - selected cavity light fields have made quantum optics that field of physics which promises the first experimental realization of a quantum computer .",
    "several proposals ( reviewed in @xcite ) for possible experimental implementations have been made relying on nuclear spins , quantum dots @xcite , cavity qed @xcite and on ions in linear traps @xcite .",
    "the realization of a quantum computer in a linear trap in particular was regarded as very promising as it was thought that decoherence could be suppressed sufficiently to preserve the superpositions necessary for quantum computation .",
    "indeed , a single quantum gate in such an ion trap was recently realized by monroe et al @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the error rate in this experiment was too high to allow the realization of extended quantum networks .",
    "this experiment was not solely limited by fundamental processes but rather by technical difficulties and one aim of future experiments is to reduce these technical problems to come closer to the fundamental limits , such that at least small networks could be realized .",
    "however , there remains the question whether overcoming technical problems will be sufficient to realize practically useful computations such as factorization of big numbers on a quantum computer in a linear ion trap .",
    "in fact one has to investigate more thoroughly those limitations that are due to processes of more fundamental nature than for example laser linewidths , pulse lengths etc .",
    "general considerations revealed that decoherence will lead to an exponential decrease in the probability to obtain the correct result of a calculation @xcite .",
    "however , these considerations did not state how fast this exponential decay would be and therefore left open the question to whether factorization will be possible or not .",
    "an analysis of this problem was first carried out in refs . @xcite where the impact of spontaneous emission on the problem of factorization of a large number by a quantum computer was considered .",
    "it was shown that for realistic laser powers , factorization is limited to small numbers ( at least if no sophisticated error correction methods are implemented ) .",
    "subsequent investigations have appeared to be less pessimistic , but we note that these did not consider spontaneous emission but instead concentrated on other effects such as phonon decoherence @xcite or the influence of the ion separation @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite limits were obtained that still depended on the power of the applied lasers and which therefore leave open the possibility of improving the maximal bitsize @xmath0 of the largest factorizable number by using high power lasers .",
    "extremely high intensities , however , will lead to ionization or , more importantly , to a breakdown of the two - level - approximation as was mentioned briefly in @xcite . in section",
    "ii we will use the breakdown of the two - level - approximation to derive new estimates for the bitsize @xmath0 of the factorizable number .",
    "the new feature in these estimates is their _ independence _ on the power of the applied laser .",
    "we derive intensity independent limits of @xmath0 not only for qubits stored in a metastable optical transition ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) but also for qubits stored in the zeeman sublevels of an ion which are then manipulated using detuned raman transitions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . on the basis of experimental parameters for several ions we give estimates for @xmath1 and",
    "we show that spontaneous emission already imposes strong limitations to @xmath0 .",
    "we then conclude that factorization without the use of efficient error correction methods is limited to almost trivial numbers if spontaneous emission is present , which in reality is inevitable . in section iii",
    "we therefore proceed to investigate the degree to which such quantum error correction methods are able to improve on these results .",
    "it is generally believed that quantum error correction is able to increase the number of possible operations substantially , e.g. a single error correcting code should allow to perform a number of operations which is approximately the square of the number of allowed operations without error correction .",
    "we analyze critically this idea in real atomic systems , especially taking into account the fact that due to the breakdown of the two - level approximation spontaneous transitions may leak population out of those levels that represent the qubit in the ion .",
    "it will be difficult , if not impossible , to bring this population back into the qubit .",
    "this means that after such an event the quantum error correction code will fail to reconstruct the state , as the reconstruction procedure works only if the entire population remains in the qubit states .",
    "we take this possibility into account and obtain estimates that show that the efficiency of quantum error correction is smaller than expected , although the application of quantum error correction allows factorization of somewhat larger numbers than without the use of quantum error correction . in section",
    "iv we will then discuss the prospects of factorization and other applications of quantum computers in view of the results of the present paper .",
    "we conclude that spontaneous emission considerations preclude many applications within the present model of quantum computation .",
    "before we come to the derivation of limits imposed on quantum computation by spontaneous emission we briefly describe the ion trap implementation of the quantum computer @xcite on which we base our considerations .",
    "several ions of mass @xmath2 are trapped in a linear ion trap such that they are lined up and are well separated , ie the next neighbour distance is many wavelengths of the lasers used to manipulate the ions .",
    "this is necessary to be able to address ions separately and can lead to further restrictions on quantum computation in this model @xcite . for a schematic picture see fig .",
    "the motional degrees of freedom of the ions , and especially their collective center - of - mass ( com ) motion with frequency @xmath3 , are cooled to the ground state . in order to be able to implement two - bit gates in this scheme we use the com mode as a bus which allows us to create entanglement between different ions .",
    "this is achieved with an interaction that creates a phonon in the com mode when we deexcite an ion and annihilates a phonon in the com mode when an ion is excited .",
    "this interaction is generated by a laser which is detuned from the transition frequency by @xmath4 . in that case the hamilton operator in the lamb - dicke limit , the rwa and a suitable interaction picture is given by @xcite @xmath5\\ ; ,      \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the lamb - dicke parameter , @xmath7 is the rabi frequency on the @xmath8 transition where levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the corresponding logical values of the qubit .",
    "the denominator @xmath11 originates from the fact that we are considering the com mode which has an effective mass @xmath12 because all @xmath13 ions are oscillating in the trap potential .",
    "the trap has to contain @xmath13 ions , as this is the number of ions that is required to implement shor s algorithm to factorize an @xmath0 bit number @xcite ( actually the correct number is @xmath14 but for simplicity we drop the @xmath15 ) .",
    "it is further assumed that coupling to other vibrational levels can be neglected .",
    "this assumption is a reasonable first approximation as the closest lying vibrational mode has frequency @xmath16 independent of the number of ions in the trap .",
    "nevertheless , this approximation breaks down when the rabi frequency becomes too large , ie . if @xmath17 @xcite . for our considerations of the influence of spontaneous decay we neglect this effect although it may well become important in longer calculations . using the hamilton operator eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) it can be shown that it is possible to construct a cnot gate with only four @xmath18-rotations , and to construct the more involved toffoli gate @xcite with six @xmath18-rotations @xcite . in the following",
    "we will define an elementary time step in terms of the computation time that is required to perform a cnot gate .",
    "all other performance times can be reexpressed in units ofthat of the cnot gate .",
    "the implementation of shor s algorithm also requires a number of one bit operations , ie .",
    "operations that leave the com mode unaffected during their performance .",
    "however , these operations can be performed much faster than two - bit gates , because @xmath19 and also because fewer individual laser pulses are required .",
    "therefore their contribution to calculation time and decoherence is small and will be neglected in the following .",
    "after this short discussion of the ion trap model we will now derive the intensity independent estimates for @xmath0 , first for a qubit which is stored in a metastable two - level transition ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . later in this section we will also consider the case of a qubit stored in zeeman sublevels manipulated by strongly detuned raman pulses ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "first we assume that the two - level approximation holds and derive an expression for the computation time that is required to factorize an @xmath0 bit number . as the next step",
    "we then include in our calculation possible extraneous levels and their spontaneous decay .",
    "as stated above , a cnot gate can be implemented by four @xmath18-pulses according to the hamilton operator eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "this requires an elapsed time @xmath20 which we will call the elementary time step .",
    "it is known @xcite that @xmath21 of these elementary time steps are required to implement shor s algorithm using elementary gates such as one bit gates , cnot gates , toffoli gates and fredkin gates . therefore the total computation time to complete a factorization will be @xmath22 which assumes that the gates are executed one after the other with zero time delay between two gates .",
    "the value of the constant @xmath23 very much depends on the actual practical implementation of shor s algorithm .",
    "the implementation given in @xcite requires @xmath24 cnot gates , @xmath24 toffoli gates and @xmath25 fredkin which result in @xmath26 .",
    "we neglect here all contributions of order @xmath27 which give significant corrections only for small @xmath0 .",
    "if the quantum computation is to give a useful answer , no spontaneous emission is allowed to occur during the whole calculation time @xmath28 , because an emission usually alters the wavefunction of the quantum computer completely .",
    "we will illustrate this point for a quantum computer which performs a discrete fourier transformation ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "qualitatively similar results were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for phase errors .",
    "spontaneous emission in fact leads to two sources of errors .",
    "one , quite obviously , arises from the actual spontaneous emissions in the quantum computer .",
    "the other one is less obvious and is due to the conditional time evolution when no spontaneous emission has taken place .",
    "this time evolution differs from the unit operation because the failure to detect a photon provides us with information about the system which is reflected in a change of the wavefunction @xcite .",
    "first we illustrate the case of an unstable quantum computer which performs a dft on a function which is evaluated at @xmath29 points .",
    "the resulting square modulus of the wavefunction of the quantum computer is compared to the exact result obtained from a absolutely stable quantum computer .",
    "the function on which we perform the dft is given by @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "we have implemented the hamilton operators ( in the lamb - dicke limit ) for all the necessary quantum gates in a linear ion trap @xcite to realize this dft .",
    "in addition to the coherent time evolution we also take into account possible spontaneous emissions from the upper levels of the ions but we neglect all other sources of loss . to calculate the time evolution of the quantum computer",
    ", we then use the quantum jump approach @xcite to simulate the time evolution of a _ single _ quantum computer .",
    "the simulation runs as follows : we generate a random number and compare this random number after each time step with the squared norm of the wavefunction of the quantum computer ( the norm of the wavefunction decreases as it represents the probability that no photon has been emitted ) .",
    "if the squared norm of the wavefunction is smaller than the random number , an emission is deemed to have occured .",
    "we then generate another random number and continue our simulation .",
    "two results of our simulations are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] one emission has taken place during the calculation time of the quantum computer . if we compare the resulting wavefunction with the correct wavefunction , we observe a marked difference between the two . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the wavefunction of an unstable quantum computer which has not suffered a spontaneous emission during the calculation of the dft .",
    "we clearly see that even when no spontaneous emission has taken place , the wavefunction of the quantum computer differs substantially from the correct result .",
    "this difference becomes stronger and stronger the larger the ratio between the computation time @xmath28 and the spontaneous lifetime @xmath32 of the quantum computer becomes .",
    "therefore the wavefunction of the quantum computer will be sufficiently close to the correct result only if the whole computation is finished in a time @xmath28 that is much shorter than the spontaneous lifetime @xmath32 of the quantum computer .",
    "therefore we need to determine the spontaneous lifetime of the quantum computer .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that each ion has an average excitation of @xmath33 during the whole calculation .",
    "the reason for this is that the quantum computer is in a superposition of very many states each of which represents a string of logical states @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the probability to find an atom excited will on average be @xmath33 .",
    "in addition during the computation each ion will suffer many @xmath34 rotations which again leads to an average population of @xmath33 . as the ions are separated by many wavelengths it is reasonable to assume that each ion decays independently of all others with a decay rate of @xmath35 .",
    "as the quantum computer consists of @xmath13 ions the spontaneous lifetime of our quantum computer is @xmath36 therefore we obtain the condition @xmath37 and from that @xmath38 we can now insert eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and obtain @xmath39 where we have isolated the fraction @xmath40 because it can be expressed in a form that is independent of the actual type of transition we are considering ( electric dipole , quadrupole , ... ) .",
    "we find @xmath41 which can be derived along similar lines as in the usual quantum mechanical derivation of the relation between the einstein @xmath42 and @xmath43 coefficient . if we want to reduce the estimated computation time @xmath28 we have to have a ratio @xmath44 which is as large as possible . as the transition frequency",
    "is given by the ion we can adjust only the field strength of the laser .",
    "however , there is an upper limit to this field strength which is approximately given by the field strength between an electron and the proton in a hydrogen atom in its ground state .",
    "the value is @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "this would yield a maximum value of @xmath47 for eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "however , one should note that this field strength is sufficient to destroy the ion within one optical cycle by tunnel ionization @xcite and represents therefore a very hypothetical upper limit .",
    "in fact we will see later in this section that , not surprisingly , other approximations such as the two - level approximation break down much earlier",
    ".    we may use eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) to obtain a first estimate for an upper limit on @xmath0 by requiring that @xmath28 has to be smaller than the decoherence time @xmath48 due to all other decohering processes that may occur , such as collisions , stray fields , phonon losses , laser phase fluctuations ,  .",
    "nevertheless , from a fundamental point of view the situation is not yet entirely satisfying , as in principle higher laser powers and technical improvements concerning the auxiliary decoherence effects could change the estimates quite drastically .",
    "therefore we will now proceed to show that the inclusion of spontaneous emission from auxiliary levels into the dynamics will lead to an estimate for the upper limit of @xmath0 which is entirely _",
    "intensity independent_.    to model the influence of extraneous levels on the decoherence rate due to spontaneous emissions we assume that there is one other level @xmath15 present which couples to both levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 by the same laser that drives the @xmath8 transition . as the contribution of even further detuned levels decreases rapidly with the detuning ( it can be shown that the infinitely many states in the atom give only a finite contribution ) we restrict our treatment to one additional level .",
    "as the laser is strongly detuned from the @xmath49 transitions the population in level @xmath15 will be very small and we can safely assume that the contributions from levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 to the population of level @xmath15 add up .",
    "the population in level @xmath15 will then be @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the rabi frequency on the @xmath49 transition and @xmath52 the detuning on that transition . in eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) we have not taken into account that for very large detuning the rwa is not very good any more .",
    "however , the contribution of all possible atomic levels should be approximated well by eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) .",
    "we have used the notation @xmath53 because the rabi frequency on the @xmath49 transition now depends on the type of the @xmath54 transition .",
    "there are two cases .",
    "\\a ) if the @xmath8 transition is an electric quadrupole transition ( e2 ) then for the excitation of phonons it is necessary to place the ion at the antinode of the electric field of the laser .",
    "then the same laser on an electric dipole transition ( e1 ) will , in leading order , leave the com mode untouched .",
    "this implies that @xmath55    \\b ) if the @xmath8 transition is an electric octupole transition ( e3 ) then for the excitation of phonons it is necessary to place the ion at the node of the electric field of the laser",
    ". then the same laser on an electric dipole transition ( e1 ) will also excite phonons in the com mode .",
    "this implies that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the lamb - dicke parameter on the @xmath49 transition .",
    "we will have to distinguish between the two possibilities a ) and b ) , the first of which occurs for example in @xmath58,@xmath59 and @xmath60 while the second one occurs in @xmath61 ( an ion which might allow factorization of very large numbers according to estimates which do not include spontaneous emission @xcite ) .",
    "we first deal with case a ) and then state the result for case b ) . in case",
    "a ) we obtain @xmath62 as in the pure two - level case , we want to be sure that no spontaneous emission will take place during the whole calculation , neither from level @xmath10 nor from level @xmath15 .",
    "this implies the condition @xmath63 we now use eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) and @xmath64 which derives from eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) and where @xmath65 is the decay rate of level @xmath15 on the @xmath54 transition and @xmath66 the corresponding transition frequency . inserting eqs .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) we obtain @xmath67 where we have assumed that @xmath68 , ie .",
    "level @xmath10 only decays back into state @xmath9 . for case b ) we obtain a slightly different result which nevertheless has a very similar structure .",
    "we find @xmath69 where we have used the fact that the lamb - dicke parameter depends on the transition frequency so that @xmath70 it is important to note that the expressions eqs .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) are _ independent _ of the laser power as long as @xmath71 .",
    "this independence has its origin in the fact that increasing the laser power gives rise to two competing effects .",
    "it decreases the computation time @xmath28 given in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) and therefore decreases the probability for an emission from level @xmath15 . on the other hand",
    "an increased laser power increases the population in level @xmath15 which increases the probability for a spontaneous emission .",
    "both effects cancel , leading to the intensity independent results eqs .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) .    in table 1",
    "we give values for the bounds eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) for realistic ions .",
    "the values for @xmath72 and @xmath73 were calculated using eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) as the qubit transition is quadrupole allowed , while @xmath74 with an octupole allowed qubit transition is an example of case b ) and is therefore calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "we calculate the values for @xmath0 assuming @xmath75 , which is the most optimistic choice , and for two values of the lamb - dicke parameter : an optimistic @xmath76 and the more realistic @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "we see that the numbers that may be factorized on a quantum computer using metastable optical transitions are very small even for the optimistic choice @xmath76 .",
    "only the @xmath74 ion gives results from which one may hope to factorize at least small numbers .",
    "however , it should be realized that it is extremely difficult to drive the hyperstable qubit transition in @xmath74 sufficiently quickly to finish the calculation in a reasonable time .",
    "if we assume a ratio @xmath78 where @xmath79 then from eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) we find for @xmath76 the value @xmath80 for a @xmath81 bit number .",
    "this is so long that it is very unlikely that one can isolate the system during that time from all other decoherence sources .",
    "therefore the practical limit to @xmath0 for @xmath74 is probably smaller than the one given in table 1 .",
    "so far we have dealt with the case where the qubit is stored in a metastable optical transition .",
    "this method certainly has the disadvantage that at practically all times the quantum computer has a mean excitation of about @xmath33 per qubit .",
    "therefore , even if a qubit does not take part in a quantum gate operation , the qubit will decohere due to spontaneous emissions from the excited state of the qubit . to circumvent this problem",
    "one would like to store the qubits in zeeman sublevels of a stable ground state .",
    "in that case stored qubits do not suffer any decoherence due to spontaneous emissions .",
    "however , how do we manipulate the qubit ?",
    "it is unfortunately not practical to drive the qubit with a microwave field directly because the very long wavelength of this radiation does not allow us to address single ions as they can not be separated far enough in a linear trap .",
    "therefore we have to use a different method of manipulating the qubit .",
    "this method uses the presence of another level @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) which is coupled to the two qubit levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 by two lasers of rabi frequency @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "each laser is strongly detuned from its transition , and its rabi frequency is much smaller than the detuning .",
    "however , it is assumed that both detunings are equal , ie .",
    "the two photon detuning vanishes while the one photon detuning @xmath84 is large .",
    "the advantage of this method is that due to the strong detuning @xmath84 the population in level @xmath15 is small , so that spontaneous emissions from that level are rare .",
    "a hamilton operator that implements an interaction analogous to the one generated by eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , ie the qubit is excited while a phonon in the com mode is deexcited and vice versa , is given by @xmath85      +      \\frac{\\hbar\\eta\\omega_{12}}{2\\sqrt{5l } }      \\left [ |2\\rangle\\langle 1| a   +      |1\\rangle\\langle 2| a^{\\dagger}\\right ]      \\ ; ,      \\label{19}\\ ] ] where again the lamb - dicke limit , the rwa and a suitable interaction picture is used . to make sure that the raman transitions have the effect as full rabi oscillations between levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 the condition @xmath86 has to be satisfied which we will assume in the following",
    ". the condition eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) can be obtained from the solution of the time evolution @xmath87 which is valid for @xmath88 and for an initial state @xmath89 . to obtain @xmath90 for some @xmath91 eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) has to be satisfied .",
    "before we continue we have to realize that it is indeed enough to consider the time evolution eqs .",
    "( [ 21]-[23 ] ) and the corresponding time evolution for the initial condition @xmath92 . to see this we realize that to a good approximation the coherences between levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 are uniformly distributed . averaging the initial state over this distribution",
    "then yields a mixed state as an initial state in which both states @xmath9 and @xmath10 have equal weight . therefore calculating the time evolution for both possible initial states",
    "separately and averaging over the two results leads to the final result .    again in the raman pulse implementation of qubits a cnot gate can be implemented with four @xmath18 pulses . from the solution eqs .",
    "( [ 21]-[23 ] ) we see that the effective rabi frequency of the qubit transition is given by @xmath93 therefore the performance of a cnot gate requires the time @xmath94 again the probability for a spontaneous emission from level @xmath15 has to be small , ie .",
    "@xmath95 this condition immediately yields @xmath96 which is already intensity independent . from eq .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) one could conclude that one is able to factorize gigantic numbers by making the ratio @xmath97 sufficiently large , eg . @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    "would lead to @xmath100 .",
    "but again this reasoning is invalid because we have neglected the fact that the two - level approximation breaks down because in the ion other levels , which we model by a level @xmath101 , also couple to levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 via the raman pulses .",
    "this additional coupling is very important because it potentially involves levels that may have @xmath102 .",
    "in addition the presence of level @xmath101 changes the effective rabi frequency in the qubit and may therefore lead to additional errors .",
    "finally there is a limit to the size of @xmath84 from the nature of the qubit quantum numbers , as usually states @xmath9 and @xmath10 are hyperfine levels which require a nuclear spin flip which is precluded for very large @xmath84 .    to achieve a more restrictive , but again intensity independent , upper bound for @xmath0 than the one given in eq .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) we now take into account the presence of one more level @xmath101 which acquires population during the execution of the quantum gate",
    ". one can give a complete analysis of the full four level system ; however , this is very tedious , although not complicated in principle . in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to two limiting cases where the analysis is simpler and already reveals the basic physics .",
    "we avoid an intermediate regime which is also not of practical interest as the precise control of the qubits will be difficult . if we denote the rabi frequencies on the @xmath103 transition by @xmath104 and the one photon detuning as @xmath105 we can distinguish two cases , one of which reduces to the analysis given above , the other one requiring further investigation .",
    "first consider the case where @xmath106 in that case the analysis given above , neglecting level @xmath101 , was not correct as the influence of level @xmath101 on the dynamics of the qubit is actually larger than that of level @xmath15 .",
    "for example the proper effective rabi flopping frequency of the qubit is then given by @xmath107 instead of @xmath108 .",
    "due to relation eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) we can conclude from eq .",
    "( [ 28 ] ) that @xmath109 and therefore @xmath110 in fact what one has to do is to redo the analysis leading to eq .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) but replacing level @xmath15 by level @xmath101 .",
    "the other case is given by @xmath111 which means that indeed level @xmath15 determines the dynamics of the system .",
    "in that case we immediately find @xmath112 where @xmath105 and @xmath113 is more or less determined because the lasers are extremely far detuned from the @xmath114 transitions .",
    "this could already serve as a strong limit for @xmath0 , however , it is of a different structure compared to the intensity independent limit eqs .",
    "( [ 16]-[17 ] ) for the two - level case .",
    "it is interesting to note that it is possible to construct a limit which has a form completely analogous to eqs .",
    "( [ 16]-[17 ] ) only with slightly different exponents . for this derivation",
    "we assume that level @xmath15 influences the qubit dynamics the most , ie .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this assumption itself together with @xmath115 ( detuned raman pulses ) yields a lower limit to the computation time @xmath116 we will see from this expression for the computation time that any system with an exceedingly high lifetime of level @xmath15 is practically useless for quantum computation because the time required to perform a computation is extremely high .",
    "again of course it is important to distinguish between the cases a ) and b ) for the different types of qubit transitions ( electric quadrupole , octupole , .. ) as we have done when we investigated the case of a two - level system as a qubit .",
    "we will treat case a ) explicitly in the following while we only state the result for case b ) .    to calculate the influence of level @xmath101 to the decoherence we first have to find out the average population in that level .",
    "for this let us realize that during the implementation of a cnot a full @xmath117-rotation will be performed .",
    "that means that on average the population in both levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 is equal .",
    "therefore the much slower coupling to level @xmath101 sees an averaged population in both levels with no average coherence .",
    "we can therefore average over two contributions to @xmath118 which originate from the initial states @xmath119 and @xmath120 and we obtain @xmath121 where @xmath57 is the lamb - dicke parameter for the @xmath122 transition .",
    "( [ 33 ] ) contains an additional factor @xmath123 compared to eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that level @xmath101 is strongly decaying and that therefore @xmath124 .",
    "note also that the roles of the lasers on the @xmath114 transitions has been reversed compared to their role on the @xmath49 transitions ; the phonon is now destroyed by an excitation from level @xmath9 and not from level @xmath10 anymore .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath114 transitions are dipole allowed ( e1 ) while the @xmath49 transition is quadrupole allowed ( e2 ) .",
    "again an emission from level @xmath101 should not occur during the whole calculation which means @xmath125 now we have to find out which term in the brackets of eq .",
    "( [ 34 ] ) is dominant . because we need @xmath126 ,",
    "( [ 20 ] ) , and because we are in the lamb - dicke limit , ie .",
    "@xmath127 , the laser on the @xmath128 transition has to be weaker than the one on the @xmath129 transition",
    ". but again @xmath130 and therefore @xmath131 .",
    "this implies @xmath132 where we have inserted the decay coefficients @xmath133 from level @xmath134 to level @xmath135 to be able to apply eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) which then yields @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the electric field of the laser on the @xmath49 transition .",
    "we now define the constant @xmath138 and resolve eq .",
    "( [ 36 ] ) for @xmath0 to obtain @xmath139 note that @xmath140 as argued below eq .",
    "( [ 34 ] ) and that the ratio of the decay coefficients in @xmath141 will be of the order of @xmath10 . therefore @xmath141 is much smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , because of @xmath126 , is a good approximation to assume @xmath142 ( with @xmath143 defined below eq .",
    "( [ 39 ] ) ) which then yields @xmath144 following very similar lines we obtain for case b ) @xmath145 where now @xmath146 is of the order of @xmath10 . both limits",
    "( [ 38]-[39 ] ) are analogous in their form to the estimates eqs .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) if we neglect in eqs .",
    "( [ 16 ] - [ 17 ] ) the contribution from the upper level @xmath10 coupling to level @xmath101 .",
    "in table 2 we present some values for @xmath0 calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ 38a ] ) and ( [ 39 ] ) for the same ions as in table 1 .",
    "again we assume that @xmath147 ( an optimistic choice ) and observe that the resulting limits for the numbers that can be factorized on a quantum computer are very small , especially if @xmath77 .",
    "nevertheless one could think that transitions in @xmath148 and @xmath149 are promising .",
    "however , two effects appear which lead to further limitations .",
    "one is the fact that eqs .",
    "( [ 38a ] ) and ( [ 39 ] ) are not necessarily more restrictive than the equivalent of eq .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) for level @xmath101 as we have assumed eq .",
    "( [ 32 ] ) which does not need to be true .",
    "in fact simply applying eq .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) where @xmath150 is replaced by @xmath113 yields for @xmath151 @xmath152 , for @xmath148 @xmath153 and for @xmath149 @xmath154 which are somewhat smaller than the values for those ions in table 2 .",
    "secondly and more importantly the promising results for @xmath148 and @xmath149 are illusionary because a very stable transition is also very slow . from eq .",
    "( [ 32a ] ) we can easily calculate that the factorization time using @xmath148 and assuming @xmath76 is @xmath155 which gives for @xmath156 a value of @xmath157 during which no decohering event of any kind is allowed to happen .",
    "this is a very long time and it will be difficult to isolate the quantum computer from the environment . for @xmath149 the numbers are even more devastating .",
    "we obtain @xmath158 which indicates for @xmath159 that @xmath160 , a completely unrealistic number .",
    "this again shows very clearly that the solution to the problem of decoherence can not be to employ extremely stable transitions for qubits but to find methods that enable the quantum computer to cope with a certain level of decoherence , ie we need a form of quantum error correction . in principle",
    "it is indeed possible to implement quantum error correction in quantum computers but it remains the question inasmuch these methods will in fact improve the prospects of quantum computation . in the next section we will address this problem and derive limitations to quantum factoring including the use of quantum error correction methods .",
    "in the preceding section we derived intensity independent upper bounds for the numbers that can be factorized on a quantum computer . the results that we obtained are not very promising as they rule out the possibility to factorize large numbers ( numbers with @xmath161 can be factorized on a classical computer ) on a quantum computer . however , in these estimates we have yet to include the possibility of quantum error correction @xcite and fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite . these methods",
    "have the ability to change drastically the probability that the calculation becomes corrupted by an emission .",
    "for example , consider a quantum error correction code that can correct a single general error .",
    "if the probability to suffer an error is @xmath162 then the probability to suffer two errors , an event that can not be corrected by the code , is @xmath163 .",
    "therefore , we have reduced the probability for a fatal error from @xmath164 to @xmath163 and it is then possible to perform quadratically as many computational steps as possible without quantum error correction . higher order correcting codes",
    "promise even higher gains in possible computational steps .",
    "however , this simple argument neglects two effects that counteract the expected benefits of quantum error correction codes .",
    "one reason is the quite obvious fact that the implementation of quantum error correction and fault - tolerant quantum computation requires substantial overheads in additional qubits for encoding the qubits and additional quantum gate operations to implement quantum logic operations on the encoded quantum bits",
    ". this overhead can be quite substantial even for simple quantum error correction codes .",
    "the other effect is less obvious but can have an even stronger impact on the practical efficiency of quantum error correction codes .",
    "the problem is that quantum error correction codes loose their ability to correct for decohering events if population leaves the qubit as a result of the decohering event .",
    "therefore we have to hope that all population will remain within the system representing the qubit .",
    "however , as we have seen in the analysis of section ii this will not be the case for a realistic implementation of a qubit .",
    "the reason is simply that the two - level approximation is never perfectly satisfied .",
    "if we excite an extraneous level then an emission from this level does not necessarily bring the population back into the qubit .",
    "an error of this kind can not be dealt with by a quantum error correction code .",
    "one would have to find ways to repump the lost population back into the qubit .",
    "this , however , is quite difficult if not impossible because of the sheer multitude of possible levels where the spontaneous emission may lead the population to .    in this section",
    "we will first consider the case of quantum computation using two - level systems to represent the qubits .",
    "subsequently we will then consider the representation of qubits in zeeman sublevels using far detuned raman pulses for their manipulation .    before we start with the discussion of the two - level system case , we first define two constants , @xmath165 and @xmath166 , describing the necessary overheads in the number of qubits and the number of additional quantum gate operations .    * the number of required qubits rises by a factor of @xmath165 as all qubits will have to be encoded and will be kept encoded during the calculation .",
    "repeated decoding and encoding would raise the number of operations substantially and lead to unnecessary errors . * the number of operations required to implement one quantum logical operation on encoded qubits rises by a factor of @xmath166 because we have to perform more than one quantum gate to implement one quantum logic operation on the encoded qubits .",
    "in addition we also have to perform quantum error corrections periodically .    the value of the factors @xmath165 and @xmath166 depends heavily on the quantum error correction code that is used .",
    "if one wants to protect a single qubit against one general error , then it is known that @xmath167 is the minimal possible value @xcite .",
    "the number @xmath166 for this code is uncertain in general for the most optimal codes but is at least @xmath168 for a cnot gate @xcite and probably much more for other gates such as a toffoli gate .      for the following analysis",
    "we assume an error correction code capable of correcting one error .",
    "a similar calculation will then yield the result for codes that can correct @xmath169 errors and we simply state these results .",
    "first we need to find the time required to perform a cnot operation on encoded quantum bits .",
    "the computer contains @xmath165 times more qubits , ie .",
    "qubits , and @xmath166 times more operations are required .",
    "therefore @xmath171 the spontaneous lifetime of the quantum computer is then @xmath172 as we now have the ability to correct for errors during the calculation , we no longer need to require that there is practically no spontaneous emission during the whole calculation .",
    "instead we ask for the probability @xmath173 to have one error during @xmath174 logical operations of our algorithm to be small compared to @xmath10 .",
    "we find @xmath175 if we perform a fault - tolerant error correction after these n operations then this correction will fail with probability @xmath176 , the probability to have suffered two errors , because the code is not designed to correct for two errors .",
    "therefore the probability that the whole computation fails is given by @xmath177 this immediately implies that @xmath178 is the optimal choice unless we take the @xmath174 dependence of @xmath166 into account which is however quite difficult as @xmath166 is not known very well . for the following we will assume @xmath178 and we obtain @xmath179 from eq .",
    "( [ 44 ] ) we easily deduce the total computation time @xmath180 again eqs .",
    "( [ 44 ] ) and ( [ 45 ] ) are dependent on the laser power driving the system . to eliminate this intensity dependence we now have to take other levels into account as we did in section ii .",
    "again we have to distinguish the two cases a ) ( qubit transition is quadrupole allowed ) and",
    "b ) ( qubit transition is octupole allowed ) depending on the nature of the qubit transition .",
    "we first treat case a ) and then state the result for case b ) .    to keep the resulting expressions more transparent we neglect the contribution of the upper qubit level @xmath10 to the violation of the two - level approximation .",
    "the generalization to this case is easy.we then find for the population in the extraneous level @xmath15 @xmath181 now we want to know the probability @xmath182 that an emission from level @xmath15 which leads to population _ outside _ the qubit transition occurs during the whole computation .",
    "it is very important to note that it is this probability @xmath182 that has to be much smaller than unity because even a single emission leading out of the qubit can not be corrected by the quantum error correction code .",
    "we find @xmath183 this can be solved for @xmath0 and with eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) we obtain @xmath184 with an analogous calculation we obtain for case b ) @xmath185 the estimates eqs .",
    "( [ 48 ] ) and ( [ 49 ] ) are valid for a quantum error correction code that is able to correct for one error .",
    "one can quite easily extend these results to quantum error correction codes that are able to correct for @xmath169 errors .",
    "we state only the main results for the cases a ) and b ) as they can be derived easily along the lines that lead us to eqs .",
    "( [ 48 ] ) and ( [ 49 ] ) . for case",
    "a ) we obtain the computation time @xmath186 now we take into account other levels outside the qubit transition . a spontaneous emission that leads from these levels out of the qubit system",
    "can not be corrected for by the quantum error correction code .",
    "therefore we obtain @xmath187 for case b ) we obtain the result @xmath188 again we can now discuss numerical values for eqs .",
    "( [ 48 ] ) and ( [ 49 ] ) obtained from the atomic data of real ions . in table 3",
    "we give the results for eqs .",
    "( [ 48 ] ) and ( [ 49 ] ) .",
    "we see that although the estimates have improved they still restrict factorization to very small numbers especially for a lamb - dicke parameter @xmath77 where we obtain upper limits that restrict the numbers that are possible to factorize to trivial sizes .",
    "again @xmath149 seems to be very promising but again we should note that it is very hard to actually drive the this transition sufficiently quickly so that the computation times quickly reach astronomical values .",
    "for @xmath78 we obtain for @xmath159 a value of @xmath189 , a value which is extremely high . for @xmath148",
    "we obtain for @xmath159 , @xmath78 and @xmath76 the value @xmath190 .",
    "now we perform the same analysis including quantum error correction codes for the case where the qubits is stored in zeeman sublevels .",
    "of course the analysis here runs along similar lines as the one for the two - level system and that of section ii .",
    "therefore we only state the final result for the cases a ) and b ) .",
    "we present the results for an error correcting code which is able to correct @xmath169 errors .",
    "we only treat the case where the extraneous levels give a small correction to the time evolution of the system , ie we assume the regime of eq .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) . for the computation time",
    "we obtain the lower limit @xmath191 for both cases a ) and b ) . for case",
    "a ) we obtain the estimate @xmath192 where @xmath193 @xmath137 denotes the electric field strength of the laser on the @xmath194 transition .",
    "note that again we have to take into account that @xmath141 contains a hidden dependence on @xmath195 and @xmath165 .",
    "this dependence is due to the fact that we have to satisfy the condition @xmath196 therefore @xmath197 ( @xmath143 is defined in ( [ 57 ] ) ) and we obtain @xmath198 for case b ) we obtain a very similar result .",
    "we find @xmath199 where @xmath200 assuming that @xmath201 we then obtain the values given in table 4 which again seem to be promising if we assume @xmath76 . for the more realistic values of @xmath77 , however , the estimate reduces substantially . in the discussion of table 2",
    "we already pointed out that high values for the estimates on @xmath0 alone do not suffice to allow a practical implementation of quantum factoring .",
    "important also is that the computation time be sufficiently short .",
    "this restriction again excludes @xmath149 immediately because for @xmath202 and @xmath159 we obtain @xmath203days .",
    "it also makes @xmath148 a very unlikely candidate for successful factorization as for @xmath156 we obtain with the same parameters as for @xmath149 the value @xmath204 .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the constraints imposed by spontaneous emission onto factorization of big numbers using a quantum computer . in section",
    "ii we have investigated the possibility of factorization without the use of quantum error correction .",
    "we were able to derive limits to the bitsize of the numbers that can be factorized on a quantum computer .",
    "these limits are _ independent _ of the intensity of the laser that is used to implement quantum gates .",
    "this intensity independence was achieved by taking into account the failure of the two - level approximation even for modest laser powers .",
    "the result of these limits is that without the use of quantum error correction the factorization even of small numbers will not be possible .",
    "therefore we then investigated in section iii whether the implementation of quantum error correction can improve the prospects of factorization on a quantum computer .",
    "it turned out that quantum error correction in realistic atomic systems is much less effective than in the ideal case of closed two - level systems because the failure of the two - level approximation can lead to a leakage of population out of the system which can not be corrected by a quantum error correction code .",
    "therefore even high order quantum error correction codes are susceptible to single errors that lead to loss of population out of the system which corrupts their performance .",
    "nevertheless the upper limits in this case are higher than without quantum error correction .",
    "however , the total computation time using quantum error correction , and even in the case without quantum error correction , tends to be very large because a very stable transition can not be driven very fast .",
    "we find lower bounds for the computation times and conclude that even for moderate numbers it will be difficult to isolate the system from the environment such that no decohering event , other than a spontaneous emission , can take place . at this point",
    "other decoherence effects have to be taken into account ( see eg .",
    "however , we think that even the sole inclusion of spontaneous emission as a decohering effect already shows that the practical application of quantum computers in factorization of big numbers will be highly unlikely within the present models of quantum computation . the considerations of this paper also apply to other possible algorithms for quantum computers if they also require @xmath205 operations .    although the conclusions of this paper are rather pessimistic with regard to the practical application of quantum computers for actual computations we would like to stress that there are applications such as for example in precision spectroscopy @xcite which require much less operations , @xmath206 , and for which therefore the above presented estimates will be much more optimistic . we believe that in this area interesting applications of the concept of quantum computing will be found .",
    "however , unrealistic hopes that have been raised in the past about the practicality of quantum computers have to be moderated .",
