    "eclipsing binary star systems are of immense value as our primary source of empirical measurements of the properties of stars @xcite .",
    "the masses and radii of those systems which show double - lined spectra can be measured using purely geometrical arguments and to precisions of better than 1% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "with effective temperature determinations they become excellent distance indicators both within the milky way and to external galaxies @xcite . detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) are the pick of the bunch as their properties can be used to challenge stellar theory and single - star evolutionary models .",
    "one use of debs is to probe chemical peculiarities , such as the am phenomenon in stars @xcite by measuring their physical properties to high accuracy .",
    "am stars are astars which show photospheric abundance anomalies thought to be caused by radiative diffusion and gravitational settling .",
    "these effects are able to operate in the radiative atmospheres possessed by astars with rotational velocities slower than roughly 100kms@xmath12  @xcite .",
    "am stars are preferentially found in short - period binaries where tidal effects have been able to slow their rotation @xcite .",
    "this in turn means that am stars are strongly represented among the well - studied debsjkt / debdata / debs.html ] , such as @xmath13aur @xcite , v364lac @xcite , v624her @xcite , v459cas @xcite , wwcam @xcite and rrlyn @xcite .",
    "the prevailing viewpoint from these studies is that the am phenomenon is a surface disease  the properties of am stars can in general be matched by theoretical predictions just as well as those of normal astars  although a high bulk metal abundance ( 5% by mass ) was found for the component stars of wwaurigae by @xcite .",
    "xyceti is a deb containing am stars which has been studied on many occasions but whose physical properties were not firmly established . in this work we present new spectroscopy and extensive photometric measurements from the superwasp survey from which we measure the physical properties of the component stars to high precision .",
    "this study highlights the many possibilities opening up for the study of eclipsing binaries of all types from the increasing number of long - term variability surveys , in particular those which have the photometric precision to search for extrasolar planetary transits .",

    "atm ] we have measured the distance to the xycet system using the method of @xcite , which is based on calibrations between @xmath19  and surface brightness obtained from interferometry @xcite .",
    "an interstellar reddening of @xmath20 is needed to obtain agreement between the distances found in the optical ( @xmath21 ) and near - infrared ( @xmath22 ) passbands .",
    "the most precise distance measurement is found in the @xmath23-band , primarily because of its relative insensitivity to reddening and @xmath19 , and is @xmath24pc .",
    "consistent distances are found using the bolometric - correction technique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and empirical or theoretical bolometric corrections from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the good agreement between the distances for the two stars in the same passbands is supporting evidence that the light ratio obtained from the light curve is correct .",
    "a comparison of the masses , radii and @xmath19s of xycet to several sets of theoretical models of stellar evolution @xcite has been performed .",
    "we find that the best match corresponds to a solar helium and metal abundance and an age in the region of @xmath25myr , but the mass  radius relation of the deb is less steep than predicted by any of the models .",
    "an enhanced helium or metal abundance can improve the agreement in the mass  radius plane , but at the expense of the agreement in the mass@xmath19  plane .",
    "we conclude that the components of xycet appear to be discrepant with respect to theoretical predictions , but that the discord is smallest for solar - composition models .",
    "xycet is an eclipsing binary containing two components which show the am phenomenon .",
    "it has been studied many times previously , but without agreement on the radii of the stars and based predominantly on photographic spectra .",
    "we have measured the physical properties of the two stars from new phase - resolved ccd spectroscopy and an extensive light curve obtained by the superwasp survey for transiting planets .",
    "the spectra were analysed using cross - correlation and spectral disentangling techniques , and the light curve was modelled using the jktebop code .",
    "we measured the effective temperatures of the stars by fitting their h@xmath26 line profiles , finding good agreement with values from calibration against strmgren indices .",
    "our spectroscopic data cover only a narrow wavelength region so are not useful for a detailed chemical abundance analysis .",
    "qualitative conclusions have therefore been obtained by comparing the disentangled spectra of the two components to synthetic spectra calculated for the atmospheric parameters of the stars . we find that both stars demonstrate a clear overabundance of iron - group elements and an obvious deficiency of calcium and scandium , as expected for am stars",
    ". further confirmation of their metallic - lined nature comes from the detection of strongly enhanced abundances of zirconium and the rare - earth elements lanthanium , cerium and neodymium .",
    "the physical properties of xycet are measured to accuracies of 1% in mass , 2% in radius and 125k in @xmath19 .",
    "we find that the stars are rotating close to synchronicity with the orbital velocity .",
    "the system is located at a distance of @xmath24pc .",
    "theoretical models of stellar evolution are able to match the @xmath19s of the stars for the measured masses , but predict a steeper slope in the mass  radius diagram than observed .    the physical properties of the component stars of xycet are not clearly different from those of normal astars , supporting the interpretation of the am phenomenon as a surface effect which does not significantly affect the evolution of stars .",
    "the chemical peculiarities and relatively slow rotation of both components mean that xycet is a promising target for an extensive spectroscopic investigation of the photospheres of metallic - lined stars with accurately known masses , radii and @xmath19s .",
