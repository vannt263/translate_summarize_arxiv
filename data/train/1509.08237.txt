    "turbulence at kinetic scales is often referred to as kinetic alfvn turbulence .",
    "theoretical models have shown that kinetic alfvn turbulence is generated naturally through an anisotropic alfvn wave cascade produced by interactions among counterstreaming alfvn wave packets ( e.g. , kraichnan 1965 ; goldreich & sridhar 1995 ; quataert & gruzinov 1999 ; cranmer & van ballegooijen 2003 ; schekochihin et al .",

    "transition of alfvnic turbulence from mhd to kinetic scales depends strongly on the plasma thermal to magnetic pressure ratio ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "for example , the low - frequency turbulent cascade first arrives to the ion gyroradius scale in @xmath1 plasmas and to the electron inertial scale in @xmath2 plasmas , where @xmath3 is the electron to ion mass ratio ( e.g. , zhao et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "when the cascade reaches kinetic scales , the kolomogorov - like spectrum @xmath4 of perpendicular magnetic and electric fluctuations transforms into the steeper @xmath5 for the magnetic spectrum and the flatter @xmath6 for the electric spectrum ( e.g. , schekochihin et al .",
    "the anisotropic scaling @xmath7 at mhd scales becomes @xmath8 ( for @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 ( for @xmath2 ) at kinetic scales ( zhao et al .",
    "2013 ) , where @xmath11and @xmath12 are the wavenumbers parallel and perpendicular to the background magnetic field @xmath13 . therefore , with the increasing @xmath12 the parallel wavenumber @xmath14 and the alfvn wave frequency @xmath15 are also increasing , where @xmath16 is the alfvn speed .",
    "when the parallel wave scale approaches the ion inertial length @xmath17 , the alfvn wave frequency approaches the ion - cyclotron frequency @xmath18 , @xmath19 . at this point",
    "the low - frequency @xmath20 kinetic alfvn turbulence transforms into the high - frequency @xmath21 kinetic alfvn ( sometimes named  quasi - perpendicular whistler \" ) turbulence .",
    "observations support the idea that high - frequency alfvn waves can be generated by low - frequency alfvn waves via turbulent cascade ( huang et al .",
    "linear theories also agree that the kinetic alfvn branch can extend from low- to high - frequency domain ( sahraoui et al .",
    "2012 ; vsconez et al .",
    "2014 ; zhao et al .",
    "2014b ) .",
    "it is not yet certain what effects make observed turbulent spectra @xmath22  ( alexandrova et al . 2012 ; sahraoui et al . 2013 ) steeper than the regular turbulent spectrum of kaws @xmath23(see schekochihin et al .",
    "2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "two feasible mechanisms discussed recently are landau damping ( howes et al .",
    "2011 ) and intermittency ( boldyrev & perez 2012 ) .",
    "if the turbulent cascade generates high - frequency kaw , the spectra can be modified by dispersive effects of finite @xmath24 .",
    "high - frequency kaws undergo also ion - cyclotron wave - particle interactions ( e.g. , voitenko & goossens 2002 ) , which can contribute to the turbulent spectra in addition to landau damping .",
    "kinetic damping leads to the plasma heating and particles acceleration both along and across @xmath25 , connecting particles to waves in the solar - terrestrial environments ( marsch 2006 ) .",
    "high - frequency effects in alfvnic turbulence are understood much less than the low - frequency ones .",
    "here we use a two - fluid plasma model to investigate dispersive effects ( in particular , of finite @xmath26  @xmath24 ) and intermittency in alfvnic turbulence and explore the wavenumber and frequency spectra from mhd to kinetic scales .",
    "influence of damping on the turbulent spectra is not taken into account , which restricts applicability of our results to the cases where spectral modifications due to damping are weak in comparison to the modifications due to dispersion and intermittency . in discussion",
    "we argue this is often the case in the solar wind .    in the next section",
    "we introduce a model for anisotropic alfvnic turbulence and corresponding wavenumber spectra .",
    "the steady spectra in the frequency space are presented in section 3 .",
    "effects introduced by the turbulent intermittency are described in section 4 .",
    "section 5 presents the spectral distributions in solar flare loops and in solar wind at 1 au .",
    "section 6 discusses impacts of the injection scales , intermittency and dissipative effects .",
    "the last section presents a summary of obtained results . in appendix a the analytical expressions of the wave variables and their spectral distributions are derived for low-@xmath0 plasmas , and in appendix b the analytical results are extended to the case of intermittent turbulence .",
    "the steady - state spectral properties of alfvnic turbulence can be investigated phenomenologically using a model developed by ( e.g. , schekochihin et al .",
    "2009 ) , where turbulence is stirred initially through collisions of counterstreaming alfvn wave - packets at the ( spatial and temporal ) mhd scales . in the collisions ,",
    "the local wave - wave interaction condition as well as the critical balance condition are assumed to be satisfied .",
    "the latter corresponds to strong alfvnic turbulence where the nonlinear timescale becomes as short as the linear timescale .    to obtain the steady - state spectrum ,",
    "one makes use of linear responses of the alfvn mode , namely the quasilinear premise ( schekochihin et al .",
    "2009 ; howes et al . 2011a ; zhao et al .",
    "therefore , for the spectrum of the high - frequency kinetic - scale alfvnic turbulence , one needs the linear relations for high - frequency kinetic alfvn wave ( kaw ) .",
    "recently , zhao et al .",
    "( 2014b ) derived the linear kaw responses at parallel length - scales extending down to the ion inertial length and below , with corresponding frequencies extending to @xmath27 and above .",
    "below we use these results to obtain the high - frequency alfvnic turbulent spectra and scalings .    in the case of local nonlinear interactions , the spectral energy flux can be written as @xcite , @xmath28where @xmath29 is of order unity , @xmath30 is the perpendicular electron velocity fluctuation , and @xmath31 is the perpendicular magnetic fluctuation in velocity units , @xmath32 . using the relation @xmath33we get @xmath34where the normalized frequency of oblique alfvn waves is ( zhao et al . 2014b ) @xmath35 ^{1/2 } ,   \\label{3}\\]]with the definitions @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",

    "note since the magnetic field is frozen into the electron before the turbulence cascading into electron gyroradius scale , the electron velocity @xmath30 is used to estimate the nonlinear turnover time .",
    "linear relations between electric and magnetic fluctuations are given by @xmath49and @xmath50where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "note that the turbulence scalings in plasmas @xmath65 is nearly the same as that in @xmath66 due to the similar properties of kaws in these plasma environments .",

    "it is seen that the turbulent cascade arrives to the high ion cyclotron frequencies at the perpendicular scales that are already smaller than the ion gyroradius scale .",

    "the power - low part of the spectrum ( @xmath189 )  may be formed by the intermittent turbulence with sheet - like structure ( boldyrev & perez 2012 ) , and steeper observed spectra can be formed by adding tube - like structures .",
    "the exponential spectrum drop at @xmath190implies the appearance of the dissipation range , and may be caused by the strong electron landau damping ( tenbarge & howes 2013 ) .",

    "( 2013 ) ( see also huang et al .",
    "2014 ) , one needs further analysis of the possible production of high frequencies and their contribution to the frequency spectra measured in the spacecraft frame .",
    "it should also be noted that the anisotropy scaling is @xmath195  for intermittent low - frequency kaw turbulence formed by the sheet - like fluctuations ( boldyrev & perez 2012 ) . the mentioned above problems call for further investigations of the role of intermittency in kinetic alfvn turbulence .      in the low - frequency kinetic alfvn turbulence ,",
    "possessing parallel electric fields , the proton and electron landau damping may dissipate the turbulent energy and influence spectral transfer . in this study we neglected these dissipative effects , as well as the ion - cyclotron resonant damping , which needs justifications . to this end",
    "we note that even the strongest resonant damping , based on the maxwellian velocity distributions , does not prevent the super - ion - cyclotron kaws from propagation .",
    "this can be directly seen from figs .",
    "3 - 9 by sahraoui et al .",
    "( 2012 ) or fig . 4 by vsconez et al .",
    "( 2014 ) showing the kaw kinetic dispersion and damping .",
    "even with fixed maxwellian velocity distributions , many dispersion curves , corresponding to different propagation angles , extend continuously from sub- to super - ion - cyclotron frequencies without being heavily damped .",

    "cranmer & van ballegooijen ( 2003 ) and podesta et al . (",
    "2010 ) have shown that the magnetic spectrum of low - frequency kinetic alfvn turbulence experiences a fast fall - off between ion and electron scales if the landau damping is accounted for .",
    "the frequency spectrum @xmath200 , obtained in numerical simulations by tenbarge & howes ( 2012 ) for @xmath201 , is also much steeper than our @xmath202  spectrum , which indicates a strong landau damping in their simulations .",
    "indeed , podesta et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and tenbarge and howes ( 2012 ) used the linear landau damping ( @xmath203 )  assuming maxwellian velocity distributions of plasma species .",
    "however , this approximation can hardly be applied to the solar wind where essentially non - maxwellian particle velocity distributions ( pvds ) are regularly observed .    in accordance to recent analytical estimations ( voitenko & de keyser 2011 ; borovsky & gary 2011 ; rudakov et al . 2011",

    "( 2015 ) demonstrating clear observational evidences of the quasilinear plateaus rendering @xmath204 inappropriate . the real damping and its influence on the observed spectra",
    "are therefore reduced by the particles feedback ( see equation ( 25 ) by voitenko & de keyser 2011 , and following discussions ) .    to obtain the average spectral index observed in the solar wind ( @xmath205  at @xmath206 ) from the regular nondissipative spectral index ( @xmath207 ) ,  one needs to add the index decrement of about @xmath208 . in accordance to recent findings",
    ", this decrement can be provided by damping ( howes et al .",
    "2011 ) and/or intermittency ( boldyrev et al . 2012 ) . as the sheet - like intermittency regularly appears in simulations (",
    "boldyrev et al . 2012 ) and reduces the spectral index to @xmath209 , the rest @xmath210  can be attributed to damping .",
    "the influence of damping on the turbulent spectra is therefore small , in which case the two - fluid model is a good proxy to study kaw turbulent spectra ( see e.g. boldyrev et al .",
    "2012 ; vsconez et al .",
    "several damping mechanisms can contribute to the @xmath210  decrement , including landau damping , ion - cyclotron damping , non - adiabatic / stochastic heating , etc .",
    "( see e.g. quataert 1998 ; voitenko & goossens 2004 ; chandran et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the two - fluid simulations by boldyrev & perez ( 2012 ) giving the spectral index @xmath211 , similar to the observed indices and to the index @xmath205 found in gyrokinetic simulations ( howes et al .",
    "2011b ; tenbarge & howes 2013 ) .",
    "this suggests that the dissipative effects are not so important for the turbulent spectra in the solar wind .",
    "when the high - frequency @xmath27 kaws are excited by the turbulent cascade , they can undergo the ion - cyclotron resonance with particles satisfying the resonant condition @xmath212 ( hollweg & isenberg 2002 ; voitenko & goossens 2002 , 2003 )",
    ". however , this process depends not solely on the wave frequency , but also on the wave polarization and plasma properties . in particular , both the right - hand polarization of kaws and the quasilinear modification of the proton velocity distribution reduce the wave damping at the ion - cyclotron resonance",
    "the right - hand polarization allows also a smooth extension of the kaw branch above the ion - cyclotron frequency ( boldyrev et al .",
    "2013)*. * in addition , the ion - cyclotron resonance is narrow - band ( see e.g. fig . 4 by vsconez et al .",
    "2014 ) , and the turbulent cascade can jump over the narrow resonant layer and proceed further to higher frequencies . these properties of kaws explain their observations above the ion - cyclotron frequency ( huang et al .",
    "2012 ) .      to model the alfvnic turbulence we also used a quasilinear premise ( e.g. , schekochihin et al .",

    "it is a rather natural consequence of the constant energy flux and critical balance conditions and may change only if one or both of the above conditions are violated .",
