    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) have for some time been known to exhibit exceptional rotational stability , with decade long observations providing timing measurements with accuracies similar to atomic clocks ( e.g. ) .",
    "such stability lends itself well to the pursuit of a wide range of scientific goals , e.g. observations of the pulsar psr b1913 + 16 showed a loss of energy at a rate consistent with that predicted for gravitational waves @xcite , whilst the double pulsar system psr j0737 - 3039a / b has provided precise measurements of several ` post keplerian ' parameters allowing for additional stringent tests of general relativity @xcite .    for a detailed review of pulsar timing",
    "refer to e.g. @xcite . in brief , the arrival times of pulses ( toas ) for a particular pulsar will be recorded by an observatory in a series of discrete observations over a period of time .",
    "these arrival times must all be transformed into a common frame of reference , the solar system barycenter , in order to correct for the motion of the earth .    a model for the pulsar",
    "can then be fitted to the toas ; this characterises the properties of the pulsar s orbital motion , as well as its timing properties such as its orbital frequency and spin down .",
    "this is most commonly carried out using the tempo2 pulsar - timing packages @xcite , or more recently , the bayesian pulsar timing package temponest @xcite .    when performing this fitting process , both tempo2 and temponest assume purely gaussian statistics in the properties of the uncorrelated noise . in realistic datasets , however , this assumption is not necessarily correct .",
    "if the underlying probability density function ( pdf ) for the noise is not gaussian , for example , if there is an excess of outliers relative to a gaussian distribution , modifiers to the toa error bars that scale their size are used to find the best approximation to a gaussian distribution .",
    "this can be performed using a single modifier for a given receiving system determined across an entire dataset , or as in the ` fixdata ' plugin for tempo2 @xcite , where the modifier is determined separately for a series of short time lags .",
    "while the latter of these two approaches can better account for a non - gaussian distribution in the uncorrelated noise , it does so at the expense of a potentially large number of additional free parameters , and ultimately does not address the core issue , that the underlying distribution is not gaussian .",
    "both approaches then have the direct consequence of decreasing the precision with which one can estimate the timing parameters , and any other signals of interest , such as intrinsic red spin noise due to rotational irregularities in the neutron star @xcite or correlated noise due to a stochastic gravitational wave background ( gwb ) generated by , for example , coalescing black holes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , currently all published limits on the signals induced by a gwb have been obtained under the assumption that the statistics of the toa errors are gaussian ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a method of performing a robust bayesian analysis of non - gaussianity present in pulsar timing data , simultaneously with the pulsar timing model , and additional stochastic parameters such as those describing the red noise , and dispersion measure variations .",
    "the parameters used to define the presence of non - gaussianity are zero for gaussian processes , giving a simple method of defining the strength of non - gaussian behaviour . in section [ section : bayes ]",
    "we will describe the basic principles of our bayesian approach to data analysis , giving a brief overview of how it may be used to perform model selection , and introduce multinest . in sections [ section :",
    "nongausslike ] and [ section : toy ] we introduce the non - gaussian likelihood we will use in our pulsar timing analysis , and apply it to a simple toy problem . in section [ section : pulsarnongaussian ] we then extend this likelihood to the subject of pulsar timing , and apply it to both simulated and real data in sections [ section : pulsarsims ] and [ section : realdata ] respectively , before finally offering some concluding remarks in section [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "this research is the result of the common effort to directly detect gravitational waves using pulsar timing , known as the european pulsar timing array ( epta ) @xcite .",
    "given a set of data @xmath1 , bayesian inference provides a consistent approach to the estimation of a set of parameters @xmath2 in a model or hypothesis @xmath3 . in particular ,",
    "bayes theorem states that :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the posterior probability distribution of the parameters , @xmath6 is the likelihood , @xmath7 is the prior probability distribution , and @xmath8 is the bayesian evidence .",
    "since the evidence is independent of the parameters @xmath2 it is typically ignored when one is only interested in performing parameter estimation . in this case inferences",
    "are obtained by taking samples from the ( unnormalised ) posterior using , for example , standard markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampling methods .    for model selection ,",
    "however , the evidence is key , and is defined simply as the factor required to normalise the posterior over @xmath2 :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the dimensionality of the parameter space .    as the evidence is just the average of the likelihood over the prior",
    ", it will be larger for a simpler model with a compact parameter space if more of that parameter space is likely .",
    "more complex models where large areas of parameter space have low likelihood values will have a smaller evidence even if the likelihood function is very highly peaked , unless they are significantly better at explaining the data .",
    "thus , the evidence automatically implements occam s razor .",
    "the question of model selection between two models @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be answered via the model selection ratio @xmath13 , commonly referred to as the ` bayes factor ' :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the a priori probability ratio for the two models , which in this work we will set to unity but occasionally requires further consideration .",
    "the bayes factor then allows us to obtain the probability of one model compared the other simply as :    @xmath16    in practice when performing bayesian analysis we do not work with the likelihood , but the log likelihood . in this case",
    "the quantity of interest is the log bayes factor , which is simply the difference in the log evidence for the two models .",
    "for example , a difference in the log evidence of 3 for two competing models gives a bayes factor of @xmath17 , which in turn gives a probability of @xmath18 .",
    "we use the difference in the log evidence in sections [ section : pulsarsims ] and [ section : realdata ] to perform model selection between our gaussian and non - gaussian models .",
    "while many techniques exist for calculating the evidence , such as thermodynamic integration @xcite , it remains a challenging task both numerically and computationally , with evidence evaluation at least an order - of - magnitude more costly than parameter estimation .",
    "nested sampling @xcite is an approach designed to make the calculation of the evidence more efficient , and also produces posterior inferences as a by - product .",
    "the multinest algorithm ( @xcite ) builds upon this nested sampling framework , and provides an efficient means of sampling from posteriors that may contain multiple modes and/or large ( curving ) degeneracies , and also calculates the evidence .",
    "since its release multinest has been used successfully in a wide range of astrophysical problems , including inferring the properties of a potential stochastic gravitational wave background in pulsar timing array data @xcite , and is also used in the bayesian pulsar timing package temponest .",
    "this technique has greatly reduced the computational cost of bayesian parameter estimation and model selection , and is employed in this paper .",
    "in this section we will outline the method adopted for including non - gaussian behaviour in our analysis .",
    "we use the approach developed in @xcite , which is based on the energy eigenmode wavefunctions of a simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "we will describe this in brief below in order to aid future discussion .",
    "we begin by considering our data , the vector @xmath19 of length @xmath20 , as the sum of some signal @xmath21 and noise @xmath22 such that : @xmath23 we can then construct the likelihood that the residuals after subtracting our model signal from the data follows an uncorrelated gaussian distribution of width @xmath24 as :    @xmath25,\\ ] ]    with @xmath26 the diagonal noise covariance matrix for the residuals , such that @xmath27 , and @xmath28 the determinant of @xmath26 .",
    "we now extend this to the general case in order to allow for non - gaussian distributions by modelling our pdf as the sum of a set of gaussians , modified by hermite polynomials @xmath29 ( see e.g. @xcite for previous uses of hermite polynomials in describing departures from gaussianity ) , defined as : @xmath30    therefore , for a general random variable @xmath31 the pdf for fluctuations in @xmath31 can be written : @xmath32\\left|\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\alpha_nc_nh_n\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma}\\right)\\right|^2\\ ] ] with @xmath33 free parameters that describe the relative contributions of each term to the sum , and @xmath34 is a normalization factor",
    ". equation [ eq : prx ] forms a complete set of pdfs , normalised such that :    @xmath35c_nh_n\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma}\\right)c_mh_m\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma}\\right ) = \\delta_{mn},\\ ] ]    with @xmath36 the kronecker delta , where the ground state , @xmath11 , reproduces a standard gaussian pdf , and any non - gaussianity in the distribution of @xmath31 will be reflected in non - zero values for the coefficients @xmath33 associated with higher order states .",
    "the only constraint we must place on the values of the amplitudes @xmath37 is : @xmath38 with @xmath39 the maximum number of coefficients to be included in the model for the pdf .",
    "this is performed most simply by setting : @xmath40    we can therefore rewrite eq . [",
    "eq : gausslike ] in this more general form as : @xmath41\\nonumber \\\\ & \\times&\\prod_{i=1}^{n_d}\\left|\\sum_{n=0}^{n_{\\mathrm{max}}}\\alpha_nc_nh_n\\left(\\frac{d_i - s_i}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma}\\right)\\right|^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the advantage of this method is that one may use a finite set of non - zero @xmath33 to model the non - gaussianity , without mathematical inconsistency .",
    "any truncation of the series still yields a proper distribution , in contrast to the more commonly used edgeworth expansion ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "before applying the formalism described in section [ section : nongausslike ] to the practice of pulsar timing , we first demonstrate its use in a toy problem .",
    "here our data vector @xmath19 contains 10000 points drawn from a non - gaussian distribution obtained using eq .",
    "[ eq : prx ] , with parameters listed in table [ table : toyparams ] .",
    ".parameters used to generate non - gaussian noise in a simple toy problem . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : logevidence ]    table [ table : logevidence ] lists the log evidence values for different sets of non - gaussian coefficients , normalised such that the log evidence for no additional coefficients ( i.e. assuming gaussian statistics ) is 0 .",
    "we see that there is a significant increase in the log evidence ( @xmath42 39 ) when including even just two coefficients , indicating definitive support for their inclusion in the model . as the number increases the rise in evidence increases , reaching a maximum with 4 included coefficients .",
    "given the timing model , red noise and dispersion measure variation solutions that were subtracted from the data were obtained from a gaussian analysis , we will however still include coefficients up to and including @xmath43 in the full analysis .",
    "given the large dimensionality of the problem this analysis can not be carried out using multinest . as such we make use of the guided hamiltonian sampler used previously in pulsar timing analysis in @xcite .",
    "this sampler makes use of both gradient information in the likelihood , and also the hessian in order to efficiently sample from large parameter spaces .",
    "table [ table:0437 ] lists the timing model parameter estimates and their nominal standard deviations for both the gaussian and non - gaussian analysis . in all cases",
    "we find the parameter estimates and their uncertainties to be consistent between both methods . in fig .",
    "[ figure:0437noise ] ( top ) we show the one and two - dimensional marginalised posterior distributions for the red noise and dispersion measure variation power law amplitudes and spectral indicies for the non - gaussian ( left ) and gaussian ( right ) analysis .",
    "both are also extremely consistent with one another , however when overlaying the two sets of 1-dimensional posterior distributions for each of the 4 parameters separately ( bottom 4 panels ) some differences become apparent between the non - gaussian ( blue dashed lines ) and gaussian ( red solid lines ) analysis . in particular",
    "the dispersion measure variation power law parameter estimates show a slight shift towards higher amplitudes and shallower spectral indices in the non - gaussian case .    despite these similarities in the timing and stochastic parameter estimates between the gaussian and non - gaussian analysis , fig .",
    "[ figure:0437pdf ] indicates a definitive detection of non - gaussianity in the dataset , in agreement with the difference in the log evidence for the noise only analysis . in the top plot",

    "vertical lines are included at 0 where visible in the plots , however , except for @xmath44 all the coefficients are inconsistent with this value . in the bottom plot",
    "we then show the set of equally weighted pdfs obtained from the non - gaussian analysis ( black lines ) setting @xmath45 .",
    "in addition we over plot the mean of the distribution ( red line ) and a unit gaussian ( blue line ) all of which have been normalised to have a sum of 1 .",
    "the difference between the gaussian and non - gaussian pdfs is clear , with a larger probability for both small ( @xmath46 ) and larger ( @xmath47 ) deviations than given by the gaussian pdf . that such a significant detection of non - gaussianity does not lead to larger changes in the parameter estimates",
    "can potentially be attributed to a frequency dependence on the significance of the @xmath48 parameters . in @xcite",
    "the 10 cm j0437@xmath04715 data was found to be describable through gaussian statistics alone .",
    "this would suggest that the non - gaussianity we detect exists primarily at low frequencies . in figure",

    "the increase in non - gaussian behaviour can clearly be seen as the wavelength increases .",
    "given the lowest frequencies have the greatest degree of non - gaussianity it is less surprising that there is little impact on the timing or red spin noise parameters , as the low frequency data contributes the least to these parts of the model .",
    "the low frequencies do , however , contribute greatly to the constraints on dispersion measure variations , and it is here we see the greatest difference between the gaussian and non - gaussian models .",
