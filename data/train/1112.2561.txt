    "one first solves an eigenvalue equation for the electrons in the field of nuclei clamped at some predetermined points in space and thus builds the potential - energy surface ( pes ) .",
    "then one solves an equation for the nuclei moving on that pes and obtains the allowed energies of the molecule . in many cases the calculation is restricted to the neighborhood of the minimum of the pes in order to determine the molecular geometry@xcite .",
    "accurate pes s are useful for chemical - kinetic studies@xcite .",
    "there has recently been great interest on the calculation of molecular properties by means of nonadiabatic approaches ; i.e. without resorting to the bo approximation . since the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian operator of the molecule @xmath0 are not square integrable with respect to the @xmath1 coordinates that describe the @xmath2 particles ( electrons plus nuclei ) in the laboratory - fixed coordinate axes one has to remove the unbounded motion of the molecular center of mass and the three corresponding coordinates .",
    "thus one is left with the schrdinger equation for the resulting molecular hamiltonian operator in the molecule - fixed coordinate axes @xmath3 that depends on @xmath4 coordinates and momenta . for brevity , from now on",
    "we call those coordinates absolute and relative ( or internal ) , respectively . by means of the variational method one",
    "obtains an approximate eigenfunction of @xmath3 that should be also eigenfunction of the operators that commute with @xmath3 , such as , for example , spin , angular momentum operator in relative coordinates , etc@xcite .",
    "there are several strategies for solving the schrdinger equation without the bo approximation .",
    "one of them is based on explicitly correlated gaussian functions of the relative coordinates of all the electrons and nuclei in the molecule ( for a comprehensive review see bubin et al@xcite ) .",
    "the trial function constructed from those gaussians satisfies the permutational symmetry of identical particles and contains several parameters that are to be determined according to the variational method . if the gaussians are located at one nuclei it is not difficult to choose the variational wavefunction to be eigenfunction of the angular - momentum operator . in some cases it is convenient to place the centers of the gaussians on different space points and it is more difficult to force the variational function to be eigenfunction of the angular - momentum operator . in these calculations",
    "the authors explicitly expressed the variational function and the hamiltonian operator in relative coordinates@xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "another widely spread strategy is based on uncorrelated functions and the scf approach . in this case the variational function is written as a product of one - particle functions with the appropriate permutational symmetry .",
    "since there are nuclear orbitals in addition to electronic ones this approach has been termed nuclear orbital plus molecular orbital ( nomo ) theory@xcite and also ( but no longer in use now ) dynamic extended molecular orbital ( demo ) method@xcite . since",
    "such orbitals are expressed in terms of the @xmath1 absolute cartesian coordinates one has to be careful to avoid the spurious contribution of the kinetic energy of the center of mass@xcite . in order to avoid this problem nakai et al@xcite proposed to subtract the kinetic energy of the molecular center of mass from the hamiltonian operator during the variational optimization of the trial wavefunction and developed the translation - free nomo ( tf - nomo ) .",
    "although the nomo approach is a nonadiabatic method its implementation is reminiscent of the bo approximation in that the orbitals are located at the `` experimental geometries''@xcite .",
    "note that such a concept is rather alien to the nonadiabatic quantum - mechanical calculation just outlined ( compare it with the more rigorous approach described by bubin et al@xcite ) .",
    "the properly symmetrized product of orbitals located at different points and expressed in terms of absolute coordinates is not an eigenfunction of the angular - momentum operator@xcite .",
    "for that reason several rotational states are expected to contribute to the optimized variational function .    in order to remove the contribution of rotational states with angular - momentum quantum number @xmath5 nakai et al@xcite proposed a rotation - free nomo that consists of subtracting also the rotational kinetic energy from the total hamiltonian operator .",
    "the resulting approach is named translation- and rotation - free nomo  ( trf - nomo ) .",
    "however , the removal of the spurious rotational kinetic energy in this way is not exact as in the case of the translation kinetic energy as argued by sutcliffe@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is the analysis of the performance of the tf - nomo and the effect of using absolute cartesian coordinates in the trial wavefunction .",

    "in this section we outline some general properties of the nonrelativistic hamiltonian operator for a system of @xmath2 charged point particles with only coulomb interactions .",
    "the results are well known and have been discussed by several authors in different contexts ( see , for example , the review by fernndez and echave@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the nonrelativistic hamiltonian operator for a molecule can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass of particle @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 are the charges of either an electron or nucleus , respectively , and @xmath11 is the distance between particles @xmath8 and @xmath12 located at the points @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , from the origin of the laboratory - fixed coordinate system . in the coordinate representation @xmath15 .    since the the uniform translation of all the particles @xmath16 leaves the coulomb potential invariant @xmath17 , then the eigenfunctions of the translation  invariant hamiltonian operator ( [ eq : h = t+v_full ] ) are not square integrable . for that reason we separate the motion of the center of mass and define translation - invariant internal coordinates by means of a linear transformation @xmath18",
    "it is our purpose to keep the transformation ( [ eq : r->r ] ) as general as possible so that it applies to a wide variety of nonadiabatic approaches .",

    "the explicit form of the interparticle distances @xmath27 in terms of the new coordinates @xmath28 may be rather cumbersome in the general case but there are particular choices that are suitable for the calculation of the integrals necessary for the application of the variational method@xcite .",

    "we also appreciate that @xmath40    the eigenfunctions of the total hamiltonian operator ( [ eq : h = t+v_full ] ) are of the form @xmath41 with the appropriate permutational symmetry for the electrons and nuclei .",
    "we are of course interested in the wavefunction for the internal degrees of freedom @xmath42 that provides the relevant molecular properties .",
    "for this reason we should use a trial function of the corresponding coordinates @xmath43 and apply the variational method with the relative or molecular hamiltonian operator @xmath26@xcite .",
    "nakai et al@xcite proposed an alternative route based on a trial function of the absolute cartesian coordinates @xmath44 and applied the variational method to @xmath45 more precisely , they resorted to the hartree - fock method with electronic and nuclear orbitals . in this equation one",

    "this approach is called tf - nomo method and is an improvement over the translation - contaminated nomo tc - nomo method ( like , for example , the demo@xcite ) that is based on the variational method for @xmath0 .",

    "it is surprising that the variational function with the optimal value @xmath90 of the adjustable parameter yields the exact energy @xmath91 .",
    "however , it is not the only striking fact because the expectation values of any function of @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( like , for example , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , etc ) are exact too . in spite of this remarkable agreement",
    "the exact and approximate wavefunctions are not the same as follows from the fact that @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we will explain these curious results later on ; for the time being note that the results of nakai et al@xcite for @xmath99 yield the spurious contribution of the kinetic energy of the center of mass to the molecular energy .",
    "they state that this problem is due to the fact that the gaussian functions are unsuitable for describing the translational energy but it is clear that a set of gaussian functions in relative coordinates will not exhibit such undesirable behavior . in other words , the translational contamination is a consequence of adopting the absolute coordinates and not a result of the choice of gaussian functions .",

    "[ fig : energy ] shows the exact and approximate dimensionless ground - state energy calculated in the two ways just outlined .",
    "as expected , tf - nomo yields considerably more accurate results because tc - nomo is strongly contaminated with the kinetic energy of the center of mass .",
    "this point was discussed earlier by fernndez@xcite with respect to the demo method@xcite .",
    "note that tf - nomo is remarkably accurate for all @xmath114 and yields the exact result for @xmath115 as discussed above .",
    "we may try and improve the tc - nomo results by simply subtracting the kinetic energy of the center of mass , thus producing a sort of corrected tc - nomo or ctc - nomo : @xmath116 figure  [ fig : energy ] shows that the energy calculated in this way agrees quite well with the exact and tf - nomo ones .",
    "this result shows that most of the error in the energy calculated by means of the tc - nomo comes from the spurious kinetic energy and just a relatively small contribution comes from the inadequate optimization of the variational wavefunction with respect to @xmath117 .",

    "in fact , we expect to obtain the exact expectation values of any observable in relative coordinates .",
    "we do not obtain the exact expectation value of @xmath70 because this operator contains a derivative with respect to the redundant absolute variable that does not appear in the exact square - integrable wavefunction .    in order to compare the approximate and exact wavefunctions we write both @xmath124 and @xmath125 as @xmath126 \\exp \\left [ -\\alpha \\left ( q_{2}^{2}+q_{3}^{2}\\right )",

    "the agreement between the exact and tf - nomo exponential parameters @xmath130 and @xmath131 explains why the approximate wavefunction yields so accurate expectation values of operators in the relative coordinates @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "although rather oversimplified , this model enables us to take into account the main ingredients of the nomo - scf method .",
    "we have a translation - invariant potential - energy function and , consequently , we have to remove the unbounded motion of the center of mass . in this case a correlated gaussian function of the relative coordinates yields the exact result that is most convenient to test the approximate ones .",

    "the integration of the square this uncorrelated function with respect to the redundant absolute coordinate ( three in a realistic case as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_gen ] ) ) gives rise to some kind of particle correlation .",
    "if the adjustable parameters in this trial function are optimized variationally with the hamiltonian @xmath136 then the correlation just mentioned appears to improve the calculation of the energy and expectation values considerably .",
    "perhaps , one should not expect such a remarkable success for an actual molecule , but , however , there is no doubt that even in that case the nomo - scf will take into account part of the correlation energy in spite of being based on uncorrelated gaussian functions . in order to verify this conjecture that is expressed in eq .",

    "the simple model also shows that if we simply subtract the expectation value of the kinetic energy of the center of mass then the resulting energy is quite accurate ( what we have called ctc - nomo ) .",
