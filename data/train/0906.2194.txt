    "graphene is probably one of the most remarkable discoveries in condensed matter physics in the last decade @xcite .",
    "the material is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystal composed of carbon ( c ) atoms with sp@xmath0 hybridization , that is , graphene is one atom thick and thus the thinnest cloth in nature . because of its low dimensionality , it does not show structural long - range order in its free form , as per the hohenberg - mermin - wagner ( hmw ) theorem@xcite , but it can present a flat phase at low temperatures due to non - linear effects or in the presence of a substrate , scaffolds , contacts , or impurities that break explicitly the translational symmetry perpendicular to the graphene plane@xcite .",
    "the leftovers of the fluctuations that forbid long - range order are found in the form of frozen ripples in suspended @xcite samples .",
    "while it was theoretically predicted early on that graphene by itself would not be magnetic@xcite , it has been shown that adatoms in the graphene surface can easily form magnetic moments due to graphene s unusual electronic properties such as low density of states and chirality@xcite . moreover , because graphene has a low density of states close to the dirac point , the kondo effect is suppressed@xcite , allowing for the appearance of magnetic states . on the other hand , because of its low dimensionality , long - range magnetic order is inhibited , and the intrinsic coupling between structural and magnetic fluctuations may lead to very inhomogeneous spin textures ( such as of griffiths phases  @xcite ) that can be found in complex itinerant magnetic systems such as disordered kondo lattices@xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "performing a series of monte carlo simulations over disordered realizations of magnetic adatoms in a graphene sheet , we examine the magnetic correlations of the local moments in the magnetization and in the magnetoresistance curves . in the case of adatoms such as hydrogen ( h ) , where the probability of adsorption changes substantially according to the local curvature of the graphene sheet , we show that the formation of local magnetic moments leads to an interesting interplay between the correlation due to the rkky interaction and the ripples , generating a variety of magnetic textures , tendency to clustering at low concentrations and a percolative transition at higher concentration of adatoms .",
    "since the overall magnetic response of a single layer is rather small compared to the usual response in bulk , magnetotransport measurements are probably the easiest way to probe magnetic correlations in graphene . based in our monte carlo results for the magnetization",
    ", we calculate the magnetoresistance curves in graphene for strong disorder .",
    "these curves can offer clear experimental signatures for the presence of macroscopic magnetic states in graphene in the regime of variable range hopping  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the spin hamiltonian for the magnetic adatoms ; in sec .",
    "iii we derive the heuristic rules for adsorption of adatoms in graphene , comparing different realizations of disorder for different adsorption probability distributions , which we define in terms of the curvature ( height ) of the ripples . in sec .",
    "iv , we derive the magnetization curves and in sec .",
    "v we calculate the magnetoresistance . finally , in sec .",
    "vi we present our conclusions .",
    "our starting point is the tight - binding hamiltonian of the electrons in graphene ( we set @xmath1)@xcite : @xmath2,\\label{htb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) annihilates and electron with spin @xmath5 on sublattice @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) at position @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ev ) is the nearest neighbor hopping energy .",
    "when adatoms are added to graphene they can hybridize with an energy @xmath11 to the c atoms and if the local coulomb energy @xmath12 is sufficiently large , a local moment of spin @xmath13 is formed@xcite at a site @xmath14 .",
    "this spin @xmath15 interacts with the graphene electrons via an exchange interaction , @xmath16 , which is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the graphene electron spin .",
    "( [ htb ] ) together with ( [ kondo ] ) describe a kondo lattice in graphene .",
    "the kondo interaction ( [ kondo ] ) induces an indirect kinetic exchange interaction between local moments , the rkky interaction , which depends on the chemical potential @xmath19 and hence can be controlled with an external gate voltage .",
    "therefore , the nature of the magnetic states in graphene can be controlled by the application of a transverse _ electric _ field , a situation that never occurs in metals . for low carrier concentrations , i.e. close to the dirac point ,",
    "the interaction between spins located in the same sublattice is ferromagnetic , @xmath20 , while it is antiferromagnetic if they belong to opposite sublattices ( @xmath21)@xcite . given the position of the magnetic moments and the effective interaction between them , we can perform numerical simulations to obtain the magnetic properties of the system .",
    "when an adatom sits on top of a carbon atom , the carbon sp@xmath0bonds are locally distorted and acquire a sp@xmath22 character as in diamond , with the carbon underneath the impurity being pulled out of the plane@xcite .",
    "although a flat graphene sheet has almost no magnetic anisotropy due to the very small spin - orbit coupling@xcite , in the presence of ripples@xcite , lattice distortions of the sp@xmath22 type that are generated by the presence of adatoms such as h can substantially increase the spin - orbit interaction close to the adatoms , generating a local spin - orbit coupling up to @xmath23 mev@xcite , which corresponds to an out of plane magnetic anisotropy of @xmath24 t. in the range of temperature @xmath25 , the minimal model for the interaction between adatoms in graphene should be correctly captured by the physics of the ising model : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a spatially dependent rkky interaction that depends on @xmath19 and @xmath28 is an external magnetic field . for @xmath29 , the period of the rkky oscillation",
    "is long compared to the typical atomic distances and we only need to consider the power - law decay of the interaction .",
    "the exchange is given by @xmath30 for spins in the same sublattice and @xmath31 for spins in different sublattices .",
    "@xmath32 is given in units of the lattice constant @xmath33   and @xmath34   is a cut - off distance that is introduced to limit the range of the parameters in the numerical calculations .",
    "in a flat graphene layer , the magnetic interaction between impurity spins would generate uniform magnetic states .",
    "nevertheless , ripples in the graphene structure break the translational symmetry and lead to a inhomogeneous situation where the adatoms have preferential sites for hybridization . due to ripples ,",
    "the topography of the surface in graphene is not flat but _ _ has _ _ _ curvature , _ _ _ which appears in _ _ in the form of `` valleys '' and `` hills '' . in graphene ,",
    "the typical ratio between the height ( @xmath35 ) and the lateral size ( @xmath36 ) of the ripples is @xmath37 @xcite . on top of a hill",
    ", the characteristic curvature of the ripples distorts the sp@xmath0 bonds to an extent that they acquire sp@xmath22 character , with a significant hybridization between the @xmath38 and @xmath39 bands .",
    "in this situation , the adsorption of a h atom on a hill - c has been shown to be energetically favorable , helping to stabilize the ripple@xcite . on the other hand , for perfectly flat graphene , the adsorption of a h atom costs some energy to locally distort the sp@xmath0 bonds and pull the hydrogenated c atom out of the plane .",
    "the difference in the chemisorption energy between the two cases , recently calculated by _ ab initio _ methods , can be as large as 2.5 ev .",
    "these results also indicate the existence of a minimal curvature for the ripples ( @xmath40 ) above which the adsorption of a h atom can be strongly favorable@xcite .",
    "the substantial change in the chemisorption energy of h with the local curvature in graphene is qualitatively consistent with previous theoretical  @xcite and experimental @xcite results in nanotubes , where the binding energy has been shown to change dramatically with the radius of the tube .",
    "assuming that graphene is supported on a substrate , only one surface is available for hybridization .",
    "notice that because of curvature , the @xmath41 orbitals that are locally perpendicular to the graphene surface , approach each other in the valleys but distance themselves in the hills .",
    "contrary to the hill - c case , the local curvature is expected to inhibit the h adsorption in the valleys , since in order to stabilize the c - h bond relative to the other three c sp@xmath22-like bonds , the h has to pull the c atom out of the plane against the curvature , at the expense of an additional cost of energy , compared to the flat case ( the difference in chemisorption energies between the hill - c and the valley - c cases could easily amount to several ev ) .",
    "the h adatoms therefore hybridize much more easily in the hills than in the valleys , leading to a `` percolative '' structure as the planar density of adatoms is increased .",
    "therefore , the probability that an adatom hybridizes with a hill - c is larger than a valley - c atom .",
    "let us assume , for the sake of the argument , that the ripples in graphene have a simple sinusoidal form ( see ref . ) , that is , if @xmath42 is the perpendicular coordinate of the c atom relative to the flat situation , then @xmath43 where @xmath6 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are random parameters .",
    "a large number ( up to 200 ) of such sinusoidal waves can be superimposed to obtain a randomly curved sheet , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) for a system with @xmath47 c atoms .",
    "next , we decide a strategy to allow the incorporation of adatoms by the graphene sheet for some quenched realization of ripples",
    "( b ) -(c ) graphene sheet covered with adatoms for a lower cut - off @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively ( see main text ) .",
    "( d ) zoom - in showing the adatoms on top of a hill ( red rectangle).[fig1 ] ]    given the existence of a lower bounded range of local curvature where the adsorption is most likely to happen@xcite , and also the fact that the adsorption is much easier on the top of a hill rather than in the bottom of a valley in graphene , we assume a probability distribution that grows monotonically with the height of the ripples and has some effective lower cut - off , @xmath50 , below which the adsorption is unlikely to happen . as a toy model , we may assume for instance that the probability of adsorption varies linearly with @xmath42 through the following criterion : we allow the incorporation if @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a random number varying from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , and @xmath55 $ ] is the lower cut - off of the distribution , with @xmath56 as the maximum height .",
    "the choice of another distribution function such as , for instance , a step function , @xmath57 , or some other distribution with a finite tail for @xmath58 , should lead to similar conclusions regarding the physical properties , as far as the probability of adsorption on the top of the hills is large compared to the probability adsorption in the valleys .",
    "if the number of atoms which are available for adsorption is fixed , by varying @xmath50 we obtain different incorporation fractions , as shown in figures  [ fig1 ] ( b),(c ) .",
    "notice that for a given realization of ripples , as one increases the adatom concentration , one obtains a percolative structure . at low coverage densities the adatoms form _ clusters_. hence",
    ", ripples naturally lead to clustering .",
    "we can also fix the total number of adatoms attached to the sample and see how the different probability functions change the coverage structure of the system . in this case , the overall structure is the same of figures  [ fig1 ] ( b),(c ) but different probability distributions lead to different concentration of adatoms on top of the hills , as it will be clear in the next section .",
    "the details of the clustering depend on the nature of the adatoms used .",
    "for instance , if one uses h atoms , one might imagine that only h atoms that are separated by more than one lattice spacing are stable since h atoms which are in neighboring c sites can recombine into h@xmath59 molecules and leave the graphene surface  @xcite .",
    "hence , we have considered two different situations , namely , either the adatoms have nearest neighbors or not .",
    "we studied the location of magnetic adatoms using the same incorporation rules discussed above , with and without allowing the existence of nearest neighbors . for the system without first neighbors ,",
    "we randomly remove the neighbors , in order to avoid any artificial distribution of spins .",
    "we found that the magnetic response of these two systems are rather different and can be distinguished experimentally .",

    "[ fig3 ] ]    for a graphene sheet with full coverage , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) , we find that the moments order antiferromagnetically , as expected .",
    "nevertheless , when we associate the local probability of adsorption of the adatoms to the ripples and we start to dilute the coverage for increasing values of @xmath50 , the situation is rather more complicated .",
    "what we observe in figure [ fig2 ] ( b)-(d ) is the destruction of the antiferromagnetic order on the clusters that are located on top of the ripples .",
    "the system becomes highly _ frustrated _ and finally for very low coverage we find that the system consists basically of weakly interacting isolated moments and clusters of few spins .",
    "one notices that the destruction of antiferromagnetic order is accompanied by a ferromagnetic tendency , that is , the clusters tend to _ either remain antiferromagnetically ordered and interact ferromagnetically with nearest clusters _ ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( c ) ) or order ferromagnetically in a situation that is reminiscent either of _ super - paramagnetism _ or a _ spin glass _ state @xcite . ",
    "\" in this paper we have considered only the average magnetic properties while disregarding rare events that can lead to griffiths phases [ griffiths ] .",
    "however , rare event physics can play an important role in these disordered magnetic systems and may contribute to the magnetic response .",
    "this is a problem , however , beyond the scope of the current manuscript .    for the configurations discussed above , we calculate the total average magnetization @xmath62 and the average staggered magnetization , @xmath63 , in terms of the magnetization of each sublattice , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , as a function of the magnetic field @xmath28 .",
    "all the numerical simulations were performed for an ising hamiltonian with 2 @xmath66 600 @xmath66 600 sites .",
    "we used 10000 monte carlo steps for warm up and another 10000 steps to collect the data . the magnetization is computed as an average over 160 to 400 realizations . as can be seen in fig . [ fig3](a ) and ( b ) the maximally covered honeycomb lattice has always an antiferromagnetic correlation between the spins but as the coverage is reduced , this correlation is strongly suppressed , changing the shape of the hysteresis loops .",

    "[ fig5 ] ]    if we suppress the existence of nearest neighbors , one favors ferromagnetic interactions , once the interaction between next - nearest neighbors is ferromagnetic .",
    "however , as the magnetic atoms are randomly removed , we never produce a regular lattice of spins and do not have a perfect ferromagnetic system . instead ,",
    "for the system that was originally a regular honeycomb lattice , we see in figure [ fig4 ] ( a ) the formation of _ magnetic domains _ in the form of antiferromagnetically correlated _",
    "ferromagnetic stripes_. in the dilute situation [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4](b)-(d ) ] these ferromagnetic stripes are broken apart leaving behind ferromagnetic strings .",
    "the situation is clearly quite complex from the magnetic point of view and it is important to distinguish these various spin textures experimentally .        in the case of an originally regular honeycomb lattice without neighboring adatoms , the magnetization @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows a large coercivity due to the ferromagnetic stripes ( black circles ) , which decreases with smaller incorporation fractions .",
    "whereas for large incorporation fractions we still can see the signature of antiferromagnetic correlations in the shape of the hysteresis curve , for smaller incorporation fractions the systems consists of ferromagnetic clusters with a typical ferromagnetic hysteresis loop ( green triangles and red squares ) . by increasing temperature",
    ", we observe a decrease in the coercivity of the hysteresis loop . for @xmath75 ( see inset of fig .  [ fig5 ] ) , the spins interact weakly and we obtain a hysteresis loop that resembles a paramagnetic behavior . in this case , for low magnetic fields , @xmath28",
    ", we find a universal linear dependence in the magnetization , @xmath76 .",
    "it is important to point out the differences between the type of magnetic dilution we present here , compared to the usually magnetic diluted lattice , where the spins are randomly located , without any preferential position . in honeycomb lattices ,",
    "randomly diluted spin systems have a site percolation transition at @xmath77  @xcite . for nearest neighbor ferromagnetic interactions , the occurrence of a magnetic transition as a function of the dilution",
    "@xmath78 has been shown to coincide with the percolation transition @xmath79  @xcite .",
    "for the antiferromagnetic case , recent results for the quantum heisenberg hamiltonian with site dilution  @xcite found that the magnetic long range order persists above @xmath79 . in any case , in the randomly diluted system",
    "the moments are always isolated and weakly coupled at very small concentrations ( @xmath80 ) . in this work ,",
    "we have shown that due to the distribution of spins according to the structure of the ripples , we suggest the possible existence of strongly coupled magnetic clusters on top of the highest graphene hills , even at very low concentration of adatoms .",
    "also , due to the ferromagnetic coupling between next nearest neighbors , the moment of a given cluster will be bigger than zero even for a mostly antiferromagnetic one .    in figure",
    "[ fig6 ] , we compare the coverage structure and magnetization curves for three systems with the same adatom concentration , @xmath81 , but different incorporation probability distributions . the total concentration is the same in the three systems but @xmath50 sets regions where the presence of adatoms is forbidden . as a result",
    ", we can see the presence of strongly correlated clusters for @xmath48 , while for a random distribution of adatoms we found almost isolated spins .",
    "in addition , one can see the clear difference between the hysteresis loop in the correlated case ( ripples ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( a ) , ( b ) , compared to the completely random one [ fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( c ) ] . in the correlated case",
    ", we found regions with high concentration of spins and very strong antiferromagnetic correlations between them at low temperatures ( @xmath82 ) , in contrast with the random case , where both hysteresis and the coercitive fields are very small .",
    "the interplay between the corrugated nature of graphene and its magnetic properties , which gives rise to the spin textures discussed above , can be probed by magneto - transport measurements .",
    "it was recently demonstrated that the incorporation of adatoms can dramatically change the transport properties in graphene  @xcite , where the system can go from a metallic behavior to a variable range hopping regime . in the case of magnetic impurities , due to the exchange interaction between the spin of the carriers and the adatom localized moments ,",
    "the transport properties will be further modified by the interaction between spin and charge degrees of freedom . for strongly disordered graphene , which characterizes the regime of variable range hopping ,",
    "the carriers are trapped with a binding energy @xmath83 .",
    "even at @xmath84 , the exchange interaction fully polarizes the localized spins interacting with a given localized carrier and increases its binding energy  @xcite .",

    "the total binding energy in the presence of the exchange interaction is given by @xmath89 and has an associated bohr radius @xmath90 .",
    "it this situation , each spin is fully polarized in a random direction . if we apply an external field @xmath28 , the localized spins in the whole sample begin to align with the field and because of the exchange interaction between them and the band carriers , @xmath28 gives rise to a splitting of the conduction band . as a consequence ,",
