    "quantizing a classical model is a difficult problem in general .",
    "the theory of geometric quantization ( gq )  @xcite provides a general and powerful framework for the quantization of a wide variety of classical systems , but due to its formidable mathematical language it is inaccessible to most physicists .",
    "we show here and in the preceding paper  @xcite that the useful and physically - motivated theory of coherent state representations  @xcite provides a natural language for describing the techniques of gq . in  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that scalar coherent state theory yields three categories of representations for the spectrum generating algebra ( sga ) of an algebraic model : classical realizations , prequantization , and the irreducible representations of quantization .",
    "this paper generalizes the results of @xcite to vector - valued coherent state representations .",
    "while it is often possible to induce representations of a lie algebra from a one - dimensional irrep of some subalgebra ( as in the standard coherent state construction ) , it is generally more economical and effective to induce from a known multi - dimensional irrep of a larger subalgebra .",
    "the amount of work is then minimized by capitalizing on information that is already available , and leads to a useful physical interpretation of some degrees of freedom of a model system as intrinsic .",
    "for example , using the method of induced representations , wigner  @xcite found irreps of the poincar group corresponding to quantizations of particles with intrinsic spin .",
    "such intrinsic degrees of freedom are often regarded as having quantal origins .",
    "it will be seen that they have classical counterparts and that the general theory of induced representations , when developed within the framework of vector coherent state ( vcs ) theory  @xcite , has a natural expression in the language of geometric quantization .",
    "let @xmath1 be an abstract ( possibly projective ) unitary representation of a dynamical group @xmath2 on a hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "as in the scalar theory , @xmath1 need not be specified precisely ; it could be , for example , a regular representation , or a weil representation on a many - particle hilbert space .",
    "corresponding to any normalized state @xmath4 there is a coadjoint orbit @xmath5 of densities defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the isotropy subgroup of @xmath10 at @xmath11 ; the orbit @xmath12 is known to be symplectic and can be regarded as a classical phase space . moreover , a classical representation @xmath13 of an element @xmath14 , the lie algebra of @xmath2 , is given as a function on @xmath10 by @xmath15 ( for details , see  @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath16 be some other subgroup",
    ". it may be convenient to choose @xmath17 such that @xmath18 is also symplectic , but this condition is not necessary .",
    "the phase space @xmath19 may then be viewed as a @xmath20 fibre bundle with typical fibre @xmath21 . when @xmath17 is set equal to @xmath22 , as in scalar coherent state theory , the fibres become trivial . a specification of @xmath17 that contains @xmath22 as a proper subgroup , in vector coherent state theory , corresponds to regarding some degrees of freedom of @xmath2 as intrinsic , i.e. , as gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "we refer to @xmath17 as the _ intrinsic symmetry group_.    viewing the classical phase space as a smaller space with intrinsic degrees of freedom in this way does not change a classical representation in principle",
    ". however , it gives a new perspective and leads to new quantization procedures .",
    "starting with a density @xmath23 , the classical phase space @xmath10 is generated in two steps .",
    "the first step generates the coadjoint orbit @xmath24 of the subgroup @xmath25 as the set of densities @xmath26 .",

    "each category of representation is a natural extension of the scalar theory .",
    "a _ partial quantization _ is a representation in which only the intrinsic degrees of freedom are quantized and the extrinsic degrees of freedom are represented classically .    to be specific ,",

    "now , we no longer require @xmath65 to be a subspace of the hilbert space @xmath3 for the abstract representation @xmath1 of the rmg . instead , an irrep of the rmg is induced in vcs theory by defining an @xmath347d^d_\\infty$]-intertwining operator @xmath434 from a suitably defined dense subspace @xmath435 to @xmath65 , such that @xmath436 vcs wave functions are then defined initially as vector - valued functions over @xmath347 su(2)$ ] with values in @xmath65 given by @xmath437 because of the constraint condition ( [ eq : rotorintop ] ) , these functions satisfy @xmath438 where @xmath439 is the restriction of the representation @xmath1 to @xmath59 .",

    "it is the standard basis of rotor model wave functions used in nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "the map @xmath465 , defined by equation  ( [ eq:7.168 ] ) , shows that @xmath462 is isomorphic to a subspace of @xmath3 . from the theory of induced representations",
    ", it is known that this subspace is irreducible .",
    "thus , the irrep @xmath195 of the subgroup @xmath347d^6_\\infty$ ] uniquely defines an irreducible representation of the rmg and its lie algebra rma and , hence , a quantization of the symmetric top model .",
    "coherent state representation theory has its most general expression in vector coherent state ( vcs ) theory .",
    "this theory is now highly developed as a practical theory of induced representations .",
    "it encompasses virtually all the standard inducing constructions .",
    "in addition , it facilitates the construction of orthonormal bases for irreducible representations and provides practical algorithms for the computation of the matrix coefficients for the irreps of model spectrum generating algebras . by having the flexibility to induce irreps of a group @xmath2 from a multidimensional irrep of a subgroup @xmath25 , vcs theory has a huge practical advantage over its scalar counterpart .",
    "it has been used to construct irreps of representative examples of all the classical lie algebras and has been applied widely to models in nuclear physics ( cf .",
    "references cited in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the relationship of geometric quantization to the theory of induced representations is surely well understood by experts in the two fields .",
    "however , the new insights and simplifications that can be brought to the practical application of both theories by vcs theory is not known .",
    "we hope to have shown in this paper that , by understanding the relationships between the three theories when they are expressed in a common language , it becomes possible to exploit their complementary features to greatest advantage .",
    "already some new perspectives and new approaches to old physical problems are suggested by the unified approach to quantization presented here .",
    "an important advance in modern physics has been the development of abelian and non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "it has long been known that ( often hidden ) intrinsic motions can have a profound effect on the dynamics of a system .",
    "a well - known example of this is the precessional motion of a symmetric top that is spinning in a way that may not be directly observable about its symmetry axis .",
    "the vcs methods outlined in this paper suggest ways to select physically and mathematically relevant intrinsic degrees of freedom and express their influence on the complementary extrinsic dynamics in terms of gauge potentials .",
    "for example , it might be appropriate to regard the fast and slow degrees of freedom of a many - body system , for which the born - oppenheimer approximation  @xcite applies , as being intrinsic and collective , respectively",
    ". a model description of the scattering of two nuclei for which the motions of their centres of mass are _ adiabatic _ in comparison to their intrinsic degrees of freedom would be a candidate for such a separation .",
    "quantum optics also provides examples such as parametric down conversion ( pdc ) that possess useful algebraic models  @xcite ; in the standard description of pdc , strong coherent beams are treated classically while down - converted photon pairs must be described quantally . in physical systems where some degrees of freedom tend to behave in a manifestly quantal way while others are essentially classical , the proposals given in sec .",
    "[ sec : partial ] for deriving partial quantizations have the potential for providing systematic ways of modelling such systems .",
    "in particular , methods are given for constructing semi - classical models in which the intrinsic ( gauge ) degrees of freedom are quantized but the extrinsic dynamics are treated classically .",
    "a problem of considerable interest is the description of vortices in quantum fluids .",
    "this problem has been related to the notoriously difficult task of constructing the unitary irreps of infinite - dimensional groups of diffeomorphisms @xcite .",
    "the potential relevance of the methods proposed in this paper to this problem are indicated by the following observations . a model of linear hydrodynamic flows in nuclei ( the so - called cm(3 ) model )",
    "has been quantized both by induced representation methods @xcite and geometric quantization @xcite .",
    "these quantizations are characterized by quantized vortex spins which are naturally regarded as intrinsic @xmath59 degrees of freedom .",
