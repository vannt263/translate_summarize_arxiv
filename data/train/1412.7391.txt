    "for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we consider @xmath2 particles that are randomly distributed among @xmath3 cells and let @xmath4 the random variables @xmath5 are called _ occupancy numbers _ and their joint distribution is said an _ occupancy model_. note that the vector @xmath6 takes values in the set @xmath7 , defined by @xmath8 an occupancy model is then a probability distribution on @xmath7 and we denote by @xmath9 the family of such probability distributions .",
    "furthermore , the occupancy model is _ exchangeable _ if @xmath5 are exchangeable ; i.e. , @xmath5 has the same distribution of @xmath10 , whenever @xmath11 is a permutation of the indices @xmath12 .",
    "+ the study of problems of placing objects in cells naturally arises in statistical physics in describing the microscopic arrangement of @xmath2 particles ( which might be protons , electrons ,  ) among @xmath3 states ( which might be energy levels ) . in this context",
    "there are three well - known examples of exchangeable occupancy distributions : maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) , bose - einstein ( be ) and fermi - dirac ( fd ) .",
    "one says that distinguishable ( indistinguishable , respectively ) particles that are not subject to the pauli exclusion principle obey mb statistics ( be , respectively ) . if , however , the particles are indistinguishable and subject to exclusion principle , they obey fd statistics .",
    "for example , electrons , protons and neutrons obey fd statistics ; whereas photons and pions obey be statistics .",
    "+ in the sequel we will refer to mb , be and fd as the _ classical _ occupancy models . in table",
    "[ tab : classical_eoms ] of section  [ sect : ma ] a more mathematical description of their main features is given .",
    "see @xcite for further details . + it is interesting to understand why such models have a so fundamental role within the family of eoms . in this respect , as an instrument to investigate and characterize what are the features that may justify the privileged position of mb , be and fd statistics , in @xcite the authors introduced a remarkable subclass of eoms : the @xmath13-models .",
    "+ the set of @xmath13-models is a wide family of eoms , where every element of the class can be obtained through conditionally i.i.d . random variables with laws in the exponential family . besides",
    ", in particular , it contains the classical models .",
    "+ we point out that this family is of interest in its own .",
    "@xcite focus on eoms and their relations with the uniform order statistics property ( uosp ) for discrete time counting processes .",
    "they show how definitions and results presented in @xcite and @xcite can be unified and generalized in the frame of @xmath13-models .",
    "in particular , they allow to define a _ generalized uosp _ for the conditional distribution of the jump amounts given a certain number of arrivals . for processes with this property ,",
    "they prove several characterizations in terms of @xmath13-type distributions .",
    "+ moreover , the authors show that the @xmath14-class is closed under some natural transformations of eoms as the dropping of particles and the conditioning on a given occupancy sub - model .",
    "see section [ sect : merging ] for precise definitions and related results .",
    "+ in this paper we still concentrate our attention on @xmath13-models . more precisely , we introduce and study a new transformation of occupancy models , called _ merging _ , that turns out to play a major role within the family of @xmath13-models .",
    "our aim is twofold . on the one hand , we investigate the algebraic properties of such application and how they reflect on the @xmath14-class . on the other ,",
    "we exploit these results to explain the relation between occupancy distributions of the type @xmath14 and scale - consistent maximum entropy problems .",
    "+ from the probabilistic point of view , the analysis of the merging transformation in the context of @xmath13-models leads to a better understanding of the structure of this class .",
    "in fact , it suggests a decomposition in two subclasses : the first comprises _ indecomposable _ models , i.e. models that can not be obtained through merging ; the second consists of the remaining ones , that is _",
    "decomposable _ models , derivable by merging .",
    "for instance , be and fd distributions give rise to indecomposable occupancy models ; whereas , a well known example of decomposable distribution is the _ pseudo - contagious _ model introduced by @xcite and reconsidered by @xcite .",
    "other examples are given in section [ sect : merging ] .",
    "+ the decomposition just described above relies on the closure of the class @xmath14 under merging and moreover , on the complete characterization we can provide of the occupancy model obtained after applying this transformation . +",
    "as previously mentioned , these are relevant facts for our purposes , since they are of potential interest in applications .",
    "indeed , we conclude the manuscript by showing a connection between @xmath13-models and _ entropy maximization ( maxent ) inference_. + @xcite observe that the solution of maxent depends on the scale at which the method is applied and , as a consequence , highlight the relevance of the choice of the observation scale when estimating an occupancy distribution . for this reason",
    ", they introduce the concept of _ scale - consistency_. roughly speaking , a maxent distribution is self - consistent in the case when , if a different coarse - graining on cell size is considered , the type of probability distribution that solves the maximization problem does not change .",
    "+ @xcite obtain mb and be as solutions of some maxent problems which are relevant in ecology for estimating the abundance of species . moreover , as far as scale - consistency is concerned , they show that mb satisfies this property and be does not .",
    "+ a crucial remark is that our merging transformation coincides with the change of coarse - graining on cell size ( _ scale transformation _ ) suggested by @xcite .",
    "therefore , in view of this result , we make clear ( and formally prove ) the reason why mb is scale - consistent , while be is not .",
    "furthermore , we are able to exhibit a whole family of self - consistent distributions .",
    "see section  [ sect : merging ] and section  [ sect : maxent ] , respectively .",
    "+    the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : ma ] we recall the class of @xmath14-models along with some of its basic features and some related results in the framework of discrete time counting processes .",
    "section  [ sect : merging ] is devoted to defining the merging transformation and to presenting our results concerned with its characterization .",
    "in addition , we also analyze the interplay between the new proposal and transformations previously introduced in @xcite . in section  [ sect : maxent ] we discuss the role of @xmath13-models in the context of entropy maximization inference .",
    "all proofs , if not immediate , are collected in appendix  [ sect : proofs ] .",
    "this family is parametrized by a function and @xmath15 is distributed according to the exchangeable occupancy model @xmath16 if its distribution @xmath17 has the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the normalizing constant .",
    "+ we recall that the classical models can be recovered with specific choices of the function @xmath20 .",
    "notice that they are respectively obtained by letting @xmath21     we summarize the main characteristics of such models in table  [ tab : classical_eoms ] below .",
    ".main features of the classical occupancy models .",

    "this prove the first assertion in the statement . to conclude",
    "it remains to show that the following diagram commutes : @xmath52_-{k_1 } \\ar@{->}@//[r]^-{i_s } & \\mathcal{m}^{(a')}_{n , r } \\ar@//[d]^-{k_1 } \\\\",

    "we must show that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the same occupancy model over @xmath7 ; i.e. that the following diagram commutes : @xmath61_-{k^{ns , r}_{ns , r } } \\ar@{->}@//[r]^-{i_s } & \\mathcal{m}^{(a')}_{n , r } \\ar@//[d]^-{k^{n , r}_{n , r } } \\\\ \\mathcal{m}^{(a)}_{ns , r } \\ar@{->}@//[r]_-{i_s } & \\mathcal{m}^{(a')}_{n , r }   } \\ ] ] the proof relies on the closure property of the @xmath14 class with respect to transformation @xmath62 . let @xmath63 denote the occupancy numbers of @xmath64 and @xmath65 those of @xmath66 . + we start by determining the probability distribution corresponding to @xmath67 .",
    "since @xmath68 is a @xmath69-model with @xmath70 , by proposition  [ prop:6.5 ] we get @xmath71 on the other hand , if we consider @xmath72 , by using proposition  [ prop:6.5 ] we obtain @xmath73 and then , by applying @xmath74 it gives @xmath75 where @xmath76 are the occupancy numbers of a @xmath39-model .",
    "the conclusion follows by observing that and are equal , since holds .",
    "the proof relies on the technique of lagrange multipliers .",

    "if the constraints can not be satisfied for any values of @xmath87 s , then the maximum entropy distribution does not exist .",
    "+ uniqueness of the maxent solution follows from the convexity of entropy together with the linearity of the constraints .      by adapting the general solution to our specific case",
