    "the first step in studying the low - energy dynamics of supersymmetric gauge theories  @xcite is determining the structure of the moduli space .",
    "the moduli space can always be described in terms of the expectation value of composite fields which are gauge invariant polynomials constructed out of the microscopic chiral matter superfields  @xcite . in general , the gauge invariant polynomials are subject to constraints .",
    "one can always choose a basic set of linearly independent composite fields such that all gauge invariant composites can be written as polynomials in the basic set . all constraints among gauge invariant composites are then reduced to nonlinear constraints among the basic set of invariants . given the description of the classical moduli space , one can use symmetry arguments , the semi - classical limit , and various deformations of the theory to learn about the quantum behavior .",
    "deformations such as adding mass terms or breaking the gauge group by the higgs mechanism are particularly useful , and one can often use them to relate one theory to another theory whose low - energy description is already known .    in this article",
    "we examine all asymptotically - free theories with a free algebra of invariants .",
    "we consider theories with simple gauge groups and no tree - level superpotentials . by a free algebra of invariants",
    "we mean that the full classical moduli space is described in terms of independent gauge invariants which are not subject to any constraints . in a previous paper",
    "@xcite a class of free - algebra theories was studied in which flavor anomalies are saturated by the basic gauge invariants .",
    "it was shown that , in most cases , matching of anomalies together with the requirement of a free algebra implied the existence of a branch of the theory with no dynamically generated superpotential . in this paper , we extend the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to all theories with a free algebra of invariants .",
    "we expect different explanations for the lack of anomaly matching between the microscopic theory and the composites parameterizing the moduli space depending on the relative value of the dynkin index of the matter fields , @xmath5 , and the dynkin index of the adjoint , @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath7 , a dynamically generated superpotential is allowed by symmetries .",
    "such a superpotential lifts the classical moduli space leaving no stable vacuum state .",
    "we explicitly check that in all cases where anomalies do not match a superpotential is indeed dynamically generated .",
    "maximally breaking the original gauge group often leaves a pure yang - mills theory with gauge group @xmath8 , and gaugino condensation in this minimal unbroken subgroup generates a dynamical superpotential . when the gauge group is completely broken , one can check that instanton contributions are responsible for generating a dynamical superpotential .",
    "there is an interesting difference between those theories with @xmath7 where anomalies do match at the origin , and those where they do not . in theories where the anomalies match at the origin , the minimal unbroken gauge group @xmath8 is a product group , with identical factors ( e.g. @xmath9 ) .",
    "the dynamical superpotential is generated by gaugino condensation in the components of @xmath8 , leading to a multi - branched theory . for at least one branch of the theory ,",
    "the superpotential generated by the various factors cancels , leading to a branch with @xmath1  @xcite . in theories where anomalies do not match at the origin",
    ", @xmath8 is such that it is impossible to have a @xmath1 branch , and the theory always has a non - zero dynamical superpotential . when @xmath10 , all free algebra theories have unbroken @xmath11 gauge symmetries in the bulk of the moduli space , a fact recently noticed in ref .  @xcite . in this case , after including photons and sometimes also massless monopoles in the low - energy spectrum , anomalies are saturated at the origin . for @xmath12 , we argue based on flows that the free algebra theories are in an interacting non - abelian coulomb phase at the origin of the moduli spaces . theories with @xmath5 @xmath13 , @xmath14 , or @xmath15 @xmath6 can only flow via the higgs mechanism to other theories of the same type .",
    "free algebra theories have been classified in the mathematics literature  @xcite . after selecting theories free of gauge anomalies it turns out that all @xmath7 examples have no constraints among the basic invariants  @xcite .",
    "the requirement that the theory have no gauge anomalies is essential for the result , which is why this fact was not noticed earlier in the mathematics literature .",
    "we also recall little known theorems proven in the mathematics literature which are helpful in analyzing supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "first , theories that have unbroken @xmath11 s in the bulk of the moduli space must have @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "second , any theory with @xmath12 has completely broken gauge group in the bulk of the moduli space  @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we analyze the low - energy dynamics of the free algebra theories .",
    "a particularly interesting example studied in detail is the @xmath2 gauge theory with a spinor .",
    "this is a theory with @xmath16 which flows via the higgs mechanism to a theory with a @xmath1 branch .",
    "a complete list of free algebra theories with @xmath7 is presented in appendix a. there , we also indicate patterns of gauge symmetry breaking for these theories . in appendix b ,",
    "we discuss more mathematical issues .",
    "we derive a formula for the dimension of the classical moduli space , which is found to be equal to the number of microscopic degrees of freedom minus the dimension of the gauge group plus the dimension of the smallest unbroken subgroup . in applying this formula",
    ", one needs to be careful about the possibility that the smallest unbroken subgroup at a d - flat point is not the same as the smallest unbroken subgroup preserved by an arbitrary field configuration .",
    "this possibility occurs for @xmath17 gauge group with a single spinor field and the @xmath18 theory with an antisymmetric tensor and @xmath19 antifundamentals .",
    "the moduli space of supersymmetric gauge theories can be parameterized by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of gauge invariant polynomials made out of matter superfields . for any theory",
    "there is a minimal set of invariants . in general ,",
    "the basic gauge invariants are not independent , but are subject to nonlinear constraints .",
    "the vevs allowed by these constraints are in one - to - one correspondence with the d - flat configurations of the microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "some theories , however , have unconstrained basic gauge invariants .",
    "these theories are the subject of this paper .",
    "we give a precise definition of classical moduli space and free algebra of invariants in appendix  b , where we also explain how to calculate the dimension of the moduli space .",
    "all theories with a free algebra of invariants together with their basic set of invariants are given in refs .",
    "we restrict our attention to physical theories , that is those which are free of gauge anomalies .",
    "since the dynamics of the free algebra theories with anomaly matching between the microscopic fields and the basic gauge invariants was already studied  @xcite , we now consider only cases where anomalies do not match .",
    "we present all the cases in the following sections , dividing them according to the kind of non - perturbative effects that take place .",
    "we will frequently consider theories along a flat direction , which partially or completely breaks the gauge group .",
    "it is easy to see that the sign of @xmath20 is preserved under such higgs flow .",
    "in fact , when @xmath21 is broken to a subgroup @xmath22 , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is an integer , @xmath25 is computed in @xmath21 , and @xmath26 is computed in @xmath22 .",
    "the value of @xmath24 depends on the embedding of @xmath22 in @xmath21 , and it is the @xmath21 winding number of the unit @xmath22 instanton .",
    "it is a straightforward , yet tedious , exercise to select all physical theories with @xmath7 among the free - algebra models of ref .",
    "we list all of these theories in appendix  a. for each theory we give a sample pattern of symmetry breaking and the smallest unbroken subgroup along a generic flat direction .",
    "it turns out that there are no other @xmath7 theories besides the ones with a free algebra  @xcite .",
    "such statement is not true for theories with gauge anomalies .",
    "for example , an unphysical @xmath27 theory with @xmath28 fields in the fundamental representation and no fields in the antifundamental representation has constraints among the basic gauge invariants .",
    "the basic gauge invariants are @xmath29 , which obey the constraint equations @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath11 global symmetries , including the r - symmetry , restrict the form of a dynamically generated superpotential . in terms of the microscopic matter fields , @xmath31 ,",
    "the superpotential can be written as  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the dynkin index of the @xmath34-th representation and @xmath35 .",
    "whenever @xmath7 such a superpotential has a good classical behavior .",
    "@xmath36 occurs in the numerator , so that @xmath37 for large values of the fields . for @xmath38 ,",
    "r symmetry prohibits the generation of a superpotential . for @xmath12 ,",
    "a dynamical superpotential can not be generated in the free algebra theories , since @xmath36 occurs in the denominator , and @xmath39 does not have the correct behavior for large values of the fields . in those cases where a quantum superpotential is allowed ,",
    "one still needs to check whether or not it is actually generated by non - perturbative effects .",
    "one way of checking is by integrating out matter fields from theories with a larger number of flavors using the results of refs .",
    "this approach can frequently be very cumbersome as theories with additional matter fields tend to have a large number of basic gauge invariants and complicated superpotentials . here",
    ", we take a different path . we explore points on the moduli space where the original gauge group is broken . the effective theory below the scale of the massive gauge bosons",
    "is frequently known , and is usually easier to analyze than the original theory .",
    "all @xmath40 theories are listed in appendix a. for those analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite for which anomalies match at the origin , the smallest unbroken subgroup at generic points on the moduli space turns out to be a product group .",
    "the remaining pure yang - mills theory exhibits gaugino condensation and has superpotentials generated in each factor group .",
    "the branch with zero superpotential arises due to a cancellation between the contributions from different factor groups to the superpotential .",
    "we now explain why anomalies do not match for the remaining theories .",
    "they are listed in appendix a , and can be divided into three types : ( _ i _ ) the gauge group is completely broken , ( _ ii _ ) it is broken to a simple group , ( _ iii _ ) it is broken to a semi - simple group . for example , @xmath27 with @xmath41 flavors is an example of case ( _ i _ ) ; if the number of flavors is smaller than @xmath41 , it is an example of @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath18 theory with an antisymmetric tensor and its conjugate is an example of ( _ iii _ ) , since the gauge group is broken down to @xmath43 at generic points on the moduli space .    inspecting the table in appendix a",
    "we conclude that in case ( _ i _ ) the higgs flow always contains an @xmath44 group with two fields in the fundamental representation .",
    "the @xmath44 theory with two fundamentals has been shown by an explicit calculation to have a non - zero superpotential generated by instantons  @xcite . using scale - matching relations we checked that this has to be the case for all other theories with completely broken gauge group at generic values of the moduli fields .    in case",
    "( _ ii _ ) , when the maximal breaking leaves a simple group , we can also use the scale matching to show that there is a non - zero superpotential . from the study of supersymmetric qcd  @xcite and other simple groups with fundamental matter fields  @xcite we know that pure @xmath0 yang - mills theories exhibit gaugino condensation , which is responsible for the generation of a superpotential . a large fraction of theories listed in appendix a have a non - zero superpotential due to gaugino condensation in the unbroken subgroup .",
    "we comment on some examples from this class at the end of this section .",
    "the remaining case is when semi - simple groups remain unbroken at the points of maximal breaking .",
    "obviously , gaugino condensation takes place in each unbroken factor , but there is no guarantee that contributions to the superpotential from the different factor groups do not cancel .",
    "after all , this effect was responsible for vanishing superpotentials in theories with anomaly matching .",
    "there are only seven theories without anomaly matching which have unbroken product groups at generic points on the moduli space .",
