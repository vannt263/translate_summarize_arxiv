    "gravitational lensing provides a powerful tool to constrain the dark matter halos of galaxies .",
    "one of the promises of gravitational lenses is to constrain the hubble constant .",
    "however , this has been hampered to some extent by the intrinsic degeneracies in models of the dark matter potential of the lens ( williams & saha 2000 ; saha 2000 ; saha & williams 2001 ; zhao & pronk 2001 ) .",
    "now that the value of @xmath2 is fairly well constrained by independent methods , e.g. , @xmath4  km / s / mpc from the hst key project ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the cosmological model has been determined at more and more precision , it is interesting to ask whether we can reverse the game and set more stringent constraint on the dark matter potential . to this end , we would like to understand whether the hubble constant and the lensed images could uniquely specify the dark matter content , or whether there are very different lens models with identical @xmath2 value .",
    "it is well - known that isothermal models and other simple smooth models of dark matter halos of gravitational lenses often predict a dimensionless time delay @xmath0 much too small to be comfortable with the observed time delays @xmath1 and the widely accepted @xmath2 value ( @xmath3 km / s / mpc ) .",
    "models with isothermal dark halos tend to yield an @xmath2 around 50 km / s / mpc .",
    "this conflict has been highlighted by several recent papers ( kochanek 2002a , b , c ) .",
    "kochanek ( 2002a ) found that it is difficult to reconcile the time delays measured for five simple and well - observed gravitational lenses with @xmath5 km / s / mpc unless the lens galaxy has a nearly keplerian rotation curve with the halo following the stellar mass profile by a constant mass - to - light ( @xmath6 ) ratio .",
    "if the lenses had a more plausible flat rotation curve ( isothermal mass distributions ) he found @xmath7  km / s / mpc , which is grossly inconsistent with the hst key project .",
    "kochanek ( 2002c ) argued that more realistic models with a cdm halo plus adiabatically cooled baryons behave like isothermal models .",
    "they produced a still too low @xmath2 unless one adopts a problematically high baryon fraction @xmath8 of the universe , and require all these baryons to cool .",
    "his conclusion was that either @xmath5 km / s / mpc is too high or any lens mass models for the observed time delay systems must follow a compact distribution , nearly like that of the stellar light , hence has very little extended dark matter halo .",
    "this argued for the first time a _ new problem _ for dark matter halos , and a particularly serious problem for current cdm paradigm of galaxy formation .",
    "here we discuss the effect of a _ new degeneracy _ in strong lensing models in resolving this _ new problem_. it is shown that the observed time delays and image positions can not uniquely determine the extent of the lens mass distribution .",
    "in particular , a system with a very extended dark matter distribution could minic a system without any dark matter as far as strong lensing data are concerned . here",
    "we give an analytical explicit illustration of the degree of degeneracy in lens models .",
    "consider fitting a general quadruple image system with the images at cyclindrical radius @xmath9 for @xmath10 from the lens center ; we shall call the radius to the outermost image the einstein radius @xmath11 .",
    "these images lie at extrema points of the time delay surface .",
    "all lensing properties can be derived from the time delay surfaces . as a minimal model ,",
    "let s consider a spherical lens potential @xmath12 for the stars and the halo plus an external shear potential @xmath13 , the time delay contours are determined by a dimensionless time delay @xmath14 given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the cylindrical radius , all in units of arcsec , and @xmath17 is a constant containing all the dependence on the cosmology @xmath18 and lens and source redshifts @xmath19 .",
    "a minimal model for the external shear is @xmath20 a minimal model for the stars and halo would be a spherical lensing potential @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the total stellar mass enclosed , @xmath23 is the half - mass radius , and @xmath24 specifies the cuspiness of the stellar distribution . here",
    "the halo mass distribution follows the mass of the stars with an adjustable parameter @xmath25 , apart from a to - be - determined halo component @xmath26 .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 are respectively the radii of the images @xmath10 , and the function @xmath29 is given by @xmath30\\\\ & \\sim & 0.0866\\left(1 - 2r^2\\right ) \\qquad \\mbox{~if $ r \\ll 1$,}\\\\ & \\sim & o[(r-1)^3 ] \\qquad \\mbox{~if $ r \\rightarrow 1$,}\\\\ & \\sim & \\ln r \\qquad \\mbox{~if $ r \\gg 1$}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] figure  [ n ] illustrates the function @xmath31 and the first and second derivatives of @xmath29 .    the potential @xmath32 is designed to have the following property : it dominates the stellar potential @xmath33 at radii much larger than the einstein radius @xmath11 with @xmath34 but at small radius @xmath35 is small and has virtually no effect on lensing . in particular",
    ", it keeps the convergence @xmath36 , shear @xmath37 , the components of the amplification matrix @xmath38 and the time delay between images unchanged at the radii of the four images @xmath39 .",
    "in fact it has a vanishing contribution to _ the arrival time surface near the images _ up to the order @xmath40 .",
    "this can be verified by taylor expansion .",
    "it is easy to show ( also cf .",
    "[ n ] ) that the factor @xmath29 and its first and second radial derivatives obey @xmath41 becaue @xmath26 is a multiplications of the four @xmath29 , all of the zeroth , first and second derivatives vanish at the four radii @xmath28 . and",
    "because @xmath26 is azimuthally symmetric , all its azimuthal derivatives with respect to @xmath42 also vanish .",
    "the time delay surface @xmath43 hence when we vary the parameter @xmath44 , the time arrival surface @xmath14 yields the same extrema , or images .",
    "this means models with different @xmath44 ( or halo ) will have goodness of fit to all strong lensing data ( the time delay , the image positions and even the amplifications and parity of the images ) .",
    "it only alters the mass distribution of the lens , e.g. , the total mass of the lens and the spatial extent of the lens . hence it creates a degeneracy in lens modeling , making it problematic to draw unique conclusions on lens halo mass from image modeling .",
    "we note , however , by construction this degeneracy applies only to point images or point sources .",
    "the surface density and mass of the model can be computed as @xmath45 in particular , the density and the mass for the stars only are given by @xmath46 and @xmath47 as we can see the mass in stars has a half - mass radius @xmath48 , and converges to a finite mass @xmath49 at infinity .",
    "the density has an inner cusp @xmath24 , and drops steeply with radius , by a factor of 25/4 from @xmath48 to @xmath50 for cored models ( @xmath51 ) or by a factor of 4 for isothermal cusped models ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the halo component @xmath26 contributes to @xmath53 by a negligible amount @xmath54 for @xmath55 , but contributes to @xmath56 by an amount of the order @xmath57 .",
    "this flattens the rotation curve at large radii .",
    "a flat rotation curve corresponds to a constant deflection strength , @xmath58 which is effectively the rotation curve squared . at large radius",
    "we have @xmath59 in comparsion to the case with only the stars , we have a nearly keplerian rotation curve beyond @xmath50 .",
    "pg1115 + 080 is a quadruple system with a nearly axisymmetric stellar lens at @xmath60 , and the quasar source is at @xmath61 .",
    "we use the photometric data of impey et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for the images a1 , a2 , b , c , and the time delay @xmath62 days between the nearest b image and the furthest c image ( schechter et al .",
    "there is an infared einstein ring of radius @xmath63 .",
    "the stellar lens is well - approximated by a de vaucouleurs profile with a half - light radii of @xmath64 .",
    "since the surface density is nearly cored , we set the cusp slope @xmath65 .",
    "we adopt a @xmath66cdm cosmology with the time delay constant for at the redshifts @xmath67 of pg1115 + 080 given by @xmath68    let s try to fit pg1115 with a halo - free model with @xmath69 .",
    "totally we have five free fitting parameters , with @xmath70 for the lens model , and @xmath71 being a pair of coordinates for the source .",
    "since the four images provide in general at least eight constraints , we do not expect a perfect fit .",
    "nonetheless a reasonable fit can be found for this star - only model , as shown by the time delay contours in figure  [ ctt]a and the cuts in figure  [ ctt]b .",
    "the model yields a time delay @xmath72 between images b and c. compared with measured delay @xmath73 , we find @xmath74 for this star - only model .",
    "the high value of @xmath75 is related to the very small convergence at the einstein radius @xmath11 .",
    "now consider adding the component @xmath32 , i.e. , we increase the value @xmath44 from zero to @xmath76 .",
    "we see no detectable differences in the time delay ( cf . fig .",
    "[ ctt]a and fig .",
    "[ ctt]b ) , hence we still have @xmath77 .",
    "all models predict amplification ratios among the four images to be @xmath78 independent of @xmath44 .",
    "these are in good agreement with the observed infared flux ratios @xmath79 apart from the well - known problematic flux ratio between the close pair @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which has been attributed to either microlensing or lensing by substructures ( e.g. , impey et al .",
    "1998 ; barkana 1997 ; metcalf & zhao 2002 ) .",
    "consistent with kochanek ( 2002b ) , our model density is small near @xmath11 with a convergence @xmath82 independent of @xmath44 ; by construction @xmath32 has a vanishing contribution to the convergence at the images .",
    "but by raising the parameter @xmath44 the models develop a very massive halo at radii @xmath83 with a nearly flat rotation curve ( cf .",
    "[ v ] ) , very different from the model with @xmath69 .",
    "this illustrates an explicit counter example to kochanek s claim of a conflict between lens models with an extended dark halo and @xmath66cdm cosmology with @xmath84 .",
    "we do not find such a conflict .",
    "instead we find that the new mass degeneracy prevents us from drawing a robust conclusion about the dark halo on the basis of the image positions and time delays alone .",
    "as we can see , it is possible to construct many very different models with positive , smooth and monotonic surface densities to fit the image positions .",
    "there are also no extra images .",
    "these models also fit the same time delay and time delay ratios using a hubble constant and cosmology consistent with @xmath66cdm cosmology . hence the models are truely indistinguishable for lensing data .",
    "they fit the flux ratios equally well , and produce nearly indistinguisable einstein rings , which is the region of minimal gradient of the time delay surface .",
    "the models have identical light profiles , undistinguishable by data .    among the acceptable models to pg1115 + 080",
    ", there are models with a keplerian rotation curve and models with a nearly flat rotation curve .",
    "so lensing data plus @xmath2 can not uniquely specify the mass - to - light ratio of this system .",
    "we conclude that strong lensing data may not uniquely determine the hubble constant , even if we fix the cosmology , the lens and source redshifts , and the time delays and amplification ratios of the four images .",
    "there are at least important degeneracies in inverting the data of a perfect einstein cross to the lens models and the hubble constant .",
    "the relation between the value of @xmath2 and the size of the halo is not straightforward : a high @xmath2 does not necessarily mean no dark halo , and models with a flat rotation curve do not always yield a small @xmath2 .",
    "we also comment that it would be difficult to determine the cosmology from strong lensing data alone because the non - uniqueness in the lens models implies that the combined parameter @xmath85 is poorly constrained by the lensing data , even if @xmath75 and the redshifts @xmath19 are given .",
