    "a substantial advancement in astrometric measurements has been achieved by the astrometry mission _ hipparcos _ ( launch : 8 august 1989 ) of european space agency ( esa ) , which has reached an accuracy of a milli - arcsecond ( @xmath1 ) in determining the angular positions of about @xmath2 stars @xcite . meanwhile , the state - of - the - art angular observations have finally arrived at the level of a few micro - acrseconds ( @xmath3 ) @xcite . especially , the stunning progress in astrometry has proceeded with the esa mission _ gaia _",
    "@xcite ( launch : 19 december 2013 ) which aims at an all - sky survey of more than @xmath4 stars of our galaxy and targets angular accuracy of up to a few @xmath3 for bright stars in the final catalog scheduled for publication in 2022 .    in view of these advancements",
    "it becomes obvious that future astrometry is going to force into the exciting areas of sub-@xmath3 or even nano - arcsecond ( nas ) level of accuracy . to step up efforts toward sub -- astrometry is of fundamental importance in astronomy and astrophysics .",
    "for example , an accuracy of about @xmath5 in angular resolution would allow for direct measurement of trigonometric parallaxes of stars belonging to galaxies of the local group which spans a diameter of about @xmath6 light - years , that means would enable to determine spatial distances of extra - galactic objects independently of dynamical models of the universe .",
    "moreover , also extremely high - precision tests of relativity , detection of dark - matter distributions within or outside of our galaxy , determination of stellar and galactic kinematics , and finally even the discovery of one - earth - mass exoplanets in the habitable zone of nearby sun - like stars would be possible by means of sub-@xmath3-astrometry .",
    "recently , there are several mission proposals in this respect .",
    "for instance , the mission neat @xcite has been proposed to esa which intends to reach a precision of about @xmath7 in angular resolution for being able to detect earth - like exoplanets surrounding stars in the stellar neighborhood of the sun .",
    "further space missions like astrod @xcite , lator @xcite , odyssey @xcite , sagas @xcite , or tipo @xcite have been proposed to esa which imply the determination of light trajectory through the solar system on sub-@xmath8 or even at @xmath9 level of accuracy .",
    "also earth - bound telescopes are under consideration which aim at angular resolutions of about @xmath5 @xcite .    but , although in view of the recent impressive achievements , the step from @xmath3-astrometry toward sub-@xmath3-level or even nas - level of accuracy in angular resolution will surely be a long - term goal in the astronomical science .",
    "this is because the envisaged advancement toward space - based @xmath9-astrometry implies many subtle effects and new kind of challenges which have not been encountered before : what kind of optical technology would allow for nas - astrometry ?",
    "is it technologically possible to measure the velocity of spacecraft ( observer ) with sufficient accuracy allowing for a precise determination of aberrational effects ?",
    "how accurate do we have to determine the ephemeris of the solar system bodies and could such precise ephemeris be provided ?",
    "is it possible to model accurate enough the influence of interstellar medium on light propagation ?",
    "how strong is the effect of gravitational waves on light propagation on nano - arcsecond level ?",
    "how is it possible to account for the gravitational light deflection caused by massive bodies located outside the solar system ?    each of these and many other problems have to be clarified before @xmath9-astrometry becomes feasible .",
    "but certainly , the fundamental assignment in astrometry remains to trace a lightray observed in the solar system back to the celestial light source .",
    "the importance of this fact has also been underlined recently by the esa - senior - survey - committee ( ssc ) in response of the selection of science themes for the l2 and l3 launch opportunities , where it has been stated that `` _",
    "ssc recommends that proper modeling tools , most notably the availability of a general relativistic framework able to model photon trajectories to the accuracy required should be given the proper attention to prove feasibility _ '' of high - precision astrometry @xcite . according to this , the primary effort in any astrometrical framework concerns the precise description of the light trajectory , that is to say the determination of the spatial coordinates of a light - signal as function of coordinate time , @xmath10 , in some global coordinate system .",
    "accordingly , the principal purpose of this investigation is the determination of the trajectory of a light - signal propagating through the solar system . in the following four subsections it will be enlightened how one has to proceed in order to arrive that goal : ( a ) the theory of light propagation , ( b ) the post - newtonian expansion , ( c ) the state - of - the - art , and ( d ) the primary objective of this investigation .      the determination of spatial coordinates of the lightray takes the most simple form in the flat minkowskian space - time and assuming a cartesian coordinate system which covers the entire space , implying the metric tensor @xmath11 .",
    "suppose the light - signal is emitted at some initial time @xmath12 by a light source located at some space - point @xmath13 , then the light trajectory is simply given by a straight line which is also called unperturbed light trajectory , @xmath14    where the unit - vector @xmath15 determines the direction of light - propagation and the sublabel `` @xmath16 '' denotes newtonian approximation .    in general relativity",
    "the four - dimensional space - time in the presence of matter is curved , that means is described by a semi - riemannian manifold with non - vanishing curvature tensor rather than a flat minkowskian space - time , and a light trajectory is no longer a straight line but propagates along a so - called null geodesic , which generalizes the concept of a straight light trajectory .",
    "the four - coordinates @xmath17 of a light trajectory depend on some affine curve - parameter @xmath18 , and are determined by the geodesic equation @xcite ,    @xmath19    @xmath20    where ( [ geodetic_equation ] ) represents the geodesic equation , while the isotropic condition ( [ geodetic_equation1 ] ) is an additional constraint for a null geodesic , a term which refers to the fact that the invariant line element vanishes , @xmath21 , at any point along the light trajectory . the christoffel symbols in ( [ geodetic_equation ] ) are related to the metric of curved space - time as follows : @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the contravariant and covariant components of the metric tensor , respectively , where the metric signature @xmath25 .",
    "the geodesic equation ( [ geodetic_equation ] ) represents a second - order differential equation , hence an unique solution implies the need of two initial values for the lightray : @xmath26    the equations in ( [ geodetic_equation ] ) - ( [ geodetic_equation1 ] ) are valid in any reference system .",
    "but in practical astrometry one is necessarily enforced to specify the reference systems for concrete observational data . in line with the recommendations of the international astronomical union ( iau )",
    "@xcite , the barycentric celestial reference system ( bcrs ) with coordinates @xmath27 is the standard global chart to be used in modern - day astrometry , where @xmath28 is the bcrs coordinate - time and @xmath29 are cartesian - like spatial coordinates from the barycenter of the solar system to some field - point .",
    "consequently , it becomes much preferable to exploit the freedom in the choice of scalar curve - parameter @xmath18 and to rewrite the affinely parametrized geodesic equation ( [ geodetic_equation ] ) and the isotropic condition ( [ geodetic_equation1 ] ) in terms of bcrs coordinate - time @xcite :    @xmath30    @xmath31    the zeroth component in ( [ geodetic_equation2 ] ) does not carry any new information because it vanishes identically . in order to determine the solution of ( [ geodetic_equation2 ] ) it is advantageous to transform the initial conditions in ( [ initial_value_a ] ) - ( [ initial_value_b ] ) into initial - boundary conditions @xcite : @xmath32    with ( [ introduction_6 ] ) being the position of the light source at the moment @xmath12 of emission of the light - signal and ( [ introduction_7 ] ) being the unit - direction of the lightray at past - null infinity .",
    "then , the exact solution of ( [ geodetic_equation2 ] ) for the light trajectory from the light source through the solar system toward the observer can be written as follows , @xmath33    where the term @xmath34 denotes gravitational corrections to the unperturbed light trajectory ( [ introduction_1 ] ) .",
    "the correction terms @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ introduction_5 ] ) are highly complicated expressions which can not be determined exactly and one has to resort on approximation schemes .",
    "such an approximation scheme is provided by the post - newtonian expansion of the metric of solar system , which represents an expansion in terms of inverse power of the speed of light , up to terms of the order @xmath35 given by : @xmath36    where @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "the justification of such an expansion is based on the fact that the gravitational fields in the solar system are weak , @xmath39 , as well as the velocities of the solar system bodies are slow , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 means mass , radius , and velocity , respectively , of some massive body @xmath44 . for these reasons the post - newtonian expansion",
    "is also called weak - field slow - motion expansion . as outlined in @xcite",
    ", such an expansion is valid inside the near - zone of the solar system , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a characteristic wavelength of gravitational waves emitted by the solar system .",
    "the near - zone of solar system is so large that it still contains all solar system bodies and even encompasses the nearest stars of the stellar neighborhood of the sun .    inserting the expansion ( [ post_newtonian_metric_c ] ) into ( [ geodetic_equation2 ] )",
    "yields the geodesic equations for lightrays up to terms of the order @xmath47 .",
    "accordingly , the expansion of the metric in ( [ post_newtonian_metric_c ] ) inherits a corresponding expansion of the lightray , that means the corrections to the unperturbed lightray can formally be written as follows : @xmath48    where @xmath49 are 1pn corrections , @xmath50 are 1.5pn corrections , and @xmath51 are 2pn corrections to the unperturbed lightray . in view of the fact that the post - newtonian expansion of the metric ( [ post_newtonian_metric_c ] ) is only valid within the near - zone of the solar system , the post - newtonian expansion of the lightray ( [ light_trajectory_2pn ] )",
    "allows for near - zone astrometry , in particular for reduction of astrometric observations of all solar system objects .",
    "the unique interpretation of astrometrical data of far objects , like stars or quasars , is the subject of far - zone astrometry and necessitates the determination of light trajectory outside the near - zone of the solar system .",
    "that especially means , the light trajectory in the near - zone has to be aligned with the light trajectory in the far - zone by means of a so - called matching procedure as described in detail in @xcite which , however , will not be a topic of this investigation .",
    "a brief survey about the present status in the theory of light propagation in the gravitational field of massive bodies has recently been presented @xcite . here",
    "we will summarize and update that survey .",
    "in particular , we will restrict our review on those investigations where the explicit time - dependence of the photon s spatial coordinate , @xmath10 , has been determined , a prerequisite for interpreting real astrometrical observations .",
    "the case of light propagation in the schwarzschild metric , i.e. in the gravitational field of one spherically symmetric massive body at rest , @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the constant position of the body , is the most simple case and has been determined long time ago in 1pn approximation , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the solution for the light trajectory is given by eq .",
    "( [ 1pn_solution_a ] ) . besides its simplicity ,",
    "the determination of the photon s spatial coordinate in the schwarzschild - field is the initial point in the theory of light propagation in astrometry .      in reality , the bodies @xmath54 of the solar system move along their time - like worldlines @xmath55 and for todays extremely high - precision in astrometric measurements the gravitational field of some solar system body can not any longer be treated as static and spherically symmetric . in a first approximation ,",
    "the motion of one massive body @xmath44 can be considered as translational motion with constant velocity @xmath56 : @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the spatial position and velocity of the body @xmath44 at some initial time - moment @xmath60 .",
    "the light - trajectory in the field of one massive body in translational motion has completely been solved in 1pn approximation in @xcite .",
    "this solution has later been rederived by means of a suitable lorentz transformation @xcite . following a suggestion in @xcite , in the investigation",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the free parameter @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ worldline_introduction_b ] ) should be chosen as the time - moment of closest approach ( given by eqs .",
    "( [ time_of_closest_approach_t_0_moving_body ] ) and ( [ time_of_closest_approach_t_1_moving_body ] ) ) between the massive body @xmath44 and the photon in order to minimize the residual effects caused by the approximation of the real motion by a translational motion of the massive body . with the aid of advanced integration methods , originally introduced in @xcite and further developed in @xcite ,",
    "a rigorous solution for the trajectory of a light - signal through the gravitational field of an arbitrarily moving body has thoroughly been solved in @xcite in the first post - minkowskian approximation .",
    "the first post - minkowskian approximation takes into account all terms proportional to the gravitational constant and especially all terms to any power in @xmath61 , hence the body can even be in ultra - relativistic motion and , therefore , the post - minkowskian approximation is often called _ weak - field approximation _ opposite to the post - newtonian approximation which is called _ weak - field slow - motion approximation_. comparing the solution in @xcite with @xcite , it has been demonstrated in @xcite that the simpler solution for the light - trajectory in the field of a uniformly moving body is actually sufficient for high - precision astrometry on sub -- level provided the free parameter @xmath60 is chosen either as time - moment of closest approach or as retarded time - moment ( given by eq .",
    "( [ retarded_time ] ) ) between the photon and the position of the massive body .",
    "all these results agree with our investigation in @xcite for the case of bodies in slow - motion .",
    "the light trajectory in the gravitational field of one body at rest having spin - dipole @xmath62 has first been solved in @xcite and later confirmed in @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of light deflection due to the rotational motion of solar system bodies has been determined in @xcite and turns out to be significant for astrometry on sub -- level of accuracy .      in @xcite an explicit solution for the light - trajectory in the field of @xmath0 uniformly moving bodies with intrinsic",
    "spin has been obtained . a comprehensive solution in 1 pm approximation for the light - trajectory in the field of @xmath0 arbitrarily moving",
    "bodies with individual spin - structure has been derived in @xcite using the already mentioned advanced integration methods originally developed in @xcite .",
    "the solution for the light - trajectory in the field of mass - quadrupoles at rest in 1pn approximation was given in @xcite and later in @xcite .",
    "especially , in @xcite the magnitude of light deflection caused by the mass - quadrupole structure of solar system bodies has been determined , where it was figured out that astrometry on -level of accuracy is able to detect this light deflection effect .",
    "in fact , the light deflection due to the quadrupole - structure of jupiter is presently under investigation by the esa astrometry - mission gaia @xcite .",
    "the light trajectory in the field of @xmath0 arbitrarily slowly - moving bodies with quadrupole structure has been determined in @xcite .",
    "recently , the light - trajectory in the field of @xmath0 uniformly moving bodies with mass - quadrupole structure has also been obtained in @xcite by integrating the geodesic equations for the lightray .",
    "another interesting approach has been found in @xcite , which is based on the time transfer function ( ttf ) which avoids to solve the geodesic equations and hence circumvents some of its involved peculiarities .      a fruitful and systematic approach which allows to integrate analytically the geodesic equations in 1.5 approximation in the field of one body at rest having full time - independent mass - multipoles @xmath63 and spin - multipoles @xmath64 to any order in the multi - index @xmath65 has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "the advanced integration method in @xcite has been developed further in @xcite for the case of time - dependent mass - multipoles @xmath66 and spin - multipoles @xmath67 in 1 pm approximation . using this advanced approach",
    "the analytical solution in 1 pm approximation for the light - trajectory in the field of one massive body at rest with the full set of time - dependent multipoles has been determined in @xcite .",
    "one comment should be in order at this stage .",
    "namely , it is of course possible to interpret the solar system just as one global massive body @xmath44 which consists of many individual small massive bodies .",
    "but then the solution in @xcite has to be interpreted as still expressed in terms of global multipoles @xmath68 and @xmath69 which characterize the entire multipole structure of the solar system as a whole .",
    "however , physically meaningful multipoles can only be defined in the local reference system of each individual massive body .",
    "this important issue will later be further considered in some more detail .",
    "another approach is based on the solution for the ttf and its spatial derivative .",
    "a corresponding multipole decomposition of the ttf has been applied in @xcite in order to determine the coordinate travel time and the light deflection of a lightray in the gravitational field of one axisymmetric body at rest expressed in terms of mass - multipoles @xmath70 .      in @xcite the ttf approach in 1 pm approximation has been applied for the case of light propagation in the field of one axisymmetric body in uniform motion .",
    "especially , an expression for the ttf and its spatial derivative is obtained for this case , which allows to determine astrometric observables like the coordinate travel time of the lightray , the direction of an incident lightray , and the gauge - invariant angle between the direction of two incoming photons .",
    "a similar investigation has been done in @xcite , where the ttf approach has been used in order to determine the coordinate travel time of a lightray in the field of one slowly and uniformly moving extended body with full mass - multipole and spin - multipole structure .",
    "light propagation 2pn approximation is not on the scope of the presented investigation , but for reasons of completeness some results obtained in 2pn approximation will briefly be mentioned , not only because of its relevance for future high - precision astrometry on sub -- level of accuracy but also for its importance in todays high - precision astrometry on -level .",
    "an important progress has been made in @xcite , where an analytical solution of the light - trajectory in 2pn approximation has been determined with explicit time - dependence of the photon s spatial coordinates by solving the null geodesic equations .",
    "this solution has later been confirmed by several progressing and ongoing investigations @xcite , and has also been determined in this investigation , see eqs .",
    "( [ 2pn_solution_brumberg_2 ] ) - ( [ vectorial_function_b2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite the time - derivative of the light trajectory in the field of two pointlike bodies at rest has been obtained , allowing to determine the light deflection in such a system .",
    "an important new result of this investigation is the fact that the 2pn two - body effect in the solar system is less than @xmath71 which considerably simplifies future analytical investigations for high - precision astrometry on sub -- level of accuracy .    in @xcite the general formalism of how to determine the ttf and its derivatives",
    "has been extended up to the second post - newtonian ( 2pn ) and second post - minkowskian ( 2 pm ) order , that means including all terms to order @xmath72 .",
    "the formalism has finally been specified for the case of light propagation in the gravitational field of one spherically symmetric body at rest where the 2 pm and 2pn approximations become identically . especially , explicit expressions for the coordinate travel time of lightray , for the direction of the lightray , and for the angular separation between two incident lightrays have been obtained .",
    "finally , we also mention another approach which is based on the eikonal concept @xcite , where the light trajectory in 2pn approximation in the field of one spherically symmetric body at rest has also been derived .",
    "the results of this work completely agree with @xcite .      according to the survey given above about the present situation in the theory of light propagation ,",
    "thus far there is no analytical solution available for the light trajectory in the field of arbitrarily moving extended bodies in 1.5pn approximation which , however , is of decisive importance in future high - precision astrometric measurements on sub -- level of accuracy and its foreseen involved massive computations , see also @xcite . in respect thereof , two important aspects",
    "must carefully be treated :    ( * 1 * ) the metric perturbations in the exterior of the massive bodies can be decomposed in terms of global mass - multipoles @xmath73 and global spin - multipoles @xmath74 @xcite : @xmath75    these global mass and spin multipoles describe the gravitational field of the solar system as a whole .",
    "however , from the theory of relativistic reference systems it is clear that physically meaningful multipole moments of a massive body @xmath44 have to be defined in the body s local reference system @xmath76 tied to that body under consideration .",
    "such multipoles are called intrinsic mass - multipoles @xmath70 and intrinsic spin - multipoles @xmath77 .",
    "then the question arises about how to express the global bcrs metric in terms of such intrinsic multipoles , that is to say how to determine the global metric perturbations : @xmath78    such a framework has been elaborated by the approach of _ damour - soffel - xu _ ( dsx ) @xcite and within the _ brumberg - kopeikin _ ( bk )",
    "formalisms @xcite , both of which became a part of the iau resolutions @xcite .",
    "( * 2 * ) the second issue concerns the motion of the massive solar system bodies .",
    "while in first approximation these bodies orbit the barycenter of the solar system along ellipse - shaped trajectories , in reality their orbital motion @xmath55 is highly complicated due to the mutual interactions among these bodies .",
    "the worldlines of all massive bodies can be concretized by solar system ephemeris @xcite at any stage of the calculations .",
    "one might prefer to series expand these worldlines as follows : @xmath79    where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath80 are the position , velocity and acceleration of body @xmath44 at some time - moment @xmath60 .",
    "however , such an approach is problematic mainly for two reasons :    1 .",
    "all terms of the infinite series expansion ( [ worldline_introduction ] ) contribute on 1pn or 1.5pn level , because the expansion in ( [ worldline_introduction ] ) is not performed with respect to the inverse powers of the speed of light .",
    "2 .   the time - moment @xmath60 remains an open parameter as long as no additional arguments are introduced , which would uniquely allow to identify that parameter with the time of closest approach or with the retarded time .",
    "these both aspects ( * 1 * ) and ( * 2 * ) enforce to determine the light trajectory @xmath10 of a light - signal from the celestial light source toward the observer as function of intrinsic multipoles @xmath63 and @xmath64 as well as function of the arbitrary worldlines @xmath55 of these massive solar system bodies .    in a previous investigation @xcite a solution for the light trajectory in 1pn approximation in the gravitational field of @xmath0 massive bodies in arbitrary motion and expressed in terms of their intrinsic multipoles has been obtained : @xmath81    however , as outlined in more detail in @xcite , such 1pn solution is not sufficient for astrometry on sub -- level of accuracy .",
    "for instance , the rotational motion of the massive bodies can not be taken into account in 1pn approximation . however , the impact of the spin - dipole structure of the massive bodies on light deflection amounts to be about @xmath82 @xmath83 , @xmath84 @xmath83 , and @xmath85 @xmath83 for a grazing lightray at sun , jupiter , and saturn , respectively @xcite . moreover , also higher spin - multipoles have a significant impact on sub -- level @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in 1pn approximation there are no terms proportional to @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the mass - quadrupole term .",
    "already a straightforward estimate reveals that such terms become relevant on sub -- level of accuracy @xcite , see also table [ table3 ] . in order to scrutinize the impact of such terms one",
    "is necessarily enforced to determine the 1.5pn solution for the light trajectory .    in view of these facts ,",
    "the primary goal of this investigation is to determine a solution for the light trajectory in 1.5pn approximation , which includes all terms up to the order @xmath88 , where both of the important aspects ( * 1 * ) and @xmath89 addressed above are fully taken into account : @xmath90    especially , the massive bodies of the solar system are allowed to move along arbitrary worldlines @xmath55 and they are having arbitrary shape and inner structure and rotational motion , given in terms of time - dependent intrinsic mass - multipoles @xmath66 and spin - multipoles @xmath67 , in accordance with the iau recommendations @xcite and the theory of relativistic reference systems @xcite .",
    "the given solution for the light trajectory is considered as a further step towards a consistent model of general - relativistic theory of light propagation in the gravitational field of the solar system , which finally aims at accuracies on @xmath91 - -level and even on nas - level .",
