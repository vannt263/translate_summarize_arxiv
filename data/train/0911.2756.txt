    "the latter obeys a johnson - segalman constitutive law and more general models are studied in an appendix .",
    "the geometry is 2d , horizontally infinite and vertically bounded by a rigid bottom and a free boundary .",
    "gravity and surface tension are the only external forces . + unless specified , all the articles mentionned hereafter consider viscous fluids obeying the navier - stokes equations , but not viscoelastic fluids obeying more complex laws .",
    "a similar problem in a _ bounded _ geometry ( drop of a fluid ) was dealt with in numerous articles by solonnikov .",
    "he wrote an article @xcite in 1977 in which he proved the local in time unique solvability in the hlder space @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) ( no surface tension ) .",
    "he also proved the global existence with no source term and sufficiently small initial data in @xcite in the space @xmath4 with @xmath5 ( no surface tension ) . more recently shibata and shimizu @xcite improved this result in @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and still with no surface tension .",
    "the latter article also contains an interesting review and related problems .",
    "surface tension was included in other articles by solonnikov where he proved local existence in time and uniqueness ( in @xmath8 with @xmath3 for any initial data in @xcite ) and global existence for initial data sufficiently close to equilibrium in @xcite .",
    "an other direction of research is the flow of a fluid down an inclined plane on which teramoto proved the local in time unique solvability in 3d without surface tension in @xcite and with surface tension in @xcite .",
    "nishida , teramoto and win @xcite proved the global in time unique existence in a periodic 2d domain and with sufficiently small initial data",
    ". in @xcite , bresch and noble derived a shallow water model and obtained estimates @xmath9 ( still for a periodic in @xmath10 flow ) . + here , we investigate an other direction in which we must quote the pioneer article of beale in 1981 who proved existence and uniqueness in small time in 3d without surface tension in @xcite , using sobolev - slobodetski spaces .",
    "he also proved in @xcite the global existence for sufficiently small initial data , thanks to gravity _ and _ surface tension .",
    "fujita - yashima proved in 1985 the existence of a stationnary and a time - periodic solution in the same geometry with surface tension in @xcite by perturbation methods . allain adapted the articles of beale to the 2d geometry with surface tension .",
    "she proved well - posedness in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "sylvester had large time existence even without surface tension .",
    "tani extended these results to the 3d case in @xcite . in a joint article with tanaka",
    ", he gave a proof of large time existence for sufficiently small initial data whether there is surface tension or not in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , abels generalized these results to the @xmath11 spaces ( @xmath12 ) in 2 or 3 dimensions ( the velocity is in @xmath13 ) . in @xcite , tanaka and tani proved in 2003 the local existence for arbitrary initial data and global existence for sufficiently small initial data of a compressible navier - stokes flow with heat and surface tension taken into account .",
    "recent articles were published on the numerical resolution of the latter problem especially in view of the simulation of surface waves .",
    "we may quote gutirrez and bermejo @xcite , audusse et al .",
    "@xcite , guidorzi and padula @xcite and in 2009 fang et al .",
    "our main result is the well - posedness of the equations of a viscoelastic fluid with a free boundary for arbitrary large initial data sufficiently regular .",
    "most of the results of the present article are announced in @xcite and extend those of the author s phd thesis @xcite .    up to some minor modifications",
    ", more complex constitutive laws can be dealt with .",
    "basically , it relies on the fact that the constitutive law improves the regularity of its source term which is the velocity gradient .",
    "the nonlinear terms are easy to handle because of an algebra property .",
    "so , provided one may have estimates of the extra stress in an algebra , the same theorem applies to more general viscoelastic fluids .",
    "below , we give the eulerian ( subsection 2.1 ) , and then lagrangian equations ( subsection 2.2 ) . the equations given , we set the spaces and operators to be inverted and give the sketch of the proof ( subsection 2.3 ) .",
    "section 3 is devoted to solving an auxiliary problem which proof is sketched in subsection 3.1 . then , one solves a second nonlinear auxiliary problem specific to the viscoelastic fluids in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to estimates of the error terms and we use all the preceding results in a fixed point in section 6 .",
    "starting from the dimensionless equations in eulerian coordinates ( subsection 2.1 ) , we derive the dimensionless equations in lagrangian coordinates ( subsection 2.2 ) , state the operators , spaces and give the sketch of the proof ( subsection 2.3 ) .",

    "+ we can no more take off the @xmath606 term by a simple @xmath607 bound .",

    "then a simple decomposition of @xmath612 enables to have a @xmath613 term not initially vanishing but linear , and a @xmath614 term which is nonlinear but initially vanishing :    @xmath615    the difference with the estimate in @xmath598 is that the equivalent term was @xmath616 .",
    "such a term could be bounded by @xmath617 with a constant equal to 1 .",
    "but here we need to use lemma [ gacinqquatre ] and especially its _ ( ii ) _ because we need constants independent of @xmath532 .",
    "so we split @xmath618 , use the fact that @xmath619 ( costless ) and that @xmath327 , so that @xmath620 can be extended without any loss to @xmath621 . in summary , we have proved the following bound :    @xmath622 \\mid_{h^{\\frac{r}{2}}(0,t;l^2 ) } & \\leq & c t^{\\epsilon'}. \\end{array}\\ ] ]    the other terms are no more difficult .",
    "so ( [ est1 ] ) is established for @xmath590 .",
    "the argument that @xmath623 is initially vanishing and so that the embedding of @xmath624 in @xmath607 has a constant independent of @xmath317 is not in p. 380 of @xcite .",
    "we only added this and lemmas [ lemma57 ] and [ lemma58 ] to complete the proof .",
    "one could prove in the same way that @xmath590 is lipschitz and so satisfies ( [ est2 ] ) .",
    "we consider now the error terms of the constitutive equation in @xmath626 :    @xmath627    in order to treat the first term in @xmath188 , we split @xmath188 in @xmath280 and @xmath628 .",
    "we apply lemma [ hervecinqneuf ] , lemma [ lemma5.6.5 ] and lemma [ lemma57 ] to the first term in @xmath280 :    @xmath629    where @xmath630 is defined in ( [ def_aprime ] ) .",
    "one may also bound the first term in @xmath631 .",
    "indeed , lemma [ gacinqsept ] and lemma [ lemma58 ] enable to write :    @xmath632    with @xmath205 depending on @xmath633 , but not on @xmath166 .",
    "so we proved :    @xmath634    in order to treat the second term , the algebra properties of @xmath635 give :    @xmath636    thanks to lemma [ hervecinqneuf ] . + in order to prove the contracting property , we compute the difference :    @xmath637    every term can be managed in the same way as before by using ( [ est2.625 ] ) and not ( [ est2.5 ] ) of lemma [ gacinqsept ] , lemma [ lemma5.6.5 ] , lemma [ lemma57 ] and lemma [ lemma58 ] .",
    "this operator comes almost only from the navier - stokes part .",
    "this part has been estimated by g. allain @xcite for a newtonian fluid .",
    "so we only have to estimate the terms @xmath638 in @xmath639 .",
    "we will estimate separately @xmath640 and @xmath641 .",
    "concerning @xmath640 , as for lemma [ hervecinqneuf ] , we have :    @xmath642 thanks to lemma [ gacinqquatre ] @xmath511 .",
    "so @xmath640 is bounded in @xmath643 by a constant independent of @xmath157 .",
    "concerning @xmath641 , we use the following formula : @xmath644 the estimate of @xmath641 is done in the algebra @xmath645 so as to conclude . since @xmath646 , lemmas [ gacinqdeux ] and [ hervecinqneuf ] apply and also classical theorems found in @xcite :    @xmath647    thanks to the fact that @xmath648 , the term satisfies :    @xmath649    the contracting property of this operator is proved in the same way .",
    "+ this completes the proof of theorem [ estimationserreurs ]",
    "we want to solve the lagrangian nonlinear system ( [ eq14 ] ) associated to the operator @xmath429 .",
    "let us remind the reader with the expansion done in the first section :    @xmath650    where @xmath651 contains all the zeroth order terms ( gravity and initial surface tension ) .",
    "+ first we lift the initial conditions and the zeroth order terms . to that end , we use theorem [ thlineaire ] that states that @xmath120 is invertible from @xmath295 to @xmath168 : @xmath115 with continuous dependence on the initial conditions .",
    "so let @xmath512 be such that : @xmath652 which is allowed thanks to the fact that the right - hand side is in @xmath653 ( @xmath654 implies that @xmath655 ) .    if we perform a change of variable for the unknown fields ( @xmath592 replaces @xmath55 and so on ) , we are led to find @xmath656 such that :    @xmath657({{\\bf u}},q,\\phi,{\\boldsymbol \\sigma})=-e({\\boldsymbol \\xi}({{\\bf u}}_1+{{\\bf u}}),{{\\bf u}}_1+{{\\bf u}},q_1+q,\\phi_1+\\phi,{\\boldsymbol \\sigma}_1+{\\boldsymbol \\sigma } ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath123 is the second auxiliary problem introduced above in ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath154 $ ] is invertible when the rhs is in @xmath168 thanks to theorem [ resolp2_simplifie ] , we want to solve    @xmath658(-e({\\boldsymbol \\xi}({{\\bf u}}_1+{{\\bf u}}),{{\\bf u}}_1+{{\\bf u}},q_1+q,\\phi_1+\\phi,{\\boldsymbol \\sigma}_1+{\\boldsymbol \\sigma } ) ) \\\\   & : = & f({{\\bf u}},q,\\phi,{\\boldsymbol \\sigma } ) . \\end{array}\\ ] ]    at that level , g. allain proves in @xcite for a newtonian fluid that her @xmath162 lets an invariant ball .",
    "but since we use a contraction mapping , we do not need this .",
    "we need now to prove that @xmath162 is contracting .",
    "thanks to lemma [ gacinqsept ] and especially ( [ est2 ] ) :    @xmath659    where @xmath205 depends on the parameters , and also on the functions that lift the intial conditions , but only through a bound of their norm . as before , it does not depend on @xmath157 , so we have proved that for @xmath449 sufficiently small , @xmath162 is contracting .",
    "we may apply the contraction mapping principle which provides a solution to the lagrangian system of equations ( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "owing to the regularity of the lagrangian velocity @xmath55 , one has solved also the eulerian equations ( [ eq7 ] ) by a simple change of variables .",
    "thanks to the contraction property , uniqueness is obvious .",
    "last the solution depends on the initial conditions directly in a continuous way and indirectly through the lift functions also continuously .",
    "the proof of our main theorem [ theor2 ] is complete .",
    "the proof of our main theorem is written for the specific constitutive law of oldroyd . in order to convince the reader that it can include most reasonnable constitutive laws , we study successively various models well - known in the literature .",
    "we could even treat a new model of an elastoviscoplastic fluid @xcite , but it would require deeper modifications of the proof .",
    "the most crucial step in the proof is the first one : when we prove uniform ( in @xmath217 and @xmath1 ) estimate on @xmath314 .",
    "then , using this estimate , it is easy to derive the same inequalities as ours until the conclusion .",
