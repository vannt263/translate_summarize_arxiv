    "one of the fundamental properties of disordered conductors that has been studied extensively the past 20 years is the phase coherence time of the conduction electrons . at temperatures below about 1 k , the dominant phase - breaking mechanism in nonmagnetic disordered metals",
    "is predicted to be electron - electron scattering.@xcite the corresponding phase - breaking rate decreases as the temperature is lowered as a power law , @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 , where @xmath4 depends on the effective dimensionality of the system .",
    "recent experiments and analysis of several older experiments@xcite show that the phase coherence time in some samples tends to saturate at a finite temperature , in contrast with theoretical expectations .",
    "a second consequence of electron - electron scattering is energy exchange between quasiparticles .",
    "recently , experiments have been performed which provide information on the energy dependence , as well as the overall rate , of energy exchange in mesoscopic wires driven out of equilibrium by a current.@xcite those experiments showed that the energy relaxation rate in cu wires was larger than predicted by theory , and the energy dependence of the scattering rate was different from that predicted .",
    "the purpose of the present work is twofold .",
    "first , we aim to shed light on the issue of saturation of the phase coherence time , by measuring the temperature dependence of @xmath0 in wires of several different metals .",
    "second , we compare our results with those from the energy relaxation experiments , to see if energy and phase relaxation are related in similarly prepared samples .",
    "energy relaxation experiments have now been performed on wires of ag @xcite and au@xcite in addition to the original work on cu . for purposes of comparison ,",
    "we have therefore studied phase coherence in cu , ag , and au wires .",
    "the wires used in our experiment were deposited on similar substrates , and in the same electron - gun evaporator used to fabricate samples for the energy relaxation experiments.@xcite the wires were patterned using e - beam lithography and the lift - off process .",
    "sample dimensions are given in table i. the three samples have very similar resistivity @xmath5 , as deduced from the resistance @xmath6 , length @xmath7 , width @xmath8 and thickness @xmath9 .",
    "the diffusion constants @xmath10 were deduced from @xmath5 using einstein s relation .",
    "the only difference in the fabrication procedure for these three samples is that the au sample was deposited on top of a thin ( 1 nm ) layer of al to improve adhesion to the substrate .",
    "sample widths vary from 65 to 110 nm , hence all the samples are quasi one - dimensional with respect to the phase - breaking length , @xmath11 and the thermal length , @xmath12 over the temperature range studied .",
    "the samples were immersed in the dilute phase of the @xmath13he-@xmath14he mixture of a dilution refrigerator .",
    "electrical lines to the sample were filtered at the top of the cryostat and again near the sample .",
    "resistance measurements were performed using a standard ac four - terminal technique with a lock - in amplifier .",
    "a ratio transformer was used in a bridge circuit to enhance the measurement sensitivity to small changes in sample resistance .",
    "figure 1 shows the magnetoresistance of the ag sample at several temperatures . at low temperature ,",
    "the magnetoresistance is positive , indicating that the spin - orbit scattering length @xmath15 is shorter than @xmath16 .",
    "figure 1 shows that the magnitude of the weak localization contribution to the magnetoresistance continues to increase down to the lowest temperatures measured .",
    "figure 2 shows similar raw data for the cu sample .",
    "in contrast to the ag data , the magnitude of the magnetoresistance does not continue to grow at low temperature , but saturates at about 1 k in the cu sample .",
    "[ table i ]    * table i *    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]             the magnetoresistance is very small in the au sample , indicating that @xmath16 is very short .",
    "in fact , the poor signal - to - noise ratio of the au data prevented us from obtaining reliable data at temperatures below 1 k. the data we were able to obtain indicate that @xmath16 had already saturated at 6 k.",
    "to obtain estimates of @xmath16 and hence @xmath0 , we fit our data to the weak localization expression for the magnetoresistance in 1d:@xcite @xmath17^{-1/2 } \\right . \\\\",
    "\\nonumber &   & \\left .",
    "-{{1 } \\over { 2 } } \\left[{{1 } \\over { l_\\phi ^2 } } +   { { 1 } \\over { 3}}\\left({{wbe } \\over { \\hbar}}\\right)^2\\right]^{-1/2 } \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have omitted terms that describe spin - flip scattering by magnetic impurities .",
    "reliable determination of @xmath18 from the fit is only possible at the higher temperatures shown , where the magnetoresistance changes slope at high fields . at lower temperatures",
    ", we fix the value of @xmath18 and fit to the single free parameter @xmath16 .",
    "echternach et al.@xcite have emphasized that eq .",
    "( 1 ) is not strictly valid at temperatures where the dominant phase - breaking mechanism is electron - electron scattering with small energy transfer , also called nyquist scattering.@xcite in that low - temperature limit , phase differences accumulate slowly over many collisions , hence dephasing is not an exponential process .",
    "we refer the reader to ref . 9 for a complete discussion of this issue . here",
    "it suffices to say that experimental data does not allow one to distinguish between the correct magnetoresistance formula in the nyquist regime and eq .",
    "the reason is that the function that enters in the nyquist regime , @xmath19 with @xmath20 the airy function , is well approximated for all @xmath21 by @xmath22 , with corrections of at most 4% .",
    "use of this approximation in the correct magnetoresistance formula@xcite results in eq .",
    "( 1 ) with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the nyquist dephasing rate and @xmath25 is the dephasing rate due to electron - phonon scattering and any other mechanisms .",
    "realistically , @xmath26 defined in this way is the only time accessible to experiment .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath0 versus temperature for our three samples .",
    "the differences , already apparent in the raw data , are striking . in the ag sample",
    ", @xmath0 continues to increase down to the lowest temperatures measured . in the cu sample",
    ", @xmath0 saturates below 1 k at a value of 2 ns , while in the au sample , @xmath0 saturates already at 6 k at a value of 10 ps .    ) , cu(@xmath27 ) and au(@xmath28 ) samples as a function of temperature .",
    "the solid line is a fit of the ag data to eq .",
    "( 2).,width=307,height=403 ]    the theory of electron - electron scattering in disordered conductors predicts that @xmath0 should increase as a power law as the temperature is lowered . for the 1d case ,",
    "the predicted behavior in the nyquist regime@xcite is @xmath29 . to see",
    "if our ag data is consistent with this prediction , we have fit the temperature dependence of @xmath0 to the functional form : @xmath30 where the second term is meant to describe electron - phonon scattering at higher temperatures.@xcite the best values of the three fit parameters are @xmath4=0.61 , @xmath31=0.7 ns@xmath32k@xmath33 , and @xmath34=55 @xmath35s@xmath32k@xmath36 , compared to the theoretical predictions @xmath4=2/3 , @xmath31=0.6 ns@xmath32k@xmath37 .",
    "thus the ag data are in agreement with the theory of nyquist dephasing in both the overall magnitude and temperature dependence.@xcite these results are consistent with those of wind et al .",
    "@xcite , who measured both the magnitude and width dependence of the nyquist dephasing rate in ag and al wires above 2 k , and with those of echternach and al .",
    "@xcite , who found agreement with theory for the dephasing rate of au samples down to 100 mk .",
    "our results thus extend by a factor of two lower temperature the experimental confirmation of the nyquist scattering theory",
    ".    what conclusions can we draw from these results ?",
    "first , our ag data contradict the recent experimental claim that saturation of @xmath0 is universal in disordered metal wires.@xcite the proposed theoretical expression for the maximum value of @xmath0 presented in that paper gives a result @xmath38 ns for our ag sample , about 5 times shorter than what we observe at our lowest temperature .",
    "second , since the macroscopic parameters ( physical dimensions and resistivity ) of our three samples are nearly identical , theoretical model that predicts a maximum value of @xmath0 based on those parameters alone must be incorrect.@xcite our work thus lends experimental support to recent theoretical papers@xcite refuting the claim that saturation of @xmath0 is universal . on the other hand ,",
    "our cu and au data show that samples do show saturation of @xmath0 .",
    "since all three of our samples were measured in the same cryostat under the same conditions , it is unlikely that the saturation is due to interference from external electromagnetic radiation , as was recently proposed.@xcite the cause of the saturation is not yet known , but we will mention some recent proposals at the conclusion of this paper . the small value of @xmath0 in our au sample is curious , when compared with data from other workers.@xcite further measurements on other samples will reveal whether the al underlayer has any influence on the dephasing rate .",
    "we now compare these results with those from the energy relaxation experiments . @xcite",
    "the analysis of those experiments was performed within the framework of the quantum boltzmann equation.@xcite the results of the analysis were expressed in terms of a kernel function , @xmath39 , which describes the scattering rate between quasiparticles as a function of the energy @xmath40 exchanged in the interaction . in the appendix , we present a heuristic argument relating @xmath39 to the dephasing rate @xmath41 .",
    "the main result of that calculation is that if @xmath42 with @xmath43 , then the dephasing rate should have the temperature dependence @xmath44 . starting with ag , pierre et al.@xcite",
    "have found that with @xmath45 in some samples , and @xmath46 in others .",
    "the former result is in agreement with the theory of electron - electron interactions,@xcite and is consistent with our observation that @xmath47 at low temperatures .",
    "furthermore , the prefactor in @xmath39 is close to the theoretical prediction , consistent with our similar observation for the dephasing rate . in cu and",
    "au , the situation is more subtle .",
    "the original energy relaxation experiments@xcite in cu found @xmath48 , with @xmath49 ns . the characteristic scattering time of @xmath50 ns is very close to the dephasing time we observe at low temperature , but the energy dependence of @xmath51 is not consistent with our observation of @xmath0 saturation . according to the derivation given in the appendix ,",
    "@xmath52 should lead to @xmath53 . in au ,",
    "the situation is similar .",
    "the energy relaxation experiments@xcite find @xmath48 , with @xmath54 ps , whereas we observe saturation of @xmath0 at 10 ps .",
    "we note that the au samples used in the energy relaxation experiment did not have the thin al underlayer .",
    "the fact that the energy dependence of @xmath51 deduced from the energy relaxation experiments in cu and au is not consistent with the observed temperature dependence of @xmath0 may simply be telling us that electron - electron collisions are not responsible for one or both of those observations .",
    "the analysis of the energy relaxation experiments assumes that two - body electron - electron collisions are the dominant energy exchange process in the sample .",
    "the relation between @xmath51 and @xmath0 presented in the appendix assumes the same for dephasing . since the results of neither",
    "experiment agree with the theoretical prediction for electron - electron scattering , it is perhaps not surprising that our comparison of the results from within that framework leads to a contradiction .",
    "what then is the cause of the saturation of @xmath0 we observe in our cu and au samples ?",
    "it was already argued by mohanty et al . that magnetic impurities are unlikely to be the cause of the saturation , since samples with magnetic impurities deliberately added do not exhibit a saturation of the dephasing rate.@xcite our results support that conclusion .",
    "although it is well known that magnetic impurities can lead to dephasing via spin - flip scattering , it seems unlikely that they could provide an efficient mechanism of energy exchange in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "there have been recent suggestions that two - level systems may be responsible.@xcite one of those proposals@xcite relates the dephasing rate to the level of @xmath55 noise in the sample at frequencies close to @xmath1 .",
    "that proposal relies on assumptions about the distribution of tunneling centers in disordered metals that have not been directly tested by experiment .",
    "the second proposal invokes two - level systems with nearly degenerate ground states , which act as two - channel kondo impurities.@xcite it is argued that such systems can lead to a temperature - independent dephasing rate over a limited temperature range , below which the rate must tend to zero .",
    "it remains to be seen if either of these ideas can explain the intriguing results regarding both phase and energy relaxation in metal wires .",
    "we are grateful to m. devoret and y. imry for valuable discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsf grant dmr-9801841 .",
    "travel between saclay and east lansing was supported by nato , under collaborative research grant 970273 .",
    "to facilitate comparison of the energy relaxation and phase relaxation experiments , we present a heuristic derivation of the dephasing rate one obtains from a given @xmath39.@xcite the out - scattering term in the boltzmann equation takes the form : @xmath56f(e')[1-f({\\varepsilon}+e')]}\\ ] ] where we have suppressed all reference to spatial variables .",
    "we assume that the dephasing rate at temperature @xmath57 is equal to the out - scattering rate with the initial state occupied and with equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution functions @xmath58 . within the framework of eq .",
    "( 3 ) , it makes no sense to include scattering events with energy transfer less than the dephasing rate itself , hence we set the lower limit of the integral to @xmath59.@xcite the upper limit is cut off at @xmath60 by the availability of unoccupied final states .",
    "we then have :              if @xmath66 with @xmath43 , then the integral is dominated by the low - energy limit , and the dephasing rate has the temperature dependence @xmath67 . for the case of disordered metals of dimension",
    "d , the theoretical prediction@xcite is @xmath68 . in 1d",
    ", this leads to the well - known result@xcite @xmath69 .",
    "we note here some possible limitations of the approach taken above .",
    "most notably , eq .  ( 4 ) indicates that dephasing occurs by single scattering events with energy transfer greater than @xmath70 .",
    "this is in contrast with the discussion given in the original theoretical papers,@xcite where dephasing is described by a process of gradual accumulation of phase during many collisions with energy transfer @xmath71 .",
    "second , the approach shown here does not address subtle differences between dephasing rates measured in different experiments .",
    "recently it has been shown both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite that the dephasing rate measured in weak localization experiments is different from that measured in universal conductance fluctuation experiments .",
    "nevertheless , we find it remarkable that the simple argument outlined above gives the correct temperature dependence of the dephasing rate from the energy dependence of @xmath39 .",
