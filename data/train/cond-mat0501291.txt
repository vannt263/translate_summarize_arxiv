    "since its introduction in the early 1920-ies the ising model serves as a paradigm to study criticality of interacting many - particle systems where the single particle can be in two possible states .",
    "such a general problem statement supported in the 1960-ies by the universality and scaling hypothesis led to the present situation , when the ising model is used to explain criticality and scaling in such different fields as ferromagnetism and binary mixtures from the one side or networks and text series from the other side .",
    "subsequently , the random - site ising model is of primary importance to understand the influence of the structural disorder on criticality . and this explains a lot of theoretical , experimental and computational efforts invested so far to shed light on the phenomena happening there .",
    "in particular , the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ising model subject to a weak dilution by non - magnetic impurities changes its universality class @xcite .",
    "already this phenomena called for its explanation and verification .",
    "we address the reader to recent reviews @xcite where theoretical , experimental and computational data is collected and compared . in our study , we use the monte carlo ( mc ) approach and address the comparison of three different simulational techniques analysing critical behaviour of the 3d quenched diluted ising model .",
    "some of the outcome is obvious , but we think it is instructive to perform such simulations now , when certain mc tools are sometimes discarded for not obvious reasons",
    ". moreover , a part of our simulations concerns the critical amplitude ratios of the 3d random - site ising model  a question which was not intensively analysed so far , and where a disagreement between the mc and theoretical predictions exists .",
    "it is our big pleasure and honour to contribute this paper to the festschrift devoted to reinhard folk s 60th birthday : his contribution to the theory of phase transitions in general and to the problem we consider here is hard to be overestimated .",
    "the hamiltonian of the random - site ising model has the following form @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the summation over the nearest neighbour sites of 3d simple cubic lattice , @xmath4 is the interaction constant , @xmath5 if the @xmath6-th site is occupied by spin and @xmath7 otherwise , the ising spins @xmath8 take two values @xmath9",
    ". occupied sites ( @xmath5 ) are considered to be randomly distributed and quenched in a fixed configuration . for every observable , discussed below , first the boltzmann average with respect to the spin subsystem is performed for the fixed site configuration , subsequently the averaging over different disorder realisations ( configurational average ) is performed .",
    "we will use the following notations , the number of all sites is @xmath10 and the number of sites carrying a spin is @xmath11 .",
    "the concentration of spins is defined therefore as @xmath12 .",
    "several separate sets of simulations are performed in this study with the aim to investigate different characteristics of the model . in all the simulations",
    "the concentration of spins was taken fixed and equal to @xmath13 . for the 3d random site ising model , at spin concentration @xmath14 the correction - to - scaling terms appear to be particularly small @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the concentration chosen we do not take these terms into account in our further analysis .",
    "the simulations were performed on a set of following lattice sizes @xmath15 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the other details , particularly the number of disorder realisations , the simulation lengths and the algorithms employed have been chosen depending on the aim of particular simulation set .",
    "the aim of the first set of simulations is to estimate the critical temperature of the model at different @xmath16 . due to the finite - size scaling theory @xcite , the finite system of linear size",
    "@xmath16 will demonstrate an evidence of a critical behaviour at a certain temperature @xmath17 which differs from the critical temperature of the infinite system @xmath18 @xcite @xmath19 where the correction - to - scaling terms have been omitted . to find @xmath17",
    "the following procedure was followed .",
    "the initial configuration was prepared by scattering diluted sites randomly on the lattice and the original orientations of spins were chosen randomly .",
    "first , the runs on the smallest lattice size @xmath20 were performed on @xmath21 disorder realisations during @xmath22 mc sweeps using metropolis algorithm @xcite .",
    "the preliminary estimate for the critical temperature was taken from the mean - field approximation : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the critical temperature of the pure 3d ising model @xcite . during the simulations the histograms for the potential energy ( [ ham ] ) and for the absolute value of the order parameter @xmath25",
    "were built and then , using the histogram reweighting technique @xcite , the temperature region around @xmath26 was explored . for a given disorder realization ,",
    "the susceptibility was evaluated according to the fluctuational relation @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes boltzmann averaging and @xmath29 is the dimensionless coupling .",
    "the temperatures where @xmath30 has a maximal value were then averaged over all disorder realisations ( hereafter , such configurational averaging will be denoted by @xmath31 ) and used as the working estimate for the critical temperature @xmath32 for @xmath20 .",
    "this temperature was also used as the preliminary estimate for the critical temperature for the next lattice size @xmath33 . again , for @xmath33 we performed short runs on @xmath21 disorder realisations during @xmath34 mc sweeps .",
    "this provides us with the working estimate for the critical temperature for @xmath33 , @xmath35 .",
    "the process is continued until all the lattice sizes are processed .",
    "the temperatures @xmath32 obtained in this way have been used for the final simulations of @xmath36 disorder realisations from which all the main results are driven .",
    "it is to note here that one has different possibilities to define the critical temperature of a finite - size system .",
    "along with the definition used in this study , one can define @xmath17 as the temperature where the configurational average of @xmath30 has its maximum .",
    "however the same value of @xmath37 is expected in the thermodynamic limit and the same scaling behaviour holds when approaching this limit .",
    "the large clusters of correlated spins exist in the vicinity of the critical point , that in turn leads to the effect of critical slowing down @xcite . as the result , the relaxation time of the system increases dramatically .",
    "one can estimate the typical relaxation time during the simulation by observing the ( configurationally dependent ) autocorrelation function @xcite for the potential energy ( or , alternatively , for some other characteristic of the system ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the instant value for the energy at some effective time @xmath40 ( in mc simulations @xmath40 is measured in mc sweeps ) and @xmath41 is some time origin .",
    "the @xmath42 is averaged over different time origins in a course of simulations . at times large enough",
    "@xmath43 decays exponentially according to debye law @xmath44 more details can be found elsewhere @xcite . in ( [ taue ] )",
    "@xmath45 has a meaning of the characteristic autocorrelation time for a given disorder realisation .",
    "besides the influence on critical dynamics ( which is beyond the scope of this study ) , the critical slowing down has also some practical implications .",
    "firstly , the estimate of @xmath45 is vital for determination of the required length of the simulation .",
    "only the configurations separated by a number of mc sweeps of order @xmath45 can be considered as statistically independent , and the required length of the simulation run should be measured in @xmath45 scale but not in mc sweeps @xcite .",
    "secondly , the critical slowing down leads in metropolis ( or other local dynamics ) algorithms to a dramatic increase of @xmath45 .",
    "this is , of course , due to a high energy penalty required to flip a single spin ( or pair of spins ) in a cluster of uniformly oriented neighbours . to overcome this problem ,",
    "a number of cluster algorithms with non - local dynamics have been suggested , with the swendsen - wang @xcite and wolff @xcite ones being most commonly used .",
    "the second set of our simulations is targeting upon the detailed comparison of autocorrelation times and of the efficiency of different mc algorithms at a number of lattice sizes @xmath16 for the model under consideration . to this end",
    "we performed the simulations of 10 - 15 disorder realizations for each @xmath16 at the temperatures @xmath32 .",
    "we used three different algorithms , the metropolis , swendsen - wang and wolff ones .",
    "the simulation length was fixed to @xmath46 for all cases .",
    "for each given disorder realisation the value of @xmath45 has been evaluated according to ( [ taue ] ) .",
    "these values were averaged then over all disorder realisations .",
    "the results for the average autocorrelation time @xmath47 are presented in tab .  1 .",
    "the relaxation times are given in mc sweeps , where one sweep corresponds to refreshing of each spin .",
    "this means , that for the wolff algorithm we followed the standard procedure of the autocorrelation time normalisation taking into account the average cluster size @xcite .",
    "one can see the different rate of pseudodynamics for all three algorithms used and the autocorrelation time @xmath47 can be seen as a measure of the minimal number of mc sweeps separating two adjacent uncorrelated configurations . however , all three algorithms differ significantly on a time spent for one mc sweep and we will be more interested in the time required to generate the next uncorrelated configuration",
    ". this will reflect the true speed of each algorithm .",
    "the latter can be estimated from an inverse time @xmath48 spent on @xmath49 mc sweeps and taking into account that only @xmath50 of these are uncorrelated @xmath51    .the energy autocorrelation time @xmath47 for different lattice sizes @xmath16 measured in mc sweeps ( see the text for details ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the average of all the three results for the index @xmath52 shown in tab .",
    "2 yields @xmath53 obtained value for @xmath52 distingtly differs from the theoretical estimate of the corresponding exponent of the pure 3d ising model : @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "however it is less than the asymptotic value of @xmath52 for the random 3d ising model as obtained by the field - theoretical rg approach @xmath55 @xcite and by the mc simulations @xmath56 @xcite , @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "this is an evidence of the fact that for the spin concentrations and lattice sizes chosen here the system still crosses over to the asymptotic regime .",
    "note , that close estimates for @xmath52 were found at similar system parameters ( and neglecting correction - to - scaling terms ) in the mc simulation of the random site 3d ising model : @xmath58 @xcite ; as well as of the random bond 3d ising model : @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the standard finite - size scaling concepts have been also employed for the evaluation of the other critical indices , particularly these for the susceptibility @xmath60 and for the magnetisation @xmath61 . due to this scheme @xcite for finite size system of dimension @xmath16 in the critical region one has @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are",

    "@xmath65 is the averaged maximum value for the susceptibility that is achieved at some temperature and @xmath66 is the averaged value of the magnetisation at the same temperature .",
    "we employed the following scheme . for each disorder realisation",
    "the temperature @xmath67 was found where the @xmath30 achieves its maximal value @xmath68",
    ". then the magnetisation @xmath69 is evaluated at the same @xmath67 .",
    "afterwards , the values of @xmath68 and @xmath70 have been averaged over all disorder realisations to be used for fitting the relations ( [ chim ] ) .",
    "the results of fittings are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig3],[fig4 ] in a form of the log - log plots for the @xmath71 and for @xmath72 vs @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "one should note near perfect linear fits achieved in both cases , leading to the following results for @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xmath73 for the reasons explained above , taking exponent @xmath52 as an example , the values ( [ gam])-([beta ] ) slightly differ from their asymptotic counterparts @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "they are in a good agreement with the exponents of the 3d ising model with random bond dilution : @xmath75 @xcite giving one more proof that both models belong to the same universality class .    with the value for the critical index @xmath52 being evaluated in ( [ resultnu ] ) one",
    "can obtain the estimate for the critical temperature for the infinite system @xmath18 .",
    "it is related to the critical temperatures of the finite system of linear dimension @xmath16 , @xmath17 , via the relation ( [ tc ] ) .",
    "the values for @xmath17 were estimated during the same set of simulations that have been used for the evaluation of critical indices . for each disorder realisation",
    "we found the sets of temperatures @xmath76 where the maximum values for the susceptibility ( for the @xmath77 case ) and for the derivatives ( [ maxval])-([logmsq ] ) ( the cases @xmath78 , respectively ) are achieved .",
    "the data sets @xmath76 should be plotted then vs the scaled system size @xmath79 and , ideally , for all @xmath6 should extrapolate at @xmath80 to the same value of @xmath18 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] where we used the data for all the lattice sizes from @xmath20 to @xmath81 . as the result of the extrapolation procedure",

    "can be found as an average on all four numbers in eq.([tinfty ] ) @xmath84    as it is clear already from simple mean - field arguments ( see eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) our estimate for @xmath37 made for the spin concentration @xmath85 should lay in between corresponding data for @xmath86 and @xmath87 . indeed ,",
    "the most recent estimates read : @xmath88 ; @xmath89 @xcite , @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "in this study we have calculated the universal ratio @xmath0 for the magnetic susceptibility in the critical region @xmath91 the singularity of the susceptibility ( [ chipm ] ) is observed for the infinite system only , at finite system size @xmath16 it is rounded - off with the finite maximum value . at each given system size @xmath16",
    "there will be only a finite temperature interval where the susceptibility curve overlaps with that for the infinite system .",
    "as @xmath92 approaches the @xmath18 the finite - size curve deviates from the infinite one . as the result , each estimate for the critical amplitudes made at different system sizes will be valid in certain temperature range .",
    "the other complication for the disordered systems is the presence of some distribution of @xmath30 curves obtained for different disorder realisations ( the example for the system size @xmath93 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "we employed the following method for the evaluation of critical amplitudes @xmath94 and @xmath95 . the critical temperature for the infinite system @xmath18 was taken as the central one and then the grid of temperatures around it was considered .",
    "the gridness was chosen to be even in scaled temperature units @xmath96 , where @xmath97 . at each grid temperature the separate simulation of @xmath21 disorder realisations",
    "was performed of the length @xmath98 and the value for the susceptibility was evaluated .",
    "one could , in principle , use the histogram reweighting technique to evaluate the intermediate temperatures as well , but this will require the study of histograms validity . in this calculation we opted for more straightforward approach using the separate simulation runs and havent employed histogram reweighting .",
    "the values for the critical amplitudes @xmath94 and @xmath95 can be obtained by plotting the scaled susceptibility @xmath99 .",
    "the data are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] and for the evaluation of the ratio @xmath0 the data points with @xmath100 have been ignored , since they are in the fss regime .",
    "this gives the following value for the amplitudes ratio @xmath101 it compares very well with the recent result @xmath102 @xcite obtained by mc simulations of bond - diluted ising model at bond dilution @xmath103 .",
    "the theoretical prediction obtained by the field - theoretical renormalization group calculations in three - loop approximation reads : @xmath104 @xcite . as a reason of the discrepancy between estimates ( [ amp ] ) , @xcite and",
    "@xcite one can mention the shortness and bad convergence of the series for @xmath0 , as recognized already in @xcite .",
    "however further analysis is required to get a definite answer . in any case , both theoretical and mc estimates of the critical amplitudes ratio certainly differ from those of the pure 3d ising model : @xmath105 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in this study we performed computer simulations of the 3d ising model with random site dilution in critical region . despite the number of simulational studies of this model being already performed , some aspects of its critical behaviour and simulational details are still awaiting for more detailed analysis .",
    "one of these to mention is the applicability and the effectiveness of different monte carlo algorithms , the topic being studied previously for the pure models mainly .",
    "however in the case of disordered models the impurities may have a profound effect on system clusterisation which , in turn , is exploited in cluster methods .",
    "we examined the most commonly used metropolis , swendsen - wang and wolff algorithms and evaluated both the energy autocorrelation times and the respective speed of algorithms in generating statistically independent configurations .",
    "we found that for the linear lattice sizes up to @xmath106 the wolff algorithm is more preferable to use and hence it was applied in our study .",

    "the critical indices have been calculated . in this way we complemented the existing results .",
