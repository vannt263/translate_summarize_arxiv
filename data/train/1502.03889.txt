    "the background - subtracted uv light curve of psr  j2129 - 0429  was automatically extracted by the xmmsas tool _ omfchain_. after barycentric correction , we folded the uv light curve at the orbital period of psr  j2129 - 0429  with phase zero defined at the same epoch for the x - ray light curve .",

    "lat data collected between 4 august 2008 and 17 december 2014 .",
    "we modeled 2fgl  j2129.8 - 0428 with a simple power law @xmath86 and a power law with exponential cutoff @xmath87    the fit with a simple power law gives @xmath88 and @xmath89 photons @xmath31 s@xmath12 above 100  mev , and a test - statistic ( ts ; mattox et al .",

    "the power - law spectrumis consistent with that reported in the 2fgl catalog ( nolan et al . , 2012 ) .",
    "although the reported 2fgl spectrum is not significantly curved , we also fit 2fgl  j2129.8 - 0428 using a power law with exponential cutoff ( ple ) .",

    "the likelihood ratio test gives @xmath93likelihood@xmath94 ; therefore the ple model is preferred over the pl model at a statistical significance of @xmath95 .",
    "we also constructed a long - term light curve with 3-month bins , and did not find significant step - like flux change like the one observed for psr  j1023 + 0038 in july 2012 when the latter changed from a radio msp phase to a lmxb phase ( e.g. takata , et al . , 2014 ) .",
    "we further examine for possible gamma - ray orbital modulation using @xmath96 gev photons obtained with fermi observations over 6 years ( 4 august 2008 to 11 november 2014 ) .",
    "about 2860 counts were obtained in a circular region of @xmath97 around 2fgl j2129.8 - 0428 . with the same phase zero adopted in x - ray and optical investigations , the probability to randomly obtain a gamma - ray signal at least as significant as the one we obtained at the orbital period determined from optical observations , is 0.011 and 0.1 inspected through @xmath98 statistics ( @xmath99 ) and @xmath100 test ( @xmath100=33.1 in 24 d.o.f . ) , respectively .",
    "so , we conclude no significant orbital modulation is detected in the gamma - ray band .",
    "the lack of orbital modulation does not support the shock origin of gamma - rays .",
    "a spectral cutoff at several gev has been found from many gamma - ray msps ( e.g. , abdo et al . 2009 ) , and therefore the majority of the gamma - ray emission may come from the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "we have investigated the x - ray and uv emission from psr  j2129 - 0429  with _",
    "xmm - newton_. both x - ray and uv light curves are significantly modulated at the orbital period .",
    "the x - ray emission is found to be non - thermal dominant with a small thermal contribution which presumably from the neutron star surface .",
    "while the intensity of the non - thermal emission varies across the orbit , we found the thermal component is essentially constant in all orbital phases .",
    "the x - ray modulation has a double - peak structure with a dip in between .",
    "this is similar to the original black widow psr b1957 + 20 ( huang et al .",
    "2012 ) , in which the dip appears when the secondary is between the pulsar and the earth and its x - ray modulation can be explained by the doppler boosting of the shocked pulsar wind that wraps the secondary star . since we do not have any information of the radial velocity of the companion of psr  j2129 - 0429  from either optical spectroscopy or radio timing observation",
    ", we could not determine the geometry of its orbit with the current data .",
    "however , the phase of the x - ray dip / minimum align with the phase of optical minima , suggesting the x - ray dip / minimum are at either inferior conjunction or superior conjunction . in this scenario ,",
    "the x - ray modulation can be caused by the doppler boosting effect ( see huang et al .",
    "2012 for a detailed discussion ) .    the optical modulation from the black widow and redback msps",
    "are usually observed with a single broad peak , since the hemisphere of the secondary star is heated by the irradiation of the strong pulsar radiations .",
    "the double peaks with 0.5 phase separation seen in figure  [ lc ] suggests that the optical modulation of psr  j2129 - 0429 is not caused by the irradiation of the strong pulsar radiation .",
    "hence , it is expected that psr  j2129 - 0429 belongs to a special case of the redback .",
    "table  1 summaries the parameters of the redbacks in the galactic field ( see roberts 2012 ; romani & shaw 2011 ; kong et al .",
    "2012 ) ; the projected separation between two stars ( @xmath101 , sixth column ) is calculated from ( frank et al .",
    "2002 ) , @xmath102 cm , where @xmath103 is the neutron star mass and @xmath104 with @xmath105 being the inferred minimum mass ( fifth column ) of the secondary and @xmath106 is the orbital inclination . in all the following estimation / modeling , we assume @xmath107 . we further calculate the typical size of the roche - lobe from @xmath108^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "the last column shows the ratio of the stellar luminosity without heating ( @xmath109 ) and the pulsar luminosity deposited onto the stellar surface ( @xmath110 ) , that is @xmath111 .",
    "since the lack of the optical observations for most of the redbacks and the secondary star is a non - degenerate star , we infer the stellar luminosity without heating using a simple relation @xmath112 with @xmath113 for a main sequence star . for example , the effective temperature of the unheated side of the secondary is @xmath114k for psr j2339 - 0533 ( romani & shaw 2011 ) and @xmath115k for j1023 + 0038  ( thorstensen & armstrong 2005 ) .",
    "the inferred stellar luminosities are @xmath116 for j2339 - 0533 and @xmath117 for j1023 + 0038 , respectively , which can be fitted by @xmath112 with a index @xmath113 . in the calculation",
    ", we used the parameter of psr  j2333 - 0533 for the normalization .",
    "the heating luminosity @xmath110 is calculated from @xmath118 , where @xmath119 . in table  1 , we see that the stellar luminosity of the secondary of psr j2129 - 0429 can significantly exceed the heating luminosity , suggesting the heating effect is negligible in the optical light curve .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the redback psr j1723 - 2838 has similar orbital properties to psr  j2129 - 0429 .",
    "psr j1723 - 2838 may be another candidate that shows no heating effect in the optical light curve .",
    "apart from the pulsar wind , the irradiation of the gev gamma - rays from the pulsar is a possible heating mechanism of the secondary star in the black widows / redbacks ( c.f .",
    "takata et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "in such a case , the absence of heating of psr  j2129 - 0429 suggest the gamma - ray beam does not direct toward its companion .    assuming that the companion of psr  j2129 - 0429  fills the roche - lobe , we constrain the viewing angle of the system by modeling the uv light curve .",
    "we assume the roche - lobe filling factor to be unity and the observed uv photons are produced on the roche - lobe surface ( i.e. optical depth is unity on the roche - lobe surface ) .",
    "the roche - equipotential is given by ( frank et al .",
    "2002 ) @xmath120 where we assume two stars orbit on @xmath121 plane , and we used @xmath122 of psr  j2129 - 0429 .",
    "the roche - lobe surface is defined by the plane @xmath123 , where the inner lagrangian point @xmath124 is calculated from      we divided the roche - lobe surface into many segments . for the limb darkening to each segment",
    ", we used a simple linear law , @xmath126 ( van  hamme 1993 ) , where @xmath127 is the cosine of the angle between the local vector normal to the roche - lobe surface and the earth viewing angle .",
    "we chose a typical limb darkening coefficient @xmath128 .",
    "we ignored the effects of the gravity darkening ( lucy 1967 ) for simplicity .",
    "hence the observed brightness of each segment is proportional to the intensity @xmath129 times the projected segment area . in the bottom panel of figure  [ lc ]",
    ", we compare the uv light curve and the model light curves for various earth viewing angles @xmath130 , where @xmath131 corresponds to the edge - on view . in fig .",
    "[ lc ] , we can see that a larger viewing angle is preferred .",
    "this can explain the presence of extensive radio eclipse and the x - ray orbital modulation caused by the doppler boosting effect . since the current errors of the optical data are huge , high signal - to - noise optical observations will be required to tightly constrain the viewing geometry .",
