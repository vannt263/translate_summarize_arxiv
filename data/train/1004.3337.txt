    "generally , @xmath1 is coupled with @xmath2 , the abundance of present total matter , in the form of @xmath4 .",
    "previous studies have found @xmath9 in the range 0.30.6 and @xmath10 in the range 0.61.2 ( see table  [ comp ] in section  [ discu ] ) .",
    "the determined @xmath1 in recent years ( 20022009 ) has a mean value of 0.73@xmath110.05 assuming @xmath8 , which is in agreement with the wmap data @xcite , but lower than those by weak lensing statistics @xcite , galaxy - galaxy correlations @xcite and ly@xmath9 forest @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of cluster mass function has large uncertainties , mainly caused by the uncertain normalization of the mass scaling relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "other uncertainties come from the scatter of mass scaling relation and the incompleteness of the x - ray flux - limited cluster samples @xcite .",
    "the cluster mass function may be underestimated if only x - ray clusters are used . @xcite and @xcite have noticed the existence of a class of x - ray - underluminous massive clusters .",

    "the scaling relations of cluster mass have been determined for three optical observations , cluster richness , summed luminosity and @xmath21 .",
    "the scaling relations are then used to estimate cluster mass for two samples of rich clusters .",
    "we get cluster mass functions and fit them with a theoretical expression .",
    "cosmological parameters are constrained in the form of @xmath4 , with @xmath50.400.50 and @xmath60.80.9 . for @xmath8 ,",
    "we get @xmath70.80.9 using different mass tracers or using the rich cluster samples at different redshift ranges .",
    "the @xmath1 values from the mass tracers of richness @xmath22 and @xmath21 obtained using both cluster samples are consistent , while @xmath1 values derived from @xmath23 are higher .",
    "this discrepancy may come from some potential systematic bias on the mass scaling relations .",
    "if the @xmath24@xmath23 relations for both samples are really unbiased , then the cluster masses tracer by richness @xmath22 and @xmath21 are systematically underestimated . however , it is hard to assess which one is a better mass tracer . given the scarce of mass estimates from different methods for the same clusters in table  [ mass ] for the scaling relations , it is also hard to estimate the systematic bias on these mass estimates due to different methods ( x - ray or weak lensing ) . in our work ,",
    "one potential systematic bias may come from the conversion of cluster mass from measured radii to the virial radius . here , we use @xmath25 to stand for the systematic bias of masses in table  [ mass ] , where @xmath26 stands for the true virial mass of a cluster . assuming a @xmath27 , we get @xmath26 and then fit the mass function of clusters to obtain @xmath1 . figure  [ gamma ] shows the variation of @xmath1 ( with @xmath8 fixed ) as a function @xmath27 based on the @xmath24@xmath23 relation .",
    "we are only concerned about the cases @xmath28 .",
    "for example @xmath29 , i.e. , masses systematically overestimated by 30% , the values of @xmath1 are lower by about 10% .",
    "in fact , the deviation of @xmath27 from 1.0 is related to the uncertainty of intercept in the logarithm scaling relations in equation  ( [ mr])([mggn2 ] ) .",
    "the other possible systematic bias on @xmath1 may come from the slope uncertainties of the scaling relations . here , we illustrate the dependence of @xmath1 on the slope uncertainty , @xmath30 .",
    "we only apply to the @xmath24@xmath23 relation , for example .",
    "given a @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 , here @xmath32 according to equation  ( [ ml ] ) and ( [ ml2 ] ) , we fit the power law with the data in figure  [ richmass ] and [ richmass2 ] to get @xmath33 , and then get the cluster mass function and fit for @xmath1 . figure  [ slope ] shows the @xmath1 value varies with @xmath30 .",
    "we find that the @xmath1 from the cluster sample of @xmath34 does not change significantly with @xmath30 , while the @xmath1 decreases from 1.05 to 0.81 for the cluster sample of @xmath35 when the slope varies by @xmath30 from -0.4 to 0.4",
    ".    we can compare our results of @xmath1 with previous determinations from cluster mass function , as listed in table  [ comp ] .",
    "most of previous results are based on x - ray flux - limited cluster samples .",
    "our results are systematically larger than those from the mass function of x - ray clusters .",
    "@xcite used the largest number of clusters from sdss maxbcg catalog to determine the amplitude of cluster mass function .",
    "they did not estimate the mass for each cluster , but gave a statistical mass for clusters within a richness bins by weak lensing .",
    "they got @xmath36 assuming @xmath37 .",
    "the maxbcg clusters were selected based on the red brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) .",
    "however , the maxbcg method may miss about 25% clusters in which the bcgs have emission line and blue colors @xcite .",
    "we notice that about 15% rich clusters ( @xmath38 ) are missing by the maxbcg method compared to our sample in the redshift range of @xmath39 .",
    "however , the systematic incompleteness only induces an underestimate of 3% for @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the discrepancy probably comes from the uncertainty of mass scaling relations .",
    "if we take @xmath40 derived from wmap7 , then our values of @xmath1 should become larger by a factor of @xmath41 , roughly equal to adding 0.05 to the our @xmath1 value in table  [ comp ] .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1 values we derived from galaxy clusters are slightly larger than the those from the wmap data @xcite . while some reanalysis of the wmap5 data independently @xcite gives @xmath42 for @xmath43 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "some studies of cosmic microwave background at small scales also give higher values of @xmath1 than that from wmap @xcite .",
    "our result of @xmath1 are consistent with many recent studies using other methods .",
    "for example , the @xmath1 by weak lensing method has a mean value of 0.85@xmath110.03 ( see previous results in table 5 of * ? ? ? * ) , which is higher than previous results from x - ray clusters .",
    "@xcite studied the power spectrum of galaxies from the sdss to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "they obtained @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite studied the normalization of the power spectrum via the ellipticity function of giant galaxy voids from sdss dr5 and obtained @xmath46 .",
    "@xcite used the ly@xmath9 data and found @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "@xcite used the galaxy peculiar velocities to probe the growth rate of the structure and found that @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    in this work ,",
    "we get six values of @xmath1 by cluster mass function .",
    "basically , the results are consistent .",
    "however , the precise value of @xmath1 is still to be determined since our constraint is not only coupled with @xmath2 , but also has large uncertainties on the scaling relations .",
