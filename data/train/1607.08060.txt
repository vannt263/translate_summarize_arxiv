    "reverberation mapping ( rm ) is a powerful tool to probe the geometry and structure of broad - line regions ( blrs ) in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( @xcite ) . over the past four decades ,",
    "great efforts on rm monitoring have yielded a precious sample of @xmath6 nearby seyfert galaxies and quasars with measurements of h@xmath0 time lags ( e.g. , @xcite ) , among them ngc  5548 , the best - observed source that has been intensively monitored by 17 individual rm campaigns , including the recent space telescope and optical reverberation mapping project ( agn storm ; @xcite ; see @xcite for a summary of the first 13 campaigns ; @xcite ) .",
    "ngc  5548 therefore serves as a valuable laboratory to study in detail the long - term variations of the blr ( @xcite ) , as well as the consistency and reliability of rm - based black hole ( bh ) mass measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "ngc 5548 follows the relation @xmath7 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath8 is the optical luminosity at 5100  .",
    "this relation for ngc 5548 is significantly different from the well - known radius@xmath9luminosity relation @xmath10 for the overall rm sample ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this difference needs to be understood . on the other hand",
    ", the geometry and kinematics of the blr in ngc 5548 have been investigated by velocity - resolved mapping in several studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and by recently developed dynamical modelling @xcite using the data taken by the 2008 lick agn monitoring project ( lamp ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the inferred blr dynamics seems diverse , and there is no consensus .",
    "to investigate the above issues , we conducted a new observational campaign for ngc 5548 in 2015 .",
    "this paper presents the results of our new rm campaign . in section 2",
    ", we describe the observations and the data reduction in detail . in section 3",
    ", we perform the time series analysis and measure the h@xmath0 time lags and construct the velocity - resolved lags of the broad @xmath11 line .",
    "we investigate the structure and dynamics of the blr in section 4 , and discuss the bh mass measurements , accretion rates , and the long - term variations of blr size in section 5 .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section 6 . throughout the paper , a cosmology with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is adopted ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric observations of ngc  5548 were made using the yunnan faint object spectrograph and camera ( yfosc ) , mounted on the lijiang 2.4 m telescope at yunnan observatory , chinese academy of sciences .",
    "working at the cassegrain focus , yfosc is a versatile instrument for low - resolution spectroscopy and photometry .",
    "it is equipped with a back - illuminated 2048@xmath152048 pixel ccd , with pixel size 13.5 @xmath16 m , pixel scale 0.283@xmath17 per pixel , and field - of - view @xmath18 .",
    "yfosc can automatically switch from spectroscopy to photometry within 1 s ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our observations started on january 7 , 2015 and ended on july 11 , 2015 . to get an accurate flux calibration",
    ", we simultaneously observed a nearby comparison star along the long - slit as a reference standard .",
    "such an observation strategy was described in detail by @xcite and @xcite , and was recently adopted by @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : img ] , we chose the star labeled `` no.1 '' as the comparison star . given the seeing of @xmath19 throughout the monitoring period , we fixed the projected slit width at @xmath20 .",
    "we used grism 14 , which provides a resolution of 92  mm@xmath21 ( 1.8  pixel@xmath21 ) and covers the wavelength range 3800@xmath97200  .",
    "standard neon and helium lamps were used for wavelength calibration . to reduce atmospheric differential refraction , we limited the observations to airmasses @xmath22 .",
    "this guarantees an atmospheric refraction @xmath23 over the wavelength range @xmath24  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mean airmass for all the spectra is @xmath25 , so that any offset of the target from the slit center due to atmospheric refraction is limited to @xmath26 , which has a negligible impact on our analysis .    to verify the calibration of the spectroscopic data",
    ", we also made photometric observations using a johnson @xmath27 filter .",
    "we took three consecutive exposures of 90 s each . in total , we obtained 62 spectroscopic observations and 61 photometric observations , spanning a time period of 180 days .",
    "the typical cadence is @xmath28 days .",
    "the two - dimensional spectroscopic images were reduced using the standard iraf tools before absolute flux calibration .",
    "this includes bias subtraction , flat - field correction , and wavelength calibration .",
    "all the spectra were extracted using a uniform aperture of 30 pixels ( 8.5@xmath29 ) , and the background was determined from two adjacent regions on either side of the aperture region . as described in @xcite ,",
    "absolute flux calibration was done in two steps .",
    "( 1 ) the observations taken during nights with good weather conditions were used to calibrate the absolute flux of the comparison star , which was then used as the fiducial spectrum for absolute flux standard for the science observations .",
    "( 2 ) for each object / comparison star pair , a wavelength - dependent sensitivity function was obtained by comparing the star s spectrum to the fiducial spectrum .",
    "then this sensitivity function was applied to calibrate the observed spectrum of the target .",
    "the spectra calibrated in this way show a small fluctuation of the  flux at a level of 2% , which can be regarded as the accuracy of our absolute flux calibration .",
    "the @xmath27-band images were also reduced using standard iraf ( v2.16 ) procedures .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were measured with respect to five selected reference stars in the field ( see figure [ fig : img ] ) .",
    "the typical accuracy of the photometry is 0.015 mag .",
    "following @xcite , we measured the 5100   continuum and broad h@xmath0 line using a spectral fitting scheme .",
    "the fitting components include ( 1 ) a single power - law continuum ; ( 2 ) a stellar component for the host galaxy ; ( 3 ) emission ; ( 4 ) broad h@xmath0 emission line ; ( 5 ) broad emission line ; and ( 6 ) narrow emission lines of , , h@xmath0 , and several coronal lines ( such as [ fe vii ] @xmath30 , [ fe vi ] @xmath31 and [ ca v ] @xmath32 ; see the details in @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral template for the host galaxy is a stellar population model with an age of 11 gyr and a metallicity @xmath33 @xcite .    during the observations , seeing variations and mis - centering of the object in the slit lead to varying amounts of host galaxy light in the final spectrum . to remove this effect ,",
    "the flux of the host galaxy component is set to a free parameter in our fitting scheme . during the whole monitoring period ,",
    "the @xmath11 emission line of ngc  5548 showed extreme broad wings , in addition to a strong narrow component .",
    "we slightly modified the fitting scheme of @xcite in two aspects , by adding a narrow component to @xmath11 and using three gaussians to fit the broad component .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec_fit ] shows the fitting results for the mean spectrum of our campaign and for an individual spectrum .",
    "we measured the 5100   continuum from the best - fit power - law component and the @xmath11 flux by integrating the best - fit broad components of @xmath11 from @xmath34 to @xmath35 . for the purpose of constructing the velocity - resolved delay map ( see section  [ sec : vrm ] ) , we obtained the broad @xmath11 profile by subtracting the host galaxy , and emission lines , and the narrow component of h@xmath0 .",
    "table  [ tab : lc_dat ] summarizes the light curves .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc_ccf ] plots the light curves of the @xmath36band photometry ( instrumental magnitude in an arbitrary unit ) , 5100 continuum , and broad @xmath11 flux .",
    "following standard practice ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we calculate the variability amplitude of the light curves of the 5100   continuum and h@xmath0 emission line by @xmath37 and its uncertainty ( @xcite ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the average flux , @xmath40 is the flux of the @xmath41-th observation of the light curve , @xmath42 is the total number of observations , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the uncertainty of @xmath40 .",
    "table  [ tab : lcst ] lists the statistics of the light curves .",
    "the variability amplitudes of the 5100   continuum and broad h@xmath0 line are @xmath46 and 0.10 , respectively , which are generally comparable with those of previous rm campaigns , after correcting for host galaxy and narrow h@xmath0 contributions ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also calculate another standard measure of variability , @xmath47 , simply defined by the ratio of maximum to minimum flux .",
    "the values of @xmath47 are 2.31 and 1.52 for the 5100   continuum and broad h@xmath0 line , respectively .",
    "we compute the time lag of h@xmath0 line flux relative to 5100   continuum using the interpolation cross - correlation function method ( iccf ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the time lag is measured by two standard approaches : the peak location @xmath48 of the iccf ( @xmath49 ) and the centroid @xmath50 of the iccf around the peak above a typical value ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "their respective uncertainties were obtained using the monte carlo `` flux randomization@xmath52random subset sampling '' method described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo simulations were run with 1000 realizations , and the distributions of the peak and centroid ( ccpd and cccd ) were created from the generated samples .",
    "the uncertainties of @xmath48 and @xmath50 are then calculated from the ccpd and cccd , respectively , with a 68.3% confidence level ( @xmath53 ) .    in figures  [ fig : lc_ccf](@xmath54 ) and [ fig :",
    "lc_ccf](@xmath55 ) , we show the auto cross - correlation function ( acf ) of the light curve of 5100   continuum , the iccf between the h@xmath0 flux and 5100   continuum , and the ccpd and cccd of the iccf , respectively .",
    "we find that the iccf peak occurs at @xmath56 days ( @xmath57 ) and the iccf centroid occurs at @xmath58 days in the rest frame ( see table  [ tab : rm_p ] ) . as an independent check , we also calculate the z - transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and superpose the corresponding zdcf in figures [ fig : lc_ccf](@xmath54 ) and [ fig : lc_ccf](@xmath55 ) .",
    "as can be seen , the zdcfs are in good agreement with the iccfs .",
    "velocity - resolved rm is widely used to reveal the kinematic signatures of blrs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the high - quality spectroscopic data of our campaign allow us to construct the velocity - binned delay map of the h@xmath0 line .",
    "our procedure is as follows . using the method described in the appendix",
    ", we first calculate the rms spectrum of the broad h@xmath0 profiles obtained in section [ sec : lc ] .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig:2d_tv](_a _ ) , we then select a wavelength range from 4731 to 4991   in the rest frame and divide the @xmath11 profiles into nine uniformly spaced bins ( each bin has a velocity width of @xmath59 ) for the @xmath60 slit , significantly smaller than the width of the velocity bin . we thus did not employ the method of du et al . ( 2016b ) to correct the spectra for instrumental broadening . ] . the light curve of each bin",
    "is finally obtained by just integrating the flux in the bin .",
    "the time lag of each bin and the associated uncertainties are determined using the same procedures as described in section  [ tdr ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig:2d_lc ] , we plot the obtained light curves of the nine bins , along with the light curve of the 5100   continuum for the sake of comparison .",
    "the corresponding iccfs between the light curve of each bin and the continuum are shown in the right panels of figure  [ fig:2d_lc ] , in which the cccd and ccpd are also superposed .",
    "the velocity - resolved delay map is plotted in figure  [ fig:2d_tv](_b _ ) .",
    "we can find that the delay map has a symmetric pattern , with longer response at the line core and shorter response at the wings ( except for bin 5 ) .",
    "velocity - resolved delay maps of the broad h@xmath0 line in ngc  5548 were derived previously in the mdm campaign undertaken in 2007 ( @xcite ) and in the lamp campaign in 2008 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the delay map of our campaign is very similar to that of the mdm campaign .",
    "@xcite conclude that the symmetric delay map of ngc 5548 indicates that there is no radial gas motion in the blr .",
    "the data quality of the lamp campaign is relatively poor so that the resulting delay map in @xcite does not reveal clear signatures for the blr motion .",
    "however , @xcite carried out dynamical modeling of the lamp data and found that a narrow thick - disk - like blr geometry with dominant inflows can explain the variations of the broad h@xmath0 line . on the other hand , it is worth mentioning that the velocity - resolved delay map of the agn storm campaign derived by @xcite shows a symmetric structure . in the future , detailed analysis of the present data through dynamical modeling ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "will better constrain the kinematics of the h@xmath0 blr .",
    "this section examines the virial assumption for the blr motions and the relation between the h@xmath0 blr size and optical luminosity , by combining data from all the available rm campaigns of ngc  5548 .",
    "we compile the width and time lags of @xmath11 from the literature ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "re - calibrated the 5100  flux using the updated flux measurements of the host galaxy given in @xcite .",
    "we directly take these re - calibrated fluxes to calculate the 5100   luminosity .",
    "table  [ tab : tot ] summarizes all the rm measurements of h@xmath0 lag , h@xmath0 flux , and the dispersion and full width half maximum ( fwhm ) velocity of the h@xmath0 line from rms and mean spectra .",
    "we employ the method of @xcite to measure the fwhm and @xmath61 of @xmath11 from the mean and rms spectra ( table 3 ; appendix ) .",
    "we find @xmath62 , which is larger than 2.35 for a gaussian profile , indicating that the blr has less turbulent motion @xcite .",
    "we calculate the virial product ( table 4 ) @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the h@xmath0 time lag , @xmath65 is the speed of light , @xmath66 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath27 is the line width .",
    "if the blr motion is dominated by the gravity of the central bh and is virialized , vp should be constant , and @xmath67 .",
    "figure  [ fig : w_t ] shows the relation between @xmath27 and @xmath64 using four measures of line width , namely @xmath61 and fwhm from the mean and rms spectra .",
    "the relations between @xmath27 and @xmath64 have a slope of ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) for @xmath61 and fwhm of the rms and mean spectra , respectively .",
    "generally , the h@xmath0 line width obeys the virial relation within the uncertainties , consistent with the results reported by @xcite and @xcite . to quantitatively describe any deviation of the blr motion from the virial relation , we define a parameter @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the average virial product .",
    "we find that the deviation @xmath74 for @xmath61 and fwhm of the rms and mean spectra , respectively .",
    "figures  [ fig : f_l](_a _ ) and ( _ b _ ) show the distribution of vp as a function of optical luminosity .",
    "compared with the previous analysis of @xcite and @xcite , we extend the analysis by including the latest rm measurements . using the procedure ` fitexy ` of @xcite , we obtain the regressions @xmath75          ( 7.97\\pm 0.05)+(0.36\\pm0.20)\\log \\ell_{43 } & ( { \\rm for~ fwhm } ) ,            \\end{array}\\right .",
    "\\label{eqn5}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 .",
    "figures  [ fig : f_l](_c _ ) and ( _ d _ ) show that the distributions of vp@xmath77 and vp@xmath78 have a large scatter ( 0.31 and 0.32 dex , respectively ) .",
    "we note that the weak correlation between vp and luminosity is not in conflict with the notion that the blr is predominantly virialized .",
    "even if variations in radiation pressure induces secular departures from virial equilibrium , the kinematics gradually adjusts to restore a quasi - virialized state .",
    "this test shows that the method for determining the bh mass is robust as long as the factor @xmath79 is reliably calibrated .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath80 relation of ngc 5548 has a much steeper slope than 0.5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : r_l](_a _ ) reemphasises this point , by including the new measurement from our campaign . using ` fitexy `",
    ", we obtain the best - fit regression of @xmath81 where @xmath76 . with the addition of the new data ,",
    "our derived relation is slightly steeper than that reported by kilerci eser et al .",
    "( 2015 ; @xmath7 ) . both slopes are steeper than the value of 0.5 expected from simple photoionization theory . for completeness",
    ", figure  [ fig : r_l](_b _ ) also shows the best - fit regression of the relation between the h@xmath0 blr size and the h@xmath0 luminosity , @xmath82 .",
    "recently , based on data from simultaneous optical and uv observations , @xcite established the connection between the 5100   and the 1350   luminosity , as @xmath83 . using this relation , we deduce @xmath84 ,",
    "which is consistent with the expected slope of 0.5 .",
    "this non - linear relation between the optical and uv emissions implies a complicated geometry for the accretion disk and the importance of radiative reprocessing ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "following standard practice , we estimate the bh mass as @xmath85 where @xmath79 is a coefficient that crudely accounts for the unknown inclination , geometry , and kinematics of the blr .",
    "@xcite point out that the blr in pseudobulges notably has a lower @xmath86 than in classical bulges . for line dispersion @xmath61 measured from rms spectra , @xmath87 for pseudobulges , whereas @xmath4 for classical bulges .",
    "the latter is roughly consistent , within uncertainties , with previous calibrations that do not take the bulge type into consideration ( e.g. , @xmath88 ; @xcite ) .",
    "ngc  5548 hosts a classical bulge ( @xcite ) .",
    "using @xmath89 , we derive a bh mass of @xmath90 ; line dispersion measured from mean spectra , @xmath91 @xcite and @xmath92 .",
    "the two mass measurements are in good agreement .",
    "meanwhile , our measurements are also consistent , within the uncertainties , with the overall values from previous rm campaigns .",
    "a notable exception is the work of @xcite ; applying the blr dynamical modeling developed by @xcite to the lamp data on ngc  5548 , they obtain , without invoking the virial factor , @xmath93 , which is only about half of the virial - based value .    the classical bulge of ngc  5548 has a central stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath94  ( @xcite ) , resulting in @xmath95 from the latest @xmath96 relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is marginally larger than the virial - based bh mass estimate , after taking into account the intrinsic scatter of the virial factor ( @xcite ) , but significantly exceeds the bh mass determination based on dynamical modeling of the blr by @xcite .    with the bh mass in hand",
    ", we can calculate the dimensionless accretion rate , defined as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath99 is the eddington luminosity , @xmath100 is the bolometric luminosity ( see table  [ tab : sed ] ) , and @xmath101 is the radiative efficiency of the accretion disk . using a bh mass of @xmath102 and a mean bolometric luminosity of @xmath103 ( table  [ tab : sed ] ) , we obtain @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "the bh in ngc 5548 has an accretion rate in the regime of the standard accretion disk model ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that the above accretion rate is inaccurate if ngc 5548 hosts a binary supermassive bh , as recently suggested by @xcite based on the detection of periodic variations in luminosity and velocity .",
    "figure  [ fig : obs_time ] shows the variations of the mean @xmath106 and @xmath107 over all the 18 campaigns since 1989 .",
    "the variation amplitude of @xmath106 exceeds an order of magnitude .",
    "the lowest @xmath108 occurred in 2005@xmath92009 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the highest @xmath109 in 19981999 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath107 also exhibits large variations , from @xmath110 up to @xmath111 light - days .",
    "simple inspection of figure  [ fig : obs_time ] reveals that the changes in @xmath107 follow the variations of @xmath106 , but plausibly with a time delay . using the same procedure for computing h@xmath0 lags , we determine the lag of @xmath107 with respect to @xmath106 : @xmath112yrs . from analysis of the cccd and ccpd , the probability of @xmath113yrs @xmath114 and 0.098 , respectively , suggesting that there may be a potential delay between @xmath107 and @xmath106 . clearly , we need more rm monitoring campaigns to verify this intriguing , but tentative result .",
    "there are two timescales for the ionized clouds in the blr .",
    "the recombination timescale is @xmath115min , where @xmath116 is the electron density of the clouds and @xmath117 is the case b recombination coefficient @xcite .",
    "the fast response of the ionization front exactly follows the ionizing luminosity , as shown by equation ( 6 ) . however , radiation pressure , if effective , drives the clouds to outwards , changes their orbits , and leads to variations of their spatial distribution .",
    "the observed size of the blr is actually an emissivity - averaged value over the whole blr , namely @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the emissivity of the clouds , determined by their spatial distribution ( or , equivalently , their number density ) .",
    "radiation pressure induces changes in @xmath119 , and thereby @xmath107 . considering that the h@xmath0 line width represents the bulk motion of the clouds , the dynamical timescale of the blr is given by ( @xcite ) @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the quantity @xmath123 represents the typical timescale with which @xmath107 varies in response to a change in the blr dynamics . for ngc  5548 , the average h@xmath0 lag of @xmath124 days and line width of @xmath125 = 6000",
    "km s@xmath21 leads to a dynamical timescale of @xmath126yrs .",
    "interestingly , @xmath127 , indicating that the blr could be jointly controlled by radiation pressure and bh gravity .",
    "a mass inflow to the center can give rise to variations of the blr and the accretion disk , but changes in the blr structure ( size ) should precede changes in the disk luminosity .",
    "the delayed response of the blr size to continuum luminosity may rule out this possibility , plausibly implicating the potential role of radiation pressure .",
    "we present results of a new rm campaign on ngc  5548 based on high - quality optical spectra taken in 2015 .",
    "we measure a centroid time lag for the broad @xmath11 line of @xmath128 days in the rest frame . adopting a virial factor of @xmath4 and an h@xmath0 line dispersion of @xmath129 , we measured a bh mass of @xmath130 .",
    "we obtain the following results :    * the velocity - resolved delay map of the broad h@xmath0 line shows a symmetric structure , consistent with the previous results of @xcite . *",
    "the relation between h@xmath0 line width and h@xmath0 time lag is consistent with virial motions .",

    "the blr size of ngc 5548 follows @xmath131 , steeper than the slope of @xmath132 for the global @xmath133 relation for all rm agns . *",
    "examining the variation patterns of @xmath107 and @xmath106 , we find tentative evidence that @xmath107 follows @xmath106 with a delay of @xmath134yrs .",
    "this is consistent with the dynamical timescale of the blr , implying that the long - term variations of the blr may be driven by radiation pressure .",

    "<S> the high - quality data allow us to construct a velocity - binned delay map for the broad h@xmath0 line , which shows a symmetric response pattern around the line center , a plausible kinematic signature of virialized motion of the blr . combining all the available measurements of h@xmath0 time lags and the associated mean 5100   luminosities over 18 campaigns between 1989 and 2015 , we find that the h@xmath0 blr size varies with the mean optical luminosity , but , interestingly , with a possible delay of @xmath5yrs . </S>",
