    "a surprisingly good correlation between the equivalent width ( @xmath1 ) of the diffuse interstellar band ( dib ) at 8620  and the interstellar reddening ( @xmath2 ) has been reported by  @xcite .",
    "the relation was calibrated as @xmath3 on the base of 37 stars widely distributed in galactic coordinates and distances .",
    "however , the exact slope of the relation is expected to depend on the properties of the interstellar medium and to vary with direction and distance .",
    "the most general relation would thus be @xmath4    gaia will determine @xmath2 from the photometric measurements .",
    "if the 8620  dib will be resolved from rvs spectra , the fine - grid calibration of @xmath5 will be performed and thus the distribution and the chemical composition of the interstellar matter will be obtained . moreover ,",
    "the exact wavelength position of the 8620  dib will reveal the information on the kinematics of the interstellar matter .",
    "the purpose of the here presented simulation was to check for the limitations and to estimate the distance range of this interstellar mapping method .",
    "the galactic stellar population was simulated with the besanon model of stellar population synthesis  @xcite .",
    "the interstellar extinction was taken into account with the use of the three - dimensional model of the dust distribution by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "simulations were performed in 42 galactic directions ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) with the solid angles varying between 0.2 and 15 square degrees for different galactic directions in order to keep the number of the simulated stars approximately constant , i.e. between 5000 and 15000 .",
    "simulated galactic directions are shown in figure  [ galactic_results_angle ] .",
    "two exemplary stellar samples are presented in figure  [ stellar_sample ] .    .",
    "the sizes of the solid angles that varied between 0.2 and 15 square degrees are presented in a relative scale with the sizes of the black dots . ]",
    "the simulation of the dib detection accuracy was performed as follows . for any star given by the besanon model the closest computed synthetic spectrum  @xcite from the multi - parameter spectral grid",
    "was taken .",
    "the spectrum was then shifted for the star s radial velocity and the 8620  dib gaussian line , doppler shifted for between 0 and the shift of the star was added .",
    "the width of the gaussian line was taken as in  @xcite , i.e. @xmath19 was taken to be @xmath20 and the amplitude was determined from @xmath1 .",
    "finally , the noise appropriate to the star s magnitude and the rvs instrument  @xcite was added to the synthetic spectrum .",
    "in addition to the simulated star spectrum the synthetic spectrum template was generated , which differed from the simulated spectrum for one step in each of the parameters ( temperature , metallicity  ) of the spectral grid .",
    "it also differed in the radial velocity  @xcite and possessed no dib line .",
    "the generated template was subtracted from the rvs simulated spectrum and the 8620  dib line was resolved from the residuum by fitting the gaussian line with three parameters , i.e. @xmath1 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 on it .",
    "interstellar extinction is responsible for both , the imprint of the 8620  dib line in the stellar spectra and the increase of stellar magnitudes that limits the detection of the dib line . it is not surprising , that the simulation results indicate the following . high interstellar extinction is a strong limiting factor in the galactic plane where the achievable range of the interstellar matter mapping via the 8620  dib line is smaller than 5kpc .",
    "when going out from the galactic plane the 8620  dib line can be detected in stellar spectra up to distances 10 - 15kpc .",
    "finally , at very high latitudes the imprint of small interstellar extinction becomes weak , which again reduces the detection of the dib line .",
    "tracing of the 8620  dib line varies also with the galactic longitude .",
    "the galactic map with the achieved distance ranges for the interstellar matter mapping via the 8620  dib line is shown in figure  [ galactic_results_distance ] .",
    "results of the 8620  dib line recovery from the simulated rvs spectra in six galactic directions are shown in figures  [ l010_distance_histogram ] and  [ l010_ew_diff_histogram ] .                to conclude ,",
    "simulated rvs data indicate that the 8620  dib line will be detected in the rvs spectra of relatively faint stars with magnitudes up to @xmath23 with sufficient accuracy to trace not only the distribution of the interstellar medium but also the radial component of its kinematic motion . however , it is necessary to point out that the obtained results of the simulation should be further constrained by more careful treatment of the s / n issue .",
    "other realistic problems such as crowding in the stellar field should also be taken into account .",
    "we thank annie robin from the observatoire de besanon for generating the galactic stellar population which was used as the input for our simulation .",
    "the financial support from the conference organizers is kindly acknowledged .",
