    "therefore , change of refractive index of the order of @xmath58 causes change of @xmath51 of the order of @xmath59 rad , much more than phase - matching ring width . by analogy",

    "dominant contribution of the doppler broadening is present in single - photon terms , which we take into account as full voigt profiles in the above calculation .",
    "however , there is also residual doppler broadening in the two - photon terms with @xmath76 . since calculation of this term is time - consuming while the broadening is small , we decided to replace it by additional natural broadening , which is of quite different shape , but gives similar and consistent results",

    "[ fig : kat],scaledwidth=75.0% ]    in the following section we compare our experimental and theoretical results to demonstrate the importance of the phase - matching condition and finally engineer the optimal geometry for the process .",
    "first , we observe the dependence of the average emission angle @xmath94 of the four - wave mixing signal on detuning @xmath89 , while remaining detunings are kept constant . in particular ,",
    "driving beam 1 is far detuned from the resonance ( @xmath81 mhz ) , while being simultaneously kept in the two - photon resonance , i.e. @xmath82 . from the theoretical point of view , the phase - matching ring , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : teoryja ] , has finite width and overlaps with the gaussian factor from eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplituda ] ) at either side .",
    "for that reason , the emission angle @xmath94 changes as a function of detuning ( in this case @xmath89 ) . in the experiment ,",
    "the full signal beam profile at the far field is measured with the ccd camera and the average emission angle is inferred from the image after electronic background subtraction . in the theoretical framework",
    "this corresponds to the angle calculated as :    @xmath95    measurement results and theoretical predictions results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : przesuwanie ] .",
    "we observe a strong correspondence between the two , which confirms that the reason of dependence between emission direction and lasers detunings is indeed dispersion and resulting change in phase matching .",
    "as far as the change of emission angle is perhaps the most direct consequence of dispersion and phase matching , another significant effect is the shift in optimum two - photon detuning @xmath76 for the four - wave mixing signal generation in relation to two - photon absorption maximum .",
    "this effect , sometimes also visible as a strong modification of spectrum , has been observed in several previous works @xcite , but its origin remained unexplained .",
    "simple theory , which neglects dispersion of refractive indices , predicts that maximum intensity of measured signal is exactly at the two - photon absorption maximum , as the third order polarizability @xmath96 and the two - photon absorption coefficient proportional to @xmath97 depends on the two - photon detuning @xmath76 in the very same way [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : chi3 ] ) and ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) ] .    in our model not only large polarizability @xmath96 is required , but also overlap between the phase - matching ring and gaussian factor from eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplituda ] ) .",
    "the latter condition is not necessarily met at @xmath82 . from this reasoning ,",
    "the frequency shift @xmath86 of maximum follows .",
    "an exemplary plot of the two - photon absorption and the four - wave mixing signals as a function of the two - photon detuning are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : przes ] .",
    "note a significant shift @xmath86 between the extrema of the two signals , marked with dashed lines .",
    "imperfect fit to theory is due to residual two - photon doppler broadening , accounted for in numerical calculations as a broadened lorentzian instead of a full voigt profile .",
    "the shift was measured for multiple values of detunings @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "experimental results , together with theoretical prediction , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : przes_cale ] . for different detunings",
    "the system exhibits different dispersion profiles , and thus we observe different frequency shifts @xmath98 .",
    "they confirm that dispersion and phase matching accurately explain dependence between the four - wave mixing signal intensity and laser detunings .",
    "note that the dispersion in the vicinity of the two - photon resonance changes with the optical depth of the medium ( or atom number density ) and consequently quite strongly depends on temperature of the atomic vapor cell @xcite .",
    "finally , we confirm that as originally intended the geometry of the experiment may be changed to tailor the four - wave mixing signal properties . from theory",
    "it follows that the overlap between the phase - matching ring and the gaussian factor decreases with any change of incident beams tilts @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : dthdfi ] ) ] .",
    "however , this overlap can fixed by adjusting detunings . as an example",
    ", we study how the maximum of the four - wave mixing signal changes as a function of @xmath89 detuning if we tilt the incident beam 3 .",
    "we performed the measurement for three different tilts presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : kat](a ) . figures [ fig : kat](b ) and [ fig : kat](c ) portray obtained experimental and theoretical results for the frequency shift @xmath86 and maximum intensity @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "we observe that the maximum of the four - wave mixing signal changes quite significantly .",
    "note , that without taking into account the phase - matching condition we only obtain @xmath102 dependance for the field amplitude [ as in eq .",
    "[ eq : chi3 ] ] , which would clearly give a completely incorrect theoretical prediction in this case . instead , the proper choice of geometry is critical when laser 4 is tuned closer or further from its respective single - photon resonance .",
    "these results demonstrate that our theoretical model may be used to precisely predict the behavior of the four - wave mixing signal , explaining a variety of intricacies .",
    "in particular , we may predict the optimum geometry for a desired set of detunings , or vice - versa .",
    "we have shown that a simple model of four - wave mixing in an atomic medium that neglects propagation effects could be easily extended by considering propagation equation with nonlinear polarization to account for phase matching . in the spatial fourier domain",
    ", the phase - matching condition implies that only some component wavevectors of the drive beams lead to effective wave - mixing .",
    "moreover , due to dispersion , the phase - matching conditions strongly depend on laser detunings .",
    "this approach allowed us to explain some phenomena which were unexplainable earlier , like the frequency shift of the four - wave mixing signal maximum in relation to two - photon absorption maximum @xcite .",
    "the most direct consequence of dispersion seems to be the change of the four - wave mixing signal emission angle as a function of laser detunings .",
    "these results show that our theoretical description is much more robust than an atomic model neglecting the influence of dispersion on phase matching in atomic medium and allows precise predictions of the four - wave mixing signal behavior .",
    "moreover , we have shown that our model facilitates proper choice of geometry and consequently stronger signal may be obtained . apart from providing a recipe for engineering of effective interaction , we believe that our results may also help study other subtle effects in four - wave mixing @xcite , where multiple shift effects might contribute to the total frequency shift . finally , we note that our approach is generally valid for a variety of systems - one needs to simply supply appropriate expressions for linear and nonlinear susceptibilities .",
    "in particular , effects treated in this work become even more critical in high - density ensembles , that facilitate strong light - matter interactions due to collective effects @xcite , in waveguides that support modes with various longitudinal wavevectors @xcite , in cavity - enhanced processes @xcite or finally in schemes that rely on phase - matching control , such as multimode quantum memories @xcite .",
    "if the four - wave mixing signal is weak as in quantum light - atom interfaces @xcite or processes involving rydberg states @xcite proper choice of geometry may be even more critical and yield a difference between having a strong signal or not obtaining the four - wave mixing signal at all .",
