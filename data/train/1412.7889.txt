    "the classification of texture images is an important problem in pattern recognition and consequently forms the subject of many research works in this field .",
    "texture is an important image feature with a strong discriminative capability and is therefore widely used in computer vision .",
    "the texture classification problem addressed in this paper is a multiclass classification problem and two different well - known databases are considered : the brodatz database , which contains a number of unique textures that each form a class , and the vistex database , which consists of a number of classes , each with several texture images belonging to it . for the brodatz database , ten subimages of the same size",
    "are taken from each texture to obtain different texture images for the corresponding class .",
    "for each texture image of both databases a feature vector , i.e.  a vector of characteristics , is obtained by using a novel method introduced in this paper , as well as by using a number of popular methods from literature . this feature vector",
    "is then employed to classify the different texture images using linear discriminant analysis ( lda ) following a stratified 10-fold cross - validation scheme .",
    "feature vectors for image texture are usually obtained from the analysis of groups of pixels and the way this analysis is performed is used to classify the different texture analysis methods .",
    "five main categories can be distinguished : structural  @xcite , statistical  @xcite , model - based  @xcite , spectral  @xcite , and agent - based methods  @xcite .",
    "this paper proposes a novel method to analyze the structural elements of textures by means of a cellular automaton ( ca ) inspired by the pitting corrosion phenomenon , further on referred to as the corrosion - inspired texture analysis ( cita ) method .",
    "the basic mechanisms behind this detrimental reaction which occurs between metals ( or alloys ) and their environment serve as inspiration to develop a ca - based model .",
    "next , this ca - based model is employed to perform texture analysis by treating the image to be classified as a metal surface . the cita method , like real corrosion",
    ", amplifies existing differences in material and height ( in this case grayscale value ) so that the biggest contrasts in the original texture image will become more pronounced and smaller contrasts will be nullified .",
    "the eroded mass of ` metal ' by the progression of pitting corrosion at each iteration is used to generate a feature vector that describes the image to be classified .",
    "the effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated on two texture data sets with natural and synthetic textures .",
    "in addition , to verify the robustness of the cita method , its invariance to noise and rotation were tested , obtaining satisfactory results .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : corrosion ] describes the basics behind the pitting corrosion phenomenon , while the definition of a ca as well as further explanation of some parts of this definition form the subject of section  [ sec : automata ] .",
    "the cita method is described in section  [ sec : method ] and the experimental setup needed to test its efficacy is explained in section  [ sec : experiments ] .",
    "section  [ sec : resultsdiscussions ] presents the results and discussion of the study .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "corrosion is the disintegration of metals ( and alloys ) into their constituents due to reaction with the environment and is one of the main causes of structural failure in industrial systems , and poses as such an economic problem  @xcite .",
    "dealing with corrosion is difficult because of its complex nature and the involvement of many variables .",
    "therefore , modeling and simulation could allow for predicting more accurately the corrosion process in time .",
    "ca - based models are excellent candidates for modeling corrosion due to their intrinsic simplicity and therefore , since the beginning of the new millennium , attempts are being made to employ these models in the field of corrosion engineering  @xcite .",
    "corrosion is present in a wide range of metals and environments , which points to the universality of this phenomenon .",
    "the latter suggests that corrosion does not depend on the details of the underlying mechanism , so that it may be modeled adequately using simple models  @xcite .",
    "moreover , ca - based models are able to capture the stochasticity of the involved electrochemical reactions at the mesoscopic scale  @xcite .",
    "pitting corrosion is a very harmful and common form of localized corrosion where all or most of the metal loss occurs concentrated in certain areas . upon close inspection of the metal surface , pitting can be recognized by the appearance of small holes on the metal surface as shown in figure  [ fig : pitschema].the first step in pitting corrosion is the pit initiation which is the result of impurities or irregularities of the metal surface or the environment , making perfectly polished surfaces more resistant to this type of corrosion . from there on , the acidity inside the pit is maintained by the spatial separation of the cathodic and anodic half - reactions , which creates a potential gradient and electromigration of aggressive anions into the pit ( see figure  [ fig : pitschema ] ) . as pit growth progresses",
    ", different solution compositions develop inside the cavity and the consequent voltage ( ir ) drop along the metal / electrolyte interface illustrates that the deeper the pit , the lower the pit growth rate  @xcite .",
    "cas are mathematical constructs in which the space , state and time domains are discrete as opposed to partial differential equations ( pde ) in which these three domains are continuous  @xcite .",
    "the ability of cas to generate a rich spectrum of sometimes complex spatio - temporal patterns from relatively simple underlying transition functions has led to their successful employment in the study of several ( a)biological processes  @xcite .",
    "models based on cas can be seen as an alternative to pde - based models , to provide researchers with a wider range of modeling tools and , in some complex cases , a solution to problems encountered with some of the more classical modeling methods  @xcite .    in this paper , we make use of a homogeneous ca , in which a single transition function , constructed using a combination of knowledge on the pitting corrosion phenomenon and intuition , governs the dynamics of all cells .",
    "the following definition of a homogeneous 2d ca is relied upon .",
    "* definition i*.    ( homogeneous 2d cellular automaton)[def ] + a homogeneous 2d cellular automaton @xmath0 can be represented as @xmath1 where    1 .",

    ", some parts of this definition will be elaborated in the remainder of this section .      in this paper , a finite two - dimensional grid consisting of squares",
    "is used , because it has the most straightforward implementation and provides an easy way of linking the cells of @xmath2 to the pixels of the texture images to be classified ( cfr.infra ) .",
    "furthermore , an indexing of the cells of a 2d ca is introduced , which is shown in figure  [ cellen2d ] . for a square grid",
    ", it holds that @xmath13 = @xmath14 = @xmath15 .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]      many different neighborhoods can be defined in 2d , the two most important ones being the moore and the von neumann neighborhood .",
    "the moore neighborhood of a cell @xmath16 comprises those cells that share at least a vertex with @xmath16 ( see figure  [ moore ] ) .",
    "the von neumann neighborhood is a more restricted neighborhood in which only those cells that share an edge with @xmath16 are considered as neighbors ( see figure  [ neumann ] ) .",
    "every cell @xmath16 has one of the @xmath5 discrete states comprised in the set @xmath4 .",
    "the states of the cells @xmath16 of @xmath2 at @xmath17 , i.e.  @xmath18 , constitute the initial condition of @xmath2 . in this paper , the initial condition of @xmath2 is determined by the grayscale value of the different pixels of the corresponding texture image ( cfr.infra ) .",
    "the transition function @xmath11 determines the state of a cell @xmath16 at the ( @xmath19)-th time step based on the cell s current state and the states of its neighboring cells .",
    "the transition function employed in this paper is executed in a deterministic and synchronous manner , meaning that @xmath11 is used to evaluate the state of every cell of @xmath2 at every time step and for all cells at the same time  @xcite .",
    "the cita method proposed in this paper starts by converting the texture image into the initial state of a ca .",
    "thereafter , a ca - based model inspired by the pitting corrosion phenomenon is evaluated for a number of time steps .",
    "the cumulative mass of corroded metal after each iteration of the ca - based model is used to construct a feature vector for every texture image .",
    "finally , these vectors of characteristics are used to classify the images via lda . in the remainder of this section ,",
    "the cita method is explained in more detail .",
    "a two - dimensional grayscale image is treated as a discrete object and is seen as a grid @xmath2 .",
    "the dimensions of @xmath2 are defined by the size of the image , where each pixel of the image is a cell of the ca .",
    "the original image is then used to determine an initial state of the cells of the ca by converting the gray level image into a discrete initial state for each cell .",
    "thus , for the initial configuration @xmath18 there are 256 possible states , ranging from 0 to 255 .",
    "this conversion is described by    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the original image and @xmath22 represents the gray level of the pixel at the @xmath23-th row and @xmath24-th column of the image @xmath21 . in order to introduce the ideas of pitting corrosion",
    ", the 2d grid will be regarded as a metal surface and the state of each cell will represent the depth of the local pit in the metal ( i.e.  along the third dimension ) , with state 0 meaning that there is no pit and 255 being the largest pit depth of the metal at @xmath25 .",
    "it is important to point out that for @xmath26 the maximum pit depth can exceed 255 and from thereon it is possible that the grid can no longer be represented as a grayscale image .",
    "an important consideration is the choice of boundary conditions in order to obtain an appropriate behavior of the ca - based model .",
    "the two most popular boundary conditions are the periodic and reflecting boundary conditions .",
    "the former tries to simulate an infinite grid , where the new boundaries of the top , bottom , left and right are filled with the values of the opposite side , thus forming a torus in a 3d space .",
    "this boundary condition is useful for simulating systems where the physical boundaries do not play an important role .",
    "however , throughout this paper , reflecting boundaries will be used as they give rise to better results for the studied databases as was observed from preliminary tests .",
    "firstly , an imaginary row at the top and at the bottom of the grid and an imaginary column at the left and at the right of the grid are added .",
    "then , the reflecting boundary conditions are applied at every time step as follows : @xmath27 with @xmath28 the size of the original image with @xmath29 pixels .",
    "the updated state of each cell @xmath16 of @xmath2 at time @xmath30 depends on the analysis of the states of the cells in the neighborhood of @xmath16 at time @xmath9 . in this paper , the moore neighborhood ( see figure  [ moore ] )",
    "is employed .",
    "furthermore , the cita method makes use of a transition function @xmath11 inspired by pitting corrosion . in a first step",
    ", @xmath31 is calculated for every cell @xmath16 as the difference between the state of this cell and the lowest state value within its moore neighborhood ( see eq.([eq : dif ] ) ) :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the set of states of the cells in the moore neighborhood of @xmath16 .",
    "bearing in mind the principles of pitting corrosion , a local ` impurity ' or minimum height difference is needed at a certain location in order to initiate or propagate pitting corrosion . for this purpose ,",
    "a surface roughness parameter @xmath34 is introduced .",
    "all differences lower than this parameter @xmath34 are considered insignificant , i.e. not real impurities , in order to account for the fact that not even a polished metal surface is perfectly smooth .",
    "this means that differences @xmath31 lower than @xmath34 will not give rise to ( further ) pitting . on the other hand ,",
    "the larger the difference grows , the lower the pit growth rate will be due to the ir drop , until finally the pit growth rate becomes zero .",
    "in this paper , it is assumed that if the difference @xmath31 is greater than 254 , the greatest possible difference at @xmath17 , the corresponding pit growth rate is zero .",
    "this means that only the state of those cells with a difference @xmath31 greater than or equal to @xmath34 and smaller than 255 are evaluated .",
    "figures  [ fig : dif1]-[fig : dif3 ] illustrate the selection process to determine whether a cell will be evaluated or not . in this example , @xmath34 is set to five meaning that cells @xmath16 whose state differs less than five with the lowest state in its neighborhood are considered to belong to the surface and will not have their state changed .",
    "figure  [ fig : dif1 ] shows the cells belonging to a @xmath35 square tessellation with their initial state .",
    "figure  [ fig : dif2 ] depicts the difference @xmath31 for each of these cells calculated according to eq.([eq : dif ] ) .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig : dif3 ] the gray cells indicate the cells that are evaluated in that time step , because their @xmath31 is greater than or equal to five and smaller than 255 .    under these assumptions , the transition function @xmath11 establishes the state of a cell @xmath16 at the ( @xmath19)-th time step according to    @xmath36    where @xmath37 $ ] is the pitting power .",
    "this parameter @xmath38 represents the metal - specific resistance to corrosion under given environmental conditions , where @xmath39 stands for completely resistant metal .",
    "further , @xmath40 is a function that employs @xmath31 and @xmath38 to determine the level of corrosion to be applied . in this paper , @xmath40 is defined as    @xmath41    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) , it can be seen that the function @xmath40 gives , depending on the value of @xmath38 , a non - integer output , meaning that the employed model structure is actually a continuous ca or coupled map lattice rather than a ca  @xcite .",
    "however , in order to keep working with a ca - based model and to not overcomplicate the model , the choice was made to limit the output of @xmath40 to integer values ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : t2 ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath42    where @xmath43 in @xmath44 denotes the floor of @xmath43 .",
    "the output of the ca - based model at every time step is the cumulative mass of corroded product . in each iteration , after updating the state of the cells , the mass that suffered corrosion in that iteration is added to the eroded total mass from the previous iteration .",
    "finally , this cumulative corroded mass is expressed relative to the number of pixels of the texture images such that texture images with different sizes can be compared using the cita method .",
    "figure  [ fig : cabased ] shows some examples of initial images and the simulated result after 90 iterations of the pitting - corrosion - inspired ca - based model . in the first column",
    "the original images are shown , the second column shows the simulated output of the ca - based model in grayscale , while the third column displays the same results as the second column , but scaled in a color map where blue indicates the lowest and red the highest resulting values . after simulation , some structural details from the original image can still be retrieved in the simulated output .",
