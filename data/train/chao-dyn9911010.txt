    "invariant manifolds are essential components in the phase space structure of hamiltonian systems . a stable manifold @xmath1 and an unstable manifold @xmath2 of a fixed point ( or a periodic point )",
    "is a set of points which asymptotically go to the fixed point as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "these manifolds are invariant with time and are called invariant manifolds .",
    "suppose we have an integrable hamiltonian system @xmath5 where an unstable manifold is smoothly connected to a stable manifold to form a separatrix .",
    "if we perturb the system as @xmath6 then the system is no longer integrable in general and the unstable manifold and stable manifold do not connect smoothly anymore . rather they intersect transversally and cross each other infinitely many times to produce a complex structure called homoclinic tangle , which eventually gives rise to chaos  @xcite .",
    "hence the intersection of invariant manifolds are quite important as the origin of hamiltonian chaos .    .",
    "the origin o is a hyperbolic fixed point.,width=302 ]    at the point of intersection between @xmath2 and @xmath1 we can define the `` intersection angle '' ( which is also called as a splitting angle ) @xmath7 between these two manifolds . for several important cases it is estimated to be quite small and behave singularly with respect to the maginitude of hyperbolicity @xmath8 of the fixed point  @xcite .",
    "its leading order behavior for @xmath9 is @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constants . for small values of @xmath8",
    "the exponential factor makes the angle @xmath7 extremely small .",
    "recent asymptotic calculation of functional form of invariant manifolds also contain this singular factor  @xcite thus supporting the estimation .    for area preserving mappings",
    ", the area enclosed by an unstable and a stable manifold is equal to the flux from inside to outside ( or from outside to inside ) of the separatrix per one time step . if the intersection angle gets small so does the area .",
    "hence the smallness of the intersection angle is also important in understanding the global dynamics and relaxation process in hamiltonian systems .",
    "the singularly smallness of the intersection angle is , however , not yet confirmed thoroughly .",
    "analytical estimation mentioned above is asymptotic approximation , and since it is asymptotic expression for @xmath14 , we do not know from what value of @xmath8 we can observe the singular behavior .",
    "usually numerical computation can support analytical estimation . however , ordinary numerical computation is useless in this case to check the singular behavior because of limited precision .",
    "suppose we would like to confirm the proportionality of intersection angle as @xmath15 . if @xmath16 the factor is about @xmath17 .",
    "let us write the normalized tangent vector and their components for stable and unstable manifolds as @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively , and the intersection angle as @xmath7 .",
    "then @xmath20 and @xmath21 up to the first order of @xmath7 .",
    "hence if the angle is of the order of @xmath22 then the differences between values of the components of two vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 are far beyond the range of ordinary double precision of 64-bit , where mantissa ( fractional part ) is at most 16 decimal digits .",
    "there are two methods which we may use for problems which require extremely high precision .",
    "one is `` validated computation ''  @xcite and the other is `` multiprecision '' .",
    "`` validated computation '' is a method to obtain _ rigorous _ results with numerical computation .",
    "it is based on operation for intervals rather than for numbers .",
    "usual numerical computation on real numbers says e.g. , @xmath25 , but this just mean that the value of @xmath26 will be near 0.123 and it does not mean that the value of @xmath26 is exactly 0.123 .",
    "on the other hand , with the use of validated computation we can rigorously say that the value of @xmath26 satisfies , for example , @xmath27 .    although validated computation is a powerful tool , it seems not to be all - purpose , and it seems to take time to reformulate the problem one want to solve to fit validated computation .",
    "hence we adopt the second tool , multiprecision library .    in usual numerical computation the precision of variables",
    "are uniquely defined in each implementation of language ( c , fortran , etc . ) . on the other hand ,",
    "using multiprecision library users can define the precision of variables arbitrarily . for various multiprecision tools",
    "see the hfloat web page  @xcite .",
    "here we adopt a multiprecision library called cln  @xcite which can be used in c++ .",
    "the purpose of this paper is ( i ) to numerically confirm the singular dependence of the intersection angle using multiprecision library , ( ii ) to find the range of @xmath8 where the singular dependence appears .",
    "there have been several attempts to numerically compute the singular behavior of the intersection angle . in the paper  @xcite",
    "lazutkin et al .",
    "cites a numerical result by c. sim as private communication and writes that the value of the angle by their analytical estimation is `` in good accordance with numerical data '' .",
    "also in @xcite , amick et al . computed the splitting distance of manifolds for a 4th order map @xmath28 , @xmath29 with ordinary double precision . in this paper",
    ", we give a refined and concrete result for these pioneering work , by performing direct computation with multiprecision ,    this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce symplectic mappings for which we calculate the intersection angles . in section 3",
    "we describe the method of computation , and the result is presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we give summary and discussions .",
    "the first model we use is a `` double - well map '' ; @xmath30 this map has a hyperbolic fixed point at ( 0,0 ) .    for this mapping the intersection angle",
    "is estimated to be  @xcite @xmath31 after change of coordinate ) hence the value of the angle @xmath7 and the prefactor @xmath32 is rescaled appropreately in eq .",
    "( [ eq : angle - double - well ] ) . ] .",
    "the second model is the well - known standard map  @xcite ; @xmath33 this map has hyperbolic fixed points at @xmath34 ( @xmath35 : integer ) . for standard map",
    "the intersection angle is estimated to be  @xcite @xmath36",
    "here we describe the method of calculation of intersection angle for the double well map ( [ eq : dw ] ) . the method for standard map is similar .",
    "in short , we choose two approximate points @xmath37 for an intersection point , and approximate the intersection angle by the ones between the two manifolds which are on @xmath37 .",
    "first we search for an intersection point of @xmath2 and @xmath1 . following an argument similar to @xcite , it is easily shown that one of the intersection",
    "points called principal intersection point ( pip ) is on the @xmath38-axis .",
    "suppose we choose an initial point on @xmath38-axis and update the point backward in time .",
    "if the point is near but not on the stable manifold it will approach to the hyperbolic fixed point and then goes away from it .",
    "the direction the point goes away shows whether the initial point is on the right or left of the true intersection point .",
    "hence we can set an interval on @xmath38-axis which include the intersection point between the stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "then we make the interval narrower by bisection .",
    "we call the final interval as @xmath39 . in actual calculation we set the final width of the interval as @xmath40 and @xmath41 we will use the points @xmath42 and @xmath43 as approximations for the intersection point and denote as @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively",
    ", i.e. , @xmath46      now we are going to make tangent vectors at these approximate points @xmath37 .",
    "although we do not know directly the tangent vectors at @xmath37 , we can calculate them from the linear neighbourhood around the hyperbolic fixed point @xmath47 .",
    "first we update the points @xmath37 forward or backward in time ; @xmath48    where the time steps @xmath49 and @xmath50 are sufficiently large for @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in actual calculation we determined @xmath49 and @xmath50 so that @xmath53 and @xmath54 be the points which are nearest to the hyperbolic fixed point ( 0,0 ) on the orbits @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "since the points @xmath53 and @xmath54 are quite near to the fixed point ( 0,0 ) the map @xmath57 can be approximated by its linearized map ; @xmath58 hence the tangent vector of the manifolds which passes @xmath59 or @xmath60 can be approximated by the invariant curve of the linearized map @xmath61 , that is , hyperbola .",
    "if we denote @xmath62 then the curve @xmath63 is invariant under @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "hence we can obtain the tangent vector @xmath64 and @xmath65 of unstable and stable manifolds as the tangent vector of the hyperbola ( [ eq : hyperbola ] ) @xmath66      the tangent vectors at approximate intersection point @xmath37 is obtained by pulling back the tangent vectors @xmath67 , @xmath68 to the points @xmath37 as @xmath69    approximation values for intersection angle @xmath7 at each approximate intersection point @xmath37 is obtained as @xmath70",
    "now we present the results .",
    "computation is performed on a pentium - ii processor pc with linux operating system ( vine linux 1.0b ) with gnu c / c++ compiler g++ 2.7.2.3 and egcs 1.0.3-release , and the version of multiprecision library is cln 1.0.1 .",
    "the computation time is typically several hundred times longer than ordinary numerical computation with double precision .",

    "note that we apparently have agreement even above the @xmath77 , where the last kam torus is broken and the phase space has global chaotic sea .",

    "the difference in the exponent ( 5.04935 for our numerical result and 5 for @xcite ) is negligible .",

    "hence we have confirmed that the singular small behavior of the intersection angle @xmath89 indeed exists for area preserving mappings .",
    "thus the flux in the phase space is quite small for small values of @xmath8 , which will make the relaxation process quite slow .",
    "in addition , although the analytical estimation is obtained as the asymptotic approximation formula for @xmath90 , our numerical results show that the singular dependence appears from rather large value of @xmath8 .",
    "also we have measured the prefactor of the singular factor , and confirmed that the analytical estimations for prefactors are correct .",
    "exponent of the power law is in almost perfect agreement .",
    "it appears constants in the prefactors slightly differ from the ones in analytical estimation .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that the estimation need to be refined .",
    "for the analytical estimation contains a free parameter called switching function @xmath91 which take a value between 0 and 1@xcite .",
    "although the estimation is given for @xmath92 , @xmath91 can be some other value .",
    "in fact @xcite takes the value @xmath93 when comparing their functional form of unstable manifold with numerically obtained orbit . note that within the range of parameters computed the constant factor do not appear to depend on @xmath8 or @xmath94 .",
    "the singularly smallness of intersection angle was one of several things in the study of hamiltonian chaos which are predicted but not yet confirmed precisely . among others are nekhoroshev bound  @xcite and arnold diffusion  @xcite . in both cases",
