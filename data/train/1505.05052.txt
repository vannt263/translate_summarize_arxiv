    "the question of whether nonlocal variables could be measured instantaneously was considered by no means obvious in the early days of quantum theory .",
    "it was initially thought that , although measurements of local variables presented no problems , the principle of relativistic causality placed severe restrictions upon the measurability of nonlocal operators .",
    "this idea was first proposed by landau and peierls in 1931 @xcite .",
    "they claimed that the measurement of _ any _ nonlocal observable necessarily violated causality and , therefore , indicated the failure of quantum mechanics in the relativistic range .",
    "subsequent generations of physicists , who were less skeptical about the applicability of quantum theory to relativistic problems , concluded that the measurement of nonlocal variables must therefore be impossible .",
    "this was until 1981 , when the first experiment designed specifically to measure a nonlocal property was proposed by aharonov and albert @xcite .",
    "this essay reviews six papers , including the ones mentioned above , written between 1931 and 2003 , which explore questions relating to the instantaneous measurement of nonlocal variables in relativistic quantum theory .",
    "such measurements must be possible if we are to grant nonlocal variables the status of observables .",
    "we conclude that all nonlocal operators _ may _ be measured instantaneously and that , in this sense , the predictions of quantum mechanics are entirely consistent with the requirements of special relativity . however , as we shall demonstrate , the principle of relativistic causality _ does _ place constraints upon the _ way _ in which such measurements may be performed .",
    "the principle of superposition in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics allows the existence of so called nonlocal states for composite systems .",
    "a useful example is a system composed of two fermions . for simplicity we may assume that each fermion is fixed at a point in space , either @xmath0 or @xmath1 ,",
    "for example , by some potential , and consider only the spin part of the total wave function .",
    "the general state space of a composite system is given by the tensor product of the hilbert spaces which form the state spaces of the individual subsystems , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of subsystems . in this case",
    "the appropriate state space is a four - dimensional hilbert space which is the tensor product of the two , two - dimensional , hilbert spaces of the individual particles .",
    "the space is spanned by any four mutually orthogonal state vectors , of which the four direct product states ,    @xmath4    are an obvious example",
    ". however , any four mutually orthogonal states form an equally valid basis . the spectral theorem for self - adjoint operators @xcite states that an operator may be defined entirely in terms of its eigenvectors , @xmath5 where the eigenvalue @xmath6 has degeneracy @xmath7 , of which @xmath8 vectors will be linearly independent .",
    "it is therefore possible to use any set of @xmath9 linearly independent eigenvectors of any hermitian operator as a complete set of mutually orthogonal basis vectors .",
    "however , the eigenstates of a general hermitian operator are degenerate and it is necessary to specify the simultaneous eigenvalues of two or more commuting operators in order to specify a state completely . for example , in our system the direct product states may be rewritten as the simultaneous eigenvectors of the operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 which represent the @xmath12-component of spin for each of the one - particle subsystems ,    @xmath13    in addition to the four direct product states , in which each fermion has either spin @xmath14 , denoted @xmath15 , or spin @xmath16 , denoted @xmath17 , states , there are an infinite number of possible superpositions of these states .",
    "four superpositions of particular interest are the famous bell states @xcite , in which the coefficients of each product term are equal ,    @xmath18    in the two fermion system @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which are represented by the appropriate pauli spin matrix for single particles , are represented by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the identity matrix . in a similar manner , the operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be defined as @xmath24 @xmath25 where    @xmath26    these represent the @xmath12-component and squared magnitude of the total spin vector for the composite system .",
    "it can easily be verified that these operators commute and have eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath27 , @xmath29 , respectively , in our example .",
    "the complete set of their simultaneous eigenvectors therefore forms an alternative basis for the four - dimensional hilbert space , given by    @xmath30    the key point to notice is that it is possible for the two particle system to possess a total spin vector with a squared magnitude of @xmath27 or @xmath31 , and with zero @xmath12-component , when neither of its constituent particles can be said to possess a spin of @xmath32 individually .    _",
    "local variables _ : for pure quantum states",
    ", a local state is an eigenstate of operators representing observables which the system can possess at a fixed point in space .",
    "for example , our second particle may possess a spin value of @xmath33 at @xmath1 .",
    "for the purposes of this essay , which deals only with pure states , such operators are called local operators . by this definition , @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "are local operators and @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , given by eqs .",
    "( [ basis2.a])-([basis2.d ] ) , are local states .",
    "we will see that all local operators may be measured instantaneously , and may therefore be referred to as local observables .    _ nonlocal variables _ : on the other hand , operators such as @xmath22 and a @xmath23 represent variables that are not spatially localised .",
    "these variables will be called nonlocal variables , or nonlocal observables if they can be measured in some way .",
    "these are not strict definitions . in general , for mixed states , direct products exist which are nonlocal . this phenomenon is called nonlocality without entanglement @xcite , but will not be discussed here . as we shall see , although most , but not _ all _ , local variables may be measured easily , the requirements of relativistic causality place certain constraints upon measurements of nonlocal variables .",
    "hence , by this definition , states such as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and other superpositions of direct product states , are referred to as nonlocal as they do not possess values of observables that exist at a specific point in space .",
    "therefore , although local states may be the eigenvectors of both local and nonlocal operators , for example @xmath34 and @xmath35 , nonlocal states may _ not _ be the eigenstates of local operators . in our two - fermion system ,",
    "both @xmath38 and @xmath39 possess values of the total spin vector squared _ and _ its @xmath12-component , as they are the simultaneous eigenvectors of @xmath22 and @xmath23 but , unlike the states @xmath34 to @xmath37 , neither particle possesses a spin individually at each spatial point , @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the states @xmath38 and @xmath39 are therefore _",
    "nonlocal_.    states of this kind are sometimes also referred to as entangled , as the probabilities of results of local measurements made on one subsystem are dependent upon the results of local measurements already made on another subsystem . here",
    ", for example , beginning with either state @xmath40 and measuring @xmath19 at point @xmath0 , at time @xmath41 , causes a collapse of the wave function and will yield the result @xmath32 with equal probability .",
    "the result of a subsequent measurement of @xmath20 at point @xmath1 at @xmath42 will then , with certainty , yield @xmath14 .",
    "thus the two sub - systems are unavoidably  entangled \" in some way .",
    "again , this is not a strict definition , but the example is useful for our purposes , in order to illustrate the idea of entanglement .",
    "formally , an entangled state is a state belonging to the hilbert space of a composite system @xmath43 which may not be written as a direct product of states belonging to the hilbert spaces of the individual subsystems , i.e. @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "all such states belonging to any quantum system exhibit behaviour similar to that outlined above .",
    "it is also worth noting here that nonlocal variables also exist for single particle states .",
    "the most common example is momentum .",
    "momentum eigenstates are superpositions of infinitely many position eigenstates and are therefore nonlocal , although this point is often not emphasized in introductory courses on quantum mechanics .",
    "_ in summary , the nonlocal states considered here are eigenvectors of only nonlocal operators , which represent quantities a system can not posses at a single point in space . _      it was realised , very early on in the development of quantum mechanics that some superposition states possessed values of nonlocal variables , and that operators representing these variables could be mathematically constructed .",
    "it was also possible , to some extent , to measure the value of certain nonlocal variables .",
    "this could be done by using an ensemble of many copies of identically prepared systems and performing repeated local measurements .",
    "for example , in our system , if measurements of @xmath19 and @xmath20 were performed on one thousand copies of identically prepared states and it was found that @xmath47 and @xmath48 approximately five hundred times , while @xmath49 and @xmath50 approximately five hundred times , we would know that the original state was either @xmath51 or @xmath52 , and so that the value of @xmath22 is zero . however , we would be unable to specify exactly which state was initially present , and hence unable to determine @xmath23 .",
    "this method suffers from three defects .",
    "firstly , it is by no means obvious that it may be used to determine the value of a general nonlocal variable .",
    "secondly , it is not instantaneous , by which we mean that the measurement can not be completed at a specific instant in time and , thirdly , it destroys the state which we were initially interested in , though it may be recreated later using the same preparation which gave rise the the original ensemble . as stated in the introduction , it was , in fact , highly uncertain until the early 1980 s @xcite , whether instantaneous measurements of _ any _ nonlocal variables were physically possible .",
    "although it was commonly accepted that nonlocal variables existed , and the operators representing some such variables were well known , it was by no means clear in the early days of quantum theory whether any nonlocal property besides momentum @xmath53 , and operators of the form @xmath54 , could ever be measured instantaneously in the conventional von neumann @xcite sense .",
    "in fact , as early as 1931 landau and peierls @xcite claimed that _ no _ nonlocal variables , not even momentum , could be measured instantaneously in the relativistic range .",
    "however , there arguments were unclear .",
    "they used the uncertainty relation @xmath55 , which is obtained by inserting the de broglie relation @xmath56 into the bandwidth theorem from the classical theory of waves , and considered the energy of interaction between the system and the measuring device .",
    "they thereby obtained the relation @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 supposedly represent the velocities of the particle before and after the measurement , in the nonrelativistic range .",
    "they then substituted @xmath60 , in accordance with relativistic causality , to obtain @xmath61 , which may also be obtained by substituting @xmath62 for a relativistic particle into @xmath55 .",
    "landau and peierls argued that , as @xmath63 may be made arbitrarily large in nonrelativistic quantum theory , the value of @xmath64 could be determined precisely .",
    "they therefore claimed that , in the relativistic regime ,  the concept of momentum has a precise significance only over long times \" and that similar arguments applied to other nonlocal properties . in effect",
    "they claimed that no instantaneous measurement of a nonlocal variable was possible in relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "however , this idea seems to have rested upon a misinterpretation of their own equation . in the relation @xmath55",
    ", the @xmath65 refers to the temporal extent of a wave packet describing the state of a system . in the relativistic regime , this is given by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the spatial extent , or width .",
    "for example , if @xmath65 is the temporal extent of a photon pulse from a laser , then @xmath68 is the statistical spread in the observed energies of the individual photons detected .",
    "equivalently , @xmath65 is the statistical spread in the observed times at which the individual photons reach the detector .",
    "similar arguments apply to other quantum mechanical particles . under no circumstances",
    "is @xmath65 the  time taken to perform a measurement of e \" , as claimed in @xcite , or is @xmath68 the  uncertainty in a possessed value of e \" . in all measurements of energy , at all times , the system can be said to possess a particular value of @xmath69 at that particular time .",
    "this was in fact noted by landau and peierls in an earlier section of the same paper and the correct interpretation was attributed , by them , to bohr @xcite .",
    "it is therefore odd that they should have seemed to consider @xmath65 as the time taken to perform a measurement , and @xmath70 as the corresponding uncertainty in the _ possessed _ value of @xmath64 , when considering the relativistic range .",
    "it is also true that they considered the system as _ necessarily _ possessing a momentum @xmath71 before the momentum measurement , as well as a momentum @xmath64 after the measurement , when deriving the formula for the nonrelativistic case .",
    "this is also at odds with the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics , although the formula for the relativistic range , @xmath61 , remains valid .",
    "in any event it was , until recently , by no means clear whether any instantaneous measurements of nonlocal variables , excluding functions of @xmath64 , were possible , although it was generally , tacitly , assumed that they were not .",
    "that was until 1981 when yakir aharonov of tel aviv university and david z. albert of the rockefeller university in new york proposed the first experiment designed specifically to measure a nonlocal property of a composite system @xcite .",
    "for simplicity aharonov and albert considered the two part system discussed in the previous section as an example of how to perform a measurement of a nonlocal variable without violating causality .",
    "they designed an experiment to measure @xmath22 , the @xmath12-component of the total spin of one of the maximally entangled bell states , @xmath51 or @xmath52 , without measuring either @xmath10 or @xmath11 individually .",
    "they referred to this as a nondemolition experiment , as it left the nonlocal state intact and did not trigger the reduction of the state vector , which would involve the loss on the nonlocal property .",
    "the general idea was to get the nonlocal variable of the entangled system to couple to local variables at different parts of the measuring apparatus .",
    "the results of these local measurements could then be combined via classical information transfer to reveal the value of the nonlocal property without violating causality or causing state vector reduction .",
    "aharonov and albert first considered a piece of apparatus designed to measure the @xmath12-component of the spin of a single particle , say @xmath10 .",
    "the device interacts with the one - particle system over a short period via the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath72 where @xmath73 represents the coupling between the device and the system , and is nonzero only during the interval @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is an internal variable associated with the measuring device .",
    "the particle then gains momentum @xmath76 , which is the momentum canonically conjugate to @xmath77 , given via @xmath78 the simplest and most common example of such a device is the stern - gerlach apparatus , which can be used to measure the @xmath12-component of spin for charged particles such as electrons . in this case , the coupling @xmath79 is produced by the magnetic field , the internal variable @xmath77 is the @xmath12-component of the electron position and the momentum @xmath76 , conjugate to @xmath77 , is the momentum that the electron acquires in the @xmath12-direction .    for a two particle system , using two such devices to perform simultaneous measurements at @xmath0 and @xmath1 would measure @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , necessarily causing the collapse of an entangled state",
    "however , it is possible to modify the design of the measurement process in the individual devices in such a way that the interaction hamiltonian retains the same form , but which allows the initial states of the two devices to be correlated .",
    "such devices may then be used to perform a measurement of a nonlocal variable on the entangled two - particle state .",
    "we may use our stern - gerlach devices , each together with an additional ancillary electron , initially with spin up , to measure the individual spins of two particles in a slightly more complicated way .",
    "the coupling between the device and the particle is now the controlled not ( or cnot ) , coupling between the electron whose spin we wish to determine , which acts as the control , and the ancillary electron , which acts as the target .",
    "if the control electron initially had spin up , then the ancillary electron remains in the up state , and if the control electron originally had spin down , the spin of the ancillary electron will flip to down . the spin measurement in the sten - gerlach apparatus is then performed on the ancillary electron , from which we are able to infer the spin of the original control .    again , this more complicated experiment may be used to determine the values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 individually .",
    "however , if the two modified stern - gerlach devices are first brought together so that the two ancillary electrons are allowed to interact and become entangled , it is possible to prepare the devices in an initial state so that ,    @xmath80    rearranging equations ( [ h_inta ] ) and ( [ pi_a ] ) we see that , @xmath81 and that an analogous expression holds for @xmath11 .",
    "the two devices are again placed at @xmath0 and @xmath1 but are now effectively one measuring device which acts on the two particle system via the interaction hamiltonian @xmath82 if @xmath83 . in addition , @xmath75 will be equal to @xmath84 at all times if their initial values are equal , according to eq .",
    "( [ pi.b ] ) , and the couplings @xmath73 and @xmath85 are equal , so that the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath86 where @xmath74 , in accordance with eqs .",
    "( [ pi.b ] ) and ( [ spina ] ) .",
    "the apparatus has therefore measured the value of the nonlocal variable @xmath22 , where @xmath87 without determining either @xmath10 or @xmath11 individually , and so without destroying the nonlocal state .",
    "furthermore , relativistic causality is not violated as the conjugate momentums of the two ancillary electrons , given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 are measured using only local interactions .",
    "although the result given by the macroscopic part of one of the measuring devices , say that at @xmath0 , such as the position of the pointer or dials that records the conjugate momentum and spin of the ancillary electron , depend upon which state the ancillary wave function has collapsed to , it is not _ causally _ dependent upon the result obtained at @xmath1 because the dial at @xmath1 will read @xmath32 , randomly .",
    "it is also worth noting that @xmath90 may be made arbitrarily small , so that each local interaction is effectively instantaneous , and that the instantaneous measurements of @xmath76 and @xmath91 need not be simultaneous .",
    "it can be shown that if @xmath76 is recorded at time @xmath92 and @xmath91 at @xmath93 , then , during the interval between the two measurements , the system will not be in an eigenstate of any operator .",
    "in fact , the full state will not be any direct product of a state of the two - particle system and a state of the apparatus .",
    "the second interaction at @xmath1 then  undoes \" the disturbance caused by the first interaction and restores the initial nonlocal state of the system together with some _ new _ local state of the apparatus in which the value of a nonlocal property is encoded .",
    "although a finite amount of time is required to combine the results of the local measurements , the measurement itself is instantaneous as the value of @xmath22 becomes encoded in the local properties of the apparatus immediately after the final interaction .",
    "this is true in any inertial frame , regardless of which interaction the observer sees _",
    "first_.    the experimental probabilities are therefore , remarkably , completely lorentz invariant , despite the non invariance of the state history under lorentz boosts .",
    "this led aharonov and albert to the conjecture that  the covariance of relativistic quantum theories resides _ exclusively _ in the experimental probabilities and not in the underlying quantum states \" @xcite .",
    "aharonov and albert also produced a number of other interesting results regarding causal measurements of non - local variables in their 1981 paper .",
    "in addition to the experiment outlined above they also proposed what they called a _ state specific verification measurement _ to verify the value of @xmath23 _ if _",
    "@xmath94 , or , in other words , to verify that the state of the system is @xmath95 .",
    "this type of measurement is more limited than a measurement of @xmath23 in the usual sense , which aharonov and albert called an _ operator specific _ measurement , in that , if @xmath96 , the interaction destroys the initial state and we are unable to determine what value of @xmath23 it originally possessed .",
    "it is possible to design a state verification measurement for @xmath39 by noting that the state is completely specified by @xmath97 in our bipartite system .",
    "equivalently ,    @xmath98    we may then construct a measuring device which will interact with the system via the hamiltonian @xmath99 this may be done using three sets of stern - gerlach equipment and three pairs of ancillary electrons in a manner analogous to that outlined previously .",
    "the devices may then be prepared so that ,    @xmath100    for each of the three stern - gerlach ancillary electron pairs . using equations ( [ qaqb])-([piapib ] )",

    "therefore , performing the _ operator specific nondemolition experiment _ to measure the value of @xmath107 , we obtain @xmath108 if our state is one of the maximally entangled bell states .",
    "if this is followed by a _ state specific verification experiment _ for @xmath39 , we may determine the value of @xmath109 to be either @xmath27 or @xmath110 .",
    "we have , therefore , effectively measured the values of two nonlocal variables although , in the later case when @xmath111 , the initial state is destroyed .    in any event , aharonov and albert s thought experiment showed conclusively that at least some nonlocal properties of physical systems can be measured in relativistic quantum theory .",
    "this was a tremendous breakthrough which took half a century to be realised .",
    "however , it naturally raised many important questions .",
    "for our example system the obvious question is  is it possible to verify _ every _ linear combination of the local states @xmath34-@xmath37 ? \" .",
    "this question was also considered in their 1981 paper and it was found that an arbitrary state of the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are arbitrary complex coefficients , could _ not _ be verified instantaneously by means of a nondemolition experiment like the ones proposed without violating causality .",
    "this was established by means of a specific counter example , considering the state @xmath115 it was shown that any instantaneous nondemolition experiment distinguishing between @xmath116 and a perpendicular state @xmath117 must necessarily violate causality unless @xmath118 took the particular values @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "aharonov and albert showed that any experiment capable of distinguishing between @xmath116 and @xmath121 necessarily involves the measurement of some observable @xmath122 of which @xmath116 is an eigenstate @xmath123 , and for which any eigenstate degenerate with @xmath116 is orthogonal to @xmath121 .",
    "they then proposed the following two scenarios .",
    "+   + _ scenario ( 1 ) _",
    "* @xmath124 , the system is initially prepared in state @xmath39 , ( @xmath125 ) * @xmath41 , a measurement of the variable @xmath122 is made * @xmath42 , a local measurement of one of the fermion spins , say @xmath126 , is performed    _ scenario ( 2 ) _    * @xmath124 , the system is initially prepared in state @xmath39 , ( @xmath125 ) * @xmath127 , the state of the system is changed from @xmath39 to @xmath38 , for example by rotating the @xmath12-spin of the particle at @xmath0 using a magnetic field * @xmath41 , a measurement of the variable @xmath122 is made * @xmath42 , a local measurement of @xmath126 is made .",
    "it is straightforward , but time consuming , to show that the probabilities of obtaining @xmath128 for scenarios ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are given by    @xmath129^{\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\label { } \\\\   & p^{(2)}\\left(\\hat{\\sigma}_z^{(b)}=+\\hbar/2\\right ) =   \\left[(1 + 2\\sin\\phi \\cos\\phi)\\cos^2\\phi+(1 - 2\\sin\\phi \\cos\\phi)\\sin^2\\phi + \\eta\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    respectively , where @xmath130 is a function of the eulerian angles of @xmath122 .",
    "the proof shall therefore be omitted here and the interested reader is referred to @xcite .",

    "causality therefore requires that , @xmath133 or , in other words , @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "thus the work of aharonov and albert in 1981 , although groundbreaking , left open two important questions ,    1 .",
    "_ what is the largest class of nonlocal states whose nonlocal properties may be verified by means of nondemolition experiments like the ones outlined above ? _ 2 .   _",
    "are there any other forms of measurement , nondemolition or otherwise , by which a larger class of nonlocal variables can be measured ? _    it was therefore necessary in subsequent work to consider carefully what was meant by the term  measurement \" . the rest of this essay is devoted mainly to considering the results of four important papers which , following on from aharonov and albert s original discoveries , attempt to answer the questions above @xcite .",
    "the first of these , written by aharonov and albert together with lev vaidman , also of tel aviv university , was published in 1986 @xcite .",
    "this generalised their earlier results to composite systems of an arbitrary number of subsystems and succeeded in establishing exactly what classes of nonlocal operators could be measured by means of nondemolition experiments involving only local interactions .",
    "these results were then used to show what classes of nonlocal states were verifiable by such procedures .",
    "the 1986 paper by aharonov , albert and vaidman @xcite considered a general composite quantum system composed of an arbitrary number , @xmath3 , of spatially separated subsystems , as shown in fig . 1 .    [ mr ]    it was assumed that any operator @xmath134 , representing a local property of one of the subsystems , could be measured , and an experiment to measure any nonlocal operator of the form @xmath135 was devised . for a general composite system the measuring device consists of @xmath3 spatially separate parts , each of which interacts with the system via the hamiltonian , @xmath136 the composite device is then interacts via the hamiltonian @xmath137 and is prepared in the initial state given by    @xmath138    by analogy with the simpler @xmath139 case .",

    "a nondemolition verification of a nonlocal state @xmath169 involves _ enough _ nondemolition measurements of nonlocal variables to _ specify _ @xmath169 . using only the types of nondemolition experiments considered so far , it is possible to show that , for composite systems of @xmath170 , @xmath171-dimensional , subsystems , only states of the form @xmath172 may be measured .",

    "this step , in conjunction with the first two , therefore demonstrates that _ only _ nonlocal states that have canonical form , in which all the coefficients are equal , may be verified by the methods considered so far .",
    "we now outline the essential details of the proof given in @xcite .",
    "+   + _ stage ( 1 ) _ : the proof is quite straightforward but , for brevity",
    ". we will assume that any nonlocal state may be written in canonical form , and concern ourselves with the last two propositions .",
    "_ stage ( 2 ) _ :",
    "we may verify a nonlocal state of the form ( [ phicanon ] ) by a measurement procedure in two stages .",
    "the first stage consists of @xmath176 measurements which verify that the sum of two local operators , @xmath177 and @xmath178 , is @xmath179 , where @xmath177 and @xmath178 are given by    @xmath180    this is equivalent to verifying that the state @xmath169 has canonical form in _ some _ basis , without specifying the values of the coefficients @xmath175 . in the second stage",
    "we start by defining a set of unitary operators @xmath181 , @xmath182 , which act in every local subsystem such that ,    @xmath183    and which therefore satisfy @xmath184 then , by defining another set of local operators @xmath185 , @xmath182 , where @xmath186 we see that ( [ prodinvar ] ) is equivalent to @xmath187mod(2\\pi ) = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which we are able to verify as shown above .",
    "this completes the second stage of the proof . the third part of the proof is more complicated and ,",
    "for simplicity , we will consider the case of a bipartite system in detail , before stating the general result .",
    "+   + _ stage ( 3 ) _ : it can be shown that , in order to be verified without violating causality , our state @xmath169 must be of the form @xmath188 where @xmath189 is one of the degenerate eigenstates of the nonlocal operator we wish to measure .",
    "if this is not the case it is possible send information at superluminal speeds between the two parts of the system .",
    "this may be illustrated by the following procedure .",
    "first , suppose we have three sets of eigenstates of a nonlocal operator @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 , which are degenerate with each other , and assume that there is a fourth , @xmath193 , which is _ not _ degenerate with the rest",
    ". then the procedure is    * @xmath194 , prepare subsystem two in state @xmath195 , @xmath196 * @xmath127 , prepare subsystem one in state @xmath197 or @xmath198 * @xmath41 , perform a measurement of the nonlocal variable * @xmath42 , perform a local verification measurement of state @xmath199    if at @xmath127 , we prepare @xmath197 then the measurement of the nonlocal variable at @xmath41 will not change the state @xmath199 and the result of the state verification at @xmath127 will be  yes \" with probability @xmath200 .",
    "this is because @xmath201 is also an eigenstate of the nonlocal operator and so @xmath199 will not be disturbed .",
    "if , on the other hand , at @xmath127 we prepare @xmath198 the composite state will be given by @xmath202 which is not an eigenstate of the nonlocal operator .",
    "thus , the measurement at @xmath42 will disturb the state and reveal either @xmath203 or @xmath204 with probabilities @xmath205 and @xmath206 , respectively .",
    "it is therefore possible for local interactions in subsystem one to affect the probabilities of results of local measurements of subsystem two at time @xmath207 later . as @xmath208 , causality is violated .",
    "the matrix elements of equation ( [ phi ] ) are therefore nonzero if and only if the state @xmath189 is degenerate and the measurement of our nonlocal operator is equivalent to a verification that the matrix @xmath209 may be written in block diagonal form , @xmath210,\\ ] ] where @xmath211 is equal to the number of degenerate eigenstates , by reordering the local basis vectors appropriately .",
    "we also know that the state @xmath169 may be written in canonical form ( [ phicanon ] ) where the matrix @xmath212 is nonsingular . by equating these two results",
    "we obtain , @xmath213 which is equivalent to stating that @xmath209 is also nonsingular and diagonal , and may therefore be expressed in the form @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath215 are unitary matrices representing rotations of the local basis .",
    "stage ( 3 ) of the proof is the concluded by considering the density matrices in each local subsystem ,    @xmath216    which are therefore diagonal such that @xmath217 however , the set of characteristic values @xmath218 of any matrix is basis independent and so may be identified with @xmath219 in one of three ways ;    1 .",
    "if all @xmath220 are distinct , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the set of eigenvalues @xmath219 and the set of local eigenvectors @xmath221 ( or @xmath222 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath169 has canonical form for only one set of basis eigenstates . in this case , all that a nondemolition experiment can verify is the basis in which @xmath169 has canonical form . 2 .",
    "some @xmath220 are equal .",
    "this allows us to verify the basis in which @xmath169 has canonical form _ and _ to specify the relative phases between different sets of @xmath223 with equal magnitudes .",
    "if _ all _ @xmath224 are equal we may specify the phases of all @xmath225 , find the value of @xmath220 from normalisation and , consequently , specify the state completely .",
    "we have at last shown that _ only _ nonlocal states which can brought into canonical form with equal coefficients ( [ states ] ) may be verified using nondemolition measurements of nonlocal operators which are of the general kind developed by aharonov , albert and vaidman . assuming these to be the _ only _ kinds of measurements that are possible without violating causality , as _ was _",
    "assumed by the authors themselves in 1985 , it would be true to say that _ only _ nonlocal operators of the form ( [ class1 ] ) , ( [ class2 ] ) or ( [ class3 ] ) could be granted the status of observables in a relativistic theory , and that only states of the form ( [ states ] ) could be verified by the their measurement .",
    "however , sixteen years later berry groisman and benni reznik @xcite , also of tel aviv university , showed that the physical role of measurement in quantum mechanics need not be as restricted as the _ ideal measurements of the first kind _ proposed by von neumann @xcite and the early pioneers of the theory .",
    "they concluded that , if a measurement is not necessarily required to prepare the system in an eigenstate of the corresponding operator , a large number of observables , previously excluded on the grounds of causality violation , become measurable .",
    "this work , in turn , drew on the results of a paper published in 1994 by lev vaidman and sandu popescu of the university of brussels @xcite .",
    "the paper proved two important theorems which hold true for _ any _ measurement of a nonlocal variable which is required to be consistent with relativistic causality .",
    "we will now briefly consider these two theorems .",
    "popescu and vaidman considered the following general scheme for a bipartite system ,    * @xmath194 , prepare the nonlocal state @xmath169 * @xmath127 , local interaction at subsystem @xmath226 described by the unitary transformation @xmath227 * @xmath41 , perform a state verification measurement on @xmath169 * @xmath42 , perform a measurement of a local operator @xmath228 on subsystem @xmath200 .",
    "they assumed as little as possible about the way in which the nonlocal measurement could be carried out .",
    "in particular they did not specify that the measurement should be nondemolition and , in fact , assumed nothing about the final state of the system following the measurement .",
    "nor did they assume only local interactions between the system and the measuring device , as aharonov and albert had .",
    "instead they considered only that the system should undergo unitary time evolution during the interaction .",
    "their results therefore describe completely _ general _ properties of the measurements of nonlocal variables .    the definition of state the verification measurement they adopted may be summarised as follows ; if the measurement is to verify whether @xmath229 , then the result of the experiment is  yes \" if @xmath229 and  no \" if @xmath230 , a state orthogonal to @xmath231 . if , in general , the state of the system is described by @xmath232 the result will be  yes \" or  no \" with probabilities @xmath205 and @xmath206 , respectively .",
    "the state @xmath233 may then be written in canonical form @xmath234 for some basis , where @xmath221 and @xmath222 span the subspaces @xmath235 and @xmath236 .    in order to state the two theorems",
    "it is also convenient to rewrite the causality condition in a more compact form using the notation , @xmath237 where @xmath238 represents the probability of getting the result @xmath158 for the measurement of @xmath228 at @xmath42 , given that the state @xmath169 was prepared initially at @xmath239 and a nonlocal verification measurement was carried out at @xmath240 .",
    "causality then requires that the probability of getting the result @xmath158 must be independent of local interactions at subsystem @xmath226 according to the equation @xmath241 if the state of the system is described by ( [ psi ] ) and the initial state of the measuring device is given by @xmath242 , we may rewrite ( [ causal ] ) as @xmath243 where @xmath244 describes the unitary evolution during the nonlocal verification and @xmath245 is the standard projection operator onto the states with eigenvalue a in subsystem @xmath200 .",

    "the demonstration is straightforward , but will omitted here for the sake of brevity and we refer the interested reader to @xcite .",
    "we may therefore move on to the proof of theorem @xmath226 .",
    "+   + now using ( [ psi * ] ) instead of ( [ psi ] ) and following a procedure analogous to that used to obtain equation ( [ long ] ) above we see that , @xmath292 the last two terms of ( [ long * ] ) are complex conjugates of each other and so to prove theorem @xmath226 we need only show that one or other of them is equal to zero .",

    "thus @xmath299 is orthogonal to @xmath233 and each term in the right hand side of ( [ complex ] ) vanishes .",
    "_ physical significance of theorems 1 and 2 : _ the consequence of these theorems is that local information about the part of the initial state that lies in @xmath251 in necessarily erased .",
    "this is therefore an unavoidable feature of any verification measurement of a nonlocal state .",
    "this was thought to have profound implications for the measurability of operators in relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , the measurement of an operator @xmath300 may be seen as a verification measurement of each of its nondegenerate eigenstates .",
    "it follows from theorems 1 and 2 that the final state of the system after a measurement of @xmath300 must be locally independent of its initial state .",
    "in addition , in accordance with the standard interpretation of the postulates of quantum mechanics , if the initial state is an eigenstate of @xmath300 then it should remain undisturbed by the measurement .",
    "this is an important point .",
    "although vaidman and popescu did not assume that their state verification measurement necessarily left the state undisturbed , they considered that the measurability of an individual variable @xmath301 , which may be seen here as equivalent to the measurability of a collection of state verifications , depended on the eigenstates of the operator @xmath300 remaining invariant during the measurement process . applying this assumption , in conjunction with theorems 1 and 2 , to the simplest nonlocal system , our two- fermion spin - state system , it is easy to  prove \" that many operators are not causally measurable .",
    "in fact , as we will later see , all operators which represent physical values ( local or nonlocal ) possessed by the system _ are _ measurable .",
    "however , theorems 1 and 2 restrict the way in which these variables may be measured .",
    "in particular , certain projective measurements _ do _ violate causality , and are therefore deemed unphysical .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath302 is the projection onto the subspace of entangled states @xmath303 where these may represent an _",
    "arbitrary _ entangled state by appropriate choice of local basis .",
    "now , @xmath304 and @xmath305 are both eigenstates of @xmath302 corresponding to the eigenvalue zero and so are not disturbed by the measurement .",
    "consequently the state will end in either @xmath304 or @xmath305 which are locally indistinguishable .",
    "however , according to theorem 1 , all local information is erased , which leads to a contradiction .",
    "the implication is then that @xmath302 is unmeasurable .",
    "similar arguments imply that only operators with nonlocal eigenstates which are maximally entangled are causally measurable .",
    "if a general entangled state ( [ entangled ] ) is an eigenstate of @xmath300 then , by theorem 1 , the eigenstates of @xmath300 must be locally indistinguishable , which is only the case if @xmath306 .",
    "a more disturbing aspect of these assumptions is that even some operators with eigenstates which are local states , are apparently not causally measurable .",
    "in fact , so called _ ideal measurements _ of operators whose eigenstates are combinations of direct products of spin states aligned along two or three independent axis , say @xmath12,@xmath307 and @xmath308 , violate causality .    at first sight",
    "it may seem that we have therefore finally answered question ( 2 ) of sect .",
    "[ sectiv.4 ] and , furthermore , that we have answered it in the negative .",
    "aharonov and albert claimed that only maximally entangled states were causally verifiable because they were the only nonlocal states verifiable using their original methods , and they did not , at that time , propose any others . here",
    "it may seem that we have shown this result is true for _ any _ verification procedure .",
    "but , in this last analysis , the additional assumption that operator measurements in quantum theory must be _ ideal measurements of the first kind _ has crept in .",
    "we may now see that , if the requirement that the measurement of an observable must prepare the system in an eigenstate of that observable is dropped , then a much wider class of nonlocal variables may be measured causally in accordance with theorems 1 and 2 , which are concerned with the erasing of local information .",
    "groisman and reznik pointed out that quantum measurements play a dual role .",
    "the first is to allow us to observe the value of an unknown quantity , and the second is to prepare the system in a particular state .",
    "they argued that the roles of observation and preparation are , in fact , logically independent .",
    "the measurement technique they developed is based on the idea of _ remote operations _",

    "they showed that , using this method , the class of causally measurable nonlocal operators could be greatly extended .",
    "in particular they showed that _ all _ hermitian operators for a @xmath309-dimensional hilbert space are in fact measurable .",
    "the procedure follows the same general two stage protocol as the instantaneous measurements devised by aharonov and albert .",

    "@xcite which maps a locally unmeasurable set of eigenstates to a locally measurable set .",

    "one set of states to another .",

    "in addition we see that all local information about the initial state of the system is necessarily erased , in accordance with theorems @xmath200 and @xmath226 from popescu and vaidman @xcite . with appropriate modifications this procedure",
    "can also be used to measure operators whose eigenstates are the general @xmath313 product basis .",
    "that is , when the coefficients @xmath347 in equations ( [ 3 * ] ) and ( [ 4 * ] ) are replaced by @xmath348 and @xmath349 , respectively . here",
    "the procedure is necessarily more complicated as we succeed in obtaining the rotation ( [ condrot ] ) only with probability @xmath350 . with probability @xmath350",
    "we also obtain the alternative , less useful map @xmath351 however , if bob measures @xmath352 he knows that the map ( [ condrot ] ) occurred and that the experiment was successful . on the other hand",
    "if he measures @xmath353 , he and alice may utilise a further entangled pair to perform an additional rotation by angle @xmath212 , which again gives the  correct \" map ( [ condrot ] ) with probability @xmath350 , and so on .",
    "the total probability for success is then @xmath354 , which converges to one as the number of trials goes to infinity .",
    "however , if the rotation @xmath212 is chosen such that @xmath355 , the @xmath356 step will always succeed .",
    "perhaps most importantly , groisman and reznik also showed that , by appropriate choices of local measurements and unitary operations , the remote transfer method allows any nonlocal operator of a @xmath309-dimensional hilbert space with eigenvectors which are _ arbitrary nonmaximally entangled states _ to be measured . in effect",
    "this last result implies that _ any _ arbitrary @xmath309-dimensional operator may be measured instantaneously without violating causality , and may therefore be granted the status of an observable .    with this result in mind",
    ", it would perhaps seem strange if arbitrary operators of higher dimensional hilbert spaces were unmeasurable .",
    "later that year it was indeed shown that a measurement procedure involving _ partial _ quantum teleportation permitted the instantaneous measurement of any nonlocal operator belonging to a hilbert space of arbitrary dimension @xcite .",
    "the technique of quantum teleportation @xcite is well documented and we will not consider it in detail here . instead we shall only consider how _ part _ of the teleportation process may be utilised to perform instantaneous measurements of nonlocal variables .",
    "quantum teleportation itself is not instantaneous , as it relies on classical information transfer during an intermediate stage of the teleportation process .",
    "vaidman s great breakthrough was to realise that performing a _ partial teleportation _",
    ", where our second observer bob transfers his state to alice via a bell measurement , but does not tell her the result , preserves the quantum states along each axis .",
    "alice then carries out local measurements independently of bob and combining the results via classical information transfer at the end of the process completes the measurement of the nonlocal variable .",
    "as an example , consider the measurement of a nonlocal operator in our two particle system whose eigenstates are direct products of spin states aligned along different axis , i.e. the @xmath313 twisted product basis ( [ 1*])-([4 * ] ) .",
    "standard projective / von neumann measurements of these operators were found by sandu and popescu to contradict causality , although groisman and reznik s technique rendered them measurable ( c.f . sects .",
    "[ sectvi.2 ] and [ sectvii ] ) . here",
    "we show how to measure operators of this form with the aid of _ partial teleportation_.    in our two particle system it is necessary that alice and bob must share the maximally entangled two - particle state , or _",
    "singlet _ state @xmath357 , and that their friend collin allows them to utilise a third system @xmath358 which he has prepared in an arbitrary state @xmath359 .",
    "the teleportation procedure is based on the identity below , so that a measurement by bob in the bell basis collapses the joint @xmath360 wave function to one of the terms on the right hand side of the equation @xmath361 where    @xmath362    and @xmath363 denotes a rotation of @xmath169 by @xmath364 about the @xmath365 axis , thereby effectively transferring bob s state to alice .    the key step in measuring",
    "a nonlocal variable is then a local measurement of @xmath330 by alice , which she may carry out at any time , independently of bob .",
    "if the result is @xmath366 , this is equivalent to measuring @xmath343 at bob s site , and if the result is @xmath367 it is equivalent to measuring @xmath368 . combining the results of their local measurements alice and bob ( and collin ) are then able to distinguish unambiguously between the four eigenstates ( [ 1*])-([4 * ] ) . with appropriate modifications it is , in principle possible , to use this technique to measure all nonlocal operators acting on a @xmath369-dimensional hilbert space , which confirms groisman and reznik s conclusion that all such operators may be granted the status of observables in a relativistic quantum theory .",
    "however , the most important aspect of this technique is that it may also be extended to measure _ any _ arbitrary function @xmath370 of @xmath3 local observables @xmath371 .",
    "that is , in principle , it may be used to measure any nonlocal variable of a composite quantum system , even if the subsystems @xmath372 are space - like separated and @xmath3 is arbitrarily large .",
    "again , local information about the initial state of the system is erased in accordance with popescu and vaidman s results @xcite .",
    "the general protocol for the measurement of an arbitrary nonlocal operator in the two particle system @xmath373 was set out in detail by vaidman in his 2003 paper @xcite .",
    "the process is complicated and consists of four individual steps , each performed in a number of teleportation  rounds \" ( from now on we will use the term teleportation to mean partial teleportation in the sense explained above ) .",
    "each successive round requires the utilisation of increasing numbers of teleportation channels , that is of increasing numbers of  collins \" and shared entangled pairs .",
    "however , by considering the two - particle case it is relatively easy to see how the procedure may be continued for three , four , five . .",
    "subsystems , and it is therefore illustrative for us to consider it in detail .",
    "firstly , alice and bob swap the states of their systems with the states of @xmath171 spin-@xmath350 particles using teleportation .",
    "the protocol is then as follows . +   +    1 .",
    "bob teleports the state of his system ( which is equivalent to the states of @xmath171 spin-@xmath350 particles ) to alice and records the outcomes of the associated bell measurements .",
    "the number of possible outcomes is @xmath374 which bob indexes by the variable @xmath375 , where @xmath376 corresponds to measuring singlets in all bell measurements and indicates that bob s state has been successfully teleported without distortion .",
    "alice performs a unitary operation on the composite system of herself and the teleported spins .",
    "if undistorted teleportation has occurred this operation transforms the eigenstates of @xmath373 , which are now all at alice s site , to product states of the @xmath12-component of spin .",
    "alice teleports the complete system of @xmath377 spin-@xmath350 particles to bob .",
    "4 .   if undistorted teleportation has occurred @xmath378 , bob now measures the teleported system in the @xmath12-basis and his local spin measurement in the @xmath12-basis completes the measurement of @xmath373 .",
    "+ however , the probability of obtaining singlet states in all bell measurements , that is of obtaining teleportation without distortion , is @xmath379 and so the measurement will only  succeed \" on the fourth step one in @xmath3 times .",
    "_ round 2 _    1 .",
    "if @xmath380 , bob teleports the system back to alice and again records the outcomes of the associated bell measurements , which he indexes with the variable @xmath381 where @xmath382 . in this case bob must also  tell \" alice the outcomes of his previous bell measurements @xmath383 via the same teleportation channel .",
    "alice can then perform unitary operations which consist of her original transformations from the first round of teleportations , together with corrections required to correct the distortion , on each system in a further @xmath384 teleportation channels which she will use in a second round . again , if no distortion has occurred @xmath385 alice s operations transform the eigenstates of @xmath373 into product @xmath12-spin states . 3 .",
    "alice teleports all @xmath384 systems back to bob .",
    "4 .   if no distortion has occurred @xmath386 , bob measures the teleported system in the @xmath12-spin basis and the measurement of @xmath373 is complete .",
    "this occurs with probability @xmath387 .",
    "_ round 3 _    1 .   if @xmath388 , bob again teleports his system back to alice in the teleportation channel corresponding to the",
    " subcluster \" @xmath389 of the original cluster @xmath383 , together with his results @xmath389 , and records the outcomes of the latest set of bell measurements @xmath390 .",
    "alice performs unitary operations on each system in @xmath391 teleportation channels used in the third round .",
    "the operations on each channel are such that if bob teleported the system in this channel and the teleportation succeeded without distortion , the eigenstates of @xmath373 are again transformed to @xmath12-spin product states .",
    "alice teleports all @xmath391 systems back to bob .",
    "if @xmath392 , bob measures the teleported system in the @xmath12-basis and the measurement is complete .",
    "this occurs with probability @xmath387 as in the second round .",
    "again , if @xmath393 , bob teleports the system back to alice . . . , and so on , until a successful measurement is performed",
    "thus we see that the general procedure requires many teleportation channels which are utilised sequentially in a series of nested clusters , with two channels in the first round , @xmath394 clusters of two channels in the second round , @xmath395 subclusters of two channels in the third . .",
    "the probability for success in the first round is @xmath396 , and is @xmath397 in every subsequent round , so that the total probability for success may be brought arbitrarily close to one if sufficient entanglement resources are available .",
    "the procedure may be extended to three parts in the following manner . in step @xmath200",
    "bob and collin , who is now allowed to take part in the experiments and not to just assist , both teleport their states to alice . in stage @xmath226",
    "alice completes unitary operations which require undistorted teleportation from both bob and collin in order to transform the eigenstates of an operator @xmath398 into @xmath12-spin product states . in step @xmath399",
    "she teleports the complete system to bob , as before . in step @xmath400 , instead of performing local measurements , bob teleports the system to collin using a particular teleportation channel @xmath401 , which is dependent upon the outcome of his first set of bell measurement , @xmath383 .",
    "there are then five additional stages . in step",
    "@xmath402 collin teleports all the systems from bob s teleportation channels , except the system corresponding to @xmath403 , back to alice .",
    "instead he measures this system in the @xmath12-spin basis ( step @xmath404 ) and chooses a particular channel @xmath405 to send the original system from channel @xmath401 , according to the results of his bell measurements @xmath406 . in the final three stages alice",
    "again performs appropriate unitary operations ( step @xmath407 ) and , assuming no distortion teleports them back to bob ( step @xmath408 ) , who performs local measurements ( step @xmath409 ) and starts again at stage @xmath200 to initiate the second round if necessary .",
    "an analogous procedure involving @xmath410 individual steps may be used to measure a nonlocal variable of a four part system , @xmath411 steps for a five part system , and so on .",
    "finally we notice that vaidman s procedure in no way contradicts the principle of relativistic causality , and that the question posed way back in 1931 has finally has finally been answered - _ all _ nonlocal variables may measured instantaneously be granted the status of observables in relativistic quantum mechanics ! _ or can they . .",
    "we have seen that there are , in principle , _ no _ causal restrictions upon the measurability of self - adjoint operators in quantum theory . in particular the values of all nonlocal variables may be determined instantaneously , and so all such variables may be granted the status of quantum mechanical observables .",
    "this , in turn , implies that all nonlocal states may be verified by specifying their simultaneous eigenvalues for sets of commuting operators .",
    "however , we have also seen that relativistic causality _ does _ place restrictions upon the way in which nonlocal , and even some local variables may be measured .",
    "it was found that the standard von neumann interpretation of quantum mechanical measurement was too restrictive , and that certain projective measurements which would allow superluminal signaling are not physically realisable ( c.f .",
    "[ sectvi.2 ] ) .    in such cases other forms of measurement have been discovered , which do not violate causality , but which do not necessarily prepare the system in an eigenstate of the measured observable ( sects .",
    "[ sectvii]-[sectviii ] ) .",
    "similarly , state verification measurements performed using these procedures do not preserve the initial state , but may only ascertain its simultaneous eigenvalues .",
    "correspondingly , some nonlocal states , may not be verified in nondemolition experiments ( sects .",
    "[ sectiv.3 ] , [ sectv ] ) .",
    "it was also shown that any measurement of a nonlocal variable necessarily erases _ some _ local information , which is a completely general result ( sect .",
    "[ sectvi.1 ] ) .",
    "these conclusions hold , for the time being , with one important caveat .",
    "it is , in fact , not yet clear whether _ all _ variables related to spread out fermionic wave functions may be measured instantaneously . in particular , it is not clear whether the above results can be generalised to include all quantum systems which are themselves in a superposition of being in different places .",
    "measurements of variables related to such systems rely on the ability to transform the local state of a particle , which is in a nonlocal superposition , into a locally measurable state of a composite system ; that is , of the system consisting of the particle(s ) and measuring device .",
    "although , for bosons , local operations of this form have already been achieved @xcite , the space - like separated local variables corresponding to the measurement of a fermion state should , in theory , fulfill anticommutation relations in accordance with the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "this has led vaidman and others to postulate the existence of superselection rules which prevent such transformations @xcite .",
