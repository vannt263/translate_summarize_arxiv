    "one of the most striking aspect of the structure of atomic nuclei is the very small violation of the isobaric invariance .",
    "this is so even for heavy nuclei where the coulomb interaction is not thought a priori to act merely in a perturbative manner . as pointed out for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is due to the weak variation of the symmetry - breaking coulomb field over the nuclear volume .",
    "it has also been suggested from phenomenological and fundamental ( at the levels of quarks having different masses ) points of view that genuine isospin non - conserving parts of the strong interaction should be considered .",
    "they should however be rather small as compared to their conserving counterparts .    as a consequence , it has been found that a nuclear ground state @xmath4 may be thought as being composed of mostly a @xmath5 component where @xmath6 with a small @xmath7 admixture , namely @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "even though in most cases the isobaric invariance may be flatly assumed , there are phenomena where a specific knowledge of the isospin mixing is needed .",
    "this is in particular the case whenever some observed transition or reaction would be forbidden , should this invariance be exactly fulfilled .",
    "interesting cases , where the isospin mixing has to be considered , are also related with beta - decay properties ( see , e.g. , the review of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . of particular importance in that respect",
    "are the studies of superallowed @xmath10-to-@xmath10 nuclear @xmath11 decays in the context of the tests of the cvc hypothesis ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) through @xmath12-value measurements . hence",
    ", a specific determination of the effect of the isospin mixing is required to correct the value yielded by the crude isospin - multiplet approximation ( determining thus the so - called @xmath13 corrective term ) .",
    "before entering , in a subsequent study , into a detailed assessment of the transition matrix element involved in such particular decays , we consider it interesting to evaluate first the actual importance of the isospin mixing as measured for instance by @xmath14 .",
    "this is the subject of the present paper .",
    "presently available theoretical estimates of the isospin mixing fall into three different categories .",
    "first , one has to quote the hydrodynamical approach of bohr , damgrd and mottelson  @xcite which consists in quantifying the normal modes associated with the polarization effect of the coulomb field on a spherically symmetrical isovector density . in @xmath15 nuclei",
    "this approach yields the probability @xmath14 of the @xmath16 component , in sole addition to the dominating @xmath17 component , which is given by @xmath18 it therefore amounts , e.g. , for the @xmath19ca nucleus to about 0.16% . in nuclei having a neutron excess",
    ", these authors estimate that @xmath14 ( meaning now the probability of the @xmath20 component over the dominating @xmath21 component ) is equal to the value given by eq .",
    "( [ bohrmottelson ] ) divided by @xmath20 .",
    "this reduction , which is expressed in terms of a factor being merely the square of a clebsch ",
    "gordan coefficient , has been first advocated by lane and soper  @xcite .",
    "it yields , e.g. , for the @xmath22ca nucleus , a value of @xmath14 of about 0.04% .    the second class of approaches are based on shell - model calculations .",
    "their success is contingent , as usual within such an approach , upon the relevance of the matrix elements in use . for the description of isospin mixing ,",
    "an accurate determination of coulomb matrix elements is of course of paramount importance ( see for instance the discussion of coulomb energy differences in @xmath23 and @xmath24 mirror pairs  @xcite ) .",
    "this constitutes an a priori necessary condition to provide valuable answers to the question left open on the real importance of isospin non - conserving forces as studied for example to explain the isobaric multiplet yrast energies in ref .",
    "other concerns are related to a good description of radial single - particle wave functions as in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite to describe asymmetry factors in parity - violating electron scattering .",
    "one definite difficulty of shell - model calculations is due to the fact that they do not take into account any core isospin mixing , excepted of course for the no - core shell model calculations limited to very light nuclei ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one might then be inclined to think that microscopic calculations making use of phenomenological nucleon - nucleon forces should be able to describe the polarization effects of the coulomb interaction at least at the mean field level , in a satisfactory way .",
    "indeed , as opposed to shell - model calculations , mean - field calculations are expected to provide rather elaborate single - particle wave functions and they do not rely on any inert core approximation .",
    "however , apart from possible consequences of well - known symmetry violations inherent to the mean field approximation , they request as a next very important step to account accurately for the correlations .",
    "this may be done without serious a priori problems for rpa - type correlations , as performed for instance in  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the hydrodynamical ansatz of ref .",
    "@xcite underestimates the isospin mixing by a factor 2 to 4 ( see fig .  3 of  @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to note that the latter approach does not include important correlations , namely pairing correlations .",
    "there are good practical reasons for such an omission .",
    "the usual handling of pairing correlations within a kind of bogoliubov quasiparticle vacuum approximation as in the bcs or hartree  fock  bogoliubov theory is totally unfit for the isospin mixing problem .",
    "indeed , such an ansatz yields spurious components of both charge state particle numbers , giving rise in turn to a spurious mixing of @xmath25-components which invalidates a priori any attempt to extract out of them any meaningful @xmath26-mixing properties .",
    "this is why we make use here of the higher tamm  dancoff approach ( htda ) which can be interpreted as a highly truncated shell model built on a self - consistent hartree ",
    "fock solution  @xcite . at this stage",
    "we focus on the role of @xmath27 pairing correlations , which gives us an upper limit of the isospin mixing parameter since proton - neutron pairing correlations are expected to reduce the isospin mixing as it will be discussed below . for the time - being we will not evaluate the effect of rpa correlations which could be ( and will soon be ) easily taken into account into the htda framework .",
    "to determine @xmath14 , we should in principle perform a projection of the ground state @xmath4 on good isospin states @xmath28 .",
    "assuming , however , that components higher than @xmath7 are negligible , as in eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) , we can deduce @xmath14 from the calculation of the expectation value of the square of the isospin operator @xmath29 in the state @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath4 is normalized to unity and assuming that the dominant contribution of the ground - state ( gs ) isospin comes from @xmath5 , we have @xmath30 hence @xmath31    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the derivation of the expression for the expectation value of @xmath32 in the state @xmath4 in sect .",
    "[ expvalt2 ] , we present in sect .",
    "[ res ] the results of the htda calculations for the gs properties and the values of all relevant isospin quantities , such as the expectation value @xmath33 , the deduced value of @xmath26 and the isospin - mixing parameter @xmath14 for a large sample of nuclei .",
    "the main conclusions of this study are drawn in sect .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "neglecting here the proton - neutron residual interaction , we can write the many - body state @xmath4 describing the ground state of a nucleus as the product of the correlated states @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath36 where , in the htda approach , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 for neutrons and @xmath39 for protons ) is a superposition of @xmath40-particle slater determinants ( @xmath41 for neutrons and @xmath42 for protons ) of the form @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ psi_tau_htda ] ) , @xmath44 denotes the hartree ",

    "the a priori complex coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 are determined by minimizing the energy functional calculated for @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , in order for the many - body state @xmath4 , when constructed with real single particle wave functions , to be time - reversal invariant , the coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath50 must be real .",

    "since @xmath32 is a sum of one - body and two - body operators , the only contributions in the off - diagonal term of eq.([expval_tsqr ] ) are therefore those for which @xmath54 and @xmath55 differ by a particle - hole excitation of order less than or equal to  2 . in the following",
    "it will be useful to recall that , if @xmath56 and @xmath57 are slater determinants of @xmath58 and @xmath59 particles , respectively , then @xmath54 is a slater determinant of @xmath60 particles .",
    "moreover , a slater determinant @xmath61 without indication of its charge state @xmath62 is to be understood as a product of a neutron @xmath63 and a proton @xmath64 slater determinants .",
    "finally we recall that the number of particles of each charge state @xmath62 is even since we treat here even - even nuclei only .    using the expressions for the isospin operator developed in appendix  a ,",
    "it is easy to show that the diagonal matrix element of @xmath32 can be written in the form @xmath65 where the notations @xmath66 and @xmath67 are defined in appendix  a. it is important to note that the sums over the occupied single - particle states of @xmath56 and @xmath57 can not be a priori reduced to sums over time - reversed partner states , except for the many - body states ( including @xmath68 ) in which the single - particle states are all paired . when this is not the case",
    ", the contributions of the form @xmath69 or @xmath70 ( where @xmath71 is the time - reversed partner of @xmath72 ) vanish .",
    "therefore the expectation value of @xmath32 in the hartree ",
    "fock ground state @xmath68 is a special case of eq .",
    "( [ n_t2_n ] ) .",
    "the contribution @xmath73 of the diagonal terms in eq .",
    "( [ n_t2_n ] ) to the expectation value of @xmath32 finally writes @xmath74    to calculate the off - diagonal matrix elements we can exploit the fact that one of the two slater determinants of a given charge state is expressed as a @xmath46-particle@xmath46-hole excitation with respect to the other one .",
    "this gives simple expressions for the matrix elements but for each pair of slater determinants @xmath45 and @xmath75 we have to determine the single - particle states @xmath76 , ... , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , ... , @xmath79 ( hole or particle states of @xmath68 ) such that @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a phase factor determined in appendix  b.    the non vanishing off - diagonal matrix element of @xmath32 involving two slater determinants differing by a 1-particle1-hole excitation @xmath82 with @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 finally , for two slater determinants differing by a 2-particle2-hole excitation @xmath85 with @xmath86 , we have @xmath87    from eqs .",
    "( [ n_t2_n1 ] ) and ( [ n_t2_n2 ] ) we deduce that the non vanishing off - diagonal contribution @xmath88 to the expectation value of @xmath32 takes the form    @xmath89    the first two terms of @xmath88 are calculated using respectively the first or the second term of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ n_t2_n1 ] ) , whereas the third term of @xmath88 corresponds to one of the four series of @xmath90 products in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ n_t2_n2 ] ) . in practice ,",
    "the sum of all off - diagonal terms is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath73 .",
    "we consider in this subsection two relevant limiting cases : the hartree ",
    "fock limit and the limit of identical neutron and proton single - particle states .",
    "we will refer to theses limits in sect .",
    "iii to interpret some results .    in the hartree ",
    "fock limit where @xmath91 , we can deduce from eqs .",
    "( [ n_t2_n ] ) , ( [ n_t2_n1 ] ) and ( [ n_t2_n2 ] ) that the off - diagonal matrix elements vanish .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath32 thus simply becomes @xmath92    in the limit where the neutron and proton single - particle states are assumed to be identical , the diagonal contribution ( [ t2_diag ] ) to @xmath93 becomes @xmath94 where @xmath5 and @xmath95 denotes the relative excitation order of @xmath56 with respect of @xmath57 ( see eq .  ( [ reo ] ) of appendix  b ) .",
    "therefore the isospin - mixing parameter takes , in this model case of identical neutron and proton single - particle states , the simple form @xmath96",

    "@xcite where it was applied to study gs pairing properties of @xmath15 nuclei in the mass @xmath105 region . since the above considered nuclei exhibit no triaxial deformation in their ground state , we can search for gs solutions possessing axial symmetry . in the first step ,",
    "we determine the gs deformation within the hartree  fock ",

    "to do so , we use the skyrme interaction in its siii parametrization  @xcite in the mean - field channel , and the seniority force in the pairing channel . for the latter",
    "we retain the same set of parameters as in ref .",

    ", we use 15 oscillator major shells to expand the single - particle states on the cylindrical harmonic - oscillator basis and optimize the basis parameters at the gs deformation so as to obtain the lowest hfbcs binding energy . in the second step ,",
    "we calculate gs properties in the htda approach from the above hfbcs solution .",
    "the residual interaction employed is the delta interaction of ref .",
    "@xcite adjusted in the same way as above for the seniority force but with @xmath110  mev .",

    "however , keeping the same interaction strength throughout the whole considered nuclear region , we have taken care of the well - known @xmath117 energy scale by varying the active pairing window : @xmath118  mev and @xmath119  mev , which yields for @xmath120 the same window parameters as those of ref .",
