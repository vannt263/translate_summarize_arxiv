    "blank field sources ( bfs ) are extreme x - ray loud objects ; the non detection of an optical counterpart down to the palomar limit ( o=21.5 ) imply @xmath5 .    to isolate rosat bfs we selected the rosat pspc pointed observation sources with @xmath6erg  @xmath1s@xmath2 and with no optical counterparts in the digitized sky surveys .",
    "we used all the sources from the wgacat ( white , giommi & angelini 1994 ) that were : ( 1 ) well - detected ; ( 2 ) at high galactic latitude ( @xmath720@xmath8 ) ; ( 3 ) lay within the ` inner circle ' of the pspc ( for their smaller positional uncertainty ) .",
    "we then used the apm digitization of the palomar and uk schmidt sky surveys ( mcmahon & irwin , in preparation ) , via the www , to find sources with no optical counterpart within the 99% x - ray position circle ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "due to a problem with rev  0 images used for wgacat ( giommi , angelini & cagnoni , private communication 1999 ) @xmath10% of the bfs had wrong coordinates .",
    "we quote here the correct positions based on rev  2 version ( from the galpipe catalog ) of rosat data .",
    "the total sample consists of 16 sources .",
    "bfs nature is still mysterious : no known extragalactic population , including normal quasars , agns , bl lacertae objects , normal galaxies and clusters of galaxies , can reach such an extreme @xmath11 ( see maccacaro et al .",
    "1988 s nomograph ) .",
    "+ the unsually large @xmath11 ratio , however , is not the only strong peculiarity of this class of sources .",
    "x - ray colors reveal other interesting properties : bfs tend to have flatter pspc spectra , compared to radio - quiet agns , in both the soft ( 0.1 - 0.8 kev ) and the hard ( 0.9 - 2.4 kev ) pspc range . +",
    "no known source has such an extreme hard distribution in the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane ( fiore et al . , 1998 ,",
    "nicastro , elvis & fiore 1998 ) : galactic x - ray sources have usually very steep pspc spectra , which in term of pspc colors means @xmath12 and @xmath13 greater than 2 ; normal galaxies and/or cluster of galaxies have thermal spectra with typical temperature of 1 kev and are generally distributed within a region of flat @xmath12 and quite steep @xmath13 ; radio - quiet and radio - loud type 1 agn are well described by a single power law in the pspc range and so lie in the central region of the @xmath14 diagram ; finally seyfert 2 , with their heavily absorbed intrinsic x - ray continua , have @xmath12 and @xmath13 typical of normal galaxies ( the contribution from the host galaxy emerging in the soft x - ray band ) .",
    "+ the still open possibilities regarding the nature of bfs are : + 1 ) - quasar  2s : high luminosity , high redshift , heavily obscured quasars , the bright analogs of the well known seyfert 2s ; + 2 ) - low mass seyfert  2 : that is agns powered by a low mass obscured black hole ( i.e. obscured narrow line seyfert 1 ) ; + 3 ) - high redshift clusters of galaxies ; + 4 ) - failed clusters : ( tucker et al .",
    "1995 ) in which a large overdensity of matter has collapsed but has not formed galaxies ; + 5 ) - agns with no big blue bump .",
    "+ the identification of bfs with any of these would be an important find .",
    "+ the faintness of their optical counterparts and the flatness of their pspc spectra can be , in cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , due to the effect of the intrinsic absorption .",
    "for all the bfs we obtained optical imaging in r and k to r=22 ( this corresponds to b@xmath1523.5 for a galaxy ) and k=20 and 5 out of 16 sources show red ( r - k@xmath16 ) counterparts as expected from obscured agns and high z clusters of galaxies .",
    "we are applying to ir telescopes to obtain spectra of these 5 bfs with an interesting counterpart .",
    "the other 11 bfs do not show any obvious counterpart and their x - ray error circles show some sources ( @xmath15 5 ) expected as chance coincidence at these optical / ir magnitude limits ."
