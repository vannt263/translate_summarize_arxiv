    "<S> our results generalize previous studies of the decay of nel order ( imbalance ) , @xmath1 , from clean to disordered systems which is highly relevant to interpret recent @xcite and future cold atomic gas experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath4 in the mbl phase shows an exponential sensitivity on disorder with a critical exponent near the ergodic - mbl phase transition of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> for the entanglement entropy @xmath2 we find a power - law growth at intermediate times with an exponent which varies continuously as a function of disorder . for small @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> we find , in particular , a diffusive growth of entanglement @xmath129 at intermediate times in the mbl phase near the transition while @xmath95 is expected at long times . </S>",
    "<S> this intermediate time behavior might indicate a second relevant length scale in the problem . in this case </S>",
