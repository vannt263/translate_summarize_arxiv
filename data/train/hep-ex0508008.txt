    "the top quark is the fermion with the largest mass in the standard model . in the higgs mechanisms",
    ", this means that the top quark has a large coupling strength with the higgs boson .",
    "this property can be exploited to constrain the expected mass of the higgs boson",
    ". a nlo calculation of the mass of the @xmath0 boson contains corrections term dependent on the top mass and the higgs mass . by accurately measuring @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "it is possible to obtain an estimate for the @xmath3 .",
    "recent tevatron measurements for the top mass of 178.04.3  gev result in a higgs mass prediction of 126@xmath4  gev .",
    "the achievement of a high top mass resolution is instrumental for a precise prediction of @xmath3 .",
    "top quarks are produced at lhc by two types of processes : qcd and electroweak production . in qcd production ,",
    "top quarks are created in @xmath5 pairs via the processes @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the combined nlo cross - section for these two processes is @xmath8825  pb ; 90% of the contribution comes from the gluon - gluon fusion process , the remaining 10% comes from quark - antiquark annihilation .",
    "electroweak production is composed of three channels : the s - channel , the t - channel ( also referred as @xmath0-gluon fusion ) and associated @xmath9 production .",
    "the three processes have cross sections of 11  pb , 60  pb , and 247  pb respectively.the cross - section for ew processes is directly proportional to the ckm matrix element @xmath10 : a deviation from the sm prediction may point to the existence of a fourth quark generation .      in the standard model ,",
    "the top quark decays predominantly into a @xmath0 and a @xmath11-quark with a branching ratio of 0.998 .",
    "because of fermion universality in electroweak interactions , the @xmath0 boson decays 1/3 of the time into a lepton / neutrino pair and 2/3 of the time into a @xmath12 pair . since in @xmath5 events two real @xmath0 bosons",
    "are present , the signatures of the events are classified according to the decays of the two @xmath0 bosons :    all jets channel : :    in this channel both @xmath0s decay into a quark / anti - quark    pair . the event has at least six high-@xmath13 jets , two of    which have to be b - tagged . despite having the highest branching ratio    ( 44% ) ,",
    "this decay channel suffers heavily from qcd background and    ambiguities in the assignment of jets to the originating    @xmath0s .",
    "lepton+jets channel : :    in this decay channel one @xmath0 decays into a    lepton ",
    "neutrino pair , the other @xmath0 into a    quark / anti - quark pair .",
    "thus , the top and anti - top quarks are called    `` leptonic '' or `` hadronic '' accordingly with the decay mode of their    daughter @xmath0 .",
    "the event signature is characterised by one    isolated lepton one b - jet and missing @xmath14 in the    leptonic branch , two light jets and one b - jet in the hadronic branch .",
    "the branching ratio for this channel is about 30% .",
    "di - lepton channel : :    in this decay channel , both @xmath0s decay into a    lepton ",
    "neutrino pair . for practical purposes ,",
    "only @xmath15    are considered , since @xmath16 decays are difficult to    distinguish from the qcd background .",
    "the events have two    high-@xmath13 leptons , two jets ( at least one of which is    b - tagged ) and missing energy due to the neutrinos .",
    "this signature is    quite clear , being affected mainly by electroweak background .",
    "the only    drawback of this decay channel is its low branching ratio ( 5% ) .",
    "the lifetime of the top quark is much shorter than the time constant for spin - flip via gluon emission .",
    "thus , decay products retain the spin information of the original top quark . by measuring the spin of the decay products ,",
    "it is possible to verify the @xmath17 coupling of the @xmath18 vertex or discover a non - sm right - handed coupling .",
    "the lepton+jets @xmath5 channel is the most promising for top mass measurement ; however the channel is affected by combinatorial background .",
    "the assignment of the two b - jets to the hadronic and leptonic branches is not unique , and can spoil the resolution of the top mass measurement .",
    "a study was performed to evaluate the best strategy for the assignment of b - jets .",
    "the study was performed on a mc sample of 200,000 @xmath5 events with full detector simulation .",
    "the selection cuts required at least 4 jets of @xmath13>20  gev and @xmath19<2.5 , @xmath20>20  gev and only one isolated lepton of @xmath13>20  gev . in addition , two b - tagged jets were required with varying @xmath13 thresholds .",
    "the assignment algorithm proceeded as follows : the hadronic branch is assigned to the b - jet with the minimum distance @xmath21 from the hadronic @xmath0 , while the leptonic branch is assigned to the b - jet with the minimum azimuthal angle @xmath22 from the leptonic @xmath0 . if the algorithm produces conflicting assignment , then the algorithm chooses the basis of another variable : the maximum @xmath21 between the b - jet and the lepton , the combination that maximizes @xmath23 or the combination that minimizes @xmath24 or one of the two angles @xmath25 , @xmath26 .    for each of the variables used in the assignment algorithm ,",
    "the purity of the assignment was computed .",
    "the purity varies according to the cut on the minimum @xmath13 of the b - jets : the higher the threshold , the better the purity achieved ( figure  [ fig : etienvre ] ) . on the other hand , a high threshold biases the mass of the reconstructed top quark towards higher value .",
    "the best compromise is to choose a @xmath13 threshold for b - jets of 40  gev , which results in an assignment purity of 70 - 80% .",
    "top / anti - top quark pairs produced in qcd processes are not polarized ; however , the top and anti - top spins are correlated . for qcd processes close to production threshold ,",
    "the @xmath5 system is prodeuced in a @xmath27 state for @xmath12 annihilation , or in a @xmath28 state for gluon - gluon fusion . hence",
    ", in the first case the top and the anti - top have parallel spins , while in the second case the spins are antiparallel . since at lhc the gluon - fusion process has a much larger cross - section than @xmath12 annihilation , nlo calculations predict an excess of top pairs with opposite spins .",
    "the spin of the quarks can be evaluated in the helicity basis , which corresponds to the top ( anti - top ) direction of flight in the @xmath5 system . in this basis , the asymmetry parameter  that expresses the excess of same - helicity pairs  is given by :    @xmath29    for @xmath5 pairs produced with total invariant mass much larger than production threshold , the asymmetry is diluted because of the presence of higher spin @xmath5 pairs .",
    "hence it is useful to introduce a cut in the total invariant mass @xmath30  gev to maximize the power of the experimental analysis .",
    "a significant deviation of the measured asymmetry parameter from the theoretical value may point to non - sm physics , such as right - handed weak interactions .",
    "the asymmetry can be evaluated by studing the angular distributions of the top and anti - top decay products ( spin analyzers ) :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) indicates the the angle between the decay product of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) in the @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) rest frame and the @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) direction in the @xmath5 frame , while @xmath22 indicates the angle between the decay products of @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the respective rest frames @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the spin correlation variables , which can be evaluated using the following unbiased estimators :    @xmath38    the spin correlation parameters have been measured on montecarlo data in the dileptonic and the lepton+jets decay channels . for the dileptonic channel ,",
    "the natural choice for spin analyzers is the two leptons from the decay of the @xmath0s , since leptons are 100% polarized with respect to the top spin .",
    "in the lepton+jets channel , the best choice for spin analyzers would be a lepton and a @xmath39-type quark , since @xmath39 have 100% polarization as well .",
    "however , since it is experimentally impossible to distinguish between light quark flavours , the second spin analyzer is the least energetic jet in the @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) rest frame , which is polarised at 51% .",
    "the @xmath5 sample was created using the event generator toprex  4.05 @xcite in combination with the hadronisation software pythia  6.2 @xcite and the fast detector simulation atlfast @xcite .",
    "the background sample included @xmath5 events decaying to all - hadrons and @xmath16+jets , @xmath0+jets , @xmath40+jets , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and single top production .",
    "the total generated sample corresponds to 10  fb@xmath45 , or one year at lhc at low luminosity ; the sample was generated with varying production parameters to study the systematic effects of :    * q - scales ; * parton distribution functions ; * initial and final state radiation ; * b - fragmentation and hadronisation scheme ; * b - tagging and b - jet calibration ; * generated top mass .",
    "the results of the spin correlation measurements in the two channels are summarised in table  [ tab : spincorr ] ; the spin correlation parameter @xmath37 resulted more suitable for measurements , since it is less sensitive to systematic effects .",
    ".[tab : spincorr ] comparison between the theoretical predictions and the mc measurements for spin correlation parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the di - leptonic and the lepton+jets sample .",
    "the statistical error is written in italics , while the systematic error is written in plain typeface . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the top pair production process is valuable for the in - situ calibration of atlas in the detector commissioning stage : the large cross section and the large @xmath46 ratio for the lepton+jets @xmath5 channel allow to produce high purity samples with large statistics in a short time period .",
    "the experimental signature for top events  high energy leptons and jets , @xmath11-jets , missing @xmath14  involves most parts of the atlas detector , so top samples can play an important role in the calibration of the detector in the initial phases .",
    "the experimental signature for top events include one or more b - jets , arising from the top decay .",
    "thus , the b - tagging performance of atlas has an important role for top analyses .",
    "however , efficient b - tagging needs precise alignment of the trackers of the inner detector , which will be reached only after few months of data taking .",
    "will it be possible to perform top physics in the commissioning stage ? a study has explored the possibility of reconstructing top events in @xmath5 production by assuming the absence of b - tagging .",
    "the kinematic cuts applied to select the top - enriched sample require exeactly one isolated lepton with @xmath13>20  gev and exactly four jets  reconstructed with a cone algorithm of size @xmath21=0.4  with @xmath13>40  gev .",
    "the analysis reconstructs exclusively the hadronic branch of the @xmath5 event : the combination of 3 out of 4 jets with the highest vector @xmath13 sum is assumed to belong to the same top ( antitop ) branch .",
    "the invariant mass of the 3-jets combination is an estimate of the top mass .",
    "the analysis was performed on a generated data sample which included the @xmath5 signal plus a @xmath0 + 4jets background ( leptonic decay of @xmath0 with 4 extra light jets ) .",
    "the invariant mass distribution ( figure  [ fig : stan ] ) is fitted with a gaussian curve  describing the top peak mass  plus a polynomial curve  which accounts for the @xmath0+jets signal plus the combinatorial background .",
    "the fitted gaussian curve peaks at 167.0  gev , with a rms of 12  gev .        in order to obtain a precise measurement of the mass of the top quark ,",
    "it is necessary to know the absolute energy scale of hadronic jets .",
    "miscalibrations can arise from detector effects ( dead channels , imprecise cell weighing ) , physics effects ( final state radiation , pile - up ) , cone algorithms effects ( out - of - cone energy , jet overlap ) .",
    "the best method to achieve a reliable calibration is to use the physics data to reconstruct particles of known properties .",
    "one of this techniques proposes to reconstruct the hadronic @xmath0 from the lepton+jets @xmath5 sample .",
    "the kinematic cuts used to select the sample are the same as the `` commissioning top '' cuts described in the previous section .",
    "in addition , a quality cut is applied : the 4-vectors of the fourth jet , the lepton and the @xmath20 are summed , and the invariant mass is required to be in the range 140  gev<@xmath47<200  gev . with this set of cuts ,",
    "the purity for @xmath0 in the selected sample is @xmath885% .",
    "since the mass of the @xmath0 is known to a precision of a few mev , @xmath1 can be used to obtain calibration factors for the energies of the jets originating from the decay of the @xmath0 . for the jets @xmath48 from the @xmath0 decay ,",
    "momentum conservation implies : @xmath49 where @xmath50 indicates the energy of jet @xmath51 and @xmath52 indicates the angle between the two jets .",
    "thus , the mass measurement is influenced both by the resolution on the jet energy scale and the angular measurement . to disentangle the energy and the angular contributions , the invariant mass of the two - jets system , the @xmath0 nominal mass and the kinematic properties of the jets are used as input in a constrained @xmath53 fit : @xmath54 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath55 .",
    "the result of the fitting procedure is the correction factor @xmath56 , which is assumed to depend on the jet energy @xmath57 . by plotting @xmath56 versus the jet energy ,",
    "a correction function @xmath58 is obtained . applying the correction factor",
    "allows to reconstruct the @xmath0 mass with a 1% precision ( figure  [ fig : pallin ] ) . to obtain such a precision level ,",
    "only 10000 @xmath5 events are necessary  that means that the calibration will be achieved within one or two months of data taking .",
    "the calibration factors have been applied to a @xmath40+jets sample , allowing the same level of precision and showing that the results of the calibration can be used for other physics signatures involving light jets .",
