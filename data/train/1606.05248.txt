    "team coordination is also prized in sports @xcite and military @xcite , where team members coordinate with each other for a common objective of being more successful than the opponent .",
    "a recent survey conducted on high - level managers concluded that teams are central to organizational success@xcite .",
    "the effect of leadership on team performance has been a topic of interest for a long time .",
    "previous works on leadership have dealt with role of leadership in coaching related activities@xcite or managing events in context of teams@xcite .",
    "some works have also focussed on how leadership is shared in teams@xcite",
    ". however , earlier body of work on effect of leadership on team performance was conducted at the level of survey analysis and narrow set of leadership activities@xcite .",
    "one of the major drawback of such studies is that team performances were assessed in a subjective manner in which team leaders rated the performance of their own teams .",
    "an earlier work has shown that team leaders tend to over - rate team performance , since a team s performance reflects the ability of the leader @xcite .",
    "the decisive role of leaders in team s performance has been a long debated topic@xcite . prior works focussed on the paradigm of leader - centeredness , in which the leadership is viewed as a top - down process between the leader and the followers@xcite .",

    "an earlier meta - analysis of @xmath5 studies of teams in natural contexts discus how the network position of team leaders influences team performance@xcite .",
    "* it was observed that teams with stronger interpersonal ties are more successful and teams with leaders who are central in the intra - group networks display better performance @xcite*. one of the main limitations of the earlier studies is that they are restricted to cross - sectional data , primarily due to the limited availability of longitudinal data . to overcome the limitations of previous works",
    ", i employed the treasury of data available in sports @xcite and objectively investigate the association between leadership structure and team performance in interactive contests .",
    "i applied the social network analysis approach to diagnose the role and qualities of a leader effectively .",
    "* leadership involving team activities is a relational construct .",
    "again , social network analysis emphasizes on the relationship of social actors and subsequently elucidates the patterns and theories of such relationships @xcite .",
    "network analysis has been applied to explore the significance of structure of various relationship in organizations @xcite .",
    "social network approach to leadership demonstrated how would - be leaders perfectly perceives the relationship among team members in various organizations @xcite*. social network analysis provides an understanding of the dynamics of centralized leadership and distributed leadership@xcite .",
    "here , i quantified the extent to which leadership potentials are associated with games won across all teams in the history of cricket .",
    "even though cricket is the second most popular game in the world after soccer , compared to other professional sports it has been relatively understudied by academics , although there is no dearth of match statistics .",
    "cricket is chosen for the following reasons .",
    "first , cricket is a game in which an outcome depends a lot on the leadership . compared with other sports the role of a captain is elevated in cricket . *",
    "a cricket captain s direct involvement in the proceedings of a game can be viewed as team - leadership in the corporate world , leadership in politics , social capital @xcite or organizational communication tactics @xcite*. the captain chooses the batting order , sets up fielding positions and shoulders the responsibility of on - field decision - making and is also responsible at all times for ensuring that play is conducted within the spirit of the game as well as within the laws .",
    "however , a coach in soccer or manager in baseball takes decisions off the field , which includes player substitution or deciding batting line - up . in cricket , the role of a captain is not restricted to off - the - field decisions but also to deliver winning performance for the team while playing @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that in cricket , there is no substitution unlike soccer or basketball , where a player is substituted by the coach . to quote sir don bradman _",
    " a captain must make every decision before he knows what its effect will be , and he must carry the full responsibility , not whether his decision will be right or wrong , but whether it brings success \" _ @xcite .    in cricket ,",
    "the captains are appointed based on their performance and position in the team ( often the role is given to batsmen ) .",
    "one of the key role performed by the captain is leading by example @xcite , a quality that is gaining importance in business domains @xcite .",
    "the captain is expected to win the match for his team , commonly referred by fans and commentators as ` captain s knock ' .",
    "legendary players like sir don bradman , richie benaud or sir gary sobers , were great performers and inspired their team through their own performance @xmath0 example of centralized leadership .",
    "even though in cricket there are always formally appointed captains , the emergence of leaders has been seen in many games .",
    "these emergent leaders were responsible for leading their team to victories . while captains like mike brearley or ray illingworth were not the best players in their side but",
    "were known to extract maximum performance from their players .",
    "again , sir gary sobers and sachin tendulkar were best players in their sides , they were not successful captains . in an earlier study",
    "it was shown that steve waugh was the most successful captain in the history of test cricket ( @xmath6)@xcite . again , presence of legendary performers like adam gilchrist , shane warne , glenn mcgrath and ricky ponting in steve waugh s australian team , leads to the well debated topic whether distributed leadership is more successful than centralized leadership . secondly , in a team game like cricket",
    ", one can objectively assess the role of leader - position in the network and team performance .",
    "motivated by the above observations i set to explore the role of leaders in a team game like cricket and the impact of leadership structure on the outcome of a match .",
    "i analyzed the data of batting partnership ( publicly available in cricinfo website @xcite ) in test cricket between @xmath7 and @xmath8 and also one day international cricket between @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "cricinfo has recorded the information for all @xmath1 one day international matches played between @xmath9 and @xmath8 and all @xmath2 test matches played between @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for every match i recorded and analyzed the score - cards which contain the information of match outcome , amount of runs scored by a pair of batsmen and run - rate of each team after the game is over . in order to control for team talent",
    ", i also collected the information about the international cricket council ( icc ) points awarded to every player each year as well as the batting average of every player ( including the captain ) in a year .",
    "data are available upon request .      to articulate the social network analysis approach of studying the pattern of leadership in cricket , i first outline the methodology of identifying the leadership style between two competing teams .",
    "next i discuss the nature of leadership networks and finally discuss the effect of centralized and distributed leadership on the outcome of a game . in cricket two",
    "batsmen always bat in partnership , although only one is on strike at any time .",
    "the partnership of two batsmen comes to an end when one of them is dismissed or at the end of an innings .",
    "fig  [ fig : fig0 ] demonstrates the formation of batting partnership network .",
    "two opening batsmen @xmath10 and @xmath11 start the innings for their team . in network terminology",
    ", this can be visualized as a network with two nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the link representing the partnership between the two players .",
    "weight of the link reflects the amount of runs scored in partnership .",
    "now , if batsman @xmath10 is dismissed by a bowler , then a new batsman @xmath12 arrives to form a new partnership with batsman @xmath11 .",
    "thus a new node @xmath12 gets linked with node @xmath11 .",
    "subsequently one can generate an entire network of batting - partnership till the end of an innings .",
    "the innings comes to an end when @xmath3 players are dismissed or when the duration of play comes to an end@xcite .",
    "the score of a team is the sum of all the runs scored during a batting partnership .",
    "the outcome of a match depends on the batting partnerships between batsmen .",
    "long lasting partnerships not only add runs on the teams score , it may also serve to exhaust the tactics of the fielding team .",
    "again , the concept of partnerships become vital if only one recognized batsman remains .",
    "it is therefore important to identify the key players in a team by constructing network of batting partners .",
    "two batsmen are connected if they formed a batting partnership in the match .",
    "an undirected and weighted batting partnership network is generated for each team and for every match played through @xmath8 .",
    "i examined two network metrics which captures the position of a captain in the batting partnership network in cricket .",
    "a similar approach using network metrics to capture team performance and strategies has been used in basketball @xcite and soccer @xcite .",

    "the betweenness centrality is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the weight of the link between two nodes @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the number of shortest paths between two nodes and @xmath18 is the number of shortest paths that pass through node @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "betweenness centrality measures the extent to which one batsman is between two other batsmen who are not connected to each other .",
    "in other words , betweenness centrality measures how the run scoring by a player during a batting partnership depends on another player . batsmen with high betweenness centrality are crucial for the team for scoring runs without losing his wicket .",
    "these batsmen are important because their dismissal has a huge impact on the structure of the network@xcite .",
    "so a single player with a high betweenness centrality is also a weakness , since the entire team is vulnerable to the loss of his wicket . in an ideal case ,",
    "every captain would seek a combination of players where betweenness scores are uniformly distributed among players .",
    "hence betweenness centrality is a measure of dependence on other team members@xcite .",
    "centralized leadership refers to the post - match situation when captain is the player with highest betweenness centrality , else it is an example of emergent de - centralized leadership .",

    "the magnitude of the coefficients enable us to infer that , in one day international cricket , centralized leadership shows positive effect on team performance , which can be justified by the fact that one day international cricket is more competitive and result oriented than test cricket , where there are situations where teams attempt to draw a match and the outcome remains indecisive .",
    "these findings perhaps indicate that depending on the level of competitiveness , centralized leadership is positively related with team performance .",

    "a recent study has empirically attempted to predict future conflict in team - members@xcite .",
    "leadership will play a critical role in diagnosing and resolving potential conflicts and confrontations among team members .",
    "this paper is limited to the situation where captains led by example , specifically identifying whether the most central player in the batting partnership network is captain of the team . batting partnership network",
    "provides a visual summary of how the batting is centralized around an individual batsman or distributed around multiple batsmen .",
    "since the captain is responsible in selecting an effective batting order , batting partnership network reflects a limited set of roles performed by the captain .",
    "there are various other roles which are performed by the captain @xmath0 inspiring and motivating the players they lead , communicating effectively with the coach and selectors , remaining positive in match situations and devising strategies accordingly . * the work is also limited by the fact that i have considered static network of batting partnerships , when the innings come to an end .",
    "this limitation is due to the available data in cricinfo .",
    "a more robust analysis is possible by considering the dynamic version of the batting partnership network similar to the idea of  dynamic exchange networks \" @xcite , in which the players change as players exchange their batting - striking position .",
