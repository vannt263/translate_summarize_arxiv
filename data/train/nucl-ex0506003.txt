    "we have seen impressive advances in our precise knowledge of many parameters defining the electroweak interaction within the standard model .",
    "however , the value of one of the most fundamental weak parameters , the fermi coupling constant @xmath0 , has not been improved in over two decades ( see fig.[mulife_history ] ) .",
    "usually @xmath0 is determined via a measurement of the muon lifetime @xmath2",
    "@xmath3 with @xmath4 ln@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the qed corrections within the fermi model , @xmath6 , are included in this definition .",
    "within the standard model one can derive the relation @xmath7 with weak radiative corrections being summarized in @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the calculated quantity @xmath8 depends on the entire set of input parameters , e.g. @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "recently , these calculations were improved to the sub - ppm level by including numerically important qcd and electroweak higher - order terms up to 2-loop level .",
    "therefore a precise comparison between theoretical and experimental values , e.g. for @xmath13 ( eq .  [ mwprediction ] ) is possible @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xmath0 sets important constraints on the standard model and susy parameters .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 sets the weak scale and is intimately connected to the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "the best possible experimental measurement of @xmath0 at the present technological limit is therefore highly desirable , as the 18  ppm precision limit on the pdg average on @xmath14 @xcite is dominated by experimental counting statistics .        the mulan experiment ( * mu*on * l*ifetime * an*alysis ) , intents to measure a total of @xmath15 @xmath16 decays , in order to achieve a 1  ppm statistical error in the lifetime . since the status report on the muxprogram in @xcite we have achieved substantial progress .",
    "a modification of the continuous high intensity muon beam line at the paul scherrer institut was necessary to enable the collection of @xmath15 events within a reasonable time .",
    "we have built an electrostatic kicker which applies an artificial time structure to the dc beam in the @xmath17e3 area and found a kickable beam tune which provides up to 8  mhz of muons . following a 5  @xmath18s muon collection period in the target",
    ", the kicker deflects the beam for 27  @xmath18s while muon decays are measured .",
    "mulan is designed to minimize the systematic errors in several ways : the beam muons are highly polarized , and the preferential emission of decay positrons in muon spin direction could cause a position- and time - dependent positron detection efficiency as polarized muons rotate in an external magnetic field .",
    "we are currently investigating two specific targets : i ) arnokrome-3 ( fig.[mulan - setup]b ) is a proprietary chromium - cobalt - iron alloy sheet , which , due to an internal field of a few tesla , precesses muons very fast with respect to muon decay",
    ". therefore polarization effects are negligible .",
    "ii ) a solid sulfur target which maximizes the depolarization of the beam muons .",
    "it is placed in a homogeneous 120  gauss magnetic field which causes a fast visible muon rotation and allows us to fit the corresponding decay positron asymmetry .",
    "we are presently investigating samples of @xmath19 decay positrons from each target to select the optimal material choice .",
    "additionally , a polarization - preserving silver target is being used for control purposes.mulans highly modular detector ( fig.[mulan - setup]a ) of 174 coincident scintillator tile pairs in `` soccer ball '' geometry allows us to compare opposite counters , thus strongly reducing precession effects in the count rate sum .    *",
    "@xmath20 `` sneaky muons : '' * a fast thin entrance muon counter ( emc ) records beam muons and looks for muons sneaking in during the measurement interval . a magnet positioned behind the emc precesses the tiny fraction of muons stopped in the detector materials ,",
    "otherwise they too could cause small detection inefficiencies .    * @xmath20 off - target muon stopping : * muon stops before the target are minimized by decreasing the materials in the muon path .",
    "consequently we installed a helium bag ( fig.[mulan - setup]b ) and used very thin mylar windows and emc materials .    *",
    "@xmath20 pile - up : * the high detector modularity and the fast scintillator response time reduce pile - up .",
    "additional time resolution will be gained via new 500  mhz waveform digitizers ( wfd ) presently under construction , which will provide a double pulse resolution better than 4  ns .",
    "final wfd implementation to all detector channels is planned for 2005 .",
    "the mulan detector ( fig.[mulan - setup]a ) was successfully commissioned in 2004 and yielded its first physics data .",
    "fig.[mulan - lifetime ] shows a 10 minute snapshot from our ak3 target data .",
    "we used multi - hit tdcs for detector readout . the muon accumulation time and the decay recording time",
    "are indicated .",
    "our present analysis goal with this data is a 5  ppm precision determination of @xmath0 .",
    "we intend to collect the full statistics in 2006 .",
    "the @xmath21 description of weak interactions has been tested to a high precision .",
    "processes involving structureless fermions , e.g. muon decay , show equal vector ( _ v _ ) and axial - vector ( _ a _ ) coupling . in @xmath22-decay as well as in nuclear muon",
    "capture on the proton @xmath23  , the axial coupling @xmath24 is modified due to hadronic effects caused by the involved nucleon .",
    "muon capture occurs at higher four - momentum transfer @xmath25 than @xmath22-decay .",
    "lorentz invariance constrains the corresponding weak current matrix elements to six independent terms , @xmath26 with corresponding weak form factors @xmath27 ( @xmath28 = scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , axial - vector , tensor , weak magnetism ) ; mass of the nucleon @xmath29 and muon @xmath30 . because of g - symmetry @xmath31 and @xmath32 vanish @xcite . due to the momentum dependence ,",
    "only @xmath24 and @xmath33 contribute in @xmath22-decay at very low @xmath34 .",
    "nuclear muon capture is the process most sensitive to @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , @xmath36 is dubbed induced pseudoscalar coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "while the values of @xmath33 , @xmath24 and @xmath37 are established on the @xmath38 to @xmath39 level @xcite , the situation is totally different for the induced pseudoscalar @xmath1 .",
    "the theoretical view , historically based on pcac and pion pole dominance , and recently strictly derived within chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath40pt ) @xcite , is remarkably precise : @xmath41 depending on the exact values of the pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath42 and the mean axial radius of the nucleon @xmath43 .",
    "the standard model based calculation of the singlet muon capture rate by govaerts and lucio - martinez @xcite has reached 0.55% precision .",
    "this precision in calculation will allow a high precision measurement to distinguish between the pion pole contribution to @xmath1 and the correction term .",
    "moreover , such a measurement will also set tight limits on various theoretical scenarios beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "the present experimental knowledge of @xmath1 is unsatisfying , and discrepancies cause considerable debate .",
    "determinations via ordinary muon capture in hydrogen ( omc ) @xcite , @xmath44he @xcite and larger nuclei essentially confirm the theory result .",
    "however the precision of the latter is troubled by model dependencies .",
    "a radiative muon capture on the proton ( rmc ) experiment @xcite , which measured an additionally very rarely emitted high energy @xmath45 ray in conjunction with the muon capture process , yielded a different result times lower branching than omc , the emitted @xmath45 can have energies up to 100  mev .",
    "therefore these @xmath45 s come closer to the pion pole and the measurement is in principle four times more sensitive to @xmath1 than omc . ] .",
    "the present most likely explanation lies in the insufficient knowledge of the complex kinetics of negative muons in hydrogen .",
    "the @xmath46 atom is formed in statistically populated singlet and triplet states , and the muon capture rate from these states differ by a factor of @xmath4760 due to the strong spin dependence of weak interactions .",
    "an exact knowledge of the spin populations is therefore mandatory for the interpretation of a measurement .",
    "the initial @xmath46 populations are modified via spin flip and molecular formation processes , which eventually yield a fraction of muonic hydrogen molecules ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the respective rates for both types of process scale with density , and hence are high in the liquid hydrogen targets which were used in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite",
    ". however , a large @xmath18-molecular population causes a large correction to the lifetime and hence a corresponding uncertainty .",
    "specifically the ortho to para spin - flip rate in @xmath48 molecules @xmath49 ( fig.[gp - plot]b ) is a prime suspect to cause the experimental discrepancy in @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ gp - plot ] , updated from @xcite , shows the @xmath49 dependence of the omc and rmc results .",
    "the controversial @xmath49 values are also shown .",
    "two experimental values from saclay @xcite and triumf @xcite , which were obtained together within the same experiments performing the omc and rmc measurements , strongly disagree , and the only theoretical calculation @xcite does not clarify the situation .",
    "it is evident that using the @xmath49 rate from the same measurements brings the @xmath1 value in agreement with theory .",
    "however , the use of the other @xmath49 value enlarges the disagreement to the prediction or lowers it to an unphysical negative value . clearly",
    "only a new determination of @xmath1 independent of @xmath49 can resolve this situation .",
    "the experimental principle of the mucap ( * mu*on * cap*ture ) experiment is based on the measurement and comparison of the decay time of positive and negative muons in hydrogen .",
    "the mucap experiment is designed to overcome the multiple difficult problems of previous experiments .",
    "the important conceptual advantage of mucap is the selection of target hydrogen at gaseous density ( 10 bar at room temperature ) , which minimizes the kinetics dependence of the result on @xmath1 as shown in fig.[gp - plot]a . at low densities ,",
    "muon capture occurs almost exclusively from the singlet state on the proton , and even a large estimated error on @xmath49 results only in a systematic error on the 10  ppm level .",
    "the full setup is shown in fig.[mucap - setup ] .",
    "the active gaseous hydrogen target , a time projection chamber ( tpc ) , allows for a full 3-dimensional reconstruction of the muon path to its stopping point and therefore a selection of clean muon stops away from walls and wires .",
    "the observed stopping distribution of muons is shown in fig.[fadc_event]a .",
    "the tpc also detects muon capture events on impurity atoms ( @xmath50 ) via the very large signals generated from capture products .",
    "thus the tpc serves also as a very sensitive impurity monitor .",
    "the high rates of muon transfer to and nuclear capture on high-@xmath51 atoms ( fig.[gp - plot]b ) can cause a deflection of the exponential lifetime even at very low impurity concentrations as these rates are typically orders of magnitude higher than muon decay . in order to minimize this effect ,",
    "target purity requirements are very stringent , with the goal to be on the 10@xmath52 contamination level for the sum of high-@xmath51 atoms .",
    "additionally , the exact knowledge of these contaminations is necessary to calculate the correction factor to the lifetime .",
    "consequently , the hydrogen gas after production in electrolysis is filled via a palladium filter and continuously run through a zeolite based purification system ( chups ) .",
    "the chups system @xcite is specifically designed to maintain the hydrogen flow with negligible variations in density or hence in tpc gain . in fall 2004 we maintained clean target conditions ( as low as 70  ppb impurities ) for over 5 weeks .     from the mucap fall 2004 run .",
    "the three different curves show the benefits of the decay electron detection by the two wire chambers .",
    "curve 1 ( black ) is obtained with requirement of a clean pileup - free muon stop in the tpc and a four - fold esc coincidence hit .",
    "curve 2 ( red ) requires a time coincident hit in both epc1 and epc2 .",
    "curve 3 ( blue ) additionally tracks the observed electron and requires less than 10  cm impact parameter ( approximately the sensitive tpc volume ) .",
    "the huge reduction in background is obvious .",
    "the necessary @xmath5325  @xmath18s pileup veto is responsible for the background s shape .",
    ", height=321 ]    mucap fully separates the muon and electron detectors to avoid dangerous cross - correlations .",
    "decay electron times are measured in the scintillator hodoscope ( esc ) surrounding the hydrogen vessel .",
    "two cylindrical wire chambers track the electron back in 3 dimensions to its @xmath18-stop origin , thus largely reducing the background .",
    "the impact parameter , defined as the minimal distance between detected muon stop and electron track , serves as an important handle on a very subtle systematic effect on the lifetime : the diffusion of muons which transfer to deuterium , an isotope always present in hydrogen .",
    "although we are using special deuterium - depleted hydrogen , ( `` protium '' ) , with deuterium content as low as 1.5  ppm , this deuterium concentration is still high enough to cause a visible effect in our setup via electron tracks with dislocated origin .",
    "this dislocation , due to @xmath54 diffusion over macroscopic distances is possible because of a ramsauer - townsend minimum in the @xmath55 scattering cross - section at low energies .",
    "such @xmath54 s can hit a wall or wire , transfer and then undergo unobserved nuclear capture outside the sensitive volume .",
    "the electron wire chamber tracking identifies such events and the corresponding lifetime dependence on the impact parameter will allow us to determine the deuterium contamination in situ @xcite . additionally , we have been developing a precision trace deuterium detection method via @xmath56 fusion @xcite .    as in mulan",
    ", mucap applies a magnetic field to control muon spin rotation effects in the @xmath57 measurement .",
    "a water - cooled aluminum coil was developed to minimize decay electron scattering .",
    "eventually mucap needs 10@xmath58 cleanly observed decay electrons and positrons to statistically reach the goal of 1  % in the capture rate , reflecting 10  ppm in the respective muon lifetimes .",
    "this is possible in several weeks of running in the fully pile - up protected mode .",
    "in the future we also intend to use the mulan kicked beamline with the mucap experiment and operate it in a `` muon on request mode '' @xcite .",
    "fig.[mucap - lifetime ] shows a preliminary lifetime plot from our fall 2004 data .",
    "one can clearly see the huge improvement in background reduction due to the implementation of the two cylindrical wire chambers .",
    "the shown @xmath472@xmath5910@xmath60 `` clean '' @xmath18 decay events are presently being analyzed , and a first result on @xmath1 is expected in late 2005 .",
    "both experiments , mucap and mulan , are on the way to reach ultimate precision in their respective measurements .",
