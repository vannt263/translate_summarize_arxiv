    "one of the main difficulties in the implementation of quantum information processing is the susceptibility of quantum systems to interactions with their environment .",
    "any such uncontrolled interaction degrades the quantum information stored in the system ; in the present context , this process is known as decoherence.@xcite when a quantum system performs an information processing task , decoherence causes computational errors , which leads to the eventual loss of any quantum advantage in information processing.@xcite dynamical decoupling ( dd ) is a form of quantum error _ suppression _ that modifies the system - environment interaction so that its overall effects are very nearly self - canceling , thereby decoupling the system evolution from that of the decoherence - inducing environment.@xcite dd has been primarily studied as a specialized quantum control technique for state preservation , or quantum memory . in this",
    "setting it has been demonstrated theoretically that dd  is capable of generating long - lived and robust quantum states .",
    "three recently introduced techniques have figured most prominently in this effort : randomized dd  ( rdd),@xcite concatenated dd  ( cdd),khodjastehlidar:04 and uhrig dd  ( udd).@xcite rdd , which involves randomly selected pulse types applied at regular intervals , works best for strongly time - dependent environments and in the long time limit.@xcite udd , which involves an optimization of pulse intervals for a fixed pulse type , is provably optimal for the restricted case of a single qubit with diagonal coupling to the environment.@xcite udd  has been the subject of extensive recent experimental tests . following some notable successes , biercuk:09,biercuk-2009,jenista2009optimized the general picture emerging is that udd performance depends sensitively on the existence of a sharp high - frequency cutoff ; in the absence of such a cutoff simpler dd  schemes tend to result in better performance.ryan2010extending,szwer2010keeping,ajoy2010optimal udd was recently extended to quadratic dd  ( qdd ) which applies to general environments , but is still limited to only a single qubit.@xcite very recently a generalization of qdd to multiple qubits was proposed , which involves a higher order nesting of udd sequences.@xcite cdd is a method for constructing pulse sequences with a recursive structure . while cdd requires longer pulse sequences than udd and qdd ,",
    "there is strong theoretical evidence that it can be successfully combined with quantum computation and incorporated into quantum logic circuits.@xcite for this reason we focus here on cdd , and present the first experimental evidence , using nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )  techniques , for the theoretically predicted advantagekhodjastehlidar:04,khodjastehlidar:07,witzel:07a , physrevb.75.201302,zhang:08,nlp:09,west:10 of using cdd  for quantum memory preservation over its common counterpart periodic dynamical decoupling(pdd ) .",
    "we also provide a theoretical analysis in support of these experimental results . though our experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of cdd specifically for nmr , the cdd framework is generally applicable to any decohering quantum system .",
    "our results lend support to the expectation that quantum dynamical decoupling will prove an indispensable tool in scalable quantum information processing .",
    "we consider a system described by a hamiltonian @xmath0where @xmath1 acts on the system degrees of freedom , @xmath2 on the environment and @xmath3 couples the system to the environment .",
    "to suppress errors , dd allows the system to evolve for some time before applying a control pulse to redirect or refocus the evolution toward the error - free ideal , continually repeating this process until some total evolution has completed : @xmath4=p_{n}u(\\tau _ { 0})\\cdots p_{2}u(\\tau _ { 0})p_{1}u(\\tau _ { 0})=\\widetilde{u}(n\\tau _ { 0}),\\]]where @xmath5 represents the unitary evolution of the combined system and environment , or bath , for a duration of length @xmath6 , decomposed so that @xmath7 determines the ideal , desired error - free evolution generated by a piece - wise constant system hamiltonian @xmath1 , and @xmath8 is a unitary error operator acting jointly on the system and bath .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath9 to denote evolution in the presence of dd pulses . for now , we implicitly assume that the pulses @xmath10 are sufficiently fast as to not contribute to the total time of the evolution .",
    "this assumption is not essential , but is useful in simplifying our present discussion .",
    "the simplest example is quantum memory , where @xmath11 is the identity operation or free - evolution  of the system ,  and @xmath8 represents the deviation from the ideal dynamics caused by the presence of a bath . in this case ,",
    "our goal is to choose pulses so that @xmath12=i_{s}\\otimes \\widetilde{b}$ ] , the identity acting on the system and an arbitrary pure bath operator @xmath13 .",
    "dd schemes differ in precisely how these pulses @xmath10 are chosen , with the only common constraint that the following basic decoupling condition  is met:@xcite @xmath14to be concrete , we will suppose that the pulses @xmath15 are pauli operators , though again this assumption only serves to keep the explanation simple and is not strictly necessary .",
    "cdd generates pulse sequences by _ recursively _ building on a base sequence @xmath16x[\\cdot ] z[\\cdot ] x[\\cdot ] $ ] ( or any other ordered pair of pauli operators from the set @xmath17 ) , as follows .",
    "the sequence is initialized as @xmath18=u(\\tau _ { 0})=u_{0}(\\tau _ { 0})b(\\tau _ { 0})\\equiv   \\widetilde{u}_{0}(\\tau _ { 0 } ) , \\label{cdd0}\\]]and higher levels are generated via the rule @xmath19 = \\notag \\\\ & & z[\\widetilde{u}_{n}(\\tau _",

    "thus , at each level the total duration of the cdd  pulse sequence grows by a factor of @xmath21 , while the pulse interval remains fixed at its initial value @xmath6 .",
    "note that we are allowing for the possibility of some non - trivial information processing operation @xmath7 , as implemented in ref .  .",
    "the choice of the base sequence is motivated by the observation that it satisfies the decoupling condition  ( [ basicdd ] ) in the quantum memory setting @xmath11 , under the dominant 1-local  system - bath coupling term @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 denote the pauli matrices acting on system qubit @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are arbitrary bath operators .",
    "( the next order 2-local  coupling would have terms such as @xmath28 , etc . ) for this reason the base sequence is sometimes called the universal decoupler .",
    "similarly , the most common pulse sequence used thus far in dd  experiments is periodic dd  ( pdd ) , which generates pulse sequences by _ periodically _ repeating the universal decoupler base sequence @xmath29x[\\cdot ] z[\\cdot ] x[\\cdot ] $ ] : @xmath30=(\\operatorname{pdd}_{1}[u(\\tau _ { 0})])^{k}=\\widetilde{u}_{k}(4k\\tau _ { 0 } ) ,   \\label{eq : pdd - def}\\]]where @xmath31=\\operatorname{cdd}_{1}[u(\\tau _ { 0})]$ ] .",

    "indeed , it is natural to try to design a good  pulse sequence and then repeat it over and over again so as to cover a desired total experiment time @xmath47 .",
    "cdd breaks with this intuition and tradition , by demanding that a different pulse sequence be used for every given @xmath47:given a feasible pulse interval @xmath6 , the appropriate cdd  order @xmath35 is found from the condition @xmath48 .",

    ", we used a sample of powdered adamantane . in this plastic crystal ,",
    "the nearly spherical molecules tumble rapidly and isotropically in the solid phase .",
    "the motion averages all intramolecular dipolar couplings to zero , but does not eliminate intermolecular couplings . as a result of this averaging process , there is only one coupling between every pair of molecules , thereby reducing the adamantane molecule to a point dipole source containing 16 proton spins or 16 proton spins and one @xmath50c - nuclear spin in any c position ( 11% of the molecules ) .",
    "all remaining interactions ( except for the zeeman term ) are insignificant .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath50c nmr signals was enhanced by the standard cross - polarization experiment , which provides polarization transfer from the abundant @xmath51h spins .",
    "the enhancement factor of the @xmath50c signal was about 3.2 .",
    "after the transfer , the carbon spin magnetization was stored for 2 ms as longitudinal magnetization . another @xmath45/2 pulse created transverse @xmath50c magnetization as the initial state for the dynamic decoupling experiments .    in the experiments ,",
    "the width @xmath52 of the @xmath53 pulses for @xmath50c was 10.52 @xmath54s .",
    "pairs of @xmath53 pulses with the same phase and no intervening delay were omitted . for pairs of @xmath53 pulses with different phases",

    "as an example , @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 denotes free evolution , without pulses ) was implemented as @xmath58 .",
    "the minimum cycle time for the pdd sequence was @xmath59 , for the even - order cdd sequences @xmath60 , and for the odd - order cdd sequences @xmath61 , where @xmath6 is the interval between consecutive @xmath53-pulses .",
    "the remaining signal was detected by measuring the free induction decay of the @xmath50c spins while decoupling the protons after the last echo pulse and a dead - time of @xmath62s . to obtain an accurate signal amplitude , we fourier - transformed the free",
    "induction decays and integrated the signals over the relevant frequency range .",
    "figure  [ nmrsignal ] shows the spin echo signal for the @xmath50c nuclear spin qubits . in each experiment , we applied cyclic sequences of @xmath45-pulses corresponding to the various cdd orders and measured the remaining signal after the end of the sequence .",

    "figure  [ signaldecay ] shows the decay of the signal as the number of cycles and thus the total evolution time increases . in these experiments ,",

    "[ t2 ] , we observe an improvement of almost an order of magnitude in the decoherence rate .",
    "we note the decoherence here is not engineered , but instead caused by the actual dipole - dipole interactions between the @xmath50c qubit and the @xmath70h spins inherent in the adamantane molecule .",
    "we further note that the specific nature of the interaction , be it dipole - dipole , heisenberg , or something else altogether , is inconsequential to the success of cdd .",
    "what matters is the strength of this interaction relative to the dd  pulse interval @xmath6 , as will be made more explicit in the theoretical analysis , to which we now turn .",

    "cdd , on the other hand , compensates for finite pulse width errors , and hence improvement is seen with smaller pulse intervals , as expected.,width=307 ]",
    "we now present a theoretical interpretation of some of the results shown in figures [ nmrsignal]-[t2 ] . to allow for a generic analysis of the dd response to different bath environments and system - bath couplings , we characterize the leading - order dd behavior for simplicity in terms of the following relevant parameters , which capture the strength or overall rate of the internal bath and system - bath dynamics , respectively : @xmath77 and @xmath78.@xcite the total hamiltonian is @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath80 , then the system - bath coupling is a dominant source of error , and remains relatively stable since the internal bath dynamics are comparatively slow . in this case , dd should produce significant fidelity gains as it removes the dominant error source . on the other hand , if @xmath81 , then the system coupling to the environment induces relatively slow dynamics , while the environment itself has fast internal dynamics . in this case",
    ", minimizing the system - bath coupling will have less of an effect on the overall dynamics , so it may be considered a worst case scenario when assessing dd performance .",
    "let us now compare the pure system state @xmath82 obtained in the error - free setting , where @xmath83 ( the desired state ) , to the system state @xmath84 resulting from the presence of a non - zero @xmath3 , but subject to cdd level @xmath35 ( the actual state ) .",
    "the appropriate distance measure , which we would like to minimize , is the trace - norm distance @xmath85 , defined in appendix  [ app : a ] . for a total evolution time @xmath86 using @xmath87 zero - width pulses ,",
    "the distance @xmath85 between the desired and actual state is bounded , in the pessimistic  regime @xmath81 , as : khodjastehlidar:07,lzk:08,nlp:09 @xmath88\\lesssim 2j\\tau _ { 0}\\epsilon ^{n } , \\label{eq : d}\\]]where @xmath89 . here",
    "@xmath90 plays the role of a threshold parameter , i.e. , rapid convergence of the distance to zero in the large @xmath35 limit is guaranteed if @xmath91 .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the error threshold in quantum fault tolerance theory,@xcite but requires us to decrease @xmath6 while the concatenation level rises , in order to mitigate the @xmath92 factor . in general",
    "this is undesirable since the pulse interval can not be decreased indefinitely . indeed , in each of our experiments the pulse interval was fixed and the total time was variable .",
    "the interval length was varied from experiment to experiment , and the total time was adjusted accordingly , depending on the number of pulses used . therefore we next analyze the above bound on @xmath85 under the assumption of fixed pulse interval @xmath6 .",
    "we shall show that , perhaps counterintuitively , there is a regime where increasing the concatenation level , and hence also the total evolution time , actually leads to improved fidelity .",
    "such an improvement can , however , not continue indefinitely , and we shall find that there is an optimal concatenation level beyond which fidelity starts to drop .    if @xmath93 is the desired maximum probability of distinguishing @xmath94 from @xmath95 , we can set the bound ( [ eq : d ] ) on @xmath85 equal to @xmath93 .",
    "this yields a quadratic equation in the number of concatenation levels @xmath35 , whose physically meaningful branch is:@xmath96^{2}-2\\log _ { 4}\\!({j\\tau      _ { 0}}/{\\delta",
    "^{\\ast } } ) -1}\\notag \\\\ & -&\\hspace{-.2cm}[1+\\log _ { 4}(\\beta \\tau _",
    "{ 0})].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( rounding to the nearest integer is implied . )",
    "this quantifies the simulation overheadin cdd ( the analog of the poly - logarithmic simulation overhead in fault tolerance theory@xcite ) , and means that using cdd , in the limit of zero - width pulses , we can obtain a given simulation accuracy target @xmath93 with a number of concatenation levels that scales only _ logarithmically _ in @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "we can also minimize the bound ( [ eq : d ] ) on @xmath85 for @xmath35 at fixed @xmath98 and @xmath97 .",
    "the result is@xmath100which is the optimal number of concatenation levels , in agreement with more involved derivations.@xcite at this optimal value , which increases with decreasing @xmath97 , the bound on @xmath85 scales as @xmath101 and also becomes very small in the small @xmath97 limit . since the internal bath dynamics are the dominant error source here , it is not surprising that the optimal concatenation level only depends on @xmath97 .",
    "a similar expression for optimal concatenation level occurs in the optimistic  @xmath102 regime , depending on both @xmath103 and @xmath104.@xcite the key point is that even in the simplest case : ideal , single - qubit quantum memory , there exists an optimal concatenation level depending on the @xmath98 and @xmath97 parameters , after which point increasing concatenation no longer improves system fidelity .",
    "intuitively , this optimal concatenation level represents the turning point between the competing processes of improved cdd error suppression and the exponentially increasing time for error - prone evolution that occurs with each level of concatenation . the precise point at which dd error suppression is overcome by the accumulated error depends on the relative strengths of the error - inducing hamiltonians , determined by @xmath98 and @xmath105 . for comparison ,",
    "let us also consider the case of pdd with @xmath106 pulses .",
    "in this case the bound @xmath107\\lesssim 2nj\\tau _ { 0}\\beta \\tau _ { 0}$ ] applies under the same assumptions as those required for the cdd bound ( [ eq : d ] ) on @xmath85 .",
    "the evidently much more rapid convergence of cdd , as long as pulse intervals shorter than @xmath108 are attainable ( the @xmath91 condition ) , is due to its recursive structure , which allows cdd to cancel successive orders of the system - bath propagator in time - dependent perturbation theory.@xcite    returning now to our experimental cdd  results ( fig .",
    "[ t2 ] ) , which are in the pessimistic  regime @xmath81,@xcite we see that for @xmath44 they agree with the theoretical prediction that under concatenation , lowering @xmath6 improves the fidelity.@xcite moreover , they are consistent with the @xmath109 regime , where cdd  outperforms pdd . however , as can be seen from figure  [ nmrsignal ] , while cdd consistently outperforms pdd , and both are better than free ( unprotected ) evolution , the performance of both pdd and cdd deteriorates with increasing total experiment time @xmath47 .",
    "thus , our experiments have @xmath110 in the sense of the optimal concatenation level of eq .",
    "( [ nopt ] ) . in other words",
    ", our experiments did not reach the `` sweet spot '' where a higher level of concatenation ( and hence total evolution time ) actually leads to increased fidelity , which would lead to @xmath111 .",
    "the closeness of @xmath90 to @xmath112 and the finiteness of the pulse width play a role in this regard .",
    "early dd schemes were designed to remove unwanted system - bath interactions to a given , low order in time - dependent perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "cdd is the first explicit scheme proposed to remove such interactions to an arbitrary order , via a recursive construction in which each successive level removes another order in time - dependent perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this work reports the first experimental demonstration of cdd , using nmr .",
    "as predicted , cdd outperforms pdd in preserving the fidelity of quantum states . the experimental system studied here  the @xmath50c spin qubit of adamantane  undergoes single - axis decoherence , so that one might suspect that the full cdd sequence we used is `` overkill '' for this system , because this sequence was designed to suppress full three - axis decoherence .",
    "however , pulse errors and magnetic field inhomogeneity result in second order off - axis contributions to decoherence , which is why dd sequences using just a single pulse type ( e.g. , udd ) , can not be expected to perform well on our system . nevertheless , it is important to identify an experimentally feasible nmr system where dephasing and longitudinal relaxation are of comparable magnitude , and to study the performance of cdd relative to other methods capable of suppressing full decoherence , such as qdd .",
