    "the generation of high power thz radiation has led to the development of thz nonlinear optics and spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "nonlinear thz - driven responses in the 0.1 - 5 thz range have been observed in semiconductors @xcite , graphene @xcite , quantum confined systems @xcite , liquids @xcite , gases @xcite , molecular crystals @xcite , and correlated electron materials @xcite .",
    "this advancement has been primarily enabled by the ability to use lithium niobate ( ln ) for thz generation by optical rectification . prior to this , the most common sources of high - power thz radiation were either free - electron lasers @xcite which have limited accessibility , qcls @xcite which have low peak fields , and gas lasers which have long pulse durations . compared to other widely used nonlinear materials like zinc telluride ( znte ) or gallium phosphide ( gap ) ,",
    "ln has a larger nonlinear coefficient ( @xmath1 pm / v @xcite ) for optical rectification , which leads to greater thz generation efficiency .",
    "the major drawback of ln , however , is the large index mismatch between the ultrafast infrared ( ir ) or near infrared ( nir ) pump pulse that is rectified and the thz field that is produced ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) .",
    "this causes the pump pulse to outrun the generated wave , and the thz field is consequently emitted as a cone of cherenkov radiation @xcite .",
    "while this prevents collinear phase matching in ln , it is possible to efficiently generate thz fields using noncollinear phase matching with tilted optical pulse fronts @xcite .",
    "typically , this is accomplished by using a grating to introduce angular dispersion into the beam , resulting in a continuously tilted pulse front @xcite .",
    "this tilted pulse front is them imaged @xcite into the ln prism to produce a pulse with the correct tilt angle so the optical intensity front moves laterally in the ln at a speed that allows matching of the thz phase velocity .    to date",
    ", there have been considerable experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite efforts aimed at improving the generation efficiency of the tilted pulse front technique .",
    "numerical studies suggest @xcite that the three major factors limiting the generation length in the ln crystal come from ( 1 ) the degradation of the pulse duration away from the image plane due to the angular dispersion introduced @xcite and ( 2 ) the imperfect imaging of the tilted pulse front from the grating .",
    "in addition to these , recent work @xcite has proposed that ( 3 ) the inherent coupling between the generated thz radiation and the pump pulse leads to detrimental effects which significantly reduce the interaction length of the pump pulse and necessarily limit the generation efficiency .",
    "while the coupling effects are difficult to manage practically , several suggestions have been proposed to mitigate the other issues .",
    "the first problem can be compensated for by using pulses with smaller bandwidths and hence longer transform limited pulse durations , but this reduces the generated thz bandwidth since there are fewer frequency components to use for optical rectification . moreover ,",
    "many high - field thz generation systems are based on amplified ti : sapphire lasers whose pulse durations are tens of femtoseconds .",
    "such short pulses are often desirable in a nonlinear thz spectroscopy measurement or for electro - optic sampling . for these systems ,",
    "increasing the transform limited duration by filtering would come at the cost of both time resolution and reduced optical pulse energy .",
    "it has also been proposed @xcite that using a direct - contact grating would mitigate the problem of imperfect imaging .",
    "however , this approach reduces the effective generation length compared to that reached by imaging of the beam from a typical grating . this is because when imaging the grating , temporal focusing of the pump pulse and associated optimization of thz generation efficiency occurs on both sides of the image plane over a total distance @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the dispersion length @xcite . however , with the contact grating method , the length over which the optical pulse duration is short is reduced by a factor of 2 .",
    "furthermore , this still requires the use of a highly dispersive grating that leads to limited generation lengths , especially when using pulses with considerable bandwidth .    an alternate scheme which ideally avoids the introduction of large amounts of angular dispersion is a discretely tilted pulse front from a reflective echelon @xcite .",
    "the reflective echelon consists of many small steps that act as mirrors and split a single input beam into many smaller time - delayed  beamlets \" , which together create a discretely tilted pulse front as shown in figure [ ech_schematic](a)-(b ) .",
    "the beamlets are then imaged into the ln prism and act as near - line sources to produce cherenkov sheets of thz radiation .",
    "as the spacing of the imaged steps is small compared to thz wavelengths , the discretely tilted pulse front is effectively continuous over a portion of the thz bandwidth . here",
    ", each beamlet is assumed to generate a thz field independently , provided that the duration of each beamlet is short relative to the time delay between them @xcite .",
    "figure [ ech_schematic](c ) shows results of a simple 2d calculation of the thz sheet generated from a single infinitely tall beamlet with a gaussian spatiotemporal profile @xcite . in this case",
    ", the frequency content of the resulting thz field is set by the beamlet s lateral size .",
    "when the tilt angle is set appropriately , the thz fields resulting from the many responses superpose constructively on one side , leading to coherent field addition and efficient thz generation .    in conventional thz generation with a highly dispersive grating",
    ", a 1-lens imaging system is used to image the pump beam into the ln prism , and beam divergence is largely ignored because angular dispersion and pulse front distortions in the image plane are more far detrimental @xcite . for the echelon ,",
    "the beamlet spot size @xmath6 in the image plane is large relative to the pump pulse wavelength @xmath7 and the rayleigh range @xmath8 is independent of the pulse duration . as a result , the beamlets can be of shorter pulse duration and can propagate for a long distance @xmath9 without appreciable divergence .",
    "pump beam divergence and thz absorption losses in the ln prism then become limiting factors .",
    "this suggests additional benefits by using multiple lenses for imaging to produce collimated beamlets at the image plane that allow exploitation of the long rayleigh range , and by cryogenic cooling of the ln prism @xcite to reduce thz absorption which is due primarily to phonon damping .",
    "in this work , we demonstrate thz generation using a discretely tilted pulse front produced by a reflective echelon as described above .",
    "experiments were performed using a 1-lens imaging system and a 3-element varifocal zoom - lens capable of continuously tunable demagnification from @xmath10 = 0.16 to @xmath10 = 0.29 @xcite at both room temperature ( rt ) and cryogenic temperatures ( ct , @xmath11 100 k ) . using discrete optical pump beams to deliver spatially and",
    "temporally shifted pulses for thz generation in ln or lithium tantalate has been reported based on different approaches including beamsplitting to produce just two beams @xcite , spatiotemporal pulse shaping @xcite , and transmission through a homebuilt stairstep echelon @xcite . in these cases the thz wave remained inside the generation crystal and the conversion efficiency was not measured .",
    "our measurements of the output thz power and field strength show that by using the echelon , it is possible to achieve conversion efficiencies better than those obtained using a grating at room temperature using broadband pulses with sub 100 fs duration from a commercial ti : sapphire laser .",
    "it may also be possible to use pulses with even shorter durations ( @xmath1250 fs ) since the discretely tilted pulse front should not suffer from the adverse effects introduced by angular dispersion .",

    "the step width and height were @xmath19 @xmath0 m and @xmath20 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "as shown in figure [ ech_schematic](a ) , the height determines the time delay between adjacent pulses which is given by @xmath21 fs , and the width determines the initial width of the beamlet ( whose size in the orthogonal direction is @xmath22 9 mm ) that is reflected by each step surface .",
    "the echelon was rotated such that the direction along the 150-@xmath0 m widths of the steps was normal to the incident beam path . upon reflection ,",
    "the input beam was split into many beamlets , resulting in a discrete tilted pulse front with a tilt angle @xmath23 .",

    "the beam was split 90:10 for thz generation and electro - optic ( eo ) sampling .",
    "the generation beam was chopped at 500 hz using an optical chopper and tilted toward the echelon as shown in the side view inset of the figure .",
    "the reflected beamlets were imaged into a right - angle ln prism with a demagnification factor of @xmath27 using either an @xmath28 cm achromatic lens or 3-element zoom - lens imaging system with @xmath29 cm , @xmath30 cm , and @xmath31 cm .",
    "the 1/@xmath32 radius of the optical pump beam at the face of the ln prism was approximately 1.0 mm .",

    "the initially smooth spectrum develops a strong @xmath34 nm spectral modulation after reflection as is expected from pulses delayed by 460 fs .",
    "the spectra were obtained by directing diffuse scattering of the light into a spectrograph .",
    "the spectrum of the light reflected from multiple echelon steps provides an accurate measure of the echelon step height , but the spectrum of any individual beamlet is that of the original pump beam , without spectral modulation .",
    "the resulting thz output was collected using a 3-inch diameter , 3-inch effective focal length ( efl ) , 90@xmath35 off - axis parabolic reflector , and focused using a 3-inch diameter , 2-inch efl parabolic reflector into a gap crystal .",
    "the eo sampling optical beam was variably delayed , attenuated using a half - wave plate and polarizer , directed through a hole in the second thz parabolic reflector , and overlapped with the thz pulse in the gap crystal .",
    "the transmitted eo sampling beam was then passed through a quarter wave plate and polarizing beam splitter , and the signals were detected using balanced photodiodes and analyzed using a national instruments data acquisition card @xcite .    5 into the ln prism . the thz output from the ln prism was collected using a pair of off - axis parabolic mirrors and focused into a 200-@xmath0 m active , 2-mm inert gap crystal pair for eo sampling .",

    "to begin characterizing the thz output of the system , we measured the thz time - dependent waveform by eo sampling and computed the corresponding fourier transform , yielding the results shown in figure [ thz_timetrace_spectrum_spotsize](a)-(b ) .",
    "the data shown were obtained using maximum pump power for the 1-lens and zoom - lens at rt and ct , and the results are summarized in table [ tab : thz_results ] below .",
    "the highest peak thz electric field ( @xmath36-field ) measured was 500 kv / cm when using 1-lens at ct . in all cases , the peak frequency was 0.63 thz and the mean frequencies ranged from 0.9 thz to 1.1 thz .",
    "our peak frequency is slightly lower than the peak frequencies typically obtained using a continuous tilted pulse front , which is likely a result of the finite size of the beamlets in the ln prism . assuming independent thz generation by each of the beamlets , an estimate of the peak thz frequency , @xmath37 , can be made ( neglecting frequency - dependent thz absorption in the ln crystal ) according to @xcite :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the thz refractive index of ln and @xmath6 is the spot size of the beamlet . using @xmath40 @xmath0 m , we find @xmath37 = 0.64 thz in almost exact agreement with our experiment .",

    "the bandwidth of the resulting thz pulses depends on the available wave vector components of the beamlets , with smaller beamlets having more content .",

    "this is plotted in figure [ pulse_energy_conv_efficiency_spectra](c ) , and shows significant spectral broadening as well as a red - shift in the center wavelength of the modulated spectrum .",
    "this red - shift is characteristic of the thz generation process @xcite , which occurs through difference - frequency mixing among the optical spectral components @xcite and which can be cascaded through multiple difference - frequency steps , leading greater than 100% photon conversion efficiencies .      in comparing the measured conversion efficiencies ,",
    "the 1-lens and zoom - lens imaging systems show markedly different behavior with respect to pump pulse energy . at both rt and ct ,",
    "the 1-lens system conversion efficiency appears to saturate , while the zoom - lens system conversion efficiency increases due to continued superlinear growth .",
    "in addition , the 1-lens system shows a noticeable increase in the thz bandwidth at ct as a result of the dramatic reduction in thz absorption at higher frequencies @xcite , while the bandwidth obtained from the zoom - lens system does not noticeably change . this behavior could be due to the larger divergence and wavevector spread of the beamlets with the 1-lens imaging system , which would allow phase matching over a wider range of frequencies as described in in sec . 3.1 .",
    "in contrast , the divergence of the beamlets is diffraction limited with the zoom - lens system , and hence there is negligible change in the generated bandwidth .",
    "the beam divergence in the 1-lens system also leads to a range of tilt angles that expands more rapidly in front and back of the image plane . while this may diminish the overall conversion efficiency , it may at the same time increase conversion into higher - frequency thz spectral components .",
    "our thz generation system has some similarities to a phased antenna array @xcite . treating each beamlet as an element of such an array ,",
    "the superposition of thz waves along the cherenkov angle is reduced when @xmath43 @xmath0 m or @xmath44 thz , as energy is diffracted into higher orders by the imposed periodic structure .",
    "a smaller echelon step width may therefore improve the conversion efficiency by reducing the amount of diffraction of high frequency waves .",
    "this would require a proportional reduction in the step height .",
    "the reductions would ultimately be limited by the pulse duration since for pulses with durations @xmath45 , it is possible that the echelon would act as an echelle grating that produces a beam with low angular dispersion because of its significantly reduced groove density . in that case",
    ", the larger demagnification used here ( @xmath46 ) would increase the angular dispersion to be the same as that from a conventional grating . at the image plane the pump pulse from the echelon",
    "would therefore suffer the same degradation , limiting the generation efficiency .",
    "our assumptions that the discrete tilted pulse front properties are insensitive to the pump pulse duration and that each beamlet acts as an independent line source in the ln crystal , with a rayleigh range given by its spot size , would no longer be valid in this limit .",
    "careful theoretical treatment of thz generation using a continuous tilted pulse front from a grating has shown that the dramatic modification of the pump spectrum is significantly influenced by the nonlinear coupling between the thz and optical fields which candramatically reduce the effective thz generation length @xcite .",
    "similar calculations are under way for the echelon generation that we have demonstrated here , and the results may help understand the limitations that are faced in this approach .",
    "we have demonstrated efficient thz generation using an easily implemented 800-nm discrete tilted pulse front produced by a reflective stair - step echelon structure .",
    "we produced thz pulses with field strengths as high as 500 kv / cm and pulse energies exceeding 3 @xmath0j .",
    "the peak conversion efficiency at cryogenic temperature was 0.33% , which is an improvement over values routinely reported in the literature for sub-100 fs pulse durations .",
    "further improvements to the echelon could be made to increase the thz output , such as reducing the step width to facilitate the generation of higher frequencies .",
    "it is worth noting that higher conversion efficiencies have been observed using even longer transform - limited pulses at 1030 nm center wavelength @xcite .",
    "when generating using 1030 nm , saturation of the conversion efficiency occurs at higher intensity because free carriers are generated by four - photon absorption , rather than three - photon absorption at 800 nm @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the high conversion efficiencies for these longer transform - limited pulses were attributed mainly to the reduced pump pulse bandwidth , which increases the coherence length and decreases the effects from stimulated raman scattering @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the use of an echelon would allow shorter pump pulse durations to be used at similar pump wavelengths , resulting in high conversion efficiencies with greater thz bandwidths .",

    "<S> we present a novel method for thz generation in lithium niobate using a reflective stair - step echelon structure . </S>",
    "<S> the echelon produces a discretely tilted pulse front with less angular dispersion compared to a high groove - density grating . </S>",
    "<S> the thz output was characterized using both a 1-lens and 3-lens imaging system to set the tilt angle at room and cryogenic temperatures . using broadband 800 nm pulses with a pulse energy of 0.95 mj and a pulse duration of 70 fs ( 24 nm fwhm bandwidth , 39 fs transform limited width ) , we produced thz pulses with field strengths as high as 500 kv / cm and pulse energies as high as 3.1 @xmath0j . </S>",
    "<S> the highest conversion efficiency we obtained was 0.33% . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that the echelon is easily implemented into an experimental setup for quick alignment and optimization . </S>"
