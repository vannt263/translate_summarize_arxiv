    "scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments on surfaces of the high temperature cuprate superconductor bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath4  ( bscco ) provide a powerful tool for probing strong electronic correlations in this material.@xcite since the stm measures a local density of states ( ldos ) with a high real - space resolution it is widely used for studying impurity effects in @xmath0-wave superconductors ( sc ) . @xcite",
    "extensive stm studies have been performed on both magnetic ni and non - magnetic zn impurities in bscco .",
    "particularly interesting is the zn resonant state , i.e. , a large peak in the differential conductance ( i.e. , in the ldos ) at small but finite energy which is mainly localized near the zn site.@xcite despite the fact that there are numerous theoretical studies dealing with the resonant state induced by non - magnetic impurities in @xmath0-wave cuprates , no consensus on the theoretical description has been reached yet.@xcite    the zn@xmath5 impurity has spin @xmath6 and it might be natural to describe it as a delta - function potential scatterer within a potential scattering ( ps ) model.@xcite in the ps model the resonance peak can be identified with a quasibound state whose energy can be tuned by varying the strength of the potential .",
    "however , a low - energy state appears only for large potential values , i.e. , in the unitary limit .",
    "moreover , some experimental findings can not be easily explained within the ps model like the spatial dependence of the resonance peak which shows a global maximum on the zn site and local maxima on the next - nearest neighbor cu sites.@xcite    nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments are another powerful probe of strongly correlated systems like cuprates . in a series of nmr experiments",
    "it has been established that each non - magnetic impurity ( e.g. , zn@xmath5 or li@xmath7 ) induces a net local @xmath8 moment that is distributed on the cu ions in its vicinity.@xcite furthermore , the effective induced moment interacts with the elementary excitations of the bulk material giving rise to kondo - like physics which has indeed been observed in nmr experiments.@xcite consequently , one can treat a non - magnetic zn impurity in the @xmath0-wave sc within the kondo model and identify the low - energy impurity state in the stm spectra with the kondo resonance.@xcite however , it is still not completely settled whether the potential scattering or the kondo - like description is more appropriate for modeling the non - magnetic impurities in the cuprates and for explaining all experimental facts.@xcite the main objective of the present study is to resolve this question . in principle , kondo - like behavior should be suppressed by an external magnetic field which would allow to identify the origin of the observed impurity stm signal .",
    "so far , no such experiments have been performed and it has been shown that for this purpose rather high magnetic fields would be needed.@xcite    recently the stm measurements on bscco have revealed the presence of nanoscale electronic inhomogeneities which show up as spatial modulation of both the gap amplitude and the ldos.@xcite these electronic inhomogeneities and variations of the ldos attracted numerous theoretical and experimental studies.@xcite random out - of - plane dopant atoms which change the pair interaction locally@xcite and a competing order like antiferromagnetism@xcite have been proposed to be a possible origin of the ldos modulations in the cuprates .",
    "importantly , the stm studies on bscco have identified two distinct electronic domains : ( i ) the domains with a small - gap magnitude and with well - developed sc coherence peaks and ( ii ) the large - gap domains without sc coherence peaks .",
    "remarkably , in the presence of impurities it was observed that impurity resonances are present only in the small - gap domains and no impurity resonances can be detected in the large - gap domains.@xcite using this experimental fact and motivated by the question about the origin of the impurity resonance in @xmath0-wave cuprate sc we investigate how the resonance state is influenced by putting the impurity into different domains of the sc host in both the ps model and in the kondo model . to get quantitative results we employ a @xmath1-matrix and a large-@xmath2 approach for the ps and the kondo model , respectively .",
    "we conclude that the zn impurity resonance in bscco has predominantly a kondo - like character .",
    "very recently a new possibility for the origin of the zn resonance peak in bscco has been proposed.@xcite namely , in @xmath0-wave sc short - ranged off - diagonal ( @xmath9 ) impurities generate low - energy andreev states which are then associated with the impurity resonance seen in the stm spectra .",
    "if the usual @xmath10 impurity scattering is absent , the andreev resonant state exists symmetrically around the fermi level . however , by including a weak @xmath10 potential this symmetry is broken .",
    "this gives results which bear closer resemblance to the stm data .",

    "we consider an effective impurity hamiltonian which consists of a potential scattering and a magnetic term , @xmath28 .",
    "the potential scattering term describes electrostatic interactions between the impurity atom and the conduction electrons whereas the magnetic term represents an impurity moment embedded in the sc host .",
    "we assume that the potential scattering is completely localized at the impurity site @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 .",

    "a spin gap @xmath55 corresponds to a bulk quantum - critical point controlling a transition between a quantum paramagnet ( @xmath56 ) and the antiferromagnetically ordered phase.@xcite    in the present study the kondo hamiltonian describes the physics of the so - called pseudogap ( i.e. , softgap ) bose - fermi kondo model.@xcite there , a fermionic ldos follows a power - law close to the fermi energy , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is measured from the fermi level .",

    "it is important to note that this local green s function is the only input quantity representing the bulk material ; it differs significantly in the small - gap and the large - gap regions of the sc host ( more details are given in sec .",

    "to obtain quantitative results in the bose - fermi kondo model we use the large-@xmath2 formalism .",

    "we have investigated how the stm impurity resonant state is influenced when the sc host is chosen in such a way that it resembles the nanoscale electronic inhomogeneities seen by stm.@xcite ( i ) if the impurity atom is assumed to be a pure potential scatterer we have shown within the @xmath1-matrix approach that the impurity resonance appears as a robust feature .",
    "the resonant state is rather insensitive to changes of the sc host .",
    "it is present in both small- and large - gap regions which is in disagreement with the experimental data .",
    "( ii ) the suppression of the impurity resonance in the large - gap domains observed by stm can be naturally explained by assuming that the impurity atom gives rise to kondo - type physics .",
