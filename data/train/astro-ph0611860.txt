    "the rate of soft gamma - ray repeater ( sgr ) giant flares and their fraction among short - duration gamma ray bursts ( grb ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "1993 ) are important ingredients for the understanding of giant flares in the context of the magnetar model ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; paczynski 1992 ; for a recent review see woods & thompson 2006 ) .",
    "the large energy release from the 2004 december 27 giant flare , combined with some similarities between the temporal and spectral properties of giant flares and short grbs , has re - ignited the idea that some or all of the short grbs are in fact sgr giant flares in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , dar 2005 ; hurley et al .",
    "2005 ; palmer et al .",
    "2005 ; nakar et al .",
    "additional support to this hypothesis came from the observed galactic rate of giant flares with energy above @xmath12  erg , of one in 30  years among four active galactic sgrs .",
    "a limit on the fraction of sgrs among short grbs was obtained by nakar et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who searched the error quadrilateral of six , well - localized , inter - planetary network ( ipn ) grbs for relatively nearby galaxies .",
    "they put a upper limit of @xmath16 ( @xmath10 confidence limit ; cl ) on the fraction of sgrs among bright short grbs .",
    "lazzati , ghirlanda , & ghisellini ( 2005 ) , inspected the spectra of 76 burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) short bursts .",
    "they found three grbs whose spectra are well described by a black body model , and @xmath17 bursts for which a fit with a black body model is not excluded .",
    "lazzati et al .",
    "( 2005 ) then argued , based on the gamma - ray light curves of these short grbs , that none of them were likely sgr bursts .",
    "they derived a limit on the fraction of sgr bursts among bright batse events of @xmath18 ( @xmath10 cl ) .",
    "i note that the lazzati et al .",
    "( 2005 ) results are based on the assumption that all the giant flares have similar light curves . however , this assumption is based on a small number of observed giant flares .",
    "if i relax the lazzati et al .",
    "( 2005 ) assumption about the temporal characteristics of giant flares , but keep their assumption regarding the spectral properties of sgrs ( and there are up to 18 sgr flares in their sample ) , their result poses an upper limit on the fraction of sgrs among bright short grbs of @xmath19 , at the @xmath10 cl .",
    "recently , two possible detections of extragalactic sgrs were claimed : crider ( 2006 ) detected a @xmath20  s periodicity in the tail of the gamma - ray light curve of grb  970110 .",
    "he suggested that this burst may be an sgr flare in ngc  6946 .",
    "golenetskii et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported the detection of grb  051103 , which includes the nearby galaxy m81 in its error quadrilateral ( see ofek et al .",
    "2006 and frederiks et al .",
    "2006 for follow - up observations and discussion ) .",
    "another quantity related to the fraction of sgrs among short grbs is the rate of sgr giant flares .",
    "this rate is the consequence of the total energy available for sgrs , which in the context of the magnetar model is provided by the magnetic field of neutron star .",
    "recently , stella et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argued that the rate of sgr giant flares , with energy above @xmath21  erg , is about @xmath22  yr@xmath14 .",
    "they obtained this result by using a uniform prior ( see however , duncan 2001 ) on the observed rate .",
    "they further argued that about 70 giant flares , with energy above @xmath21  erg , are expected during the lifetime of an sgr , and concluded that magnetic fields of @xmath23  g are needed in order to explain the energy source of sgrs .",
    "popov & stern ( 2005 ) attempted to find extragalactic sgrs by searching the batse catalog for short grbs that spatially coincide with the virgo cluster .",
    "they used this search to put an upper limit on the rate of giant flares with energy above @xmath24  erg , of @xmath25  yr@xmath14 .",
    "however , this limit was obtained by assuming that @xmath26 of all sgr giant flares is in the range of 0.05 to 0.7  s , and by ignoring the batse positional uncertainty .",
    "a similar limit was obtained by palmer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    in this paper",
    "i match the ipn (  [ ipn ] ) short grbs with nearby galaxies (  [ sample ] ) .",
    "contrary to previous efforts , i do not introduce any assumptions about the temporal or spectral properties of sgr giant flares .",
    "i present , in  [ search ] , the search for ipn short - duration grbs that spatially coincide with nearby galaxies . in",
    " [ rate ] , i use the results of this search to calculate the rate of sgr giant flares and confront it with the rate estimated based on the galactic sgrs .",

    "the inter - planetary network ( ipn ; e.g. , laros et al .",
    "1997 ; hurley et al . 1999 ) is a set of gamma - ray detectors on board several spacecraft in the solar system .",
    "the ipn uses grb photon arrival times to triangulate their celestial positions .",
    "each pair of spacecraft constrain the grb position to an annulus on the celestial sphere .",
    "the area of ipn @xmath1-@xmath2 error regions is typically two orders of magnitude smaller than batse error circles .",
    "in fact , ipn positions were used to calibrate batse positional errors ( briggs et al .",
    "1999 ) .",

    "this is based on the fact konus / wind started to work only in 1994 ( 11  yrs out of 15  yrs ) , and the exposure completeness of batse , which worked 4  yrs without konus / wind , is about @xmath30 .",
    "the dashed line shows an approximation to this completeness function given by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fluence .",

    "a catalog of short grbs detected by konus / wind was published by mazets et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , however , some of the grbs in this catalog were classified as long grbs by batse .",
    "therefore , instead of using this catalog i used the following statistical approach : i inspected by eye the konus / wind light curves for which an ipn annulus constraint is available , and selected all the bursts that have a total duration of less than two  seconds . due to the differences between the batse and konus / wind detectors , this sample is contaminated by long grbs ( which appear like short grbs for the konus / wind detector ) .",

[ n_i_sgr ] ) is subject to errors through the sn rate estimate , and to poisson error in the number of active sgrs in the galaxy ( @xmath227 ; @xmath10 cl ) ; the distance to sgr  1806@xmath3520 may be smaller than @xmath17  kpc ( e.g. , 12kpc , figer et al . 2004 ; 610  kpc , cameron et al .",
    "2005 ) , and therefore shifting the dark - gray zone ( i.e. , energy of the 2004 december 27 giant flare ) in fig .",
    "[ e_gf_e_max ] to the left ; moreover , the value of the power - law index @xmath174 may be different from @xmath228 ( e.g. , gtz et al .",
    "2006 ; @xmath229 ) , and the luminosity function model is an approximation . in reality the energy distribution ( i.e. , @xmath230 ) is probably not terminated abruptly at @xmath163 , as different sgrs may be born with different magnetic fields .",
    "i note that although the tentative detection of a single extragalactic sgr has a large poisson uncertainty ( @xmath231 , at the @xmath10 cl ) , the actual rate can not be much smaller than one , or it will not be consistent with the observed galactic rate of giant flares with energy above @xmath34  erg .",
    "interestingly , the galactic rate of giant flares with energy above @xmath232  erg is @xmath233  yr@xmath14 per sgr ( the errors are the 1 and 2-@xmath2 cl , respectively ; assuming three66 ) ; 1998 august 27 ( sgr  1900@xmath23414 ) ; and 2004 december 27 ( sgr  1806@xmath3520 ) .",
    "note that , sgr flares are correlated ( see also  [ disc ] ) and therefore poisson statistics can be used only if the flares were originated from different objects  as in this case . ]",
    "giant flares were observed in 30  yrs ) .",
    "this rate is indicated by the error - bar in the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ e_gf_e_max ] .",
    "the solid line is the @xmath181-@xmath2 ci , and the dashed line is the @xmath219-@xmath2 ci implied by the galactic rate . in order to reconcile the galactic rate with the extragalactic rate , a gradual break ( or steepening ) in the flare energy distribution",
    "is required at @xmath235  erg ( at the @xmath10 cl ) .",
    "i note that if i adopt the value of @xmath229 found by gtz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , then the inferred rate of giant flares with energy above @xmath12  erg will be even lower ( by about @xmath236 ) than the rate based on @xmath167 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath229 i find that @xmath237 , at the @xmath10  cl .",
    "to conclude , this analysis shows that : @xmath238  erg at the @xmath10 cl ; the rate of sgr giant flares is @xmath13  yr@xmath14 per sgr ; and the fraction of sgr flares among short - duration grbs can not be much smaller than one percent , otherwise it will be inconsistent with the galactic rate .",
    "the fraction of sgr flares among short grbs and the rate of sgr giant flares are closely related issues . measurements of these quantities are important for the understanding of the sgr flare mechanism and magnetic field strength .",
    "below i discuss the possibility of observing additional extragalactic flares and the implications of the measured sgr giant flare rate for the magnetic field strength in the context of the magnetar model .",
    "the derived fraction of sgrs among short grbs implies that about five to @xmath239 extragalactic sgr flares were observed by batse .",
    "moreover , i estimate that the swift satellite may find an extragalactic sgr every several years , and that the gamma - ray large area space telescope will localize about @xmath211@xmath1 extragalactic sgrs per year .",
    "based on the analysis presented in this paper , it would be surprising if both grb  000420b and the recently discovered grb  051103 ( golenetskii et al .",
    "2005 ; ofek et al . 2006 ; frederiks et al .",
    "2006 ) were not associated with m74 and m81 , respectively .",
    "verifying that a grb is indeed an extragalactic sgr flare requires either the detection of persistent x - ray emission , which is beyond our current observational capabilities , or the detection of additional flare activity .",
    "the fact that sgr flares are correlated may increase the probability of observing additional flare activity from extragalactic sgrs .",
    "the observed time between low - energy sgr flares follows a log - normal distribution ( laros et al . 1987 ; hurley et al .",
    "1994 ; cheng et al .",
    "therefore , it is more appropriate to express the typical time between bursts using the log - normal - mean , @xmath240 , and -standard deviation , @xmath241 . assuming a flare rate of @xmath220  yr@xmath14 , then @xmath242 , the expectation value of the time between giant flares , with energy above @xmath34  erg , is @xmath243  yr . since the expectancy value of log - normal distribution is given by @xmath244 , and assuming @xmath245 ( hurley et al .",
    "1994 ) is independent of energy , the log mean for giant flares is @xmath246 .",
    "interestingly , the cumulative log - normal distribution suggests that given these parameters ( i.e. , @xmath247 ; @xmath245 ) , the probability to observe a second giant flare of an sgr within ten years from the first flare ( given a sufficient energy source ) is @xmath248 .",
    "therefore , if grb  000420b is associated with m74 , and/or grb  051103 is associated with m81 , there is a fair chance to see another flare from these galaxies in the next decade .",
    "furthermore , i note that if more than one burst per sgr will be observed , the use of poisson statistics will considerably overestimate the flare rate .    as discussed in  [ introduction ] , stella et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argued that about 70 giant flares , with energy above @xmath21  erg , are expected from an sgr during its life - time , and claimed that sgr magnetic fields are in excess of @xmath249  g. my analysis , however , shows that the giant flare rate is two orders of magnitude smaller than that estimated by stella et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and therefore , magnetic fields of @xmath250  g can provide the required energy source .",
    "the giant flare rate i derive , @xmath13  yr@xmath14 per sgr , suggests that within the lifetime of an sgr , @xmath251-@xmath252  yrs , it would have of order unity giant flares with energy above @xmath12  erg",
    ".    to summarize , i searched for a spatial coincidence of ipn grbs with galaxies within 20  mpc .",
    "i have found a single sgr candidate , possibly located within m74 .",
    "however , this match could be a chance coincidence .",
    "currently , the best way to test the hypothesis that grb  000420b arose in m74 is to detect additional sgr flares from this galaxy . as sgr activity",
    "is correlated , the expected waiting time to a second flare from the same sgr is not necessarily long .",
    "i use the results to place an upper limit on the fraction of sgrs among short grbs with fluence above @xmath6  erg  @xmath7 , of @xmath8 at the @xmath10 cl .",
    "this limit is consistent with the recent finding of nakar et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and lazzati et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , but contrary to the latter paper it does not depend on the assumption that all sgr giant flares have the same light curve and spectrum .",
    "i note that this limit is based on the assumption that magnetars form predominantly in young stellar populations ( see however levan et al .",
    "i roughly estimate the efficiency of the ipn to detect giant flares in each of the galaxies in the sample , and find that the rate of giant flares , with energy above @xmath34  erg , is @xmath13  yr@xmath14 per sgr .",
    "finally , i show that the sgr flare luminosity function is consistent with a single power - law with a gradual cutoff or steepening below @xmath253  erg ( @xmath254  erg ) , at the @xmath10 cl , for @xmath167 ( @xmath255 ) .",
