    "is a symbiotic recurrent nova ( rn ) which had previously undergone recorded outbursts in 1898 , 1933 , 1958 , 1967 and 1985 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with possible additional outbursts in 1907 @xcite and 1945 @xcite . on 2006 february 12.83ut",
    "it was observed to be undergoing a further eruption @xcite , reaching magnitude v=4.5 at this time . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we define this as @xmath6 .",
    "the optical light curve then began a rapid decline , very similar to that seen in previous outbursts ( @xcite , aavso ) .",
    "several lines of evidence are consistent with a distance to rs oph of @xmath7 kpc @xcite .",
    "the rs oph binary system comprises a red giant star in a @xmath8 day orbit with a white dwarf ( wd ) of mass near the chandrasekhar limit ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "accretion of hydrogen - rich material from the red giant onto the wd surface leads to the conditions for a thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) in a similar fashion to that for classical novae ( cne ) . the much shorter inter - outburst period for this type of rn compared to cne is thought to be due to a combination of the high wd mass and a supposed high accretion rate ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such models lead to the ejection of somewhat lower masses at higher velocities than those for models of cn ( typically 5000 km s@xmath4 and @xmath9m@xmath10 respectively for rne ) .",
    "spectroscopy of rs oph has indeed shown h@xmath11 line emission with fwhm @xmath12 km s@xmath4 and fwzi @xmath13 km s@xmath4 on 2006 february 14.2 ( @xmath14 days , @xcite ) .",
    "unlike cne , where the mass donor is a low - mass main - sequence star , the presence of the red giant in the rs oph system means that the high velocity ejecta run into a dense circumstellar medium in the form of the red giant wind , setting up a shock system with gas temperatures @xmath15k for @xmath16 km s@xmath4 , where @xmath17 is the velocity of the forward shock running into the pre - existing wind .",
    "x - ray observations of the 2006 outburst by @xcite and @xcite have confirmed the basic shock model of @xcite and @xcite in which rs oph evolves like a supernova remnant ( snr ) , but on timescales around @xmath18 times faster .",
    "vlbi imaging at 6 cm and 18 cm began 13.8 days after outburst @xcite .",
    "the initial image showed a partial ring of non - thermal ( synchrotron ) emission , of radius 13.8 au at @xmath2 kpc , consistent with emission from the forward shock .",
    "subsequently , more extended lobes aligned e - w gradually emerged , with that in the east appearing first .",
    "this morphology was consistent with that derived from more rudimentary vlbi observations 77 days after the 1985 outburst by @xcite , apparently showing jets of emission .",
    "@xcite proposed a simple geometrical model comprising an expanding double - lobed structure , with the major axis perpendicular to the proposed plane of the central binary orbit .",
    "here we report hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) observations of the expanding nebular remnant taken at @xmath19d and compare them to the structures seen earlier in the radio .",
    "we then go on to explore remnant geometry by comparison to a bipolar model and thus deduce more about the circumstances of the outburst and the wider implications of these results .",
    "rs oph was observed ( prop .",
    "i d 11004 ) in director s discretionary time 155 days after outburst on 2006 july 17 using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the _ hst_. the 0.025pixel@xmath4 high - resolution channel ( hrc ) was used for the observations combined with three narrow - band filters to isolate the h@xmath11+[nii ]  ( filter f658n ) , [ oiii ]  @xmath05007  ( f502n ) and [ nev ]  @xmath03426  ( f343n ) nebular emission lines .",
    "in order to reduce readout overheads and maximise on - object time , the 512x512 square pixel subarray was used throughout .",
    "one orbit was spent imaging rs oph , while a second was used to observe hd 166215 , a bright nearby standard star of comparable spectral type ( v = 9.32 , k0 ) . with limited time for the rs oph observations",
    ", a balance was struck between deep imaging and dithering to increase resolution .",
    "care was taken when planning the exposures not to saturate either the primary target or standard star images in any filter .",
    "the resulting images were checked and verified as unsaturated in every case .",
    "observations of rs oph were repeated with a 3  offset in both ra and declination in order to identify and eliminate ghosts if present .",
    "a two point dither pattern was used for each observation .",
    "table 1 summarises the resulting observations of each target .",
    "all data were reprocessed using standard procedures outlined in the acs data handbook and the pydrizzle and multidrizzle handbooks , using optimal input parameters to maximise the signal to noise ratio of each image . although extended emission was clearly visible in the unprocessed [ oiii ]  images , a number of data analysis techniques were used in order to explore in detail the presence of extended emission in the images for each filter .",
    "psf profiles generated by _",
    "@xcite were then subtracted from the rs oph data in each of the emission lines .",
    "the psf was scaled to an extent such that when subtracted , it brought the formerly peak pixel value to approximately the same level as those surrounding it .",
    "after subtraction , the total counts over an area enclosing the central star ( as a percentage of the pre - subtracted values ) are 92% ( [ oiii ]  and [ nev ] ) and 65% ( h@xmath11 ) .",
    "it is likely therefore that there is some residual stellar flux in the central regions of the psf - subtracted images .    using the profile of hd 166215 as the psf , and",
    "also that generated by _ tinytim _",
    ", deconvolution using the lucy - richardson method was performed on the rs oph data for each emission line .",
    "tests using both the clean and maximum entropy techniques produced similar results .",
    "however , for [ nev ] the lower signal - to - noise of the stellar psf meant that only the _ tinytim _ psf could be used effectively in the deconvolution . as part of this study , a re - analysis was carried out of pre - outburst wfpc2 observations of the [ oiii ]  @xmath05007  line through the 502n filter on 2000 june 12 ( prop .",
    "i d 8332 ) .",
    "no extended emission , even at very faint levels , was detectable .",
    "this confirms the results of the analysis of these data undertaken by @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ images ] , extended structure was clearly visible in the [ oiii ]  @xmath05007  line in the psf - subtracted image ( and was indeed visible in the raw image ) .",
    "deconvolution revealed more detailed structure in both [ oiii ]  and [ nev ]  @xmath03426 .",
    "there was also a hint of possible extended emission close to the central source in the h@xmath11 line , but this was not present at a significant level .    in the deconvolved [ oiii ]  and [ nev ]  images ,",
    "the most striking feature is a double ring structure with major axis lying e - w and total ( peak - to - peak ) extent @xmath20 mas ( @xmath1 au at @xmath2 kpc ) .",
    "the most extended structures seen in the radio ( the outer lobes ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) lie along this axis . assuming ejection at the time of the outburst , the expansion rate ( from the center ) of the optical emission along this axis is @xmath21 mas d@xmath4 ( equivalent to @xmath3 km s@xmath4 in the plane of the sky ) .",
    "the optical emission is also detectable above background in the deconvolved images to a total extent of @xmath22 mas , corresponding to an expansion rate of @xmath23 mas d@xmath4 .",
    "we may compare this to 1.4 @xmath24 mas d@xmath4 for the e - w lobes seen in the radio , taken over 4 epochs from @xmath25 to 62.7 days in the 2006 outburst ( obrien et al .",
    ", in preparation ) and 1.3 mas d@xmath4 for the equivalent features derived from vlbi observations in the 1985 outburst @xcite .",
    "thus there is evidence that the bipolar emission seen here and in the radio arises from the same regions of the remnant , if the expansion velocities in the e - w direction are roughly constant over the first 155 days .    tracing the ring - like structure of the optical remnant suggests a n - s ( peak - to - peak ) extent of @xmath26 mas .",
    "this corresponds to an expansion rate of @xmath27 mas d@xmath4 compared with @xmath28 mas d@xmath4 derived in the radio for the central ring on day 13.8 @xcite .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the formal error on this radio expansion rate is likely to be an underestimate ; @xcite also derived radio expansion rates for the ring @xmath29% higher",
    ". thus comparison of the hst and radio data tentatively suggests deceleration in the n - s direction , but verification awaits further optical observations .",
    "as noted above , both [ oiii ]  and [ nev ]  show similar structure . in the case of both lines , emission might arise either from regions downstream of the forward shock in the red giant wind or from a `` precursor '' ionised region ahead of the shock , or both ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the more marginal presence of h@xmath11+[nii ]  may be a direct consequence of particular shock velocities ( again see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) coupled with decreasing contrast of extended emission with the central star at longer wavelengths .",
    "it is also of interest to note that the assumption from @xmath30 observations of infrared fine structure and coronal lines @xcite of an origin of these lines in the same remnant regions is consistent with our observations .",
    "@xcite proposed a simple model for the radio emission comprising a bipolar structure where the evolution of the optical depth due to free - free absorption led to the gradual uncovering of various features , most notably this explained the emergence of the outermost radio lobes . here",
    ", we have modeled the optical emission seen in our hst images with a `` peanut - shaped '' bipolar structure using the modeling code described in @xcite ( see figure  [ model ] ) .",
    "the shell has finite thickness ( @xmath31 arcsec ) and the surface brightness distribution is just determined by the line - of - sight path length through the nebula .",
    "the axial ratio is set at 3:1 , consistent with a constant velocity of expansion along the major axis and deceleration along the `` waist '' , as implied by the earlier radio observations .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ model ] , the model reproduces the morphology of the optical emission extremely well for an inclination @xmath32 , consistent with the major axis lying normal to the plane of the binary orbit , where @xmath33 was given by @xcite from radial velocity studies .",
    "following @xcite , we also note that the 2006 outburst occurred at approximately the same binary phase as in 1985 , and hence the similarity between the rate of expansion of the radio lobes on the plane of the sky in the two outbursts would naturally follow .",
    "we now turn our attention briefly to the features to the e and s of the main remnant ( figure  [ images ] ) .",
    "the eastern `` arc '' , which is apparent only in the [ oiii ]  image , has no counterpart detectable to the w and its closest approach to the centre of the bipolar emission is @xmath34 arcsec .",
    "similarly , the southern `` blob '' ( also detected in h@xmath11 ) lies at @xmath35 arcsec from the centre .",
    "if these features arose in the 2006 outburst , for @xmath2 kpc , they would therefore imply @xmath36 and @xmath37 km s@xmath4 respectively , values far higher than those otherwise observed or expected in such an outburst . on the other hand , at this time , one might expect light echoes in the surrounding medium to have radial extent far greater than this ( @xmath38 arcsec , for a scattering medium in the plane of the sky at the distance of the nova ) .",
    "another possibility is that these features are in fact associated with material piling up from previous outbursts .",
    "future hst observations will help to clarify their origin , and also explore the late - time evolution of the remnant .",
    "we have detected , in at least two emission lines , the resolved optical counterparts of the expanding emission first seen much earlier in the outburst at radio wavelengths .",
    "the central remnant is then modeled in terms of a bipolar structure whose inclination is consistent with that of the binary orbit . for @xmath39 kpc @xcite , @xmath32 , an expansion velocity , @xmath5 km s@xmath4 and @xmath40 km s@xmath4 are implied for the material at the poles ( the formal errors being dominated by the uncertainty in distance here ) .",
    "unless the ejection of material at the explosion site is highly anisotropic ( which appears unlikely ) this reinforces the notion that remnant shaping occurs due to the interaction of the ejecta with the pre - existing circumstellar environment .",
    "the implication would then be that the densest parts of the red giant wind lie in the equatorial regions along the plane of the binary orbit .",
    "this in turn leads to more marked deceleration of material in this direction compared to the poles .",
    "the existence of a dense region of the wind , which has not been fully traversed by a forward shock ( even at these relatively late times ) may well explain the apparent presence of dust in the circumstellar environment throughout the outburst ( evans et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "it is from this dense equatorial region that we now suspect most of the early x - ray emission also arises as the forward shock driven into this region by the outburst ejecta decelerates .",
    "the rapid evolution of the remnant derived by @xcite is consistent with this proposal .",
    "these observations have wider relevance to our understanding of the shaping of nova shells and planetary nebulae for example , @xcite have shown that the pn abell 63 comprises narrow lobes which form a `` tube '' at the ends of which are `` caps '' of emission . at the centre of abell 63 is the eclipsing close binary uu sge ( @xmath41 hrs * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xcite have demonstrated that the inclination of the lobes is that of the plane of the central binary .",
    "they conclude therefore that the pn was shaped by interaction during its early evolution with a circumbinary environment with enhanced density in the equatorial plane .",
    "this is consistent with the results of hydrodynamic modelling of the evolution of the environment of such systems performed by @xcite .",
    "although they did not extend their study to semi - detached ( rather than detached ) systems , these authors found that equatorial enhancements in the density of the winds from red giants and agb stars in binary systems were most pronounced for those with the smallest binary separations ( i.e. comparable to that in rs oph ) .",
    "recent observations by @xcite of the type ia sn 2006x show spectral features that may be associated with the interaction of the sn ejecta with multiple , slow moving shells of pre - existing material , which have been suggested to arise from a recurrent nova progenitor system .",
    "furthermore , this interpretation is aided by an anisotropic density distribution in the pre - supernova circumstellar environment , compatible with enhanced density in the equatorial plane of the progenitor binary system .    finally , it is clear that our current spherically - symmetric hydrodynamic models of the evolution of shock structures in rs ophiuchi will need revision to take account of the geometry revealed in these observations .",
    "such modeling is now underway ( vaytet et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "work also includes the analysis of a further planned epoch of hst observations to explore more details of remant evolution and which may in addition elucidate the nature of the more extended features seen in our day 155 observations . in a future paper , we hope to combine all our hst observations with contemporaneous high resolution optical spectroscopy to enable us to produce the most realistic models to - date of the true geometry of the remnant .",
    "the authors are very grateful to the _ hst _ director for provision of discretionary time and the _ hst _ support staff , in particular patricia royle and kailash sahu , for their assistance with planning and analysing the observations reported here .",
    "we thank philipp podsiadlowski and stephen justham for very informative discussions on the circumbinary environment and the link to type ia supernovae , and shazrene mohamed who directed us to the mastrodemos and morris paper .",
