    "fluctuations and correlations in statistical systems are well known to become large in the vicinity of a critical point . in this region , fluctuations have a profound influence on the macroscopic properties of the system , leading to singular thermodynamic behavior characterized by universal critical exponents and scaling functions . these power - law singularities can be traced to an underlying emerging symmetry , namely scale invariance : at the critical point , the system possesses a diverging correlation length . therefore renormalization group ( rg ) methods , which explicitly address the behavior of physical observables under scale transformations , have been employed with considerable success in describing critical fluctuations .",
    "the renormalization group provides a natural conceptual framework for explaining the occurrence of critical behavior , the emergence of universality , and the classification of different systems in terms of universality classes .",
    "moreover , rg tools ( especially in conjunction with series resummations or numerical implementations ) also enable quantitative , controlled calculations of universal properties .",
    "most successful applications of the renormalization group address systems in thermal equilibrium , where the boltzmann  gibbs probability distribution provides a solid foundation for explicit calculations .",
    "however , many systems in nature can not be cast into even an approximative equilibrium description , and a large variety of nonequilibrium systems , both relaxational and driven , also exhibit critical behavior , which should presumably also be able to be analyzed by rg techniques . unfortunately , even for nonequilibrium steady states , we presently lack a general statistical framework to construct the corresponding probability distributions and hence obtain the relevant macroscopic quantities . consequently , there are relatively few cases where such explicit calculations can be developed , at least to date . for systems that can be represented in terms of stochastic partial differential equations of the langevin type ,",
    "there exists a well - established mapping to a field - theoretic representation @xcite .",
    "this inherently coarse - grained , mesoscopic approach relies on an _ a priori _ identification of the relevant slow degrees of freedom . moreover , far from equilibrium there are no einstein relations that constrain the generalized stochastic forces or noise terms in these langevin equations .",
    "thus , although the functional form of the noise correlations may crucially affect the long - time , long - wavelength properties , it often needs to be inferred from phenomenological considerations , or simply guessed .",
    "fortunately , in certain cases an alternative approach exists which allows these fundamental difficulties to be at least partially overcome .",
    "this method relies on the introduction of a ` second quantized ' ladder operator formulation @xcite for certain classical master equations , and on the coherent state representation to construct the statistical path integral @xcite .",
    "this in principle permits a mapping to a field theory starting directly from a microscopically defined stochastic process without invoking any further assumptions or approximations beyond taking the appropriate continuum limit . in this way",
    ", the difficulties of identifying the slow variables , and of guessing the noise correlations , are circumvented , and a field theory can be straightforwardly derived .",
    "subsequently , the entire standard field - theoretic machinery can then be brought to bear , and progress made on understanding the role of fluctuations , and on identifiying and computing universal quantities .",
    "( as a cautionary note we add , though , that the above - mentioned continuum limit may not always be trivial and benign , and occasionally additional physical insight needs to be invoked to obtain an appropriate _ effective _ field theory description . ) in this overview , we will concentrate on the application of field - theoretic rg techniques to the nonequilibrium dynamics of reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "such models consist of classical particles on a lattice , which evolve by hopping between sites according to some specified transition probabilities .",
    "the particles can also interact , either being created or destroyed on a given site following prescribed reaction rules ( for general reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , in order to successfully employ rg methods to these systems , one necessary feature is a mean - field theory that is valid for some parameter range , typically when the spatial dimension @xmath4 exceeds an _ upper critical dimension _",
    "this property renders the renormalization group flows accessible within perturbation theory , via a dimensional expansion in @xmath2 . for reaction - diffusion models this requirement is usually easily satisfied , since the mean - field theory is straightforwardly given by the ` classical ' rate equations of chemical kinetics .",
    "it is the purpose of this topical review to provide an introduction to the methods of the field - theoretic rg in reaction - diffusion systems , and to survey the body of work that has emerged in this field over the last decade or so .",
    "other theoretical and numerical simulation approaches will not be as systematically covered , though various results will be mentioned as the context requires .",
    "a review by mattis and glasser @xcite also concerns reaction - diffusion models via doi s representation , but does not address the rg methods presented here .",
    "recent overviews by hinrichsen @xcite and dor @xcite are primarily concerned with classifying universality classes in nonequilibrium reaction - diffusion phase transitions via monte carlo simulations .",
    "we will also touch on this topic in our review ( for brief summaries of the rg approach to this problem , see also refs .",
    "the field theory approach to directed and dynamic isotropic percolation , as based on a mesoscopic description in terms of langevin stochastic equations of motion , is discussed in depth in ref .  @xcite . as with the previous reviews ,",
    "our presentation will concentrate on theoretical developments .",
    "unfortunately , experiments investigating fluctuations in reaction - diffusion systems are deplorably rare .",
    "three notable exceptions are : ( i ) the unambiguous observation of a @xmath5 density decay ( in an intermediate time window ) for the diffusion - limited fusion process @xmath6 , as realized in the kinetics of laser - induced excitons in quasi one - dimensional n(ch@xmath7)@xmath8mncl@xmath7 ( tmmc ) polymer chains @xcite ; ( ii ) the demonstration of non - classical @xmath9 kinetics , with an asymptotic @xmath10 density decay in three dimensions in a calcium / fluorophore system @xcite ; and ( iii ) the identification of directed percolation critical exponents in studies of spatio - temporal intermittency in ferrofluidic spikes @xcite .",
    "the review is organized as follows .",
    "the following section provides a basic introduction to reaction - diffusion models and the various approaches employed for their investigation .",
    "describes the mapping of classical reaction - diffusion models onto a field theory , while presents the rg techniques in the context of the @xmath0 @xmath11 annihilation reaction .",
    "a selection of other single - species reactions is treated in , where variations such as lvy flight propagation and the influence of disorder are also considered .",
    "in addition , this section covers the two - species annihilation reaction @xmath12 with homogeneous and segregated initial conditions , as well as with disorder and shear flow .",
    "other multi - species reactions that exhibit similar asymptotic decay are also discussed here .",
    "deals with directed percolation , branching - annihilating random walks , and other examples of nonequilibrium phase transitions between active and inactive / absorbing states .",
    "the influence of spatial boundaries is also addressed here .",
    "finally , in , we give our perspective on open problems for future studies .",
    "our goal is to describe local reactions , of either a creation or annihilation type , for which the particles rely on diffusion ( or nearest - neighbor hopping ) to be brought within reaction range .",
    "hence , these processes are often referred to as _ diffusion - limited _ reactions .",
    "some single - species examples are the pair annihilation reaction @xmath13 , where ` @xmath14 ' denotes a chemically inert compound , and coagulation @xmath6 .",
    "the diffusive particle propagation can be modeled as a continuous- or discrete - time random walk , either on a lattice or in the continuum .",
    "reactions occur when particles are within some prescribed range ; on a lattice , they can also be required to occupy the same lattice site . in such systems",
    "a single lattice site may be subject to an occupancy restriction ( to , say , at most @xmath15 particles per site ) or not , and , of course , the lattice structure can be varied ( e.g. , square or triangular in two dimensions ) .",
    "computer simulations typically employ discrete time random walks , whereas , for example , the analysis of the two - species pair annihilation reaction @xmath12 by bramson and lebowitz ( discussed in ) uses a continuous time random walk on a lattice with unlimited occupation number , but also with an infinite reaction rate so that no site simultaneously contains @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles @xcite .",
    "with such a variety of microscopic models to represent a single reaction type , it is important to determine which features are _ universal _ as opposed to those properties that depend on the specific implementation of the processes under consideration .",
    "the most general single - species reaction - diffusion system can be described by means of a set of reaction rules , the @xmath18th of which reads @xmath19 , with non - negative integers @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and where each process occurs with its own rate or probability per time step .",
    "notice that this includes the possibility of reversible reactions , for example @xmath22 as represented by @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "similarly , directed percolation , which defines a broad universality class of nonequilibrium phase transitions between active and absorbing states , can be described by the reactions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where the critical point is reached through tuning the rates of the @xmath27 reactions ( see ) .",
    "more generic in chemical systems are two - species processes , for example @xmath12 , which requires particles of _ different _ types to meet in order for the reaction to occur .",
    "the different particle species may or may not have the same diffusion constant . a general multi - species reaction may be written as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 labels the @xmath30th species , and the most general reaction model is then a set of such multi - species processes .    with such generality available , it is possible to construct both driven and relaxational systems .",
    "the former case , which includes directed percolation , typically comprises both reactions that increase and decrease the particle number . depending on appropriate combinations of the corresponding reaction rates , the ensuing competition can , in the thermodynamic limit and at long times , either result in an ` active ' state , characterized by a finite steady - state density of particles , or a situation that evolves towards the empty lattice . for reactions that require",
    "at least the presence of a single particle , the latter case constitutes an ` inactive ' or ` absorbing ' state with vanishing fluctuations from which the system can never escape .",
    "the continuous transition from an active to an absorbing state is analogous to a second - order equilibrium phase transition , and similarly requires tuning of appropriate reaction rates as control parameters to reach the critical region . as in equilibrium ,",
    "universality of the critical power laws emerges as a consequence of the diverging correlation length @xmath31 , which induces scale invariance and independence in the critical regime of microsopic parameters .",
    "alternatively , relaxational cases , such as the single - species pair annihilation reaction @xmath13 , are ultimately decaying to an absorbing state : the empty lattice ( or a single left - over particle ) . however , here it is the asymptotic decay law that is of interest , and the scaling behavior of the correlation functions in the universal regime that is often reached at large values of the time variable @xmath32 .",
    "reaction - diffusion models provide a rather intuitively accessible explanation for the origin of universality .",
    "the large - distance properties of random walks are known to be universal , depending only on the diffusion constant , a macroscopic quantity .",
    "decay processes , such as @xmath13 , eventually result in the surviving particles being separated by large distances , so at late times the probability of a pair of particles diffusing to close proximity takes on a universal form . for spatial dimension @xmath33",
    "random walks are re - entrant , which enables a pair of particles to find each other with probability one , even if they are represented by points in a continuum .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently long times the _ effective _ reaction rate will be governed by the limiting , universal probability of the pair diffusing from a large to essentially a zero relative separation . as it turns out , this asymptotically universal reaction rate is sufficient to fully determine the entire form of the leading density decay power law , that is , both its _ exponent _ and the _ amplitude _ become universal quantities .",
    "the situation is different in dimensions @xmath34 : the probability for the pair of particles to come near each other still has a universal form , but even in close proximity the reactants actually meet with probability zero if they are described as point particles in a continuum . for any reaction to occur",
    ", the particles must be given a finite size ( or equivalently , a finite reaction range ) , or be put on a lattice . since the ensuing finite effective reaction rate then clearly depends on the existence and on the microscopic details of a short - distance ( ultraviolet ) regulator , universality is ( at least partially ) lost .",
    "consequently , for any two - particle reaction , such as @xmath35 or @xmath12 , we infer the upper critical dimension to be @xmath36 .",
    "there is some confusion on this point in the literature for the two - species process @xmath12 , for which sometimes @xmath37 is claimed to be the upper critical dimension .",
    "this is based on the observation that for equal initial @xmath16 and @xmath17 particle densities the asymptotic density power - law decay becomes @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "however , this behavior is in fact fully exhibited within the framework of the _ mean - field _",
    "rate equations , see below .",
    "thus @xmath37 does not constitute an upper critical dimension in the usual sense ( namely , that for @xmath42 fluctuations are crucial and are not adequately captured through mean - field approximations ) .",
    "yet surprisingly , in the two - species pair annihilation process there occurs no marked qualitative change at two dimensions for the case of equal initial densities .",
    "however , the critical dimension @xmath36 strongly impacts the scenario with unequal initial densities , where the minority species decays exponentially with a presumably nonuniversal rate for all @xmath34 , exhibits logarithmic corrections in @xmath36 , and decays according to a stretched exponential law @xcite with universal exponent and probably also coefficient @xcite for @xmath43 ( see )",
    ". the critical dimension is similarly revealed in the scaling of the reaction zones , which develop when the @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles are initially segregated ( ) .",
    "the upper critical dimension is not always two in diffusion - limited processes . for three - particle reactions , such as @xmath44 ,",
    "the upper critical dimension becomes @xmath45 , via the same mechanism as described above : for three point particles to meet in a continuous space , they must be constrained to one dimension . for a @xmath46th order decay reaction @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 ) , the upper critical dimension is generally found to be @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "consequently , mean - field descriptions should suffice in any physical dimension @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "however , this simple argument is not necessarily valid once competing particle production processes are present as well .",
    "for example , for the universality class of directed percolation that describes generic phase transitions from active to absorbing states , the upper critical dimension is shifted to @xmath50 , as a result of combining particle annihilation and branching processes ( see ) . as mentioned before , universal features near the transition emerge as a consequence of a diverging correlation length , just as for equilibrium critical points .",
    "lattice occupation restrictions typically do not affect universality classes for relaxational reactions , since the asymptotically low densities essentially satisfy any occupation restrictions .",
    "a few exceptions are noteworthy :    \\(i ) the asymptotic decay law in the @xmath12 reaction with equal @xmath16 and @xmath17 densities and in @xmath51 dimensions depends on the fluctuations in the initial conditions , which in turn are expected to be sensitive to lattice occupation restrictions @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) in systems with purely second- or higher - order reactions , site occupation restrictions crucially affect the properties of the active phase and the phase transition that separates it from the absorbing state @xcite , see .",
    "\\(iii ) one - dimensional multi - species systems can be constructed in which the spatial ordering of the reaction products specified by the model , which can not subsequently be changed by the dynamics , does affect the asymptotic properties @xcite .      in general , kinetic rate equations are obtained by taking the rate of change of a given species density or concentration to be proportional to the appropriate product of the reactant densities and the reaction rate .",
    "this effectively constitutes a factorization of higher - order correlation functions ( the joint probability of finding a given number of reactants at the same location at a given time ) , and hence corresponds to a mean - field type approximation .",
    "for example , in the process @xmath52 the probability of a reaction is assumed to be proportional to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the overall ( mean ) @xmath16 particle density at time @xmath32 . such a description that entirely neglects correlations and spatial variations is in general justified only if the reactants remain uncorrelated and homogeneously distributed ( and well - mixed for different participating species ) throughout the system s temporal evolution .",
    "the corresponding rate equation then reads @xmath55 where @xmath56 represents a reaction rate constant , and the loss rate is proportional to @xmath57 , the number of particles removed by the reaction .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 , so @xmath58 is negative .",
    "notice that in contrast to @xmath46 , the integer variable @xmath59 does not enter the functional form of the rate equation . with an initial density @xmath60 , eq .",
    "is solved by @xmath61^{1/(k-1 ) } } ~ , \\ ] ] which for @xmath62 leads to the asymptotic decay @xmath63 , independent of the initial density @xmath60 .",
    "next consider an inhomogeneous system with a _",
    "density @xmath64 that is assumed to be slowly varying on the scale of the capture radius or lattice size .",
    "the rate equation approximation for uncorrelated reactants can still be applied ; however , the local density may now evolve not just via the reactions but also through diffusive particle motion . since the latter process is simply linear in the density",
    ", we directly add a diffusion term to the rate equation , @xmath65    for two - species reactions a pair of rate equations is required .",
    "for example , the pair annihilation process @xmath12 is represented through @xmath66 for the local particle densities @xmath64 and @xmath67 .",
    "if both densities may be taken to be uniform throughout the temporal evolution , then their decay is just described by @xmath68 , as in eq .   with @xmath69 . however , this assumption is not always justified @xcite .",
    "notice that the difference in @xmath16 and @xmath17 particle numbers is locally conserved by the annihilation reaction .",
    "correspondingly , in the case of equal diffusion constants ( @xmath70 ) , the difference field @xmath71 satisfies the diffusion equation . thus spatial inhomogeneities relax rather slowly . for the case of _ equal _ initial @xmath16 and @xmath17 densities @xmath72 , toussaint and wilczek ( tw ) observed that the fluctuations in the initial density of this diffusive field in fact determine the long - time characteristics of the two - species annihilation process @xcite . with the additional assumption of asymptotic particle segregation into separated @xmath16 and @xmath17 rich domains , which makes the spatially averaged @xmath73 and @xmath74 densities exactly half of the @xmath75 average , tw obtained the long - time behavior @xmath76 this decay is considerably slower than the one predicted by the uniform rate equation , and thus dominates for @xmath77 , provided @xmath39 .",
    "again we emphasize that the ensuing qualitative changes in four dimensions merely reflect the importance of spatial inhomogeneities within the mean - field rate equation .",
    "the rate equations of the previous section still play an important role in the field - theoretic analysis that aims to systematically include spatial flucuations and correlations .",
    "in particular , the rate equation solution represents the zeroth - order term in a loop expansion for the density , also called the tree diagram sum .",
    "above the upper critical dimension , the higher - order terms in the loop expansion only serve to modify the rate constant in some nonuniversal way .",
    "thus it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the rate equations are asymptotically valid _ without _ approximation when @xmath34 . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the higher - order terms in a loop expansion provide divergent corrections , which then must be regulated ( for example , by introducing a lattice ) and rg methods brought to bear to extract a systematic @xmath78 expansion . in this case",
    ", it is found that the rate equation solution gives rise , under rg flow , to the leading - order term in the @xmath78 expansion . as we shall see in subsequent sections , the structure of a loop expansion correcting the rate equation solution holds even for more complicated situations , such as the reaction zones in the two - species process @xmath12 with initially segregated @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles , first analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the @xmath12 pair annihilation process ,",
    "bramson and lebowitz demonstrated rigorously that the tw decay exponent is exact for all @xmath39 for a particular two - species model , finding bounds on the density amplitude @xcite .",
    "rg methods , as mentioned above , showed that the rate equations are asymptotically correct for @xmath34 , and therefore established that the tw result for the density decay , including its amplitude , was quantitatively correct and universal for @xmath79 .",
    "however , while the rg methods suggest that the tw result might extend to @xmath33 , a demonstration that this is indeed the case has not yet , in our opinion , been successfully accomplished ( see for details ) . in this case",
    ", it is rather the exact bramson - lebowitz result that lends credence to the conjecture that the tw decay exponent applies for all dimensions @xmath39 .",
    "exact solutions with explicit amplitudes are available for some reaction - diffusion models , usually in @xmath80 . for example , by exploiting a duality with the voter model , bramson and griffeath solved a particular version of the @xmath13 model in one and two dimensions @xcite , with the result @xmath81 the rg calculation for @xmath13 generalizes these results for the decay exponent to arbitrary dimensions ( albeit of limited use for @xmath33 ) @xcite and provides a quantitative expression for the decay amplitude as an expansion in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this expansion is poorly convergent in one dimension ( @xmath82 ) , but , importantly , the rg analysis does demonstrate that the density amplitude is universal .",
    "thus , the exact solution and the rg analysis contribute in a complementary manner to a full understanding of the problem , and tell us that any variation of this model , such as allowing reactions to occur whenever reactants are within some fixed number of lattice spacings , will result asymptotically in precisely the density decay law ( [ eq : bramson ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the rg expression for the amplitude in @xmath83 ( so @xmath84 ) is explicit , and matches the exact solution ( [ eq : bramson ] ) .",
    "this serves both to demonstrate universality of the result and to provide a check on the rg method .",
    "there are many other exact results available in one dimension , and it is beyond the scope of this review to provide a complete survey of this field .",
    "we restrict ourselves to mentioning a few important classes .",
    "many exact techniques exploit a mapping from the microscopic master equation onto a quantum spin chain @xcite . in several important cases ,",
    "the ensuing spin system turns out to be integrable and a variety of powerful techniques can be brought to bear , such as mapping to free - fermion systems @xcite .",
    "these quantum systems may also be studied by real space rg methods @xcite .",
    "the connection between the @xmath85 reaction and the one - dimensional glauber dynamic ising model has also been usefully exploited @xcite . for steady - state situations ,",
    "the asymmetric exclusion process , which has various reaction - diffusion generalizations , can be solved via a bethe ansatz or suitable matrix ansatz ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another useful technique is the empty interval method @xcite , which has recently been generalized to a wide range of problems @xcite .",
    "techniques for dimensions @xmath86 have also been developed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we remark that these mappings generally require that each lattice site has finite occupancy ( usually zero or one ) .",
    "although such restrictions may originate from physical considerations ( e.g. , modeling fast on - site reactions ) they do limit the investigation of universality .",
    "furthermore , very little is currently known using spin chain mappings about the dynamics of multi - species reactions .    besides exact solutions , another important method is smoluchowski theory @xcite , which constitutes a type of improved rate equation approximation .",
    "whereas rate equations represent a one - point mean - field theory , i.e. , a closed equation for the particle density , smoluchowski theory may be viewed as a two - point mean - field approximation , namely a closed set of equations for the density as well as the pair correlation function .",
    "one test particle is taken to be fixed at the origin , and the remaining reactants are effectively treated as a non - interacting diffusion field , with the boundary condition that their density vanishes at the capture radius of our original particle , and tends to some fixed value at infinity . the resulting diffusion flux toward the fixed particle is subsequently used to define an effective reaction rate , dependent on the density at infinity .",
    "the reactive processes are now approximately incorporated by assuming that the densities evolve via the usual rate equation but with the new ( time - dependent for @xmath87 ) effective rate constants .",
    "this approximation works surprisingly well , in that it actually predicts the correct decay exponents for the @xmath13 reaction , and even captures the logarithmic correction at @xmath36 .",
    "the amplitudes , however , are incorrect for @xmath42 , but yield reasonable numerical values @xcite , and are accurate for @xmath88 @xcite . remarkably therefore , this improved mean - field theory yields correct scaling exponents even below the upper critical dimension . as we shall see in , this",
    "can be traced to the fact that in the corresponding field theory there appears no propagator renormalization , and hence no anomalous dimension for the diffusion constant or the fields ( see also ref .",
    "consequently the density decay exponent turns out to be sufficiently constrained ( essentially through dimensional analysis ) that it is determined exactly , i.e. , to all orders of the @xmath78 expansion , within the rg . yet",
    "the density amplitude requires an explicit perturbative calculation via the loop ( and thus @xmath78 ) expansion . a reasonable approximation such as the smoluchowski theory incorporates the correct dimensional analysis that fully determines the decay exponent , but fails quantitatively for the amplitude calculation ( except at the marginal dimension ) .",
    "furthermore , mixed reactions , such as those considered in , may display decay exponents that are not simply fixed by dimensional analysis but rather rely on the details of the particle correlations . in these cases ,",
    "smoluchowski theory is also insufficient to obtain the correct exponents , although here the smoluchowski exponents have been shown to be the same as those from the rg improved tree level @xcite .",
    "however , unlike with field - theoretic methods , there is no obvious systematic way to improve on smoluchowski s self - consistent approach , with the goal to include higher - order correlations .",
    "we illustrate the mapping to a field theory representation first for the @xmath13 single - species pair annihilation reaction , and then generalize to other cases .",
    "we will consider particles on a lattice ( say a hypercubic lattice with lattice constant @xmath89 ) performing a continuous time random walk , where they hop to a neighboring site at some uniform rate @xmath90 ( such that @xmath91 becomes the usual diffusion constant in the continuum limit ) .",
    "the particles do not interact , except whenever two or more particles occupy the same site , in which case they annihilate with fixed reaction rate @xmath56 .",
    "the state of the system is then characterized by the probability @xmath92 at time @xmath32 of a particular configuration uniquely specified by the string of site occupation numbers @xmath93 .",
    "the system s stochastic dynamics is captured through a master equation for the time - dependent configuration probability @xmath94 . for pure diffusion",
    ", it assumes the form @xmath95 ~ , \\label{eq : meq_diffusion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summation extends over pairs of nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the first term in the square bracket represents a particle hopping from site @xmath18 to @xmath30 , and includes both probability flowing into and out of the configuration with site occupation numbers @xmath96 as a consequence of the particle move .",
    "the second term corresponds to a hop from site @xmath30 to @xmath18 .",
    "the multiplicative factors of @xmath97 and @xmath98 are a result of the particles acting independently .",
    "combining diffusion with the annihilation reaction gives @xmath99 ~ ,   \\label{eq : mastereq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath100 denotes the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "all that remains is to specify the initial probability @xmath101 . for uniform ,",
    "random initial conditions the particle distribution will be a poissonian on each site @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath102 where @xmath103 denotes the average number of particles per site .      stochastic classical particle models with local reactions can be rewritten in terms of ladder operators familiar from quantum mechanics , as shown by doi @xcite , thus taking advantage of the algebraic structure of second quantization .",
    "this representation exploits the fact that all processes just change the site occupation numbers by an integer .",
    "since we have not implemented any site occupation restrictions , we introduce for each lattice site @xmath104 creation and annihilation operators subject to ` bosonic ' commutation relations @xmath105",
    "= \\delta_{ij } ~ , \\qquad       [ \\hat a_i,\\hat a_j ] = [ \\hat a^\\dagger_i,\\hat a^\\dagger_j ] = 0 ~ .\\ ] ] the ` vacuum ' ( empty lattice ) @xmath106 is characterized by @xmath107 for all @xmath18 , and on each site @xmath18 we define the state vector @xmath108 ( note that the normalization differs from the standard quantum - mechanical convention ) .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that @xmath109    next we employ these on - site vectors to incorporate the state of the entire stochastic particle system at time @xmath32 in the quantity @xmath110 as a result , the first - order temporal evolution of the master equation is cast into an ` imaginary - time schrdinger equation ' @xmath111 where the non - hermitian time evolution operator ( ` quasi - hamiltonian ' ) for the processes in eq .   becomes @xmath112 \\hat a_i^2 ~ .\\ ] ] is formally solved by @xmath113 , with the initial state determined by eqs .   and .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath92 and its moments in this representation are of course identical to those following directly from the master equation . yet at this point we may see the advantage of using doi s formalism : the original master equation was complicated by factors of @xmath97 and @xmath114 which are now absent .",
    "the ` second - quantized ' formalism provides a natural framework for describing independent particles that may be changing in number .",
    "a different approach is to write down an appropriate fokker ",
    "planck equation @xcite for the processes under consideration , although this is somewhat awkward due to the presence of reaction processes where particles are created and / or destroyed . however , a more fundamental problem in this approach is encountered in situations with low densities . in such cases the kramers  moyal expansion used in the derivation of the fokker ",
    "planck equation break down , and it is certainly not valid to terminate the expansion in the usual way after the second term @xcite . alternatively , if the fokker ",
    "planck equation is derived from a coarse - grained langevin equation , its validity may again be questionable , since both the relevant slow variables and their stochastic noise correlations must often be inferred phenomenologically .",
    "we also note that an alternative formalism exists which again starts from a classical master equation and leads to a path integral representation .",
    "this method uses the poisson representation , and assumes that the state of the system at time @xmath32 can be expanded into a superposition of multivariate uncorrelated poissonians @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this approach is actually equivalent to doi s formalism , as presented here .",
    "an analogous representation in terms of pauli spin matrices may also be used , which then replace the bosonic ladder operators considered here .",

    "the details of the reaction are coded into the master equation , though after some practice , it is actually easier to directly start with the doi time evolution operator , as it is a more efficient representation .",
    "the general result is as follows : for a given reaction , two terms appear in the quasi - hamiltonian ( as in the original master equation ) .",
    "the first contribution , which is positive , contains both an annihilation and creation operator for each reactant , normal - ordered . for example , for the @xmath13 and @xmath6 reactions this term reads @xmath250 , whereas one obtains for the @xmath12 reaction @xmath251 .",
    "these contributions indicate that the respective second - order processes contain the particle density products @xmath252 and @xmath253 in the corresponding classical rate equations .",
    "the second term in the quasi - hamiltonian , which is negative , entails an annihilation operator for every reactant and a creation operator for every product , normal - ordered .",
    "for example , in @xmath13 this term would be @xmath254 , whereas for @xmath6 it becomes @xmath255 , and for @xmath256 it would read @xmath257 .",

    "it is not surprising that the noise term vanishes as the field @xmath266 , since the shot noise should diminish as the number of particles decreases .",
    "once the absorbing state with zero particles is reached , all deterministic as well as stochastic kinetics ceases .",
    "however , the appearance of the imaginary noise appears rather strange , and even when the stochastic force is redefined as @xmath267 , its variance becomes formally negative : @xmath268 .",
    "recall , however , that the field @xmath142 is complex , and therefore can not be simply interpreted as the particle density .",

    "however , the truncation of this expansion at second order is not justifiable , and , furthermore , a consistent description of the annihilation kinetics in terms of the fields @xmath276 and @xmath275 comes with the price of having to incorporate ` diffusion noise ' , i.e. the nonlinear coupling @xmath277 .    at any rate , this analysis and the previous discussions show that simply writing down a mean - field rate equation for the annihilation reaction and then adding _ real _ gaussian noise does not in general yield an appropriate spde .",
    "an even more significant observation is that only two - particle reactions can straightforwardly be cast in the form of an spde , since the linearization requires that the field @xmath278 appears quadratically .",
    "for example , the triplet annihilation reaction @xmath279 reaction can not simply be represented as the corresponding rate equation plus real , multiplicative noise .",
    "in this section , we describe the basic methodology for performing perturbative rg calculations in the context of reaction - diffusion field theories .",
    "while our aim is to present these techniques in a pedagogical manner , our discussion can not be entirely self - contained here . for additional details , specifically with respect to perturbation theory and its representation in terms of feynman diagrams",

    "these gaussian averages decompose into products of pair correlation functions , and can be represented symbolically through feynman diagrams .",

    "a similar cancellation of factorials happens for the vertices ; for example , a term of order @xmath305 does have the @xmath303 cancelled by the number of permutations of the @xmath298 @xmath306 vertices in the diagram .",
    "notice , however , these combinatorial factors are distinct from those that arise from the different possibilities to attach propagators .    since the systems of interest are frequently translationally invariant ( in space and time ) , the mathematical expressions represented by the feynman graphs are often most conveniently evaluated in fourier space .",
    "to calculate , say , the mean particle density @xmath307 according to eq .  , one needs diagrams with a single @xmath142 field at time @xmath32 which terminates the graph on the left .",

    "the fluctuation contributions will then explicitly depend on this cutoff scale .",
    "thus , in dimensions @xmath322 , perturbation theory is applicable in the asymptotic limit ; this implies that the overall scaling behavior of the parameters of the theory can not be affected by the analytic loop corrections , which can merely modify amplitudes .",
    "in contrast , the physically relevant ` infrared ' divergences ( in the long - time , long - distance limit ) in low dimensions @xmath33 are more serious and render a ` naive ' perturbation series meaningless . however , as will be explained in the following subsections , via exploiting scale invariance and the exact structure of the renormalization group , one may nevertheless extract fluctuation - corrected power laws by means of the perturbation expansion",

    "these tree diagrams are formed with only @xmath306 and @xmath72 vertices , and we denote the sum of all those tree contributions by @xmath323 .",
    "for example , for the @xmath35 pair reactions , we may construct this entire series iteratively to all orders as shown graphically in .",
    "thus we arrive at a self - consistent dyson equation for the particle density . more generally , for the single - species reactions @xmath0 with @xmath1 the vertex on the right - hand side is connected to @xmath46 full tree density lines .",
    "since all propagators in tree diagrams come with @xmath309 , the corresponding analytical expression for the dyson equation reads @xmath324 upon taking a time derivative , this reduces to the mean - field rate equation , with the correct initial condition .",
    "furthermore , @xmath325 , i.e. , the rate constant is properly proportional to the number of particles removed by the reaction . evidently , therefore , the tree - level approximation is equivalent to simple mean - field theory , and any fluctuation corrections to the rate equation must emerge from feynman graphs that incorporate higher - order vertices @xmath299 with @xmath326 , i.e. , diagrams with loops .",
    "we note that the mean - field rate equations also follow from the stationarity conditions , i.e. , the ` classical field equations ' , for the action @xmath190 ( regardless of performing any field shifts ) .",
    "for example , taking @xmath327 for the action results in @xmath328 and @xmath329 .    following up on our earlier discussion",
    ", we realize that the loop fluctuation contributions can not alter the asymptotic power laws that follow from the tree diagrams in sufficiently large dimensions @xmath330 , where mean - field theory should therefore yield accurate scaling exponents .",
    "however , note that , for @xmath330 , there will generally be non - negligible and non - universal ( depending on the ultraviolet cutoff ) fluctuation corrections to the amplitudes .",
    "recall that the ( upper ) critical dimension @xmath3 can be readily determined as the dimension where the effective coupling associated with loop integrals becomes dimensionless .      as we have seen in the above example , when one naively tries to extend the diagrammatic expansion beyond the tree contributions to include the corrections due to loop diagrams , one encounters divergent integrals .",
    "we are specifically interested in the situation at low dimensions @xmath331 : here the _ infrared _ ( ir ) singularities ( apparent as divergences as external wavevectors @xmath332 and either @xmath77 or @xmath333 ) emerging in the loop expansion indicate substantial deviations from the mean - field predictions .",
    "our goal is to extract the correct asymptotic power laws associated with these ` physical ' infrared singularities in the particle density and other correlation functions . to this end",
    ", we shall turn to our advantage the fact that power laws reflect an underlying _ scale invariance _ in the system .",
    "once we have found a reliable method to determine the behavior of any correlation function under either length , momentum , or time scale transformations , we can readily exploit this to construct appropriate scaling laws .",
    "there exist well - developed tools for the investigation and subsequent renormalization of _ ultraviolet _ ( uv ) singularities , which stem from the large wavenumber contribution to the loop integrals . in our models , these divergences are superficial , since we can always reinstate short - distance cutoffs corresponding to microscopic lattice spacings .",
    "however , any such _ regularization _ procedure introduces an explicit dependence on the associated regularization scale . since it does not employ any uv cutoff ,",
    "dimensional regularization is especially useful in higher - loop calculations . yet",
    "even then , in order to avoid the ir singularities , one must evaluate the integrals at some finite momentum , frequency , or time scale . in the following",

    "the preceding procedure is usually only quantitatively tractable at the lowest dimension that gives uv singularities , i.e. , the upper critical dimension @xmath3 , which is also the highest dimension where ir divergences appear . in order to obtain the infrared scaling behavior in lower dimensions",
    "@xmath42 , we must at least initially resort to a perturbational treatment with respect to the marginal couplings in the theory , which are dimensionless at @xmath3 ( and perhaps subsequently resum the perturbation series ) .",

    "we can follow standard procedures ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) for implementing the renormalization program .",
    "first , we must identify the primitive uv divergences , the sub - components of the diagrams that are responsible for these singularities .",
    "this is most conveniently done using the vertex functions @xmath338 , which represent a sum of all possible one - particle irreducible feynman graphs that are attached to @xmath97 incoming and @xmath298 outgoing propagator lines ( of course , for a multispecies vertex function , separate indices are required for the incoming and outgoing lines of each species ) . in frequency and wavevector",
    "space these subdiagrams enter multiplicatively , which means that once the vertex function divergences are resolved , the general diagrammatic expansion will be well - behaved .",

    "we refer to the standard field theory texts for a general discussion of the ensuing vertex function dimensional analysis , but provide a brief outline of the procedure for our situation .",
    "the action @xmath190 itself must be dimensionless , so any term in the integrand of @xmath190 must have scaling dimension @xmath343 . consider the @xmath0 annihilation reaction with @xmath344 .",

    "the ir singularities , on the other hand , become successively worse in higher orders of the perturbation expansion for @xmath42 . at the critical dimension ,",

    "the absence of field and diffusion constant renormalization in this case constitutes the fundamental reason that improved mean - field theories of the smoluchowski type , and also simple scaling approaches , are capable of obtaining correct density decay exponents .",
    "hence , for pair annihilation or coagulation , one would predict that the density of surviving particles at time @xmath32 is given in terms of the diffusion length by @xmath368 .     for the @xmath294 reaction , @xmath369.,width=312 ]",

    "for the simple annihilation models , the @xmath401 function is exactly quadratic in @xmath373 , which is not typical and is due to the geometric sum in the primitively divergent vertex function , which reduces the fluctuation contributions effectively to the one - loop graph .",

    "this conservation law provides a slow mode in the dynamics that is crucial in determining the long - time behavior of the system .",
    "we consider first the case where the @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles are initially mixed together throughout the system .",
    "if their initial densities are unequal , say @xmath499 , the asymptotic dynamics will approach a steady concentration of @xmath500 of @xmath17 particles , with very few isolated @xmath16 particles suriving .",
    "in this situation , exact results indicate an exponentially decaying @xmath16 particle density for @xmath34 , logarithmic corrections to an exponential in @xmath83 , and a stretched exponential @xmath501 form for @xmath495 @xcite , where @xmath502 is a constant . as briefly discussed in above",
    ", these results correspond in the rg framework to the standard renormalization of the reaction rate .",
    "in contrast , when starting from equal initial densities , the fluctuations in the initial conditions for the difference field @xmath498 decay to zero slowly , by diffusion . this case",
    "was studied by toussaint and wilczek @xcite based on the idea that after a time @xmath32 , on length scales shorter than the diffusion length @xmath503 only whichever of the species happened to be in the majority in that region initially will remain . in other words , the two species asymptotically segregate .",
    "since the initial difference between the @xmath16 and @xmath17 particle numbers in that region is proportional to @xmath504 , this leads to an asymptotic @xmath505 decay @xcite .",
    "clearly , for @xmath39 , this dominates the faster @xmath40 mean - field density decay which assumes well - mixed reactants throughout the system s temporal evolution .",
    "toussaint and wilczek explicitly calculated the amplitude for this decay under the assumption that the only relevant fluctuations are those in the initial conditions .",
    "these results were since confirmed by exact methods @xcite .    turning to the field - theoretic rg approach , the action for the process @xmath407 contains diffusive propagators for both @xmath16 and @xmath17 species , possibly with unequal diffusion constants , together with the interaction vertices @xmath506 , @xmath507 and @xmath508 .",

    "remarkably , comparisons with exact results for the decay exponent in one dimension @xcite show that this qualitative change in the system does not lead to any modification in the form of the asymptotic density decay exponent at @xmath83 ( and so very unlike the case of _ unequal _ initial denities ) .",
    "however , actually demonstrating this using field theory methods has not yet been accomplished , since this would involve a very difficult non - perturbative sum over the initial ` surface ' terms .",
    "lastly , we also mention related work by sasamoto and coworkers @xcite where the @xmath512 reaction was studied using field - theoretic techniques , by methods similar to those of ref .  @xcite .",

    "later , as the particles have an opportunity to diffuse into the interface , a reaction zone forms .",
    "glfi and racz first studied these reaction zones within the local mean - field equations , and were able to extract some rich scaling behavior : the width of the reaction region grows as @xmath515 , the width of the depletion region grows , as might be expected , as @xmath482 , and the particle densities in the reaction zone scale as @xmath516 @xcite .",

    "the above initially segregated system may be directly related to this steady - state case by observing that , in the former , the depletion region is asymptotically much larger than the reaction zone itself .",

    "cornell and droz @xcite extended the analysis of the steady - state problem beyond the mean field equations and , with rg motivated arguments , conjectured a reaction zone width @xmath522 for the case @xmath43 .",
    "lee and cardy confirmed this result using rg methods @xcite .",
    "the essential physics here is that the only dimensional parameters entering the problem are the reaction rate and the current @xmath462 .",

    "dimensional analysis fixes the above scaling form ( with logarithmic corrections in @xmath475 @xcite ) .",
    "howard and cardy @xcite provided explicit calculations for the scaling functions . however , numerical investigations of the exponent of the reaction zone width revealed a surprisingly slow convergence to its predicted value @xmath523 in @xmath495 @xcite .",

    "there it was shown that this noise - induced wandering dominates over the intrinsic front width and generates a multiplicative logarithmic correction to the basic @xmath523 scaling in @xmath495 .",
    "remarkably , one can also study the reaction zones in the initially mixed system with equal initial densities , since it asymptotically segregates for @xmath51 and spontaneously forms reaction zones . as shown by lee and cardy @xcite , if one assumes that in the depletion regions , where only diffusion occurs , the density goes from the bulk value @xmath505 to zero in a distance of order @xmath482 , the current scales as @xmath524 .",
    "from this the scaling of the reaction zone width with time immediately follows . as @xmath525 from below",

    "a simple generalization of the qualitative arguments of toussaint and wilczek shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "the presence of the shear flow means that in volumes smaller than @xmath530^{1/2}$ ] only the species which was initially in the majority of that region will remain .",
    "hence , we immediately identify a crossover time @xmath531 .",
    "for @xmath532 the shear flow is unimportant and the usual @xmath505 density decay is preserved .",
    "however for @xmath533 , we find a @xmath534 decay holding in @xmath43 . since @xmath83 is clearly the lowest possible dimension for such a shear flow , we see that the shear has essentially eliminated the non - classical kinetics . these arguments can be put on a more concrete basis by a field - theoretic rg analysis @xcite , which shows the shear flow adds terms of the form @xmath535 and @xmath536 to the action .",
    "the effect of these contributions can then be incorporated into modified propagators , after which the analysis proceeds similarly to the homogeneous case @xcite .",
    "the related , but somewhat more complex example of @xmath537 in a quenched random velocity field was considered by oerding @xcite . in this case",

    "however , to proceed beyond this result , oerding applied rg methods to confirm the decay exponent and also to compute the amplitude of the density decay to first order in @xmath545 @xcite .",
    "the analysis proceeds along the same lines as the homogeneous case @xcite , particularly in the derivation of effective ` initial ' interaction terms , although care must also be taken to incorporate the effects of the random velocity field , which include a renormalization of the diffusion constant .",
    "lastly , we mention work by deem and park , who analyzed the properties of the @xmath12 reaction using rg methods in the case of long - ranged potential disorder @xcite , and in a model of turbulent flow @xcite .",

    "the exponent follows directly from the conservation laws and is universal , whereas the amplitude @xmath16 turns out to be model - dependent .",

    "the renormalization of the theory proceeds again similar to the case of @xmath13 : only the reaction rates need to be renormalized , and this can be performed to all orders in perturbation theory . for @xmath511 , perturbative calculations for the density decay rates",
    "were only possible in the limit where the density of one species was very much greater than that of the other .",
    "the density decay exponent of the majority species then follows the standard pure annihilation kinetics , whereas the minority species decay exponent was computed to @xmath551 @xcite .",

    "the calculation of this exponent using rg methods has been confirmed and also slightly generalized in ref .",
    "the above mixed reaction - diffusion system also provides a good testing ground in which to compare rg methods with the smoluchowski approximation , which had earlier been applied to the same multi - species reaction - diffusion system @xcite .",
    "this is a revealing comparison as the value of the minority species decay exponent is non - trivial for @xmath33 , and is no longer fixed purely by dimensional analysis ( as is the case for the pure annihilation exponent for @xmath43 ) .",
    "this difference follows from the existence of an additional dimensionless parameter in the multi - species problem , namely the ratio of diffusion constants .",

    "this result follows from the indistinguishability of the two species at large times : below the upper critical dimension , the reaction rates run to identical fixed points .",
    "since the diffusion constants are also equal there is then no way to asymptotically distinguish between the two species , whose densities must therefore decay at the same rate .",
    "the same set of reactions , with equal diffusion constants , was used to study the application of bogolyubov s theory of weakly nonideal bose gases to reaction - diffusion systems @xcite .",

    "@xcite as the kang - redner anomaly .",
    "this failure could be traced back to an anomalous dimension of the initial mass distribution , a feature which , as discussed in , can not be picked up by smoluchowski - type approximations .",

    "physically this is again due to the re - entrance property of random walks : as soon as two particles of the same species approach each other , they will rapidly annihilate regardless of the competing ` scattering ' processes , which only produce particle pairs in close proximity and therefore with a large probability of immediate subsequent annihilation .    finally , we mention the multi - species pair annihilation reactions @xmath555 with @xmath556 , first studied by ben - avraham and redner @xcite , and more recently by deloubrire and coworkers @xcite . for unequal initial densities or different reaction rates between the species , one",
    "generically expects the same scaling as for @xmath12 asymptotically ( when only the two most numerous , or least reactive , species remain ) .",
    "an interesting special case therefore emerges when all rates and initial densities coincide . for any @xmath557 and in dimensions @xmath321 it was argued that particle species segregation can not occur , and hence that the asymptotic density decay rate for equal initial densities and annihilation rates should be the same as for the single - species reaction @xmath13 . in one dimension , however , particle segregation does take place for all @xmath558 , and leads to a @xmath559-dependent power law @xmath560 for the total density @xcite . for @xmath561 , this recovers the two - species decay @xmath562 , whereas the single - species behavior @xmath563 ensues in the limit @xmath564 ( since the probability that a given particle belongs to a given species vanishes in this limit , any species distinction indeed becomes meaningless ) .",

    "persistence , in its simplest form , refers to the probability that a particular event has never occurred in the entire history of an evolving statistical system @xcite .",
    "persistence probabilities are often universal and have been found to be nontrivial even in otherwise well - understood systems .",
    "an intensively studied example concerns the zero - temperature relaxational dynamics of the ising model , where one is interested in the persistence probability that , starting from random initial conditions , a given site has never been visited by a domain wall . in one dimension , the motion and annihilation of ising domain walls at zero temperature is equivalent to an @xmath493 reaction - diffusion system , where the domain walls in the ising system correspond to the reacting particles .",
    "an exact solution exists for the persistence probability in this case @xcite , but , as usual , the solution casts little light on the question of universality .",
    "a different approach was proposed by cardy who studied , in the framework of the reaction - diffusion model , the proportion of sites never visited by any particle @xcite . in @xmath495 ( though not in higher dimensions ) this is the same quantity as the original persistence probability .",
    "furthermore , since cardy was able to employ the kind of field - theoretic rg methods discussed in this review , the issue of universality could be addressed as well .",

    "was given by howard @xcite in the mixed two - species reaction @xmath13 , @xmath12 , with immobile @xmath17 particles ( see also ) .",
    "in this case the persistence probability corresponds to the density decay of immobile @xmath17 particles in @xmath495 , in the limit where their density is much smaller than those of the @xmath16 particles .",
