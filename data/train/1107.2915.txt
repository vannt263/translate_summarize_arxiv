    "the pseudogap temperature is a fundamental quantity in strongly interacting fermi superfluids , such as high-@xmath1 cuprates@xcite and superfluid @xmath4k and @xmath5li fermi gases@xcite . the normal state region below this characteristic temperature",
    "is referred to as the pseudogap regime , where anomalies are seen in various physical quantities , such as a gap - like structure in single - particle density of states . as the origin of the pseudogap regime , the so - called preformed - pair scenario has been extensively discussed in high-@xmath6 cuprates@xcite . however , because of the complexity of this system , other scenarios have been also proposed , such as antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations@xcite , and a hidden order@xcite . in contrast , in cold fermi gases , because of the simplicity of the system , the origin can be uniquely identified as strong pairing fluctuations@xcite .",

    "such a double - peak structure of the lsw is absent above @xmath3 , so that the back - bending behavior in the high temperature regime is purely due to the contact interaction .",

    "we then find in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] that , although the resulting spectral peaks are broadened by the finite resolution , the overall spectral structure remain unchanged .",

    "this structure becomes more remarkable in panel ( c ) .",
    "we compare the calculated occupied density of states with the experiment results on a @xmath4k fermi gas@xcite . in the unitarity limit",

    "to summarize , we have discussed the pseudogap phenomenon and effects of a harmonic trap in the bcs - bec crossover regime of an ultracold fermi gas . extending our previous work at @xmath1 to the region above @xmath1 ,",
    "we have calculated single - particle local density of states ( ldos ) , as well as the single - particle local spectral weight ( lsw ) , within the framework of the combined @xmath0-matrix theory with the local density approximation .",
    "we clarified how the pseudogap structures in these quantities gradually disappear with increasing the temperature . from these",
    ", we introduced two pseudogap temperatures @xmath2 ( for the density of states ) and @xmath3 ( for the spectral weight ) .",
    "as in the case of a uniform fermi gas , @xmath2 does not coincide with @xmath3 . while @xmath7 is obtained in the weak - coupling bcs side , one finds @xmath160 in the strong - coupling bec side .",
    "this means that the pseudogap temperature depends on what we measure .",
    "we have also examined the photoemission spectrum in the pseudogap regime . at present",
    ", the photoemission - type experiment has no spatial resolution , so that the observed photoemission spectra are spatially averaged ones .",
    "although the spatial average smears inhomogeneous pseudogap effects to some extent , we showed that the double peak structure , which is characteristic of the pseudogap effect , still survives even when such a smearing effect is taken into account .",
    "the photoemission spectra , as well as the occupied density of states , calculated in the crossover and bec regime agree well with the recent experiments on @xmath4k fermi gases , so that the combined @xmath0-matrix theory with lda used in this paper is found to be a powerful theory to study the pseudogap physics in cold fermi gases .",
    "since the pseudogap temperature , which we have determined in this paper , is a key quantity in the pseudogap physics , the experimental determination of this characteristic temperature would be useful for the further understanding of strong - pairing fluctuations existing in the bcs - bec crossover regime of a cold fermi gases .",
