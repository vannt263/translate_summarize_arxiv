    "physics involving charmed particles is one of the main topics to be explored at the planned fair facility in darmstadt @xcite . in particular",
    ", the program proposed by the @xmath9anda collaboration encompasses a wide range of activities connected to this subject including high - accuracy spectroscopy of charmed hadrons and the investigation of their interactions with ordinary matter @xcite . presently very little",
    "is known about the interaction of charmed particles with conventional hadrons and/or nuclear matter built up predominantly from up- and down quarks .",
    "clearly , the rate at which charmed hadrons can be produced is a crucial factor for designing and performing secondary experiments with those particles . in particular , attaining a sufficient yield is a prerequisite for investigating issues like @xmath10-quarkonium dissociation  @xcite and the creation of new exotic nuclear bound states of @xmath11 and @xmath12  , charmed hypernuclei  @xcite , and charmed d - mesic nuclei   that have been discussed in the literature over the last few years .    in this work we present predictions for the charm - production reactions @xmath13 and @xmath14 close to their thresholds .",
    "the work builds on the jlich meson - baryon model for the reaction @xmath15",
    "the extension of the model from the strangeness to the charm sector follows a strategy similar to our recent work on the @xmath16 and @xmath17 interactions  @xcite , and on the reaction @xmath18",
    "@xcite , namely by imposing as a working hypothesis su(4 ) symmetry constraints and improvements from quark - gluon dynamics at short distances  .",
    "the microscopic charm - production process is described by baryon exchange ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) and the transition potentials are derived from the corresponding transitions in the strangeness - production channels ( @xmath21 ) utilizing values of the involved coupling constants that are fixed from su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "the reaction amplitudes themselves are evaluated in distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) .",
    "this is done because we want to take into account rigorously the effects of the initial ( @xmath22 ) and also of the final - state interactions which are known to play an important role for energies near the production threshold @xcite .    as before in our study of the reaction @xmath18",
    "@xcite we investigate the effect of replacing the transition interaction based on meson - baryon dynamics by a charm - production potential derived in the constituent quark model .",
    "this allows us to shed light on the model dependence of our results .",
    "furthermore , we compare our predictions with the ones of other model calculations of the @xmath23 reaction from the literature @xcite . in some of those studies a quark - gluon description based on a factorization hypothesis of hard and soft processes @xcite is employed , while in others a non - perturbative quark - gluon string model is used , based on secondary regge pole exchanges including absorptive corrections  @xcite .",
    "preliminary results ( for @xmath23 ) of our study were presented in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we discuss the @xmath24 interaction used for the initial - state interaction ( isi ) . because of the known sensitivity of the annhilation cross sections on the isi , we examine its effect by considering various @xmath24 potentials where we make sure that all of them reproduce the total @xmath22 cross section in the relevant energy range and , in general , describe also data on integrated elastic and charge - exchange cross sections and even @xmath22 differential cross sections .",
    "predictions for the reaction @xmath23 that include effects of the @xmath22 isi are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] .",
    "transition potentials based on meson - baryon dynamics and derived in the quark model are considered .    to study also the influence of the final - state interaction ( fsi ) ,",
    "we extend a @xmath25 interaction potential , developed by the jlich group in the past @xcite , by adding to this coupled - channel model the @xmath4 and the @xmath8 channels .",
    "this extension is described in detail in sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] and then the influence of the resulting fsi on the @xmath23 cross section is examined .",
    "finally , we provide predictions for the production of the charmed strange meson @xmath1 in the reaction @xmath26 . in this case",
    "a two - step process is required and , therefore , the pertinent cross section can not be calculated in approaches that rely on the born approximation in one way or the other . however , in a coupled - channel approach like ours the transition amplitude from @xmath22 to @xmath8 is generated in a natural way .",
    "the paper ends with a summary .",
    "technical aspects related to the derivation of the various interaction potentials are summarized in the appendices .",
    "for the @xmath27 interaction in the initial state , we take the same model that has been already employed in our recent study of the process @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "it is based on the interaction originally developed for our investigation of @xmath28 and consists of an elastic part which is deduced ( via g - parity transform ) from a simple , energy - independent one - boson - exchange @xmath29 potential ( obepf ) @xcite and a phenomenological annihilation part for which a spin- , isospin- , and energy - independent optical potential of gaussian form is adopted : v^|n n|n n_opt(r ) = ( u_0 + i w_0 ) e^- r^2/2r^2_0 .",
    "[ vaa - pp ]      .[cross ] total and integrated elastic @xmath22 cross sections and integrated charge - exchange ( @xmath30 ) cross sections in @xmath31 for the four potentials considered in comparison to experimental values . [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us make some more comments about the coupling constants at the three - meson vertices , specifically with regard to the imposed ideal mixing between the octet and singlet .",
    "@xmath32 symmetry implies the following for the vector meson coupling constants relevant for our study : @xmath33    assuming ideal mixing of the @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 one obtains for the coupling constants of the physical @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath11 @xmath39 the same relation holds also for the @xmath40 meson and for the @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in case of the @xmath40 meson the coupling constant @xmath43",
    "is given by that of @xmath44 alone , since there is no singlet coupling for ppv vertices as mentioned above : @xmath45 in case of the @xmath0 meson the coupling constant is given by @xmath46 and for the @xmath1 meson , @xmath47    the jlich @xmath25 potential contains also vertex form factors @xmath48 that are meant to take into account the extended hadron structure and are parametrized in the conventional monopole or dipole form @xcite . in the present extension to the @xmath4 and @xmath49 systems the cut - off masses appearing in those form factors for the various three - meson vertices are mostly taken over from ref .  @xcite . in particular , for vertices involving vector mesons without charm ( @xmath50 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath51 ) , we make the assumption that @xmath52 and/or @xmath53 , i.e. we use the same cutoff masses for the same exchange particles  a prescription that is guided by the notion that those form factors parametrize predominantly the off - mass - shell behavior of the exchanged particles . for the additional vertices that concern the exchange of a @xmath54(2009 ) or @xmath55(2112 ) or of a @xmath56(3096 ) we adopt cutoff masses that are about 1  gev larger than the mass of the exchange particle .",
    "a compilation of the cutoff masses employed at the various three - meson vertices is provided in table  [ coup ] .",
    "in our model calculation we use @xmath57 coupling constants that are determined fully by su(4 ) symmetry . in our opinion ,",
    "the difference of those values to the ones deduced from available experimental information is not very large and , thus , does not really warrant a departure from su(4 ) at present . but let us review the situation briefly here .",
    "the @xmath58 coupling constant was determined in refs .",
    "@xcite based on the vector dominance model and found to be @xmath59 .",
    "this value , which was subsequently adopted in several investigations  @xcite , is only marginally smaller than the one which follows from assuming su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath60 coupling constant , found to be @xmath61 in ref .",
    "@xcite , likewise derived within the vector dominance model . in ref .",
    "@xcite the value @xmath62 is cited , derived from the measured decay width of the @xmath54 meson . here",
    "the corresponding su(4 ) coupling constant is roughly a factor 2 smaller .",
    "deviations from the su(4 ) symmetry are also discussed in refs .  .",
