    "in this paper we report the most recent results form the cdf and d0 experiments on heavy flavor spectroscopy .",
    "we start with the measurements of production fractions of ground state @xmath4 hadrons in @xmath5 collisions in sec .",
    "[ sec : hadron - production ] .",
    "properties of the x(3872 ) are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : x ] .",
    "results on the @xmath3 mesons are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : bc ] . finally , in the last two chapters the observation and measurement of masses and widths of @xmath2 mesons is presented .",
    "the process of transformation of @xmath4 quarks produced in collisions into @xmath4 hadrons is non - perturbative .",
    "it can not be easily calculated and has to be measured experimentally . in a recent analysis @xcite , cdf measures",
    "the probability of a @xmath4 quark to end up as @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "these probabilities are denoted as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "five final states are reconstructed in @xmath15 of data : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is either an electron or a muon .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum is then fit to obtain the signal yield for each signature .",
    "two examples of such fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : b - fragmentation ] .",
    "one of the difficulties in performing an analysis such as this is the fact that the final state does not in some cases uniquely identify the parent ground state @xmath4 hadron .",
    "for example , both @xmath7 and @xmath8 can decay into the @xmath22 final state .",
    "therefore , the cross talk between the channels has to be taken into account .",
    "in this analysis it is assumed that the partial width into the semileptonic channels is equal for all ground state @xmath4 hadrons .",
    "the ratios of the @xmath23 constants are measured .",
    "the `` raw '' ratios containing the branching fractions of the component decays are found to be the following :    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    from the above , using the best available values for branching fractions , cdf obtains :    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    the ratios for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 agree well with the values from the lep experiments @xcite , however the value of the @xmath14 is currently different from the lep result by approximately @xmath30 .",
    "the discovery of a new particle @xmath1 was made by belle in 2003 @xcite .",
    "belle observed this particle in @xmath31 decays reconstructing the @xmath32 decay channel of the @xmath33 .",
    "cdf and d0 soon confirmed the discovery .",
    "the nature of the @xmath1 remained unclear and is not obvious from the mere observation of a bump in the @xmath34 mass spectrum .",
    "henceforth , the experiments capable of producing the @xmath33 , and that includes babar in addition to the three mentioned above , embarked on the program of measuring properties of the @xmath33 one by one , as the amount of reconstructed signal grew over the last years .    from tevatron ,",
    "first , came the mass measurement , then the production properties including kinematics as well as the prompt fraction have been measured which suggested similarity between the @xmath33 and @xmath35 production in @xmath5 collisions @xcite .",
    "one of the best approaches to figuring out the nature of the @xmath33 is measuring its quantum numbers .",
    "the values of @xmath36 are the target of the latest analysis from cdf @xcite .",
    "the @xmath36 is investigated by analyzing angular distributions of the decay .",
    "it turns out that the most sensitive angles to @xmath36 values are the two helicity angles @xmath37 , @xmath38 and the angle @xmath39 between the decay planes of the @xmath40 and the @xmath41 systems .",
    "these angles are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : x - angle - defs ] .    in approximately @xmath42 of data",
    "approximately 3000 of the @xmath33 particles are found . in order to reconstruct the angular distributions for the signal candidates , all reconstructed candidates",
    "are split into bins in three dimensions : three bins in @xmath39 , two bins in @xmath37 and two bins in @xmath38 giving total of 3@xmath432@xmath432@xmath4412 bins . in each of these subsamples the invariant mass spectrum of the candidates is fit , and the signal yield is measured .",
    "the result for all 12 bins is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : x_result ] .",
    "the expected shape for the distribution is derived from theory .",
    "the amplitude is factorized according to the isobar model into the three factors for that describe the @xmath33 , the @xmath45 and the @xmath41 systems as well as the two propagators for the @xmath45 and @xmath41 .",
    "the angular momentum values @xmath46 and @xmath47 are considered for the @xmath41 system .",
    "the correction to the shapes due to detector acceptance effects are applied .",
    "the shapes are derived for a variety of @xmath36 models .    for each model",
    "a @xmath48-based probability of matching the 12 data points is calculated .",
    "the list of models and corresponding probabilities are found in table  [ tab : x - table ] .",
    "the three best and the one least probable hypothesis are plotted over the data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : x_result ] .",
    "it is immediately obvious that there are two possible combinations that fit the data quite well : @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "all others are excluded at @xmath51 level .",
    "as the angular analysis at cdf can not distinguish between the two possibilities for the @xmath36 , one may consider examining the @xmath41 invariant mass distribution .",
    "the shape of this distribution is different for the @xmath46 case that corresponds to the @xmath52 and the @xmath47 case corresponding to the @xmath50 .",
    "this has been attempted by belle @xcite and the conclusion was , using a simple breit - wigner model , favoring @xmath52 .",
    "later , cdf released an analysis of the dipion mass spectrum @xcite using more sophisticated and generalized approach concluding that both @xmath46 and @xmath47 are possible . and thus , cdf results from both angular and dipion mass distributions allow either @xmath52 or @xmath50 assignments for the @xmath1 .",

    "although discovered in 198 by cdf @xcite , the properties of the @xmath3 remain poorly measured due to small samples of candidates available until recently . in run ii , cdf at d0 experiments have finally accumulated enough data to study the @xmath3 in greater detail . being",
    "the last discovered ground state @xmath31 meson and the only meson with two heavy quarks of different flavor , the @xmath3 is a great laboratory for potential models , hqet and lattice qcd .",
    "its mass , lifetime , decay properties and production are all of interest as many precise predictions have been made by theorists .    at the tevatron , the @xmath3",
    "is reconstructed in several decay channels containing a @xmath45 meson .",
    "it is seen in the semileptonic modes @xmath53 and @xmath54 by cdf , and in @xmath55 by d0 .",
    "the signal significance in all cases is over @xmath56 and the number of signal events ( 100@xmath57 ) is sufficient for a proper decay time measurement .",
    "d0 uses @xmath58 while cdf uses @xmath59 events .",
    "the measured values for the proper decay time are the following @xcite :    @xmath60    @xmath61    note , that only a fraction of available data is used by both experiments ( cdf analyzed @xmath62 and d0 @xmath63 ) , so significant improvements of the measurements are expected in near future .",
    "the measured value agrees well with the theoretical prediction of @xmath64 found in @xcite .",
    "in addition , cdf measures the @xmath3 mass with high precision @xcite analyzing a sample of fully reconstructed @xmath65 decays . in @xmath66 of data a clear peak with @xmath67 significance",
    "is seen in the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath68 candidates .",
    "a fit to this spectrum yields the mass measurement :    @xmath69    which agrees moderately well with predictions from lattice qcd @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopy of the @xmath71 system , where @xmath72 is either @xmath73 or @xmath74 quark , is well understood theoretically .",
    "the hqet describes a heavy - light state and predicts that there are four p - wave states , collectively called @xmath2 or @xmath75 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bstst - diagram ] .",
    "it is expected that two of them , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are wide states as they decay via s - wave . on the other hand ,",
    "the remaining to states are narrow because they decay via d - wave .",
    "the quantitative understanding is not nearly as good .",
    "few experimental data are available on @xmath2 properties . however , since recently we are starting to see progress in this area .",
    "both cdf and d0 seek to observe and measure the two of the @xmath2 that have a narrow width , expected to be @xmath78 from theory .",
    "the other two p - wave states , the broad ones , are ignored as they are so wide that distinguishing them from combinatorial background is nearly impossible with the available data .",
    "@xmath79 decays only to @xmath80 while @xmath81 can decay to either @xmath80 or the ground state @xmath82 .",
    "the analysis @xcite from the d0 experiment searches for all three possible decays of the narrow states mentioned above .",
    "the final state @xmath82 is reconstructed .",
    "the photon coming from @xmath83 decays is ignored , and leads to a shifted position of the mass peak for @xmath84 and @xmath85 signal events .",
    "the @xmath8 mesons are collected with dimuon trigger in the channel @xmath86 .",
    "the mass distribution of @xmath8 candidates for the full d0 sample ( 1  fb@xmath0 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bstst - jpsik - d0 ] .    the mass difference @xmath87 for the @xmath82 candidates is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bstst - dm - d0 ] .",
    "this is the first observation of separate peaks for the narrow @xmath2 states .",
    "d0 proceeds to fit this mass spectrum , assuming that the widths of the two narrow resonances are the same and fixing the mass difference between the @xmath88 and @xmath8 to 45.78  mev/@xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the fit returns the masses and the width of these states : @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92    the d0 also reports the production rates for these resonances : @xmath93    @xmath94    @xmath95    the cdf experiment performs a similar analysis .",
    "the same three decays of the @xmath79 and @xmath81 are the subject of the measurement .",
    "the cdf sample of @xmath8 contains two signatures : @xmath86 and @xmath96 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bstst - bplus - cdf ] ) where the combined yield on 374  pb@xmath0 of data is order of 4000 signal candidates .",
    "the mass difference @xmath97 for the reconstructed @xmath2 candidates is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bstst - dm - cdf ] .",
    "the fit of the mass spectrum is performed with the widths of both @xmath2 fixed to the theoretical expectation @xmath98 @xcite , and the ratio @xmath99 is assumed to be @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "the result of the fit is two mass measurements :    @xmath101 @xmath102",
    "the heavy - light system @xmath104 is similar in its behavior to the @xmath105 and @xmath106 systems . as well , the hqet predicts two narrow and two wide @xmath107 states .",
    "these are even more difficult to study because of lower production rates of @xmath9 mesons in comparison to more common @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    the d0 reports observation of a mass peak that is interpreted as @xmath103 . due to the isospin conservation the decays of @xmath107 to @xmath108",
    "are highly suppressed , thus the d0 team is looking at the @xmath109 signature . in the analysis , the same sample of @xmath86 events , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : bstst ] , is used . the invariant mass difference @xmath110 for the @xmath107 candidates",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bsstst - dm - d0 ] . a clear peak is observed with the significance over @xmath56 .",
    "the d0 asserts that the observed peak should be identified with the @xmath103 ( for longer discussion see @xcite ) and measures its mass to be @xmath111",
    "with 1  fb@xmath0 of data , many exciting results on heavy flavor physics are presently coming from the tevatron experiments . in this paper",
    "we have seen interesting results on heavy flavor spectroscopy .",
    "cdf narrows the @xmath36 of the x(3872 ) down to @xmath52 and @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath2 states are now being resolved and precisely measured .",
    "the @xmath3 properties are much more accessible than in the past .",
    "overall , it is good time for flavor physics at the tevatron as we are on the way to collecting multi - fb@xmath0 of data .",
