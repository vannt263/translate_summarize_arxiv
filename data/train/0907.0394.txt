    "a bit of information can be stored in any physical system with two distinct states . for the physical system to be a reliable memory ,",
    "the states of the system must be robust against external fluctuations .",
    "the classic example is a ferromagnet . below a critical temperature ,",
    "the size of the average magnetization is robust against changes in external magnetic field and temperature - driven spin fluctuations .",
    "a quantum bit ( qubit ) of information can be stored in any physical system with two orthogonal quantum states .",
    "a goal of quantum information is to engineer a system that can reliably store the state of the qubit in the presence of environment - induced fluctuations .",
    "a number of approaches have been proposed from quantum error - correction  @xcite to passive protection of the information through symmetries  @xcite or energetics  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of engineering the quantum equivalent of the magnetic hard drive is quite attractive .",
    "the premise is that a macroscopic number of qubits with multi - qubit interactions could create a single stable qubit memory .",
    "it is widely suspected that kitaev s toric code on a four dimensional lattice would achieve this task  @xcite . in lower - dimensions ,",
    "the answer is unclear .",
    "bravyi and terhal have recently shown that for interactions based on stabilizer codes , there is no two - dimensional self - correcting quantum memory  @xcite .",
    "they make the reasonable physical assumption that the number of qubits involved in the interactions does not grow with the size of the lattice . in the case of self - correcting memories based on concatenated codes",
    "the number of qubits involved in each interaction does grow with the lattice size  @xcite .    here",
    "we consider the classical concatenated triple - modular redundancy code in the formalism of quantum stabilizers .",
    "the standard choice of generators for this code leads to interactions that grow with the system size . choosing a different set of generators yields interactions that are only between two - bits and equivalent to an ising model . in this paper ,",
    "monte carlo simulations are used to study the critical behavior of the error - correction inspired structures shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structures ] within the framework of a ferromagnetic ising model .",
    "the calculations use the wolff algorithm  @xcite together with the histogram method  @xcite and finite - size scaling  @xcite .",
    "these high resolution monte carlo techniques have been utilized successfully to study the critical phenomena of many different model hamiltonian systems such as the 3d ising ferromagnet  @xcite , heisenberg lattice  @xcite , xy models  @xcite , dilute ising magnet  @xcite , potts models  @xcite , and sierpinski fractals of dimensions , @xmath0 , between one and two  @xcite and between two and three  @xcite .",
    "we study how the choice of generators changes the hamiltonian and affects the magnitude of the critical temperature .",
    "critical behavior is characterized by the set of critical exponents ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and wolff dynamical critical exponents are calculated for each structure .    the results presented here show that structures with low dimensionality and two - body interactions preserve one bit of information .",
    "it suggests two new directions for examining self - correcting quantum memories : 1 ) choosing non - standard stabilizer generators to minimize the multi - qubit interactions and 2 ) to examine stabilizer codes on fractional dimensional geometries .",
    "we consider the familiar classical code of triple modular redundancy . each bit , @xmath4 ,",
    "is encoded into a logical bit , @xmath5 , consisting of three bits of equal value , i.e. @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "if an error occurs on a single bit , majority vote can be used to determine the value of the logical bit ; two errors would not be corrected .",
    "one way to protect against higher errors is to concatenate the code recursively . at each level of concatenation @xmath8 ,",
    "the logical bit consists of three bits of level k-1 , e.g. a 0 at level @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 .",
    "correction works by majority vote at the lowest level first and then working up .",
    "each level of concatenation @xmath8 can always correct a maximum of @xmath11 errors on the physical bits .",
    "the basic idea of the stabilizer formalism is that a quantum state or subspace can be described by the operators that have + 1 eigenvalue on that space  @xcite .",
    "the stabilizer formalism is particularly useful for describing quantum error correcting codes .",
    "classical error correcting codes represent a subset of quantum error correcting codes that only protect against classical bit - flip errors and not the phase errors .",
    "the triple modular redundancy code is a textbook example for introducing the idea of stabilizer error correcting codes  @xcite .",
    "below we review the case of this concatenated code and show how it translates directly onto the ising model .",
    "following standard quantum computation notation , the states of the @xmath12 spin are represented as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the pauli-@xmath16 operator on the @xmath12 spin ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , and @xmath19 is the pauli-@xmath4 operator on the @xmath12 spin ( flips the @xmath12 bit ) . for level-1 encoded bits @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the encoded @xmath22 operator is defined as @xmath23 and for level 1 is @xmath24 .    for stabilizer codes ,",
    "the stabilizer is defined as all the products of pauli operators that act trivially on the code space .",
    "for the three - bit code , the stabilizer consists of four operators @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the identity .",
    "the stabilizer can also be defined by the generators of the group , @xmath27 .    in the case of level-1 triple modular redundancy ,",
    "the freedom in the minimal generators is trivial @xmath28 . equating the sum of the generators with a hamiltonian , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the coupling strength , yields the ising interaction between three spins in a line .",
    "if the full stabilizer is used , then @xmath31 , which corresponds to ising interactions between spins on a triangle with an energy offset due to the identity .",
    "in all cases , the codespace is the degenerate ground state of the hamiltonian .",
    "we are interested in the thermodynamic limit and whether the energy gap between the ground state and the transition state will preserve the information .",
    "our goal is to study how the choice of generators affects the critical temperature of the ferromagnetic phase transition . at higher levels",
    "the choice of generators is non - trivial . as an example , consider k=2 .",
    "the standard choice of generators is @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 .",
    "notice the six bit operators can be written as products of @xmath40 operators , @xmath41 . if the generators are used to define a hamiltonian , then increasing @xmath8 leads to many - body operators that act on @xmath42 spins at once .",
    "this exponential increase in the many - body nature of the hamiltonian makes the physical construction of such a system unlikely .",
    "in contrast , we can choose a set of pairwise ising interactions that generate the same group .",
    "a natural choice would be the line @xmath32",
    "@xmath33 @xmath43 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath44 @xmath36 @xmath45 but it is well - known that the 1d ising model does not have a phase transition at finite temperature . we instead consider a model where the encoded bits are ising coupled middle to middle not end to end : @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath46 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath47 @xmath36 @xmath45 .",
