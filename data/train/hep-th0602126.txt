    "the description of perturbative quantum field theory in terms of hopf algebras @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) has led to a better understanding of the combinatorial structure of renormalization . at the same time",
    ", it provided a beautiful interaction of quantum field theory with several parts of mathematics .",
    "although the hopf algebra was modelled on a scalar quantum field theory , it can be generalized to any quantum field theory .",
    "however , subtleties appear in the case of quantum gauge theories .",
    "gauge theories are field theories that are invariant under a certain group , known as the gauge group . in the process of renormalization",
    ", one has to deal with the ` overcounting ' due to the gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , one has to understand how the gauge symmetries manifest themselves in the quantum field theory .",
    "important here are the so - called ward - takahashi ( or slavnov - taylor ) identities .    the first example of a gauge theory is quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , which has the abelian group @xmath1 as a gauge group .",
    "the hopf algebraic structure of feynman graphs in qed was desrcibed in @xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "a slightly different approach is taken in @xcite , where hopf algebras on planar binary trees were considered .",
    "the anatomy of a gauge theory with gauge group @xmath2 ( known as quantum chromodynamics ) has been discussed in the hopf algebra setting in @xcite , with a central role played by the dyson - schwinger equations ( see also @xcite ) . however , a full understanding of renormalization of general gauge theories is still incomplete .",
    "this paper is a modest attempt towards understanding this by working out explicitly the hopf algebraic structure underlying renormalization of quantum electrodynamics , thereby implementing the ward - takahashi identities in a compatible way .",
    "we start in section [ sect : hopf ] by defining the commutative hopf algebra @xmath3 of feynman graphs for quantum electrodynamics . the approach we take differs from the one in @xcite where a noncommutative hopf algebra was considered .",
    "this was motivated by the fact that in qed , feynman amplitudes are ( noncommuting ) matrices .",
    "instead , we work with a commutative hopf algebra and encode the matricial form of the feynman amplitudes into the distributions giving the external structure of the graph .",
    "our approach has the advantage of still being able to use the duality between commutative hopf algebras and affine group schemes in the formulation of the bphz - procedure .    in section [",
    "sect : birkhoff ] , we associate a feynman amplitude to a feynman graph , as dictated by the feynman rules .",
    "the bphz - formula of renormalization is obtained as a special case of the birkhoff decomposition for affine group schemes @xcite .",
    "then in section [ sect : wt ] , we incorporate the ward - takahashi ( wt ) identities as relations between graphs , much as was done by t hooft and veltman in @xcite .",
    "we show that these relations are compatible with the coproduct in the hopf algebra @xmath3 , so that they define a hopf ideal .",
    "this reflects the physical fact that wt - identities are compatible with renormalization ( in the dimensional regularization and minimal subtraction scheme ) .",
    "the feynman amplitudes can now be defined on the quotient hopf algebra of @xmath3 by this ideal , and we conclude that the counterterms as well as the renormalized feynman amplitudes satisfy the wt - identities in the physical sense ( i.e. , between feynman amplitudes ) . in particular , we arrive at the well - known identity @xmath0 as derived by ward in @xcite .",
    "quantum electrodynamics in 4 dimensions is given by the following classical lagrangian , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the _ field strength _ of the _ gauge potential _ @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the spinor describing the electron with mass @xmath8 and electric charge @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the @xmath11 dirac matrices .",
    "finally , the real parameter @xmath12 is the _ gauge - fixing parameter_.    the lagrangian @xmath13 describes the dynamics and the interaction as well as the gauge fixing : we can write @xmath14 , where the free , interaction and gauge fixing parts are @xmath15 the adjective `` quantum '' for electrodynamics is justified when this lagrangian is used in computing probability amplitudes . in perturbation theory , one expands such amplitudes in terms of feynman diagrams which are the graphs constructed from the following vertices , as dictated by the form of the lagrangian :    ( 60,60 )    ( 60,60 )    ( 60,60 )    [ rem : el - mass ] in fact , we will also need the 2-point vertex    ( 40,10 )    , associated to the electron mass term , similar to @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the so - called _ one - particle irreducible _ ( 1pi ) _ graphs _ , which are graphs that are not trees , and that can not be disconnected by cutting a single internal edge . in qed , there are three types of 1pi graphs that are of interest in renormalization theory : the vacuum polarization , the electron self - energy and the full vertex graphs :    ( 60,60 )     +    ( 60,60 )     +    ( 60,60 )    here the blob stands for any 1pi graph of the type dictated by the external lines .",
    "we now describe the _ external structure _ of a feynman graph @xmath16 , assigning ( among other data ) momenta to the external legs . in physics ,",
    "the feynman amplitude of @xmath16 ( dictated by the feynman rules , see below ) is evaluated with respect to this external structure ( see below ) .",
    "mathematically , the external structure is a distribution on the space of feynman amplitudes , understood as test functions on a suitable space .",
    "more explicitly , in the case of qed the ( euclidean ) feynman amplitudes @xmath17 are functions in @xmath18 where @xmath19 with @xmath20 the set of indices labelling the external photon lines of @xmath16 with spatial index @xmath21 respectively , and @xmath22 is the set of its external electron lines .",
    "the factor @xmath23 can be understood from the fact that in qed , feynman amplitudes are matrix - valued functions on @xmath24 .    for qed , the external structure",
    "is thus given by an element in the space of distributions on @xmath18 ; we denote this space by @xmath25 .",
    "for example , for the above full vertex graph @xmath16 , @xmath26 and a typical distribution is given by @xmath27 in terms of a dirac mass and the ( standard ) dual basis @xmath28 of @xmath29 .",
    "evaluation on the feynman amplitude @xmath30 is then given by the pairing @xmath31 note that @xmath32 is translated in the diagram by a reversal of the corresponding arrow with associated momentum @xmath33 .",
    "we will be interested in the following special external structures for the different graphs introduced above .",
    "a full vertex graph @xmath34 at zero momentum transfer ( meaning @xmath35 ) can be written in terms of the two form factors @xmath36 ( cf .",
    "* section 6.2 ) ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "only the first form factor @xmath39 requires renormalization ; therefore , we define the following external structure : @xmath40 where the normalization comes from @xmath41 . for the ward - takahashi identities , we will also need the following external structure , @xmath42 which puts finite momentum @xmath43 on the ingoing and outgoing electron lines , but zero momentum on the external photon line ( zero - momentum transfer ) .",
    "this external structure allows us to treat ward - takahashi identities in massless qed as well .",
    "the form factors @xmath39 and @xmath44 can also be recovered separately by using the following two distributions @xcite , @xmath45    for an electron self - energy graph @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 and the corresponding feynman amplitude is written in terms of two form factors : @xmath48 correspondingly , there are two distributions , which we choose of the form , @xmath49 for all @xmath50 . also , there is an external structure which puts finite momentum on the ingoing and outgoing electron lines , @xmath51    finally , for a vacuum polarization graph @xmath16 , @xmath52 , we let @xmath53 be the external structure that satisfies @xmath54 for all @xmath55 .",
    "the labelling of the external structures by @xmath56 and @xmath57 differs from the one in @xcite , where they were labelled by @xmath58 and @xmath59 . here",
    "we follow @xcite , so that the labels correspond to the renormalization constants @xmath60 , as they appear in the lagrangian , @xmath61 the precise correspondence will be given in equation below .",
    "let @xmath3 be the free commutative algebra generated by pairs @xmath62 with @xmath16 a 1pi graph and @xmath63 a distribution encoding its external structure .",
    "the product in @xmath3 can be understood as the union of graphs , with induced external structure .",
    "more precisely , for two 1pi graphs @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the product @xmath66 is the graph @xmath67 with external structure given by @xmath68 .",
    "the algebra @xmath3 is a ( positively ) graded algebra @xmath69 , with the grading given by the loop number of the graph .    in the following",
    ", we will also write @xmath64 for the pair @xmath70 , and sometimes even @xmath16 . we will shorten the notation for graphs equipped with the special external structures defined above by writing @xmath71 .",

    "in general , @xmath74 can be written as a union @xmath220 , where @xmath221 consists of electron self - energy graphs , @xmath222 of full vertex graphs , @xmath223 of vacuum polarization graphs and @xmath224 of electron self - energy graphs with a photon line inserted at the @xmath163th electron line ( with this labelling inherited from @xmath16 ) .",
    "graphs of the type @xmath225 and @xmath226 do not appear in the sum , because there are no corresponding vertices of valence 3 and 4 in qed .",
    "note that the multi - index @xmath78 only affects the subgraphs in @xmath221 , for each of which it can take the values @xmath227 and @xmath83 .",
    "we split the above sum in a term in which @xmath228 contains the electron line @xmath163 as an internal line and those in which it does not : @xmath229 where @xmath230 .",
    "we will write @xmath231 for the two terms appearing in equation .    before examining the terms @xmath111 and @xmath232 , we note that for each @xmath74 , @xmath221 can be split into ` blocks ' each of which appear in the graph @xmath16 by concatenation of electron self - energy graphs ( as in figure [ figure - blocks ] ) .",
    "we will denote such blocks by @xmath233 and write @xmath208 as @xmath234 where @xmath198 is the electron line corresponding to @xmath197 in the quotient @xmath199 . in words",
    ", we separated the sum over the internal electron lines @xmath163 of @xmath221 into a sum over all blocks @xmath235 in @xmath221 , together with a sum over its connected components @xmath197 and a sum over the internal electron lines that are part of @xmath197 .",
    "then , with @xmath236 , the quotient @xmath237 is given by the replacement of @xmath197 by a 3-vertex , followed by the quotient by the other graphs that constitute @xmath74 , and with external structure inherited from @xmath164 .",
    "note that since @xmath238 is a full vertex graph , there is only the external structure @xmath239 .",
    "this fixes @xmath240 inside the multi - index @xmath78 to be @xmath83 , and by a slight abuse of notation , we let @xmath78 also denote the external structures of the elements in @xmath241 .",
    "the term @xmath207 can be split in a sum over @xmath163 of electron lines that are external edges for @xmath221 and those that are not , @xmath242 again , we will write this in terms of the blocks @xmath235 forming @xmath221 : @xmath243 where the first term arises from @xmath163 being the ingoing line of @xmath197 for @xmath244 and the second term from @xmath163 being the outgoing line for @xmath245 , thus equal to the sum of all external edges in @xmath235 .",
    "writing explicitly the two terms for @xmath246 one obtains , @xmath247 where in the first line , we have used the fact that @xmath248 , in the above notation .",
    "since each vertex    ( 20,11 )    adds an electron line to @xmath16 , we can combine the last three terms to obtain @xmath249 thus , we obtain for the sum of @xmath111 and @xmath232 , @xmath250 where we recognize the wt - element @xmath209 for each 1pi self - energy graph @xmath251 , @xmath252 combining the second term in equation with the two other terms in @xmath213 ( which involve the coproduct @xmath253 , it follows that @xmath254 so that @xmath255 .",
    "the other inclusions @xmath256 and @xmath257 follow from the latter equation by the definitions of @xmath177 and @xmath178 in terms of @xmath173 .",
    "we have shown that the ward - takahashi identities can be implemented on the hopf algebra of feynman graphs of qed as relations that define a hopf ideal .",
    "the quotient hopf algebra @xmath179 by this hopf ideal is still commutative but has the wt - identities ` built in ' .",
    "the feynman amplitudes @xmath157 on @xmath179 defined by equation therefore automatically satisfy the wt - identities in the physical sense ( i.e. between feynman amplitudes )",
    ". moreover , theorem [ birkhoff ] applies and shows that the counterterms and the renormalized feynman amplitudes are given in terms of the algebra maps @xmath258 and @xmath259 , respectively . in particular , the counterterms as well as the renormalized feynman amplitudes",
    "satisfy the wt - identities .",
    "the well - known relation @xmath0 between the renormalization constants as derived by ward in @xcite is now an easy consequence of their definition in , @xmath260 in the first line we have used the fact that the contribution @xmath261 vanishes whenever @xmath163 is part of an electron loop , as follows by explicit computation using the feynman rules ( cf .",
