    "the critical behavior of the random field ising model ( rfim ) has been investigated intensively over two decades now ( see @xcite for a review ) but a full agreement over the most fundamental issues still missing . although it has been shown rigorously @xcite that at low temperatures and sufficiently small field strength there is indeed long range ferromagnetic order in three dimensions , the characterization of the phase transition is still unclear .",
    "the idea of dimensional reduction @xcite failed to describe the critical behavior of the model correctly .",
    "the reason for this was essentially the presence of many local minima in the free energy landscape that do not allow for a straightforward perturbative treatment .",
    "a reminiscence of dimensional reduction is still present in the scaling theories for the rfim @xcite , where the dimension @xmath9 has been replaced by @xmath10 in hyper - scaling relations and @xmath11 was introduced as a third exponent independent of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "however , these ( droplet)-theories relied upon the assumption of a second order phase transition . part of the results obtained via monte carlo simulations support this scenario @xcite , whereas other simulations find indications for the transition to be of first order @xcite .",
    "more surprisingly no latent heat was found at the transition @xcite , contrary to what one might expect at a first order phase transition @xcite , where a discontinuity in the internal energy at the critical point causes the specific heat to diverge with the volume of the system .",
    "actually no divergence at all could be detected for the specific heat @xcite .",
    "the experimental situation is also far from clear .",
    "experiments on diluted antiferromagnets in an uniform external field ( daff ) , which have been demonstrated to be in the same universality class as the rfim @xcite , provided evidence for a second order phase transition with varying estimates for the critical exponents ( for a discussion see @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "a logarithmic singularity for the specific heat was found , implying @xmath14 .",
    "quite recently , subsequent to the prediction made in @xcite , experimental evidence of a cusp - like singularity of the specific heat , i.e.  @xmath15 , was reported @xcite .",
    "moreover , other possible scenarios , like a first order transition @xcite or a so called `` trompe loeil critical behavior '' @xcite have also been discussed .",
    "experiments addressing the equilibrium quantities of the rfim ( or the daff , respectively ) are extremely difficult to perform , since by approaching the transition the system falls out of equilibrium very rapidly and freezes into a metastable domain state ( see @xcite for a review )",
    ". therefore these issues have not been settled by now .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to estimate _ all _ critical exponents with the help of extensive monte carlo investigations of the rfim in three dimensions . in a recent paper results for the exponents of the rfim with a binary distribution",
    "were presented @xcite . in mean field theory @xcite",
    "there is a sharp discrepancy between the phase diagram for a binary distribution and that of a continuous distribution with a finite probability for zero random fields : in the former case the phase diagram has a tritcritical point , where the phase transition changes from second order for low fields to first order at higher fields ; in the latter case the transition is always of second order .",
    "one might speculate that a similar scenario occurs also in three dimensions and that the indications found in @xcite for a first order transition are in fact an artifact of the binary distribution .",
    "therefore it is important to perform a similar analysis for a continuous distribution , which is presented in this paper .",
    "it is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the model and review various scaling predictions that are supposed to hold in case he transition is of second order . section 3 reports our results of the finite size scaling analysis and section 4 discusses the possibility of a first order transition .",
    "section 5 is a summarize and an outlook .",
    "the random field ising model ( rfim ) in three dimensions is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath16 where @xmath17 are ising spins , the first sum is over nearest neighbor pairs on a simple cubic lattice and the @xmath18 are independent quenched random variables with mean zero @xmath19_{\\rm av}=0 $ ] and variance @xmath20_{\\rm av}=h_r^2 $ ] .",
    "it has been shown rigorously @xcite that this model has a transition to long range ferromagnetic order along a line @xmath21 in the @xmath22-diagram .",
    "if this transition is second order , a scaling theory has been proposed @xcite that relies upon the assumption that random field induced fluctuations dominate over thermal fluctuations at @xmath23 .",
    "this implies for the singular part of the free energy @xmath24 where @xmath0 is the correlation length diverging at the critical temperature like @xmath25 and @xmath11 is a new exponent .",
    "random field fluctuations alone produce typically an excess field of the order of @xmath26 within a correlation volume , so a naive guess would be @xmath11 roughly 1.5 in three dimensions . from ( [ fsing ] )",
    "the modified hyper - scaling relation follows @xmath27 @xmath28 being the specific heat exponent .",
    "it also implies an exponential divergence of the relaxation time @xmath29 at @xmath23 : @xmath30 .",
    "the decay of the connected and disconnected correlation functions at @xmath23 @xmath31_{\\rm av } & \\sim r^{-(d-2+\\eta ) }                 \\label{corr}\\\\ c_{\\rm dis } ( { \\bf r } ) = & \\lbrack\\langle s_0 \\rangle\\langle s_r \\rangle\\rbrack_{\\rm av } & \\sim r^{-(d-4+\\overline{\\eta } ) }      \\label{corrdis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] defines two exponents @xmath13 and @xmath32 .",
    "these are expected @xcite to be related to the new exponent @xmath11 via @xmath33 by approaching the critical temperature from above the corresponding connected and disconnected susceptibilities diverge as @xmath34 these exponents are related by @xmath35 in addition one has the usual scaling relations for the magnetization exponent @xmath36 and the rusbrooke equality @xmath37 obviously there seem to be three independent critical exponents and a central issue of the activities on the critical properties of the rfim is the quest for an additional scaling relation . already imry and ma @xcite conjectured that @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the susceptibility .",
    "this would imply @xmath40 via ( [ fsing ] ) and therefore with ( [ theta ] ) @xmath41 a set of analytical arguments by schwartz et al.@xcite supports this two - exponent scaling scenario indicated by ( [ twoexp ] ) .",
    "hence the exact schwartz - soffer inequality @xcite @xmath42 might be fulfilled as an equality , as in ( [ twoexp ] ) . a recent high temperature series analysis provided @xcite strong evidence of this equality to hold by estimating @xmath43 and @xmath44 via pad - approximation .    in this paper",
    "we intend to determine _ all _ critical exponents with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the model is defined by the hamiltonian ( [ model ] ) on a finite lattice of linear size @xmath45 with periodic boundary conditions . instead of a binary distribution , as used in @xcite",
    ", we consider here a gaussian distribution @xmath46 for the random fields .",
    "unfortunately this makes the use of multispin coding impossible @xcite , which slows down the spin - update algorithm ( metropolis ) by approximately a factor 10 .",
    "the simulations were done at a constant ratio @xmath47 .    as was pointed out in @xcite",
    "it is of paramount importance to perform an extensive disorder average , since quantities like the susceptibility @xmath48 are non - self - averaging in this model .",
    "therefore at least 1000 samples for each temperature and system size were used .",
    "equilibration was checked by starting each sample with two different initial configurations , one with all spins down and the other with all spin up , and running as long as both `` replica '' yield the same values for all thermodynamic quantities of interest . for @xmath49",
    "up to @xmath50 monte carlo sweeps were necessary to fulfill this criterion .",
    "the following quantities were calculated for each disorder realization : the average magnetization per spin @xmath51 , its square @xmath52 , the average energy per spin @xmath53 and its square @xmath54 .",
    "the angular brackets , @xmath55 , denote a thermal average for a single random field configuration and @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . from these data",
    "we get the specific heat per spin , @xmath59 , the susceptibility @xmath48 , the disconnected susceptibility , @xmath60 , and the order parameter , @xmath61 , as follows @xmath62_{\\rm av } & = & n\\bigl\\{[\\langle e^2\\rangle]_{\\rm av } -[\\langle e\\rangle^2]_{{\\rm",

    "the finite size scaling function of any quantity @xmath64 , which behaves in the infinite system like @xmath65 by approaching the critical temperature , reads @xmath66 in case of the specific heat the scaling function @xmath67 has a maximum at some value @xmath68 . for each lattice",
    " size we estimate the temperature @xmath69 , where @xmath70_{\\rm av}$ ] is maximal . since @xmath71 we obtain in this way the critical temperature @xmath23 and the correlation length exponent @xmath12 from @xmath72 we denote the value of @xmath73_{\\rm av}$ ] at this temperature @xmath69 by @xmath74_{\\rm av}$ ] and similarly for the other quantities in eq .",

    "the scaling function @xmath67 can be approximated by a parabola .",
    "therefore three temperatures near the maximum of the specific heat are enough to determine the values of @xmath69 as well as @xmath74_{\\rm av}$ ] etc . let us assume that we measured @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 for temperatures @xmath85 . in order to get a reliable estimate for @xmath86 as well as its errorbar we have to have @xmath87 and @xmath88 ,",
    "hence it is important to have very small statistical errors @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . the difference between the temperatures should be small , otherwise the second order polynomial approximation fails , but not too small , since then the above requirement for the difference between @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 can not be fulfilled .",
    "we used @xmath95 for the small lattice sizes ( @xmath96 ) and @xmath97 for the larger sizes .",
    "once @xmath69 is determined , the value of the quantities in ( [ cmax]-[mag ] ) are again determined by fitting a second order polynomial .",
    "finally , the exponents are determined via least square fits of the data obtained to the functional forms given in ( [ cmax]-[mag ] ) .",
    "first we determine the temperature @xmath69 , where the maximum of the specific heat occurs and fit the correlation length exponent @xmath12 in such a way that the data for @xmath69 lie on a straight line if plotted against @xmath98",
    ". then relation ( [ tc ] ) is fulfilled and @xmath23 can be read of from the intersection of this line with the @xmath99-axis .",
    "the result is depicted in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) , one obtains @xmath100    next we analyse the size - dependence of maximum of the specific heat . according to ( [ cmax ] )",
    "one should be able to read off the exponent - ratio @xmath101 from the slope of a straight line fit in a log - log plot of @xmath74_{\\rm av}$ ] versus @xmath45 .",
    "the first observation is that this procedure does not work since the data points show a significant negative curvature in a log - log plot , indicating a much weaker dependency then algebraic . in reminiscence of",
    "the experimental finding of a _ logarithmic _ divergence of the specific heat ( i.e.  @xmath14 ) we plotted @xmath74_{\\rm av}$ ] versus @xmath102 , and still found a ( now less pronounced ) negative curvature in the data points , indicating a still weaker or even no divergence .",
    "finally we hypothesized a cusp - like singularity , i.e.   @xmath103_{\\rm av } \\sim l^{\\alpha/\\nu}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 .",
    "the result of the corresponding fitting procedure is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "as one can see the data are fully consistent with this type of dependency and we get @xmath104    with the estimate for @xmath12 from ( [ nufit ] ) it is @xmath105 . although the ratio @xmath101 can be determined quite accurately , the value for @xmath28 alone depends on @xmath12 which has a much larger large error bar .    according to ( [ chi ] )",
    "the susceptibility at the temperature @xmath69 should diverge algebraically , and the exponent @xmath13 is obtained by a least square straight line fit of @xmath75_{\\rm av}$ ] versus @xmath45 in a log - log plot , which is depicted in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the result is @xmath106 from which one obtains via ( [ gamma ] ) @xmath107 .",
    "the finite size scaling behavior of @xmath48 near the critical temperature is expected to be @xmath108_{\\rm av}(t , l ) \\approx l^{2-\\eta}\\tilde{\\chi}\\bigl(l^{1/\\nu}(t - t_c)\\bigr)\\;.\\ ] ] in figure [ fig4 ] the corresponding finite size scaling plot using the values for @xmath23 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 from ( [ nufit ] ) and ( [ etafit ] ) is shown .",
    "the disconnected susceptibility at @xmath69 is depicted in figure [ fig5 ] , which should diverge according to ( [ chid ] ) with system size . via a least square fit of the data to a straight line in the log - log plot one",
    "obtains the estimate @xmath109    with the scaling relation ( [ theta ] ) one can estimate @xmath11 to be @xmath110 which is in good agreement with the value @xmath111 mentioned in the last section .    comparing our values for @xmath13 ( [ etafit ] ) and @xmath32 ( [ etabfit ] ) one",
    "notes that the relation ( [ twoexp ] ) might be fulfilled , which would support the two - exponent scaling scenario mentioned in the last section .",
    "in order to check this we calculated the amplitude ratio @xmath112_{\\rm av } } { [ \\chi]_{\\rm av}^2(h_r / t)^2}\\;. \\label{amp}\\ ] ] as suggested in @xcite , where in an extensive high - temperature analysis it was found that @xmath113 , implying strong evidence for two - exponent scaling . the finite size scaling form of ( [ amp ] ) is @xmath114 and",
    "therefore we expect @xmath115 independent of system size .",
    "the result that we obtain from our mc - data is table 1 :    [ cols=\"^,>,^,^,<,^,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.2 cm table ii : the critical exponents for the gaussian distribution considered in this paper and for the binary distribution investigated in ref .",
    ", both for the constant field - strength / temperature ratio @xmath116 0.3 cm    the first important observation is that the results obtained for a gaussian and a binary distribution do not differ significantly .",
    "in particular the indications for a discontinuity in the magnetization @xmath8 detected for the binary distribution in ref .  @xcite are also present for the gaussian distribution investigated in this paper .",
    "this is a crucial point with regards to mean - field theory @xcite , where an essential difference between the two kinds of distributions is predicted : in contrast to the continuous case with nonvanishing weight at zero field strength the binary distribution is expected to have a tricritical point , where the transition changes from second to first order .",
    "our conclusion in this paper is that in three dimensions both distributions lead to identical results for the investigated field strength .",
    "our estimate for the correlation length exponent @xmath12 has a rather large errorbar , which is also the main source for the error in the values for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath28 .",
    "one notes also a discrepancy between the values of @xmath12 for the gaussian and for the binary distribution , but they remain compatible within the errorbars .",
    "the schwartz - soffer inequality @xmath42 seems to be fulfilled as an equality , which supports the two - exponent scaling scenario , as also found in @xcite .",
    "an explicit calculation of the amplitude ration in section iii gives further evidence in this respect .",
    "the analysis of the probability distribution of the susceptibility showed pronounced long tails as predicted by the scaling theories @xcite .",
    "the source for these long tails are rare samples possessing a vanishing net - field and thus having a vanishing expectation value for the magnetization .",
    "in fact these rare samples provide the dominant contribution to the higher moments of the distribution , which we checked explicitly .",
    "the analysis of the probability distribution of the magnetization supports this picture and shows that the probability of these rare samples indeed decays like @xmath117 with system size , where @xmath11 is an exponent whose value turns out to be compatible with other predictions of the scaling theory .",
    "it turns out that the magnetization exponent @xmath80 is zero , which means that the magnetization jumps discontinuously from zero to a finite value at the critical temperature .",
    "although this might be called a first order phase transition a closer inspection of the probability distribution of the magnetization revealed the absence of a double - peak structure characterizing the phase - coexistence usually present at a first order phase transition .",
    "furthermore , at a first order phase transition the specific heat usually diverges with the volume of the system @xcite , but the exponent @xmath28 is negative , which means that the specific heat does not diverge at @xmath23 . by means of birefringence techniques belanger et al .",
    "@xcite concluded from their experiments on fe@xmath118zn@xmath119f@xmath120 that @xmath14 ( i.e.  a logarithmic divergence of the specific heat ) .",
    "only recently it was shown @xcite that the same kind of experiments on fe@xmath121mg@xmath122br@xmath120 are better compatible with a cusp like singularity of the specific heat and @xmath123 , concurring with the value reported in table ii . however , this value for @xmath28 together with the other estimates in table ii would violate the modified hyper - scaling relation ( [ hyper ] ) . moreover , schwartz @xcite derived an exact inequality @xmath124 and accepting @xmath125 ( since this result has a much smaller errorbar than @xmath12 ) it would imply @xmath126 , which is a rather large value . indeed in a recent migdal - kadanoff@xcite such a large exponent was found : @xmath127 , and also report @xmath128 and @xmath129 , consistent with table ii . however , a value for @xmath28 that is negative and large in modulus causes serious difficulties with respect to the rushbrooke relation ( [ rushbrooke ] ) and the more rigorous rushbrooke inequality @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "let us conclude with the remark that this investigation on one hand confirms the picture of the phase transition scenario found in ref.@xcite . on the other hand it poses some serious puzzles concerning various scaling relations for the exponents that still remain to be solved in the future .",
    "in addition quite recently the possibility of an intermediate spin glass phase , located between the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic phase has been discussed @xcite .",
    "it seems to us to be quite important to clarify the consequences of the existence such a phase , which is supposed to posses a _",
    "finite _ correlation length , for the nature of the transition considered here .",
