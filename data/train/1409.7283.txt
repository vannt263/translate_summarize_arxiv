    "in nonlinear dynamics , semiconductors behave as dissipative systems and can show , when placed under controlled conditions , a nonlinear electrical transport regime .",
    "a classical example is the semi - insulating gallium arsenide ( si - gaas ) material , which have nonlinear characteristic curves of the longitudinal current density as a function of the applied electric field @xmath0 , j(@xmath0 ) , with negative differential conductivity in a n - shaped form ( nndc),when high electric fields are applied , even at room temperature .    in the nndc curves of si - gaas , it is possible to observe experimentally spontaneous electrical field oscillations namely the low - current oscillations ( lfo ) @xcite .",
    "the time series of the lfo s , can be analyzed using nonlinear tools in order to create a bifurcation map where self - organized patterns are observed .",
    "it is important to note that the lfos are associated with the ndc curve of the material , and not to an oscillation of a circuit or device , as in the case of the gunns diode @xcite and chua s diode @xcite .",
    "other materials such as n - type gaas , at cryogenic temperatures ( e.g. , 4.2k ) , shows the s - shaped form for ndc ( sndc ) induced by the phenomena of impact ionization of shallow donors and field enhanced trapping @xcite . the most consolidated model to explain this behavior in materials with shallow - level is the well known  two - level model \" , as proposed by e. schll @xcite . in schll s model the conduction band ( cb ) , the fundamental level of the defect ( 1s - ground state at 5.9 mev below the ( cb ) and its first excited level ( 2p - excited state at 1.5 mev below the ( cb ) are the energy - levels responsible for the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "self - organized patterns arise from the generation - recombination ( g - r ) rate equations as a function of the applied electric field @xcite .",
    "all studied models until now based on g - r rate equations , not used the nndc curve to explain the experimental results in si - gaas , only the sndc characteristic . in order to cope with this problem ,",
    "in this work we had proposed an alternative physical model for the conduction phenomena in si - gaas that successfully generates the nndc curve and consequently the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the two - levels inside the band - gap of the schlls model were replaced by two valleys , namely the @xmath1 and l - valley inside the conduction band and we named our model as the `` two - valley model '' .    in the  two - valley model \" the first excited state of the defect was eliminated , the fundamental level of the deep - defect was preserved , assuming as deep level , and the conduction mechanisms involving the two valleys @xcite of the gaas were introduced .",
    "this new model proposed by us is similar to the intervalley transfer of the gunn effect @xcite , but the energy levels involved , and the dynamics are very different , since in the gunn effect , we are dealing with the regime of high frequency oscillations ( ghz range ) and at very low temperatures ( t @xmath2 10k ) . besides that",
    ", the models proposed to explain the gunn effect were not designed to study the nonlinear dynamics , they are only used to explain the high frequency oscillations that emerge from this device and not to study their physical properties @xcite .    by solving the g - r rate equations for our model we successfully produced the nndc region in the j(@xmath0 ) curves and the nonlinear dynamics are present , as spontaneously low frequency ( sub - hz to about sub - ghz ) current oscillations , the lfo s .    in this paper",
    "the phenomenology of the nonlinear nndc curve will be evaluated in detail , by a group of different attractors , and their correspondent bifurcation diagram .",
    "we have also analyzed the time series using a standard periodicity - detection ( pd ) routine @xcite , implemented in labview , and the parameter - space of the periodicity ( bifurcation diagram codimension - two ) was built with the reconstructed attractors .    within the  two - valley model \" we now have an appropriate model to study the nonlinear electrical conduction of the si - gaas system that has been doubt for the past years , since until this time , no model could generate the nndc curve of si - gaas .",
    "the nonlinear conduction of si - gaas includes periodic and chaotic regimes , bifurcation routes to chaos , periodic structures immersed in chaotic regions , as those observed experimentally @xcite .    although the bifurcation phenomena involving only one control parameter ( codimension - one ) are reasonably understood today , when we increase the number of control parameters , we experience the emergence of complex codimension - two periodic regions immersed in chaotic regions forming self - similar structures , as shrimps @xcite , that still needed a full theoretical and experimental description .",
    "the knowledge of this complex periodic region is important to fulfill the requirements for secure communications with chaos @xcite , since with a periodic - attractor no information can be encrypted for communication .    in this work , we proposed a model ,  the two - valley model \" , that are based on rate equations with the minimal set of generation - recombination equations for two valleys inside of the conduction band , and an equation for the drift velocity as a function of the applied electric field , which considers a conduction mechanism involving the two valleys on conduction band and the fundamental level of the deep - defect , present in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "our numerical results are capable to generate theoretically the nndc region , and in section 4 the nonlinear dynamics will be investigated through the attractors built by a combination of the time series of the defect density and the electric field .",
    "many periodic and chaotic regimes are observed in the bifurcation diagram as well as a period - doubling bifurcation route - to - chaos with odd - periodic windows . in the same section",

    "experimentally , it is well known that under high electric fields the drift velocity of free electrons in gaas is nonlinear because it involves mixed conduction in @xmath1 and l valleys with different mobility values and with @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xcite .",

    "they depend implicitly upon the electric field through the rate constants , e.g. impact ionization coefficient , field enhanced trapping coefficient and coefficients involving the @xmath1 and l valleys . since the total number of electrons is conserved by g - r processes , @xmath23+@xmath24+@xmath22= 0 holds @xcite .    using normalized variables @xcite for the charge density of the fundamental state of the deep level defect , n@xmath15 , the charge density in the @xmath1 valley , n@xmath14 , and those respective derivatives , and the dimensionless time @xmath25 , length @xmath26 , and @xmath0 electrical field variables , we have :    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    where @xmath19 is the effective donor density , @xmath31 is the effective relaxation time , @xmath20 dielectric constant , @xmath32 debye effective length , @xmath33 diffusion constant , _ e _ electron charge , @xmath34 boltzmann s constant , t temperature and @xmath35 mobility .",
