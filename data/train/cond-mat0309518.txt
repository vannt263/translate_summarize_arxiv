    "the class of decision problems that can be solved in nondeterministic polynomial time , known as the np class , is central to the theory of computational complexity .",
    "informally , a decision problem is in np if its solution can be checked to be correct in polynomial time .",
    "obtaining that solution , however , is altogether a different matter : for some problems it can be done in polynomial time as well , while for others it is as yet unknown whether a polynomial - time procedure exists .",
    "in order to characterize such seemingly harder problems , it has proven useful to look at the problems that are `` complete '' for np ( the so - called np - complete problems ) , that is , problems in np for which the discovery of a polynomial - time procedure to find a solution would immediately warrant the existence of such a procedure for all the other problems in np as well @xcite .",
    "the np - complete problems are thus the hardest problems in np , and are in a sense essentially equivalent to one another in terms of how hard they are to be solved @xcite .",
    "but it has been known already for many years , both from practical experience ( e.g. , @xcite ) and from looking at the minutiae of the structure of np @xcite , that some np - complete problems are in fact harder than others , and that a given np - complete problem may have instances that are significantly harder than other instances of the same problem . following some initial results of about one decade ago @xcite ,",
    "it is now known that , for np - complete problems like satisfiability and its derivations @xcite and graph coloring @xcite , sharp phase transitions with respect to some order parameter exist and are frequently correlated with the hardness of finding a solution .",
    "we are concerned in this paper with combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "hard optimization problems have been characterized in much the same way as their decision - form counterparts . by a minor technicality , however",
    ", they are best termed np - hard problems ( as opposed to np - complete problems ) to indicate only that they are at least as hard as the problems in np ( but not necessarily one of them ) @xcite .",
    "invariably , an optimization problem whose decision - form variant is np - complete , is np - hard .    unlike decision problems",
    ", optimization problems are only now beginning to be looked at in order to explain the relative hardness of their instances , but we already have some empirical evidence of the presence of similar phase transitions @xcite . in the case of graph coloring , for example , the optimization problem asks for the graph s chromatic number  the least number of colors needed to assign one color to each node without ever assigning the same color to neighbors in the graph ( i.e. , nodes that are connected by an edge ) .",
    "what is known for this problem comes from considering a sequence of graphs of increasing density ( number of edges per node ) and what happens along this sequence at the points in which the chromatic number increases .",
    "it has been discovered that finding the chromatic number just before these points is distinctly harder than just after them . also , sharp peaks in the size of the so - called backbone of each graph in the sequence are detected just before those points as well , thus indicating a strong positive correlation between problem hardness and backbone size .",
    "a graph s backbone in this case is the set of node pairs that are assigned the same color by every coloring that employs a number of colors given by the graph s chromatic number .",
    "so a graph with a large backbone presents many opportunities for an algorithm that seeks the optimum to waste time trying to assign two different colors to a node pair that belongs to the backbone .",
    "coloring a graph optimally is one of the problems that we treat in this paper .",
    "while the backbone size relates clearly , in an intuitive way , to why larger backbones tend to imply harder instances of the problem , we feel that it lends little combinatorial insight into the hardness of those instances , specifically into how the structure of the graph affects the hardness of coloring its nodes optimally .",
    "our contribution in the context of this problem , presented in section  [ coloring ] , is to demonstrate that other indicators exist that relate just as clearly to the appearance of phase transitions related to the hardness of graph coloring while at the same time carrying what we think is better combinatorial intuition .",
    "the indicators we use come from considering a graph s chromatic polynomial and its set of acyclic orientations .",
    "the latter brings us to the second problem of interest in this paper , treated in section  [ mis ] , which is the problem of finding an independent set of maximum cardinality in a graph .",
    "an independent set is a set of nodes that includes no neighbors .",
    "the cardinality of a maximum independent set of a graph is the graph s independence number . finding this number is also an np - hard problem , one that shares with optimal graph coloring a clean combinatorial interpretation in terms of the graph s acyclic orientations .",
    "this problem does not appear to have already been examined for phase transitions related to the hardness of its instances .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we use @xmath0 ( or simply @xmath1 , if @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be inferred from the context ) to denote an undirected graph with @xmath2 nodes and @xmath3 edges .",
    "all our empirical results are based on fixed sequences of graphs , each graph with @xmath2 nodes but increasingly more edges ( up to @xmath4 ) . for @xmath5 , the @xmath6th graph in this sequence , denoted by @xmath7 or simply by @xmath8 , has @xmath2 nodes , @xmath6 edges , and is generated according to the random - graph model that samples uniformly from the set of all graphs having the same number of nodes and edges @xcite ( equivalently , for @xmath9 , @xmath10 may be regarded as being obtained from @xmath8 by the random addition of a new edge ) .    using one single sequence as the basis of each experiment precludes the smoothing effect of taking averages over larger ensembles , known to mask the appearance of very sharp phase transitions for problems like graph coloring @xcite .",
    "we are always careful , however , to make sure that the observed phenomena are also present , qualitatively , in several other sequences .    for small values of @xmath6 ,",
    "a graph @xmath8 in the sequence @xmath11 is likely to have isolated nodes ( nodes without neighbors ) .",
    "such nodes do not affect the graph s chromatic number , and affect its independence number only trivially ( every isolated node is a member of all maximum independent sets ) .",
    "so the sequence that is actually used in all our experiments is the sequence @xmath12 , where , for @xmath5 , @xmath13 is obtained by stripping @xmath8 of its isolated nodes .    before proceeding , we pause momentarily to consider this issue of isolated nodes more carefully .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the number of isolated nodes of @xmath8 .",
    "we have @xmath15 , while for @xmath9 it is easy to see that @xmath16 where @xmath17 , for @xmath18 , is the probability that the addition of the @xmath19st edge to @xmath8 incorporates @xmath20 new nodes into @xmath13 .",
    "these three probabilities can be assessed easily as fractions of @xmath21 and lead to a simplification of ( [ diffeq ] ) as @xmath22 which is clearly solved by @xmath23 furthermore , for @xmath24 we obtain @xmath25 so @xmath14 obviously decreases rapidly with @xmath6 .",
    "we now turn to our two main sections . at the end , concluding remarks are given in section  [ concl ] .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the chromatic number of @xmath1 .",
    "we show in figure  [ trick ] two plots for @xmath27 , one indicating the time needed to find @xmath28 by a public - domain code @xcite that is based on the heuristic of @xcite , the other indicating the evolution of @xmath28 as @xmath6 is increased .",
    "we only show data for a certain range of @xmath6 values , since coloring instances outside this interval tend to be relatively trivial , thus requiring little time for solution .",
    "as expected , the chromatic number increases steadily as the graph gets denser ( acquires more edges ) , and does so increasingly rapidly . also , it is often the case that the time needed to find the chromatic number goes down significantly immediately after each increase in the chromatic number . in this section ,",
    "we develop new combinatorial arguments that show that such sudden transitions are indeed to be expected .",
    "[ trick ]    our study of the hardness of finding @xmath26 starts with an investigation of how abundant optimal colorings of @xmath1 are , that is , colorings that require exactly @xmath26 colors . in order to carry out this investigation , we resort to the chromatic polynomial of @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath29 , which gives the number of distinct ways in which @xmath1 can be colored by at most @xmath30 colors .",
    "this polynomial has several interesting properties .",
    "for example , it is a degree-@xmath2 polynomial in @xmath31 , the coefficient of @xmath32 is @xmath33 , and the coefficient of @xmath34 is @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "also , by definition @xmath26 is the least value of @xmath31 for which @xmath29 is positive , giving the number of distinct ways in which @xmath1 can be colored optimally .",
    "so finding @xmath29 is expected to be no easier than finding @xmath26 , although the following simple method can be used for relatively small graphs .",
    "let @xmath36 be any edge of @xmath1 , denote by @xmath37 the graph obtained from @xmath1 by removing @xmath36 , and by @xmath38 the graph obtained from @xmath1 by contracting the end nodes of @xmath36 into one single node .",
    "we see that @xmath1 can be colored in as many distinct ways as @xmath37 can , except for those colorings of @xmath37 that assign to the end nodes of @xmath36 the same color .",
    "but these are precisely the colorings of @xmath38 , so we get @xmath39 clearly , ( [ recursion1 ] ) defines a simple recursion for calculating @xmath29 that stops either at graphs that only contain isolated nodes or at graphs that are completely connected . if @xmath20 is the number of nodes in either case , then the former graphs admit @xmath40 distinct colorings and the latter @xmath41 distinct colorings , so the polynomial can be calculated easily at the bases of the recursion and upward from them .    in figure  [ poly10 ] ,",
    "three plots are given for @xmath42 : one depicts the continual increase of the chromatic number as the number of edges is increased , while another shows the number of distinct optimal colorings for each graph @xmath13 , that is , @xmath43 ( the third plot is discussed shortly in what follows ) . for each graph ,",
    "the chromatic polynomial has been computed using public - domain code @xcite based on the recursion of ( [ recursion1 ] ) .",
    "this computation quickly exhausts processing and memory resources as the numbers of nodes and edges increase  thence the reason why we present data for @xmath42 only .",
    "so we must always bear in mind that our ability to draw general conclusions may be impaired .",
    "[ poly10 ]    as the plots of figure  [ poly10 ] indicate , the number of distinct optimal colorings increases dramatically at each step in the chromatic number , and after that decreases more or less steadily until immediately before the next step . in absolute terms , then , at each increase in the chromatic number optimal colorings become strictly more abundant . if the same could be shown to hold in relative terms as well ( i.e. , if the fraction of optimal colorings relative to some larger universe could be shown to undergo the same transition ) , then we might be able to continue and investigate in more detail how this relates to the time it takes to color the graphs optimally . however , we find that it is as yet unclear how to characterize such a larger universe .",
    "even so , it is worth examining the matter further , because at least in part the sudden jumps in the number of optimal colorings are really the product of well understood combinatorial growth at work .",
    "for example , let us examine what happens when the chromatic number increases from @xmath20 to @xmath44 along the sequence of graphs .",
    "suppose nodes @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the nodes that , when connected to each other by an edge , cause the graph s chromatic number to increase",
    ". clearly , each optimal coloring before the increase ( i.e. , with @xmath20 colors ) yields at least @xmath44 distinct optimal colorings after the increase ( i.e. , with @xmath44 colors ) : viewing colors as positive integers , first choose one of @xmath45 or @xmath46 and assign to it color @xmath44 , while the remaining nodes all retain their previous colors ; then assign color @xmath44 to all nodes that had color @xmath20 and this color to the one of @xmath45 or @xmath46 that was selected previously ; then proceed likewise until this same node has been assigned all colors ( @xmath44 down through @xmath33 ) .    while this may all seem like obvious combinatorial growth at the points where the chromatic number changes",
    ", we remark that such an effect may also be present in the behavior of the backbones commonly used to characterize the phase transitions of graph coloring . in the setting that we just examined",
    ", nodes @xmath45 and @xmath46 clearly constitute one of the node pairs of the backbone  or else the addition of an edge between them would not cause the chromatic number to increase , because there would be at least one optimal coloring with @xmath20 colors that would assign different colors to them .",
    "so let us consider the probability that randomly chosen nodes @xmath45 and @xmath46 constitute a backbone pair .",
    "we do so by first conceding , just for the sake of the argument , that nodes are uniformly distributed among the colors in all optimal colorings . in this case , the probability that @xmath45 and @xmath46 have the same color in all optimal colorings ( that is , that @xmath45 and @xmath46 form a backbone pair ) when the chromatic number is @xmath20 is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the number of optimal colorings with @xmath20 colors .",
    "but @xmath48 increases to at least @xmath49 when the chromatic number increases to @xmath44 , so the probability we just computed gets divided by at least @xmath50 .",
    "we then see that the sudden increases observed in the number of optimal colorings are probably also inherently related to what happens to backbones at the same points in the sequence of graphs .",
    "this provides a new perspective on the collapse of backbones at the coloring transitions while at the same time providing a better understanding of why it happens .",
    "another well understood combinatorial - growth effect is that , when the chromatic number is @xmath20 , every optimal coloring is essentially equivalent to @xmath51 others , each corresponding to a permutation of the colors among the nodes .",
    "this brings us to the third plot of figure  [ poly10 ] , where the number of optimal colorings is shown normalized by the factorial of the current chromatic number .",
    "evidently , all sudden jumps are still there , but they now possess a stronger significance , because only one optimal coloring is counted out of all colorings that are equivalent to one another by straightforward permutation of colors ( that is , without implying a different partition of the node set ) .    but let us return to the chromatic polynomial of @xmath1 .",
    "the usefulness of this polynomial goes beyond the counting of distinct colorings , as it provides the first link to yet another characterization of the hardness of optimal graph coloring , now based on the acyclic orientations of @xmath1 .",
    "an orientation of @xmath1 is an assignment of directions to the edges of @xmath1 ; it is acyclic if no directed cycles are formed , that is , if it is impossible to reach the same node twice by following edges according to their directions exclusively .",
    "if we let the set of the acyclic orientations of @xmath1 be denoted by @xmath52 and consider the number of acyclic orientations of @xmath1 in terms of what happens to the graphs @xmath37 and @xmath38 introduced earlier , then we have the following .",
    "every acyclic orientation of @xmath37 yields either one or two acyclic orientations for @xmath1 when @xmath36 is assigned a direction .",
    "the former case happens when one direction assignment for @xmath36 forms a directed cycle in @xmath1 but not the other , the latter when both assignments preserve acyclicity in @xmath1 ( it can not happen that both assignments form directed cycles because the orientation of @xmath37 is acyclic ) . similarly , every acyclic orientation of @xmath38 is necessarily one of those acyclic orientations of @xmath37 from which two orientations of @xmath1 are obtained .",
    "thus , @xmath53 for any edge @xmath36 of @xmath1 .",
    "the recursion in ( [ recursion2 ] ) is strikingly similar to the one in ( [ recursion1 ] ) , and this has been shown to give rise to the remarkable identity @xmath54 that is , the number of acyclic orientations of @xmath1 can be obtained from applying the chromatic polynomial of @xmath1 to the negative unit @xcite .",
    "obtaining ( [ nacyclic ] ) and some of its refinements @xcite from the relation between ( [ recursion1 ] ) and ( [ recursion2 ] ) comes as a consequence of the so - called theory of p - partitions and its order polynomials @xcite . of interest to us",
    "is that such polynomials quantify the following very useful relationship between the acyclic orientations of @xmath1 and its colorings .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 can be colored by @xmath20 colors .",
    "still viewing colors as positive integers , suppose also that we assign to the edges of @xmath1 an orientation that makes every edge point from the node with the higher color to the one with the lower .",
    "this orientation is clearly acyclic and induces no directed path in @xmath1 containing more than @xmath20 nodes .",
    "conversely , suppose we start from an acyclic orientation of @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath20 is the number of nodes on the longest directed path in @xmath1 according to this orientation , then @xmath1 can be colored by at most @xmath20 colors , as follows .",
    "we assign color @xmath33 to the sinks ( nodes whose adjacent edges are all oriented inward ) , then color @xmath55 to the sinks that would be formed if the original sinks were to be removed from @xmath1 , then the lowest available color to the set of sinks that would appear next , and so on .    note , in this process , that starting with a coloring yields a unique acyclic orientation .",
    "the converse is not necessarily true , however : starting with an acyclic orientation may yield more than one coloring of the nodes of @xmath1 .",
    "consider , for example , the acyclic orientation shown in figure  [ 1orient2colorings ] and the two corresponding colorings shown in parentheses next to the nodes .",
    "what the process indicates , however , is that it is possible to seek optimal colorings for @xmath1 by looking for acyclic orientations of @xmath1 that are shortest in terms of how many nodes there are in a longest directed path .",
    "letting @xmath56 be the set of such orientations , what we have seen is that @xmath57 so we may have a tighter characterization of how abundant optimal colorings are by looking at shortest acyclic orientations instead of the chromatic polynomial applied to @xmath26 .",
    "[ 1orient2colorings ]    the formal relationship between @xmath26 and the acyclic orientations of @xmath1 can be stated as follows @xcite , and strengthens important earlier results @xcite .",
    "for @xmath58 , let @xmath59 be the set of all directed paths in @xmath1 according to @xmath60 . for @xmath61 , let @xmath62 indicate the number of nodes in @xmath63 . then @xmath64    an illustration is given in figure  [ length ] , where two acyclic orientations are shown for the same graph , together with the corresponding partition into sinks alluded to earlier .",
    "this partition is known as the sink decomposition of the graph according to the acyclic orientation @xcite . in the figure",
    ", each such decomposition is shown with a rightmost box containing the sinks , then another box to its left containing the sinks that appear if the former sinks are eliminated , and so on .",
    "the set of nodes in each box is normally referred to as a layer of the sink decomposition .",
    "notice that the number of layers in the sink decomposition for @xmath60 is precisely @xmath65 . in the case of figure  [ length ] ,",
    "the bottommost acyclic orientation has the smaller sink decomposition and thus corresponds to a better ( in this case , optimal ) assignment of colors ( a different color to the nodes in each layer ) .",
    "+    [ length ]    for @xmath42 , figure  [ shortest10 ] depicts the relationship between the chromatic number and the number of acyclic orientations of each graph in @xmath12 .",
    "the thinner dashed plot in the figure gives the number of acyclic orientations of each graph .",
    "this number has been computed using the algorithm of @xcite , which although efficient in several aspects relevant to the analysis of enumerative algorithms , becomes prohibitive very quickly as the graph gets larger .",
    "the same enumeration process has been used to record the number of acyclic orientations that are shortest , that is , those whose sink decompositions have as many layers as the graph s chromatic number .",
    "this small addition to the algorithm employs straightforward depth - first search @xcite , and the results are shown as the thicker solid plot of the figure .",
    "[ shortest10 ]    remarkably , an effect very similar to the one observed in figure  [ poly10 ] is seen to occur now as well : the number of shortest acyclic orientations increases sharply whenever the chromatic number increases , and subsequently goes down until immediately before the next increase .",
    "these are also absolute data , but now it is obvious how to make them relative : we simply observe the percentage of all acyclic orientations that are shortest .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ compcolor10 ] , which confirms that , also in relative terms , shortest acyclic orientations become significantly more abundant right after an increase in the chromatic number , becoming increasingly rarer from there onward until the next increase .",
    "[ compcolor10 ]    this indicates that , in a sense , coloring a graph optimally becomes easier immediately after an increase in the chromatic number , and incrementally harder until the next transition is reached . behind this statement",
    "is the intuitive feeling that coloring algorithms should in general fare better when optimal solutions are more abundant , be such abundance assessed as some indicator of how many optimal colorings there are or as the fraction @xmath66 of shortest acyclic orientations .",
    "of course , this intuition calls for experimental support , but notice that at least the most nave of all random approaches  a series of bernoulli trials inside @xmath52 until the first member of @xmath67 is found  is certain to benefit from such abundance of shortest acyclic orientations , as clearly the expected time for its convergence is @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "more serious methods with the potential to benefit from the relative abundance of optimal acyclic orientations exist @xcite , though , and a systematic effort to assess their capabilities on sequences of random graphs is under way .    the number ( or fraction ) of optimal acyclic orientations is , in principle , also subject to the same concerns with the disguising action of obvious combinatorial growth that we expressed earlier . to see what happens when we apply the same normalization by the factorial of the current chromatic number , we have in each of figures  [ shortest10 ] and [ compcolor10 ] a plot with the results ( the one in thick dashes ) .",
    "the pronounced jumps are still present , but this normalization is only meaningful as inherited from the relationship between optimal colorings and shortest acyclic orientations .    a better normalization may exist and we would like to digress on this possibility briefly , although several problems related to it are still open .",
    "suppose we take an acyclic orientation and turn all its sinks into sources ( nodes whose adjacent edges are all oriented outward ) .",
    "this necessarily yields another acyclic orientation , and the continual repetition of the process must eventually lead to a period of orientations .",
    "this attractor dynamics has several interesting properties @xcite ; in our context , the most crucial property is that the number of layers in the graph s sink decomposition is continually nonincreasing along the process of obtaining new acyclic orientations by turning sinks into sources .",
    "so the period at the core of each attractor comprises orientations that yield sink decompositions all with the same number of layers , this number being also no larger than that resulting from any other orientation in the same attractor .",
    "this means that , in addition to the chromatic indicator originally observed when this attractor dynamics was first analyzed ( the graph s interleaved multichromatic number , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , each attractor is related to finding the chromatic number as well , since finding a period whose orientations are shortest over all attractors immediately yields the chromatic number . a period , in summary , provides a means of expressing the equivalence of several acyclic orientations and may become suitable for the normalization we need if only more knowledge can be obtained on it .",
    "unfortunately , we thus far lack this necessary additional knowledge .",
    "to finalize , we comment on yet another interesting insight that can be gained from considering the relationship between a graph s colorings and its acyclic orientations .",
    "suppose that @xmath60 is an acyclic orientation of @xmath1 , and consider the random addition of an edge to @xmath1 between two nodes not currently connected .",
    "if we look at @xmath60 from the perspective of its sink decomposition , then let its layers be numbered @xmath33 through @xmath69 , starting at the layer that contains the sinks and onward . as illustrated in figure  [ morelayers ] , in some cases the addition of the new edge will preserve the sink decomposition , while in others it will not .",
    "these two possibilities are shown in the leftmost sink decomposition in the figure as two dashed directed edges .",
    "the addition of one of them preserves the sink decomposition ( shown in the middle sink decomposition of the figure ) ; the addition of the other , which connects two nodes in the same layer , forces the sink decomposition to acquire another layer , as shown in the rightmost sink decomposition of the figure .",
    "[ morelayers ]    let us then assume that , if the new edge is added between layers , then it is oriented in the direction of the lower - numbered layer . let also the @xmath70th layer have @xmath71 nodes , so that @xmath72 .",
    "the number of node pairs not yet connected by an edge is @xmath73 ; of these , the ones that have nodes in different layers amount to @xmath74 .",
    "if we let @xmath75 be the probability that adding the new edge does not disturb the sink decomposition , then @xmath75 is the probability that the edge is added between layers .",
    "that is , @xmath76    by ( [ prob ] ) , the addition of an edge between layers ( this happens with probability @xmath75 ) causes @xmath75 to decrease , as the only change in the formula is the concomitant subtraction of @xmath33 off both the numerator and the denominator . when the edge is added between nodes of the same layer ( with probability @xmath77 ) , the double summation in the numerator of ( [ prob ] ) may either remain the same or vary . if it remains the same or decreases , then @xmath75 , as before , decreases . in order to verify what happens otherwise ,",
    "let @xmath78 denote the double summation .",
    "then @xmath75 is seen to vary by at least @xmath79 so @xmath75 increases unless @xmath80 , in which case it was zero to begin with and remains zero .",
    "if we now consider the number of edges that need to be randomly added to @xmath1 so that @xmath75 once again assumes the value it currently has , say @xmath81 , it is easy to see from ( [ prob ] ) that this number is given by @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the increase that @xmath75 incurs along the way .",
    "the value of @xmath83 is very hard to quantify , but it seems reasonable to assume , at least for the sake of the argument , that it gets smaller as the graph gets denser ( i.e. , acquires more edges ) . in this case , the number of random edge additions needed for @xmath75 to return to the value @xmath81 is ever smaller as the process unfolds .",
    "overall , what we witness is a process that resembles the increase in @xmath26 as @xmath1 becomes denser , slow at first but increasingly rapid as the graph s density gets higher .",
    "we hope to obtain a better characterization of this resemblance as further research adds detail to the picture .",
    "if we succeed , it may be possible to obtain a generic prescription for determining all the points at which the chromatic number increases along the sequence , thus adding to what is already known @xcite .",
    "let @xmath84 denote the independence number of @xmath1 . we have used public - domain code @xcite based on @xcite to find @xmath85 for each graph in @xmath12 with @xmath86 .",
    "what this code finds is not a maximum independent set directly , but rather a maximum clique in the graph that is complementary to the graph of interest ( i.e. , has an edge joining two distinct nodes if and only if the graph of interest does not ) .",
    "a clique is a subgraph whose nodes are all connected to one another , so the correspondence to independent sets should be clear .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ maxclique ] .",
    "[ maxclique ]    figure  [ dfmax ] has two plots for @xmath86 , one to indicate the time to find the graph s independence number , the other to indicate how this number evolves as the graph becomes denser .",
    "we show data for a certain density interval only . to the left of what is shown the graphs have isolated nodes and",
    "the behavior is uncharacteristic , while to the right times become too small to be indicative of any particularly interesting behavior .",
    "but inside the density interval used in the figure the independence number goes down nearly steadily , from @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 can only be explained by the existence of two last isolated nodes in @xmath90 , one of which gets incorporated into @xmath91 , the other into @xmath92 . that a node should remain isolated through @xmath93 for @xmath86",
    "is unlikely but entirely conceivable .",
    "in fact , the probability of such an event , given approximately by @xmath94 ( cf .",
    "( [ isolated ] ) ) , is @xmath95 . ] and at some of these downward transitions there appears to be a considerable decrease in the time for optimal solution right after the decrease in the independence number .",
    "although this evidence is less ubiquitous than in the case of graph coloring , and for this reason certainly less compelling , this study seems to be the first one to address the issue of phase transitions related to finding a graph s independence number and for this reason we investigate the matter further . in this section",
    ", we introduce some combinatorial arguments that appear to relate to these phenomena .",
    "[ dfmax ]    as for graph coloring , our initial step is to assess the abundance of maximum independent sets for a given graph @xmath1 , that is , independent sets of size @xmath84 . unlike the case of graph coloring , however , it is as yet unknown how to count this number exactly .",
    "this remains true even if we settle for maximal ( as opposed to maximum ) independent sets , that is , independent sets that can not be enlarged without losing the independence property , although in this case increasingly better upper bounds on the desired number have been discovered recently ( cf .  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "but at this point it helps to recall that the sequence of graphs @xmath11 is randomly generated , each graph being drawn uniformly from the set of graphs having the same number of nodes and edges . we may therefore attempt to assess the number of maximal independent sets of a given size in each graph by computing the expected value of this number , which is in fact a random quantity . in order to accomplish this more easily , it is helpful to resort to the model of random graphs in which an edge exists between two nodes with constant probability , say @xmath63 , independently of the nodes .",
    "although this is not the model under which our graphs were generated , away from limiting situations it is safe to assume that the two models are equivalent to each other with @xmath96 for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath97 denote the expected number of maximal independent sets of size @xmath20 in @xmath1 .",
    "the number of candidate sets is @xmath98 , and the probability that each one is an independent set is @xmath99 .",
    "if a candidate is an independent set , then the probability that it is maximal is the probability that each of the remaining @xmath100 nodes is connected to at least one of its @xmath20 nodes , that is , @xmath101^{n - k}$ ] .",
    "we then get @xmath102^{n - k}.\\ ] ] now let @xmath1 be a random graph generated in compliance with the edge density given by @xmath63 , and let the value of @xmath84 be known . letting @xmath103 in ( [ expectedmis ] ) yields the expected number of maximal independent sets in similar random graphs , whose size is , at least for one of them , the size of its maximum independent set .",
    "[ expected75 ]    for @xmath86 , we show the evolution of this number for the sequence @xmath12 in figure  [ expected75 ] , along with the evolution of the independence number .",
    "interestingly , every transition of the independence number to a smaller value causes the expected number of maximal independent sets of size @xmath85 to increase markedly .",
    "from there onward , this number decreases until the next similar transition occurs .",
    "this is one first indication , albeit imprecise , that the abundance of such maximal sets may be related to the increased ease with which the graph s independence number can sometimes be found immediately after a decrease in the independence number .",
    "however , as in our analysis of the chromatic polynomial in section  [ coloring ] , it is not clear how to proceed and characterize the relationship more effectively .",
    "not only this , but it is still possible , as in the case of graph coloring , that some underlying inherent equivalence among maximal independent sets exists that would indicate a way of normalizing the data shown in the figure . we still do not know how that can be achieved .    once again , though , a deep relationship exists between a graph s independent sets and its acyclic orientations .",
    "it is in this case both more complex and more subtle than in the case of graph coloring , so we describe it with the aid of an illustration right from the start",
    ". first consider figure  [ width ] , where two acyclic orientations of the same graph are shown , each one alongside what is known as a chain decomposition of the graph according to it .",
    "a chain decomposition of a graph according to an acyclic orientation is a partition of the graph s node set such that the nodes in each set of the partition are arranged by the acyclic orientation as a single chain of nodes ( a directed path ) . in the case of figure",
    "[ width ] , each partition is displayed with the aid of boxes to enclose the nodes that go in each set .",
    "furthermore , each of the chain decompositions shown in the figure employs the minimum number of chains for the corresponding acyclic orientation .",
    "the topmost acyclic orientation admits a chain decomposition comprising one single chain , while for the other no chain decomposition exists with fewer than two chains .",
    "+    [ width ]    understanding how chain decompositions and independent sets are related involves several technicalities that we will not discuss formally but illustrate through examples instead .",
    "figure  [ flow ] contains two flow networks , that is , two directed graphs with two distinguished nodes , @xmath6 and @xmath104 , on which we consider the maximum flow from @xmath6 to @xmath104 subject to certain edge capacities ( unit for all edges that emanate from @xmath6 or arrive at @xmath104 , infinite for all others ) .",
    "each flow network corresponds to one of the acyclic orientations of figure  [ width ] and is constructed from that orientation as follows . for each node @xmath45 in @xmath1 , two nodes , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ,",
    "are added to the flow network , along with a directed edge from @xmath6 to @xmath105 and one from @xmath106 to @xmath104 .",
    "if an edge exists between nodes @xmath45 and @xmath46 and the acyclic orientation directs that edge from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , then the flow network contains an edge directed from @xmath105 to @xmath107 .",
    "+    [ flow ]    the maximum flow from @xmath6 to @xmath104 in each of the networks of figure  [ flow ] is indicated by solid edges ( edges that carry unit flow ) and dashed edges ( edges that carry zero flow ) . in general , the following interesting property holds for maximum flows in such networks @xcite . of the solid edges , those whose removal disconnects @xmath6 from @xmath104 minimally ( the minimum cut )",
    "induce a node cover in @xmath1 , that is , a set of nodes that touches every edge . in figure",
    "[ flow ] , an edge in the minimum cut either leads from @xmath6 to a node enclosed in a box or from such a node to @xmath104 .",
    "nodes thus represented correspond to the node sets @xmath108 and @xmath109 in @xmath1 , each set a node cover .",
    "note that , by definition , the complements of these sets with respect to the node set of @xmath1 are necessarily independent sets of @xmath1in the figure , these are the sets @xmath110 and @xmath111 , each of whose nodes corresponds to one of the chains in figure  [ width ] .    formally , the relationship between @xmath84 and the acyclic orientations of @xmath1 is as given next @xcite , and brings sharper focus to the classic result established by dilworth s theorem @xcite . for @xmath58 ,",
    "let @xmath112 be the set of all chain decompositions of @xmath1 according to @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath113 , let @xmath114 be the number of chains in @xmath115 .",
    "then @xmath116 as one readily notices , ( [ alphafromomega ] ) is a sort of dual of ( [ chifromomega ] ) : it expresses @xmath84 as the number of chains in the minimum chain decomposition that has the most chains over @xmath52 .",
    "henceforth , we let @xmath117 denote the set of such widest acyclic orientations , understood as those acyclic orientations that achieve the minimum chain decomposition that is maximum over @xmath52 .    it is now instructive to return briefly to figure  [ width ] . for each acyclic orientation @xmath60 displayed in the figure ,",
    "the number of chains in the corresponding chain decomposition is @xmath118 .",
    "of the two acyclic orientations , the bottommost achieves the maximum of this quantity over @xmath52 .",
    "we now investigate the use of @xmath119 as an indicator of how abundant the widest acyclic orientations of @xmath1 are and how this relates to the hardness of finding @xmath84 . this time ,",
    "our procedure to enumerate all the acyclic orientations of a graph has been coupled with a public - domain code @xcite that implements the algorithm of @xcite to find the maximum flow in a network ( and also the minimum cut , as a by - product ) .",
    "[ widest10 ]    the results are shown in figure  [ widest10 ] , in which the number of all acyclic orientations of each graph is plotted alongside its independence number and the number of acyclic orientations that are widest ( those whose chain decomposition into the fewest possible chains requires @xmath85 chains ) .",
    "the figure indicates that the same sharp transitions that appear in figure  [ expected75 ] are also observed for the acyclic orientations : every downward transition that the independence number undergoes is accompanied by a sharp increase in the number of widest acyclic orientations .",
    "when we assess such increases with respect to the set of all the acyclic orientations of each graph , we obtain what is shown in figure  [ compmis10 ] .",
    "clearly , every decrease in the independence number corresponds to a marked increase in the fraction of acyclic orientations that are widest .",
    "we hope to eventually be able to conclude that such increases are correlated with the time it takes to find a graph s maximum independent set . as we mentioned in section  [ coloring ]",
    ", obviously the unreasonable approach of random trials does benefit from an elevated @xmath120 ratio , but we believe this may also be the case for heuristics that exploit the role of acyclic orientations directly @xcite .    [ compmis10 ]",
    "we have investigated the np - hard problems of coloring the nodes of a graph optimally and of finding a maximum independent set in a graph . for each of these problems",
    ", we first displayed empirical evidence that , as the number of edges in the graph is increased by the random addition of one edge at a time , significant variations take place in the time to solve the problem optimally . often these variations coincide with the transition of the value of the optimal solution to a new level , a higher one for graph coloring , a lower one for independent sets .    for graph coloring",
    ", we have shown that the upward transitions in the chromatic number along the sequence of increasingly denser graphs coincide with sharp increases in the abundance of distinct colorings employing the optimal number of colors .",
    "more importantly , we have shown that the same phenomenon takes place when we consider the shortest acyclic orientations of the graphs , that is , those orientations whose sink decompositions have as many layers as the graphs chromatic numbers . in this case , sharp increases are observed in the ratio @xmath121 .",
    "our conclusions for the maximum independent set problem are similar .",
    "the downward transitions in the independence number that occur along the sequence of graphs coincide with sharp increases in the expected number of maximal independent sets of certain sizes . as for the acyclic orientations of the graphs ,",
    "we have given evidence that the same type of phenomenon takes place regarding the widest acyclic orientations of the graphs , that is , those whose minimum chain decompositions have as many chains as the graphs independence numbers .",
    "in this case , sharp increases take place in the ratio @xmath122 .",
    "we find that the two special subsets of @xmath52 , @xmath67 and @xmath123 , underlie an interpretation of the phase transitions observed in optimal graph coloring and optimal independent sets that is full of combinatorial meaning .",
    "this meaning is directly related to the structure of the graphs involved and that of its acyclic orientations .",
    "in addition , it provides a direct interpretation of the hardness of the problems as given by the relative abundance of the acyclic orientations that give the optima .    except for those shown in figures  [ trick ] , [ dfmax ] , and [ expected75 ] ,",
    "all our empirical results have been given for @xmath42 only . as we indicated earlier",
    ", the reason for this has been the severe combinatorial explosion that occurs when finding a graph s chromatic polynomial or its set of acyclic orientations . for @xmath124 , so far these computations could only be carried out through about @xmath125 edges , yielding results that fully support the conclusions we have drawn along the paper .",
    "but , instead of presenting such partial results , we opted for giving the reader data on the full evolution through the densest graphs for @xmath42 .",
    "we think the empirical evidence we have provided is only the beginning of a deeper investigation of how the abundance of certain acyclic orientations affects the hardness of optimal graph coloring and of finding maximum independent sets .",
    "given the aforementioned computational difficulties , the most promising avenue for continuation seems to be the search for additional analytic properties that can explain the findings we have described .",
    "perhaps the evolution of the probability in ( [ prob ] ) superficially described at the end of section  [ coloring ] , and of an analogous indicator in the case of independent sets , should be investigated more deeply as a first step ."
