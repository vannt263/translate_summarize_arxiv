    "the large mass of the top quark implies that its weak decay time is much shorter than the typical time for the strong interactions to affect its spin @xcite . within the standard model ,",
    "the dominant decay chain of the top quark is @xmath8 .",
    "the angular distribution of the top decay given below is a simple expression to clarify the correlations between the top quark decay products and the top spin : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is defined as the angle between top quark decay products and top quark spin quantization axis in the rest frame of the top quark . for @xmath11 or @xmath12 the correlation coeficient @xmath13 which leads to the strongest correlation .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the study of the single production of top quark will give a useful tool to understand the standard model mechanism for electroweak symmetry and coupling of the top quark to other particles .",
    "there are many detailed discussions in the literature for the single top production and spin correlations in @xmath7 and @xmath14 collisions @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to describe polarization of the top quarks along the direction of various spin bases for the single production in @xmath1 collision via @xmath4 and @xmath5 processes .",
    "it is hoped that the linear @xmath15 collider can be converted into an @xmath1 collider as an additional option when linear collider is constructed on the same base as the proton ring .",
    "linear collider design tesla at desy is the one which has this option called tesla+herap @xmath1 collider @xcite .",
    "similar option would be considered for clic+lhc at cern .",
    "we will take into account the estimations about the energy and luminosity of these colliders as @xmath16 tev ( @xmath17 gev ) , @xmath18 @xmath19 for tesla+herap and @xmath20 tev ( @xmath21 gev ) , @xmath22 @xmath19 for clic+lhc .    at @xmath23 colliders",
    "top quark decay products occur in both the @xmath24 and the single @xmath25 production modes . in the case of pair production , there is potentially observable angular correlations among the decay products arising from the fact that spin up top quark is more likely to be produced along with a spin down top antiquark .",
    "the size of these 2-particle correlations tends to be smaller in @xmath26 collisions than in @xmath27 collisons . because the dominant contribution to top quark pair production is due to the @xmath26 initial state , the predicted 2-particle correlations are rather small @xcite .",
    "the single top quark production has the electroweak process with produced top quarks couples to a @xmath28 boson .",
    "that is why we expect strong spin polarization of top quarks . but",
    "single top decay products in the final states give smaller statistics when compared to pair production .",
    "therefore , a sophisticated signal analysis needs to be performed at @xmath23 colliders .    in @xmath1 collision top quark decay products in the final states",
    "are dominated by the single @xmath25 production due to absence of the @xmath24 production .",
    "this is a great advantage that the single top production is a result of primarily electroweak process .",
    "therefore , it is anticipated that the @xmath1 colliders with linear electron ( or positron ) beams are appropriate choice for investigating top quark spin polarization .",
    "the calculation of single top quark production cross section is based on the @xmath0 fusion process with @xmath29 diagram .",
    "these diagrams are dominated by the configuration where the final state @xmath30 quark is nearly collinear with the incoming gluon .",
    "if b quark mass is neglected the cross section becomes singular .",
    "furthermore , at each order in the strong coupling , there are logarithmically enhanced contributions , converting the perturbation expansion from a series in @xmath31 to one in @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 is the virtuality of the @xmath28 boson .",
    "the slow convergence of this original perturbation expansion caused by the large logarithms can be absorbed into the b quark distribution function by resumming the terms to all orders . once the b quark parton distribution function has been introduced @xcite",
    ", one should begin with @xmath35 process such as @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath36 process still can be included as a correction to the @xmath35 process . because the logarithmic part of the @xmath36 process is already covered by b quark parton distribution function used to compute @xmath35 process",
    ", it is necessary to subtract the overlap region of these two diagrams to avoid double counting@xcite .",
    "so , combined cross section becomes    @xmath37\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the subtracted term is the gluon splitting piece of the cross section for @xmath38 .    for the main process @xmath4 spin dependent squared amplitude",
    "is given by    @xmath39\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where momentum of the each particle is represented by its symbol .",
    "the momentum transfer q and top quark spin vector are defined by @xmath40 with r.s .",
    "stands for rest system of the top quark .    in the case of @xmath35 process",
    "we will show that , the top quark spin is completely polarized along the positron beam direction ( spin up ) in top rest frame . the definition of the spin axis in the rest frame of the top quark does not depend on the coordinate system where the cross section is performed .",
    "so it is more convenient to calculate cross section in the center of mass system of incoming positron and b quark .",
    "the momentum definitions of incoming and outgoing fermions are @xmath41    here mandelstam variable @xmath42 belongs to subprocess of @xmath43 scattering .",
    "top quark energy @xmath44 and momentum @xmath45 can be written in terms of @xmath42 and top mass @xmath46    @xmath47    let us define top spin direction along the positron beam as follows @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the positron momentum observed in the rest frame of the top quark . since positron momentum @xmath50 is first defined in cm system where the cross section is calculated , one should apply lorentz boost to the rest frame of the top quark with the expression below    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the velocity of the top quark in the cm system and @xmath53 can be written in terms of @xmath42 and @xmath46    @xmath54    using the above expressions we obtain scalar products of four vectors @xmath55 and @xmath56 inside the square bracket of the squared amplitude    @xmath57 \\\\",
    "p_{e}\\cdot s_{t}=-\\frac{\\lambda}{4 m_{t}}[(s - m_{t}^{2 } )   \\cos{\\theta } + s+m_{t}^{2}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when these results are put into the squared amplitude of process @xmath4 it is clear that the amplitude gives zero for @xmath58 ( spin down ) .",
    "therefore top spin is 100% polarized when the spin direction is chosen along the incoming e - beam ( spin up ) in the top quark rest frame .    for the correction to @xmath35 process @xmath0 fusion process @xmath5 we write the amplitude as a sum of the contribution from each diagram :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 correspond diagrams with @xmath63 quark exchange , @xmath64 quark exchange and their interference , respectively .",
    "reduced amplitudes @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are    @xmath68    @xmath69    @xmath70    @xmath71    gluon splitting part of the cross section that we should subtract can be written as follows    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the probability for a gluon to split into @xmath74 pair at leading order    @xmath75    with splitting function    @xmath76.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in splitting procedure the same qcd factorization scale should be considered as the one used in the parton distribution functions .",
    "all of the cross sections presented in this paper have been computed using mrst2002 parton distribution functions @xcite and running @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "considering combination , we obtain unpolarized total cross section of single top quark production 3.2 pb at tesla+herap and 32.5 pb at clic+lhc .",
    "let us now discuss the spin of the top quarks produced with @xmath4 process ( @xmath35 contribution ) at tesla+herap and clic+lhc energies @xmath2 and 5.3 tev .",
    "in the zero momentum frame(zmf ) of the initial state partons t quark and antineutrino go out back to back .",
    "since they couple to a @xmath28 boson , in the initial state b quarke has left handed chirality and positron right handed chirality .",
    "their chiralities imply left and right handed helicities due to their high speed .",
    "because of the angular momentum conservation outgoing t quark has both left and right handed helicity component . in this frame , it is shown from table  [ tab1 ] and table  [ tab2 ] that t quark is left handed 95% and 97% of the time for tesla+herap and clic+lhc , respectively .",
    "helicity of the particle with large mass is highly frame dependent because the speed of t quark is not ultrarelativistic at the energy region of @xmath1 colliders .",
    "so , in the laboratory frame of tesla+herap and clic+lhc it is right handed 80% and 62% of the time .    in the case of @xmath5 process ( @xmath36 ) additional third particle in the final state shares the momentum ,",
    "then the fraction of left handed helicity component decreases in the zmf which is left handed only 76%(77% ) of the time at tesla+herap ( clic+lhc ) energies .",
    "it is right handed 77% and 62% of the time in the laboratory(lab ) frame of tesla+herap and clic+lhc .",
    "it should be pointed out that the overlap region needs an extra discussion .",
    "there are two possibilities to define zmf which are in terms of either @xmath77 or @xmath43 initial states . as explained above helicity of the top quark",
    "is not invariant under longitudinal boosts connecting these two frames .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to define zmf uniqely .",
    "a further discussion concerning its experimental side can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath7 collision .    for a spin basis",
    "whose definition does not depend on the existence of a zmf , we would think of antineutrino direction as the decomposition axis of the top quark spin in theoretical point of view . since the spin direction is defined in the rest frame of the top quark ,",
    "choosing antineutrino axis is almost equivalent to observing the helicity of the t quark in the frame where antineutrino and t quark are back to back for @xmath35 process . in this case",
    "we obtain spin up contribution with 95% of the time which has the same degree of polarization as the zmf helicity basis for tesla+herap . at clic+lhc energy , fractions with",
    "left handed helicity in zmf and with spin up in antineutrino direction are both 97% . in the @xmath36 case 90% of top quarks are produced with spin up in this basis for tesla+herap and 89% for clic+lhc .",
    "combination of @xmath35 and @xmath36 processes with subtraction gives 92%(91% ) fraction of spin up quarks at tesla+herap ( clic+lhc ) energy . in experimental point of view",
    ", the antineutrino is invisible and we need somthing visible to make the basis definition .",
    "fortunately , such an alternate definition is possible .",
    "the outgoing antineutrino is only slightly deflected from the incoming positron direction in @xmath35 or @xmath36 process , and so it is interesting to consider @xmath78 line to define the spin basis .",
    "then we find overall fraction of the spin up top quarks as 96% which is close to the one in the antineutrino axis at tesla+herap collider .",
    "this becomes 93% at clic+lhc collider . in tables , we have kept results from the antineutrino direction for theoretical motivation . from the rest frame of the top quark e - beam and p - beam are not back to back .",
    "then , it is also interesting to discuss the proton - beam ( p - beam ) as a spin decomposition axis for comparison .",
    "the last lines in the tables represent the results of p - beam axis which show the spin down most of the time as expected .",
    "another quantity concerning the spin - induced angular correlations is the spin asymmetry @xmath79 in the case where spin - up and spin - down top quarks are both present spin asymmetry appears in the differential distribution of the decay angle presented in the first section      the last column of the table  [ tab1 ] shows that antineutrino or @xmath6-beam basis improves the asymmetry a factor of 1.7 when compared to lab helicity system . from table",
    "[ tab2 ] we see that this factor takes the value of 4 .",
    "clearly , it is easier to observe angular correlation as the asymmetry increases .",
    "comparison of table  [ tab1 ] and table  [ tab2 ] provides that the fraction of top quarks produced with right handed helicity in lab helicity frame gets smaller values as the center of mass energy of @xmath1 system gets larger .",
    ".dominant spin fractions and asymmetries for the various top quark spin bases in the production of single top process with @xmath0 fusion channel at @xmath2 tev tesla+herap energy .",
    "contributions from each @xmath35 and @xmath36 processes and combination of them are listed .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is useful to plot the top quark @xmath81 distributions to compare different spin bases .",
    "contributions from dominant spin components in lab helicity right , e - beam up , p - beam down states and unpolarized case(total ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for tesla+herap energy and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for clic+lhc energy , using the combination of @xmath35 and @xmath36 processes .",
    "similar features in tables are reflected in figures too .",
    "distributions of the singly produced top quarks via @xmath0 fusion at tesla+herap enegy @xmath2 tev .",
    "dominant spin bases lab helicity right , e - beam up , antineutrino up and unpolarized(total ) case are drawn .",
    "combination of @xmath35 and @xmath36 processes are considered .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]     distributions of the singly produced top quarks via @xmath0 fusion at clic+lhc enegy @xmath82 tev .",
    "dominant spin bases lab helicity right , e - beam up , antineutrino up and unpolarized(total ) case are drawn .",
    "combination of @xmath35 and @xmath36 processes are considered [ fig2 ] ]    in conclusion , we have shown that the single top quarks produced in the @xmath0 fusion channel in @xmath1 collision at energies @xmath2 and 5.3 tev are used to observe their high degree spin polarization along the direction of positron beam in the top quark rest frame .",
    "the tesla+herap gives better results leading higher spin polarization than clic+lhc .",
    "although @xmath1 and @xmath7 colliders are comparable in terms of high spin polarization , the @xmath0 fusion channel in @xmath1 collision is expected to be much less complicated theoretically and experimentally than the case in @xmath7 collision .",
