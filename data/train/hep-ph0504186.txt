    "<S> single top - quark production , via weak - interaction processes , is an important test of the standard model , potentially sensitive to new physics . </S>",
    "<S> however , this measurement is much more challenging at the tevatron than originally expected . </S>",
    "<S> we reexamine this process and suggest new methods , using shape variables , that can supplement the methods that have been discussed previously .    </S>",
    "<S> the electroweak production of single top quarks is an important standard model process which the tevatron is guaranteed to be able to study . </S>",
    "<S> this reaction , which has been investigated previously @xcite , is interesting both because it provides a direct measurement of the @xmath0 ckm  element and because it is sensitive to deviations of top quark physics from standard model predictions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> limits on single top production from run i at the tevatron have been published @xcite , and the first run ii limits have appeared @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this discussion will provide a brief overview on our recent work on this subject @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the executive summary is that a ) this process will be more difficult to study experimentally than previously thought , b ) we have developed new analysis methods , which will improve the significance of the measurement , and c ) even with our new analysis methods the unambiguous detection of this process remains a considerable challenge . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we suggest making use of more of the information encoded in the shape of the signal , in a way that will be less sensitive to systematic errors than a simple counting experiment . on the other hand , we also show that the size of and the uncertainties in the @xmath1-plus - jets background cause serious problems that at present make the measurement difficult at best .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ptbh ]    tbboth.eps    at fermilab energies , the `` @xmath2 '' production of a top quark and bottom antiquark by an @xmath3-channel @xmath1 boson , as can occur through the diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tb]a ) , has a lower cross - section than `` @xmath4 '' production via a @xmath5-channel @xmath1 boson of a @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and an extra quark jet near the beam axis , as occurs through diagrams such as that in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tb]b ) .    from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tb]b ) one can see that a @xmath4 event has a final partonic state consisting of at least the following : a charged lepton , a neutrino , @xmath7 and @xmath6 quarks , and a light quark . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in selecting @xmath5-channel signal events , one asks for ( a ) one @xmath7-tagged jet , ( b ) significant missing energy ( from the neutrino ) , ( c ) one and only one isolated @xmath8 or @xmath9 , ( d ) at least one non-@xmath7-tagged jet . </S>",
    "<S> typically , the highest-@xmath10 non-@xmath7-tagged jet in a @xmath5-channel event is that from the light quark . </S>",
    "<S> also , in typical events a @xmath5 quark can be reconstructed from the tagged jet and a @xmath1 , itself reconstructed from the charged lepton and the missing energy . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 process has a @xmath7 quark jet and a @xmath6 jet , along with a lepton and a neutrino . in a significant number of events , </S>",
    "<S> one of the two @xmath7-jets will not be tagged , so that the same criteria used for @xmath4 will have moderately high efficiency for this process as well .    </S>",
    "<S> the main backgrounds to single top production , which all can imitate the signature just described , are @xcite ( 1 ) @xmath11 , top quark pair production , primarily from events where only one of the top quarks decays leptonically ; ( 2 ) qcd  events with fake electrons or muons , or with real muons from heavy flavor decays ; and , most problematic , ( 3 ) @xmath12  events with a leptonically - decaying @xmath1 plus some number @xmath13 of quark or gluon jets . </S>",
    "<S> processes of all three types occur at rates well above the signal rate and so we must provide specialized cuts and other methods to reduce their contribution to the final event sample . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the @xmath14 background events tend to exhibit considerably more transverse energy than true single top events , to have more jets , and to be more spherical </S>",
    "<S> .  experience with the qcd  background suggests that it is generally reduced to a level comparable with the signal @xcite by fairly standard cuts and we will not focus on it here , except to note that our event shape methods will tend to also substantially reduce the qcd component of the event sample .  </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-plus - jets background is much more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath15 events potentially entering the sample consist of a real @xmath1 boson decaying leptonically , and at least two other quarks or gluons in the final state . while the @xmath15 events do tend to have smaller energetics than single top , and , of course , have no reconstructible @xmath5 quark ; the number of events is so large , and the energy resolution at fermilab is sufficiently broad , that the @xmath15 events form a large and problematic background to single - top production . reducing the systematic error on the prediction and/or measurement of this process is essential for success .    to model </S>",
    "<S> both signal and background , we have used madevent @xcite to generate events , pythia @xcite to then simulate showering and hadronization , and pgs @xcite to act as a fast detector simulation . </S>",
    "<S> ( see @xcite for the details of the calculations . ) </S>",
    "<S> jets containing a @xmath7 quark ( either perturbatively or produced during showering ) are taken to be tagged with an efficiency of the form @xmath16 , where @xmath10 is the transverse momentum of the jet . </S>",
    "<S> jets containing a @xmath17 quark ( either perturbatively or produced during showering ) are taken to be tagged with a rate of the form @xmath18 ; while jets containing no heavy flavor are taken to be mistagged with a rate of the form @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen for this study to cut also on the quantity @xmath20 which , compared to the signal , is smaller for @xmath15 and larger for @xmath14 . in this expression </S>",
    "<S> the sum is over all jets with @xmath21 gev and @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the magnitude of the transverse momentum of the @xmath24 jet , @xmath25 that of the lepton , and @xmath26 is the missing transverse energy in the event . </S>",
    "<S> since the signal involves a @xmath5-quark , we also impose a requirement that the invariant mass of the lepton , neutrino , and the leading tagged jet be within a window around the top quark mass .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that such cuts can not decrease the backgrounds to the point that they are comparable to the signal . </S>",
    "<S> two choices of intermediateand hard  cuts are indicated in table [ cuts2i ] . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting numbers of expected events for an integrated luminosity of 3 fb@xmath27 , summing over @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( and thus including both @xmath5 and @xmath28 ) , can be seen in table [ results1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with @xcite , we find that while all of the cuts contribute to the background reduction , the @xmath15 channel is reduced primarily by a combination of the stiffer @xmath10 cuts and the @xmath29  cut , while the @xmath30 background is affected primarily by the upper @xmath31 cut . while the intermediate cuts reveal a signal to background ratio of 1:7.4 , this improves to 1:4.9 using the hard cuts . </S>",
    "<S> ( the basic cuts used as a starting point in @xcite yield a signal to background ratio of approximately 1:21 . ) </S>",
    "<S> this result is , at best , disappointing and more pessimistic than @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( for a detailed comparison with the results of @xcite see @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> we are concerned that systematic errors in the understanding of the background will plague a direct counting experiment at a level that will make any claims of discovery suspect .    </S>",

    "<S> , forward jet is a distinctive signature , which the backgrounds do not share . </S>",
    "<S> we make use of this feature in our analysis of both signal and background events by including in our event definition the properties of `` the jet '' , defined to be the highest-@xmath10 non-@xmath7-tagged jet . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath4 process arises from an initial state light quark or antiquark scattering off a gluon , the @xmath4 system is typically boosted in the direction of the initial quark . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the motion of the final state light quark is typically in the same direction as its parent quark ( and the proton ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( the reverse is true for @xmath59 production . ) </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the electroweak interactions in both the production and decay of the top quark tends to align the momentum direction of `` the jet '' with that of the final - state charged lepton . </S>",
    "<S> thus the momentum vectors of the lepton and `` the jet '' are correlated as a result of both kinematics and spin polarization effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath14 process shares none of these properties . at tree - level , @xmath14 is separately c and p invariant , and shows none of the above asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> the parity - invariance is violated at the next order @xcite , at a level both small and calculable . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there should be no strong correlation between the momenta of the lepton and the jets in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> similar considerations apply , to a good approximation , to those qcd events which might pass our cuts , mainly events with fake leptons or with isolated leptons from heavy flavor decays . </S>",
    "<S> ( see @xcite for additional discussion of this point . )    </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetries and correlations in @xmath15 are similar to those of @xmath4 ( unfortunately ) although less pronounced . as with a @xmath5 quark , </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath60 is most likely to be produced moving in the proton direction . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to parity asymmetries which , though relatively small , are still quite large in absolute size compared to the signal . </S>",
    "<S> correlations between the lepton and `` the jet '' are nonzero , though relatively small . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the size of the asymmetries and correlations in @xmath15 appears to be very sensitive to assumptions , cuts , monte carlo parameters , and tagging , and will be a source of significant systematic error .    to make the use of these special properties of the signals and backgrounds we consider two - dimensional distributions in pseudo - rapidity . since the @xmath61 initial state of the tevatron is a cp eigenstate , the differential cross - section @xmath62 describing the rapidity distributions of `` the jet '' and the charged lepton in events with a _ positively _ charged lepton , and the corresponding distribution @xmath63 for processes with a _ negatively _ charged lepton , </S>",
    "<S> _ must _ be cp invariant : @xmath64 consequently , we can combine data from positively and negatively charged leptons by defining a _ lepton - charge - weighted pseudo - rapidity _ , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the lepton charge . </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of this discussion is based on the explicitly cp - invariant differential cross section @xmath68    to illustrate the characteristic properties of the various channels we will study@xcite a simulated event sample defined by cuts somewhat more relaxed  than those of table [ cuts2i ] , keeping a larger fraction of both the signal and the background . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated differences in shape are summarized in the contour plots of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ all4sig ] , which give the distributions ( @xmath69 ) of the various processes in the @xmath70 plane .    </S>",
    "<S> figures [ all4sig]a and [ all4sig]c illustrate the relative symmetry of the @xmath2 and @xmath14 channel , to be compared to the small asymmetry in the @xmath53 channel in fig .  [ all4sig]d and the large asymmetry in the @xmath4 signal channel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ all4sig]b . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the @xmath4 signal lies dominantly in the b quadrant , where the four quadrants of the @xmath70 plane are labeled in the form @xmath71 </S>",
    "<S> .  meanwhile @xmath2 is smaller with a less distinctive shape . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , @xmath14 is large though symmetrically distributed , and @xmath15 is large but has small asymmetries between the four quadrants , with slightly more cross - section in the a and b quadrants than in c and d.    to capture quantitatively these differences in shape between signal and background , we define three orthogonal functions in the @xmath72 plane . </S>",
    "<S> any differential cross - section can be written as a sum of three components @xmath73 where the components are of the form@xmath74,\\label{fbardef}\\end{aligned}\\]]@xmath75,\\label{fplusdef}\\end{aligned}\\]]@xmath76 .   </S>",
    "<S> \\label{fminusdef}%\\ ] ] these functions are orthogonal in the sense that the integral of any ( nonidentical ) pair over any symmetrically - defined region of the @xmath77 plane vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the functions provide important physical information about the symmetry properties of the differential cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath78 and @xmath79 are parity - even while @xmath80 is parity - odd ; thus @xmath81 ( within statistics ) for any parity - even distribution . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile @xmath79 will also vanish if the distribution is parity - even _ and _ the leptons and jets are uncorrelated . by construction @xmath78 and @xmath79 have four - way symmetry under reflection in the @xmath70 plane , </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath80 has two - way symmetry ( quadrants a and d are related , as are b and c , but quadrants a and b are independent ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the signal has strong asymmetries and correlations not present in the backgrounds yields the following expectations , @xmath82 thus the backgrounds are very large only in @xmath78 , while the signal has a much larger role to play in the other functions , especially away from the center of the @xmath70 plane .    </S>",
    "<S> these expectations are illustrated in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ allfbar ] , [ allfsym ] and [ allfasym ] , where the functions @xmath83 are shown , for @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> note , in particular , the presence of the symmetry properties discussed above .    </S>",
    "<S> thus we are led ( see @xcite for more details ) to suggest the following general approach . </S>",
    "<S> first construct , for both the data and the monte carlo simulations , the @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 functions . using these functions , as well as information obtained from other measurements , </S>",
    "<S> we systematically test our understanding of each process .  </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath78 function allows a measurement of the sum of the backgrounds without much contamination from signal . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the separation of @xmath15 from @xmath14 can be obtained using the fact that the @xmath14 process can be measured and predicted with reasonable accuracy , we can then cross - check our understanding of the @xmath15 background using part of the @xmath80 distribution ( located roughly in quadrant a ) where the signal is negligible . finally , one can attempt to measure the signal from @xmath79 and from another part ( located largely in quadrant b ) of the @xmath80 distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> a complete analysis of the above ideas has been carried out in @xcite , including estimates of the associated uncertainties , both statistical and systematic . </S>",
    "<S> the primary lesson is that , even when using the shape variables discussed above , the contributions of the backgrounds , especially @xmath15 , can not be rendered truly small compared to the signal . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is essential that we understand the backgrounds with high precision , including their shapes as employed here . </S>",
    "<S> this last point is especially challenging for the @xmath15 case , which receives comparable contributions from events with tags of @xmath7 quark jets , tags of @xmath17 quark jets and mistags of jets with no heavy flavor . </S>",
    "<S> likewise there are comparable contributions from when the heavy - flavor quark is present in the short - distance scattering and when it is produced in the subsequent showering . </S>",
    "<S> this means that our ability to accurately simulate the background depends on our understanding of a multitude of different specific channels , each with their own shapes and their own dependence on cuts , parton distributions and other parameters .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> a counting experiment for discovery of electroweak single - top production appears very challenging . </S>",
    "<S> we have explored the possibility of using the distinctive shape of this process to separate it from background . </S>",
    "<S> we have noted that the distributions for @xmath14 and for qcd in the @xmath70 plane are largely symmetric , while that of the signal is not ; the @xmath15 ( @xmath1-plus - jets ) background is intermediate between them . </S>",
    "<S> constructing the functions @xmath84 , which have various symmetry properties , we find that the statistical and systematic errors in the functions @xmath85 , which are orthogonal to the function @xmath78 ( that would be used in a counting experiment ) , can be brought close to reasonable size without using extreme cuts . </S>",
    "<S> our method largely removes @xmath14 and qcd events from the observables , making extreme cuts on @xmath14 unnecessary , and focusing attention on @xmath15 as the main background . </S>",
    "<S> the most challenging problem is understanding the shape of the @xmath15 background . </S>",
    "<S> we believe this calls for a dedicated study of the the rates , shapes , and flavor content ( especially of bottom versus charm ) of both @xmath15 and @xmath86 , with zero , one and two tagged jets , blended with theoretically precise predictions , and careful tuning and cross - checking of monte carlo simulations . </S>"
