    "the scale at which gravity becomes strong could be lowered as much as tev scale which is much below the naively expected one ( the reduced planck mass ) @xmath8 gev .",
    "it is because a large non - minimal coupling of a single scalar field or kaluza - klein(kk ) gravitons contribute to the renormalization group(rg ) running of the reduced planck mass  @xcite .",
    "moreover it is also well - known that the strong gravity scale could be different from the unitarity violation scale in linearized general relativity coupled to matter  @xcite .",
    "one important lesson from these recent studies is that the huge number of kk gravitons becomes a common source that lowers both of the scales , the strong gravity scale and the unitarity violation scale .",
    "for instance , in the large extra - dimensional model  @xcite there exist @xmath9 kk gravitons .",
    "the low scale quantum gravity is expected and the unitarity violation occurs at a few hundred gev .",
    "therefore it is an appropriate time to question whether other sources like kk gravitons exist or not , and how they affect both of the scales . keeping it in mind we focus on the gauge - higgs unified(ghu ) models  @xcite , which naturally provide the kk gauge , kk scalar bosons ( and kk fermions if bulk fermions are allowed ) .",
    "we show later that they can really change both of the scales depending on the number of extra dimensions @xmath3 .",
    "on the one hand , the @xmath3 is a crucial parameter in the ghu models .",
    "it constrains the structure of quartic terms of scalar potential . in the @xmath10",
    ", any quartic terms can not be generated at the tree - level in the scalar potential , while in the @xmath11 , tree - level quartic terms can be naturally generated from the commutators of zero modes in the field strength  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath3 significantly changes the total number of kk states . these increased kk states can lower the scale at which unitarity violates in the calculation of tree - level unitarity .",
    "more specifically , the partial - wave amplitude for a 2 @xmath12 2 elastic scattering  @xcite via s - channel graviton exchange is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the number of real scalars , fermions and vector fields in the given model , respectively .",
    "thus , the unitarity bound derived by @xmath18 shows strong dependence on the total number of the kk states .",
    "generally there are two fundamental energy scales in the ghu models .",
    "as easily anticipated , one is the compactification scale@xmath19 of extra dimensions , and the other one is the theory cutoff@xmath20 from the effective field theory point of view.~$ ] .",
    "see the ref.@xcite for detailed explanation about experiments and current constraints for the compactification radius and scale . ] . ] in this letter we introduce one more scale parameter@xmath21 reflecting the unitarity violation scale . because of the hierarchy between the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 there may be some debate .",
    "we simply discuss it in the last part of sec .",
    "ii .    as two interesting benchmark models",
    ", we consider @xmath0 and @xmath1 which have the zero modes corresponding to the particle content of the standard model(sm ) and the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm ) , respectively .",
    "we find that the strong gravity scale could be lowered as much as a few hundred tev .",
    "we also find that the supersymmetry not only make the maximum compactification scales of the extra dimensions converge into one special scale near planck scale irrespectively of @xmath3 , but also help to remove discordance between the strong gravity scale and the unitarity violation scale .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly introduce the model , and show how to obtain these two scales @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "next we consider aforementioned two models , @xmath0 and @xmath1 in order to show model - dependent results .",
    "finally we analyze their numerical results , and discuss several scenarios depending on hierarchical patterns among three scales @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 . in sec .",
    "iii we summarize our paper .",
    ".scattering amplitudes  @xcite for ( complex ) scalars , fermions , and vector bosons via s - channel graviton exchange .",
    "they are written in terms of the wigner @xmath27 functions  @xcite in the massless limit . an overall factor",
    "@xmath28 has been extracted from all amplitudes .",
    "the subscripts on the particles indicate their helicities . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the theory enters into the strong interaction region above @xmath25 scale because the perturbativity of the model breaks down .",
    "the ( perturbative ) effective field theory remains valid below this scale .",
    "however it is not consistent because the @xmath24 is already smaller than the @xmath25 .      in this case",
    ", there exists an intermediate energy gap between the strong gravity scale and the unitarity violation scale @xmath31see fig.[fig : figure4](a)@xmath32 . in order to make the theory consistent",
    "we should assume some mechanism or new physics that can restore the unitarity .",
    "actually , this scenario happens in the @xmath33 .",
    "here the @xmath24 is about ten times larger than @xmath25 ( see table [ tab : table2 ] and table [ tab : table3 ] ) .",
    "as one candidate of new physics , the stringy effects may help to remedy the unitarity violation .",
    "if it really happens , they may leave some new physics signals at that scale .      in the @xmath35 case ,",
    "this scenario is realized @xmath31see fig .  [ fig : figure4 ]  ( b)@xmath32 . there is no unnatural discordance between the @xmath25 and the @xmath24 scales .",
    "any new physics is not needed in order to remedy the unitarity violation .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall that the zero modes increased by supersymmetry can reduce the gap between the @xmath25 and the @xmath24 scales due to the reduced @xmath36 and increased kk numbers in the eq.([eq : lambda_unit ] ) .      in this scenario",
    ", there exists only one new physics scale .",
    "it is thus impossible to have any kk states except zero modes because there is no room for them .",
    "whole spectrum consists of all zero modes .",
    "consequently the effective ghu models may not be distinguishable from the sm if there are no additional zero modes .     in linearized general relativity coupled to the gauge - higgs unified(ghu ) model .",
    "the yellow regions show the quantum gravity region .",
    "the red regions correspond to the weak gravity region in which kk states can live .",
    "the left panel ( a ) shows that there exists the discordance between @xmath22 and @xmath23 . the central panel ( b )",
    "shows that the @xmath23 has the same order of magnitude as the @xmath22 scale .",
    "the right panel ( c ) shows that three scales coincide .",
    "it is thus expected that there is different physics at around the @xmath25 scale in each case . ]",
    "in summary , we have studied the strong gravity scale and the unitarity violation scale in linearized general relativity coupled to particle content of the ghu model .",
    "the kk gauge bosons , kk scalars and kk fermions in the ghu models drastically change both of the scales .",
    "in particular we have considered the two interesting benchmark models , @xmath0 and @xmath1 in order to show model - dependent difference .",
    "we have found that the strong gravity scale could be lowered as much as @xmath2 gev in the @xmath0(@xmath1 ) by taking @xmath38 tev and @xmath10 .",
    "it is also shown that these scales are proportional to the inverse of @xmath3 . in the @xmath4 case",
    ", they could be lowered up to @xmath5 gev for both of the models .",
    "we have also found that the maximum compactification scales @xmath39 of extra dimensions quickly converge into one special scale @xmath40 near planck scale or equivalently into one common radius @xmath41 irrespectively of @xmath3 , when the number of zero modes increases ( for example , @xmath42 .",
    "it may mean that there is the unification of compactification radii near planck scale analogously to the unification of gauge couplings in the mssm .",
    "moreover , it is also interesting that the supersymmetry helps to remove the discordance between the @xmath25 and the @xmath24 scales .",
    "consequently , it may reveal that the supersymmetry can play another important role in extra dimensions .",
