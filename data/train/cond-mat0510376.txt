    "pseudogap formation in the electronic spectrum of underdoped copper oxides @xcite is especially striking anomaly of the normal state of high temperature superconductors . despite continuing discussions on the nature of the pseudogap , we believe that the preferable `` scenario '' for its formation is most likely based on the model of strong scattering of the charge carriers by short  ranged antiferromagnetic ( afm , sdw ) spin fluctuations @xcite . in momentum representation",
    "this scattering transfers momenta of the order of @xmath3 ( @xmath4  lattice constant of two dimensional lattice ) .",
    "this leads to the formation of structures in the one - particle spectrum , which are precursors of the changes in the spectra due to long  range afm order ( period doubling ) . as a result",
    "we obtain non  fermi liquid like behavior ( dielectrization ) of the spectral density in the vicinity of the so called `` hot spots '' on the fermi surface , appearing at intersections of the fermi surface with antiferromagnetic brillouin zone boundary @xcite .    within this",
    "fluctuation scenario a simplified model of the pseudogap state was studied @xcite under the assumption that the scattering by dynamic spin fluctuations can be reduced for high enough temperatures to a static gaussian random field ( quenched disorder ) of pseudogap fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations are defined by a characteristic scattering vector from the vicinity of @xmath5 , with a width determined by the inverse correlation length of short  range order @xmath6 .",
    "undoped cuprates are antiferromagnetic mott insulators with @xmath7 ( @xmath2  value of local coulomb interaction , @xmath8  bandwidth of non  interacting band ) , so that correlation effects are actually very important .",
    "it is thus clear that the electronic properties of underdoped ( and probably also optimally doped ) cuprates are governed by strong electronic correlations too , so that these systems are typical strongly correlated metals .",
    "two types of correlated metals can be distinguished : ( i ) the doped mott insulator and ( ii ) the bandwidth controlled correlated metal @xmath9 .    a state of the art tool to describe such correlated systems is the dynamical mean ",
    "field theory ( dmft ) @xcite .",
    "the characteristic features of correlated systems within the dmft are the formation of incoherent structures , the so - called hubbard bands , split by the coulomb interaction @xmath2 , and a quasiparticle ( conduction ) band near the fermi level dynamically generated by the local correlations @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the dmft is not useful to the study the `` antiferromagnetic '' scenario of pseudogap formation in strongly correlated metals .",
    "this is due to the basic approximation of the dmft , which amounts to the complete neglect of non  local dynamical correlation effects .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to describe the main results of a semiphenomenological approach , formulated by us recently to overcome this difficulty @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ leng_intro ]",
    "we present a formulation of the self  consistent generalization we call dmft+@xmath0 which includes short  ranged ( non  local ) correlations .",
    "section [ kself ] describes the construction of the * k*dependent self  energy , and some computational details are presented in section [ compdet ] .",
    "results and a discussion are given in the sections [ results ] and [ concl ] .",
    "basic shortcoming of traditional dmft approach @xcite is the neglect of momentum dependence of electron self  energy .",
    "this approximation in principle allows for an exact solution of correlated electron systems ( in infinite dimensions ) fully preserving the local part of the dynamics introduced by electronic correlations . to include non  local effects ,",
    "while remaining within the usual `` impurity analogy''of dmft , we propose the following procedure . to be definite ,",
    "let us consider a standard one - band hubbard model .",
    "the extension to multi ",
    "orbital or multi  band models is straightforward .",
    "the major assumption of our approach is that the lattice and matsubara `` time '' fourier transform of the single - particle green function can be written as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the _ local _ contribution to self  energy , surviving in the dmft , while @xmath12 is some momentum dependent part .",
    "we suppose that this last contribution is due to either electron interactions with some `` additional '' collective modes or order parameter fluctuations , or may be due to similar non  local contributions within the hubbard model itself .",
    "to avoid possible confusion we must stress that @xmath12 can also contain local ( momentum independent ) contribution which obviously _ vanishes _ in the limit of infinite dimensionality @xmath13 and is not taken into account within the standard dmft . due to this fact there is no double counting of diagrams problem within our approach for the hubbard model .",
    "this question does not arise at all if we consider @xmath12 appearing due to some `` additional '' interaction .",
    "more important is that the assumed additive form of self  energy @xmath14 implicitly corresponds to neglect of possible interference of these local ( dmft ) and non  local contributions .    the self  consistency equations of our generalized dmft+@xmath0 approach are formulated as follows @xcite :    1 .",
    "start with some initial guess of _ local _ self  energy @xmath11 , e.g. @xmath15 .",
    "2 .   construct @xmath12 within some ( approximate ) scheme , taking into account interactions with collective modes or order parameter fluctuations which in general can depend on @xmath11 and @xmath16 .",
    "3 .   calculate the local green function @xmath17 4 .",
    "define the `` weiss field '' @xmath18 5 .",
    "using some `` impurity solver '' to calculate the single - particle green function for the effective anderson impurity problem , defined by grassmanian integral @xmath19 with effective action for a fixed site ( `` impurity '' ) @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "this step produces a _ new _ set of values @xmath24 .",
    "new _ local self ",
    "energy @xmath25 7 .   using this self  energy as `` initial '' one in step 1 , continue the procedure until ( and",
    "if ) convergency is reached to obtain @xmath26    eventually , we get the desired green function in the form of ( [ gk ] ) , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are those appearing at the end of our iteration procedure .",
    "for the momentum dependent part of the single - particle self  energy we concentrate on the effects of scattering of electrons from collective short - range sdw  like antiferromagnetic spin ( or cdw  like charge ) fluctuations . to calculate @xmath12 for an electron moving in the quenched random field of ( static ) gaussian spin ( or charge ) fluctuations with dominant scattering momentum transfers from the vicinity of some characteristic vector @xmath5 ( `` hot spots '' model @xcite ) , we use a slightly generalized version of the recursion procedure proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite which takes into account _ all _ feynman diagrams describing the scattering of electrons by this random field .",
    "this becomes possible due to a remarkable property of our simplified version of `` hot spots '' model that _ the contribution of an arbitrary diagram with intersecting interaction lines is actually equal to the contribution of some diagram of the same order without intersections of these lines _ @xcite .",
    "thus , in fact we can limit ourselves to consideration of only diagrams without intersecting interaction lines , taking the contribution of diagrams with intersections into account with the help of additional combinatorial factors , which are attributed to `` initial '' vertices or just interaction lines @xcite . as a result",
    "we obtain the following recursion relation ( continuous fraction representation @xcite ) for the desired self  energy : @xmath27 with @xmath28 the quantity @xmath29 characterizes the energy scale and @xmath6 is the inverse correlation length of short range sdw ( cdw ) fluctuations , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for odd @xmath32 while @xmath33 and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are determined by usual momentum derivatives of the `` bare '' electronic energy dispersion @xmath36 .",
    "finally , @xmath37 represents a combinatorial factor with @xmath38 for the case of commensurate charge ( cdw type ) fluctuations with @xmath39 @xcite . for incommensurate cdw fluctuations @xcite",
    "one finds @xmath40 if we take into account the ( heisenberg ) spin structure of interaction with spin fluctuations in `` nearly antiferromagnetic fermi  liquid '' ( spin  fermion ( sf ) model ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the combinatorics of diagrams becomes more complicated .",
    "spin  conserving scattering processes obeys commensurate combinatorics , while spin ",
    "flip scattering is described by diagrams of incommensurate type ( `` charged '' random field in terms of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this model",
    "the recursion relation for the single - particle green function is again given by ( [ rec ] ) , but the combinatorial factor @xmath37 now acquires the following form @xcite : @xmath41 obviously , with this procedure we introduce an important length scale @xmath42 not present in standard dmft . physically this scale mimics the effect of short  range ( sdw or cdw ) correlations within fermionic `` bath '' surrounding the effective anderson impurity .",
    "we expect that such a length  scale dependence will lead to a competition between local and non - local physics .",
    "an important aspect of the theory is that both parameters @xmath29 and @xmath42 can in principle be calculated from the microscopic model at hand .",
    "for example , using the two  particle selfconsistent approach of ref .",
    "@xcite with the approximations introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , one can derive @xcite within the standard hubbard model the following microscopic expression for @xmath29 : @xmath43=\\nonumber\\\\ = u^2\\frac{<n_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow}>}{n^2}<(n_{i\\uparrow } -n_{i\\downarrow})^2 > = \\nonumber\\\\ = u^2\\frac{<n_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow}>}{n^2}\\frac{1}{3}<{\\vec s}_i^2 > , \\label{delthubb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we consider only scattering from antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "different local quantities here  spin fluctuation @xmath44 , density @xmath32 and double occupancy @xmath45  can easily be calculated within the standard dmft @xcite .",
    "we performed such calculations  @xcite for wide range of @xmath2 and filling factors @xmath32 using quantum monte ",
    "carlo ( qmc )  @xcite . from these calculations",
    "we can see that the values of @xmath29 lie in the interval of @xmath46 and change rather smoothly with @xmath32 and @xmath2 .",
    "microscopic expressions for the correlation length @xmath47 can also be derived within the two  particle self ",
    "consistent approach @xcite .",
    "however , we expect those results for @xmath42 to be less reliable , because this approach is valid only for relatively small ( or medium ) values of @xmath48 and for purely two  dimensional case ( while real systems are quasi  two  dimensional ) .    thus , in the following we will consider both @xmath29 and especially @xmath42 as some phenomenological parameters to be determined from experiments .",
    "this makes our approach somehow similar in the spirit to landau approach to fermi  liquids .",
    "our construction can be further generalized to include other types of interactions .",
    "thus scattering by random impurities with point  like potential @xmath49 is easily taken into account in self ",
    "consistent born approximation @xcite .",
    "then , in comparison with impurity free case , just we have a substitution ( renormalization ) : @xmath50 if we do not perform fully self  consistent calculations of impurity self  energy , in the simplest approximation we just have : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the standard born impurity scattering rate ( @xmath53 is the density of states of `` free '' electrons at the fermi level ) .",
    "in the following , we discuss results for a standard one - band hubbard model on a square lattice . with",

    "the correlated metal in the case of @xmath60 is considered for the case of @xmath61 and filling factor @xmath59 ( hole doping ) .",
    "for @xmath29 we have choosen rather typical values between @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( actually as approximate limiting values obtained from ( [ delthubb ] ) via qmc calculations in ref.@xcite ) and for the correlation length we considered mainly @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( being motivated mainly by experimental data for cuprates  @xcite ) .",

    "let us start the discussion of results obtained within our generalized dmft+@xmath0 approach with the densities of states ( doss ) for the case of small ( relative to bandwidth ) coulomb interaction @xmath61 with and without pseudogap fluctuations . as already discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the characteristic feature of the strongly correlated metallic state is the coexistence of lower and upper hubbard bands split by the value of @xmath2 with a quasiparticle peak at the fermi level .",
    "since at half  filling the bare dos of the square lattice has a van  hove singularity at the fermi level ( @xmath66 ) or close to it ( in case of @xmath72 ) one can not treat a peak on the fermi level simply as a quasiparticle peak . in fact , there are two contributions to this peak from ( i ) the quasiparticle peak appearing in strongly correlated metals due to many - body effects and ( ii ) the smoothed van  hove singularity from the bare dos . in fig .",
    "[ dos_4t_n08 ] we show the corresponding dmft(nrg ) doss without pseudogap fluctuations as black lines for @xmath59 for both bare dispersions @xmath72 ( left panels ) and for @xmath66 ( right panels ) for two different temperatures @xmath69 ( middle panels ) and @xmath68 ( upper and lower panels ) .",
    "the remaining curves in fig .  [ dos_4t_n08 ] represent results for the doss with non - local fluctuations switched on .",
    "for all sets of parameters one can see that the introduction of non - local fluctuations into the calculation leads to the formation of pseudogap within the quasiparticle peak .    for @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "[ dos_4t_n08 ] ) the picture of dos is slightly asymmetric .",
    "the width of the pseudogap ( the distance between peaks closest to fermi level ) appears to be of the order of @xmath73 .",
    "we have checked that decreasing the value of @xmath29 from @xmath74 to @xmath54 leads to a pseugogap that is correspondingly twice smaller and in addition more shallow .",
    "when one uses the combinatorial factors corresponding to the spin  fermion model ( eq.([vspin ] ) ) , the pseudogap becomes more pronounced than in the case of commensurate charge fluctuations ( combinatorial factors of eq .",
    "( [ vinc ] ) ) . the influence of the correlation length @xmath42 is also as expected .",
    "changing @xmath75 from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , i.e.  decreasing the range of the non - local fluctuations , slightly washes out the pseudogap . also , increasing the temperature from @xmath68 to @xmath69 leads to a general broadening of the structures in the doss .",
    "noteworthy is the fact that for @xmath72 and @xmath77 the pseudogap has almost disappeared for the temperatures studied here .",
    "also very remarkable point is the similarity of the results obtained with the generalized dmft+@xmath0 approach with @xmath61 ( smaller than the bandwidth @xmath8 ) to those obtained earlier without hubbard  like coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the case of a doped mott insulator .",
    "the model parameters are again taken as @xmath72 with filling factor of @xmath59 , but the coulomb interaction strength is set to @xmath58 .",
    "characteristic features of the dos for such a strongly correlated metal are a strong separation of lower and upper hubbard bands and a fermi level crossing by the lower hubbard band ( for non  half  filled case ) . without non - local fluctuations the quasi ",
    "particle peak is again formed at the fermi level , but now the upper hubbard band is far to the right and does not touch the quasiparticle peak ( as it was for the case of small coulomb interactions ) .",
    "pseudogap appears close to the middle of quasiparticle peak .",
    "in addition we observe that the lower hubbard band is slightly broadened by fluctuation effects .",
    "qualitative behaviour of the pseudogap anomalies is similar to those described above for the case of @xmath61 , e.g.  a decrease of @xmath42 makes the pseudogap less pronounced , while reducing @xmath29 from @xmath78 to @xmath79 narrows of the pseudogap and also makes it more shallow .",
    "note that for the doped mott  insulator the pseudogap is remarkably more pronounced for the sdw  like fluctuations than for cdw  like fluctuations .",
    "there are , however , quite clear differences to the case of @xmath61 . for example",
    ", the width of the pseudogap appears to be much smaller than @xmath80 , which we attribute to the fact that the quasiparticle peak itself is actually rather narrow in the case of doped mott insulator .",
    "random impurity scattering , in general case leads to the filling of the pseudogap with the growth of impurity scattering rate both for correlated metal and doped mott insulator . as a typical example , in fig .",
    "[ dos_40t_04_imp ] we show results of our calculations for the case of doped mott insulator .",
    "these were obtained via non self  consistent procedure ( using ( [ renepsi ] ) , ( [ etaepsi ] ) , as full self  consistent procedure leads only to rather insignificant quantitative changes .      in the previous subsection we discussed the densities of states obtained self  consistently by the dmft+@xmath0 approach .",
    "once we get a self  consistent solution of the dmft+@xmath0 equations with non - local fluctuations we can , of course , also compute the spectral functions @xmath81 @xmath82 where self  energy @xmath83 and chemical potential @xmath16 are calculated self  consistently as described in sec .",

    "the corresponding spectral functions @xmath81 are depicted in fig .  [ sf_u4t_n08 ] . when @xmath72 ( upper row ) , the spectral function close to the brillouin zone diagonal ( point b ) has the typical fermi  liquid behaviour , consisting of a rather sharp peak close to the fermi level . in the case of sdw  like fluctuations this peak is shifted down in energy by about @xmath85 ( left upper corner ) . in the vicinity of the `` hot  spot '' the shape of @xmath81",

    "quite similar behavior was first observed in pioneering paper by norman et al.@xcite and in numerous later arpes experiments .",
    "it is seen , that `` destruction '' of the fermi surface starts in the vicinity of `` hot spots '' for small values of @xmath29 , but almost immediately it disappears in the whole antinodal region of the brillouin zone , while only `` fermi arcs '' remain in the nodal region very close to the `` bare '' fermi surface .",

    "[ fs_u4 ] , [ fs_u40 ] it is clearly seen that rather natural definition of the fermi surface as defined by the solution of the equation @xmath92 for @xmath91 , used e.g. in ref.@xcite is inadequate for strongly correlated systems with finite @xmath2 and nonlocal interactions ( pseudogap fluctuations ) .",
    "to summarize , we propose a generalized dmft+@xmath0 approach , which is meant to take into account the important effects due to non  local correlations in a systematic , but to some extent phenomenological fashion .",
    "the main idea of this extension is to stay within a usual effective anderson impurity analogy , and introduce length scale dependence due to non - local correlation via the effective medium ( `` bath '' ) appearing in the standard dmft .",
    "this becomes possible by incorporating scattering processes of fermions in the `` bath '' from non  local collective sdw  like antiferromagnetic spin ( or cdw  like charge ) fluctuations .",
    "such a generalization of the dmft allows one to overcome the well  known shortcoming of @xmath84independence of self  energy of the standard dmft . it in turn opens the possibility to access the physics of low  dimensional strongly correlated systems , where different types of spatial fluctuations ( e.g. of some order parameter ) , become important .",

    "we addressed the problem of pseudogap formation in the strongly correlated metallic state .",
    "we showed evidence that the pseudogap appears at the fermi level within the quasiparticle peak , introducing a new small energy scale of the order of @xmath29 in the doss and spectral functions @xmath81 and significant renormalization of the fermi surface .",
