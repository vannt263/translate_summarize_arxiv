    "although it has long been known that cool main - sequence stars have hot outer atmospheres the question of how these regions are heated remains unanswered .",
    "this is , in part , due to the complexity of stellar atmospheres arising from the interplay of sub - photospheric convection , rotation and magnetic fields  in order to distinguish between different physical processes quantitative analyses and models are required .",
    "atmospheric models fall into two broad categories , those which are constructed from theory ( e.g. those developed by fontenla , avrett & loeser 1993 , 2002 or cuntz et al .",
    "1999 ) and those which are constructed semi - empirically , based on a combination of observations and a few elementary physical assumptions ( e.g. the vernazza , avrett & loeser 1973 , 1976 , 1981 solar models ) .",
    "semi - empirical models are vital since it is only by comparison with properties deduced from observations that theoretical models can be tested .    in this paper new semi -",
    "empirical models are developed for the chromosphere and lower transition region of the k2-dwarf @xmath0  eri .",
    "this complements our recent studies of the outer atmosphere in which the mean electron pressure was measured ( jordan et al .",
    "2001a ) ; line widths were measured and used to investigate the non - thermal velocity fields within the atmosphere and place constraints upon the possibility of coronal heating by wave dissipation ( sim & jordan 2003a ) ; and emission measure distributions were used to derive new information about the area occupied by emitting material in the upper transition region ( sim & jordan 2003b ) .    previously , semi - empirical models have been constructed for @xmath0  eri by kelch ( 1978 ) , simon , kelch & linsky ( 1980 ) and thatcher , robinson & rees ( 1991 ) .",
    "the kelch ( 1978 ) model was based on observations of the ca  ii and mg  ii resonance lines and described the upper photosphere and chromosphere ( extending to an electron temperature @xmath1 = 4.3 $ ] ) .",
    "simon et al . ( 1980 ) used ultraviolet observations of si  ii , si  iii and c  ii recorded with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) to develop the upper parts of the kelch ( 1978 ) model .",
    "their model extends to @xmath1 = 4.7 $ ] .",
    "thatcher et al .",
    "( 1991 ) used infrared lines of ca  ii , the na d doublet and lines from the h balmer series to further develop the chromospheric part of the kelch ( 1978 ) model and extended the model to @xmath1 = 5.6 $ ] .",
    "the new models presented here are based on ultraviolet observations made with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ and with the _ far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) satellite ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the high signal - to - noise ratio , high spectral resolution and large combined spectral coverage of these data are ideal for quantitative modelling ; they provide much tighter constraints on the model than did the _ iue _ data and allow much more robust conclusions to be drawn . in particular , the improved measurements of the transition region pressure , together with radiative transfer calculations , lead to more reliable models from the photosphere to the transition region .",
    "an important limitation of the available spectroscopic data is that , in common with all such observations of main - sequence stars other than the sun , they contain no direct information on the spatial inhomogeneities ( because the source is unresolved ) .",
    "although we have been able to deduce information about the inhomogeneity in the upper transition region ( sim & jordan 2003b ) , the same method can not yet be applied to the deeper parts of the atmosphere since the local means of energy deposition is not understood . here , for the most part , the simplest assumption , that of homogeneity , is made  thus the models are representative of the `` average '' atmosphere .",
    "although the interpretation of `` average '' models requires considerable care , they are extremely important since they contain the most information that can be extracted directly from the data alone and theoretical models must be consistent with the mean properties . two - component theoretical models of a k2  v star chromosphere have been made by cuntz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , using empirical relations between the area covered by magnetic fields and stellar rotation periods .",
    "we also derive a two - component by applying the emitting area that we found at @xmath2  k ( sim & jordan 2003b ) as an upper limit to regions at lower temperatures ",
    "solar observations show that the area occupied by supergranulation cells remains constant between @xmath3  k and @xmath2  k , before decreasing in the chromosphere .",
    "another limitation to the modelling is the accuracy of the atomic data used  for many of the measured line fluxes , the observational uncertainty is small compared to possible errors in the atomic rates . in particular , the standard sets of ionisation balance calculations used for transition region lines are inadequate for modelling to the precision of the stis data . in this paper a new ionisation balance calculation is presented in which rates that account for variations in the dielectronic recombination rate with density are used ; although not definitive , this calculation highlights the need for further work on recombination rates at non - zero density .",
    "the ultraviolet observations and measurements of the emission line fluxes are discussed in section 2 . in section 3",
    "the new ionisation balance calculations are discussed .",
    "they are used in the construction of emission measure distributions ( emds ) in section 4 .",
    "a preliminary single - component atmospheric model is developed in section 5 and improvements to this model are discussed in section 6 . in section  7 , the simple two - component model is presented and conclusions are drawn in section 8 .",
    "the models developed are based on measurements of fluxes for a variety of emission lines in stis and _ fuse _ spectra of @xmath0  eri .",
    "table  1 gives the measured fluxes for lines in the stis spectra ( see jordan et al .",
    "2001b for details of our stis spectra ) .",
    "these were obtained by direct integration across line profiles and , where possible , by performing single - gaussian fits .",
    "( the line widths and shifts deduced from gaussian fits have been published elsewhere : sim & jordan 2003a . ) the errors given are tolerances based on the signal - to - noise , the uncertainty in the background level and , where applicable , the goodness of the gaussian fits .",
    "four of the lines listed in table  1 are affected by blending .",
    "three of these ( o  iv 1404.8   , si  ii 2335.3    and s  iv 1404.8   ) have been discussed by jordan et al . ( 2001a ) . the other ,",
    "si  ii 1260.4   , is suspected to be a close blend with c  i 1260.6   . the al  iii @xmath4s@xmath5 ",
    "@xmath4p@xmath5 line at 1862.8     it too weak to measure .",
    "this suggests that the al  iii 1854.7-   line is also blended , probably with an iron line .",
    "( in the optically thin limit the al  iii 1854.7-  line should have double the flux of the 1862.8-  line , but the observed 1854.7-  feature is more than twice as strong as that at 1862.8   . )"
