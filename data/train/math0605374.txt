    "frames , which are systems that provide robust , stable and usually non - unique representations of vectors , have been a focus of study in the last two decades in applications where redundancy plays a vital and useful role , e.g. , filter bank theory @xcite , sigma - delta quantization @xcite , signal and image processing @xcite , and wireless communications @xcite .",
    "however , a number of new applications have emerged where the set - up can hardly be modeled naturally by one single frame system .",
    "they generally share a common property that requires distributed processing .",
    "furthermore , we are often overwhelmed by a deluge of data assigned to one single frame system , which becomes simply too large to be handled numerically . in these cases",
    "it would be highly beneficial to split a large frame system into a set of ( overlapping ) much smaller systems , and being able to process locally within each sub - system effectively .",
    "a distributed frame theory relating to a set of local frame systems is clearly in demand . in this paper",
    "we develop a suitable theory based on fusion frames , which provides exactly the framework not only to model these applications but also to provide efficient algorithms with sufficient robustness .",
    "a variety of applications require distributed processing . among them",
    "there are , for instance , wireless sensor networks @xcite , geophones in geophysics measurements and studies @xcite , the physiological structure of ear and hearing systems @xcite . to understand the nature , the constraints , and related problems of these applications , let us elaborate a bit further on the example of wireless sensor networks .    in wireless sensor networks ,",
    "sensors of limited capacity and power are spread in an area sometimes as large as an entire forest to measure the temperature , sound , vibration , pressure , motion and/or pollutants . in some applications ,",
    "wireless sensors are placed in a geographical area to detect and characterize chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear material .",
    "such a sensor system is typically redundant , and there is no orthogonality among sensors , therefore each sensor functions as a frame element in the system . due to",
    "practical and cost reasons , most sensors employed in such applications have severe constraints in their processing power and transmission bandwidth . they often have strictly metered power supply as well . consequently , a typical large sensor network necessarily divides the network into redundant sub - networks ",
    "forming a set of subspaces .",
    "the primary goal is to have local measurements transmitted to a local sub - station within a subspace for a subspace combining .",
    "an entire sensor system in such applications could have a number of such local processing centers .",
    "they function as relay stations , and have the gathered information further submitted to a central processing station for final assembly .    in such applications ,",
    "distributed / local processing is built in the problem formulation .",
    "a staged processing structure is prescribed .",
    "we will have to be able to process the information stage by stage from local information and to eventually fuse them together at the central station .",
    "we see therefore that a mechanism of coherently collecting sub - station / subspace information is required .",
    "meantime , due to the often - time unpredictable nature of geographical factors , certain local sensor systems are less reliable than others . while facing the task of combining local subspace information coherently",
    ", one has also reasons to consider weighting the more reliable sets of substation information more than suspected less reliable ones .",
    "consequently , the coherent combination mechanism we just saw as necessary often requires a weighted structure as well .",
    "we will show that fusion frame systems are created to fit such weighted and coherent fusion needs .      in case",
    "that a frame system is simply too large to handle effectively from the numerical stand point , there are needs to divide the large system into smaller and parallel ones . like many parallel processing mechanisms",
    ", one may consider splitting the large system into multiple small systems for simpler and parallel processing .",
    "evidently , the subdivision mechanism must take into consideration a coherent combination after the subsystem processing . to make the subdivision mechanism more robust",
    ", one may not want to ( sometimes it is also impossible to ) split the large system in an independent or orthogonal fashion .",
    "such a splitting and then a coherent combination must produce precisely the original result if the system were to be processed globally .",
    "fusion frame systems are created to fit such needs as well . weighted coherent combination of subsystems ( as provided by fusion frame theory )",
    "is also useful in such applications where losses of some subsystem information occur .",
    "sometimes , weighted coherent combination is also useful from an efficient and approximation point of view .",
    "some approaches such as the domain decomposition method @xcite also use coherent combinations .",
    "however the fusion frame theory will provide a much more flexible framework that also takes local frames into account .      in this article , we are interested in weighted sequences of subspaces with controlled `` overlaps '' .",
    "each subspace is equipped with local frames aiming at the development of a framework for the applications discussed above . in @xcite ,",
    "two of the authors studied redundant subspaces for the purpose of easing the construction of frames by building them locally in ( redundant ) subspaces and then piecing the local frames together by employing a special structure of the set of subspaces .",
    "this was referred to as a _ frame of subspaces_. related approaches were undertaken by aldroubi , cabrelli , and molter @xcite and fornasier @xcite .",
    "a similar idea was also used by aldroubi and grching in a quite different context in @xcite .",
    "moreover , bodmann , kribs , and paulsen employed parseval frames of subspaces for optimal transmission of quantum states @xcite .",
    "some further results on the theory from @xcite can be found in @xcite , and an extension was derived by sun @xcite , however without any possibility of equipping the subspaces with an underlying structure .",
    "we will employ some parts of this theory and set it into the context studied in this paper .",
    "the structure of the overlapping subspaces , e.g. , which relate to the sub - networks of a wireless sensor network , will be modeled by employing the notion from @xcite . to avoid confusion with the long existing term `` frame for subspaces '' and to emphasize the fact that this mathematical object will provide a framework to fuse data in the subspaces",
    ", we decided to coin it _ fusion frame _ in this context .",
    "in our situation it will become also essential to view a fusion frame together with a set of local frames for its subspaces , in which case we will speak of a _ fusion frame system_.    we observe that fusion frames contain conventional frames as a special case .",
    "this theory goes thereby `` beyond frame theory '' .",
    "it turns out that the fusion frame theory is in fact much more delicate due to complicated relations between the structure of the sequence of weighted subspaces and the local frames in the subspaces and due to the extreme sensitivity with respect to changes of the weights .",
    "our main motivation is to study fusion frame systems with respect to their reconstruction properties to not only provide a comprehensive model for applications which require distributed processing and which employ a distributed structure due to complexity reasons , but also to build efficient algorithms for fusion and reconstruction .",
    "we provide a general reconstruction formula by employing a so - called fusion frame operator , derive a variety of ways to fuse / reconstruct depending on the ability of the application to process off - line or only in real time , and present an iterative algorithm .",
    "since we are also concerned with applications having the choice between distributed and centralized reconstruction we further show that in very special cases those reconstructions are in fact performed by employing the same set of vectors , thereby presenting situations where distributed reconstruction demonstrates the same behavior as centralized reconstruction , e.g. , with respect to noise .    as discussed above , sensor networks in particular suffer significantly from disturbances of individual sensors or even whole sub - networks in the form of , e.g. , natural forces .",
    "this led us to the study of stability of fusion frame systems not only under perturbations of the subspaces themselves , but even more of the local frame vectors . in order to describe the properties of the affected sensor network explicitly , we present several results which , in particular , give precise estimates for the changes of certain properties of fusion frame systems .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in section [ sec : fusion_frames ] , the definition of fusion frames and fusion frame systems and their fundamental characterization will be given .",
    "examples of fusion frames are presented , and connections of fusion frames with conventional frames will be discussed . in section",
    "[ sec : fusion_reconstruction ] , several fusion frame reconstructions are presented .",
    "these are the coherent combinations we discussed earlier .",
    "both operator theoretical and its matrix representation are considered .",
    "an iterative fusion reconstruction is also constructed in this section .",
    "section [ sec : robustness ] is devoted to the robustness of fusion frames , in which the analysis of stability of fusion frame systems to perturbations is extensively carried out .",
    "conclusion remarks and application discussions are the subjects of the last section .",

    "it is nevertheless equally important to point out that the much larger @xmath138 operation requirement in ( [ eqn_distreconst2 ] ) can be carried out `` off - line '' , which often - times can be advantageous .",
    "fusion frame reconstruction can be carried out iteratively as well , just like in frame reconstructions @xcite .",
    "the specific mechanisms can also be divided in two different ways , depending on whether a local reconstruction actually takes place or not as given in ( [ eqn_distreconst1 ] ) or ( [ eqn_distreconst2 ] ) .",

    "the purpose of this section is to study the sequence of vectors employed for distributed reconstruction and to compare distributed with centralized reconstruction . for this , let @xmath51 be a fusion frame system for @xmath2 with local frame bounds @xmath25 , @xmath45 , and let @xmath142 , @xmath34 be associated local dual frames . since , by theorem  [ theo : frame_local_global ] , the sequence @xmath163 is a frame for @xmath2 , we might consider the situation that we are given the ( global ) frame coefficients @xmath164 of a signal @xmath11 .",

[ prop_dualff ] let @xmath51 be a fusion frame system for @xmath2 with associated fusion frame operator @xmath83 , local frame bounds @xmath124 and local dual frames @xmath170 , @xmath34 . then @xmath169 is a dual frame for the frame @xmath50 .",
    "first we note that @xmath50 indeed forms a frame by theorem [ theo : frame_local_global ] . employing the self - adjointness of @xmath83 ( proposition [ prop : ci_s_di ] )",
    ", we have for all @xmath11 , @xmath171 which finishes the proof .",
    "it is interesting to observe that a `` dual '' relation also holds .",
    "we wish to mention that this property does not have quite the same correspondence in conventional frames as well .",

    "then @xmath172 is a frame for @xmath2 and @xmath173 is a dual frame for it .",
    "the fact that @xmath172 is a frame for @xmath2 follows again from theorem [ theo : frame_local_global ] , since each local frame @xmath5 , @xmath34 has frame bounds @xmath174 , @xmath175 and thus possess a common lower and upper bound .",
    "now using the fact that @xmath176 and @xmath177 are a pair of dual frames of @xmath2 by proposition [ prop_dualff ] , we have for all @xmath178 , @xmath179    in order to compare distributed reconstruction with centralized reconstruction , it is essential to understand when @xmath169 equals the canonical dual frame of the frame @xmath163 ( compare also ) , since in these particular cases distributed and centralized reconstruction coincide . in general , this certainly need not be the case due to the observation that if we have a parseval fusion frame , then @xmath180 with the @xmath181 being the local frame operators , and hence due to the occurring cross terms , @xmath182 however , the following results give some special cases in which distributed and centralized reconstruction indeed coincide .    [ prop : centr = distr_duals ] let @xmath88 be a fusion frame system for @xmath2 with associated fusion frame operator @xmath83 , local frame bounds @xmath124 and local dual frames @xmath170 , @xmath34 . if @xmath4 is an orthogonal fusion basis or @xmath5 is a parseval frame sequence for all @xmath34 , then @xmath183 is the canonical dual frame of the frame @xmath50 .    by theorem [ theo : frame_local_global ] , the sequence @xmath163 forms a frame for @xmath2 , and",
    "we denote its frame operator by @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath4 is an orthogonal fusion basis , then @xmath184 i d and @xmath185 , and hence @xmath186 .",
    "provided that @xmath5 is a parseval frame sequence for all @xmath34 , we have @xmath187 i d for all @xmath34 , and we further obtain for all @xmath11 , @xmath188 in both cases the claim follows immediately from here .",
    "finally , we would like to point out a surprising fact concerning the situation of having parseval frames spanning the subspaces of a fusion frame , which arises from this result .",
    "let @xmath88 be a fusion frame system for @xmath2 with associated fusion frame operator @xmath83 , and let @xmath189 be parseval frames for all @xmath34 .",
    "by the previous result , the operator @xmath83 is _ independent _ of the choice of the parseval frame , since @xmath83 always equals the frame operator of the frame @xmath50 .",
    "the intuitive reason for this is that provided we take parseval frames for the subspaces , the frame property of the total collection of frame elements completely mirrors the behavior of the fusion frame .",
    "furthermore , we would like to briefly mention the impact of proposition [ prop : centr = distr_duals ] on the noise reduction under distributed and centralized reconstruction of this result .",
    "in @xcite rozell and johnson studied noise reduction under distributed reconstruction versus centralized reconstruction in finite dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "they used additive zero mean white noise , which they added to all frame coefficients with respect to the frame @xmath190 and derived bounds for the mean square error for distributed and centralized reconstruction . by numerical simulation",
    "they showed that randomly adding elements to a fusion frame not only improves the mean square error for distributed reconstruction , but even forces it to converge to the mean square error for centralized reconstruction .",
    "goyal , vetterli , and thao @xcite proved that a frame becomes asymptotically tight if elements are randomly added . by employing this result it was argued in @xcite that some very restrictive conditions on the local frames and the fusion fame structure might be fulfilled in the limit .    applying proposition [ prop : centr = distr_duals ] now gives a broader picture for this intriguing phenomenon .",
    "by @xcite , the local frames become asymptotically tight with the same frame bound , say @xmath25 , as more and more random elements are added . hence , by proposition [ prop : centr = distr_duals ] , the sequence @xmath191 , which is employed for the distributed reconstruction as outlined in ( except the constant @xmath192 ) , converges to the canonical dual frame of the frame @xmath50 , which is used for the centralized reconstruction .",
    "taking the fact into account that the additional multiplicative constant does not play any role concerning the noise reduction ability , reveals a reason for the phenomenon described in @xcite and does not require restrictive conditions .",
    "in this section we analyze the stability of fusion frame systems under perturbations of both the subspaces which constitute a fusion frame and the local frame vectors contained in the subspaces .",
    "the reason for this is that on the one hand , for instance , several complete groups of geophones @xcite might be moved to a slightly different location to adjust for transmission conditions , and on the other hand , for instance , in wireless sensor networks the location of single sensors might be changed slightly due to the impact of natural forces @xcite . therefore it is essential to study the robustness of fusion frame systems under these two different impacts .    thus , with these practical aspects in mind , we proceed by first examining perturbations of the subspaces in section [ subsec : pert_subspaces ] and secondly studying robustness of a fusion frame system under perturbations of the associated local frames in section [ subsec : pert_frames ] .",
    "first we would like to point out one fundamental problem with perturbations of fusion frames which is the cause of the serious technicalities in these results .",
    "since the main ingredient in the definition of a fusion frame are the orthogonal projections onto a set of subspaces , it would be natural to consider perturbations of these projections",
    ". however , there is no such thing as a perturbation of a projection .",
    "this means , that if @xmath193 and @xmath194 are projections on @xmath2 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 then it follows that @xmath197 .",
    "this can be easily seen by way of contradiction as follows :",
    "if @xmath198 , then there exists a vector @xmath23 so that @xmath199 , but also satisfying @xmath200 ( or vice - versa ) .",
    "this yields @xmath201 which is a contradiction .",
    "therefore , we define @xmath202-perturbations of sequences by employing the canonical paley - wiener - type definition :    let @xmath31 and @xmath203 be closed subspaces in @xmath2 , let @xmath32 be positive numbers , and let @xmath204 and @xmath205 . if @xmath206 then we say that @xmath207 is a _ @xmath208-perturbation _ of @xmath4 .",
