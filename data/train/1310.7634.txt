    "in his pioneering work , alan turing @xcite showed that stable spatial patterns can develop in reaction - diffusion systems which include chemical species ( morphogens ) with different diffusion constants . considering a system of two chemical species with concentrations @xmath0 and @xmath1 in one - dimensional interval",
    "@xmath2 $ ] , the underlying deterministic model of turing patterns can be written as a system of two reaction - diffusion partial differential equations ( pdes ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are diffusion constants of morphogens @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 describe chemical reactions . then the standard analysis proceeds as follows @xcite : a homogeneous steady state @xmath10 , @xmath11 is found by solving @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "it is shown that the homogenous steady state is stable when @xmath14 , and conditions on @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are obtained which guarantee that the homogeneous steady state will become unstable for @xmath17 . then turing patterns are observed at the steady state .",
    "the above argument was extensively analysed in the mathematical biology literature and conditions for turing patterns have been determined @xcite .",
    "experimental studies with chemical systems ( chlorite - iodide - malonic acid reaction ) demonstrated turing type patterns @xcite .",
    "there has also been experimental evidence that a simple turing patterning mechanism can appear in developmental biology , for example , in the regulation of hair follicle patterning in developing murine skin @xcite .",
    "one of the criticism of turing patters is their lack of robustness @xcite .",
    "the pde system ( [ upde])([vpde ] ) can have several stable non - homogeneous solutions which the system can achieve with relatively small perturbations to the initial condition . considering pdes in a suitably growing domain , one can obtain an additional constraint on the system which restricts the set of accessible patterns , increasing the robustness of pattern generation with respect to the initial conditions @xcite .",
    "however , to assess the sensitivity of patterns with respect to fluctuations , stochastic models have to be considered @xcite .",
    "one of the most common approaches to stochastic reaction - diffusion modelling is formulated in the compartment - based ( lattice - based ) framework @xcite . in the one - dimensional setting , the compartment - based analogue of the pde model ( [ upde])([vpde ] )",

    "the compartment - based approach has been used for both theoretical analysis and computational modelling @xcite .",

    "we will consider a simple one - dimensional schnakenberg model ( [ schnak ] ) where the reaction rate constants are given by @xcite @xmath55 and @xmath56 is a scale factor .",
    "we used @xmath57 in the illustrative simulation in figure [ figure1 ] . when there is no diffusion involved , the dynamics of this system can be represented as the system of reaction rate ordinary differential equations ( odes ) @xmath58 which has a unique stable steady state at @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "when we consider diffusion , the reaction - diffusion pdes ( [ upde])([vpde ] ) are given by @xmath61 we are implicitly assuming homogeneous neumann boundary conditions ( zero - flux ) in the whole paper , but both the pde model ( [ updeschnak])([vpdeschnak ] ) and its stochastic counterparts could also be generalized to different types of boundary conditions @xcite . using standard analysis of turing instabilities @xcite , one can show that the turing patterns are obtained for @xmath62 for the parameter values ( [ omegascaling ] ) .",
    "this condition is independent of @xmath63 the illustrative simulation in figure [ figure1 ] was computed for @xmath52 , i.e. the condition for ( deterministic , mean - field ) turing patterns was satisfied .",

    "one option to choose @xmath53 in the generalized model ( [ diffgillum ] ) and ( [ diffgillvm ] ) is to ensure that @xmath83 which implies @xmath84 then the jump rates @xmath67 and @xmath68 from the corresponding compartments are equal for molecules of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "however , we will not restrict to the case ( [ gammaformula ] ) and consider general choices of @xmath53 in this paper .",
    "the generalization of the first three propensities in ( [ firstfouralpha ] ) is straightforward .",
    "propensities @xmath85 and @xmath86 in ( [ firstfouralpha ] ) correspond to chemical species @xmath21 and we have the following propensities in the @xmath23-th compartment , @xmath87 : @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "it is given as @xmath93 .",
    "to generalize @xmath94 , we have to consider the occurrences of the trimolecular reaction @xmath95 in every small compartment in discretization of the @xmath21 variable . in the @xmath23-th compartment ,",
    "the propensity function @xmath94 is : @xmath96 where @xmath97 corresponds to the @xmath91-th compartment in the @xmath22 variable to which the @xmath23-th compartment belongs , i.e. @xmath98 the main idea of the compartment - based model is that the molecules of @xmath22 are considered to be well - mixed in the compartments of the size @xmath99 .",

    "<S> turing patterns can be observed in reaction - diffusion systems where chemical species have different diffusion constants . in recent years , several studies investigated the effects of noise on turing patterns and showed that the parameter regimes , for which stochastic turing patterns are observed , can be larger than the parameter regimes predicted by deterministic models , which are written in terms of partial differential equations for species concentrations . a common stochastic reaction - diffusion approach is written in terms of compartment - based ( lattice - based ) models , where the domain of interest is divided into artificial compartments and the number of molecules in each compartment is simulated . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of stochastic turing patterns on the compartment size is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> it has previously been shown ( for relatively simpler systems ) that a modeller should not choose compartment sizes which are too small or too large , and that the optimal compartment size depends on the diffusion constant . </S>",
    "<S> taking these results into account , we propose and study a compartment - based model of turing patterns where each chemical species is described using a different set of compartments . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the parameter regions where spatial patterns form are different from the regions obtained by classical deterministic pde - based models , but they are also different from the results obtained for the stochastic reaction - diffusion models which use a single set of compartments for all chemical species . in particular , it is argued that some previously reported results on the effect of noise on turing patterns in biological systems need to be reinterpreted . </S>"
