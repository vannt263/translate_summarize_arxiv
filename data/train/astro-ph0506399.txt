    "then rosat offered first detections of surface temperatures .",
    "next @xmath0-ray data came from chandra and xmm / newton .",

    "more upper limits and detections are expected from satellites planned to be sent in the nearest future . in general , the data can be separated in three groups .",
    "some data show very _ `` slow cooling '' _ of objects , other demonstrate an _ `` intermediate cooling '' _ and some show very _ `` rapid cooling''_. now we are at the position to carefully compare the data with existing cooling calculations .",
    "the `` standard '' scenario of neutron star cooling is based on the main process responsible for the cooling , which is the modified urca process ( mu ) @xmath1 calculated using the free one pion exchange between nucleons , see @xcite",
    ". however , this scenario explains only the group of slow cooling data . to explain a group of rapid cooling data",
    "`` standard '' scenario was supplemented by one of the so called `` exotic '' processes either with pion condensate , or with kaon condensate , or with hyperons , or involving the direct urca ( du ) reactions , see @xcite and refs therein .",
    "all these processes may occur only for the density higher than a critical density , @xmath2 , depending on the model , where @xmath3 is the nuclear saturation density .",
    "an other alternative to ",
    "exotic  processes is the du process on quarks related to the phase transition to quark matter .",
    "particularly the studies of cooling evolution of compact objects can give an opportunity for understanding of properties of cold quark gluon plasma .",
    "in dense quark matter at temperatures below @xmath4 mev , due to attractive interaction channels , the cooper pairing instability is expected to occur which should lead to a variety of possible quark pair condensates corresponding to color superconductivity ( csc ) phases , see @xcite for a review .    since it is difficult to provide low enough temperatures for csc phases in heavy - ion collisions , only precursor phenomena @xcite",
    "are expected under these conditions .",
    "csc phases may occur in neutron star interiors @xcite and could manifest themselves , e.g. , in the cooling behavior @xcite .",
    "however , the domain of the qcd phase diagram where neutron star conditions are met is not yet accessible to lattice qcd studies and theoretical approaches have to rely on non - perturbative qcd modeling .",

    "estimates of the cooling evolution have been performed @xcite for a self - bound isothermal quark core neutron star ( qcns ) which has a crust but no hadron shell , and for a quark star ( qs ) which has neither crust nor hadron shell .",
    "it has been shown there in the case of the 2sc ( 3sc ) phase of qcns that the consequences of the occurrence of gaps for the cooling curves are similar to the case of usual hadronic neutron stars ( enhanced cooling ) . however , for the cfl case it has been shown that the cooling is extremely fast since the drop in the specific heat of superconducting quark matter dominates over the reduction of the neutrino emissivity . as has been pointed out there , the abnormal rate of the temperature drop is the consequence of the approximation of homogeneous temperature profiles the applicability of which should be limited by the heat transport effects .",
    "page et al . ( 2000)@xcite estimated the cooling of hybrid neutron stars ( hns ) where heat transport effects within the superconducting quark core have been disregarded .",
    "neutrino mean free path in color superconducting quark matter have been discussed in @xcite where a short period of cooling delay at the onset of color superconductivity for a qs has been conjectured in accordance with the estimates of @xcite in the cfl case for small gaps .",
    "a completely new situation might arise if the scenarios suggested for ( color ) superconductivity @xcite besides of bigger pairing gaps ( @xmath5 mev ) will allow also small diquark pairing gaps ( @xmath6 mev ) in quark matter .",
    "the questions which should be considered within these models are the following : ( i ) is strange quark matter relevant for structure and evolution of compact stars ? ( ii ) are stable hybrid stars with quark matter interior possible ? ( iii ) what can we learn about possible csc phases from neutron star cooling ?",
    "further on in this lectures we discuss the scheme and the results of realization of the these points in relation with the cooling evolution of compact objects .    in the consideration of the scenario for the thermal evolution of ns and hns",
    "we include the heat transport in both the quark and the hadronic matter .",
    "we will demonstrate the influence of the diquark pairing gaps and the hadronic gaps on the evolution of the surface temperature .",
    "the main strategy of the simulation of the cooling evolution of compact objects is presented in fig [ scheme ] . on the top of scheme",
    "we have the general theoretical background of qcd models as it has been discussed in the introduction . on the second level of the scheme we separate two branches one for the structure of the compact objects and the other for the thermal properties of the stellar matter . on the bottom of the scheme",
    "those two branches are combined in the code of the cooling simulations project and entail the comparison of the theoretical and observational results .",
    "for the modeling of the dense hadronic matter different approaches , like relativistic and non - relativistic brckner - hartree - fock approach including the three body correlations @xcite and different parameterizations of relativistic mean field models , are discussed successfully in the literature @xcite .    for the appropriate cooling simulations we exploit the eos of @xcite ( specifically the argonne @xmath7 model ) , which is based on the most recent models for the nucleon - nucleon interaction including a parameterized three - body force and relativistic boost corrections .",
    "actually we adopt a simple analytic parameterization of this model by heiselberg and hjorth - jensen @xcite , hereafter hhj .",
    "the latter uses the compressional part with the compressibility @xmath8  mev , a symmetry energy fitted to the data around nuclear saturation density and smoothly incorporates causality at high densities .",
    "the density dependence of the symmetry energy is very important since it determines the value of the threshold density for the du process .",

    "anyhow , in the given nlw model the threshold density for the du process is @xmath17 .",
    "the quark matter models  @xcite predict , that the diquark pairing condensate is possible for temperatures and densities relevant for compact objects .",
    "the order of magnitude of pairing gaps is 100 mev and a remarkably rich phase structure of the matter has been identified  @xcite .",
    "this leads to expectations of observable effects of color superconducting phases , particularly in the compact star cooling behaviour  @xcite .",
    "generally color superconductivity is involved in all aspects of neutron star studies , such as magnetic field evolution  @xcite or burst - type phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the applications of the nonlocal chiral quark model developed in @xcite for the case of neutron star constraints shows that the relevant csc phase is a 2sc phase while the omission of the strange quark flavor is justified by the fact that chemical potentials in central parts of the stars do barely reach the threshold value at which the mass gap for strange quarks breaks down and they appear in the system @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in that work that the gaussian formfactor ansatz of quark interaction ( hereafter we call it sm model ) leads to an early onset of the deconfinement transition and such a model is therefore suitable to discuss hybrid stars with large quark matter cores @xcite .",
    "the resulting quark matter eos within this nonlocal chiral model @xcite can be represented in a form reminiscent of a bag model @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the ideal gas pressure of quarks and @xmath20 a _ density dependent _ bag pressure , see fig .",

    "@xcite disregarded finite size effects , such as surface tension and charge screening . on the example of the hadron - quark mixed phase refs @xcite demonstrated that finite size effects might play a crucial role substantially narrowing the region of the mixed phase or even forbidding its appearance in a hybrid star configuration .",

    "we will shortly summarize the results on hadronic cooling .    in framework of a",
    " minimal cooling ",
    "scenario , the pair breaking and formation ( pbf ) processes may allow to cover an  intermediate cooling ",
    "group of data ( even if one artificially suppressed medium effects)@xcite .",
    "these processes are very efficient for large pairing gaps and temperatures being not much less than the value of the gap .",
    "gaps , which we have adopted in the framework of the  nuclear medium cooling  scenario , see @xcite , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - gaps ] .",
    "thick dashed lines show proton gaps which were used in the work of @xcite performed in the framework of the `` standard plus exotics '' scenario .",
    "we will call the choice of the `` 3nt '' model from @xcite the model i. thin lines show @xmath249 proton and @xmath195 neutron gaps from @xcite , for the model av18 by @xcite ( we call it the model ii ) .",
    "recently @xcite has argued for a strong suppression of the @xmath195 neutron gaps , down to values @xmath250 kev , as the consequence of the medium - induced spin - orbit interaction .",
    "these findings motivated @xcite to suppress values of @xmath195 gaps shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - gaps ] by an extra factor @xmath251 .",
    "further possible suppression of the @xmath195 gap is almost not reflected on the behavior of the cooling curves .",
    "contrary to expectations of @xcite a more recent work of @xcite argued that the @xmath195 neutron pairing gap should be dramatically enhanced , as the consequence of the strong softening of the pion propagator . according to their estimate , the @xmath195 neutron pairing gap is as large as @xmath252  mev in a broad region of densities , see fig . 1 of their work .",
    "thus results of calculations of @xcite and @xcite , which both had the same aim to include medium effects in the evaluation of the @xmath195 neutron gaps , are in a deep discrepancy with each other .    * including superfluid gaps we see , in agreement with recent microscopic findings of @xcite , that the @xmath195 neutron gap should be as small as @xmath253  kev or less .",
    "so the `` nuclear medium cooling '' scenario of @xcite supports results of @xcite and fails to appropriately fit the neutron star cooling data when a strong enhancement of the @xmath195 neutron gaps is assumed as shown by @xcite .",
    "* medium effects associated with the pion softening are called for by the data . as the result of the pion softening",
    "the pion condensation may occur for @xmath254 ( @xmath255 in our model ) .",
    "its appearance at such rather high densities does not contradict to the cooling data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig21bgv ] ) , but also the data are well described using the pion softening but without assumption on the pion condensation .",
    "the similar argumentation holds also for du threshold density .",
    "that puts restrictions on the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "both statements might be important in the discussion of the heavy ion collision experiments .",
    "* we demonstrated a regular mass dependence for neutron stars with masses @xmath256 , where less massive neutron stars cool down slower and more massive neutron stars cool faster .",
    "this feature is more general and concerning also to hybrid stars @xcite .      for the calculation of the cooling of the quark core in the hybrid star we use the model @xcite .",
    "we incorporate the most efficient processes : the quark direct urca ( qdu ) processes on unpaired quarks , the quark modified urca ( qmu ) , the quark bremsstrahlung ( qb ) , the electron bremsstrahlung ( eb ) , and the massive gluon - photon decay ( see @xcite ) . following @xcite",
    "we include the emissivity of the quark pair formation and breaking ( qpfb ) processes , too .",
    "the specific heat incorporates the quark contribution , the electron contribution and the massless and massive gluon - photon contributions .",
    "the heat conductivity contains quark , electron and gluon terms .",
    "the calculations are based on the hadronic cooling scenario presented in fig .",
    "[ fig21bgv ] and we add the contribution of the quark core . for the gaussian form - factor",
    "the quark core occurs already for @xmath257 according to the model @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] .",
    "most of the relevant neutron star configurations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig21bgv ] ) are then affected by the presence of the quark core .",
    "first we check the possibility of the 2sc+ normal quark phases , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cool-2sc ] .",
    "the variation of the gaps for the strong pairing of quarks within the 2sc phase and the gluon - photon mass in the interval @xmath258mev only slightly affects the results .",
    "the main cooling process is the qdu process on normal quarks .",
    "we see that the presence of normal quarks entails too fast cooling .",
    "the data could be explained only , if all the masses lie in a very narrow interval ( @xmath259 in our case ) . in case of the other two crust models",
    "the resulting picture is similar .",
    "the existence of only a very narrow mass interval , in which the data can be fitted seems to us unrealistic by itself .",
    "moreover the observations show existence of neutron stars in binary systems with very different masses , e.g. , @xmath260 and @xmath261 , cf .",
    "_ thus the data ca nt be satisfactorily explained . _",
    "then we assume a possibility of an yet unknown x - pairing channel with a small @xmath262 gap and first check the case @xmath262 to be constant . for @xmath263mev",
    "the cooling is too slow @xcite .",
    "this is true for all three crust models .",
    "thus the gaps for formerly unpaired quarks should be still smaller in order to obtain a satisfactory description of the cooling data .    for the @xmath264 kev the cooling data can be fitted but have a very fragile dependence on the gravitational mass of the configuration .",
    "namely , we see that all data points , except the vela , cta 1 and geminga , correspond to hybrid stars with masses in the narrow interval @xmath265    therefore we would like to explore whether a density - dependent x - gap could allow a description of the cooling data within a larger interval of compact star masses .",
    "we employ an ansatz for the x - gap as a decreasing function of the chemical potential @xmath266~,\\ ] ] where the parameters are chosen such that at the critical quark chemical potential @xmath267 mev the onset of the deconfinement phase transition for the x - gap has its maximal value of @xmath268 mev and at the highest attainable chemical potential @xmath269 mev , i.e. in the center of the maximum mass hybrid star configuration , it falls to a value of the order of @xmath270 kev .",
    "we choose the value @xmath271 for which @xmath272 kev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool - csl - x - tt ] we show the resulting cooling curves for the gap model ii with gap ansatz eq .",
    "( [ gap ] ) , which we consider as the most realistic one .",
    "we observe that the mass interval for compact stars which obeys the cooling data is constrained between @xmath273 for slow coolers and @xmath274 for fast coolers such as vela .",
    "this results we obtain are based on a purely hadronic model with different choices of the parameters @xcite .",
    "note that according to a recently suggested independent test of cooling models @xcite by comparing results of a corresponding population synthesis model with the log n - log s distribution of nearby isolated x - ray sources the cooling model i did not pass the test .",
    "thereby it would be interesting to see , whether our quark model within the gap ansatz ii could pass the log n - log s test .",
    "in this lecture devoted to the modern problems of the cooling evolution of neutron stars we have discussed different successful scenarios aiming to explain the known temperature - age data from observations of compact objects . using up today known theoretical and experimental constraints on the structure and cooling regulators of compact star we end up with alternative explanations .",
    "the neutron star can be either pure hadronic or hybrid one with a quark core in superconducting state of matter .",
    "* within a nonlocal , chiral quark model the critical densities for a phase transition to color superconducting quark matter can be low enough for these phases to occur in compact star configurations with masses below @xmath275 .",
    "* for the choice of the gaussian form - factor the 2sc quark matter phase arises at @xmath276 . * without a residual pairing the 2sc quark matter phase could describe the cooling data only if compact stars had masses in a very narrow band around the critical mass for which the quark core can occur .",
    "* under assumption that formally unpaired quarks can be paired with small gaps @xmath277mev ( 2sc+x pairing ) , which values we varied in wide limits , only for density dependent gaps the cooling data can be appropriately fitted .",
    "so the present day cooling data could be still explained by hybrid stars , assuming a complex pairing pattern , where quarks are partly strongly paired within the 2sc channel , and partly weakly paired with gaps @xmath278mev , which are rapidly decrease with an increase of the density",
