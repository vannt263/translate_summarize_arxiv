    "a large number of real world phenomena exhibit strong or weak discontinuities .",
    "the application we have in mind is multiphase flow with kinks in the velocity field and jumps in the pressure field as well as in physical parameters , such as viscosity , across interfaces that evolve with time and may undergo topological changes .",
    "when simulating such phenomena , discontinuities can occur anywhere relative to a fixed background mesh .",
    "unfortunately , standard finite element methods , as well as finite difference schemes , do not accurately model discontinuities that are not _ a priori _ fitted to the mesh .",
    "however , letting the mesh conform to the interfaces requires remeshing as the interfaces evolve with time , and leads to significant complications when topological changes such as drop - breakup or coalescence occur .",
    "numerous strategies have been proposed to handle these difficulties .",
    "a common strategy has been to regularize the discontinuities  @xcite . however , this strategy has the drawback that it gives reduced accuracy near the interfaces and consequently requires a very fine mesh in these regions .",
    "methods that allow for discontinuities along interfaces that do not align with the mesh , and hence avoid both regularization and remeshing processes , have become highly attractive and significant efforts have been directed to their development , see e.g.  @xcite . in the finite element framework the extended finite element method ( xfem ) , where the finite element space is enriched so that discontinuities can be captured  @xcite , has become a popular alternative .",
    "however , in xfem the conditioning of the problem is sensitive to the position of the interface .",
    "whenever the interface cuts an element in such a way that the ratio between the areas / volumes on one and the other side of the interface becomes very large , the system may become ill - conditioned . in such cases , iterative linear solvers may breakdown . for unsteady problems",
    "it is not unusual that such situations occur . in  @xcite , this problem is addressed by neglecting basis functions in the xfem space that have very small support and may cause ill - conditioning .",
    "the criterion for the selection of basis functions to neglect then has to be chosen carefully so that accuracy is not lost .",
    "an alternative to the xfem approach is based on an extension of nitsche s method  @xcite for the weak enforcement of essential boundary conditions .",
    "this approach was first proposed for an elliptic interface problem in  @xcite and later for a stokes interface problem in  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to construct the discrete solution from separate solutions defined on each subdomain separated by the interface and at the interface enforce the jump conditions weakly using a variant of nitsche s method . by choosing the coefficients in the nitsche numerical fluxes locally on each element and letting them",
    "depend on the relative area / volume of each side of the interface the unfitted finite element methods in  @xcite can allow for discontinuities internal to the elements with optimal convergence order .",
    "however , these methods suffer from ill - conditioning just as xfem . in  @xcite and later in  @xcite a stabilization of the classical nitsche s method for the imposition of dirichlet boundary conditions on a boundary not fitted to the mesh was considered for the poisson problem and for the stokes equation , respectively . in these methods",
    "the stabilization is applied in the boundary region and optimal convergence order and well conditioned system matrices are ensured . for the elliptic interface problem",
    "other stabilization strategies have been suggested as remedies to the ill - conditioning problem , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for implementation aspects in three dimensions and @xcite for extensions to higher order elements .    in this paper ,",
    "we propose a robust finite element method which offers a way to accurately and with control of the condition number of the system matrix solve the stokes interface problem involving two immiscible fluids with different viscosities and surface tension .",
    "the model consists of the incompressible stokes equations in two subdomains each occupied by a fluid .",
    "differences in viscosity between the fluids and the surface tension force poses jump conditions at the interface separating the fluids .",
    "the finite element method we propose for this stokes interface problem enforces the jump conditions at the interface weakly with weighted coefficients in the nitsche numerical fluxes .",
    "we also suggest slight changes to the variational formulation in  @xcite to reduce spurious velocity oscillations and we include stabilization terms both for the velocity and the pressure that guarantee a well conditioned system matrix .",
    "the stabilization terms are consistent least squares terms controlling the jump in the normal gradient across faces between elements in a neighbourhood of the interface . using the stabilization terms",
    "we prove an inf - sup condition and that the resulting stiffness matrix has optimal conditioning .",
    "we also prove the inf - sup stability of the method under the condition that the mean value of the pressure in the entire domain is fixed , in contrast to the inf - sup result in  @xcite which is based on the more restrictive condition that the mean values in each of the two subdomains are fixed .",
    "our inf - sup result is also uniform with respect to the jump in the viscosity .",
    "the proposed method is simple to implement as it uses standard continuous linear basis functions with changes only in the variational form .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we formulate the stokes system and the finite element method . in section 3",
    "we prove that the method is of optimal convergence order . in section 4",
    "we prove that the condition number is @xmath0 independent of the position of the interface relative to the mesh .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we show numerical examples in two space dimensions and compare the method to existing methods .",
    "we summarize our results in section 7 .",
    "we consider a problem consisting of two immiscible fluids separated by an interface , with the flow described by the incompressible stokes equations . the stokes system is a standard model for creeping viscous flow . in this section",
    "we present the equations and a finite element method for their approximate solution .",

    "we consider the following stokes interface boundary value problem modeling two fluids with different viscosity and with surface tension : find the velocity @xmath9 and the pressure @xmath10 such that    [ strongform ] @xmath11    here @xmath12 is the strain tensor , @xmath13 on @xmath14 is a piecewise constant viscosity function on the partition @xmath15 , @xmath16 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] are given functions , @xmath18 is the surface tension coefficient , @xmath19 is the curvature of the interface , @xmath20 is the unit normal to @xmath21 , outward - directed with respect to @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , where @xmath24    we assume a constant surface tension coefficient @xmath18 .",
