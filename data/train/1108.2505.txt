    "most , if not all , minor planet populations are host to multiple systems , including binaries and trinaries ( see walsh 2009 for review ) . these multiples have a vast array of properties , from extremely short - period , contact binaries , to systems that are exceedingly widely separated and have mutual periods of many years . some have tiny satellites , thought to be collisional fragments blown off of their parent , and others have components of near - equal size and mass .",
    "the characteristics of these systems represent a treasure trove of information about the properties of the objects that compose them , the environment they are embedded in , and the dynamical history of their parent population . through their orbital separations and periods , binaries offer the only way to measure the mass of these distant objects , which when combined with radius measurements determine these objects bulk densities  which in turn provide information about composition and physical structure ( such as porosity ) .    in the last 10 years",
    ", trans - neptunian populations have been found to host to a very high fraction of binary systems .",
    "the binary fraction varies in sub - populations from @xmath8% in the low - inclination component of the classical kuiper belt to just a few percent in other dynamical classes ( noll et al . 2008a ) . given the low interaction rates of the kuiper belt populations today , forming",
    "such a large number of binary systems has proven a theoretical challenge , especially with the limited information available for the components of these systems ( eg .",

    "trans - neptunian binaries ( tnbs ) are distinguished from binary systems elsewhere in the solar system by the high frequency of near - equal sized binaries , and by the presence of binaries with extremely wide separations and long mutual - orbit periods . widely - separated , long - period tnbs are difficult to create and very sensitive to perturbation ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2011 , parker & kavelaars 2010 , petit & mousis 2004 ) , and make valuable tracers of the dynamical and collisional conditions over the history of the outer solar system .",
    "the orbital , compositional and statistical properties of these binaries constrain the total mass and dynamical history of the various populations , with important implications for theories of solar system formation and evolution .",
    "there are several dozen known tnbs , but only a small subset has measured orbital parameters ( noll et al .",
    "2008b , naoz et al .",
    "2010 , grundy et al .",
    "2011 ) . most of these , in turn , are relatively tightly - bound binaries that have been characterized by observations from space ( systems with mutual semi - major axis much less than 5% of their hill radius , eg . , grundy et al .",
    "2009 & 2011 ) .",
    "two tnb systems with moderately widely - separated components have published mutual orbits ( 1998 ww@xmath9 and teharonhiawako / sawiskera , both with mutual semi - major axes of order 5% of their hill radius ) , but the widest tnbs ( those with mutual semi - major axes substantially exceeding 5% of their hill sphere ) have not been well - characterized to date , with a preliminary orbit estimate available only for the system 2001 qw@xmath2 ( petit et al .",
    "2008 ) . such wide - separation , near - equal mass binaries all have low heliocentric inclinations , indicating that they belong to the cold component of the classical kuiper belt .",
    "these wide binaries make up at least 1.5% of the known cold classical belt objects ( lin et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the creation of large - separation , near - equal mass binaries is most likely during the formation phase of tnos , as most proposed formation scenarios require a much higher space density of objects than is observed today .",
    "additionally , most tnbs have identically - colored components , with differences between primary and secondary color being much smaller than the large color variation seen across the entire population of tnos ( benecchi et al .",
    "this suggests that each component formed from similar material in a similar region of a locally homogeneous protoplanetary disk with global variations in composition .",
    "different mechanisms proposed for binary formation dominate under different dynamical conditions ( eg .",
    ", schlichting & sari 2008a ) . if the dynamical properties of the systems today can be taken to be representative of their primordial distribution , they can probe the dynamical conditions of the primordial kuiper belt during the formation phase .",
    "however , any intervening violent dynamical events , such as collisions ( petit & mousis 2004 , nesvorn et al .",
    "2011 ) or close encounters with giant planets ( parker & kavelaars 2010 ) can leave today s mutual orbit distribution substantially altered from its original state .",
    "it is critical to measure the orbital properties of a large sample of tnbs , as well as perform dynamical studies of possible sources of orbital modification , in order to understand the full extent of information about the formation and history of the outer solar system encoded in these systems .",
    "we have collected astrometric measurements of a sample of seven of the widest - known tnbs for an extended period , covering four to nine years of orbital motion for each system .",
    "these observations have allowed us to compute accurate mutual orbits for our sample of ultra - wide tnbs , and from these orbits we derive system mass and a host of other characteristics . in the first part of this paper",
    ", we outline the nomenclature we adopt to describe these systems and their host populations (  1.1 ) , our sample selection criteria (  2 ) , details of our observational campaign and data reduction techniques (  3 ) , and mutual orbit fitting algorithm (  4 ) . in the latter part",
    ", we describe the mutual orbit fits (  5 ) and compare them to the properties of other binary populations , and derive geometric albedos for each system given reasonable assumptions of bulk density (  6 ) .",
    "finally , we conclude with a discussion of possible formation mechanisms and implications for the early history of the outer solar system , susceptibility of these systems to disruption by collisions and neptune scattering , and present future surveys abilities to discover and characterize a large sample of these ultra - wide tnbs .      in this paper ,",
    "we compare several sub - populations of trans - neptunian objects and their various orbital properties . in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the nomenclature we use to describe these populations and their properties , we provide an outline here .",
    "a binary s mutual orbit properties will be described either as a `` mutual '' property or denoted by the subscript `` @xmath10 . '' in contrast , the properties of the orbit of the binary s barycenter around the sun will be described as an `` outer '' property or denoted by the subscript `` out . ''    in order to compare the properties of our sample with those in the literature , some dynamical classification is required .",
    "we adhere roughly to the gladman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) nomenclature when discussing outer orbit properties . in this paper",
    ", we frequently deal with binaries that belong to the following dynamical classes :    * `` classical : '' non - resonant objects in the range 34 au@xmath11 au , 37 au @xmath12 au . * `` cold classical : '' subset of `` classical '' objects with low orbital excitations and confined in semi - major axis . when dividing samples , we assign `` classical '' binaries with @xmath13 , @xmath14 au , and 42.4 @xmath15 au to this population .",
    "referred to as cc population in the text .",
    "* `` hot classical : '' subset of `` classical '' objects with higher mean orbital excitations , and an extension to lower pericenter than the cc population .",
    "when dividing samples , we assign `` classical '' binaries with @xmath16 , @xmath17 au , @xmath18 or @xmath19 au to this population .",
    "referred to as hc population in the text .",
    "this dynamical classification is somewhat different from that adopted by grundy et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and several binaries in that work which were classified as `` extended scattered '' fall into our hc classification .",
    "in addition , we compare the outer orbital distributions of binary sub - samples with the canada - france ecliptic plane survey ( cfeps ) l7 synthetic model of the kuiper belt . we compare the cc binary sub - sample with the composite of the `` stirred '' and `` kernel '' sub - components of the synthetic kuiper belt model , and refer to the composite of these sub - components as cc - l7 .",
    "we compare the hc binary sub - sample with the `` hot '' sub - component of the synthetic kuiper belt model , and refer to this sub - component as hc - l7 .    in reality , any simple inclination cut is insufficient to determine which population a given object truly belongs to , as both the cc and hc populations overlap significantly .",
    "according to the cfeps l7 model , most relatively bright objects below @xmath20 of inclination actually belong to the hc - l7 population .",
    "we stress that while we will refer to a given object as a `` cc '' binary or an `` hc '' binary , there is no way to absolutely verify the parent population for a given single object .",
    "however , we show later that the sub - samples of binaries which fall into our cc and hc classifications have dynamically distinct mutual orbit distributions , and the outer orbit distributions of cc binaries suggest that they are in fact members of the cc - l7 population , and likewise the hc binaries outer orbit distribution is consistent with the hc - l7 distribution .",

    "was required due to the fact that most images were obtained with sidereal tracking rates , and over the period of integration the psf of the binary s components became somewhat stretched along their direction of motion .",
    "a variant of the same algorithm used for fitting the mutual binary orbits ( described in the following section ) was used to minimize the residuals in a sky - subtracted 40@xmath4840 pixel region centered on the binary .",
    "an initial interactive step is used to identify all the point sources in this region and flag the two associated with the binary .",
    "initial estimates for the amplitude and @xmath49 of the psf are made automatically , and these values are fed into a markov - chain monte carlo algorithm which finds the psf model and array of point source positions and amplitudes that produces the smallest residuals . because the image model varies with the number of point sources in the 40@xmath4840 pixel region , the minimum number of free parameters the algorithm must search over is 9 ( two point sources , and a two - component psf model forced to be circular ) while the maximum number of free parameters ever treated was 22 ( five point sources and a two - component psf model with arbitrary rotation and ellipticity for each component ) .",

    "fits with the elongated psf would occasionally have trouble converging to a stable solution , and in these cases we adopted the values from the circular psf fits .",
    "we did not attempt to determine any upper limits on separation based on completely unresolved images , and therefore at present such images do not contribute to our mutual orbit fits .",
    "relative astrometry was recorded as separation ( in arcseconds ) and position angle ( in degrees east of north ) , and the observation date was taken at the central julian date of each observation .",

    "relatively few observations were made in photometric conditions , as image quality was our primary concern .",

    "the basic operations performed by our mutual - orbit fitting routine are , given an initial guess of mutual orbit properties , to solve kepler s equation in order to determine the relative system geometry at the time of observation ( accounting for the light - time delay between the system and observer ) , then rotate the system in space to account for its orientation with respect to the ecliptic .",
    "finally , the code `` observes '' the system by applying a second rotation to account for the variation in viewing geometry induced by the relative motion between the earth and the binary , and projects the result onto the sky plane given the separation between the observer and the system .",

    "the difference in inclination distributions between both populations could either be due to cosmogonic variations inherent in different formation mechanisms , or due to evolutionary processes .",
    "fabrycky & tremaine ( 2007 ) showed that tidal friction coupled with kozai oscillations can cause wide , high - inclination systems to shrink and become circularized , creating a paucity of widely - separated , high - inclination binaries , and an excess of tight binaries near the critical inclinations for kozai cycles ( @xmath302 and @xmath303 ) .",

    "we have refined these calculations and performed extensive numerical simulations of binary disruption by collisions , and will present the results of this work in an upcoming publication .",
    "the system 2000 cf@xmath4 has by far the shortest collisional lifetime , due to its wide separation and very small component sizes ; in fact , it is the second - widest known tnb ( with respect to @xmath69 ) and its components have the lowest mass of any tno currently measured .",
    "it can be unbound by the smallest impactors of all the binary systems considered here , and is therefore most sensitive to the impactor population at small sizes .",
    "the frequency of systems like 2000 cf@xmath4 in the current kuiper belt is therefore of considerable interest , as they act as powerful probes of the collisional environment .",
    "future surveys will likely identify many such systems , and we discuss the prospects for these surveys in the next section .      in the previous sections , we have found that the inclination distribution of the wide binaries indicates a very cold dynamical environment at the time of formation , but formation of the binaries post - accretion through the @xmath359 pathway  which should dominate in such conditions  can be ruled out due to a lack of preference for retrograde orientations .",
    "we also found that the cold classical kuiper belt was never subjected to a period of close encounters with neptune , and therefore likely formed in situ .",
    "finally , the properties of mutual orbits produced by current simulations of gravitational collapse are consistent with the observed properties of binaries in the cold classical kuiper belt .",
    "together , all these results suggest that formation of the cold classical kuiper belt occurred in situ , with objects forming via rapid collapse of small particles directly into large ( @xmath410 km ) planetesimals through primary accretion driven by turbulent concentration of solids in the protoplanetary disk ( eg . , johansen et al .",
    "2007 , cuzzi et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this process offers a mechanism for forming binaries such as are observed in this population , and can feasibly form the cold classical kuiper belt in situ ( cuzzi et al .",
    "2010 ) without requiring that a large fraction of the primordial mass in planetesimals be subsequently removed through either significant collisional grinding or dynamical processes ( both of which can be destructive to the binary population ) , even when the density of the primordial disk is required to drop sharply beyond 30 au to halt the early migration of neptune at its present distance .",
    "additionally , since this process produces no massive sea of small planetesimals ( most planetesimals being `` born big '' ) , the @xmath359 mechanism will naturally be ineffective , thus preventing it from forming a dominantly retrograde binary population in the dynamically cold environment indicated by the binaries low mutual inclinations",
    ".    the mechanism of binary formation by gravitational collapse should be extensively explored . if it can be shown to produce roughly equal numbers of prograde and retrograde binaries while maintaining a preference for low mutual inclinations , then this should be taken as strong support for the formation of the cold classical kuiper belt in situ by rapid primary accretion driven by turbulent concentration and gravitational collapse .      while the current sample of known ultra - wide tnbs",
    "remains fairly small , future wide - area surveys like the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) and pan - starrs will be quite capable of identifying such systems .",
    "the projected lsst @xmath411-band single - visit depth is @xmath412 , which translates to @xmath413 for a geocentric distance of 45 au . at this depth",
    ", there are roughly 17,000 objects in the cc - l7 component of the cfeps synthetic model of the kuiper belt . at a minimum , the results of lin et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggest that at least 1.5% of these objects are ultra - wide tnbs with characteristics like those in our sample , and we therefore expect over 250 such systems will be detectable by the lsst pipeline",
    ".    some fraction of the observations of each of these tnbs will likely be resolved , depending on the binary separation and the seeing at the time of each observation . in order to estimate this fraction of resolved observations",
    ", we have used clones of each binary in our sample to determine the distribution of on - sky separations that can be expected over the ten - year baseline of the lsst survey .",
    "we move each clone to a random starting point on both its heliocentric orbit and mutual orbits , then propagated its motion forward for ten years while sampling its on - sky separation at 100 `` observation epochs '' over than ten - year period . at every `` observation epoch '' we determined if the system was resolved or not based on its on - sky separation and an image quality drawn from the measured @xmath6-band distribution of seeing at the lsst site ( lsst science book version 2.0 , section 2.2 ) , with median seeing of @xmath414 .",
    "figure [ lsst ] illustrates the cumulative fraction @xmath415 of binary systems versus the minimum fraction of observations which resolve those systems .",
    "-band taken over the course of the 10-year lsst survey lifetime .",
    "an observation is said to be `` resolved '' when the full - width at half - max of the seeing during that observations is smaller than the projected binary separation.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the minimum fraction of resolved observations for any system we simulated was @xmath41618% , and the maximum was 100% .",
    "if we take the planned baseline number of 230 visits per field in the @xmath417band to represent the number of observations likely to be made of each binary , then we would expect @xmath41640230 resolved observations of each binary system .",
    "this indicates that virtually _ all _ 250 tnb systems with properties similar to those in our sample likely to be observed by the lsst will have more resolved observation epochs than the most - observed binary in our current data set ( 2001 qw@xmath2 , with 35 observed epochs ) . as such ,",
    "not only will lsst _ detect _ most of these binary systems , but it will measure their mutual orbit properties at least as well as we have managed to do with the sample presented in this paper .    with such a large catalog of well - characterized binary orbits , all drawn from the same well - calibrated survey , unprecedented avenues of investigation will be opened .",
    "identifying trends of binary properties with heliocentric orbit may provide further evidence for different origins and histories of the sub - components of the kuiper belt , and will provide new constraints on the dynamical history of the outer solar system ( parker & kavelaars 2010 , murray - clay & schlichting 2011 ) , trends of binary fraction with component sizes will constrain the extent of collisional grinding in the early kuiper belt ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2011 ) , and color  albedo trends may be identified and used to constrain the surface composition of these objects .",
    "we have presented the first - ever well - characterized mutual orbits for a sample of seven ultra - wide trans - neptunian binaries .",
    "these orbits range over eccentricities from @xmath418 , and have semi - major axis to hill radius ( @xmath69 ) fractions ranging from @xmath419 .",
    "we find that their properties are distinct from other binary populations , with the following highlights :    1 .",
    "the outer orbits of all widely - separated binaries ( @xmath260 ) with near - equal mass components ( @xmath261 , or @xmath420 ) are distributed consistently with being drawn from the `` stirred '' and `` kernel '' components of the cfeps l7 synthetic model of the kuiper belt , and inconsistent with being drawn from the low - inclination subset of the `` hot '' component .",
    "this confirms that only the dynamically cold components of the classical kuiper belt are host to wide binaries .",
    "two ultra - wide tnbs have very high mutual eccentricities ( @xmath421 0.84 and 0.9 ) consistent with the predictions of binary formation by exchange reactions ( funato et al .",
    "2004 ) , but the rest are inconsistent with the extreme eccentricities predicted by this mechanism .",
    "ultra - wide tnbs have roughly equal numbers of prograde and retrograde orbits , and the observed ratio is inconsistent with the predicted preference for retrograde orbits if the @xmath359 binary formation mechanism dominated unless over @xmath422% of wide binary systems have switched orientations over their lifetimes .",
    "ultra - wide tnbs have a statistically significantly different mutual inclination distribution compared to tighter binaries in literature , and their inclinations also can not have been drawn from a uniform sphere ( @xmath291 ) due to a lack of detections of high - mutual inclination wide binaries .",
    "this paucity of wide binaries at high inclinations and preference for low inclinations can not be explained by the kctf mechanism alone , and suggests a primordial preference for low - inclination mutual orbits .",
    "this suggests formation in a very dynamically cold disk .",
    "the wide separations of these systems indicates that if binary formation was dominated by the @xmath360 mechanism , the velocity dispersion in the primordial disk must have been less than a few times the hill velocity .",
    "a low velocity dispersion supports the observed preference for low mutual inclinations .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion could not have been much below the hill velocity or the @xmath359 mechanism would have dominated and the ultra - wide binaries should exhibit a strong preference for retrograde orbits .",
    "thus , under the assumption that these are the only two efficient formation pathways , it appears that @xmath369 .",
    "further modeling of these mechanisms is required to determine whether a balance can be struck between them where widely - separated binaries can be formed with aligned poles and roughly equal numbers of prograde and retrograde orientations .",
    "current simulations of the alternative formation mechanism of gravitational collapse and fragmentation ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2010 ) create orbital distributions similar to the observed present - day distributions .",
    "these simulations tend to over - produce wide systems , which leaves some room for post - formation disruption of ultra - wide binaries .",
    "however , it remains unclear if this mechanism can produce a large number of retrograde systems .",
    "7 .   assuming realistic densities , the implied albedos for the ultra - wide tnbs range over @xmath423 , consistent with estimates of the albedos of solitary cold classical objects ( eg .",
    ", brucker et al .",
    "the distribution of observed albedos with primary radius for all dynamically - cold tnbs ( seven from this work and four others from literature ) suggests that albedos at the lower end of this scale are intrinsically more common in this population . a gaussian albedo distribution , centered at @xmath352 and clipped such that @xmath424 , is consistent with observations for widths @xmath425 .",
    "this estimate does not account for the possibility that binary fraction might vary substantially with primary radius as predicted by nesvorn et al .",
    "all seven systems characterized in this work are widely separated enough to have a substantial probability of disruption if ever subjected to close encounters with neptune ( parker & kavelaars 2010 ) , suggestive of _ in situ _ formation or a more gentle migration mechanism .",
    "additionally , the collisional lifetimes of these binary systems are short if the size distribution of the kuiper belt is steep ( @xmath426 ) at small sizes ; for the present population of binaries to have survived for the age of the solar system requires that they were never subjected to a period of intense collisional grinding ( eg . , petit & mousis 2004 , nesvorn et al .",
    "2011 ) and that significant collisions have remained relatively rare in the kuiper belt over the age of the solar system .",
    "we explore the collisional evolution of these binary systems and further constrain the collisional environment of the present - day kuiper belt in an upcoming paper . 9 .",
    "a confluence of results  _ ( a ) _ gravitational collapse producing similar binary properties as are observed , _ ( b ) _ the evidence that the cold classical kuiper belt was not subjected to a period of close encounters with neptune , and _",
    "( c ) _ the mutual orbits of the wide binaries suggesting formation in a very dynamically - cold environment , yet the @xmath359 mechanism not dominating the binary formation process  all suggest that the cold classical kuiper belt formed in situ through rapid accretion of small particles directly into large ( @xmath410 km ) planetesimals , driven by turbulent concentration of solids and gravitational collapse .",
