    "since kaluza and klein @xcite found that the electromagnetic and gravitational forces can be unified by introducing the fifth dimension , their idea has attracted attention for many decades .",
    "recently , there have been a lot of renewed interests in field theories with extra dimensions , in which the length scale of the extra dimensions can be so large that they could be experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "it is assumed there that for distances larger than the compactification size , the massive kaluza - klein excitations decouple so that these theories behave as a four - dimensional continuum theory at low energies . since ,",
    "however , yang - mills theories in more than four dimensions are nonrenormalizable , it is not at all clear that the infinite tower of the kaluza - klein excitations decouple even if each massive excitation is suppressed : a naive expectation of their contribution would be @xmath7 .    at four dimensions ,",
    "the color degrees of freedom are confined even for a weak gauge coupling .",
    "how can a confining four - dimensional yang - mills theory emerge from a higher - dimensional yang - mills theory which is deconfining in the weak coupling regime @xcite ?",
    "although the assumption on the decoupling of the kaluza - klein excitations sounds physically correct , it is by no means trivial that they nonperturbatively decouple in such a way that the color confinement takes place even at a weak gauge coupling .",
    "recently , we @xcite have started to address related problems in a concrete example , namely the pure lattice @xmath0 yang - mills theory in five dimensions with one dimension compactified on a circle .",
    "we have observed @xcite that the compactification changes the nature of the phase transition , and that a second order phase transition , which does not exist in the uncompactified case , occurs , thus confirming the long - standing expectation of lang , pilch and skagerstam@xcite .",
    "for the first time , we @xcite have computed the lattice @xmath8-function in a yang - mills theory in more than four dimensions , and have verified nonperturbatively the power - law running of the gauge coupling constant @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to extend the analyses of @xcite .",
    "we first observe that if the compactification radius becomes smaller and smaller , the confining phase spreads more and more to the weak coupling regime . at the same time",
    "we compute the effective dimension @xcite , and see that the theory behaves more and more as a four - dimensional yang - mills theory . based on this result ,",
    "we argue that the color degrees of freedom in qcd are confined only for @xmath5 . our rough estimate yields that @xmath6 lies in the tev range .    our calculations of the potential between two static quarks separated in the four - dimensional subspace show that the deconfining phase is a coulomb phase .",
    "we then discuss the nature of the transition from the deconfining phase to the confining phase for fixed values of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the lattice spacing in the four - dimensional direction .",
    "we confirm that if @xmath3 is small enough , it is consistent with a second order transition .",
    "combined with the result of @xcite , we therefore come to the conclusion that as we decrease the value of @xmath9 , the first order transition for large values of @xmath9 changes to a cross over transition , and finally becomes of second order .",
    "we give some nonperturbative comments on deconstructing extra dimensions @xcite in conclusion .",
    "in order to take into account the compactification effects in this theory , it is crucial to use anisotropic lattices @xcite which has different lattice spacings , @xmath4 and @xmath10 , in the four - dimensional directions and in the fifth direction . for definiteness",
    "we employ the wilson action for pure @xmath0 lattice gauge theory @xmath11 + \\beta \\gamma~\\sum_{p_5}~[~ 1-\\frac{1}{2}~\\mbox{re tr}~ u_{p_5}~]~ , \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 denote plaquette variables in the four - dimensional sublattice , and @xmath13 are those which are extended in the fifth dimension .",
    "the gauge coupling constant @xmath14 has the dimension of @xmath15 , which is related to @xmath16 by @xmath17 at the tree level .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed in all directions , and we use the lattice size of the form @xmath18 ( we mostly use @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) . the compactification radius is defined as @xmath21 if @xmath22 is satisfied , and the correlation - anisotropy parameter is defined as @xmath23 . the tree level relation @xmath24 will be modified at the quantum level @xcite , and throughout this paper we assume that the @xmath25 relation obtained in @xcite is satisfied both in the confining and deconfining phases .",
    "simulations are performed for @xmath26 which is equivalent to @xcite @xmath27 where we have used @xmath20 above .",
    "we have chosen this range of @xmath28 , because we expect from the previous calculations @xcite that the limit @xmath29 may exist and we observe some scaling behavior .    to define the physical scale in the confining phase , we use the string tension @xmath30 between two static quarks that are separated in the four - dimensional subspace .",
    "since the string tension is a physical quantity , the lattice string tension @xmath31 should behave like @xmath32 as @xmath2 , where @xmath4 can be related by the @xmath8 function to the dimensionless bare gauge coupling @xmath33 where we have identified @xmath34 with @xmath35 because @xmath36 . since we expect that the massive kaluza - klein excitations decouple",
    "increasingly as @xmath28 decreases , the lattice @xmath8 function @xmath37 can not assume a purely five- or four - dimensional form .",
    "instead , we expect a continuous change of its form .",
    "this is quantitatively expressed by the so - called effective dimension @xmath38 which is a function of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "so , we assume that @xmath37 can be written as @xmath39~g^2-\\frac{2b}{16 \\pi^2}g^4~ , \\label{betal1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the evolution equation of @xmath41 can be easily integrated in the case that @xmath28 is kept fixed while @xmath4 changes .",
    "we obtain for this case @xmath42 it is important to notice that as @xmath43 , we obtain the logarithmic form @xmath44 that is , if we can show that the effective dimension @xmath38 in the confining phase varies from @xmath45 to @xmath46 as @xmath28 decreases from a larger value to a smaller value , we show the continuous decoupling of the kaluza - klein excitations , and the confining phase spreads more and more to the weak coupling regime as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "now we come to the results of our monte carlo simulations on a @xmath47 lattice .",
    "we use the creutz ratio @xmath48 obtained from the rectangular wilson loops @xmath49 with lengths of @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the four - dimensional subspace .",
    "we assume that the creutz ratio takes the form @xmath52 and we identity @xmath53 with the lattice string tension @xmath31 .",
    "we have generated 2500 configurations for each simulation point after thermalization , and the wilson loops are measured every 5 configurations for the calculation of a creutz ratio .",
    "errors are estimated by the jackknife method . the filled symbols in fig .",
    "1 are the result obtained from the monte carlo simulations with @xmath54 , where the vertical axis stands for @xmath55 and the horizontal axis stands for @xmath56 .",
    "we have also calculated @xmath31 from the static potential to make it sure that @xmath31 obtained from the creutz ratios is reliable .",
    "the static potential we have assumed has the form @xmath57\\right ) + c_3x~ , \\label{st - pot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 $ ] is the three - dimensional coulomb potential on a lattice , and is given by @xmath59= 4\\pi\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\frac{\\exp\\{i\\sum_ix_i\\sin(p_i/2)\\}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\sin^2(p_i/2)}~. \\label{3dcoulomb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the open symbols in fig .",
    "1 correspond to the result obtained from the static potential . comparing two results in fig .  1 we see that the lattice string tensions obtained from the creutz ratios agree with those obtained from the static potential .",
    "we have made the same comparison for different values of @xmath60 , and found the same result .",
    "so , in the following analyses we use only the lattice string tensions from the creutz ratio , because we have more data for this case and we do not want to mix data obtained by two different methods .",
    "we see from fig .  1 that above @xmath61 the square root of the lattice string tension @xmath62 decreases first linearly until @xmath63 , and then its slope becomes milder .",
    "the tail for large @xmath8 is certainly due to the finite lattice size effects , but the change from the linear decrease of @xmath62 to a milder one around @xmath63 may indicate that the theoretical expectation ( [ deff ] ) is correct .",
    "although it is in principle possible to check by increasing the lattice size how much finite lattice size effects may be contained in the tail of @xmath62 , it is impossible to do this at the moment because of the limitation of the computing facility given to us .",
    "below we sketch how we confirm eq .",
    "( [ deff ] ) and compute @xmath38 .",
    "the effective dimension can be obtained by fitting the function ( [ deff ] ) to the data . to this end",
    ", we first choose four neighboring data points that lie around the middle of the data set for a given @xmath60 , and using these points , we fit the function ( [ deff ] ) to obtain the effective dimension .",
    "( in the case for @xmath54 for instance , we use the data points at @xmath64 and @xmath65 . )",
    "then we increase the number of the data points , to be used , by two by including the next neighboring data point in both sides . in doing so",
    ", we obtain the effective dimension and also @xmath66 as a function of the number @xmath67 of the data points that are used for a fit .",
    "we repeat the same analysis for the different values of @xmath28 given in ( [ rovera ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  2 , 3 and in table i. in fig .  3 , the vertical axis stand for @xmath68 and",
    "the error bar is computed from @xmath66 .",
    "we see that as @xmath67 increases , the error bar decreases and the central values converge .",
    "the results are summarized in table i , and we see that the effective dimension @xmath38 decreases gradually from @xmath69 to @xmath70 as @xmath60 increases from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , which means , as @xmath28 decreases from @xmath73 to @xmath74 ( see ( [ rovera ] ) ) .",
    "the @xmath75 in table i is the value at which @xmath76 and hence @xmath4 should vanish if the theoretical assumption ( [ deff ] ) is correct and extrapolated for larger values of @xmath8 ( see also fig .  2 ) .",
    "we emphasize that our results indicate that the limit @xmath2 with @xmath3 kept fixed exists in the confining phase at finite @xmath8 .",
    "the same analysis in the real qcd in section iii would constrain the size of the compactification radius in qcd , which we would like to estimate without detailed calculations . to see that there exists the maximal radius for color confinement in the four - dimensional subspace",
    ", we recall the results obtained in the previous section and those from the next section : @xmath77 therefore , for a given value of @xmath38 , there should exist the smallest value of @xmath41 for color confinement to occur , which is @xmath78 .",
    "the question is how @xmath41 can be related to the gauge coupling @xmath79 of the kaluza - klein theory , the four - dimensional theory with the kaluza - klein tower . at the tree level , it is @xmath80 , but in higher orders this relation will receive quantum corrections , where we have used @xmath81 . to answer the question , we first assume that @xmath82 as @xmath83 , and we consider a redefinition of @xmath41 according to @xcite @xmath84 note that the @xmath8 function of @xmath85 becomes @xmath86 since the function @xmath87 becomes proportional to @xmath9 as @xmath88 , as a function of @xmath89 , which , however , depends on the regularization used @xcite",
    ". therefore , the lattice regularization does not reproduce the same coefficient @xcite obtained in @xcite . ]",
    "the new gauge coupling describes the power - law behavior @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we see from ( [ gkk ] ) that @xmath85 approaches @xmath41 as @xmath90 approaches @xmath91 .",
    "recalling now the assumption that @xmath38 approaches @xmath46 as @xmath9 approaches @xmath91 and eq . ( [ log ] ) , we see that the renormalization group flow of the new gauge coupling @xmath85 for small @xmath9 takes exactly the same form as the one for the effective , four - dimensional theory without the kaluza - klein tower . therefore , we assume that @xmath79 is the gauge coupling of the four - dimensional theory with the kaluza - klein tower .    now , suppose that qcd results from a five - dimensional qcd .",
    "as we have argued above , @xmath41 becomes @xmath79 at low energies , and we then identify @xmath92 with the physical scale @xmath34 of the effective theory , rather than with the ultraviolet cutoff . since @xmath93 in qcd and @xmath94 , the constraint ( [ condition ] )",
    "can be converted to that of the effective dimension , i.e. , @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , if we know the function @xmath96 exactly , we can calculate the range of @xmath89 for which the inequality ( [ condition ] ) is satisfied . from the result given in table",
    "i we find that the effective dimension as a function of @xmath89 can be written as @xmath97 . assuming that this function can be used even for small @xmath89 , we then obtain @xmath98 , which implies that @xmath99 should be satisfied for the color degrees of freedom in qcd to be confined .",
    "the number above should not be taken very seriously , because our estimate is based on many theoretical assumptions , which can be justified if we perform simulations on five - dimensional , compactified @xmath100 lattice gauge theory .",
    "the crucial point is that there exists the maximal radius .",
    "the confining phase shrinks as @xmath1 decreases , which we have already seen above . next we would like to show that the deconfining phase is a coulomb phase . to begin with",
    ", we consider the wilson loop @xmath101 at the tree level in continuum perturbation theory .",
    "the static potential can be obtained by @xmath102 we have the usual coulomb potential for @xmath103 , and we see that the dimensionless gauge coupling @xmath104 , normalized for the four - dimensional yang - mills theory at the tree level , is given by @xmath105 as well known @xcite .",
    "the corresponding expression on a lattice is @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a lattice wilson loop .",
    "the lattice distances @xmath108 and @xmath109 are made dimensionless by dividing by @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in the potential between two static quarks that are separated in four dimensions , and therefore , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are supposed to be in the four - dimensional sublattice . since in the actual calculations",
    "we can not take the limit @xmath110 , we consider also off - axis loops and use the standard smearing techniques @xcite to improve the convergence of approximants with increasing @xmath109 .",
    "our smearing procedure consists of iteratively replacing each spatial ( three - dimensional ) link by the sum of itself and the neighboring four spatial staples with a weight parameter @xmath111 , @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes a projection operator , back onto the @xmath0 manifold .",
    "we have generated 10000 configurations for each simulation point after thermalization , and the smeared wilson loops are measured every 100 configurations for the calculation of the static potential .",
    "we iterate eq.([smear ] ) 60 times with @xmath114 in the case of the confining phase , 100 times with @xmath115 in the case of the coulomb phase . in fig .",
    "4 we show the result ( filled symbols ) for the lattice potential @xmath116 as a function of @xmath108 at @xmath117 and @xmath54 ( which is equivalent to @xmath118 .",
    "the condition @xmath103 to obtain a @xmath119 potential becomes @xmath120 in this case , and we assume that the lattice potential @xmath116 takes the form @xmath121\\right)~ , \\label{pot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where is @xmath58 $ ] ( the three - dimensional coulomb potential on a lattice is given in ( [ 3dcoulomb ] ) .",
    "the first term of ( [ pot ] ) is the unphysical self energy , the second term is a rotationally invariant part of the coulomb potential , and third term is the most dominant part of its breaking . from a @xmath122 fit we find that @xmath123 .",
    "the fitted lattice potential with the @xmath124 term in ( [ pot ] ) suppressed , i.e. @xmath125 is the dotted curve in fig .  4 , while the open symbols stand for the rotationally invariant data points .",
    "we see that the data justify the assumption that the deconfining phase is a coulomb phase .",
    "as the next task we consider the nature of the transition from the confining phase to the coulomb phase . in the confining phase our data indicate that the limit @xmath2 with @xmath3 kept fixed exists at finite @xmath8 . if we can show that @xmath4 also vanishes at the same value of @xmath8 in the coulomb phase , the transition from the confining phase to the coulomb phase is of second order .    to this end",
    ", we have to define the scale in the coulomb phase . in the naive continuum theory",
    "there are two dimensional quantities , the gauge coupling @xmath14 and the compactification radius @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we assume that @xmath1 and the low - energy value of @xmath14 are independent physical quantities at the quantum level , too .",
    "we then consider the limit @xmath2 with @xmath28 kept fixed , which is the same limiting process we have considered in the confining phase . in this limit , the quantity @xmath126 ( the coefficient @xmath127 of the tree - level coulomb potential ( [ pot ] ) ) has to diverge because @xmath128 while @xmath14 should remain finite by assumption .",
    "so naively one expects the scaling law @xmath129 , where @xmath75 is the critical value of @xmath8 at which @xmath130 vanishes . in fig .",
    "5 we plot @xmath131 versus @xmath8 for different values of @xmath60 ( or @xmath28 of ( [ rovera ] ) ) .",
    "we see that @xmath131 linearly decreases , and make therefore a theoretical ansatz for the scaling law : @xmath132 for @xmath133 , for instance , a @xmath122 fit yields that @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "if the tree - level equation ( [ pot0 ] ) would be correct at the quantum level , too , then it would mean that @xmath4 vanishes at @xmath136 in the deconfining phase .",
    "this would contradict the assumption that in the confining phase the lattice spacing @xmath4 approaches zero as @xmath8 approaches @xmath137 for @xmath138 ( see table i ) .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the transition from the deconfining phase to the confining one is a first order transition or a cross over transition .",
    "it may be well possible that the tree - level form ( [ pot0 ] ) receives quantum corrections in such a way that the transition is indeed of second order .",
    "therefore , we consider possible quantum corrections to @xmath131 which are consistent with the scaling law in fig .  5 and the value of @xmath75 in the confining phase ( given table i ) . since @xmath131 being dimensionless can depend only on the combination @xmath139 , the correction can only be a constant , i.e. , @xmath140 in table iii we give the results of the fits , from which we find that the ansatz for the nonperturbative quantum correction to the coefficient of the coulomb potential ( [ pot ] ) is consistent with our data , and we conclude that @xmath141 where we have not included the data for @xmath54 in ( [ alpha ] ) , because the error for this case is very large compared with others .",
    "this indicates that the assumption that the transition from the confining to the deconfining phase is a second order transition is consistent with the data .",
    "note that the transition for small values of @xmath60 , or large values of @xmath9 , is of first order @xcite .",
    "we expect that the first order transition for large values of @xmath9 changes to a cross over transition , and finally to the second order transition as we decrease the value of @xmath9 @xcite . ]",
    "the nonperturbative correction ( [ c1 ] ) means that the tree level relation @xmath142 should be modified to @xmath143 since @xmath144 is large , the correction is not small",
    ". the coulomb phase may be of phenomenological importance , because the color degrees of freedom do not need to be always confined .",
    "the @xmath0 part of the standard model , for instance , could result from a higher - dimensional yang - mills theory in the coulomb phase",
    ". then the equation like eq .",
    "( [ matching ] ) defines the matching condition .",
    "in this paper we have performed monte carlo simulations in a five - dimensional lattice @xmath0 yang - mills theory , where we have compactified one extra dimension .",
    "we have found that as the compactification radius @xmath1 decreases , the confining phase spreads more and more to the weak coupling regime , and the effective dimension of the theory gradually changes from five to four .",
    "our data indicate that for fixed @xmath3 the transition from the deconfining phase to the coulomb phase is of second order if @xmath3 is small enough .    assuming that the real four - dimensional qcd results from the five - dimensional qcd at low - energies , we have estimated the largest compactification radius @xmath145 so that the color degrees of freedom in four dimensions are confined . our estimate ( [ rmax ] ) should be understood as the first try , because our calculations are based on many theoretical assumptions , which can be justified if we perform simulations on five - dimensional , compactified @xmath100 lattice gauge theory .",
    "the striking fact is that there exists the maximal radius , and this may give an important phenomenological constraint for model building based on the kaluza - klein theories .",
    "the parameter regime we have considered in the present work corresponds to the regime in which the kaluza - klein idea is expected to be realized : at short distances we have the five - dimensional rotational invariance , and at long distances , the kaluza - klein excitations decouple so that the low - energy effective theory is a four - dimensional yang - mills theory .",
    "we found no indication that would contradict this picture .",
    "moreover , the compactified five - dimensional theory , which is perturbatively nonrenormalizable , has the predictive power ( unless examined at very short distances ) , which we conclude from the scaling laws we observe .",
    "( the readers are also invited to @xcite . )",
    "the parameter regime that corresponds to deconstructing extra dimensions @xcite is not the same as above @xcite ; two phases are nonperturbatively separated @xcite . in the phase for the conventional kaluza - klein theory , the vacuum expectation value of the ployakov loop ( that extends into the fifth dimension ) is nonzero @xcite , while it vanishes @xcite in the phase for deconstructing extra dimensions .",
    "( the phase for deconstructing extra dimensions is the one in which the layer structure in five - dimensional gauge theories can be realized @xcite ) . although it is not at al clear that the five - dimensional rotational invariance at short distances is recovered , it looks at the moment as if two different confining four - dimensional yang - mills theories could result from two different phases ( one from each ) of a five - dimensional theory .",
    "the difference is purely nonperturbative .",
    "it will be very exiting to investigate this difference more in detail , especially , in supersymmetric cases , where one has already analytic results , and it is shown that the five - dimensional lorentz invariance is recovered @xcite .    this work is supported by the grants - in - aid for scientific research from the japan society for the promotion of science ( jsps ) ( no .",
