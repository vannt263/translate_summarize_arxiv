    "monte carlo simulations of classical systems have generated very precise information about phases and phase transitions in statistical mechanics .",
    "one dramatic example of the power of the methodology is that of the ising model , where the transition temperature on a cubic lattice is now known to six decimal places  @xcite and critical exponents have been evaluated to four decimal places .",
    "@xcite a roughly similar situation holds for unfrustrated quantum spin and boson systems . for example , in the bose - hubbard hamiltonian ,  @xcite the critical interaction strengths at a density of one boson per site for the superfluid to mott insulator transition in the ground state , are available  @xcite to an accuracy of better than one part in @xmath0 .",
    "spatial lattice sizes are somewhat smaller than for classical problems since writing the partition function as a path integral introduces an additional ` imaginary time ' dimension , but are nevertheless quite large , e.g. ,  up to @xmath1 sites for the bose - hubbard example cited above .    fermions ( in more than one dimension ) are more challenging for two reasons .",
    "first , the fermionic action is non - local : the boltzmann weight typically takes the form of a determinant .",
    "thus , updating all the degrees of freedom has a computation time which scales as a nonlinear power of the system size @xmath2 .",
    "the cost of a method like determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc )  @xcite scales as @xmath3 , as opposed to the naive linear in @xmath2 scaling ( ignoring such complications as critical slowing down ) in many classical and quantum spin / boson applications .",
    "second , and far worse , there is no guarantee the sign of the determinant , which is used as the probability , is positive .",
    "although one can formally use the absolute value as a weight , and include the sign in the measurement , in practice one ends up evaluating the ratio of two numbers , which becomes dominated by statistical error at low temperatures as they both become very small .",
    "this situation is known as the  fermion sign problem \" ,  @xcite whose solution is conjectured to be np - hard .",
    "@xcite at present , therefore , there is no known method of accessing the low temperature properties of hamiltonians like the fermi - hubbard model with qmc .",
    "fortunately , there are some situations where the sign problem is not manifest . for example",
    ", the boltzmann weight often takes the form of the product of two determinants , one for each of the two electron spin species , and it can happen that the signs of the individual determinants perfectly match , so that the boltzmann weight remains positive .",
    "this occurs in the complete parameter range of the hubbard model with attractive interactions , enabling a study of superconductivity and charge density wave physics .",
    "it also occurs in the hubbard model with repulsive interactions on bipartite lattices in the limit of average one particle per lattice site ( half - filling ) , so that the mott transition and long - range antiferromagnetism can be explored .",
    "other instances of situations where the sign problem is absent are mentioned in sec .",
    "iic . however , many of the most interesting questions concerning strong correlation physics remain inaccessible , most notably the question of whether the two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice repulsive hubbard hamiltonian has a low temperature @xmath4-wave superconducting transition , so that it would provide a good description of cuprate superconductivity .",
    "@xcite    we have two main goals in this manuscript .",
    "the first is to present a set of data for the sign problem in dqmc for different geometries .",
    "these include bipartite [ one - dimensional chain , ladder , 2d square , and three - dimensional ( 3d ) cubic , lieb , honeycomb and the 1/5-depleted square ] lattices , and non - bipartite kagome and triangular lattices .",
    "we consider dqmc because it is a powerful and widely utilized approach to the correlated electron problem .",
    "our second goal is to discern trends in the dqmc sign problem .",
    "we will consider , for example , several new issues : how the sign depends on the spatial lattice size , the scaling of the sign in the vicinity of particle - hole symmetric ( phs ) points , and the ` entanglement ' of the sign as probed by the consideration of coupled cluster geometries .",
    "although statements concerning the first of these points , the spatial size dependence , have been made in the literature , numerical data are rather scanty , owing to the computational limitations existing in the initial investigations .",
    "specifically , the data in refs .   and were restricted to 4x4 , 6x6 , and 8x8 lattices .",
    "as a consequence , the scaling regime was not reached for many of the parameter sets .",
    "for example , the average sign sometimes _ increases _ as the system size grows , rather than decreasing .",
    "this situation is rectified here .",
    "the lattices we study also have various unique features , such as nesting of the fermi surface , van - hove singularities in the density of states @xmath5 , and flat bands , whose possible effects on the sign problem we will examine .",
    "it is worth noting what we will _ not _ cover : there are a number of methods which are closely related to dqmc in that they involve a hubbard - stratonovich decoupling of the interaction , and a boltzmann weight built from fermion determinants .",
    "these include impurity algorithms ,  @xcite as well as the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft )  @xcite and its cluster extensions , the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) ,  @xcite and the cellular dmft .",
    "@xcite a strength of some of these methods is that the sign problem is greatly mitigated relative to dqmc , at least if the cluster size is not too large .",
    "this is true even if the bath degrees of freedom are discretized .",
    "@xcite also closely related to dqmc are zero - temperature algorithms which use @xmath6 as a projection operator on a trial wave function .",
    "@xcite constraints can be introduced in these ground state methods to eliminate the sign problem , at the expense of systematic errors in the solution .",
    "@xcite despite their relations to dqmc , we will not discuss these approaches here .",
    "similarly , within dqmc itself there are different choices of the manner in which the hubbard - stratonovich field is decoupled .",
    "@xcite here , we base our calculations on only the  density decoupling \" , described in sec .",
    "though we do not explicitly consider the above related approaches , we expect that some of our results and general analysis may have applications to them as well .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we review the hubbard hamiltonian and the basic formulation of dqmc , followed by some general , well - known properties of the resulting sign problem . in sec .",
    "iii we record values for the average sign for different lattice geometries .",
    "section iv examines general patterns in this data .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v contains concluding remarks .",
    "our focus is on the single - band hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the creation ( destruction ) operator for a fermion with spin @xmath9 on site @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the number operator .",
    "@xmath12 is the hopping amplitude between nearest - neighbor sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the interaction strength , and @xmath16 is the chemical potential . for geometries where there is only one type of hopping , we set @xmath17 as the unit of energy .",
    "we will denote the first line of the hamiltonian @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) by @xmath19 , and the second line by @xmath20 .",
    "this latter term is written in phs form .",
    "( see sec .",
    "the different models considered in this paper are distinguished solely by the geometry encoded in the near - neighbor designation @xmath21 in the kinetic energy term .",
    "even with a common choice @xmath22 , different geometries have distinct bandwidths @xmath23 , the spread of eigenvalues of the @xmath24 ( single particle ) hamiltonian .",
    "although it is sometimes the case  @xcite that using @xmath23 as the scale of kinetic energy , rather than @xmath25 , produces better comparisons across different models , we did not find that to be useful here .",
    "we retain the standard convention of normalizing to @xmath25 .",
    "there is , of course , much interest in generalizations of the hubbard hamiltonian , e.g. ,  to multiple bands , longer - range density - density interactions , and hund s rule type interactions .",
    "multiple bands , can in fact be written in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) , with the understanding that the label @xmath13 incorporates both spatial and band indices .",
    "thus , from the viewpoint of a dqmc simulation , setting up the 2d ` periodic anderson model ' ( pam ) which has a square lattice of spatial sites and two orbitals per site , is formally identical to a two layer geometry , in which there is a single orbital on each site .",
    "thus , with the freedom to choose @xmath26 to be site / orbital ( bond ) dependent , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) incorporates hamiltonians like the pam .",
    "concerning intersite ( interorbital ) and hund s rule interactions , the sign problem is typically much worse than for an on - site @xmath15 between fermions of different spin species only .",
    "for example , for a model of the cuo@xmath27 planes of cuprate superconductors ,  @xcite it was found that the sign problem restricted simulations to interactions @xmath28 at temperatures where local spin correlations were seen to begin to develop . like dqmc , hund s rule interactions also present grave sign problem difficulties in dmft .",
    "@xcite we do not explicitly consider them here .",
    "the fundamental idea of dqmc  @xcite is to take advantage of the fact that it is possible to compute analytically the trace of a product of the exponentials of quadratic forms of fermion creation and destruction operators .",
    "if we denote the vector of creation operators @xmath29 by @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are ( symmetric ) @xmath32 matrices of real numbers , then @xmath33 here @xmath34 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the trace in the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : quadformidentity ] ) is over a @xmath35 dimensional hilbert space of the fermionic operators while the determinant on the right hand side is taken over a real matrix of dimension @xmath2 .    the interaction term in the hubbard hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) is not quadratic in the fermionic operators , but can be made so by first discretizing the inverse temperature @xmath36 and then employing the trotter approximation  @xcite @xmath37 here the exponential of the full hamiltonian @xmath38 is approximated by the product of the exponentials of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , a well - controlled procedure which can be made arbitrarily accurate by taking @xmath39 .",
    "the purpose of this procedure is the isolation of the exponential of the interaction term @xmath20 , which can then be rewritten using a hubbard - stratonovich(hs ) transformation : @xmath40 where @xmath41 . because one needs to transform the interaction term on every spatial site @xmath10 and also for each of the @xmath42 exponentials of @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pathintegral ] ) , there are a total of @xmath44 hs variables @xmath45 .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dhs ] ) , we have employed the discrete hs transformation introduced by hirsch ,  @xcite but one could also use a continuous variable @xmath46 and a gaussian integral , @xmath47 with @xmath48",
    ". there are some differences in the efficiency of the exploration of phase space between the discrete and continuous cases .",
    "@xcite    once the hs transformation is introduced , all the exponentials in the trace of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pathintegral ] ) are quadratic in the fermion operators , so , the identity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : quadformidentity ] ) can be used to perform the trace over the hilbert space analytically .",
    "the sum over the hs configurations @xmath45 is performed stochastically using monte carlo techniques .",
    "the corresponding boltzmann weight takes the form of the product of two determinants ( one for each spin specie ) of matrices @xmath49 of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "as this determinant product may be negative for some hs configurations , the sampling is done using the absolute values of the determinant product , and measured expectation values are adjusted accordingly .",
    "the average sign @xmath50 is then defined to be the ratio of the integral of the product of up and down spin determinants , to the integral of the absolute value of the product .",
    "an analogous definition holds for the average sign @xmath51 of the individual determinants : @xmath52 in the case we consider here , with no external magnetic field , by symmetry @xmath53 .    as a practical matter , these quantities are obtained by generating configurations with the ( non - negative ) weight @xmath54 and measuring the ratios @xmath55 and @xmath56 for each configuration @xmath46 . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dhs ] ) and ( [ eq : chs ] ) , we have coupled the hs variable to the @xmath57 component of fermionic spin , @xmath58 .",
    "it is also possible to write transformations which involve the @xmath59 components of a spin , @xmath60 , or even local pairing operators , @xmath61 .",
    "these in general worsen the sign problem .",
    "@xcite in the attractive hubbard hamiltonian , the hs variable couples to the charge @xmath62 on site @xmath13 .",
    "this makes the matrices @xmath63 identical for up and down fermions , so that their determinants are also identical , and thus , there is no sign problem .",
    "if a charge decoupling is used for the repulsive model , the hs transformation would involve complex numbers , and the determinants would be complex as well , leading to an even more challenging ` phase problem ' .",
    "we note that there are many details omitted in this brief description , including methods to stabilize the product of the @xmath64 matrices so that round - off errors do not accumulate , the precise monte carlo update procedure ( how many variables are altered in each step ) , more rapid procedures for obtaining the ratio of new to old determinants after a hs variable is updated , how to evaluate non - equal time observables , analytic continuation to obtain dynamic behavior , and so forth .",

    "[ ] for more complete discussions .      on a bipartite lattice , and at @xmath65 , the hamiltonian eq .",

    "@xmath67 on the a(b ) sublattice .",

    "correlation functions at density @xmath71 and @xmath72 have the same values , or are trivially related .",
    "particle - hole transformations involving only one spin specie can also be used to relate the attractive and repulsive hubbard hamiltonians in this limit .",
    "phs has profound implications for dqmc .",
    "when it is present , the determinants of the up and down matrices @xmath73 have the same sign .",
    "thus , although they individually can go negative , their product is always positive . as a consequence",
    ", low temperature physics can be accessed at half - filling .",
    "this fact enabled dqmc to establish rigorously  @xcite that the single band , square lattice hubbard model has long - range nel order at @xmath74 , as opposed to a disordered ( resonating valence bond ) ground state .    the sign problem can be absent in some other types of hamiltonians with a similar symmetry requirement , for example in a model with an interaction which takes the form of the square of near - neighbor hopping , @xcite for a low energy theory of the onset of antiferromagnetism ,  @xcite and in spin polarized fermi systems .",
    "@xcite indeed , the number of special situations where the sign problem is absent is rapidly growing , including , for example , in quasi-1d condensed matter models of ferromagnetism ,  @xcite and via the ` fermion bag ' approach , in lattice gauge theory .",
    "@xcite the sign problem is also absent in hubbard models with a larger number of spin components ,  @xcite and , very interestingly , in a class of spinless fermion models@xcite , a unique situation where positivity is not dependent on having an even number of fermionic species .",
    "our goal in this section is to present a unified and easily comparable collection of data for the sign problem for different lattice geometries , including hypercubic lattices in dimensions @xmath75 ; other bipartite structures like the honeycomb , lieb and 1/5-depleted square lattices ; and finally two non - bipartite lattices : triangular and kagome . for each case we will exhibit the average sign for a range of temperatures @xmath70 , interaction strengths @xmath15 , lattice sizes , and densities .",
    "we focus on the product of the signs of the up and down determinants , since that is what is relevant for extracting physics from the dqmc simulation . however , in sec .",
    "ivb we will present a brief analysis of the individual spin components . among other things ,",
    "we observe that , except at phs points , the signs of the up and down determinants tend to be rather uncorrelated , so that the signs of the individual components lend no further information , and can be qualitatively inferred from the square root of the total sign .",
    "some of these geometries have unique features in their non - interacting densities of states ( dos ) . the square lattice possesses a van - hove dos singularity at @xmath76 .",
    "in contrast , the honeycomb lattice has a dos which vanishes linearly there .",
    "the lieb lattice has a flat energy band between two dispersing ones , while the flat band in the kagome lattice can be chosen to be either the lowest or highest set of energy levels , depending on the sign of @xmath25 .",
    "one of our goals is to examine how such features might affect the fermion sign , an issue to which we will return in the conclusion .      in this subsection",
    "we present data for hypercubic lattices ; linear chains , ladders , the square lattice , and the cubic lattice . in all cases ,",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions except for the rungs of the ladder geometry .",
    "although the sign does not cause a problem for hubbard world line methods@xcite in one dimension , dqmc does have a sign problem in this case@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chainu4beta8 ] , the average fermion sign , @xmath50 ( also denoted @xmath77 ) , for the chain geometry is shown for fixed @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "figure  [ fig : chainu4beta8](a ) shows the doping dependence of the sign , which has a non - trivial structure .",
    "most notably , it shows a peak around @xmath80 .",
    "one may wonder if such a local maximum arises due to remnants of the ` shell ' effect .",
    "that is , at @xmath24 the @xmath81 space grid is sufficiently coarse such that @xmath82 ) shows distinct plateaus where @xmath50 tends to be closer to one .",
    "this phenomenon is well known , for example , on square lattices that are not too large ( e.g. ,  @xmath83 ) .",
    "however , as will be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : squareu6beta4 ] , this occurs only on small lattices , and is unlikely the origin of the maximum at quarter filling here where the @xmath81 space grid is much more refined .",
    "another interesting feature is that @xmath50 remains small at low density .",
    "this is , again , rather different from what happens on a square lattice where @xmath84 as @xmath85 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : squareu6beta4 ] ) or even ladders ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ladderu6beta4 ] ) .",
    "the low value of @xmath50 as @xmath86 does not appear to be connected to the divergence of the density of states at the bottom of the band since the same divergence occurs in the ladder geometry where @xmath50 recovers to one as @xmath85 .",
    "figures  [ fig : chainu4beta8](b ) and [ fig : chainu4beta8](c ) show the scaling of the average sign with spatial lattice size @xmath2 and inverse temperature @xmath87 respectively .",
    "after plateaux at small @xmath2 and @xmath87 , where @xmath88 , the average sign decreases in a manner which is largely consistent with exponential .",
    "@xmath89 is not perfectly linear in @xmath87 or @xmath2 , but exhibits some downward curvature , which we believe indicates the scaling regime has not yet been fully attained .",
    "we will remark on this more fully later in this section .",
    "as we shall see , this exponential decrease is also the case in other geometries , although the decrease with @xmath2 once one exits the plateau is in general less abrupt than with @xmath87 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chainu4beta8](b ) at @xmath90 , the average sign , despite its exponential decay , remains quite manageable out to @xmath91 .",
    "even at @xmath92 the spatial size must be tripled from @xmath93 before ln@xmath94 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chainu4beta8](c ) , on the other hand , the decay to ln@xmath94 takes place after only a 50% increase in @xmath87 ( from @xmath79 to @xmath95 ) .",
    "next , we turn to ladder geometries , which are natural extensions of chains , before studying the square lattice .",
    "ladders are of interest for several reasons .",
    "first , they have been extensively studied by dmrg  @xcite as a stepping stone to 2d .",
    "second , by changing the ratio @xmath96 of the rung hopping to the hopping along the chains , one can access @xmath24 states that are metallic or band - insulating at half - filling .",

    "shell structure is evident for the smallest cluster ( @xmath159 ) , however , as with the square lattice , is absent for larger lattices ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "the most marked difference from the bipartite cases is that @xmath50 is not pinned at one for @xmath76 , but otherwise the behavior of @xmath50 is quite similar to the previous cases . the same is true of the kagome lattice in fig .",

    "we now discuss possible patterns which emerge from these datasets .",
    "we focus on three areas : the role of the density of states , the contribution of individual spin components to the sign problem , and spatial entanglement .",
    "a fourth feature of @xmath50 , scaling in the vicinity of the phs point , was discussed previously .",
    "it seems plausible that the noninteracting density of states could play an important role in the sign problem . in this subsection",
    "we make a few observations on that possibility .",
    "the square and honeycomb lattices have quite dramatically different @xmath24 densities of states , especially near @xmath164 where the dos diverges logarithmically for the square lattices , and vanishes linearly for the honeycomb lattice . yet , if we compare the behaviors of @xmath50 as a function of filling in figs .",
    "[ fig : squareu6beta4 ] and [ fig : honeycombu8beta4 ] , we see little qualitative difference . both evolutions exhibit a rapid fall - off from @xmath88 at the phs point @xmath76 , a broad minimum centered at @xmath165 , followed by a recovery to @xmath88 in the dilute limit .",
    "the differences in dos are even more diverse among the other geometries studied here . however , the special features of the dos , which could trend in completely opposite directions , appear to have little to no effect on the behavior of @xmath50 here .",
    "indeed , we have noted already that , more generally , the different geometries and their associated distinct densities of states all share a qualitatively similar behavior of @xmath50 with doping .",
    "the only ` unique ' geometry was the one - dimensional case where , for example @xmath50 did not recover to one at low densities .",
    "most of the data we present are for interaction strengths @xmath15 at least four times the fermion hopping @xmath25 , and hence , roughly speaking , at least half the bandwidth @xmath23 .",
    "these sorts of interaction strengths are the ones typically studied in examining magnetic , pair , and charge correlations in hubbard models .",
    "the conclusion of the observations above seems to be that @xmath166 brings the system far enough from the @xmath24 limit that most features of the noninteracting dos are no longer a controlling factors in the sign problem .",
    "apparently , the space and imaginary time fluctuations of the hubbard - stratonovich field @xmath167 , whose effect on the fermions increases with @xmath15 through the parameter @xmath168 of eq .",

    "is significantly reduced when @xmath15 is increased from 4 to 6 .",
    "this lack of dependence on the dos is the case even for a flat band , where the very large delta function in the dos might have been expected to have an especially discernible impact on @xmath50 .",
    "however , in the case of the lieb lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig : liebu5.6beta6 ] ) , @xmath50 behaves completely smoothly through the edge of the flat band at @xmath145 .",
    "we do note that broad features in the @xmath24 dos do appear to have some correlation with the behavior of @xmath171 .",
    "for example , for the chain , square , and cubic lattices , we observe that @xmath172 tends to be smaller when a  smoothed \" dos is larger ( not shown ) .",
    "behavior near half - filling for bipartite lattices is additionally mediated , as discussed previously , by the fact that at half - filling @xmath173 by symmetry .",
    "thus far , we have focused almost exclusively on the total sign @xmath50 . as commented in sec .",
    "iib , assuming there is no ` off - diagonal ' term in the hamiltonian , allowing the mixing of different spin species , the fermionic trace results in separate determinants for each @xmath9 .",
    "here , we do a further analysis of the signs of the individual spin components .",
    "we have two goals : first , we would like to examine the correlations between the up and down determinants for the same hs configurations .",
    "second , as in the case of the ladder or the 1/5-depleted square geometry , the spin - resolved sign may offer some insight into the potential connection of the average sign to other observables and phase transitions that occur in the phs regimes ( half filling ) .",
    "we start with the second objective .",
    "we consider a ladder geometry with intra - chain hopping @xmath25 and inter - chain ( rung ) hopping @xmath174 .",
    "the @xmath24 band structure is @xmath175 , so that the ladder is a bi for @xmath176 at half - filling , and a metal for @xmath177 .",
    "figure [ fig : spin_components_ladder ] shows the product @xmath178 as a function of @xmath96 for @xmath179 ( where @xmath180 ) and @xmath78 for @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "there seems to be some evidence that entering into the metallic phase at @xmath183 coincides with an increase in the number of negative determinants .",
    "the @xmath184 limit is also interesting .",
    "it corresponds to two decoupled 1d chains .",
    "evidently , even the individual determinants are free of negative signs at half - filling .    unlike for the ladder geometry , the product of the average signs for the two spin species does not display any signature at the ( magentic ) phase transitions for the 1/5-depleted square lattice .",
    "this can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : onefifthhalffilling ] where @xmath178 at half filling is plotted vs @xmath150 for @xmath124 and @xmath119 .",
    "similar to the total sign away from half filling ( fig .  [ fig : onefifth_2 ] ) , this quantity also decreases from one in the large @xmath150 decoupled dimers region to near zero in the small @xmath150 plaquette region .",
    "there are two quantum phase transitions@xcite for this value of the interaction at @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "however , the average signs vary smoothly around these values with no special feature ( at this temperature ) that can be attributed to the phase transitions in the ground state .    with this in mind , we analyze the correlations between the up and down average signs for the square and triangular lattices in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_components_sq_and_triangle ] . in the former geometry , at half - filling ,",
    "because of phs there is a perfect correlation of the up and down signs , i.e. , @xmath88 , which differs substantially from @xmath178 .",
    "correlations remain in the neighborhood of the phs point . however , for densities @xmath187 ( and , by symmetry , @xmath188 ) , @xmath189 to a high degree of accuracy , indicating that the signs of the spin up and spin down matrices for given hs configurations are essentially independent .",
    "it is interesting that the density at which correlations disappear roughly coincides to where the sign problem is the worst .",
    "we expect the absence of the phs to alter the relationship between the total sign and its individual components at half filling .",
    "this issue is examined in the triangular lattice results in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_components_sq_and_triangle ] .",
    "the determinant signs are generally independent over the entire density range , with @xmath189 , except for a small region around three quarter filling , @xmath190 .",
    "this is evidently related to the bumps in @xmath50 already noted in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangleu6beta4 ] , and provides additional insight into that phenomenon : the increase in @xmath101 is associated , at least in part , with a larger correlation of the two determinant signs .",
    "interestingly , the latter seems to be taking place close to where the peak in the dos is , suggesting a possible connection , however , a similar but less prominent bump also appears around @xmath191 , where there is no feature in the dos .",
    "our data have supported the exponential decay of the sign with @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cubicu5beta4.5 ] for the cubic lattice is inconclusive , perhaps due to the shorter lengths of the sides ) . here , we point out that there is a limit in which this phenomena can be rigorously established . specifically , we observe that the sign must decay exponentially with @xmath2 for lattices consisting of decoupled clusters ( by , for example , setting the inter - cluster hopping @xmath12 to zero )",
    ". clearly the average sign of the entire system will be the product of the signs of the subclusters . if the subclusters are identical , an exponential decrease of the average sign with system size ( number of subclusters ) trivially follows .",
    "one can then ask what is the effect of linking the clusters .",
    "if the connection is through non - zero inter - cluster hopping , a ` world - line ' picture would generally suggest the sign should get even smaller , as the fermion paths are allowed additional opportunity to exchange . in fact , precisely this would happen as a lattice of decoupled chains in the @xmath192 direction with zero hopping in the @xmath193 direction , @xmath194 , is converted into a 2d lattice by turning on @xmath195 .",
    "the @xmath194 limit has no significant sign problem in world - line approaches , whereas large @xmath195 does .    in dqmc",
    ", the opposite can occur : the linking ( ` entanglement ' ) of spatial clusters mitigates the sign problem .",
    "this can be seen in several hubbard hamiltonian geometries which contain decoupled clusters as a limiting case .",
    "the simplest is the ladder geometry where @xmath196 corresponds to two independent chains .",
    "other examples are the ` plaquette ' model studied by scalapino@xcite , kivelson ,  @xcite and others ,  @xcite as a description of superconductivity arising from pair binding on @xmath197 plaquettes , and the 1/5-depleted square lattice  @xcite for which the results in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : onefifth_2 ] show the improvement of the sign by increasing the inter - plaquette hopping @xmath198 from zero .",
    "the sign problem remains one of the fundamental challenges in computational physics .",
    "this paper has focused on the sign problem in determinant quantum monte carlo .",
    "our goal has been to bring together data for a collection of geometries ( hypercubic , ladder , depleted square , lieb , honeycomb , kagome , and triangular lattices ) and parameter ( temperature , interaction strength , and density ) ranges that are , at present either not available or , at best , scattered through the literature .",
    "there are other cases one could study",
    ". however , this extensive set already enables us to make some general inferences about the sign problem , at least in the specific case of the dqmc , which may have other applications as well .",
    "we first considered the general behavior of the sign @xmath199 as a function of inverse temperature @xmath200 and of lattice size @xmath2 .",
    "arguments for exponential behavior have been made in this regard involving the winding of world lines , in approaches where such paths are sampled in the simulation .",
    "however , it has been noted that this reasoning does not necessarily transfer to the auxiliary field approach of dqmc , where it is difficult to see how to map the problem onto a sum over world line paths of an effective hamiltonian with local interactions .",
    "without such a theoretical basis , it is of interest to explore numerically the scaling of @xmath199 with @xmath87 and @xmath2 for a variety of cases , to determine the general behavior .",
    "previous work regarding @xmath87 used the hubbard model on @xmath201 lattices@xcite and @xmath83 lattices@xcite finding an exponential decay of @xmath199 with @xmath87 for large @xmath87 .",
    "our data , on considerably larger spatial lattices and for a variety of different geometries , is also consistent with a large @xmath87 exponential decay , with a small @xmath87 regime throughout which @xmath202 , and eliminates ` shell effects ' seen in smaller lattices .",
    "we next explored the scaling of @xmath199 with lattice size @xmath2 .",
    "previous work , comparing 2d @xmath83 , @xmath203 , and @xmath204 hubbard lattices@xcite and 3d @xmath205 and @xmath206 lattices@xcite was inconclusive . in both the 2d and 3d cases ,",
    "for example , for some parameter ranges @xmath199 was actually worst for the smallest systems studied .",
    "using larger lattice sizes and differing geometries , our results are clearly consistent with an exponential decay of @xmath199 with @xmath2 for large @xmath2 . in a few but not all cases",
    ", we also found a small @xmath2 regime in which @xmath202 , similar to what was seen for @xmath87 .",
    "data based on an examination of @xmath199 as a function of @xmath15 were consistent with a similar exponential decay of @xmath199 with @xmath15 , for @xmath15 sufficiently large .",
    "as is well known , the sign problem is ` cured ' in special particle - hole symmetric cases like the half - filled hubbard model on a bipartite lattice , where the determinants always come in pairs which share the same sign .",
    "this paper presented a more general study of correlations between the signs .",
    "near half - filling , for the square lattice , we found @xmath207 , where @xmath172 is the average sign of a single spin determinant , see eq .  6 .",
    "this indicates the development of strong correlations between the signs of the up and down determinants , a closely related issue is the precise form of the decay of @xmath199 close to the half - filled @xmath76 phs point where @xmath208 .",
    "we found a rapid decay , consistent with the form @xmath209 and that ",
    "@xmath129\"becomes increasingly large and negative with @xmath15 and with @xmath87 .",
    "this indicates a rapid loss of the positive correlations between up and down determinants as one moves away from half filling .",
    "lastly , we considered the effect of  entanglement \" , where initially decoupled clusters were linked together with fermion hopping terms .",
    "this linking increased @xmath199 improving the sign problem , in complete contrast to what one would expect in a  world line \" picture , where the additional windings available due to the extra hopping terms would typically be expected to worsen the sign problem .",
    "another significant feature of this work is that the geometries being studied have a wide range of noninteracting densities of states . a crucial conclusion of our work , evident in comparing the top panels of figs .",
    "2 - 7 is that , despite the wide variation in the dos , on bipartite lattices , the behavior of the sign with density is almost  universal \" in the sense that it always falls rapidly away as the lattice is doped , attains a minimum in the vicinity of @xmath102 and then recovers .",
    "this observation is of interest because of the rather different physics expected of strongly correlated electrons on these geometries .",
    "the only exception to this universality is seen in fig .  [ fig : chainu4beta8 ] , for the one dimensional chain .",
    "overall , features in the @xmath163 dos associated with special behavior at an isolated energy seem to have little effect on @xmath199",
    ". this may be due to the  smoothing out \" of these features by the hs field fluctuations which increase with increasing @xmath15",
    ". there does , however , seem to be some indication that a larger value of a  smoothed \" dos is associated with smaller average signs @xmath53 of the determinants of the matrices of individual spins .    another interesting possibility for further exploration is that of a linkage between @xmath50 and the spectral function at the fermi level , @xmath210 . here",
    "@xmath211 is related to the time dependent green s function via @xmath212 and equals the density of states @xmath213 in the non - interacting limit .",
    "the spectral function incorporates the effects of @xmath15 and hence , potentially , might correlate better with the sign .",
    "there are some hints that this is the case , for example , on a square lattice the @xmath24 density of states diverges at half - filling yet the low - temperature @xmath211 vanishes for all @xmath15 and the sign behaves perfectly .",
    "indeed , the sign behaves well in a range of chemical potentials @xmath16 within the mott - slater gap .",
    "one could imagine pursuing this possible connection more closely through computing the spectral functions for the various geometries and parameter values considered here .",
    "however , this would be a major task beyond the scope of this paper , involving the measurement of the imaginary - time dependent green s function and its analytic continuation to real space .",
    "in addition , because it is more difficult to obtain @xmath211 , as compared to the noninteracting density of states , it is unclear what the utility of the discovery of a connection between @xmath211 and the sign would be .    despite the data and interpretation presented here , the sign problem remains a big mystery .",
    "of particular interest is the possible relation between @xmath50 and the underlying physics of correlated electrons .",
    "for example , early in the development of dqmc , hirsch pointed out@xcite a mapping between the spin - spin correlation function , a property solely of the hubbard hamiltonian itself , and a correlation function of the hubbard - stratonovich field @xmath46 .",
    "since the fluctuations in @xmath46 ultimately determine the sign problem , this suggests the possibility that the behavior of @xmath50 might be related to some appropriate observable .",
    "we end on a speculative note in this regard .",
    "the unfortunate coincidence ( if it is a coincidence ) that for the square lattice @xmath50 is worst behaved very close to the most interesting ` optimal ' doping , where @xmath214 is largest in the cuprate superconductors , has often been opined .",
    "one thing we observe here is that this dip in @xmath50 at @xmath102 is absent in @xmath215 but appears already in the ladder geometry .",
    "since hubbard ladders appear to show signatures of @xmath4-wave pairing@xcite the possibility of a deep connection between the fermion sign and superconductivity in the hubbard hamiltonian remains a possibility .",
