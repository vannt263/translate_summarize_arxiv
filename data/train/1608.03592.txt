    "are then subject to radial drift @xcite and turbulent diffusion @xcite , which are sufficiently rapid as to lead to an approximate steady - state on small scales .",

    "slower planetesimal formation time scales lead to clearly defined regions where first radial drift and then planetesimal formation dominate .",

    "the mass accretion rate of solids reaching the snow line is substantially reduced , by a factor that ranges from several to more than an order of magnitude . as a result ,",
    "the rate of planetesimal formation at any given radius depends on whether planetesimals have formed further out in the disk . for most of the models",
    "considered the sweet spot for planetesimal formation is well outside the snow line , in some cases as far out as 30 - 40  au .",
    "planetesimals are predicted to be laid down across a broad range of radii for high particle fluxes , whereas lower fluxes yield a narrower distribution .",
    "the outer cut - off will be sharp if , as simulations suggest @xcite , planetesimal formation becomes rapidly inefficient below a threshold metallicity .",
    "we now explore how robust these conclusions are to neglected physical effects .",
    "turbulent particle diffusion works against particle pile - up @xcite , further favoring large radii as sites for planetesimal formation , but the condensation of vapor diffusing across the snow line has the opposite effect @xcite .",

    "we supplement these equations with source / sink terms appropriate for instantaneous sublimation and condensation of water vapor , following the method and chemical constants given in @xcite . in brief , at radii where ice is not fully sublimated , we sublimate or condense the appropriate amount of ice or vapor at each time step to maintain the actual vapor pressure of water at the equilibrium value given by the clausius - clapeyron equation .",
    "we assume that there is no significant change to the size distribution of particles in the vicinity of the snow line , an assumption which minimizes its importance . in more complete models ,",
    "at least some vapor condenses on to pre - existing particles , growing them to larger sizes @xcite .    .",
    "outward diffusion and condensation of vapor leads to a modest enhancement of the solid surface density outside the snow line for cm - sized ( and larger ) particles.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure  [ fig3 ] shows the resulting steady - state profiles of vapor and solids , computed in the fiducial disk model .",
    "the solid metallicity ( which is freely scalable in models that ignore planetesimal formation ) is set to match the analytic results for @xmath67 at 50  au . for @xmath76",
    "the surface density of solids is close to a power - law , consistent with turbulent diffusion being a minor effect on these scales . for mm - sized particles",
    "the condensation of diffusing vapor also makes a negligible change to the equilibrium distribution of solids , but for cm - sized ( and larger ) solids a modest enhancement of solids upstream of the snow line occurs .",
    "slightly stronger effects are possible if @xmath77 . because the radial drift velocity exceeds the gas velocity , the abundance of water vapor interior to the snow line is enhanced as long as large masses of small solids remain present in the disk .",
    "-@xmath23 space , including the effects of turbulent particle diffusion and vapor diffusion / condensation .",

    "[ sec_analytic ] , we show in figure  [ fig4 ] an illustrative example of how the results shown in figure  [ fig1 ] are modified by turbulent diffusion and vapor condensation . as before , the gas disk has @xmath78 and @xmath63 , which places the snow line at radii similar to those inferred for the solar system @xcite .",
    "as was already obvious from figure  [ fig3 ] , for mm - sized particles the extra physics in the numerical model makes very little difference to the predicted radii where planetesimals could form . for cm - sized particles",
    "there is a more significant deviation from the analytic model results .",
    "the higher surface density caused by the condensation of diffusing water vapor results in a secondary peak of planetesimal formation just outside the snow line , but does not alter the conclusion that the most - favored location lies further out .",
    "this result would be reinforced at higher _ gas _ accretion rates , arguably more appropriate to an early phase of disk evolution , which would boost the threshold size for vapor condensation effects to matter .",
    "at radii beyond the water snow line there is a limited window to prompt planetesimal formation that invokes only known physical processes : coagulation to a fixed size that is of the order of mm , radial drift , and gravitational collapse of streaming - initiated over - densities .",
    "planetesimal formation via this route is possible early on  while radial drift is rapidly reducing the global dust - to - gas ratio  and would typically lead to the deposition of a broad and massive belt of planetesimals well outside the snow line .",
    "we have not attempted fine tuning of the model , but figure  [ fig2 ] makes it clear that features such as the outer edge to the kuiper belt @xcite and the large masses of primordial debris required in the nice model @xcite , are qualitatively consistent with planetesimal formation expectations , as noted by @xcite .",
    "efficient early planetesimal formation is a prerequisite for early planet formation , which has been proposed as an explanation for the ring - like structures seen in alma observations of hl  tau @xcite .",
    "there is tension , however , between other observations and _ any _ model that invokes radial drift and pile - up as key ingredients of planetesimal formation .",
    "such models predict a rapid loss of small solids via radial drift and planetesimal formation , whereas observations of co line emission toward mostly older sources favor dust - to - gas ratios in _ excess _ of @xmath44 @xcite",
    ". a better understanding of gas disk mass estimates , which for now differ substantially depending on the technique used ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is the single most important advance that would constrain theoretical models of radial drift .",
    "our model is deliberately simple , and is intended to provide insight into the physical origin and robustness of more complex approaches .",
    "it could be improved by better delineating the conditions needed for planetesimal formation ( e.g. by including the dependence on the radial pressure gradient , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and by modeling the coupled growth and drift of particles .",
    "several authors have already developed such coupled models .",
    "@xcite , using a monte carlo dust coagulation code , argued for preferential triggering of the streaming instability beyond the ice line .",
    "similarly , @xcite , using a detailed model for particle growth coupled to estimates of planetesimal formation thresholds similar to ours , found that dust - rich disks with weak turbulence promote prompt outer disk planetesimal formation . in the inner disk",
    ", there is general agreement that planetesimal formation is harder , and a prompt route is only possible if particles grow to substantially larger sizes ( limited only by fragmentation and radial drift , rather than bouncing , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , planetesimal formation in the terrestrial planet region may occur via a less - efficient stochastic channel ( driven by local turbulent enhancements in @xmath41 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and at still smaller radii at persistent traps associated with the inner edge of the dead zone @xcite . despite their differences all models agree that attaining the conditions needed for planetesimal formation is relatively hard , and that as a result the initial distribution of planetesimals is unlikely to be a simple power - law but rather a complex function of radius .    building the cores of the giant planets",
    "requires , first , the deposition of a large mass of solids into planetesimals @xcite .",
    "the preference of the streaming instability for relatively large stopping times challenges the common view that the favored location for this deposition is adjacent to the snow line .",
    "even when the effects of vapor diffusion and condensation are considered , we find that the best time and place to lay down a large mass of planetesimals is early and at large radii .",
    "this suggests a model for core formation in which planetesimal formation and initial growth occurs well beyond the snow line .",
