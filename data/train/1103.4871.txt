    "the two nearby middle - aged pulsars , vela ( psr b0833@xmath545 ) and geminga ( psr j0633 + 1746 ) , belong to a small group of rotation powered neutron stars ( nss ) , which are identified in various spectral domains outside the radio range .",

    "emission mechanisms of pulsars are still poorly understood , and the presence of such multiwavelength objects is very useful for the progress in this field .    in soft x - rays and extremal ultraviolet ( euv ) the emission from the vela and geminga pulsars is dominated by the thermal blackbody ( bb ) like radiation believed to be originated from cooling surfaces of the nss , and , possible , from their hot polar caps . in",
    "the rest ranges the spectra are described by a power - law ( pl ) with different spectral indices in different spectral domains .",
    "this emission is nonthermal and generated by relativistic particles accelerated in magnetospheres of the rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized nss .    in the optical the nonthermal spectra of both pulsars",

    "prior photometric measurements , we converted each image from mjy steradian@xmath11 to dn units using the conversion factors from image fits headers . in this case",
    "the _ daophot _ magnitude error output can be directly used for the flux uncertainty estimates . to find an optimal aperture radius based on the maximal signal to noise ratio ,",
    "photometric growth curves were obtained and used . for the pulsar candidates at 3.6 and 5.8",
    "@xmath1 m the optimal circular aperture radius was 4 pixels ( at 06 pixel scale ) with the background annulus and dannulus in the ranges of 56 and 46 pixels , respectively .",
    "the measured fluxes were multiplied by aperture correction factors taken from the irac data handbook . we have performed the psf photometry as well and got the results consistent with the aperture photometry at 1@xmath3 level .",
    "conservative 3@xmath3 point source magnitude upper limits can be placed for the counterpart candidates in the mid - ir bands where the pulsar fields have been observed but no candidates were found .",
    "to do that , the circular aperture radii were selected encapsulating @xmath12 80 % of a potential point source flux , the apertures were centred at the pulsar positions , and standard deviations and inherent flux variations within these apertures were used .",
    "the magnitudes were converted into fluxes in physical units and the results are summarized in table [ t : phot ] . for geminga at 3.6 @xmath1 m , where the counterpart candidate is visible only at 2@xmath3 level , the data from the aors 19037952 and 19037696 ( table [ t : obs ] ) provide consistent results .",
    "however , the flux uncertainty is smaller for the former aor , where the zodiacal background is lower , and we use this result for our further analysis .",
    "let us assume that our mid - ir identifications are real , and consider , how this can affect the spectra of the pulsars . using the measured mid - ir fluxes , available optical and uv data , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mw ] we compile dereddened multiwavelength spectra of the vela and geminga pulsars in the mid - ir - uv range , and compare them with the respective spectrum of the crab pulsar taken from @xcite . the interstellar extinctions _",
    "e(b - v ) _ are 0.055 and 0.023 mag towards vela and geminga , respectively @xcite .",
    "these are small enough , and dereddening corrections in the mid - ir bands are negligible as compared to the measured flux uncertainties .",
    "for instance , the magnitude correction a@xmath13 at @xmath14 = 3.6 @xmath1 m is @xmath4 0.01 mag for both objects .",
    "for clearness , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mw ] we notify the broad bands , where pulsar fluxes were measured , and indicate which ones were obtained with the _ spitzer_/irac or with the mips .",
    "in contrast to the crab , that shows almost a flat spectrum in the considered range , the compiled spectrum of the vela pulsar demonstrates a strong , an order of magnitude , mid - ir flux excess , that progressively increases with the wavelength , as compared to the optical range .",
    "geminga shows a similar , though much less significant , excess , as follows from its marginal detection .",
    "it is important to note , that an intention of the flux increase towards the ir has been noticed by @xcite , when both pulsars were identified in the near - ir _ jh _ bands .",
    "however , the significance of that was low , and the presence of such a strong mid - ir excess was difficult to expect , based on the flat spectrum of the crab pulsar , that has been so far the only rotation - powered pulsar detected in the mid - ir .",
    "the mid - ir fluxes of the vela and geminga candidates are likely to be in agreement with their near - ir counterpart fluxes , confirming the reality of the apparent flux increases towards the ir , resulted early only from the near - ir data .",
    "thus , the compiled spectra appear to be real , but not the tentative ones .",
    "we consider this as an additional evidence , that the detected mid - ir emission is indeed associated with the pulsars .    accepting that , we can now update the rotational phase averaged spectral pictures for both pulsars in the whole observational range , from the radio to hard @xmath0-rays ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including our mid - ir data , and the data obtained recently with the _ fermi _ @xmath0-ray observatory @xcite .",
    "as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : mw1 ] , the flux density of the mid - ir emission from the vela pulsar becomes comparable with the density of the spectral bump produced by thermal emission from the atmosphere ( atm . ) at the surface of the ns visible in soft x - rays .",
    "at the same time , within large uncertainties it may be compatible with the long wavelength extrapolation of the nonthermal soft x - ray spectral tail detected with _",
    "chandra _ and the _ rxte _ and described by a power - law ( hatched region ) .",
    "the mid - ir flux upper limits are still lower than flux densities of a coherent radiation at radio frequencies .    similar spectral behaviour is observed for geminga .",
    "the main difference is that geminga is fainter in the optical / ir , and the observed mid - ir excess is much less significant .",
    "nevertheless , the steep ir flux increase towards low frequencies can not be excluded by the derived mid - ir flux upper limits .",
    "this suggests , that at several 10s microns the mid - ir flux density might be comparable with the soft x - ray thermal blackbody - like emission bump from the geminga surface ( bb ) and compatible with the low frequency extension of the nonthermal soft - x - ray spectral tail , as in the vela case .    however , from the spectral behaviour of both pulsars shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mw ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : mw1 ] , it is most likely that the _ spitzer _",
    "mid - ir observations reveal us a new spectral component in the emission of these rotation powered - pulsars , whose origin is different from those of the rest components detected early , and , perhaps , from that of the crab in the mid - ir .",
    "subarcsecond positional coincidence of the detected point - like object at 3.6 and 5.8 @xmath1 m with the vela pulsar coordinates suggests , that this object is likely to be the mid - ir counterpart of the pulsar .",
    "this is also supported by the consideration of its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , showing that the measured mid - ir fluxes are compatible with the long wavelength spectral excess observed early in the near - ir .",
    "the same is likely to be true for fainter geminga , with a caution that its mid - ir counterpart candidate is detected only marginally and solely in the 3.6 @xmath1 m band .",
    "additional confirmations can be obtained from near - ir detections of both pulsars in the _ k _ band , where they have not been observed , and by deeper mid - ir observations , to detect the geminga counterpart with a higher significance and to establish both identifications by proper motion measurements of the counterparts in this range and checking their consistence with the proper motions of the pulsars .",
    "extension of the pulsar observations to the far - ir would be also useful in this context .",
    "if our mid - ir identifications of the two pulsars are real , the question is what is the nature of the observed mid - ir flux excesses .",
    "besides the crab , where the excess is likely to be marginal @xcite , there are only two other isolated nss detected in the mid - ir .",
    "these are the axps 4u 0142 + 61 @xcite and 1e 2259 + 586 @xcite .",
    "both have been widely considered as radio - silent , and belong to a class of magnetars , i.e. , nss with extremely strong magnetic fields .",
    "they have significant mid - ir excesses , which have been interpreted as the emission from x - ray irradiated fall - back discs around the nss .",
    "such discs can be formed around isolated nss through a process of supernova fall - back @xcite .",
    "the marginal excess over the power - law extrapolation of the optical sed for the crab was suggested to be caused by a nearby pwn knot located in 06 from the pulsar .",
    "the knot is much fainter than the pulsar in the optical , but it has a very red spectrum with a steep flux increase towards the mid - ir , where the knot brightness can be comparable to that of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "this can result in an overestimation of the measured pulsar flux in this range , since the _ spitzer _ spatial resolution does not allow one to resolve the knot from the pulsar .",
    "a planet , or a cool low - mass stellar companion could also provide an excess .",
    "however , this is unlikely for our pulsars , since no planets or binary companions have been reported from timing observations of vela and geminga .",
    "finally , the observed excesses can be produced in magnetospheres of the pulsars .",
    "the latter possibility has also not been excluded for the magnetar 1e 2259 + 586 @xcite .",
    "below we discuss in more detail the possibilities listed above for the interpretation of the vela and geminga seds .",
    "we will focus mainly on the vela pulsar , whose mid - ir counterpart candidate is firmly detected .",
    "as protoplanetary discs around ordinary pre - main sequence stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or dust discs detected around white dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fall - back discs around pulsars can lead to emission excesses in pulsar spectra in the mid - ir and submillimetre bands @xcite .    to find out whether the vela and geminga spectral excesses can be explained by radiation from hypothetical discs around these objects , following @xcite",
    ", we consider passive dust discs heated by x - ray irradiation from the pulsars .",
    "we adopt a model of the irradiated disc emission from @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that there is enough gas to provide the pressure support for the dust , but its contributions to the heating balance due to a viscous dissipation and the emission are negligible . in this model",
    "the disc is optically thick and at a fixed disc radius it radiates as blackbody with a temperature depending on the radius @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the parameters determining the emission properties of the disc are the inclination angle @xmath16 , albedo @xmath17 , and the internal and external disc radii @xmath18 and @xmath19 . all of them can not be certainly constrained from the spectral fit to the observed ir seds containing only four points and upper limits .",
    "one has to select most critical ones to be found from the fit , and fix the others at reasonable values .",
    "albedo strongly affect the results and in our fits we fixed it using a set of values between 0.5 and 1 .",
    "we fixed also possible contributions from the pulsars in the ir , assuming that in this range their spectra are consistent with a power - law extrapolation from the optical  uv range .",
    "the observable disc properties depend also on the x - ray luminosity of the pulsar and its distance , which are known for our pulsars from previous studies : @xmath20 = ( 5.3@xmath210.5)@xmath2210@xmath23 erg s@xmath11 @xcite , @xmath24 = ( 3@xmath211)@xmath2210@xmath25 erg s@xmath11 @xcite , @xmath26 = 287@xmath27 pc @xcite , and @xmath28 = 250@xmath29 pc @xcite .",
    "uncertainty of the fit .",
    "the dotted line is the contribution from the thermally emitting disc with the best - fitting parameters . for the parameters",
    "see the text . ]    for vela the inclination angle can be fixed at @xmath30 , accounting for the viewing angle of the pulsar rotation axis , estimated based on the pwn geometry @xcite . within uncertainties",
    "this angle is compatible with that derived from the polarimetric radio observations of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "we assume , that the disc and pulsar rotation axes coincide with each other . as a result",
    ", the irradiated disc model provides a good fit for the vela sed at @xmath17 @xmath31 0.85 .",
    "an example is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : v - fit ] where we fixed @xmath17 at 0.75 . in this case @xmath32",
    "r@xmath33 , @xmath34 r@xmath33 , and the dust temperatures at the inner and external disc boundaries @xmath35 k , and @xmath36 k , respectively .",
    "the @xmath18 value derived from the fit is much larger than the pulsar light cylinder radius @xmath37 @xmath38 0.6@xmath2210@xmath39 r@xmath33 .",
    "this allows vela to work as the radio pulsar . at the same time it is about ten times smaller than that of axp 4u 0142 + 61 @xcite , suggesting a more compact disc around the vela pulsar than the disc around the axp , while the inner disc temperatures for both nss are similar and consistent with the sublimation temperature of dust @xmath12 1000 k. this is not a surprise , since the x - ray luminosity of the axp , 9@xmath2210@xmath40 erg s@xmath11 , is about three orders of magnitude higher than that of the vela pulsar , and the axp dust disc can survive only at larger distances from the ns .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 derived from the fit is in agreement with the inner disc boundary , that can be estimated independently from the dust destruction temperature , as it has also been noticed by @xcite for the 4u 0142 + 61 case .",
    "we also note , that our @xmath19 value is compatible with a condition @xmath19 @xmath4",
    "r@xmath33 found to be correct for almost all dust discs observed around white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath19 can not exceed the roche radius , within which any rocky object would be tidally disrupted @xcite .",
    "the roche radius for nss , as for white dwarfs , is about r@xmath33 .    if @xmath41 , then fall - back discs around isolated pulsars can be swept away by radiation pressure of the intensive magneto - dipole radiation of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown @xcite , that such a disc is not disrupted by this process , if @xmath18 @xmath4 @xmath42 and @xmath18 @xmath4 @xmath43 in cases of the orthogonal and aligned magnetic rotators , respectively . for vela our best fit value @xmath18",
    "@xmath38 @xmath44 lies in the middle of this range , providing stability of the disc against the radiation pressure at the angles between the magnetic and rotational axes of the pulsar @xmath4 10@xmath45 .",
    "this is in contrast to a value of @xmath2 70@xmath45 estimated from a combination of the pulsar polarimetric observations @xcite , and x - ray pwn geometry analysis @xcite .",
    "the latter value suggests the disruption of the disc , since at this angle we can not obtain any reasonable fit to the vela sed with @xmath18 , that is close enough to the @xmath37 value to satisfy the stability criterion . nevertheless ,",
    "if the vela pulsar is indeed closer to the orthogonal rotator , but not to the aligned one , the disc might still survive , if we assume that optically thin gas disc component exists inside @xmath18 , as it is for dust discs around pre - main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "this component can not contribute significantly to the ir emission , but may support the stability of the disc against the radiation pressure .",
    "at the same time , the problem of the dust disc structure and stability in the presence of a strong relativistic particle wind from energetic pulsars is still not resolved ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the presence of the planetary system orbiting psr b1257 + 12 @xcite strongly suggests that its formation must involve a preplanetary disc circling the ns . despite of many efforts @xcite , the most stringed upper limits on the dust disc emission in this system obtained with the _",
    "spitzer_/mips , suggests that the dust , if it really exists there , is significantly cooler than that derived by us for the vela pulsar and by @xcite for axp 4u 0142 + 61 .",
    "therefore , we conclude , that a simplified model of a passive dust disc can formally explain the ir excess for vela , but it is not clear , whether such a disc can survive around this energetic pulsar .",
    "we note also , that the vela ir sed can be roughly fitted by a pure blackbody model with @xmath46 k , and a blackbody radius of @xmath38 0.7 r@xmath33 .",
    "the latter one is too large for a planet or a cool brown dwarf .",
    "this is an additional argument against a cool binary companion of the pulsar as a source of the excess .",
    "we have carried out the similar analysis for geminga .",
    "the results are very uncertain due to larger uncertainties of its ir fluxes .",
    "we can note only that the fall - back disc around geminga can not be excluded by current data .",
    "the inner disc radius seems to be comparable with the geminga light cylinder radius , @xmath37 @xmath38 0.016 r@xmath33 , perhaps , suggesting the disc stability , that may lead to unstable behaviour of geminga as the radio pulsar @xcite",
    ". however , deeper ir studies are necessary to make any definite conclusions .      as in the crab case ,",
    "the ir excesses of vela and geminga may be produced by unresolved nearby structures of their pwne .",
    "there are two faint red structures in @xmath47 2  vicinity of the vela pulsar , which have been detected in the near - ir @xcite .",
    "they are projected on the x - ray pwn jet and counter - jet , and can be barely resolved in the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vela - ima-1 ] . for clearness the respective region is enlarged in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - o1fit ]",
    ". a knot - like object o1 is located @xmath3812 nw of the pulsar and detected in the _ h _ band .",
    "an extended @xmath3815 structure is located just se of the pulsar , partially overlapping with it , and detected in the _ j _ and _ h _ bands .",
    "both objects are not seen in the optical bands , and the se structure has showed some signs of a short - time variability in the near - ir @xcite .",
    "the sed of o1 with @xmath48 @xmath4 0.4 @xmath1jy and @xmath49 = 0.97(18 ) @xmath1jy can be extrapolated to the mid - ir using a power - law with a spectral index is defined as @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 . ] @xmath53 @xmath38 3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - o1fit ] ) .",
    "this fact , and the spatial separation of o1 from the pulsar , that is comparable to that of a nearby west star ( o3 , in @xcite notations ) visible in the mid - ir and optical ( cf .",
    "[ fig : vela - ima-1 ] ) , suggest that it could be detected in the _ spitzer_/irac bands at a similar brightness level as the pulsar candidate in the wing of its psf , whose mid - ir position and fwhm are marked by circles in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "[ fig : fig - o1fit ] , at the epoch of the near - ir observations the integral brightness of the se structure , with @xmath48 = 2.59(12 ) @xmath1jy and @xmath49 = 4.94(38 ) @xmath1jy , was higher than the brightness of the pulsar , while o1 was fainter .",
    "the spectral slopes of both structures are comparable to each other and to the spectral slope of the pulsar candidate in the mid - ir .",
    "since the se structure can not be resolved from the pulsar in the _ spitzer _ images , it can considerably contaminate the measured pulsar fluxes , assuming that the emission intensity of this structure in the mid - ir is compatible with the long wavelength extrapolation of its near - ir sed .",
    "this may be also supported by our astrometry , that shows a marginal shift of the mid - ir candidate position ( black circle in the image of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - o1fit ] ) from the near - ir counterpart centroid toward the se structure .",
    "we can then speculate , that the se structure can , at least partially , explain the observed excess , if this structure became fainter at the _",

    "[ fig : mw1 ] , the nonthermal magnetospheric emission dominates multiwavelength spectra of both pulsars from the radio to @xmath0-rays , except of a narrow range in soft x - rays , where the thermal radiation from the surfaces of the nss is more intensive .",
    "the spectra are mainly of a power - law , but their slopes are different in different spectral domains , and there are several spectral breaks , e.g. , between the @xmath0-rays and the hard x - rays , the soft x - rays and the optical , etc .",
    "these features are not yet clearly understood , and in this context , a new break between the optical and ir does not look very exclusive , and may represent an additional component of the ns magnetospheric emission .    except of the crab , three , of four young pwne so far identified in the optical  ir ( psr b0540@xmath569 , 3c 58 , and g292.0 + 1.8 , @xcite show strong mid - ir excesses with steep power - law spectral slopes in the ir .",

    "until the time , when timing observations of pulsars in the ir will be possible , imaging observation of other suitable rotation powered pulsars in the ir would be useful , to expand the sample of nss detected in this range and to verify , if the ir excess , like that of vela and geminga , is a more common feature in the pulsar emission , than a flat optical  ir sed of the crab .",
    "the inner torus - like pwne structures around the young crab , j1124@xmath55916 , j0205 + 6449 , and b0540@xmath569 pulsars are well identified in the optical and mid - ir @xcite .",
