    "in the seminal paper @xcite , berry demonstrated that a quantum system in a pure state that undergoes an adiabatic cyclic evolution can pick up a phase which is independent of the dynamics of the system .",
    "berry s publication began a , still ongoing , era of intensive research on holonomy effects in quantum theory , and some of the more important earlier papers on the topic have been reprinted in @xcite .",
    "there , for example , one can find @xcite , in which simon identifies berry s phase as a parallel transport holonomy in a hermitian line bundle over the parameter manifold of the system s hamiltonian , and @xcite , in which aharonov and anandan extend berry s result to the non - adiabatic cyclic case , and make explicit that berry s phase is due to the curvature of projective hilbert space .",
    "more recent applications of quantum mechanics in which holonomy effects play a crucial role include quantum information processing and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is believed that quantum computation implemented by holonomic quantum gates is intrinsically fault - tolerant and robust against noise @xcite .",
    "states of experimentally prepared quantum systems generally exhibit classical uncertainty .",
    "hence they are most appropriately described as mixtures of pure states .",
    "uhlmann @xcite was among the first to develop a theory for geometric phase for parallel transported mixed states .",
    "the theory is based on the concept of purification .",
    "another approach to geometric phase for mixed states , based on quantum interferometry , was proposed by sjqvist _",
    "_ @xcite . they derived , and carefully analyzed , an expression for the intensity of the output signal in a classical mach - zehnder interferometer , and from this they extracted a definition of geometric phase for mixed states .",
    "several experiments @xcite have been carried out that verify sjqvist _",
    "s results .",
    "a shortcoming of the definition of geometric phase given in @xcite is that it only applies to parallel transported nondegenerate mixed states . in the current paper",
    "we provide a geometrical framework , inspired by arguments of montgomery @xcite , in which geometric phase for unitarily evolving general mixed states has a natural definition .",
    "we show that this definition agrees with the definition in @xcite in those cases where their definition applies , and we derive an explicit formula for the geometric phase which can be easily implemented .",
    "our approach is thus particularly well suited for computations .",
    "the geometric phase for an evolving quantum system prepared in a pure state is undefined if the initial and final states are orthogonal . for quantum systems in mixed states",
    "a similar situation may occur . in a concluding section",
    "we introduce higher order geometric phases , and prove that under a generically satisfied condition there will always be a well - defined geometric phase of some order .",
    "we also relate the higher order geometric phases to the off - diagonal geometric phases studied by manini and pistolesi @xcite , and mukunda _ et al .",
    "mixed quantum states can be represented by density operators .",
    "a density operator is a self - adjoint , nonnegative , trace - class operator with unit trace .",
    "we write @xmath0 for the space of density operators on a hilbert space @xmath1 , and @xmath2 for the subspace of density operators with finite rank at most @xmath3 .",
    "a state is called pure if its density operator has rank @xmath4 . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "especially quantum information theory , _ purification _ refers to the fact that every density operator can be thought of as representing the reduced state of some pure state .",
    "indeed , one can show that if @xmath5 is a density operator acting on @xmath1 , there exists a hilbert space @xmath6 and a density operator @xmath7 representing a pure state in @xmath8 such that @xmath5 is the partial trace of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath6 . in this paper",
    "we only consider quantum systems whose states are represented by density operators with finite rank , and by the _",
    "standard purification _ of the density operators in @xmath2",
    "we mean the surjective map @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the space of linear functionals on @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the unit sphere in @xmath13 .",
    "evolving mixed states will be represented by piecewise smooth curves of density operators that , for convenience , are assumed to be defined on an unspecified interval @xmath14 .",
    "operators on @xmath11 will be represented by matrices with respect to the canonical basis , whose @xmath15 member we denote by @xmath16 .",
    "we write @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the @xmath19 identity matrix and zero matrix , respectively .",
    "when you purify a state you artificially add extraneous , perhaps inaccessible , information to your state .",
    "one way to get rid of this extra information is to use symplectic reduction .",
    "montgomery @xcite showed that if one does symplectic reduction on @xmath20 by the action of the unitary group of @xmath10 , then the reduced phase spaces can be identified with the ( co)adjoint orbits of isospectral density operators in @xmath2 , and the canonical reduced space submersions are given by certain spectral weighted eigenframe bundles .",
    "( a precise reformulation of montgomery s result will be given below . )",
    "we show that in this context , there is a natural definition of geometric phase for unitarily evolving mixed states which generalizes the definition of sjqvist",
    "_ but before we do that we need to translate montgomery s result into a language appropriate for our purposes",
    ". we begin by identifying @xmath13 with the space of linear maps from @xmath11 to @xmath1 , equipped with the hilbert - schmidt hermitian inner product .",
    "then the standard purification is given by @xmath21 .",
    "a density operator whose evolution is governed by a von neumann equation stays in a single orbit of the left conjugation action of the unitary group @xmath22 on @xmath0 .",
    "these orbits are in one - to - one correspondence with the set of possible spectra for density operators on @xmath1 , where by the spectrum of a rank @xmath3 density operator we mean the _ nonincreasing _ sequence @xmath23 of its , not necessarily distinct , _ positive _ eigenvalues . throughout",
    "we assume @xmath24 to be fixed , and we write @xmath25 for the corresponding orbit of density operators . also , we refer to the integer @xmath3 as the length of @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath26 be the diagonal @xmath19 matrix with diagonal @xmath24 , and define @xmath27 as the restriction of to @xmath28 .",
    "then @xmath29 is a principal fiber bundle with gauge group @xmath30 .",
    "we equip @xmath31 with the metric given by @xmath32 times the real part of the hilbert - schmidt hermitian inner product : @xmath33 .",
    "the vertical and horizontal bundles of @xmath29 are the subbundles @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , of the tangent bundle @xmath36 .",
    "the former consists of the kernels of the differential of @xmath29 , and the latter of the kernels orthogonal complements with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "vectors in @xmath34 and @xmath35 are called vertical and horizontal , respectively , and a curve in @xmath31 is called horizontal if all of its velocity vectors are horizontal .",
    "recall that for every curve @xmath5 in @xmath25 and every @xmath38 in the fiber over @xmath39 there is a unique horizontal curve @xmath40 in @xmath31 that starts at @xmath38 and projects onto @xmath5 .",
    "this curve is the _ horizontal lift _ of @xmath5 extending from @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath5 happens to be a closed curve , then the _ holonomy of @xmath5 with base point @xmath38 _ is the unique matrix @xmath41 in @xmath42 satisfying @xmath43 .",
    "we define the geometric phase of @xmath5 to be the argument of the spectral weighted trace of @xmath41 : @xmath44 observe that does not depend on @xmath38 because the holonomy of @xmath5 associated with a different base point is conjugate equivalent to @xmath41 in @xmath42 , and the matrices in @xmath42 commute with @xmath26 .",
    "inspired by the classical work of pancharatnam @xcite , samuel and bhandari @xcite generalized berry s phase to a relative geometric phase for non - cyclic unitary evolutions of pure quantum states .",
    "here we extend to a relative geometric phase for non - cyclic unitary evolutions of mixed quantum states .",
    "let @xmath5 be a curve in @xmath25 .",
    "the horizontal lifts of @xmath5 define a parallel transport operator @xmath45 $ ] from the fiber over @xmath39 onto the fiber over @xmath46 according to @xmath45\\psi_0=\\psi_{||}(\\tau)$ ] , where @xmath47 is the horizontal lift of @xmath5 extending from @xmath38 .",
    "we define the _ geometric phase factor _ and _ geometric phase _ of @xmath5 to be @xmath48\\psi_{0}\\right),\\label{geophasefactor}\\\\ & { \\gamma_{\\text{geo}}}(\\rho)=\\arg{\\zeta_{\\text{geo}}}(\\rho),\\label{geophase}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "observe that the geometric phase factor does not depend on @xmath38 since the right hand side of is invariant under the transitive action of the gauge group on the fiber over @xmath39 .",
    "definition reduces to if the curve is closed .",
    "however , for this definition to be useful in practice , we need a way to derive a horizontal lift from an arbitrary lift of a curve in @xmath25 . for this",
    "we need a connection form .",
    "the lie algebra of the gauge group is @xmath49 , and the infinitesimal generators of the gauge group yield canonical isomorphisms between @xmath50 and the fibers in @xmath34 : @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , the horizontal bundle is the kernel bundle of the _ mechanical connection form _",
    "@xmath52 defined by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the _ locked inertia tensor _ and _ moment map _ , respectively : @xmath56 if @xmath5 is a curve in @xmath25 , and @xmath40 is any lift of @xmath5 to @xmath31 , then the horizontal lift of @xmath5 that extends from @xmath57 is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the positive time - ordered exponential .",
    "the exponential factor in has a nice geometric interpretation ; it describes a curve in the gauge group @xmath42 whose continuous action on @xmath31 pushes @xmath40 onto a horizontal curve , see figure [ figure ] .        equations and give a truly general definition of geometric phase for unitary evolutions of mixed states .",
    "we will now derive an explicit formula for the geometric phase , suitable for computations .",
    "thus , let @xmath60 be the multiplicities of the _ distinct _ eigenvalues in @xmath24 , where @xmath61 is the multiplicity of the greatest eigenvalue , @xmath62 of the second greatest eigenvalue and so forth , and define @xmath63 diagonal matrices by @xmath64 a straightforward computation shows that @xmath65 for every vector @xmath66 tangent to @xmath31 at @xmath40 and @xmath67 in @xmath50 .",
    "hence , @xmath68 moreover , if @xmath69 is a time - evolution operator that generates @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath70 , we can take @xmath71 , where @xmath38 is any element in the fiber over @xmath39 . according to , , and , @xmath72      generically , a density operator of a mixed state is nondegenerate . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors gave a definition of geometric phase for _ parallel transported _ nondegenerate mixed states .",
    "we will quickly review it here , and then show that it is a special case of our definition .",
    "let the curve @xmath73 represent a unitary evolution of a nondegenerate density operator .",
    "following sjqvist _",
    "_ we say that the initial density operator @xmath39 is parallel transported provided all of its eigenkets are parallel transported : @xmath74 .",
    "the geometric phase of @xmath5 in the sense of @xcite is then the argument of the expected value of the relative phase factors for the eigenket curves : @xmath75    to show that generalizes , let @xmath5 be any curve in @xmath25 , @xmath47 be any horizontal lift of @xmath5 , and set @xmath76 .",

    "consider an ensemble of neutrons subjected to an external magnetic field , and assume that the ensemble is prepared so that the proportion of neutrons with spin up polarization is @xmath86 and the proportion with spin down polarization is @xmath87 , where @xmath88 .",
