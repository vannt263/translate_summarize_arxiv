    "let us consider a set @xmath7 of elements in a certain space and associated weights , @xmath8 , satisfying @xmath9 , @xmath10 , interpretable as a quantification of the relative importance or presence of these elements .",
    "the suitable choice of an element in the space to represent that set is an old problem present in many different settings .",
    "the weighted mean being the best known choice , it enjoys many nice properties that allow us to consider it a very good representation of elements in an euclidean space .",
    "yet , it can be highly undesirable for representing shaped objects like functions or matrices with some particular structure .",
    "the frchet mean or barycenter is a natural extension arising from the consideration of minimum dispersion character of the mean , when the space has a metric structure which , in some cases , may overcome these difficulties .",
    "like the mean , if @xmath11 is a distance in the reference space @xmath12 , a barycenter @xmath13 is determined by the relation @xmath14 in the last years wasserstein spaces have focused the interest of researchers from very different fields ( see , e.g. , the monographs @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) , leading in particular to the natural consideration of wasserstein barycenters beginning with @xcite .",
    "this appealing concept shows a high potential for application , already considered in artificial intelligence or in statistics ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the main drawback being the difficulties for its effective computation , several of these papers ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) are mainly devoted to this hard goal .",
    "in fact , the ( @xmath3)wasserstein distance between probabilities , which is the framework of this paper , is easily characterized and computed for probabilities on the real line , but there is not a similar , simple closed expression for its computation in higher dimension .",
    "a notable exception arises from gelbrich s bound and some extensions ( see @xcite , , @xcite ) that allow the computation of the distances between normal distributions or between probabilities in some parametric ( location - scatter ) families . for multivariate",
    "gaussian distributions in particular , in @xcite , the barycenter has been characterized in terms of a fixed point equation involving the covariance matrices in a nonlinear way ( see ( [ matrixeq ] ) below ) but , to the best of our knowledge , feasible consistent algorithms to approximate the solution have not been proposed yet .",
    "the approach in @xcite for the characterization of the barycenter in the gaussian setting resorted to duality arguments and to brouwer s fixed - point theorem . here",
    "we take a different approach which is not constrained to the gaussian setup .",
    "we introduce an operator associated to the transformation of a probability measure through weighted averages of optimal transportations to the set @xmath15 of target distributions .",
    "this operator is the real core of our approach .",
    "we show ( see theorem [ p1 ] and proposition [ basicineq ] below ) that , in very general situations , barycenters must be fixed points of the above mentioned operator .",
    "we also show ( theorem [ previoconsistencia ] ) how this operator can be used to define a consistent iterative scheme for the approximate computation of barycenters .",
    "of course , the practical usefulness of the iteration will depend on the difficulties arising from the computation of the optimal transportation maps involved in the iteration .",
    "the case of gaussian probabilities is a particularly convenient setup for our iteration .",
    "we provide a self - contained approach to barycenters in this gaussian framework based on first principles of optimal transportation and some elementary matrix analysis .",
    "this leads also to the characterization ( [ matrixeq ] ) and , furthermore , it yields sharp bounds on the covariance matrix of the barycenter which are of independent interest . we prove ( theorem [ normaliteration ] ) that our iteration provides a consistent approximation to barycenters in this gaussian setup .",
    "we also notice that all the results given for the gaussian family are automatically extended to location - scatter families ( see definition [ loc.scale ] below ) .",
    "finally , we illustrate the performance of the iteration through numerical simulations .",
    "these show fast convergence towards the barycenter , even in problems involving a large number of distributions or high - dimensional spaces .",
    "the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows .",
    "section 2 gives a succint account of some basic facts about optimal transportation and wasserstein metrics and introduces the barycenter problem with respect to these metrics .",
    "the section contains pointers to the most relevant references on the topic .",
    "section 3 contains the core of the paper , introducing the operator @xmath16 in ( [ gdefinition ] ) , showing the connection between barycenters and fixed points of @xmath16 and presenting the iterative scheme for approximate computation of barycenters .",
    "the gaussian and location - scatter cases are analyzed in section 4 , while section 5 presents some numerical simulations .",
    "we conclude this introduction with some words on notation . throughout the paper",
    "our space of reference is the euclidean space @xmath17 . with @xmath18",
    "we denote the usual norm and with @xmath19 the inner product . for a matrix @xmath20",

    "the related set @xmath28 will denote the subset of @xmath29 containing the probabilities that are absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure .",
    "the probability law of a random vector @xmath30 will be represented by @xmath31 .",
    "given @xmath32 , the ( @xmath3)wasserstein distance between them is defined as @xmath33 it is well known that this distance metrizes weak convergence of probabilities plus convergence of second moments , that is , @xmath34 we refer to @xcite for details . in the one - dimensional case",
    "@xmath35 is simply the @xmath36 distance between the quantile functions of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , allowing computation . in the multivariate case there",
    "exist just a few general results that can be used to simplify problems .",
    "an important example , which allows to deal with certain problems by considering only the case of centered probabilities is the following , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are arbitrary probabilities in @xmath42 , with respective means @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are the corresponding centered in mean probabilities .",
    "in any case , it is well known that the infimum in ( [ distancia ] ) is attained . a distribution @xmath45 with marginals @xmath37 and",
    "@xmath38 attaining that infimum is called an optimal coupling of @xmath37 and @xmath38 . moreover , if @xmath37 vanishes on sets of dimension @xmath46 , in particular if @xmath47 , then there exists an optimal transport map , @xmath48 , transporting ( pushing forward ) @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "this important result is the final product of partial results and successive improvements obtained in several papers including knott and smith @xcite , brenier @xcite , @xcite , cuesta - albertos and matrn @xcite , rschendorf and rachev @xcite and mccann @xcite .",

    "another remarkable consequence of the theorem is that optimality of a map is a characteristic that does not depend on the transported measures . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath48 is an optimal map for transporting @xmath37 to @xmath38 and @xmath71 are such that @xmath72 and the support of @xmath73 is contained in that of @xmath37 , then @xmath48 is also an optimal transport map from @xmath73 to @xmath74 : @xmath75 this fact allows the computation of the distance between some probabilities when we know that they can be related through optimal maps . it must be also noted that composition of optimal maps does not generally preserve optimality , but positive linear combinations and point - wise limits of optimal maps keep optimality .",
