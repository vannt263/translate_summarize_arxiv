    "a central objective of the study of @xmath0 meson decays is to help determine the phases and magnitudes of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , through the measurement of branching ratios and @xmath5-violating observables .",
    "it is important to have accurate and self - consistent information on ckm matrix elements if they are ever to be compared with fundamental theories predicting them . at present",
    "no such theories exist . a further objective is to learn about possible new physics at higher mass scales , affecting rare @xmath0 decays by giving observables that appear to be inconsistent with others .",
    "one wishes to know whether there are any sources of @xmath5 violation other than the phases in the ckm matrix first proposed by kobayashi and maskawa @xcite .",
    "charmless @xmath0 meson decays , many of whose branching ratios and @xmath5 asymmetries ( cpa s ) have been measured to good accuracy , are an interesting and useful set of modes . following the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 decays into a vector meson ( @xmath18 ) and a pseudoscalar meson ( @xmath1 ) , we analyze observables in @xmath0 decays into two pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath19 decays ) in the present paper . from the results of fits involving a small set of invariant amplitudes",
    ", one can extract information about the parameters in theory , compare with other known constraints , and predict as - yet - unreported observables .",
    "in particular , the amplitudes contributing to two - body hadronic charmless @xmath0 decays involve only one nontrivial weak phase @xmath16 within the standard model ( sm ) . in a previous analysis of @xmath17",
    "decays @xcite , we found good agreement between the favored range of @xmath16 from a fit to the @xmath20 modes and that from fits to ckm parameters @xcite based on other measurements .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to see if the @xmath21 modes give a consistent result .    in the present analysis , we take flavor su(3 ) symmetry as a working hypothesis . motivated by factorization in tree - level amplitudes , we take symmetry breaking due to decay constant differences into account in these amplitudes when relating strangeness - conserving and strange - changing processes .",
    "we leave the issue of su(3 ) symmetry breaking in penguin - type amplitudes to experimental data . as a test",
    ", one can compare the @xmath22 mode ( involving purely a strangeness - changing qcd penguin amplitude ) with the @xmath23 and @xmath24 modes ( involving purely strangeness - conserving qcd penguin amplitudes ) . in the limit of flavor @xmath25 symmetry",
    ", they should differ by a ratio of ckm factors , @xmath26 .",
    "if penguin amplitudes @xmath11 associated with intermediate @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks are important , the predictions for these modes will be affected .",
    "we find acceptable fits to @xmath3 and @xmath27 branching ratios and @xmath5 asymmetries with a combination of tree , color - suppressed ( @xmath6 ) , penguin ( @xmath1 ) , and electroweak penguin ( @xmath7 ) amplitudes .",
    "in contrast to an earlier analysis of @xmath19 decays @xcite , in order to describe these decays we must introduce a rather large value of @xmath28 and a non - trivial relative phase between @xmath6 and @xmath2 .",
    "a large @xmath28 value could improve agreement between the qcd factorization approach and experiment @xcite .",
    "our conclusion is driven in part by the large branching ratio for @xmath29 reported recently @xcite .",
    "the data on processes involving @xmath8 and @xmath9 also have made some progress since our earlier analysis @xcite .",
    "crucial additional terms for describing these decays include not only a large flavor - singlet penguin amplitude ( @xmath10 ) as proposed ( e.g. ) in refs .",
    "@xcite , but also a penguin amplitude @xmath11 associated with intermediate @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks , and ( for the @xmath14 mode ) a term @xmath15 associated with intermediate @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks .",
    "values of the weak phase @xmath30 are obtained consistent with our earlier analysis of @xmath17 decays @xcite .",
    "other robust aspects of our fit include the magnitude of the strangeness - changing penguin amplitude , the strong phase of the tree amplitude relative to the penguin ( @xmath31@xmath32 ) , the size of electroweak penguin contributions , the correlation of a large direct @xmath5 asymmetry in @xmath33 with a small one in @xmath34 , the correct prediction of signs and magnitudes of all other measured direct @xmath5 asymmetries as well , and a fairly large negative value of the time - dependent @xmath5 asymmetry parameter @xmath35 .",
    "some other aspects of the fit are less likely to remain unchanged in the face of further data ; we shall comment on them in due course .",
    "we review our conventions for the quark content of pseudoscalar mesons and topological amplitudes in section [ sec : not ] .",
