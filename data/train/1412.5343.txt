    "dyneins and kinesins are two important families of motor proteins called porters , responsible mainly for transport of various intra - cellular organelles .",
    "these motor proteins perform directed motion on microtubule filaments , typically with speeds of a few hundred nm / s .",
    "generally , dyneins move in retrograde direction while kinesins show anterograde motion .",
    "they also generate forces of few pn in order to drag and deliver different organelles from one place to other@xcite .",
    "motor driven cargo transport is complex phenomena due to involvement of multiple motor proteins in simulations pulling activity .",
    "often , presence of motors of both the directionality leads to saltatory motion of cargoes @xcite . in experiments ,",
    "observation that the oppositely polar motors engage in tug - of - war suggested the direct interaction through pulling cargo on which they are bound @xcite .",
    "in fact , in these experiments elongation of organelles is seen which is caused by tension generated during hauling mechanism .",
    "if the cargo is mechanically stiffer , both the teams of engaged motors experience an opposing load .",
    "this results in reduced velocity and faster detachment of motors from the filament affecting the statistics such as mean transport time of the cargo on the filament , average distance covered etc .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to understand how load exerted on a team of motors shared among the individuals .",
    "however , collective behavior of a set similar interacting motors attached on to a single cargo is so far not clearly understood . in order to probe this aspect , in a recent experimental study",
    ", motors were made to attach on to dna scaffold with controlled separation between motors @xcite .",
    "the velocity and the stall force of the dna scaffold was found be affected by varying the spatial separation between the motors , which suggests the presence of interaction mediated by the linker dna scaffold .",
    "the indication that the motors of the same directionality also interact is an important factor , as far as load sharing features of engaged motors and hence the statistics of the transport properties are concerned . while the exact form of interaction could be quite complex , development of simple tractable models based on simplified , but realistic interaction among the motors is desirable .",
    "one of the theoretical studies motivated our work in this front was the model by stukalin and kolomeisky @xcite in which the mean velocity and diffusion coefficient were calculated for two interacting helicase motor proteins .",
    "an interesting observation in the model was that , the interaction between the motors can enhance the mean velocity of the coupled motors .",
    "the interaction energy surmised in this model increases linearly with the separation between motors on the track .",
    "however , in the case of intra - cellular transport , the motor proteins and motor - driven membranous organelles like endosomes , mitochondria etc .",
    "are soft molecules with stiffness typically of the order of a few pn / nm @xcite . since motor proteins exert forces of few pn on these organelles , the elastic nature of motor - cargo assembly is likely to be an influential factor .",
    "unlike the model in @xcite , the energy considered here increases quadratically with the separation between the motors and , the number of motors pulling the cargo are not restricted to two .",
    "further , the organelles driven by these motors are under the influence of noisy thermal environment . considering all these in to account , here we study the role of elastic interaction between cargo bound multiple motor proteins on the statistical properties of the intra - cellular transport .    in the last few years",
    ", several studies have appeared , based ( mostly ) on a hookean spring - like interaction between motor and the cargo @xcite . in @xcite , along with elastic interaction among the motors , by assigning nonlinear force - velocity curve to different motors , average runlength of multiple motor driven cargo in the presence of external force is studied computationally at different motor stiffnesses . a more systematic semi - analytic study done by materassi _ et.al . _ @xcite reproduced the results in @xcite .",
    "one of the major aspect in this type of model is that , motors experience a stochastic dynamic force , as the elastic force is determined by the instantaneous separation between the motor and the cargo @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , rather than `` mean - field '' model in which load is assumed to be shared equally among the motors of same directionality ( see @xcite for details on `` mean - field '' model ) , stochastic load sharing model based on elastic motor - cargo interaction can explain unidirectional transport more reliably .",
    "they found , however , that both the models are not consistent with experimental observations of bidirectional transport . in another computational study , bouzat and falo @xcite",
    "have shown that the stall force of the cargo motor assembly is larger for non - interacting motors than the motors interacting through elastic strain force .",
    "in @xcite , tug - of - war between multiple opposing motors is investigated and it was shown that the mean velocity of the cargo is independent of the stiffness , whereas the mean runtime decreases with such parameter .",
    "a discrete state transition rate model employed in @xcite showed slight reduction in the two motor run length and velocity at larger stiffnesses , due to increase in the strain force . in a more recent study , berger _",
    "_ have identified distinct transport regimes in two elastically coupled motor proteins @xcite .",
    "four regimes were identified by comparing strain force with the single motor stall force and the detachment force .",
    "four other distinct regimes were found by comparing the time for spontaneous unbinding of motors from the filament with the time taken for motor - cargo system to build a force of the order of stall force and detachment force .",
    "some of the formalisms developed in above mentioned analytical studies are appropriate for at most two motor proteins driving a cargo @xcite , while many other studies are by and large computational in nature @xcite . adopting elastic interaction among motor - cargo complex , so far",
    ", a general satisfactory analytical approach has not been developed .",
    "particularly , how the load sharing features are effected in the presence of elastic coupling is not clearly known .",
    "how stall force depends on the stiffness of the motor - cargo linkers is not clearly understood .",
    "further , the effective diffusion coefficient of the motor - cargo system is likely to be different from free motor or cargo diffusion coefficient , and how this varies with number of motors on the cargo and elastic coupling is so far not known in detail .",
    "our analytical work presented here addresses some of these issues more systematically .    in this paper",
    ", we study the motion of a cargo particle , bound to @xmath0 motors through hookean springs .",
    "we develop a generic formalism based on the well - known system size expansion , which separates systematically the average behavior from fluctuations . because of its very nature",

    "we then make detailed comparisons between the predictions for the average velocity from both the models .",
    "further , a systematic study of fluctuations in the force experienced by each motor and their mutual correlations is carried out .",

    "we will now make specific choices for the functional form of motor hopping rates in the model , in such a way that the intrinsic asymmetry ( essential for directed transport ) in single motor rates is maintained , but the energy - dependence ( corresponding to motor - cargo interaction ) satisfies detailed balance .",

    "the left hand side is a straight line with slope equal to @xmath74 passing through origin .",
    "the right hand side is in general smooth monotonic function of @xmath65 .",
    "it varies from @xmath75 to @xmath76 as @xmath65 is varied from @xmath77 to @xmath78 in model i ( eq.[15 ] ) while in model ii ( eq.[16 ] ) , it varies from @xmath78 to @xmath77 ( see fig.[fig2 ] for schematic picture ) .",
    "therefore , as slope @xmath79 becomes larger and larger , the solution to the equation @xmath65 becomes smaller in magnitude ( sign is positive if @xmath80 and negative if @xmath81 ) .",
    "it suggests three different roles of @xmath82 and @xmath0 respectively in the transport mechanism .",
    "( a ) when @xmath19 becomes larger , cargo experiences a large drag force while motors try to pull it away .",
    "this increases the motor - cargo separation as @xmath19 increases .",
    "( b ) as @xmath83 is increased , the energy cost due to stretching increases , larger separation between motor and cargo is energetically unfavorable and this will enhance the backward hopping rate of the motor . as a result , we see reduction in mean stretch @xmath65 with increase in @xmath83 ( more details in next section ) .",
    "( c ) because all the motors are of same directionality , the number of springs which are connected in parallel increases ( on an average ) as @xmath0 is increased . due to additive nature of the spring constant in parallel springs ,",
    "stretching of motors results in large energy cost and hence the mean separation between motor and cargo decreases with @xmath0 .",

    "the average velocity and diffusion coefficient for this are given by @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "however , when multiple motor proteins are coupled through cargo , one may naively visualize whole system of motors as an effectual random walker pulling a cargo with modified hopping rates ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) and jump length ( @xmath102 ) .",

    "the scaling holds for a large range of stiffness , particularly when @xmath0 is large .",
    "however , as discussed already , the exact effective velocity and diffusion coefficient depend on the effective stiffness ( @xmath105 ) in a highly nonlinear manner .",

    "it is interesting to understand how force exerted on the cargo is shared among the cargo - bound motors ; in this context , it must be noted that both equal @xcite and stochastic @xcite load - sharing models of motor - protein transport have been studied in the literature .",
    "the present formalism allows us to characterize the statistics of force experienced per motor in a systematic way , within the constraints imposed by detailed balance .",

    "motor protein - driven cargo transport in eukaryotic cells is a complex and intriguing phenomenon due to the effective nonlinear interaction between bound motors on the cargo .",

    ", we regarded motor domains of these proteins as biased random walkers with fixed jump length , while the cargo subject , in addition to the elastic forces by motors , to thermal noise and an additional external force .",
    "two models were used to describe the elastic energy dependence of the hopping rates , which we refer to as model i and model ii .",
    "model i uses glauber - like dependence for elastic energy - dependence of hopping rates(eq.[15 ] ) , while model ii uses asymmetric exponential rates(eq.[16 ] ) . the master equation for the system",
    "is expanded to a linear fokker - planck equation ( lfpe ) using standard procedures @xcite .",

    ", a transcendental equation is obtained for mean motor - cargo separation . the solution to this",
    "equation yields various other quantities like the mean cargo velocity and average force experienced by the motor . by solving the fokker - planck equation for fluctuations ,",

    "the average force experienced by the motor deviates from the load per motor because of the elastic coupling ; the deviation is found to be more in model ii .",
