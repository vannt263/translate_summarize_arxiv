    "attempting to uncover the mix of stellar ages and metallicities within a composite system such as an elliptical galaxy can be compared to trying to puzzle out the recipe for an elaborate gourmet dish on the basis of appearance and aroma alone .",
    "the basic ingredients may be obvious , but without the benefit of actually biting in , deciding how to prepare and combine them to reproduce the final product is guesswork .    historically , most attempts at modeling the stellar populations within elliptical galaxies have concentrated on reproducing broad - band photometric colours using various ` empirical ' or ` evolutionary ' schemes ( e.g. , spinrad & taylor 1971 ; faber 1972 ; tinsley 1972 , 1978 ; bruzual 1983 ) to combine stars of different masses , metallicities , and/or ages .",
    "more recently , stellar population models have also included predictions for the absorption line strengths in the integrated spectra ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ; buzzoni 1995 ; weiss , peletier , & matteucci 1995 ; borges et  al .",
    "1995 ; vazdekis et  al .",
    "the combination of broadband colours and absorption line indices allows for better constraints on the stellar content of galaxies .",
    "however , the spectral indices reveal at least two clear shortcomings of stellar population synthesis : model populations of reasonable ages ( @xmath7gyr ) can not reproduce the weak balmer absorption indices observed in the more metal rich galactic globular clusters ( cohen , blakeslee , & ryzhov 1998 ; gibson et  al .  1999 ;",
    "vazdekis & arimoto 1999 ) and the model metal abundances do not match the ratios observed in giant ellipticals or metal - rich globulars , both of which exhibit enhancement of mg and the other alpha elements ( e.g. , peletier 1989 ; worthey , faber , & gonzalez 1992 ; vazdekis et  al .",
    "1997 ; worthey 1998 ; cohen et  al .",
    "moreover , because of the degenerate behaviour of the integrated colours and indices with respect to age and metallicity variations ( see worthey 1994 ) , even some of the successes of the models prove ambiguous .",
    "clearly , new insights beyond those afforded by the usual measures of the integrated stellar spectrum are needed for unraveling the stellar content of early - type galaxies .",
    "observations of surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) provide a powerful , and hitherto fairly neglected , class of constraints for stellar population models .",
    "the sbf method is most well known for studies of the extragalactic distance scale ( e.g. , tonry & schneider 1988 ; tonry , ajhar , & luppino 1990 ; tonry et  al .",

    "the implications of near - infrared sbf observations for distances and stellar populations have been discussed by luppino & tonry ( 1993 ) , pahre & mould ( 1994 ) , jensen , luppino , & tonry ( 1996 ) , and jensen , tonry , & luppino ( 1998 ) .",
    "blakeslee , ajhar , & tonry ( 1999a ) give a recent comprehensive review of the sbf method and its applications .",
    "more recently , liu , charlot , & graham ( 2000 ) have presented sbf predictions using a completely updated version of the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) stellar population models .",
    "their work allows for an up - to - date and independent ( appearing after this paper was submitted ) comparison to our own .",
    "sbf distances are based on a measurement of the quantity , the apparent magnitude of the luminosity - weighted mean luminosity of the individual stars within a galaxy .",
    "this mean luminosity , called , is a well - defined property of any stellar system in any given bandpass .",
    "sbf thus begins to provide some taste of the constituent stars of a galaxy .",
    "multiband sbf observations yield distance - independent ` fluctuation colours , ' e.g. , .",
    "the behaviour of the absolute sbf magnitudes and fluctuation colours , when plotted for instance against integrated colours , absorption indices , or each other , must be reproduced before any population synthesis model can be deemed fully successful .",
    "in the following section , we present new @xmath0-band sbf measurements for five galaxies in the fornax cluster .",
    "most sbf observations to date have been done in the @xmath2-band and near - ir bands , as the fluctuations in old stellar populations are much brighter in these bands and expected to show less scatter .",
    "the only sizable @xmath0-band sbf data  set so far published has been by tonry et  al .",
    "( 1990 ) for galaxies in the virgo cluster .",

    "this calibration , using  data from sodemann & thomsen ( 1995 ) and the mg@xmath5 measurements of davies , sadler , & peletier ( 1993 ) , is based solely on the internal gradients in ngc3379 .",
    "it is only strictly applicable over the range @xmath8 .",

    "calibration , but the zero  point is again 0.15mag too faint .",
    "although the scatter is small , calibrating the observations is much more difficult .",
    "it requires a well - orchestrated combination of imaging and spectroscopy , and absorption measurements are difficult well outside the bright galaxy centre .",
    "also , there is the unresolved ( and unmodeled ) issue over whether the colours , and sbf magnitudes for that matter , should follow the fe abundance or the mg overabundance .",
    "the consistency between the mg@xmath5 and  calibrations is illustrated in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : mg2cal ] .",
    "we can tie these two quantities together via their respective  calibrations , which for is based on @xmath1150 galaxies and for mg@xmath5  is based on one galaxy .",
    "the resulting ` empirical ' line , extended well beyond the true limits of applicability , almost perfectly overlays the model predictions . however , the agreement may be somewhat coincidental . a shift of only 0.02mag in the mg@xmath5 data for ngc3379 ( as , for instance , in the measurements by vazdekis et  al .",
    "1997 ) would eliminate the offset in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mg2cal ] and cause an offset in the lower panel . for a further comparison we show in the bottom panel galaxies in common between the sbf and smac ( smith et  al .  2000 ; hudson et  al .",
    "2000 ) surveys .",
    "the smac mg@xmath5 values have been shifted by @xmath10 mag as an approximate allowance for aperture effects .",
    "the galaxy points follow a shallower slope than the models , perhaps because of the increasing mg enhancement for redder , more luminous ellipticals .",

    "the selection by fluctuation colours decreases the rms scatters about eqs.([eq : jbar])-([eq : kbar ] ) by @xmath170% in each case .",
    "thus , a measurement of the actual scatter in a large and diverse sample of early - type galaxies could provide insight into the variety of the stellar mixtures in these galaxies .",
    "our model @xmath6-band zero point at @xmath13 is 0.240.36 mag fainter than the empirical one ( depending on whether the group or direct cepheid tie is used ) , which is based on measurements by jensen et  al .  (",
    "we should note that the @xmath6-band data are more weighted towards the red than the @xmath2-band survey data , so a better fiducial colour might be @xmath14 , in which case the zero  point discrepancy is 0.30.42mag .",
    "interestingly , the former padua isochrones ( bertelli et  al .  1994 ) , because of their more infrared luminous agb , make the model @xmath6 zero  point brighter by 0.5mag or more , i.e. , about 0.2mag brighter than the empirical zero point .",
    "however , the agreement becomes much worse in the @xmath2  band , with the theoretical zero point being 0.40.5 mag too faint because of the cooler rgb .",
    "again , all the same caveats apply as in  [ ssec : optcals ] with regard to the sensitivity of these calibrations to stellar evolution .",
    "clearly we will have learned much by the time the models reproduce the sbf data in all bands .",
    "it is noteworthy that the slopes of eqs.([eq : jbar])([eq : kbar ] ) are positive , i.e. , in the same sense as the slopes for optical sbf ( although the @xmath6-band slope is negative before the selection by fluctuation colours ) .",
    "this is in the sense opposite that given by either the worthey models or the liu et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) models , which both predict a brightening of the near - ir sbf magnitudes for redder populations .",
    "the dimming of our model near - ir sbf magnitudes in redder populations agrees better with observations ( jensen et  al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ) . in particular , we disagree with the conclusion by liu et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) that the @xmath6-band data imply that ellipticals all have roughly solar metallicity but a large spread in age . in the context of our models",
    ", the observed trend could well be due to metallicity variations .",
    "redder than @xmath14 , figure  [ fig : ircals ] shows a flattening of the predicted relations , so that a constant  calibration in the near - ir would work best for the reddest ellipticals .",
    "interestingly , just the opposite happens in the @xmath2-band , as we discuss in the following section .",
    "ajhar et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) measured sbf magnitudes in the wfpc2 f814w bandpass for 16 early - type galaxies observed with _",
    "hst_. although f814w is similar to cousins @xmath2 , the data gave a steeper slope of @xmath15 for the calibration against .",
    "in an effort to understand this , we have computed sbf magnitudes for our models in the wfpc2 filter system using the empirical and synthetic photometric transformations from holtzman et  al .",
    "unfortunately , the empirical transformations are only determined for stars with @xmath16 . for redder stars , including higher metallicity rgb stars ( the most important ones for us ) , they derived synthetic transformations using template stellar spectra and model bandpasses .",
    "it is this sort of theoretical transformation that we have sought to avoid in using the new vazdekis models , but here we are forced to it .    as holtzman et  al .",
    "discuss , their empirical and synthetic transformations do not always agree .",
    "however , we noticed that the two types of @xmath2f814w transformation intersect at @xmath17 .",
    "for consistency , we then shifted the @xmath0f555w and @xmath18f675w synthetic transformations by @xmath10.023mag into agreement with the empirical ones at @xmath17 .",
    "we used the empirical transformation for model stars bluer than this and the synthetic one for redder model stars . after transforming all the stars",
    ", we calculate the sbf magnitudes .",
    "figure  [ fig : hstdiffs ] shows the differences between the standard and wfpc2 @xmath0 and @xmath2 sbf magnitudes as a function of , and compares these differences to the stellar transformations . even though these are precisely the transformations used for the model stars in this colour range , there are systematic ( though small ) differences with the final sbf transformations .",
    "this should be no surprise : the spectrum of the fluctuations is quite different from a stellar spectrum , but it is a point often casually overlooked .",
    "figure  [ fig : f814cal ] shows the resulting relation between @xmath19 and  for the culled sample of composite models .",
    "it has the same overall 4.5 slope as in the standard @xmath2 band , and is shifted fainter by 0.06mag ( but this result depends on the uncertain synthetic transforms ) .",
    "however , there is a steepening of the relation starting around @xmath14 . to illustrate",
    ", we compute the running average of @xmath20 in  steps of 0.02 and plot the results in the figure .",
    "the ajhar et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) calibrating galaxies are distributed from @xmath13 to @xmath17 , with 75% being redder than 1.20 .",
    "this is because the wfpc2 images show only the red galaxy centres .",
    "the slope of the running averages at @xmath21 is 6.2 [ and changes by @xmath22 as the starting  is changed by @xmath23 , in good agreement with the ajhar et  al",
    ".  result .",
    "thus , these new models for the first time resolve the puzzle of the steeper f814w slope : it boils down to a slightly nonlinear relation coupled with differences in sample selection .",
    "recently , sbf - iv introduced the parameter  as the ratio , expressed in magnitudes , of the total apparent flux from a galaxy to the flux in the fluctuation signal .",
    "this ratio is independent of distance , photometric calibration , and extinction ; it corresponds to the total luminosity of a galaxy in units of a typical giant star within that galaxy : @xmath24 \\ , , \\label{eq : nbardef}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the total apparent magnitude and @xmath26 the total luminosity .",
    "put another way , if all stars in a galaxy were of magnitude , then  would be 2.5 times the logarithm of the total number of stars .",
    "sbf - iv therefore called  the `` fluctuation star count , '' but it is known to the authors for convenience as the `` tonry number . ''",
    "sbf - iv showed that  can be used as an alternative calibration in measuring sbf distances .",
    "the calibration they derived , adjusted to our group - based zero point (  [ ssec : vemp ] ) , is @xmath27 although this introduces covariance between  and , the final distance modulus is actually 14% less sensitive to errors in .",
    "moreover , the necessity of measuring to an accuracy of 0.022 mag in order to limit the distance error from photometry to @xmath28mag is replaced by the much less stringent requirement of measuring @xmath25 to an accuracy of 0.7mag .",
    "similarly , the sensitivity to errors in the galactic extinction is cut nearly in half for the  calibration .    however , sbf - iv cautioned against dropping  altogether in favour of .",
    "the  calibration is based purely on stellar population properties , whereas the  calibration essentially relies on the fundamental plane ( fp ) of elliptical galaxies and may be subject to systematic effects , such as environmental influences or the presence of a disk component .",
    "sbf - iv showed that  has a tight correlation with stellar velocity dispersion for sbf survey ellipticals : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is in km  s@xmath31 , and the scatter is 0.070 dex .",
    "the connection with the fp becomes transparent if we invert this relation to get @xmath32 eq.([eq : fabernbar ] ) superficially resembles the classical faber - jackson relation ( faber & jackson 1976 ) , but it contains an implicit correction for the mass - to - light ratio via the  term , with its strong stellar - population dependence .",
    "this explains why the scatter is similar to that of the inverse fp ( e.g. , hudson et  al .",
    "1997 ) , and less than half that of faber - jackson .    in order to model the behaviour of",
    ", we must assume some relation between the galaxy luminosity , or mass , and the stellar population .",
    "perhaps the most common form this takes is the mg@xmath5-@xmath30 relation ( dressler et  al .",
    "1987 ) , conventionally interpreted as a pure mass  metallicity relation ( e.g. , bender , burstein , & faber 1993 ; guzmn , lucey , & bower 1993 ; but see also trager et  al .",
    "however , we wish to avoid the use of mg@xmath5 here because it explicitly brings in the alpha - enhancement issue .    instead , we simply derive the following relation between the  colours of the sbf survey galaxies ( sbf - iv ) and the velocity dispersions of these galaxies from the homogenized smac sample ( hudson et  al .  2000 ) : @xmath33 details of the comparison of the sbf and fp parameters will be given by blakeslee et  al .",
    "( 2000 , in preparation ) .",
    "next we assume that the dynamical mass of a galaxy is given by @xmath34 ( e.g. , bender et  al .",
    "1992 ; jrgensen 1999 ) and make the zeroth - order assumption that all ellipticals have effective radii @xmath35 kpc .",
    "finally , we assume that the initial stellar mass is half the dynamical mass and then use the model mass - to - light ratios to derive @xmath26 and .",
    "figure  [ fig : nbar ] illustrates that our crude set of assumptions produces an -  relation very similar to the observed one .",
    "the slope of the composite model relation is 0.18 , while the empirical slope is @xmath36 , and the scatter is 0.095 mag ( the slope and scatter would change to 0.20 and 0.074 mag , respectively , if we culled as in the previous section ) .",
    "the zero points of the model and empirical relations are also similar in figure  [ fig : nbar ] , but this of course depends on the values assumed for @xmath37 and the fraction of the mass in stellar material .",
    "we have provided only a fairly schematic explanation , based on scaling laws , of why the  distance calibration works .",
    "a true theoretical calibration of this method must come from further developments in the semi - analytic modeling of early - type galaxy formation ( e.g. , cole et  al .",
    "1994 ; baugh , cole , & frenk 1996 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) .",
    "we have presented new @xmath0-band sbf measurements for five early - type galaxies in the fornax cluster . along with",
    "virgo and leo @xmath38 data from tonry et  al .",
    "( 1990 ) , these have been used to derive an empirical , cepheid - calibrated @xmath39-  distance indicator .",
    "the slope of this relation is @xmath40 , similar to the @xmath41-  empirical slope of 4.5 ( sbf - i ) .",
    "we find a mean fluctuation colour @xmath42 for our fairly homogeneous set of ellipticals , with a dispersion of only 0.15mag , comparable to the measurement error .",
    "new stellar population models , updated from those of vazdekis et  al.(1996 ) with the isochrones of girardi et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) and a new set of empirical transformations , have been employed to calculate sbf magnitudes and integrated colours for six different metallicities and a wide range of ages .",
    "the age - metallicity degeneracy in the optical -colour relations is less for these models than for the models of worthey ( 1994 ) , although there is still a high degree of degeneracy in the relation against mg@xmath5  at intermediate and high metallicities . in the near - ir bands , the model sbf magnitudes have much shallower dependences on colour / metallicity .",
    "below solar metallicity , they depend solely on age , while the integrated colour depends almost solely on metallicity .",
    "thus , the  vs.  @xmath43 plot completely breaks the age - metallicity degeneracy for the lower metallicity models .",
    "this could be an important new avenue in stellar population studies .",
    "we have examined the sensitivity of our sbf predictions to changes in the isochrones , theoretical - to - observational transformations , and the imf .",
    "we find that using the former set of padua isochrones makes the sbf magnitudes 0.10.2mag fainter in the optical and about 0.5mag brighter in the near - ir .",
    "using theoretical transformations instead of our empirical ones can change the  predictions by nearly 0.5mag and  by up to 0.7mag ; the changes for the other bands are at the 0.10.2 mag level .",
    "thus , the isochrones and the transformations have about equal importance for the sbf results .",
    "on the other hand , different imfs yield fairly similar -colour relations in the optical because the imf effects are largely degenerate with age and metallicity , as noted by worthey ( 1993a ) .",
    "this is less true in the near - ir , where the steeper imf still makes the model colour redder ( like metallicity ) and  fainter ( like age ) , but age and metallicity are no longer degenerate .",
    "the  and  magnitudes of our low metallicity models have been tested against observations for 19 globular clusters .",
    "the models agree fairly well , especially if younger ages are taken at higher metallicities , with the data in both zero point and metallicity dependence , which is very weak in the @xmath2-band .",
    "model calculations at lower metallicities and sbf measurements of higher metallicity globulars ( if possible ) would allow for much better tests .",
    "at any single metallicity , the models predict an anticorrelation between  fluctuation colour and integrated  colour : increasing the age makes  bluer and  redder , although they both become redder with increasing metallicity .",
    "the models further imply that the observed spread in  at a fixed should be interpreted as a spread in age among the globulars . however , some of the globulars are too blue in   ( and thus too old ) to be match models",
    ". this could in part be due to errors in the extinction estimates . at high metallicities ,",
    "the models predict @xmath44 , in good agreement with the observations of elliptical galaxies .    because the single - metallicity",
    ", single - age models do not yield completely monotonic relations between  and colour , we adopt a monte carlo approach to making composite population models from three metallicity bins with different ( fairly loose ) restrictions on age .",
    "we then select out the models that reproduce the observed ( distance - independent ) fluctuation colours of early - type galaxies .",
    "this procedure reproduces well the  colour range of elliptical galaxies and the empirically well - determined slope of  against .",
    "if we reduce the mean number of metal poor stars in the models from 10% to 5% , the @xmath2-band sbf slope becomes marginally too steep , and steeper than the @xmath0-band slope , contrary to observations .",
    "this is due to the flattening of the -  relation in bluer populations , seen in both the data and our models , and is a palpable indication of the presence of metal - poor stars in early - type galaxies .",
    "similarly , we find that the @xmath2 slope becomes steeper for redder composite populations , those with few metal - poor stars .",
    "this explains the steep slope found by ajhar et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) for _ hst _ f814w observations of elliptical galaxy centres , which are usually quite red .    although the slopes of the model -  relations are fairly sensitive to the details of the composite model prescription , the zero points at @xmath13 are not",
    "the zero point of the model calibration is only 0.03 mag brighter than the empirically determined zero point from  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "if the ` direct ' ( but observationally more precarious ) tie of sbf to the cepheid distance scale via spiral bulges were adopted instead of the group tie , then the theoretical calibration would be 0.09 mag fainter than the empirical one .",
    "the theoretical  zero point is 0.15 mag fainter than the empirical one ( or 0.27 mag for the direct tie ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cepheid distance scale were revised to match the dynamically measured distance to the water maser in ngc4258 , then the theoretical and empirical  zero points would agree closely ( at the expense of the empirically less secure  calibration ) .",
    "our theoretical  calibration is @xmath10.35mag fainter than the calibration given by the worthey models ; this difference appears to stem from the different isochrones used in the two sets of models .",
    "the variation of  with mg@xmath5 for the models is in good accord with that obtained by thomsen et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) from the internal gradients of ngc3379 .",
    "again , the theoretical zero point is 0.15mag fainter than observed .",
    "this relation is predicted to have less scatter than the calibration against , but the distances would be much more challenging from an observational point of view , unless the sbf measurements are restricted to the bright galaxy centres , as for example with _",
    "hst _ imaging .",
    "also , the models do not include the effects of mg overabundance on either the linestrength predictions or the isochrone temperatures , and it is unclear how this would affect the theoretical calibration .",
    "our composite modeling predicts that the slope of the near - ir -relation will have the same sense as in the optical , in contrast to the predictions of the worthey ( 1994 ) models and the liu et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) models .",
    "our predicted relation then becomes nearly flat for @xmath45 , ( just the opposite of the behaviour seen in the @xmath2  band ) .",
    "the slope of our derived relations depends on our procedure for selecting out composite models based on their fluctuation colours .",
    "the selection criteria also greatly reduce the scatter in the near - ir -  relations .",
    "observational studies of the true slope and scatter , and further investigation into the range of fluctuation colours among elliptical galaxies , would be important from the standpoint of both stellar population and distance studies .",
    "the @xmath46 zero point given by our models is 0.24 mag fainter than the empirically calibrated one ( or 0.36 mag fainter with the direct tie ) .",
    "this discrepancy depends strongly on the temperature structure of the isochrones , including the agb .",
    "finally , we have used mass - colour scaling relations to investigate the recently - introduced tonry number , which describes the luminosity of a galaxy in units of a typical giant star .",
    "the simple scaling relations combined with the stellar population models can reproduce the observed dependence of  on  from sbf - iv .",
    "however , a true theoretical calibration of this form of the sbf method requires more physically - motivated evolutionary models .",
    "overall , our model sbf predictions are consistent with observations at the @xmath10.2mag level in the optical and at the @xmath10.3mag in the near - ir .",
    "the present uncertainties in the empirical calibrations are thought to be about a factor of two smaller than this .",
    "these results therefore present challenges for stellar evolution and population synthesis .",
    "we have noted that sbf magnitudes are acutely sensitive to the distribution and properties of evolved stars , particularly on the rgb , which in turn are sensitive to fairly ill - constrained things such as the colour - temperature scale for the coolest stars , the helium fraction , the prescription for convection , variations in elemental abundance ratios , diffusion , etc .",
    "however , it is precisely this sensitivity that gives sbf its own unique vista , as compared to more traditional observables , and should make multi - band sbf observations an important constraint for future stellar population .",

    "we thank guy worthey for making his stellar population models accessible via the world wide web and the padua group for making their isochrones electronically available .",

    "<S> we investigate the use of surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) measurements in optical and near - ir bandpasses for both stellar population and distance studies . </S>",
    "<S> new @xmath0-band sbf data are reported for five galaxies in the fornax cluster and combined with literature data to define a @xmath0-band sbf distance indicator , calibrated against cepheid distances to the leo group and the virgo and fornax clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the colour dependence of the @xmath0-band sbf indicator is only @xmath115% steeper than that found for the @xmath2-band , and the mean ` fluctuation colour ' of the galaxies is @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> we use new stellar population models , based on the latest padua isochrones ( girardi et  al .  </S>",
    "<S> 2000 ) transformed empirically to the observational plane , to predict optical and near - ir sbf magnitudes and integrated colours for a wide range of population ages and metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the sensitivity of the predicted sbf  colour relations to changes in the isochrones , stellar transformations , and initial mass function . </S>",
    "<S> the new models reproduce fairly well the weak dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath2 sbf in globular clusters on metallicity , especially if the more metal - rich globulars are younger . below solar metallicity </S>",
    "<S> , the near - ir sbf magnitudes depend mainly on age while the integrated colours depend mainly on metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> this could prove a powerful new approach to the age - metallicity degeneracy problem ; near - ir sbf observations of globular clusters would be an important test of the models .    the models also help in understanding the  and  fluctuation colours of elliptical galaxies , with much less need for composite stellar populations than in previous models . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to obtain theoretical calibrations of the sbf distance indicators , we combine the homogeneous population models into composite models and select out those ones with fluctuation colours consistent with observations . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to reproduce the observed range of elliptical galaxy  colours , the slopes of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 sbf distance indicators against  ( fainter sbf in redder populations ) , and the flattening of the @xmath2-band relation for @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the models also match the observed slope of @xmath2-band sbf against the mg@xmath5 absorption index and explain the steep colour dependence found by ajhar et  al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1997 ) for the _ </S>",
    "<S> hst_/wfpc2 f814w - band sbf measurements . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous models , ours predict that the near - ir sbf magnitudes will also continue to grow fainter for redder populations .     </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical @xmath0-band sbf zero point predicted by these models agrees well with the cepheid - calibrated @xmath0-band empirical zero  point . </S>",
    "<S> however , the model zero  point is 0.150.27mag too faint in the @xmath2-band and 0.240.36mag too faint in @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the zero points for the @xmath2  band ( empirically the best determined ) would come into close agreement if the cepheid distance scale were revised to agree with the recent dynamical distance measured to ngc4258 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the theoretical sbf calibrations are sensitive to the uncertain details of stellar evolution and conclude that the empirical calibrations remain more secure . </S>",
    "<S> however , the sensitivity of sbf to these finer details potentially make it a powerful , relatively unexploited , constraint for stellar evolution and population synthesis .    </S>",
