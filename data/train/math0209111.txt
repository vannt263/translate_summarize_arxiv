    "the motivating example of a real locus is a complex variety @xmath0 under complex conjugation @xmath3 . in this case , the real locus is the set of real points on the variety . by ( [ eq : anticommute ] ) the subgroup of @xmath2 of elements of order 2 acts on @xmath13 .",
    "we call this subgroup @xmath14 , the _ real torus _ in @xmath2 .",
    "it is immediate that @xmath15 .",
    "duistermaat @xcite proved that the real locus has full moment image , that is , that @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , he showed that the components of the moment map are morse - bott functions for the real locus , when using @xmath17 coefficients , and so we can understand the topology of @xmath13 via the moment map .",
    "biss , guillemin and the second author @xcite proved that these moment map components can also be used to understand the equivariant topology of the real locus with respect to the restricted @xmath14 action .",
    "in addition , sjamaar and oshea have generalized the results of duistermaat for hamiltonian actions of nonabelian lie groups @xcite .",
    "the principle behind these results is that real loci should behave in a fashion similar to the symplectic manifolds of which they are submanifolds .",
    "we show that this philosophy applies in the context of symplectic reductions .    given a compact hamiltonian @xmath2-space @xmath0 , kirwan @xcite proved that when @xmath2 acts freely on @xmath18 , the inclusion map @xmath19 induces a surjection in equivariant cohomology with rational coefficients : @xmath20 the map @xmath21 is called the kirwan map . in @xcite",

    "then the map ( [ eq : surjection ] ) is surjective with integer coefficients . for higher dimensional @xmath2",
    ", the authors assume the action is quasi - free to prove kirwan s surjectivity over @xmath24 , although this is stronger than necessary .",
    "one natural question is , what is the kernel of @xmath21 ?",
    "this question was answered in @xcite and refined by the first author in the case of rational coefficients @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 has the additional structure of an anti - symplectic involution , compatible with torus action as specified above .",
    "suppose also that @xmath27 is nonempty . in this article",
    "we prove a surjectivity result for real loci analogous to kirwan s result ( theorem  1 ) .",
    "we also use tolman and weitsman s equivariant morse theoretic methods to compute the kernel of this real version of the kirwan map ( theorem  2 ) .",
    "thus the main contribution of this article is to complete the program begun by duistermaat in showing that the real locus of a hamiltonian @xmath2-space has a @xmath28-action which behaves as if it were itself a hamiltonian @xmath2-space .",
    "not only is the equivariant cohomology ring of @xmath13 described by restrictions to fixed points , but there is a well - defined notion of  real reduction \" and the major theorems about the cohomology rings of reduced spaces go through in the real case .",
    "the proofs we present are straightforward extensions of the work of atiyah - bott , kirwan , and tolman - weitsman to the real case .",
    "we then explore the ramifications of real reduction and these theorems in a series of examples .",
    "the key to kirwan s proof of surjectivity is the analysis of the function @xmath29 in the case of @xmath30 , this is not a morse function , but it is morse - bott except at @xmath31 , the function s minimum value . for @xmath32 , there are a finite number of critical values of @xmath33 where @xmath34 is not morse - bott , in addition to the minimum",
    ". moreover , @xmath35 kirwan uses the critical sets of @xmath36 to argue inductively ( on the critical sets ) that the equivariant cohomology of @xmath0 surjects onto the ordinary cohomology of @xmath37 .",
    "it is clear that surjectivity for general values @xmath38 of @xmath33 follows by shifting the moment map by an appropriate constant .",
    "these arguments easily go through when the function is restricted to the real locus , as we will see .",
    "a fundamental step in the proof of surjectivity and the computation of the kernel is a lemma due to atiyah and bott @xcite .",
    "this lemma describes the local topology , in and around a fixed point component of @xmath25 . under the hypothesis of no 2-torsion ( definition  [ def:2torsion ] )",
    "we show that this lemma still holds for @xmath28-cohomology with @xmath17 coefficients .",

    "let @xmath55 be the weights of the irreducible representations obtained by this action on the fiber over @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath23 is a 2-torsion point if and only if @xmath56 is trivial for some @xmath57 .",
    "the functions @xmath58 and a family of perturbations ( see section [ se : kernel ] ) have critical sets fixed by various subtori of @xmath2 . tolman and weitsman prove @xmath59 is a surjection provided that @xmath2 acts quasi - freely .",
    "as they note , one needs to ensure that the negative normal bundles to all critical sets of these functions have nontrivial equivariant euler classes .",
    "for the real locus case ,  no 2-torsion points \" plays the same role as  quasi - free \" does in the symplectic case . at the critical sets of this family of functions , the negative normal bundles have top stiefel - whitney classes which are nontrivial in the @xmath60-component of @xmath61 for each connected component @xmath45 of the critical set .",
    "this amounts to the requirement that , over any point in @xmath45 , the negative normal bundle splits into one - dimensional _ nontrivial _ representations of @xmath14 .",
    "the condition that @xmath13 contain no @xmath62-torsion points ensures this for the family of perturbations of @xmath58 .",

    "in this section we discuss equivariant cohomology and the thom isomorphism in @xmath17 coefficients .",
    "we then state a topological lemma ( lemma 2.1 ) that plays an important role in the proofs of theorems 1 and 2 .",

    "as a result of kirwan s surjectivity for symplectic reductions and theorem  [ th : surjectivity ] , we have two short exact sequences in equivariant cohomology , with @xmath17 coefficients : @xmath290 & k \\ar[r]^<<<<<{\\kappa } & h_t^{2*}(m;{\\mathbb z}/2{\\mathbb z})\\ar[r]\\ar@{=}[d ] &      h^{2*}(m/\\!/t(\\mu);{\\mathbb z}/2{\\mathbb z})\\ar[r ] & 0 \\\\ 0\\ar[r ] & k_{{\\mathbb r } } \\ar[r]^<<<<<{\\kappa_{{\\mathbb r } } } & h_{{t_{{\\mathbb r}}}}^{*}(q;{\\mathbb z}/2{\\mathbb z})\\ar[r ] &      h^{*}(q/\\!/{t_{{\\mathbb r}}}(\\mu);{\\mathbb z}/2{\\mathbb z})\\ar[r ] & 0 . } \\ ] ] the tolman - weitsman theorem and theorem  [ th : kernel ] imply that the generators of @xmath477 and @xmath73 are identified under the equality .",
    "for example , figure  2 demonstrates the class @xmath474 which is a degree @xmath62 class in @xmath478 and is a degree 1 class in @xmath479 , for the @xmath38 and @xmath224 shown .",

    "this result is analogous to duistermaat s original result on the topology of real loci , ; however @xmath77 may not have a hamiltonian torus action .",
    "thus this example extends duistermaat s result to symplectic reductions .      in the symplectic",
    "setting , a toric variety is a compact symplectic @xmath481-dimensional manifold with an effective hamiltonian @xmath63-action .",

    "the action of @xmath492 on @xmath491 certainly satisfies these assumptions .",
    "indeed , an equivariant extension of kirwan s surjectivity , due to the first author @xcite , can also be applied , giving a map @xmath493 where @xmath494 .",
    "the kernel computation does not go through in the same way , but we have an alternative description of @xmath495 which allows us to compute the kernel for real loci of toric varieties .",
    "we can compute the equivariant cohomology of toric varieties using a combinatorial description due to goresky , kottwitz and macpherson @xcite .",
    "provided @xmath485 has no 2-torsion , this combinatorial description also holds for real loci @xcite , and so we know that as rings , @xmath496 moreover , this equality commutes with the two surjections , giving a commutative diagram @xmath290 & k = i\\ar[r ] & h^{2*}_{t^d}({\\mathbb c}^d;{\\mathbb z}/2{\\mathbb z } ) \\ar@{=}[d]\\ar[r ] &                        h^{2*}_{t^n}({\\mathbb c}^d/\\!/t^k;{\\mathbb z}/2{\\mathbb z } ) \\ar@{=}[d]\\ar[r ] & 0 \\\\ 0\\ar[r ] & k_{{\\mathbb r}}\\ar[r ] & h^{*}_{{t_{{\\mathbb r}}}^d}({\\mathbb r}^d;{\\mathbb z}/2{\\mathbb z } ) \\ar[r ] &                        h^{*}_{{t_{{\\mathbb r}}}^n}({\\mathbb r}^d/\\!/{t_{{\\mathbb r}}}^k;{\\mathbb z}/2{\\mathbb z } ) \\ar[r ] & 0            } \\ ] ] thus , by the five lemma , @xmath497 .",
