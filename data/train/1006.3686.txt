    "hydrogen is an ubiquitous element , present even in ultra - high - vacuum chambers , although very difficult to detect .",
    "it shows a large sticking probability in most transition metal surfaces @xcite , among them co. adsorption of h on transition metals was intensively studied in the past decades , mainly motivated by the understanding of the action of residual gases in catalytic and embrittlement processes .",
    "much less attention has been paid to the influence of h on the magnetic properties , though it is known to have a remarkable effect .",
    "for example , the adsorption of h@xmath0 molecules on the surface of magnetic transition metals produces a reduction of surface magnetism @xcite .",
    "in addition , h coverage shifts the critical thickness for the spin reorientation transition ( srt ) of ni films @xcite , and a reversible manipulation of the magnetic exchange coupling of fe / v superlattices can be achieved upon loading the v layers with h @xcite .    previous experimental results characterizing the structure and energetics of h adsorption on different co surfaces and nanostructures with two - dimensional ( 2d ) 3-fold symmetry , as co(0001 ) @xcite or co nanoislands on cu(111 ) @xcite , indicate that h prefers adsorption sites preserving the symmetry of the 2d lattice .",
    "this is in agreement with _",
    "ab initio _ calculations of the hcp co(0001 ) termination @xcite . even for co(@xmath1 )",
    "the formation of superstructures leading to adsorption sites of 3-fold symmetry has been reported @xcite .",
    "the evaporation of molecular h@xmath0 on different co surfaces results in the dissociative chemisorption of h atoms up to a monolayer ( ml ) completion @xcite . for higher doses , molecular h@xmath0 physisorption occurs .",
    "the desorption of h from co nanoislands on cu(111 ) takes place locally and leaves the co surface as it was prior the h evaporation , in contrast to the substrate exposed areas @xcite .",
    "this surface character of the h - co interaction is also supported by total energy calculations , which show a negligible weight of the h induced states even in subsurface co atoms @xcite . in addition , no dependence of the binding energy on the h coverage is obtained @xcite . moreover , h subsurface sites are highly unstable , indicating a low probability for h diffusion to the bulk .    as compared to other transition metal surfaces , there are only a few studies of the influence of h on the electronic and magnetic properties of co surfaces and thin films .",
    "spectroscopic measurements indicate a quenching of the @xmath2-like surface states and a shift of the @xmath3 surface states downward in energy upon h adsorption @xcite . moreover , the co electronic properties can be tuned individually controlling the amount of adsorbed h @xcite .",
    "the calculated density of states ( dos ) also indicates that h states appear below the @xmath3 valence band ( vb ) @xcite .",
    "when spin - polarization is included , it can be shown that this results in the quenching of the surface - induced enhancement of the co spin moment , at least for 1 ml of h coverage @xcite .",
    "recently , we studied the magnetic properties of ultrathin co films grown on ru(0001 ) @xcite .",
    "this is a unique system showing a double srt linked to the completion of co atomic layers . the srt is intimately related to the structural distortion of the ultrathin co film .",
    "both co and ru are hcp metals , but with very different lattice parameters : 2.51   and 2.71  , respectively .",
    "while 1 ml of co grows epitaxially , the second layer starts compressing towards the co lattice , leading to an intermediate 2d lattice parameter of 2.6  . in this work",
    "we study the influence of h adsorption on the structural , electronic and magnetic properties of these ultrathin co / ru(0001 ) films , with special emphasis on the 2 ml thick ones which show perpendicular magnetic anisotropy",
    ". the study of the magnetic anisotropy will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "our results indicate that h bonds strongly to the surface and tends to form a complete overlayer leading to a very stable surface system .",
    "partial h coverage , although thermodinamically stable , presents slightly smaller energies of adsorption . as we will show , while 1 ml of h quenches the surface magnetism , lower h coverage may enhance it .",
    "this can be a crucial factor regarding the role of residual h in the measured magnetic properties of co surfaces .",
    "we have performed _ ab initio _ calculations within the local density approximation ( lda ) , combining two different approaches .",
    "first , we have performed an exhaustive search of the equilibrium adsorption positions of h using slab models , a plane - wave basis set and the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite as implemented in the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite . for the most stable configurations",
    ", we have then determined the electronic and magnetic properties within the fully - relativistic framework of the screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( skkr ) method @xcite , which allows for a smooth matching of the surface region to the semiinfinite bulk and lacks of the quantum size effects inherent to slab models .    for the calculations with vasp , an energy cutoff of 350 ev has been used .",
    "the structures are modeled by periodically repeated slabs of 6 to 10 ru layers covered by 2 co mls on one side , and adding 1/4 ml or 1 ml of h on top of or underneath the outermost co layer .",
    "a vacuum region of 12   is left between both slab surfaces which prevents any spurious interaction between them .",
    "this model also guarantees the recovery of the bulk properties at the inner ru layers of the slab .",
    "the search for the most stable h adsorption sites has been performed starting from different h geometries and allowing full relaxation of the atomic positions of h , co and the outermost ru layer .",
    "a uniform sampling of the k - mesh centered in @xmath4 has been used , and convergence for the most stable structures has been obtained using k - samplings of up to ( @xmath5 ) for @xmath6 geometries and ( @xmath7 ) for the @xmath8 unit cells corresponding to adsorption of 0.25 ml of h. under these conditions , convergence in total energy differences below 1 mev is achieved .    by using the optimized geometry with the most stable h adsorption sites , the detailed electronic structure and the magnetic moments were calculated in terms of the fully relativistic skkr method.@xcite the skkr formalism provides , in a natural way , layer - resolved physical quantities such as charges and magnetic moments .",
    "it , thus , manifests a perfect tool for the analysis of the h - co interactions , and of the influence of the co film thickness in the h induced properties . for this purpose",
    ", we have extended our calculations to films of 3 to 6 co mls .",
    "details of the skkr calculations for the co / ru system can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the h atom is modeled by using an atomic sphere of radius 0.59  , placed at the equilibrium distance to co determined by vasp .",
    "the stable adsorption site of h on 2co / ru(0001 ) has been explored starting from different geometries , depicted in figure [ hposit ] : top , bridge , hollow ( either fcc or hcp ) and off - symmetry positions , both at surface and subsurface sites .",
    "in addition , for 1 ml coverage , the influence of structural modifications present in the co film has been considered , such as the variation of the 2d lattice parameter , or the existence of stacking faults which alter the co / ru stacking sequence from the hcp ab / ab to bc / ab @xcite .        a summary of the results is compiled in table [ tstruc ] . in all cases , the most stable adsorption site corresponds to h at fcc hollow surface positions .",
    "the table shows the energy difference with respect to the equilibrium configuration only for the most stable structures .",
    "the rest of geometries considered , including on - top positions , provide total energies larger by more than 1 ev . our results are in good agreement with previous ones relative to different co surfaces and thin films @xcite : h tends to stick at the surface trying to preserve the 3-fold symmetry of the co lattice , independent of the detailed co film structure or the h coverage .",
    "the energy difference between adsorption sites provides an estimate of the diffusion barriers for h in the surface .",
    "although the trends are similar for all surfaces studied , partial h coverage or alteration of the stacking sequence at the co film may modify the diffusion barriers significantly .",
    "regarding subsurface sites , the barrier for the diffusion of h into the co film decreases as the h coverage increases , but it is always large enough to support the low probability of the penetration of h into the film , in good agreement with the experiments of thermal desorption through formation of h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that the adsorption of h is governed by the local surface formation of strong h - co bonds .",
    "supporting this , for all structures considered the h - co distance remains around 1.7  , independent of the h coverage and the co film structure .",
    "the largest variations of the h - co distance are found to depend on the h adsorption site , where h is coordinated to a different number of co atoms : from 1.5   for the on - top surface adsorption ( coordination 1 ) , to 1.9 for hollow subsurface sites ( coordination 6 ) .",
    ".energy ( in mev ) per h atom with respect to the most stable fcc hollow site for different h adsorption sites on 2 ml co on ru(0001 ) , both for 1 ml and 0.25 ml h coverage .",
    "the dependence on the in - plane lattice parameter a@xmath9 and the stacking sequence of the co film are shown for the high h coverage . [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ mom ]    finally , we discuss the h induced effects for thicker co films . to this end , we performed skkr calculations for co films of up to 6 mls covered by 1 ml of h. figures [ fmoms ] and [ fmoml ] show respectively the layer resolved values of the spin ( m@xmath10 ) and orbital ( m@xmath11 ) contributions to the magnetic moment for the different co thicknesses , together with those at the corresponding bare surfaces . upon h adsorption",
    "there is always a strong reduction of both m@xmath10 and m@xmath11 at the surface co atoms . on average ,",
    "the reduction is around 0.25 @xmath12 for m@xmath10 and 0.04 @xmath12 for m@xmath11 .",
    "by contrast , at the subsurface co layer the reduction of the magnetic moment is low , becoming negligible for the layers underneath .",
    "although the specific values of m@xmath10 and m@xmath11 at each layer involve in a complex way the oscillatory layerwise variation of the electronic properties , the effect of h does not depend on the co thickness .",
    "furthermore , it is very similar for both components of the magnetic moment .    not shown in the figure , in all cases",
    "the h atom acquires a m@xmath10 of 0.01 @xmath12 , and no orbital polarization .",
    "similarly , the components of the moment induced at the interface ru atom are around -0.02 @xmath12 ( m@xmath10 ) and -0.001 @xmath12 ( m@xmath11 ) for all co thicknesses , without any significant variation as compared to the bare film .",
    "the layer resolved dos ( not shown here ) are consistent with this conclusion , with h induced features almost restricted to the surface co layer in each case .",
    "thus we can conclude that the h induced effects are essentially restricted to the surface and independent of the co thickness .",
    "( color online ) layer - resolved co spin magnetic moment for co films of 2 to 6 mls ( from top to bottom ) , either bare ( empty circles ) or covered by h ( solid circles ) .",
    "layers are numbered from the ru interface . ]",
    "( color online ) same as figure [ fmoms ] for the orbital contributions to the magnetic moment . ]",
    "in terms of _ ab initio _ calculations , we performed a detailed theoretical analysis of the stability , electronic structure and magnetism of co / ru(0001 ) films upon h adsorption .",
    "our main observations are as follows : h adsorbs on co at the hollow sites by preserving the threefold symmetry of the system .",
    "the adsorption is endothermic for all h coverages , with the largest binding energy corresponding to the complete h overlayer .",
    "furthermore , the probability of h desorption or segregation is low .",
    "concerning the structural , electronic and magnetic properties , the effect of h has a local surface character and is almost independent of the detailed co thickness and structure .",
    "h always attenuates surface effects .",
    "however , for partial h coverages , this leads to the enhancement of the surface induced features for co atoms not bonded to h , and in particular to an enhancement of the net surface magnetic moment .",
    "our results point to the importance of residual h in magnetic measurements , and to the possibility for the reversible manipulation of the properties of ultrathin co films and surfaces by tuning h adsorption .",
