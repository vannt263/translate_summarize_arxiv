    "in this section , we consider a setting where the worker , instead of maximizing her expected payment , aims to maximize the expected value of some _ utility function _ of her payment .",
    "consider any function @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that instead of aiming to maximize the expected payment , the worker has some _ utility _",
    "@xmath1 for any payment made to her , and that she aims to maximize the expected utility . in other words , for any payment @xmath2 made to the worker ( based on the evaluation of her answers to the gold standard questions ) , her utility for this payment is @xmath3 .",
    "the worker aims to maximize the expected value of @xmath3",
    ".    we will require the function @xmath1 to be strictly increasing and invertible .",
    "the results presented so far in the paper implicitly assumed that the utility is simply the identity function , namely @xmath4 .",
    "the function @xmath1 is assumed to be public knowledge .",
    "given the evaluations @xmath5 of the worker s responses to the @xmath6 gold standard questions , consider the following payment mechanism : @xmath7    it is easy to see that the properties of mechanism  [ algo : incentive_minbelief ] carry over to this mechanism in the case of a general utility function @xmath1 .",
    "this feature is formalized in the following proposition .",
    "[ thm : utility ] for a worker who aims to maximize function @xmath1 of the payment , the mechanism in equation   is incentive compatible , frugal , and is the one and only incentive compatible mechanism to satisfy the no - free - lunch axiom .",
    "in earlier sections , we made the coarse belief assumption of the existence of some @xmath8 such that the belief of a worker for any option is assumed to either equal @xmath9 or more than @xmath10 .",
    "we then designed a mechanism to elicit the support of the worker s belief under this assumption .",
    "a natural question that arises is that instead of making a coarse belief assumption , can we fix a parameter , say , @xmath11 , and incentivize the worker to select all options for which her belief is strictly greater @xmath12 ?",
    "although not the primary focus of this paper , we devote the present section to investigating this complimentary setting out of intellectual curiosity as well as practical relevance . as we show below , the answer to this question is both yes and no .      for a given value of @xmath11 , we will call a mechanism as incentive compatible if the expected payment of any worker is strictly maximized when the worker selects all options for which her belief is strictly greater than @xmath12 .",
    "we retain most notation form section  [ sec : problem ] , with a few exceptions as follows .",
    "we continue to let @xmath13 denote the payment function ; @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "observe that unlike the setting considered earlier in section  [ sec : problem ] , here we have included @xmath9 in the domain of the payment function .",
    "this is because under the present setting , when @xmath15 , there is a possibility that the worker has a belief no more than @xmath12 for each option , for instance , if the worker is totally clueless .",
    "let us define two integers @xmath16 and @xmath17 as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "is the indicator function , with @xmath20 if @xmath21 is true , and @xmath9 otherwise . ] observe that if if @xmath22 then it is meaningless to let the worker select zero options since the belief for at least one option must be @xmath23 or higher .",
    "also observe that for any value of @xmath11 , it is meaningless to allow the worker to select @xmath24 or more options , since it is mathematically impossible for those many options to have beliefs more than @xmath12 . as a result , we will require the worker to select at least @xmath16 and at most @xmath17 options for any question .",
    "the goal remains to design the payment function @xmath25 when @xmath26 for every @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "if the worker s responses do not satisfy this condition , then we assume the convention of setting the payment to a small enough value ( say , @xmath28 or some further penalty ) .",
    "we do _ not _ assume the restriction of coarseness of the beliefs .",
    "we stick to the identity utility function , while noting that extension to other utility functions is straightforward following section  [ sec : utility ] .",
    "finally , we note some special cases which we exclude from the subsequent analysis .",
    "the case of @xmath29 degenerates to the impossibility result of theorem  [ thm : support_impossible ] proved earlier .",
    "the cases of @xmath30 _ or _",
    "@xmath31 degenerate to the `` skip - based '' single - selection setting studied in  shah2015double .",
    "hence we focus on the case of @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the rest of this section .      * * input : * evaluations of the worker s answers to the @xmath6 gold standard questions @xmath34 * * output : * define a function @xmath35 as @xmath36 the worker s payment is @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    given the conventions described in the previous subsection for the payment function , it remains to construct the payment function under `` normal '' conditions , that is , when @xmath40 for every @xmath27 $ ] .",

    "the setting also permits a `` multiplicative '' mechanism , consistent with the earlier results in this paper .",
    "[ cor : multiplicative_everyoption ] under the assumption that no belief equals exactly @xmath12 , the mechanism @xmath47 for some constants @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , is also incentive compatible .      in this section ,",
    "we show that the core structure of mechanism  [ algo : incentive_every ] , namely the function @xmath43 , is essential for any mechanism .",

    ", we conjecture that the multiplicative version of the mechanism ( corollary  [ cor : multiplicative_everyoption ] ) may possess attractive properties .",

    "we take an approval - voting based means of gathering labeled data from crowdsourcing .",
    "we design an incentive mechanism via a principled theoretical approach , and prove appealing properties of optimality and uniqueness of our proposed mechanism .",
    "preliminary experiments conducted on amazon mechanical turk corroborate the usefulness of this mechanism for practical scenarios .",
    "our mechanism may also draw more experts to the crowdsourcing platform since their compensation will be significantly higher than that of mediocre workers , unlike most compensation mechanisms in current use .",
    "we conclude with a discussion on closely related topics that merit investigation in the future .",
    "* aggregation of labels . * for the traditional single - selection setting , there is a long , existing line of work on statistical methods to aggregate redundant noisy data from multiple workers  dawid1979maximum , whitehill2009whose , raykar2010learning , karger2011iterative , liu2012variational , zhou2012learning .",
    "an open problem is the design of aggregation algorithms for approval - voting - based data : algorithms that can exploit the specific structure of the responses that arise as a result of the approval voting interface and the proposed mechanism",

    "choosing the right interface .",
    "* there are tradeoffs between various interfaces for crowdsourcing .",
    "for instance , the approval voting interface elicits the support of the belief whereas the single selection interface elicits the mode .",
    "choosing among these two interfaces would depend on the application under consideration , and moreover , one may adaptively switch between the two depending on the data obtained .",
    "a natural question that one may further ask is , why not elicit the entire belief distribution itself ? while the entire belief distribution seems to supercede the support and the mode , stating the distribution will also require much more time and effort from the workers , and often also suffer from a higher noise .",
    "these tradeoffs must be taken into account when choosing the interface for the application at hand .    *",
    "the coarse beliefs parameter .",
    "* one may wish to evaluate the value of @xmath10 by explicitly asking workers on the crowdsourcing platform for this value .",
    "however , it is noted in the literature ( e.g. , see  shah2015topology for experiments on amazon mechanical turk ) that the cardinal representations that humans provide are not always consistent with their respective mental beliefs , and are far noisier .",
    "this phenomenon suggests the requirement of developing alternative methods of evaluating this parameter .",
    "indeed , measurement is considered one of the most difficult parts of behavioral research .",
