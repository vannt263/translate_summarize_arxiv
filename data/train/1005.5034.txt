    "our experimental value of @xmath150 , one of the most accurate values for this parameter in a nuclear decay ever obtained , is in agreement with the recoil corrected standard - model value of @xmath7 .",

    "limits on right - handed currents were obtained as well , although these are somewhat less stringent than the ones from previous experiments .",
    "finally , the shell - model calculation of the induced form factors showed that for an allowed but hindered transition , such as the @xmath0  decay of @xmath2co , it is not the common weak - magnetism , @xmath18 , and induced tensor , @xmath137 , form factors that determine the size of the recoil corrections on @xmath1 , but rather the e2-type form factors @xmath110 and @xmath142 .",
