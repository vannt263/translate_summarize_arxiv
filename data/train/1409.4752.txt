    "in current communication systems , there is usually an architectural separation between error correction and data encryption .",
    "the former is typically realized at the physical layer transforming the noisy communication channel into a reliable `` bit pipe . ''",
    "the data encryption is implemented on top of that by applying cryptographic principles .    in recent years , _ information theoretic approaches to security _ have been intensively examined as a complement to such cryptographic techniques .",
    "such approaches establish reliable communication and data confidentiality jointly at the physical layer by taking the properties of the noisy channel into account .",
    "this line of study was initiated by wyner , who introduced the wiretap channel in @xcite , and subsequently generalized by csiszr and krner to the broadcast channel with confidential messages @xcite .",
    "recently , this area of research has drawn considerable attention since it provides a promising approach to achieve security and to embed secure communication into wireless networks ; see for example @xcite and references therein . not surprisingly , it therefore has also been identified by operators and national agencies as a key technique to secure future communication systems @xcite .",
    "these studies are in particular crucial for wireless communication systems , since they are inherently vulnerable to eavesdropping due to the open nature of the wireless medium .",
    "indeed , transmitted signals are received by intended users but are also easily eavesdropped upon by non - legitimate receivers .",
    "many of the previous studies have in common that all channels ( including those to the eavesdropper ) are assumed to be perfectly known to all users and fixed during the entire duration of transmission .",
    "however , in practical systems channel state information ( csi ) will always be limited due to the nature of the wireless channel and estimation / feedback inaccuracy .",
    "furthermore , malevolent eavesdroppers will not provide any information about their channels to legitimate users to make eavesdropping even harder .",
    "accordingly , limited csi ( especially for the eavesdropper channel ) must be assumed to ensure reliability and data confidentiality .",
    "a first step in the direction of more realistic csi assumptions is given by the concept of a _ compound channel _ @xcite .",
    "here it is assumed that the actual channel realization is unknown .",
    "rather , it is only known to the legitimate users that the true realization belongs to a known set of channels ( uncertainty set ) and that it remains constant during the entire duration of transmission .",
    "accordingly , secure communication over compound channels is of great importance .",
    "the _ compound wiretap channel _ has been studied in @xcite and the compound broadcast channel with confidential messages in @xcite . despite these efforts ,",
    "a general single - letter characterization of the secrecy capacity remains unknown until now ( if it exists at all ) .",
    "such a description is only known for special cases such as degraded channels @xcite or certain mimo gaussian channels @xcite .",
    "for the general case , only a multi - letter description of the secrecy capacity has been established so far @xcite .",
    "the quality of csi is further weakened by the concept of _ arbitrarily varying channels ( avcs ) _ @xcite .",
    "in addition to the assumption that the actual channel realization is known only to be from a known uncertainty set , it is further assumed that this realization may vary from channel use to channel use in an arbitrary and unknown manner ( in contrast to compound channels in which it remains constant ) .",
    "the corresponding _ arbitrarily varying wiretap channel ( avwc ) _ has been studied in @xcite and it has been shown that it makes a difference in this case whether unassisted or common randomness ( cr ) assisted codes are used .",
    "in particular , the deterministic secrecy capacity may be zero ( if the channel possesses the so - called property of symmetrizability as precisely defined later ) , while the cr - assisted secrecy capacity is non - zero . in @xcite a complete characterization of the relation between the deterministic and cr - assisted secrecy capacity",
    "is established ; however , a single - letter characterization of the cr - assisted secrecy capacity itself remains open and only a multi - letter description has been established @xcite .",
    "a gaussian mimo wiretap channel where the noiseless eavesdropper channel is arbitrarily varying is considered in @xcite .",
    "an achievable secrecy rate is derived and the secrecy degrees of freedom are established , while its capacity remains unknown .",
    "these concepts of compound and arbitrarily varying channels do not only capture the case of channel uncertainty , but are also suitable to model scenarios with active adversaries .",
    "for example , such an adversary may be able to maliciously influence the channel conditions by controlling which channel realization governs the transmission . since legitimate transmitter and receiver have usually no knowledge about the strategy or the intention of the adversary",
    ", they have to choose their encoding - decoding functions in such a way that they work for all possible channel realizations simultaneously .",
    "thus , such attacks can be perfectly modeled by compound channels .",
    "it becomes even worse for more powerful adversaries , which may be able to jam the legitimate transmission .",
    "again , having no knowledge about the particular jamming strategy , the legitimate users have to be prepared for a channel that may vary in an unknown and arbitrary manner from channel use to channel use .",
    "this is the avwc , which has been analyzed in @xcite in this context . in particular , the optimal jamming strategy of the adversary",
    "has been identified and it is shown that it differs whether the adversary has access to the common randomness or not .",
    "an eavesdropper who can control its channel state in a gaussian two - way wiretap setup is studied in @xcite .",
    "achievable secrecy rates are derived based on cooperative jamming .",
    "the analysis in this paper is driven by the following observation : obviously , the secrecy capacities of the compound wiretap channel and the avwc depend on the underlying uncertainty set . now in general , the performance of a communication system ( in our case the secrecy capacity ) should depend in a _ continuous _ way on the system parameters ( in particular the uncertainty set ) .",
    "since , if small changes in the parameters would lead to dramatic losses in performance , the approach at hand will most likely not be used .",
    "indeed , one is interested in approaches that are robust against such variations in the sense that small variations in the uncertainty set result in small variations in the secrecy capacity .",
    "such a continuous dependency is in particular desirable in the context of active adversaries who can influence the system parameters in a malicious way .",
    "surprisingly , the question of continuity of capacities for classical communication scenarios is rarely discussed . however , for the quantum case , there has been some work .",
    "continuity capacities has been studied in @xcite for quantum channels and in @xcite for arbitrarily varying quantum channels .    in section",
    "[ sec : cc ] we introduce the compound wiretap channel and a distance concept to measure how `` close '' two compound wiretap channels are .",
    "then in section [ sec : cc_continuity ] , we show that the corresponding secrecy capacity is a continuous function of the uncertainty set . thus , for compound channels , small variations in the uncertainty set result only in small variations of the secrecy capacity . interpreting the uncertainty set as the strategy space of an adversary , this shows that secure communication over compound channels is robust against changes in the adversary s strategies .    in section",
    "[ sec : avc ] we introduce the avwc and study its secrecy capacity in section [ sec : avc_continuity ] . while the secrecy capacity of the compound wiretap channel is continuous in the uncertainty set , we see that the unassisted secrecy capacity of the avwc can be discontinuous in the uncertainty set .",
    "the practical relevance of this observation is that such unassisted schemes might not be robust in the sense that small variations can lead to dramatic losses in secrecy capacity .",
    "in particular in the context of active adversaries this means that small changes in the adversary s strategy can lead to completely different behavior of the system . in section [ sec : robust ] we analyze the behavior of codes that achieve weak secrecy and show that such codes are robust in the information leakage .",
    "this means that a code that realizes weak secrecy for a certain eavesdropper avc is also good for all such avcs in a certain neighborhood .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
