    "shock waves are used extensively to study matter at conditions of extreme pressure and temperature , and have been used to obtain some of the highest laboratory - attained pressures .",

    "these methods must use more modest system sizes , of hundreds or thousands of atoms in the case of dft .",
    "silicon has a rich phase diagram , with metallic dense phases rather different in character to the ambient diamond phase , making it an interesting and challenging object of simulation . in total , eleven stable or metastable phases of silicon are currently known.@xcite shock experiments have provided important data for constructing the phase diagram .",
    "the phase transition in silicon from the cubic diamond structure to the beta - tin structure , occurring at at room temperature , and undergoing a reduction in volume of 20% , has been well established by static loading experiments from the 1960s onward.@xcite evidence of at least one phase transition at similar pressures was then observed in shock - wave experiments , starting with ( .",
    "* )    if a shock wave is strong enough to cause a material to yield plastically or undergo a phase transition , the wave can split into two or more separate shock waves , and this has long been observed and understood.@xcite in this situation , the last shock takes the material to its final state , but the preceding shocks take the material to a cusp on the pressure - volume hugoniot locus caused by a transition : either the hugoniot elastic limit or the onset pressure of a phase transition . in silicon , @xcite found a three - wave structure for samples shocked in the @xmath0 crystal direction and a four - wave structure when shocked in the @xmath1 or @xmath2 directions . in the latter cases ,",
    "these waves were attributed to : an initial elastic precursor to the hugoniot elastic limit of , followed by waves corresponding to a state of plastic yield and two successive phase transitions at and . along @xmath0 , the higher elastic limit of obscures the first transition wave , and",
    "a single wave takes the material simultaneously to a new phase and to a state of hydrostatic stress .",
    "the work of @xcite largely confirmed the findings of ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although they observed a three - wave structure , regardless of crystal orientation , consistent with only a single phase transition at . above the hugoniot elastic",
    "limit , shock compression was found to result in a hydrostatic stress configuration , due to the complete loss of strength in the material .",
    "more recently , and contrary to the earlier experimental work , @xcite reported a single phase transition that is complete by .",
    "shocks to these pressures show a much greater volume compression than the points attributed to an extended mixed - phase region by both @xcite and @xcite here the phase transition is not complete until at least .",
    "this discrepancy is explained by @xcite as arising from the reflection of the first two shock waves propagating back into the material before the arrival of the third wave , and altering the peak state of the earlier experiments .",
    "they avoid this eventuality by backing the silicon with a window made from lithium fluoride , a material with a good impedance match to silicon .",
    "the _ imma _ phase of silicon is found intermediate between the beta - tin and simple hexagonal phases , and is stable between and at room temperature.@xcite theoretically , the energy and volume of these three phases are close.@xcite a recent simulation of directly shocked silicon using an empirical potential@xcite found a phase transition to an _ imma _ phase with a modification of the tersoff potential@xcite of ( . * ? ? ?",
    "* )    in this paper , we give the hugoniot loci according to density functional theory for several pure phases of silicon , including cubic diamond under elastic compression along @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , a hydrostat ( resulting from either a single shock or a split - shock structure ) , beta - tin , simple hexagonal and the liquid , and report shock temperatures for these states .",
    "several approaches can been taken for the determination of a hugoniot locus from molecular dynamics .",
    "the most straightforward , but computationally the most demanding , is to simulate a slab of atoms struck by an impactor directly , measuring the speed of any shock waves and post - shock average particle velocities as they arise from the simulation . from the hugoniot relations ,",
    "these velocities can be converted to a relationship between pressure and volume compression . for empirical potentials ,",
    "a local stress is conveniently available , so this could also be taken directly from the simulation .",
    "this is the approach taken by , e.g. @xcite    it is simple to check that a given equilibrium state lies on or close to the ( single - shock ) hugoniot locus , which amounts to satisfying the hugoniot relation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the internal energy , @xmath5 is the specific volume and @xmath6 is the stress in the direction of the shock ( and can be replaced with the pressure @xmath7 in a hydrostatic situation ) .",
    "the zero - subscripted variables are for the pre - shocked state .",
    "other ( equivalent ) hugoniot relations exist between any three of : internal energy , pressure , volume , shock velocity and particle velocity .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to sample several points that are chosen to bracket the hugoniot locus , and the hugoniot state then approximated by interpolation , or solved for iteratively .",
    "the former is the approach taken by @xcite for shocked deuterium .",
    "@xcite constructed a polymorphic equation of state for silicon , incorporating dftsimulations of the cubic diamond and @xmath8-sn phases , with the lattice - thermal contribution approximated by quasiharmonic phonons .",
    "the equation of state was constructed with a particular focus on simulating shock waves .",
    "the full equation of state was sampled and the hugoniot locus could therefore be extracted as a one - dimensional path through it . the phase boundary and mixed phase region along the hugoniot were found explicitly by minimizing the helmholtz free energy computed from the quasiharmonic phonon approximation .    alternatively , a hugoniot state can be determined dynamically from within a single molecular dynamics simulation by some modified dynamics to constrain the state to satisfy [ eq : ehug ] .",
    "this is the approach taken by the hugoniostat methods@xcite and the technique of @xcite the former simulations use modified nos ",
    "hoover dynamics while the latter uses coupled dynamics of the atoms and simulation cell , whose lagrangian involves the computed instantaneous shock speed , and varies the simulation cell uniaxially .",
    "one aim of these dynamics is to work on timescales comparable to shock - passage times , without the overhead of dealing with a direct non - equilibrium simulation .",
    "if we are interested only in the final post - shock state , and are not interested in the ( modified ) dynamics while the constraint is being applied , we are free to use a method based on simple velocity rescaling , analogous to the procedure of berendsen,@xcite which is what we propose here due to its increased efficiency in reaching the final state .",
    "the ab initio mdsimulations described here were performed with the siestamethod and implementation of density functional theory , @xcite using the @xcite gga functional .",
    ".basis parameters for silicon , according to the soft - confinement scheme of @xcite . for the purposes of basis generation ,",
    "an effective ionic charge of -0.46 was used , which was also variationally optimized .",
    "the cutoff radii of the first and second zeta functions are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the confinement potential s internal radius .",
    "@xmath12 is the soft - confinement prefactor . [",
    "cols=\">,>,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we consider here two possible phase transitions starting from silicon in the cubic diamond structure : to a liquid , and to the beta - tin structure .",
    "in addition , we assume that the onset of either transition occurs at , close to the observed experimental value .",
    "the phase lines are experimental values , obtained by @xcite this gives the two dashed lines appearing in [ fig : hug - siesta - expt - si - pv ] .",
    "the lower , green dashed line for diamond structure to beta - tin is nearly at constant pressure , since its slope is dominated by the steep phase - line of the transition,@xcite @xmath13 .",
    "this is consistent with the experiment of ( .",
    "* ) the upper , blue dashed line for melting the diamond structure is influenced most strongly by the compressibility @xmath8 of the cubic diamond phase at the pressure and temperature of the onset .",
    "representative literature values for the constants appearing in the above expression for the liquid are summarized in [ tab : phase - constants ] .",
    "this line underestimates the experimentally observed slope seen by @xcite and @xcite while the simulated temperature at this pressure is much too low for melting , the simulations of the ` plastically - yielded ' state do not include dissipative heating and this could cause a considerable temperature rise above those reported in [ fig : shock - temperature ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have described a simple annealing method and shown that it may be used to obtain a state on the hugoniot locus of a pure phase of a material with several condensed phases efficiently , from first - principles .",
    "an approximation relying on the slope of the phase boundary can be used to obtain the part of the hugoniot corresponding to coexistence between two phases .    in the case of silicon ,",
    "the results computed using this procedure with the forces described using density functional theory match existing experimental data very well for pressures up to , the limit of available experimental data .",
    "we have provided a prediction of the shock temperatures of silicon over this pressure range .",
    "this study supports the conclusions of the experimental work in general , that silicon after yield supports no deviatoric stress , and of ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the first observed phase transition along the shock locus is likely to be to simple hexagonal .",
