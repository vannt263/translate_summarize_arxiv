    "majorana fermions ( mfs ) have been the subject of intense recent study in part due to their potential application in topological quantum computation ( tqc).@xcite unlike ordinary fermionic or bosonic operators for which the particle creation operators are the hermitian conjugate of the annihilation operators , mf operators , @xmath1 , are self - adjoint ( @xmath2 ) . in this sense , mfs",
    "are their own anti - particle and the realization of such excitations would be the first example of such particles which had been proposed more than seventy - five years ago.@xcite mfs are of interest for tqc because despite having no internal degrees of freedom individually , a pair of mfs , say @xmath3 and @xmath4 , have two distinct possible states ( fusion channels ) .",
    "these states , which may be thought of as the two possible occupation states of the complex fermionic operator @xmath5 , are energetically degenerate to a degree exponential in the separation of the majorana fermions , and correspond to the eigenstates of the combined operator @xmath6 , with eigenvalues @xmath7 .",
    "such a topological protected degeneracy has yet to be seen in nature , and the observation of such would be a major break - through in physics .",
    "the central idea of tqc is to use the topologically degenerate states of a pair of mfs as a 2-level topological qubit which would in principle be protected from decoherence .",
    "the manipulation of the information contained in the topological qubits requires the use of topological braid operations which consists of moving the mfs around one another .    in the past few years ,",
    "topological superconductors have become promising candidates for realizing mfs .",
    "@xcite recently , it has been proposed that a semiconductor thin film with rashba - type spin - orbit ( so ) coupling together with proximity - induced superconductivity and zeeman splitting would be a suitable platform for realizing a majorana - fermion - carrying topological superconducting ( ts ) state .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0-wave superconducting pairing potential can be induced in the semiconductor system by placing it in proximity to a conventional superconductor such as aluminum .",
    "the zeeman splitting can similarly be induced , in principle , by proximity to a magnetic - insulator .",
    "@xcite the one - dimensional version of this system , i.e. a semiconducting nanowire with proximity - induced @xmath0-wave superconductivity , has also been shown to host mf as zero - energy modes at the ends of the wire under appropriate conditions . @xcite the one - dimensional nanowire geometry has the specific advantage that the zeeman splitting @xmath8 in the nanowire is not required to be proximity - induced from a magnetic insulator , but instead can be introduced by a magnetic field parallel to the nanowire .",
    "@xcite such a parallel magnetic field would not introduce unwanted orbital effects such as vortices if a thin - film superconductor is used to generate the superconducting proximity - effect .",
    "the proposed semiconducting structures exist in a ts phase and supports mfs at its ends when the @xmath0-wave superconducting pair potential @xmath9 , zeeman splitting @xmath8 , and the chemical potential @xmath10 satisfy the condition @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite thus the chemical potential @xmath10 , which can be controlled by an external gate potential , can be used to tune a nanowire from the ts phase to a non - topological ( nts ) phase .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0-wave proximity effect on a inas quantum wire , which also has a sizable so coupling , may have already been demonstrated in experiments . @xcite these semiconductor based proposals for realizing a tqc platform can take advantage of the considerably advanced semiconductor fabrication technology .",
    "therefore , it seems that a majorana - carrying ts state in a semiconductor quantum wire may be within experimental reach .",
    "until recently , motivated by experiments , most discussions of observing non - abelian statistics using mfs has been restricted to 2d systems . in 2d non - abelian systems ,",
    "the quantum information associated with mfs can be manipulated in a topologically protected manner by exchanging the majorana bound states ( e.g. , by adiabatically moving vortices in _ p+ip _",
    "superconductors).@xcite the protection of the topological degeneracy associated with mfs requires the mfs to remain spatially separated at all steps of the exchange .",
    "therefore , at first glance , it appears that it is impossible to exchange the mfs at the ends of a 1d wire , since any such attempt would necessarily lead to the spatial overlap of mfs at some stage of the overlap process .",
    "a solution to this problem has been provided by by alicea _",
    "@xcite , who have shown that connecting up a system of nanowires into a network allows one to exchange mfs . in their proposal , the two mfs , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , at the ends of a wire can be exchanged by introducing an additional nanowire @xmath12 .",
    "the additional nanowire , @xmath12 , allows one to temporarily move one of the mfs , say @xmath3 , away from the original nanowire , @xmath13 , so that the other mf @xmath4 can be moved across the wire @xmath13 without colliding with @xmath4 .",
    "the mf @xmath3 can then be returned from the wire @xmath12 back to it s original wire @xmath13 .",
    "while this scheme solves the basic problem of non - abelian statistics in @xmath14d , it requires the transport of a mf across a tri - junction between two topological nanowires @xmath13 and @xmath12 , which is potentially a more complex topological object than the simple topological nanowire .",
    "the continuous transport of mfs through such a tri - junction is potentially dependent on details of the junction that may be difficult to control.@xcite moreover , from a theoretical point of view , the explicit determination of the non - abelian statistics in this geometry in terms of the microscopics of the junction is somewhat complicated .",
    "in this paper we propose an alternative scheme to transport mfs at the ends of one dimensional semiconductor nanowires where the ends of the nanowires remain fixed , but the tunneling amplitudes between the end mfs are varied .",
    "bringing the end mfs closer together allows one to create a non - vanishing hamiltonian of the mfs which can generate effecting mf hopping from one end site to another . using this picture of a dynamically changing tunneling hamiltonian , we will be able to derive a simple explicit expression for the non - abelian statistics transformation of the mfs in terms of tunneling matrix elements .",
    "as mentioned in the previous paragraph , mfs are strictly zero - energy modes with an associated topological degeneracy only in the limit when they are separated by a distance that is large compared to the decay length of the mfs .",
    "the two states of the mfs @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be described in terms of the 2 possible occupation states of the dirac fermion @xmath15 .",
    "these 2 states correspond to the eigenvalues @xmath16 and @xmath14 of the number operator @xmath17 . in general ,",
    "the hamiltonian for a pair of mfs with a non - negligible splitting produces a splitting between the 2 energy states and can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the tunneling matrix element for the mfs which depends on the separation @xmath20 between the mfs @xmath3 and @xmath4.@xcite the energy splitting between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 states is given by @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the topological degeneracy of mfs emerges only in the limit @xmath24 when the mf overlap matrix - element @xmath19 vanishes because of the localization of the mf wave - functions . here",
    "@xmath25 is the localization length of the mfs .",
    "the tunneling of mfs at the ends of different wires , whose ends are placed close together , is entirely analogous to the tunneling of electrons between two quantum dots which can be controlled by raising and lowering the barrier between the dots .",
    "similarly , tunneling amplitudes between mfs on different semiconductor nanowires can be controlled simply by adding a gate controllable tunnel barrier between the mfs .",
    "@xcite gate voltages can also induce tunneling between mfs at the ends of the same ts segment by tuning the nanowire close to a ts - nts phase transition .",
    "@xcite bringing the nanowire close to the ts - nts transition , decreases the gap of the system which in turn increases the localization length @xmath25 of mfs in the wire and allows the tunneling between the initially localized mfs at the ends of ts segments .",
    "the quantitative details of how the tunneling is controlled in topological nanowires is discussed in the appendix .",
    "tunneling of ordinary fermions such as electrons can be used to move electrons from one quantum dot to another in a system of quantum dots . in this paper , we will show that the same principle applies to mfs , and repeated use of the tunneling hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ tunneling ] can be used to exchange mfs @xmath3 and @xmath4 in a system of ts nanowires that hosts such mfs at its ends . the unitary time - evolution operator @xmath26 associated with the exchange maps @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 can be directly computed from the tunneling matrix elements @xmath30 involved in moving the mf @xmath3 to the starting position of the mf @xmath4 . in the low - energy subspace of mfs , the time - evolution operation @xmath26 , that describes the exchange process has the usual form of a braid matrix @xcite @xmath31 while there are only two possible answers @xmath32 for the braid - matrix , it is critical to be able to determine the factor @xmath29 for a given braid since this is what distinguishes clock - wise from counter - clock - wise exchanges . for the specific geometry discussed in the appendix with wires placed in a superconducting film together with an in - plane magnetic field at @xmath33 degrees to the wires ,",
    "the sign of the braid matrix , @xmath29 , is determined by the sign of the rashba spin - orbit coupling constant @xmath34 .",
    "the braiding scheme we will discuss is potentially related to measurement - only schemes for braiding of topological quasiparticles .",
    "@xcite however , it is not clear how the anyon model postulates assumed in the measurement - only theory apply to the superconducting nanowire systems described by mean - field bcs theory .",
    "for example , the identification of the tunneling matrix element between mfs in eq .",
    "[ tunneling ] with the topological charge measurement in ref . becomes subtle in cases where the sign of the tunneling @xmath19 oscillates in sign with the separation @xmath20 . on the other hand",
    "the approach in this paper is based only on the mf tunneling hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ tunneling ] , which can be derived microscopically from bcs hamiltonians .",
    "@xcite the tunneling matrix elements @xmath35 themselves depend on the details of the nanowire system such as the spin - orbit coupling , the orientation of the wire and the zeeman splitting .",
    "therefore , we first consider exchange of mfs around a specific triangular loop geometry in terms of the tunnel matrix elements between the various mfs and then in the appendix , we show how the microscopic tunneling parameters may be calculated in one specific geometry . as a result of our calculation , we find that for general values of the tunneling , the parameter @xmath29 in the braid matrix @xmath26 has the simple form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the junction chirality of the triangular loop that we will define as the product of tunnelings around the loop . finally , we would like to note , that while the motivation of exchanging mfs is to be able to manipulate the information contained in topological qubits constructed from mfs in an effort to perform tqc , it is well - known that braiding by itself is insufficient for tqc .",
    "@xcite however , mf exchanges are still crucual as one of the most direct tests of non - abelian statistics and probably also for any future tqc schemes using mfs .",
    "to understand how mf transport in a system of nanowires can be induced by tunneling , consider the simple system of nanowires shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1a](a ) consisting of three semiconducting nanowire segments .",
    "two of these segments ( shown by solid blue lines in the schematic in fig .",
    "[ fig1a](b ) ) are in the ts phase , while the wire shown with the red dashed line is in the nts phase and serves as the tunnel barrier connecting mfs .",
    "each end of the wires in the ts phase supports a mf ( shown as discs ) . in the initial state ( shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1a](b ) ) , the gate voltage of the nts segment is chosen to allow a finite tunneling amplitude ( shown by light blue oval ) across it .",
    "this pairs up the mfs @xmath4 and @xmath38 into finite energy states with a gap . thus the operators @xmath39 become gapped mfs ( shown as dark blue discs ) and can not be used to store quantum information as can be done with the true zero - energy mfs ( shown as light orange discs ) .    the transfer of the mf from position @xmath14 to @xmath40 is achieved by adiabatically deactivating the tunneling in the nts segment @xmath41 and activating the tunneling in the ts segment @xmath42 .    the process of transferring the mf from position @xmath14 to @xmath40 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1a](b ) is described by the time - dependent tunneling hamiltonian that is derived by extending the tunneling hamiltonian in eq .",

    "it is convenient to understand the braiding procedure for mf operators in the heisenberg representation @xmath49 where the @xmath26 is the unitary time - evolution operator @xmath50 ( which is a time - ordered exponential ) .",

    "describing the evolution of @xmath51 can be written compactly in terms of an effective b - field @xmath53 as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the anti - symmetric levi - civita tensor . the time - dependent @xmath12-field given by @xmath56",
    "the heisenberg equation of motion for @xmath57 takes the form @xmath58 this equation of motion is identical to that of the spin operators @xmath59 of a spin-1/2 particle in a time - dependent magnetic field @xmath60 ( with a hamiltonian @xmath61 ) .",
    "furthermore , the initial condition on the operator @xmath62 corresponds to the spin - operator @xmath63 in an initial effective magnetic field @xmath64 that is aligned or anti - aligned with @xmath65 .",
    "thus , after a time - evolution under an adiabatically varying magnetic field , the spin ( and correspondingly the mf ) remains aligned or anti - aligned with the final magnetic field @xmath66 at time @xmath67 .",
    "this leads to the expression @xmath68 thus the transfer of the tunneling amplitude from the segment @xmath41 to the segment @xmath42 , leads to transport of the mf from position @xmath14 to position @xmath40 .",
    "the hopping of mfs between sites described by eq .",
    "[ eq : mfmotion ] is identical to the motion of regular fermionic operators under that action of tunneling .",
    "we will represent this process by the mf trajectory @xmath69 the result in eq .",
    "[ eq : mfmotion ] is consistent with a somewhat different approach suggested by kitaev .",
    "in the previous section , we saw that to transport a single mf from one position to another it was necessary to make use of another pair of mfs which were coupled by a weak tunneling so that they were not strictly zero - energy mfs .",
    "the single mf being exchanged had to be a true zero - energy mf with no tunneling , while the pair of mfs with tunneling between them may be thought of as a gapped mf dimer .",
    "exchanges of true zero - energy mfs requires a generalization of this picture to include several isolated mfs which are not coupled to any other mf by tunneling . as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig1a](b ) , such a process also requires a supply of gapped pairs of mfs ( i.e. mf dimers ) . in this paper",
    ", we will consider a system of nanowires with end mfs most of which are paired up by tunneling into mf dimers as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1b](a ) .",
    "if all mf sites are completely paired up , then the system has no true zero - energy mfs and no topological degeneracy or non - abelian statistics .",
    "therefore we consider a system , where in addition to the mf dimers , there are a few isolated mfs that are unpaired by tunneling . if one considers a regular lattice of nanowires so the the end mfs live on the vertices of a square lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] ) , a system of dimerized mfs forms a dimer covering of the lattice , while isolated mfs are associated with defects ( unpaired sites ) in the mf dimer lattice . as seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig1b](a ) and ( b ) , the transport of mfs on the dimer - lattice is obtained by changing the dimerization pattern on the dimer lattice analogous to fig .",
    "[ fig1a](b ) .",

    "we define effective topological wires , shown by green ( gray ) boxes in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] , by considering ts wire segments coupled by tunneling as a single topological wire .",
    "this identification , relates our proposal in a direct way to the proposal of alicea et al.@xcite however , the details of the physical implementation remain different and the dimer implementation presented in this paper will allow us to directly use eq .",

    "this requires that @xmath100 is composed of a pair exchange of the positions of mf dimers @xmath102 together with possible internal flips @xmath103 of the dimers .",
    "since , @xmath100 is an even permutation , and dimer exchanges are even permutations , the number of internally flipped dimers @xmath103 in @xmath100 is even .",
    "moreover , the unpaired pair of mfs @xmath104 is flipped in @xmath100 .",

    "this is purely imaginary and manifestly anti - symmetric as expected .",
    "furthermore since the fundamental spinor @xmath132 in terms of which each of @xmath154 are written is real , we can write it as @xmath155 , where the parameter @xmath156 depends on @xmath157 etc . with the help of these relations it is easy to tabulate the majorana tunneling matrix as an anti - symmetric matrix for the states in the order @xmath158 as      where the elements in the @xmath160 have been left empty since they are determined by the anti - symmetry constraint .",

    "the mfs only overlap in the limit where the gate potential is tuned so that the wire is driven towards a phase transition by tuning @xmath10 near to @xmath169 .",

    "thus , provided care is taken to ensure the conditions for the braid discussed in this section , the sign of both clock - wise exchanges is positive for positive rashba coupling @xmath34 and negative other - wise . for a given rasbha coupling the sign of the braid can be altered by considering anti - clockwise braids .",
