    "in this paper we continue the geometric construction of a sequence of flips associated to an embedded projective variety begun in @xcite . we give hypotheses under which this sequence of flips exists , and state some conjectures on how positive a line bundle on a curve must be to satisfy these hypotheses .",
    "these conjectures deal with the degrees of forms defining various secant varieties to curves and seem interesting outside of the context of the flip construction .    as motivation",
    ", we have the work of a. bertram and m. thaddeus . in @xcite this sequence of flips is constructed in the case of smooth curves via git , in the context of the moduli space of rank two vector bundles on a smooth curve .",
    "an understanding of this as a sequence of log flips is given in @xcite , and further examples of sequences of flips of this type , again constructed via git , are given in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "our construction , however , does not use the tools of geometric invariant theory and is closer in spirit to @xcite,@xcite .    in section  [ review ] , we review the constructions in @xcite and @xcite and describe the relevant results from @xcite . in section  [ genofsecants ]",
    "we discuss the generation of @xmath0 by cubics .",
    "in particular , we show ( theorem  [ settheo ] ) that large embeddings of varieties have secant varieties that are at least set theoretically defined by cubics .",
    "we also offer some general conjectures and suggestions in this direction for the generation of higher secant varieties .",
    "the construction of the new flips is somewhat more involved than that of the first in @xcite .",
    "we give a general construction of a sequence of birational transformations in section  [ genflipconst ] , and we describe in detail the second flip in section  [ secondflip ] .",
    "we mention that some of the consequences of these constructions and this point of view are worked out in @xcite .",

    "a different approach is taken in @xcite . there , for a fixed smooth curve @xmath1 of genus at least @xmath39 and a fixed line bundle @xmath26 , the moduli problem of semi - stable pairs @xmath40 consisting of a rank two bundle @xmath28 with @xmath29 , and a section @xmath41 , is considered .",
    "this , in turn , is interpreted as a git problem , and by varying the linearization of the group action , a collection of ( smooth ) moduli spaces @xmath42 ( @xmath12 as above ) is constructed . as stability is an open condition , these spaces are birational .",

    "on @xmath81 , the ample cone is bounded on one side by @xmath96 .",
    "this gives the map @xmath111 mentioned in theorem  [ flip ] ; in particular it is globally generated , the induced morphism is birational , and its exceptional locus is a projective bundle over @xmath73 . on the other side ,",
