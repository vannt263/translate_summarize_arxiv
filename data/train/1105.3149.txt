    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath19 , provides one of the strongest tests of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the formidable measurement from bnl @xcite and the theoretical prediction of @xmath20 is currently one of the few , if not the only sign for physics beyond the sm ( apart from neutrino masses ) . at present",
    ", the discrepancy stands at about three standard deviations , with comparable accuracy between experiment and theory .",
    "clearly , further progress is needed to scrutinize , and possibly firmly establish , this discrepancy . on the theoretical side",
    ", this will require first and foremost the improvement of the hadronic contributions which dominate the uncertainty of the sm prediction .",
    "the hadronic contributions are usually divided into the leading - order ( lo ) and higher - order ( ho ) vacuum polarisation ( vp ) contributions , and the so - called light - by - light scattering contributions , which are also subleading in terms of the power counting in the coupling @xmath21 : @xmath22 none of these contributions can be calculated reliably using perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , as virtual photons with low @xmath23 dominate the loop integrals . for the light - by - light contributions one relies on model - calculations .",
    "a brief discussion of the status of these will be given below when compiling our complete sm prediction of @xmath0 .",
    "fortunately , the situation is better under control for the vp contributions which are large compared to the light - by - light corrections ; they can be predicted via dispersion integrals and the experimentally measured hadronic cross section , @xmath24 .",
    "for @xmath25 the relation reads @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the undressed total hadronic cross section ( i.e. excluding vp corrections ) , and @xmath28 is a well known kernel function given , e.g. , by eq .",
    "( 45 ) in the first reference of @xcite .",
    "( note that the normalisation of @xmath28 used here differs by the factor @xmath29 . ) at present a precision of about 1% is required for the hadronic contributions .",
    "so it is mandatory to combine , in the most reliable and consistent way , the best available measurements from many experiments .",
    "recently , several new measurements have become available , both from ` direct scan ' experiments ( like cmd-2 and snd at novosibirsk s vepp , and bes at beijing s bepc ) , and also the radiative return data obtained in the recent analyses from kloe @xcite and babar @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to update our calculations @xcite of the hadronic vacuum polarisation ( hvp ) contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath30 . in section [ sec : vp ]",
    "we discuss recent changes in the hvp contributions to @xmath0 , detailing in subsection [ sec : vp2pi ] the progress due to radiative return analyses in the most important @xmath2 channel . in subsection",
    "[ sec : vpexcl ] we study improvements in the important energy region below @xmath3 gev . in section [ sec : gm2comp ] our updated complete sm prediction of @xmath0 is given and compared to the bnl measurement and other recent calculations of @xmath0 .",
    "our updated evaluation of @xmath30 is discussed in section [ sec : delal ] .",
    "section [ sec : sum ] contains our conclusions and outlook .",
    "since our last major update @xcite there have been significant additions to the data input for @xmath31 .",
    "most important , new precise data in the @xmath2 channel have become available , based on radiative return analyses from kloe @xcite and babar @xcite .",
    "these data constitute a crucial check of the previous measurements performed via the traditional method of energy scan by adjusting the @xmath32 beams , and their impact will be discussed in some detail below .",
    "also , many new data sets in subleading channels have been published , especially in the region just below @xmath3 gev where babar has measured many hadronic cross sections using radiative return . in the following",
    "we will concentrate on these two energy regions , before presenting our new results for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .      in the dispersion integral ( [ eq : disp ] ) , the kernel function @xmath28 has the form @xmath35 , where the term in brackets stands for a function which increases monotonically from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "this results in a strong weighting towards low energies and hence the dominance of the @xmath38 channel , which makes up more than 70% of @xmath39 . in recent years",
    "this channel has been measured very precisely via the direct scan method ( adjusting the @xmath32 beam energy ) by the cmd-2 and snd experiments at novosibirsk , see e.g. @xcite for a brief review of their results . from 2005",
    "onwards , analyses based on the method of radiative return have also become available .",
    "the first analysis of this kind for the @xmath2 channel was published by kloe @xcite , and their @xmath2 distribution agreed fairly well with the measurements from cmd-2 and snd , although there were some shape - differences compared to the cmd-2 and snd data .    in @xcite",
    "we had already taken into account these kloe data which were published in 2005 .",
    "however , the slight difference in shape had made it difficult to combine the kloe data with all the other @xmath2 data sets on a bin - to - bin basis , and we had hence combined the kloe data only _ after _ the dispersion integration , see the detailed discussion in @xcite .",
    "however , a combination of all data sets in one spectral function and on the same footing , i.e.   _ before integration _ , is clearly preferable , as possible inconsistencies between different data sets will lead to a well - defined error estimate in the data compilation and hence in @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , in the current analysis , we have included all data sets in the same way , by performing a @xmath40 fit similar to our original procedure , as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "this includes the new @xmath41 data from the radiative return analyses of kloe @xcite and babar @xcite .    for",
    "the data sets from babar and kloe full covariance matrices for statistical and systematic errors are available . to take these into account consistently",
    ", our original @xmath42 function has to be modified to include additional contributions from non - diagonal elements of the covariance matrices for the single data sets .",
    "the function now reads @xmath43 where the notation of @xcite has been adopted .",
    "the final term of the @xmath42 function ( [ eq : chisq ] ) allows the inclusion of the full covariance matrices as given for individual data sets ; here @xmath44 denotes the inverse of the matrix @xmath45 which is the sum of the statistical and systematic covariance matrices of the data set contributing to the specific term in the triple sum . in the first term of the @xmath42 function and therefore subtracted from the matrices @xmath45 . ]",
    "the subscript ` w / out cov . mat . ' in the penultimate term indicates that contributions taken into account via a full covariance matrix are excluded to avoid double counting .",
    "for example , babar gives experimental uncertainties in the form of a covariance matrix which contains `` non - diagonal statistical errors '' .",
    "in such cases , we take the statistical and systematic contributions to the @xmath42 function into account in the third term ( and the common systematic error in the first term ) , but do not include them in the second term . for those experiments",
    "whose experimental uncertainties can be considered as an overall systematic and ( diagonal ) statistical errors , we take them into account in the first and second term , but not in the third term . as in our previous works",
    ", this non - linear @xmath42 function is minimised numerically , returning the fitted ` cluster ' ( energy bin ) mean values @xmath46 and renormalisation factors @xmath47 , in addition to the full covariance matrix of the fit which is used for our error estimate in the prediction of @xmath39 and @xmath48 .",

    "while the agreement of the sum of all contributions is very good , there are differences in several channels , which are of the order of the errors , notably in the @xmath2 , @xmath52 and the @xmath53 channels .",
    "these differences presumably come from a different treatment of the data , like radiative corrections and the clustering and integration procedure , and reflect the different choices made by different groups .      of particular interest",
    "is the region of inclusive data above @xmath3 gev .",
    "although its influence for @xmath0 is suppressed by the kernel function @xmath28 of ( [ eq : disp ] ) , the new data lead to a significant shift downwards of the hadronic contributions to @xmath0 from this energy region .",

    "[ fig : sumrules ] as ( blue ) triangles , which are , as expected , lower than the respective results based on data alone .",

    "there is a discrepancy between the two alternatives , and , in the past , we had used a sum - rule analysis @xcite to distinguish between them . however , in the region below @xmath3 gev , many exclusive channels with higher multiplicities are now much better probed through the radiative return analyses of the babar data , and the sum of the exclusive channels is better determined .",
