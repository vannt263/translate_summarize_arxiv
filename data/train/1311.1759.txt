    "network theory has demonstrated to be an invaluable tool for studying complex system , i.e. systems composed of a large number of interacting elements . in particular , by analysing the spectral properties of the adjacency and laplacian matrix of a network is possible to gain insight on the structure and dynamics occurring on the network @xcite .",
    "however , most natural and engineered complex systems occur in interaction with other complex systems and hence are better described by a multilayer network @xcite .",
    "one can distinguish different types of multilayer networks depending on the interaction between the different systems ( layers ) .",
    "for example , a _",
    "multiplex network _ is composed by elements that interact trough different channels .",
    "each channel of interaction is represented by a layer , and the connections between different layers correspond to elements present in more than one layer simultaneously , so that in this case the intra - layer and inter - layer interactions represent indeed different kinds of relations .",
    "multilayer networks have attracted a lot of attention recently @xcite , and many different structural and dynamical features of multilayer networks have been studied @xcite , demonstrating that the behavior of interacting complex systems is very different from a simple combination of the isolated cases . in this work",
    "we argue that the mathematical concept of _ quotient graph _ ( see section [ section : networkquotients ] or @xcite ) underpins the notion of multilayer network and gives fundamental insights into the structure and properties of the network , in particular its spectral properties .    in the first part of this paper",
    ", we apply eigenvalue interlacing @xcite to the adjacency and laplacian eigenvalues of multilayer network quotients and subnetworks . for the interlacing to hold for laplacian eigenvalues",
    ", we define an appropriate notion of quotient laplacian , and relate its eigenvalues to a laplacian of the quotient graph . in the second part of the paper ,",
    "we describe implications of the spectral results to the structure and dynamical processes on a multilayer network .",
    "in particular , we show how the pattern of connections between layers constraints the dynamics on the whole system .",
    "our results agree with other methodologies such as perturbative analysis @xcite and put these and other results in a more rigorous framework .",
    "a network quotient can be seen as a coarsening , reduction or simplification of the original network . in this sense",
    "our spectral results quantify the information loss about the eigenvalue spectrum resulting from this reduction process , expressed as certain eigenvalue inequalities .",
    "we define two natural quotients for a multilayer network : the network of layers , which represents the connection pattern between layers ; and the aggregate network , which results from the projection of all layers onto an aggregated single - layer network ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we consider each layer as a separate ( sub)network .",
    "we then relate their adjacency and laplacian eigenvalues to those of the whole multilayer network , as an interlacing result in the most general case , and as a lifting result is there is enough regularity in the connectivity patterns .",
    "we also consider the layer subnetworks , as their eigenvalues are related to the multilayer eigenvalues in a similar fashion .",
    "see table [ table_summary ] for a brief summary of the analytical results .",
    "the quotient point of view that we present also suggests a very concrete notion of aggregate network among the ones proposed in the literature @xcite .    ) . the quotient ( c ) is only partially drawn , it is directed , and the edge thickness is proportional to the weight ( eq .  [ eqn : aggregate_weights ] ) .",
    "the network of layers ( b ) corresponds to the layer interconnection structure , while the aggregate network ( c ) represents the superposition of all the layers onto one . in this sense",
    ", they can be thought of as ` horizontal ' and ` vertical ' quotients , as the figure suggests .",
    "both quotients clearly represent a dimensionality reduction or coarsening of the original multilayer network . ]",
    "we give a self - contained description of network quotients and interlacing results ( deferring proofs to the appendix ) , including regular quotients , and subnetworks .",
    "all the material presented here is well - known @xcite , except , as far as we know , the definition of quotient laplacian ( eq .  [ eqn : quotientlaplacian ] ) and its relation to the laplacian of its quotient network .",
    "we represent an undirected network ( or _ graph _ ) @xmath0 on @xmath1 nodes by its adjacency matrix @xmath2 : @xmath3 represents an edge between nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 with weight @xmath6 , while @xmath7 if there is no such edge .",
    "note that we allow positive and negative weights , and self loops ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "any @xmath9 real symmetric matrix is the adjacency matrix of such a network .",
    "if the weights satisfy @xmath10 , we define the _ laplacian matrix _ as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the diagonal matrix of the node degrees @xmath13 ( in this manuscript , by _ degree _ we will always refer to weighted node degree as defined above . )      in this paper , we relate the adjacency and laplacian eigenvalues of a multilayer network to two quotient networks that occur naturally .",
    "the main theoretical result that we will exploit is that the eigenvalues of a quotient interlace the eigenvalues of its parent network .",
    "let @xmath14 and consider two sets of real numbers @xmath15 we say that the first set _ interlaces _ the second if @xmath16      suppose that @xmath17 is a partition of the node set of a network @xmath18 with adjacency matrix @xmath19 , and write @xmath20 .",
    "the subnetwork represented by @xmath21 can be thought of as a cluster , community , or layer , for example .",
    "the _ quotient network _ @xmath22 of @xmath18 is a coarsening of the network with respect to the partition .",
    "it has one node per cluster @xmath21 , and an edge from @xmath21 to @xmath23 weighted by an average connectivity from @xmath21 to @xmath23 @xmath24 where we have a choice for the size parameter @xmath25 : we will use either @xmath26 , or @xmath27 , or @xmath28 .",
    "we call the corresponding network the _ left quotient _ , the _",
    "right quotient _ and the _ symmetric quotient _ respectively .",
    "fortunately , the matrix @xmath29 has the same eigenvalues for the three choices of @xmath25 ( see appendix [ section : quotientmatrix ] ) .",
    "we refer by _ quotient network _ to any of these three spectrally - equivalent networks with adjacency matrix @xmath30 .",
    "observe that the symmetric quotient is undirected , while the left and right quotients are not , unless all clusters have the same size , @xmath31 for all @xmath32 .",
    "the key spectral result is that the adjacency eigenvalues of a quotient network interlace the adjacency eigenvalues of the parent network ( see appendix [ appendix : interlacing ] for a proof ) .",
    "the same result applies for laplacian eigenvalues , if the laplacian matrix of the quotient is defined appropriately , as explained below .",
    "consider the left quotient of @xmath33 with respect to the partition .",
    "observe that the row sums of @xmath34 are @xmath35 the average node degree in @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath36 be the diagonal matrix of the average node degrees .",
    "then we define the _ quotient laplacian _ as the matrix @xmath37 ( see appendix [ appendix : laplacian_quotients ] for a full discussion on this choice . ) with this definition , the laplacian eigenvalues of the quotient network interlace the laplacian eigenvalues of the parent network ( see the theorem in appendix [ appendix : laplacian_quotients ] ) .",
    "let @xmath38 be the _ loopless quotient _ of @xmath0 , that is , the quotient network @xmath39 with all the self - loops removed .",
    "as the quotient laplacian ignores self - loops ( see appendix [ appendix : laplacian_quotients ] ) , we have @xmath40 , and the interlacing result also holds for the loopless quotient .      a partition of the node set @xmath41 is called _ equitable _ if the number of edges ( taking weights into account ) from a node in @xmath21 to any node in @xmath23 is independent of the chosen node in @xmath21 @xmath42 for all @xmath32 .",
    "this indicates a regularity condition on the connection pattern between ( and within ) clusters .",
    "if the partition is equitable , we call the quotient network _ regular_. a source of regular quotients are network symmetries @xcite . for a toy example of a regular quotient ,",
    "see table [ table_adj ] .",
    "if the quotient is regular , the adjacency eigenvalues of @xmath39 not only interlace , but are a subset of the adjacency eigenvalues of @xmath0 and , moreover , we can find an eigenbasis of @xmath0 consisting on @xmath43 eigenvectors of the quotient _ lifted _ to @xmath0 ( by repeating the coordinates on each cluster ) , and the other @xmath44 eigenvectors _ orthogonal _ to the partition ( the sum of the coordinates on each layer is zero ) ; see table [ table_adj ] and appendix [ appendix : equitable ] .",
    "we refer to this spectral result as _ lifting_.    .[table_adj ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "now we turn to exploit the spectral results on quotient networks in the framework of multilayer networks . after introducing the multilayer network formalism , we discuss two naturally occurring quotients : the network of layers and the aggregate network .",
    "we also discuss layer subnetworks , as similar interlacing results apply .",
    "this is not surprising , as subnetworks and quotients are dual concepts in some abstract categorical sense @xcite .",
    "note that analogous results to those presented here will apply to arbitrary quotients or subnetworks on a multilayer network , and we only focus on the most natural ones . for the remainder",
    ", we implicitly assume the use of left quotients @xmath45 ( cf .",
    "section [ section : networkquotients ] ) .",
    "we adopt the language and formalism of @xcite . in most generality ,",

    "the pair @xmath56 is a graph called the _ underlying graph _ of the multilayer network .",
    "the _ supra - adjacency matrix _ of @xmath57 is the adjacency matrix of this graph . besides",
    ", each layer can be considered as a subgraph @xmath58 , where @xmath59 for each @xmath60 .",
    "we write @xmath61 for the adjacency matrix of @xmath62 .",
    "the supra - adjacency matrix @xmath63 has the matrices @xmath61 as diagonal blocks , while the off - diagonal blocks @xmath64 represent inter - layer connectivity .",
    "finally , we define the _ supra - laplacian matrix _ as the laplacian of the underlying graph @xmath65 .      the layers of a multilayer network partition the node set , so it is reasonable to consider the quotient induced by this partition .",
    "let @xmath66 be the partition of the multilayer node set by the layers , and @xmath67 .",
    "define the _ average inter - layer degree _ from @xmath52 to @xmath68 as @xmath69 this represents the average connectivity from a node in @xmath62 to any node in @xmath70 .",

    "we call this quotient the _ network of layers_. each node corresponds to a layer , with a self loop weighted by the average intra - layer degree @xmath72 , and there is a directed edge from layer @xmath52 to layer @xmath68 weighted by the average inter - layer degree @xmath75 .    alternatively , we could consider the spectrally equivalent symmetric quotient , by replacing @xmath76 by @xmath77 in eq .",
    "[ eqn : nol_weights ] , see section [ section : networkquotients ]",
    ". the network of layers will also be undirected if each layer contains the same number of nodes .    applying the spectral results of section [ section : networkquotients ] ,",
    "we conclude that the adjacency , respectively laplacian , eigenvalues of the network of layers interlace the adjacency , respectively laplacian , eigenvalues of the multilayer network .",
    "namely , if @xmath78 are the ( adjacency resp .",
    "laplacian ) eigenvalues of the network of layers , then @xmath79 where @xmath80 are the ( adjacency resp .",
    "laplacian ) eigenvalues of the multilayer network .",
    "the network of layers , ignoring weights and self - loops , simply represents the layer connection configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the connectivity of this reduced representation , measured in terms of the eigenvalues , thus relates to the connectivity of the entire multilayer network via the interlacing results .",
    "we turn to the question of when the layer partition is equitable .",
    "this requires , in particular , that the intra - layer degrees are constant , that is , each layer must be a @xmath72-regular graph , a very strong condition unlikely to be satisfied in real - world multiplexes .",
    "instead , we call a multilayer network _ regular _ if the layer partition is almost equitable , that is , the inter - layer connections are independent of the chosen vertices .",
    "this is a more natural condition , and examples of inter - layer connections which give rise to regular multilayers are all - to - all , empty or one - to - one connections with homogeneous weights @xcite .",
    "if the multilayer network is regular then , in addition to the interlacing , the laplacian eigenvalues of the network of layers are a subset of the laplacian eigenvalues of the multiplex , and we can lift a laplacian eigenbasis of the quotient , as described in section [ section : networkquotients ] . this latter result has also been derived in @xcite .",
    "the multilayer network formalism also includes information about nodes representing the same entity in several layers : given @xmath81 , we think of @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( if they are both multilayer nodes ) as two nodes representing the same entity in two layers @xmath84 .",
    "this allows a second notion of quotient , the _ aggregate network_.    the aggregate network is obtained by identifying nodes representing the same ` actor ' or ` component ' in different layers ( e.g.  same user in two social networks ; same hub in different transport networks ; multiplexes describing time series @xcite ) .",
    "this identification also makes sense for interdependent networks where the functioning of a node in a layer critically depends on the functioning of another node in another layer and vice versa @xcite .",
    "several candidates for this aggregate network have been proposed in the literature such as the average network @xcite , the overlapping network @xcite the projected monoplex network @xcite or the overlay network @xcite .",
    "we claim that the natural definition of an aggregate network is given by the suitable notion of quotient network , as follows .",
    "we define a _ supra - node _ as the set of nodes representing the same object @xmath85 note that not every node is present in every layer , and @xmath86 may have cardinality 1 .",
    "we call @xmath87 the _ multiplexity degree _ of the supra - node @xmath86 , that is , the number of layers in which an instance of the same object @xmath88 appears .",
    "we also define the _ average connectivity _ between supra - nodes @xmath86 and @xmath89 as @xmath90 and write @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "observe that the super - nodes partition the multilayer node set .",
    "we define the _ aggregate network _ as the quotient associated with this partition .",
    "each node in this quotient corresponds to a supra - node , with a self - loop weighted by @xmath91 , and a directed edge from @xmath86 to @xmath89 weighted by @xmath93 .",
    "alternatively , we could consider the symmetric quotient , which is an undirected network and has the same eigenvalues , by simply replacing @xmath94 by @xmath95 in eq .",
    "[ eqn : aggregate_weights ] .",
    "note that the aggregate network quotient will also be undirected if every supra - node has the same multiplexity degree ( cf .",
    "section [ section : networkquotients ] ) .    finally , using the spectral results of section [ section : networkquotients ] ,",
    "we conclude that the adjacency ( respectively laplacian ) eigenvalues of the aggregate network interlace the adjacency ( respectively laplacian ) eigenvalues of the multiplex .",
    "namely , in a multilayer network with @xmath1 nodes and @xmath96 supra - nodes , the ( adjacency resp .",
    "laplacian ) eigenvalues of the aggregate network quotient @xmath97 satisfy @xmath98 where @xmath80 are the ( adjacency resp .",
    "laplacian ) eigenvalues of the multilayer network .",
    "observe that requiring the aggregate network to be regular , or almost regular , is in this case very restrictive , as it would require that every pair of nodes connects in the same uniform way on every layer , and thus it is not likely to occur on real - world multilayer networks .",
    "the layers of a multiplex form evident subnetworks , and it is natural to relate the eigenvalues of each layer to the eigenvalues of the multiplex .",
    "as we have seen ( section [ section : subnetworks ] ) , the interlacing result applies to the adjacency eigenvalues of an induced subnetwork , such as the layers , and partial interlacing also holds for the laplacian eigenvalues .",
    "more precisely , if a layer subgraph @xmath62 has @xmath99 nodes and adjacency ( resp .",
    "laplacian ) eigenvalues @xmath100 , and @xmath80 are the adjacency ( resp .",
    "laplacian ) eigenvalues of the whole multilayer network , then @xmath101",
    "from a physical point of view , the adjacency and laplacian spectra of a network encode information on structural and dynamical properties of the system represented by the network .",
    "we now discuss some consequences and applications of the spectral results derived in the previous sections . in the following ,",
    "let us write @xmath102 for the @xmath4th smallest eigenvalue of a matrix @xmath33 .",
    "the spectrum of the adjacency matrix is directly related to different dynamical processes that take place on the system , such as spreading processes , for which it has been shown that critical properties are related to the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of this matrix . as an example , consider a contact process on the multilayer network @xmath57 whose dynamic is described by the equation @xmath103 in which @xmath104 is the probability of node @xmath4 to be infected at time @xmath105 , @xmath68 is the infection rate , @xmath106 is the recovery rate and @xmath6 are the elements of the supra - adjacency matrix @xmath107 . in this model ,",
    "each infected node contacts its neighbours with probability @xmath108 , and tries to infect them .",
    "the contact between two instances of the same object in different layers is modelled in the same way as the contact between any two other nodes ( the layer structure is ignored ) . the critical value for which the infection survives is given by @xmath109    from the interlacing result for the layer subnetworks ( section [ layerspectra ] ) we have that @xmath110 where @xmath61 is the adjacency matrix of the layer @xmath52 .",
    "this means that the critical point for the multilayer network @xmath111 is bounded from above by the corresponding critical points of the independent layers @xcite .",
    "this implies that the multilayer network is more efficient as far as a spreading processes are concerned than the most efficient of its layers on its own .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath112 is the largest adjacency eigenvalue of the network of layers , then ( section [ section : nol ] ) @xmath113 which means that the connections between layers also impose constraints to the dynamics on the multilayer network .",
    "in particular , the critical point of the spreading dynamics on the multilayer network is bounded from above by the corresponding critical point of the network of layers .",
    "note that this also explains the existence of a mixed phase @xcite .",
    "consider now the same process ( [ contact ] ) , this time defined on the aggregate network @xmath114 here @xmath115 are the elements of @xmath116 , the adjacency matrix of the aggregate graph .",
    "the critical value is given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the number of supra - nodes in @xmath57 ( the size of the aggregate network ) . from the interlacing result we have that @xmath119 therefore the spreading process on @xmath57 is at least as efficient as the same spreading process on the aggregate network .",
    "note that equations [ contact ] and [ agcontact ] describe two rather different processes , that is , two different strategies that actors can adopt in order to spread information across the multilayer network . in the former",
    ", a node can infect any other node on any layer , while in the latter , each supra - node chooses at each time step with uniform probability a layer in which an instance representing it is present and then contacts all its neighbours in that layer .",
    "our results show that the former strategy is more effective than the latter , as expressed by the relation between the critical points .",
    "the laplacian of a network @xmath120 is the operator of the dynamical process described by @xmath121 where @xmath122 represents the transition probability of a particle from node @xmath4 to node @xmath5 at time @xmath105 .",
    "the second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix sets the time scale of the process . from the interlacing results applied to the laplacian matrix we have that for any quotient @xmath123 that is",
    ", the relaxation time on the multiplex is at most the relaxation time on any quotient , in particular the network of layers or the aggregate network .",
    "if we interpret @xmath124 of a network laplacian as algebraic connectivity @xcite , eq .  [ layernet ] means that the algebraic connectivity of the multilayer network is always bounded above by the algebraic connectivity of any of its quotients .    as a more concrete example of the above ,",
    "consider a multilayer network describing a time series .",
    "then the network of layers is a path graph on @xmath43 nodes ( the number of layers ) and hence @xmath125 this means that in this case the relaxation time is proportional to the length of the time series , as one would expect .    on the other hand ,",
    "the laplacian of the aggregated network is the operator corresponding to the dynamical process described by @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the transition probability of a particle from supra - node @xmath128 to supra - node @xmath129 at time @xmath105 , @xmath130 are the elements of the adjacency matrix of the aggregated contact network , @xmath131 is the laplacian matrix of the aggregate contact network ( i.e.  @xmath132 ) and @xmath133 is the degree of a supra - node .",
    "note that if we define the overlapping degree @xcite of a supra - node as @xmath134 then we have that @xmath135 from the interlacing result for the laplacian we have that @xmath136 that is , the diffusion process on the aggregate network ( eq .",
    "[ aggregatediff ] ) is faster than the diffusion process on the entire multilayer network ( eq .  [ multidiff ] ) .",
    "note that in @xcite , in a setting in which all nodes are connected to a counterpart in each layer , the authors obtained by means of a perturbative analysis that @xmath137 when the diffusion parameter between layers is large enough . in @xcite this result is generalized ( in a different framework , since they are interested in structural properties of interdependent networks ) to all almost regular multilayer networks . in the framework of quotient networks that we have presented here",
    "those results arise in a very natural way .",
    "besides , eigenvalue interlacing between multilayer and quotient eigenvalues holds for every possible inter - layer connection scheme .    in the context of synchronization",
    ", the smallest non - zero laplacian eigenvalue @xmath124 is also related to the stability of a synchronized state @xcite , and indeed the larger @xmath124 is , the more stable is the synchronized state . considering a multilayer network , the bound in ( [ layernet ] )",
    "means that the synchronized state of a system supported on the multilayer network is at most as stable as the synchronized state on any of its quotients .",
    "we have presented the network quotient formalism in the context of multilayer networks , highlighting the two most natural quotients , the network of layers , and the aggregate network .",
    "structurally , a quotient can be thought as a dimensionality reduction of a multilayer network . in terms of spectra",
    ", we have showed that eigenvalue interlacing applies to the adjacency and laplacian eigenvalues of any quotient , and also to subnetworks such as the layer subnetwork .",
    "we needed in particular a definition of quotient laplacian , and to relate its eigenvalues to those of a laplacian of the quotient network .",
    "we have also investigated regularity of the inter - layer connectivity , which gives a stronger lifting result on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors . finally , we have discussed possible applications of our results , including reproducing previous results in the literature obtained by other means such as perturbative analysis .",
    "we argue that the notion of quotient is closely intertwined to that of multilayer network , as the latter formally corresponds to an ordinary network with additional layer and node identification information .",
    "thinking of a network quotient as a partition or identification of its node set , a multilayer network can be indeed recovered from its underlying network and these two quotients , the network of layers , and the aggregate network .",

    "if the quotient is regular , the spectrum of @xmath33 decomposes into the spectrum of @xmath30 lifted to @xmath33 ( i.e.  eigenvectors constant on each @xmath197 ) , and the remaining spectrum is orthogonal to the partition ( i.e.  eigenvectors with coordinates adding to zero on each @xmath197 ) :    let @xmath30 be the quotient matrix of @xmath33 with respect to an equitable partition with characteristic matrix @xmath184 . then the spectrum of @xmath30 is a subset of the spectrum of @xmath33 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath199 is an eigenpair of @xmath30 if and only if @xmath200 is an eigenpair of @xmath33 .",
    "+ moreover , there is an eigenbasis of @xmath33 of the form @xmath201 such that @xmath202 is any eigenbasis of @xmath30 , and @xmath203 for all @xmath4 .",

    "[ eqn : equitable ] ( note that @xmath205 as @xmath206 ) . for the second part , note that @xmath184 is an isomorphism onto @xmath207 , as it has trivial kernel , so @xmath208 is a basis of @xmath207 .",
    "it is easy to show that the orthogonal complement @xmath209 equals @xmath210 , hence we can complete the linearly independent set of eigenvectors @xmath208 to a eigenbasis of @xmath211 .",
    "we want to show that the laplacian of a quotient graph is the quotient of the laplacian matrix , as this will allow us to extend the interlacing results to the laplacian eigenvalues .",
    "first , we need to clarify what we mean by the laplacian of a non - symmetric matrix .",
    "if @xmath138 is a real symmetric ( adjacency ) matrix , define the _ node out - degrees _ as @xmath212 the _ out - degree laplacian _ is the matrix @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the diagonal matrix of the out - degrees .",
    "we define @xmath215 , @xmath216 and the _ in - degree laplacian _",
    "analogously . note that both laplacian matrices ignore the diagonal values of @xmath33 .",
    "( if @xmath33 is the adjacency matrix of a graph , we say that the laplacian ` ignores self - loops ' . )",
    "consider the left and right quotients of @xmath33 with respect to a given partition .",
    "observe that the row sums of @xmath34 are @xmath35 the average node degree in @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath36 be the diagonal matrix of the average node degrees .",
    "then we define the _ quotient laplacian _ as the matrix @xmath218 that is , the out - degree laplacian of the left quotient matrix .",

    "( note that there is no obvious way of interpreting the symmetric quotient @xmath220 as the laplacian of a graph . )",
    "we finish by studying equitable partitions in the context of laplacian matrices .",
    "we demonstrate that a partition being regular for the laplacian matrix is equivalent to the partition being almost regular for the adjacency matrix .",
    "in particular , the spectral results of appendix [ appendix : equitable ] will hold for almost regular quotients and laplacian eigenvalues .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph with adjacency matrix @xmath33 and laplacian matrix @xmath55 .",
    "then a partition is equitable with respect to @xmath55 if and only if it is almost equitable with respect to @xmath33 .    by relabeling the nodes if necessary",
    ", we can assume the block decomposition @xmath223 where the @xmath149 submatrix @xmath144 represents the edges from @xmath21 to @xmath23 .",
    "the matrix @xmath55 has then a similar block decomposition into submatrices @xmath224 .",
    "as @xmath225 and @xmath170 is diagonal , we have @xmath226 for all @xmath227 .",
    "in particular , the row sums of @xmath224 are constant if and only if the row sums of @xmath144 is constant , for all @xmath228 . on the other hand ,",
    "as the row sums in @xmath55 are zero , the row sums in @xmath229 equals the sum of the row sums of the matrices @xmath224 for @xmath230 , and the result follows .",
    "the adjacency eigenvalues of an induced subgraph interlace those of the graph , as per the first corollary in appendix [ appendix : interlacing ]",
    ". however , they do not behave well for factor subgraphs @xcite . for the laplacian eigenvalues",
