    "it is generally believed that the inhomogeneous larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrell ( loff ) phase appears in a superconductor when the pairing between different fermion species is under the circumstances of mismatched fermi surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the mismatched fermi surfaces are normally induced by the zeeman energy splitting @xmath0 in a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "early studies of the loff phase were restricted to 1d structures , which include the fulde - ferrell ( ff ) state  @xcite with a plane - wave order parameter @xmath1 and the larkin - ovhinnikov ( lo ) state  @xcite with an antipodal - wave order parameter @xmath2 . for @xmath3-wave pairing at weak coupling , it is known that the ff or lo state exists in a narrow window @xmath4 , where the lower critical field @xmath5 and the upper critical field @xmath6  @xcite with @xmath7 being the pairing gap at vanishing mismatch . however , since the thermodynamic critical field is much lower than @xmath8 due to strong orbit effect , it is rather hard to observe the loff state in ordinary superconductors @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "experimental evidences for the loff state in some superconducting materials have been reported  @xcite .",
    "the studies of color superconductivity in dense quark matter promoted new interests in the loff state @xcite .",
    "color superconductivity in dense quark matter appears due to the attractive interactions in certain diquark channels  @xcite . under the compact star constraints , different quark flavors ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath3 )",
    "acquire mismatched fermi surfaces because of the beta equilibrium and the electric charge neutrality . on the other hand , recent experiments on ultracold atomic fermi gases",
    "provided a controllable way to study the fermion superfluidity with population imbalance  @xcite .",
    "quark color superconductors under compact star constraints as well as atomic fermi gases with population imbalance are rather clean systems to realize the long - sought loff phase .",
    "in addition to the simple ff and lo states , there exist a variety of crystal structures .",
    "the general form of the crystal structure of the order parameter can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath11 a specific crystal structure corresponds to a multi - wave configuration determined by the @xmath12 unit vectors @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) . around the tricritical point in the temperature - mismatch phase diagram",
    ", the loff phase can be studied rigorously by using the ginzburg - laudau ( gl ) analysis since both the gap parameter @xmath15 and the pair momentum @xmath16 are vanishingly small @xcite .",
    "it was found that the lo state is preferred near the tricritical point  @xcite . however , the real ground state of the loff phase is still not quite clear due to the limited theoretical approaches at zero temperature .",
    "various theoretical approaches suggested that the loff state has a complicated crystal structure near its phase transition to the normal state  @xcite .",
    "a recent self - consistent treatment of the 1d modulation showed that a solitonic lattice structure is preferred near the phase transition to the bcs state  @xcite .",
    "the gl free energy is important for us to understand the nature of the phase transition to the normal state and to search for the most preferred crystal structure near the phase transition point . in a pioneer work ,",
    "bowers and rajagopal investigated 23 crystal structures at weak coupling by using the gl approach  @xcite .",
    "they evaluated the gl free energy up to the sixth order in @xmath15 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the density of state at the fermi surface .",
    "the coefficient @xmath19 is universal for all crystal structures and is given by  @xcite @xmath20.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] near the conventional second - order phase transition point @xmath21 with the optimal pair momentum @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 . the gl approach is meaningful if the phase transition is of second order or weak first order .",
    "the gl coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 for 23 crystal structures were evaluated in  @xcite . for most of the structures , we find @xmath26 , which leads to first - order phase transitions . among the structures with @xmath27",
    ", the favored one seems to be the body - centered cubic ( bcc ) structure with @xmath28 .",
    "the order parameter can be expressed as @xmath29.\\ ] ] further , it was _ conjectured _ that the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) structure with @xmath30 is the most preferred structure since both @xmath24 and @xmath25 are negative and their absolute values are the largest  @xcite .",
    "the order parameter can be expressed as @xmath31 for the bcc structure , the gl free energy up to the sixth order in @xmath15 predicts a _ strong first - order _ phase transition at @xmath32 with a large gap parameter @xmath33 at @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "the prediction of a strong first - order phase transition indicates that the gl approach is not valid or the higher - order terms in @xmath15 are important . for the fcc structure ,",
    "the gl free energy up to the sixth order in @xmath15 actually gives _ no prediction _ because both @xmath24 and @xmath25 are negative .",
    "on the other hand , there exist some other approaches that do not use the gl approximation .",
    "combescot and mora employed eilenberger s quasiclassical equation with a fourier expansion for the order parameter  @xcite .",
    "this approach predicted that the bcc - normal phase transition is of _ rather weak first order _ : the upper critical field @xmath35 is only @xmath36 higher than @xmath37 and @xmath38 at @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "for the fcc structure , it was found that its upper critical field is only @xmath39 higher than @xmath37 and hence it is less favored than bcc .",
    "another study employed a solid - state - like approach which calculated the free energy of the bcc structure by directly diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix in the bloch space  @xcite .",
    "this approach also predicted that the bcc - normal phase transition is of weak first order and the upper critical field of bcc is slightly higher than @xmath37 .",
    "the contradiction between the predictions from the above approaches and from the gl approach indicates that the higher - order terms in the gl free energy are rather important for a quantitative prediction .",
    "actually , for a first - order phase transition , the higher - order expansions are crucial to determine whether the first - order transition is weak or strong . for an intuitive understanding ,",
    "let us add the eighth - order term in the gl free energy for the bcc structure .",
    "we have @xmath40 as a naive example , we assume @xmath41 . for @xmath42 , we obtain a strong first - order phase transition . however , the first - order phase transition becomes weaker and weaker if we increase the value of @xmath43 . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the phase transition approaches second order and @xmath45 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath43 is small or even negative , the higher - order terms such as @xmath46 may become important .",
    "therefore , to give more precise predictions within the gl approach we need to evaluate the gl free energy to a sufficiently high order in @xmath15 .",
    "actually , if we can evaluate the gl free energy to arbitrary order and determine the convergence properties of the gl series , we may even treat the strong first - order phase transition within the gl approach .",
    "the higher - order gl coefficients can be evaluated by using the diagrammatic approach used in  @xcite . in this approach , to evaluate the @xmath47-th order gl coefficient one needs to sum all possible configurations that satisfy the momentum constraint @xmath48 for a set of @xmath47 wave vectors @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "for large @xmath51 , the number of the configurations becomes very large for the crystal structures with large number of waves @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , one needs to introduce @xmath47 feynman parameters to evaluate the integrals .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the higher - order terms is tedious and complicated in this formalism .    in this work",
    ", we introduce a new derivation of the gl free energy based on a solid - state physics approach to the crystal structures .",
    "this derivation provides a simple matrix formalism for the gl coefficients without any momentum constraint .",
    "we find that the formalism used in  @xcite and our formalism can be attributed to two different _ representations _ of the fermion field : the diagrammatic approach  @xcite employs the usual continuous momentum representation , while our derivation uses the discrete bloch representation .",
    "since the matrix operations can be easily realized by using a computer , this new formalism may enable us to calculate the gl free energy to arbitrary order in @xmath15 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec . [ s2 ] we briefly review the diagrammatic approach to the gl free energy . in sec .",

    "we focus on the general two - flavor pairing at high density , low temperature , and weak coupling . in this case , the antiparticle degrees of freedom play no role .",

    "we shall neglect all other internal degrees of freedom , such as color and spin .",
    "these degrees of freedom contribute a simple degenerate factor and can be absorbed into the definition of the density of state @xmath18 at the fermi surface .",
    "the fermion chemical potentials are specified by the diagonal matrix @xmath59 in the flavor space , where @xmath60 here @xmath61 plays the role of the mismatch between the fermi surfaces .",
    "for ultra - relativistic fermion systems such as dense quark matter we take @xmath62 .",
    "the model also works for nonrelativistic fermion systems such as cold atomic fermi gases . in this case",
    "we take @xmath63 ( we set the fermion mass @xmath64 with proper units ) .",
    "weak coupling requires that the pairing gap @xmath7 at @xmath65 is much smaller than the fermi energy @xmath66 . at weak coupling , the physical results should be universal if we properly scale the physical quantities by using the pairing gap @xmath7 and the density of states @xmath18 at the fermi surface .    to evaluate the gl free energy , we start from the partition function @xmath67 of the system . in the imaginary time formalism , it is given by @xmath68[d\\psi^\\dagger]e^{-{\\cal s}_{\\rm eff}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the euclidean action @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the imaginary time and @xmath71 is the temperature .",
