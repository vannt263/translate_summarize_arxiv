    "nowadays , with the rising statistics of charm samples , the decays of charm mesons can be seen as a new source for the study of light meson spectroscopy , complementary to that from scattering experiments , and can be particularly relevant to the understanding of the scalar sector .",
    "recently , fermilab experiment e791 reported on the indication of a light scalar @xmath1 resonance @xcite , @xmath2 , based on a full dalitz plot analysis of the decay @xmath0 .",
    "the measured breit - wigner mass and width of this state were found to be @xmath3 mev / c@xmath4 and @xmath5 mev / c@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "fermilab e791 has also observed evidence for the scalar @xmath6 meson in @xmath7 decays @xcite and measured @xmath8 masses and widths in @xmath9 decays @xcite .    here , we briefly review the @xmath10 methodology and the results obtained .",
    "moreover , we present new , preliminary studies providing further information on the phase variation of the scalar sector at low mass .",
    "we first present a study of the interference of @xmath11 and underlying amplitudes as an attempt to measure the phase motion of the scalar low - mass @xmath1 amplitude .",
    "a more extensive study comes afterwards , where we try a set of fit models inspired by the lass parametrization for the s - wave @xmath1 amplitude @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to check whether a unitary , isolated , s - wave @xmath1 amplitude can fit the @xmath0 dalitz plot , together with the other ( higher - spin ) intermediate states .",
    "we show that this approach is not adequate for the data , and present similar parametrizations where final - state interactions are included for the s - wave components , as is usually done in dalitz plot analyses .",
    "in particular , we present a result offering further support for a rapidly - varying phase at low @xmath1 mass , consistent with the previous indication of a light , broad @xmath2 in @xmath0 .",
    "from the original @xmath12 events collected by fermilab e791 @xcite , and after reconstruction and selection criteria , we obtained the @xmath13 mass spectrum shown in fig.[kpipi](a ) .",
    "the sample of 15,090 events shown in the crosshatched area is used for the dalitz plot analysis of @xmath0 , from which about 6% is due to background .",
    "the dalitz plot of these events are shown in fig.[kpipi](b ) , where the axes represent the two invariant mass squared combinations @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( the kaon is labeled particle 1 , the two pions are particles 2 and 3 ) .    for the dalitz plot analysis , an unbinned maximum - likelihood fit was performed with probability distribution funtions ( pdf s ) for both signal and background .",
    "the signal pdf was written as the square of the total physical amplitude @xmath16 and it is weighted by the acceptance across the dalitz plot and by the level of signal to background for each event .    many @xmath17 resonances could contribute to the final state by forming quasi 2-body intermediate states @xmath18 , as well as a possible non - resonant ( nr ) 3-body decay .",
    "due to the possibility of rescattering of these intermediate states from final state interactions ( fsi ) , a general ansatz , widely use in dalitz analyses of @xmath19 decays to describe the total decay amplitude , is given by @xmath20 this equation uses lorentz invariant amplitudes @xmath21 to describe the individual resonant and nr processes , with relative strenghts given by the magnitudes @xmath22 and strong phases @xmath23 to account for fsi .",
    "the nr amplitude @xmath24 is usually assumed constant and set to 1 .",
    "the resonant amplitudes are written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the relativistic breit - wigner propagator , @xmath27^{-1}$ ] , the quantities @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the blatt - weisskopf damping factors respectively for the @xmath19 and the @xmath1 resonances and @xmath30 describes the angular function according to the spin @xmath31 of the resonance .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes are generally functions of both dalitz variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 . here , with two identical pions in the final state , each amplitude is bose symmetrized @xmath32 + { \\cal a}_n[({\\bf 13}){\\bf 2}]$ ] .",
    "invariant mass spectrum .",
    "the filled area is background ; ( b ) dalitz plot corresponding to the events in the crosshatched area of ( a ) .",
    "[ kpipi ] , width=264 ]    ( a )     invariant mass spectrum .",
    "the filled area is background ; ( b ) dalitz plot corresponding to the events in the crosshatched area of ( a ) .",
    "[ kpipi ] , width=264 ]    ( b )    the first approach to fit the data includes the known @xmath17 resonances plus a constant nr term .",
    "this is called model a. it finds contributions from the channels : nr , with a decay fraction over 90% , followed by @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; these values are in accordance with previous results from fermilab e691@xcite and fermilab e687@xcite .",
    "see fit fractions and relative phases in table [ tablekappa ] .",
    "there is an important destructive interference pattern , since all fractions add up to 140% .",
    "important disagreements appear between the fit to model a and data , with @xmath37 ( @xmath38 being the number of degrees of freedom ) in a binned version of the dalitz plot .",
    "the discrepancies are found mainly at low @xmath1 mass squared ( below 0.8 @xmath39 ) and near 2.5 @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "thus , a model with the known @xmath1 resonances , plus a constant nr amplitude , is not able to describe the @xmath0 dalitz plot satisfactorily .",
    "a second model ( model b ) allows the mass and width of the scalar @xmath40 to float , and includes gaussian form - factors @xcite .",
    "the resulting fractions and phases are similar to those of model a ( within errors ) and the mass and width of @xmath40 are found to be consistent with pdg values .",
    "the fit improves but it is still unsatisfactory .",
    "a third fit model , model c , is constructed by the inclusion of an extra scalar state , with unconstrained mass and width . the mass and width of the @xmath40 are also free parameters , and gaussian form - factors are used as in model b. using this model , the values obtained are @xmath3 mev / c@xmath4 for the mass and @xmath5 mev / c@xmath4 for the width of the new scalar state , here referred to as the @xmath2 .",
    "the values of mass and width obtained for the @xmath40 are respectively @xmath41 mev / c@xmath4 and @xmath42 mev / c@xmath4 , appearing heavier and narrower than presented by the pdg .",
    "the fit fractions and phases from models c are shown in table [ tablekappa ] .",
    "compared to the results of model a ( without @xmath2 ) , the nr mode drops from over 90% to 13% .",
    "the @xmath43 state is now dominant , with a decay fraction about 50% .",
    "moreover , the fit quality of model c is substantially superior to that of model a ; the @xmath44 is now 0.73 .",
    ".results without @xmath2 ( model a ) and with @xmath2 ( model c ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tablekappa ]    from the results of the dalitz plot analysis of @xmath0 , one concludes that a conventional approach , including known @xmath1 resonances and a constant nr term , can not describe the data .",
    "the presence of a broad , light scalar @xmath1 state , @xmath2 , provides a very good description of the data and becomes the major contribution to the decay .",
    "many other possibilities were tried with no sucess , for instance a toy model for which the extra state is represented by a breit - wigner without phase variation , vector and tensor hypotheses , different parametrizations for the nr channel , etc .",
    "as described above , we obtain a very good description of the @xmath0 data by the inclusion of the @xmath2 in the decay amplitude .",
    "a scalar resonant phase behavior seems to be required at low mass .",
    "nevertheless , it is desirable to investigate further , and independently of the breit - wigner hypothesis .    here",
    ", we present new studies in order to provide further information on the phase behavior of the scalar amplitude at low mass .",
    "a first study refers to the asymmetry of the @xmath11 and we show that there is no sensivity to the @xmath2 phase motion at the @xmath11 mass in the crossed channel , although an indication of it can be seen at lower and higher mass . a second ,",
    "more important study , refers to a comparison with the results of the s - wave @xmath1 amplitude from lass , composed of a non - resonant background ( with effective range parametrization ) and the @xmath40 .",
    "the main results we obtain are the inability to describe the data by imposing a @xmath1 elastic unitarity constraint but , on the other hand , the features of the phase motion obtained after this imposition is released .",
    "a suggestion has been made to us @xcite to see whether the phase motion of the @xmath2 could be inferred through the interference of the @xmath11 with the broad , underlying amplitude . from fig.[kpipi](a ) a strong asymmetry in the interference of the @xmath11 is evident in the dalitz plot .",
    "this asymmetry is due to the interference with the dominant scalar component at low mass , i.e. , the nr component in model a ( without @xmath2 ) or the broad @xmath2 in model c. in the following , we will explore this possibility .",
    "if one plots the phase of the @xmath2 breit - wigner ( @xmath45 ) with central mass and width obtained by e791 ( 797 mev / c@xmath4 and 410 mev / c@xmath4 , respectively ) one sees that there is a sharp increasing of the phase from threshold up to about 1 gev / c@xmath4 ( see fig.[phasebw ] ) . above 1 gev / c@xmath4 ,",
    "the increase is slow .",
    "now , we want to study the @xmath2 phase motion in @xmath46 by inspection of the @xmath47 distribution of @xmath11 ( @xmath48 being the decay angle of the @xmath49 in the center - of - mass frame of @xmath11 with respect to the @xmath19 direction ) within 0.8 and 1.0 gev / c@xmath4 in the crossed channel , @xmath50 . by observing the dalitz plot",
    ", we see that for @xmath51 gev / c@xmath4 , the allowed kinematical region of the crossed channel is @xmath46 .5ex 1 gev / c@xmath4 . decay .",
    "when looking at a low - mass region in one channel , let s say @xmath52 gev / c@xmath4@xmath4 ( just below @xmath11 mass ) we are at the same time observing a higher region of @xmath15 , above 1.3 @xmath39 .",
    "this is a result of having two identical pions in the decay .",
    "thus , the presence of the @xmath2 in this decay , especially its phase variation , would reflect itself at low and high @xmath1 mass ( respectively below 0.8 gev / c@xmath4 and above 1.5 gev / c@xmath4 ) .",
    "] thus , we can anticipate that the study of the @xmath11 asymmetry will miss the main @xmath2 phase variation in the crossed channel .     for a scalar @xmath1 resonance with mass 797 mev / c@xmath4 and width 410 mev / c@xmath4,width=9 ]    from the data",
    ", this fact becomes evident . in fig.[costheta ] , we plot the @xmath47 distributions ( a ) within the @xmath11 mass region and ( b ) for low and high @xmath1 masses ( outside the @xmath11 region ) . for all plots , we compare the data ( points with error bars ) to the result of our fit models with and without @xmath2 . from fig.[costheta](a )",
    "it is clear that it is not possible to distinguish between the models .",
    "nevertheless , for low and high @xmath1 masses shown in fig.[costheta](b ) we see that the model without @xmath2 gives a poor description of the distributions , while the model with @xmath2 describes them adequately . as a complementary view ,",
    "the asymmetry distribution is obtained by plotting @xmath47 weighted by the number of events in each @xmath1 mass bin between 0.8 and 1.0 gev / c@xmath4 . for e791 data ,",
    "the distribution is shown in fig.[costhetaweight ] with error bars . in the same figure ,",
    "both models with ( model a ) and without @xmath2 ( model c ) are compared to the data distribution .",
    "both reproduce very well the asymmetry observed for the @xmath11 .",
    "thus , using only this information one would not claim the necessity of the @xmath2 in the @xmath0 decay . on the other hand , the effects of the @xmath2 can be seen below the @xmath11 mass or further above it , as shown before .",
    "it is worthwhile to comment on the asymmetry reported by fermilab focus @xcite in their analysis of the decay @xmath53 , where the @xmath11 was found to interfere with a small scalar component with a phase of @xmath54 .",
    "there , no fsi phases are expected , thus a comparison with the phases of @xmath0 , as suggested by @xcite , could be far from being direct ( see more discussion in the next section ) .",
    "distribution : ( a ) within the @xmath11 region ( 0.80.9 gev / c@xmath4 ) ; ( b ) for low ( @xmath55 gev / c@xmath4 ) and high ( @xmath56 gev / c@xmath4 ) @xmath1 mass [ costheta ] , width=8 ]    ( a )     distribution : ( a ) within the @xmath11 region ( 0.80.9 gev / c@xmath4 ) ; ( b ) for low ( @xmath55 gev / c@xmath4 ) and high ( @xmath56 gev / c@xmath4 ) @xmath1 mass [ costheta ] , width=8 ]    ( b )     for @xmath1 mass between 0.8 and 1.0 gev / c@xmath4 .",
    "error bars represent the data , model a is shown as the dotted histogram , and model c as the solid - line histogram.,width=9 ]      a set of studies was performed to compare the features of the s - wave @xmath1 components in the @xmath0 decays to the s - wave measured by lass experiment @xcite on elastic @xmath1 scattering .",
    "it is interesting to discuss here the differences between these two environments .",
    "we will be comparing production to a scattering process . for @xmath19 decays",
    ", it is known that fsi can play an important role ; explicitly there is the possibility of rescattering between quasi two - body states , @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 are any of the @xmath1 resonances ) .",
    "thus the presence of the bachelor pion can have an influence on the process , in this case not being isolated from @xmath1 .",
    "one consequence of this fact would be the loss of unitarity in the @xmath1 system .",
    "this is what we want to check .",
    "the idea here is to try the same parametrization used by lass to see whether the s - wave phase motion observed by them could represent the @xmath0 data .",
    "their s - wave ( up to the inelastic threshold ) had two terms : a non - resonant term , described through an effective - range form , and a relativistic breit - wigner for @xmath40 .",
    "no low - mass scalar resonance was observed .",
    "we will try this same kind of approach in two ways .",
    "first , we impose the exact form they used , which implies the imposition of @xmath1 elastic unitarity .",
    "then , we release this restriction .",
    "the amplitude of the s - wave used by lass , translated to a d decay ( instead of scattering ) needs a phase space correction given by @xmath59 ( mass of the resonance and decay momentum in the resonance frame , respectively ) . in the first fit ,",
    "fit 1 , the relative strength and phase for nr and @xmath60 are fixed by imposing the unitarity constraint on the @xmath1 system , so the total s - wave amplitude is written as : @xmath61 with @xmath62 and the nr term has the effective range form : @xmath63     is shown through the dashed line.,width=8 ]    the values obtained by lass in their fit were @xcite : @xmath64 from these values , we plot the s - wave phase motion they found from their data in fig.[lassphase ] .    the total amplitude describing the @xmath0 decay is written as a coherent sum of the above s - wave term ( eq.[lassfix ] ) and the other resonant states with spin @xmath65 . the relative strenghts and phases ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 below ) are let free in the fit : @xmath68 when we fit the data with this model , we obtain a very bad representation .",
    "the @xmath44 is 10.6 .",
    "this is evidence for the fact that the imposition of the @xmath1 unitarity constraint for the s - wave does not work here : the s - wave @xmath1 system is not isolated .",
    "let us now drop the constraint of elastic unitarity in the @xmath1 system , and use a model closer to what is the usual dalitz plot approach , where the presence of fsi is included through extra strong phases for _ all _ contributing channels . as before , the scalar components included are the nr ( parametrized as effective range ) and the @xmath40 but each of them now has an independent magnitude and phase .",
    "thus , the total decay amplitude for @xmath0 is being written as : @xmath69 using this approach , we try two fits : in fit 2 , we fix the parameters of the scalar components to the values obtained by lass , shown in eq.[lasspars ] . for fit 3 , these parameters ( @xmath70 ) are allowed to float .",
    "our results for fit 2 are much better than those for fit 1 .",
    "nevertheless they are very much like the results for model a - the fit with a constant nr term , and without @xmath2 .",
    "the quality of fit 2 is still not good ( @xmath71 ) and the nr term appears with an enormous fraction of about 120% .",
    "our results for fit 3 , on the other hand , are very interesting .",
    "we use the amplitude as in eq.[lass_nounit ] , but releasing the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and the mass and width of @xmath40 . in this case",
    ", we obtain a good description of the data .",
    "the values obtained for these parameters are : @xmath74 comparing to the best model , where @xmath2 is included ( model c ) , we observe : the fit qualities are comparable ( the model with @xmath2 is slightly better ) ; the mass and the width of the @xmath40 agree ; the fraction of the non - resonant in fit 3 ( @xmath75% ) is similar to the sum of the nr and @xmath2 in model c ; results for the other states agree .",
    "a very interesting feature of fit 3 is the negative value for @xmath73 . in this case",
    ", the `` effective - range '' would be indicating a resonant behavior .",
    "to better show this effect , we plot in fig.[phasefit3 ] the @xmath76 phase motion of the `` nr '' decay in fit 3 for the fitted values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "note that the phase increases very rapidly from threshold .",
    "this effect is similar to the effect we found for @xmath2 . here in fit 3",
    ", the `` effective - range '' phase would be replacing that for a constant nr and the @xmath2 in model c ( also shown in the figure ) ; the two curves are very similar , even more if one realizes that one is mainly the result of a breit - wigner shape for the @xmath2 and the other comes from what would be an effective - range form ( but turned out to have an impressive phase variation ) . for comparison ,",
    "the curve of @xmath76 with the parameters obtained by lass are also shown : an almost constant phase for the nr was observed .",
    "we see that the scalar sector at low @xmath1 mass in @xmath0 needs a rapidly - varying phase , consistent with the previous indication of the @xmath2 state from @xcite .",
    "using the fermilab e791 data sample of @xmath0 , we present new , preliminary studies offering further information concerning the phase motion behavior of the scalar amplitude at low @xmath1 mass . in particular , we showed that the s - wave phase motion as measured by lass in a scattering process is not able to describe the e791 decay data .",
    "this result shows the significance of final - state interactions in @xmath19 decays preventing a direct comparison of the phases in scattering and decay processes .",
    "furthermore , an independent parametrization ( without using a breit - wigner ) provided a phase behavior consistent to what we found previously for the scalar low - mass @xmath1 amplitude as a @xmath2 meson .",
