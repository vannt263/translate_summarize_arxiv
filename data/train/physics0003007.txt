    "analysis of heat engines has been a major source of thermodynamic insight .",

    "analysis of a virtual heat engine by szilard led to the connection between thermodynamics and information theory @xcite .",
    "recently this connection has been extended to the regime of quantum computation @xcite .",
    "quantum models of heat engines show a remarkable similarity to engines obeying macroscopic dynamics .",
    "the carnot efficiency is a well established limit for the efficiency of lasers as well as other quantum engines @xcite .",
    "moreover , even the irreversible operation of quantum engines with finite power output has many similarities to macroscopic endo - reversible engines @xcite .",
    "it is this line of thought that serves as a motivation for a detailed analysis of a discrete four stroke quantum engine . in a previous study @xcite ,",
    "the same model served to find the limits of the finite time performance of such an engine but with the emphasis on power optimization . in that study",
    "the working medium was composed of discrete level systems with the dynamics governed by a master equation .",
    "the purpose was to gain insight into the optimal engine s performance with respect to time allocation when external parameters such as : the applied fields , the bath temperatures and the relaxation rates were fixed .",
    "the present analysis emphasizes the reverse operation of the heat engine as a heat pump . for an adequate description of this mode of operation",
    "inner friction has to be a consideration . without it",
    "the model is deficient with respect to optimizing the cooling power .",
    "another addition is the optimization of the external fields .",
    "this is a common practice when cold temperatures are approached . with the addition of these two attributes ,",
    "the four stroke quantum model is analyzed both as a heat engine and as a refrigerator .",
    "inner friction is found to have a profound influence on performance of the refrigerator .",
    "a direct consequence of the friction is a lower bound on the cycle time .",
    "this lower bound excludes the non - realistic global optimization solutions found for frictionless cases @xcite where the cooling power can be optimized beyond bounds .",
    "this observation , has led to the suggestion of replacing the optimization of the cooling power by the optimization of the cooling efficiency per unit time @xcite .",
    "including friction is therefore essential for more realistic models of heat engines and refrigerators with the natural optimization goal becomes either the power output or the cooling power .",
    "the source of friction is not considered explicitly in the present model .",
    "physically friction is the result of non - adiabatic phenomena which are the result of the rapid change in the energy level structure of the system .",
    "for example friction can be caused by the missalignement of the external fields with the internal polarization of the working medium .",
    "for a more explicit description of the friction the interactions between the individual particles composing the working fluid have to be considered .",
    "the present model is a microscopic analogue of the ericsson refrigeration cycle @xcite where the working fluid consists of magnetic salts .",
    "the advantage of the microscopic model is that the use of the phenomenological heat transfer laws can be avoided @xcite .",
    "the results of the present model are compared to a recent analysis of macroscopic chillers @xcite . in that study , a universal modeling was demonstrated .",
    "it is found that the discrete quantum version of heat pumps has behavior similar to that of macroscopic chillers .",
    "there is a growing interest in the topic of cooling atoms and molecules to temperatures very close to absolute zero @xcite .",
    "most of the analysis of the cooling schemes employed are based on quantum dynamical models .",
    "new insight can be gained by employing a thermodynamic perspective .",
    "in particular the temperatures achieved are so low that the third law of thermodynamics has to be considered .",
    "the discrete level heat pump can serve as a model to study the third law limitations .",
    "the finite time perspective of the third law is a statement on the asymptotic rate of cooling as the absolute temperature is approached .",
    "these restrictions are imposed on the optimal cooling rate .",
    "the behavior of the optimal cooling rate as the absolute temperature is approached is a third law upper bound on the cooling rate .",
    "the main finding of this paper is that the optimal cooling rate converges to zero linearly with temperature , and the entropy production reaches a constant when the cold bath temperature approaches absolute zero .",
    "heat engines and heat pumps are characterized by three attributes : the working medium , the cycle of operation , and the dynamics which govern the cycle .",
    "heat baths by definition are large enough so that their temperatures is constant during the cycle of operation .",
    "the heat engine and the heat pump are constructed from the same components and differ only by their cycle of operation .",
    "the working medium consists of an ideal ensemble of many non - interacting discrete level systems .",
    "specifically , the analysis is carried out on two - level systems ( tls ) but an ensemble of harmonic oscillators @xcite would lead to equivalent results .",
    "the tls systems are envisioned as spin-1/2 systems .",
    "the lack of spin - spin interactions enables the description of the energy exchange between the working medium and the surroundings in terms of a single tls .",
    "the state of the system is then defined by the average occupation probabilities @xmath0 and @xmath1 corresponding to the energies @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the energy gap between the two levels .",
    "the average energy per spin is given by @xmath5 the polarization , @xmath6 , is defined by @xmath7 and thus the energy can be written as @xmath8 .",
    "energy change of the working medium can occur either by population transfer from one level to the other ( changing s ) or by changing the energy gap between the two levels ( changing @xmath9 ) . hence @xmath10 population transfer is the microscopic realization of heat exchange .",
    "the energy change due to external field variation is associated with work .",
