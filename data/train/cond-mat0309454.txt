    "the study of simple dynamical models describing various features of dna dynamics has interested many authors for almost 20 years @xcite .",
    "this vivid interest arises of course from the biological relevance of dna but also from its physical properties which can now be probed through single - molecule micromanipulation experiments like stress - induced transitions @xcite or strand separation @xcite .",
    "this series of studies has clearly pointed out that dna must be considered as a dynamical object , whose ( nonlinear ) distortions could play a major role in its functions .",
    "one feature of dna that attracted a lot of attention from physicists is its thermal denaturation , i.e.  the transition from the native double - helix b - dna to its melted form where the two strands spontaneously separate upon heating @xcite , because it provides an example of a _ one - dimensional phase transition .",
    "_ experiments show that this transition is very sharp , which suggested that it could be first order and this led to numerous investigations , first to justify the existence of a transition in a one - dimensional system and second to determine its order @xcite . in spite of these efforts",
    "the nature of the transition is still unclear and moreover , as discussed below , the determination of its `` true '' order from experiments may turn out to be virtually impossible .    in the theoretical approaches",
    ", the level of complexity is reduced to the minimum by taking into account only the ( classical ) motion of large subunits rather than the full ( quantum ) many - body dynamics of all the atoms .",
    "clearly , an appropriate choice of the relevant degrees of freedom , depending on the specific problem at hand , is crucial .",
    "models based on the theory of polymers use self - avoiding walks to describe the two strands @xcite",
    ". they can be very successful in studying the properties of the melting transition at the largest scale but , as they do not describe dna at the level of the base pairs , they can not be used to investigate properties that depend on the sequence , or probe dna at a microscopic scale such as some recent single - molecule experiments .",
    "one of the simplest models that investigates dna at the scale of a base pair is the peyrard - bishop ( pb ) model @xcite .",
    "the complex double - stranded molecule is described by postulating some simple effective interaction among the bases within a pair and along the strands .",
    "the model has been successfully applied to analyze experiments on the melting of short dna chains @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it allows to easily include the effect of heterogeneities @xcite yielding a sharp staircase structure of the melting curve ( number of open base pairs as a function of the temperature @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "beyond its original motivation to explain the denaturation transition , the pb model has an intrinsic theoretical interest as one of the simplest one - dimensional systems displaying a genuine phase transition @xcite .",
    "the pb model has however a serious shortcoming because it does not take into account the helicoidal structure of dna . in the following , we consider an extended version of the pb model that has been proposed to avoid this weakness @xcite .",
    "the introduction of dna geometry induces an important coupling between base pair opening and helical twist , largely substantiated for real dna @xcite .",
    "a modified version of this helicoidal model has also been successfully applied to describe the denaturation of the chain induced either thermally or mechanically by applying an external torque to the chain ends @xcite .",
    "furthermore , its nonlinear excitations have been studied : small amplitude breather - like solutions have been analytically determined @xcite as well as large localized bubbles @xcite . both types of excitations are of interest as they may be thermally excited as precursors for the dna strand separation .",
    "a first effect of the helicoidal structure , namely to bring close to each other bases which are not consecutive in the sequence , was treated in @xcite , by introducing an interaction between these bases .",
    "this first approach however did not take into account the important geometrical effect that we want to examine here , the coupling between opening and twist .",
    "the aim of this work is to give further insight on the melting transition of the helicoidal model , both from the statistical and from the dynamical point of view . after having recalled the model and its state variables ( sections [ sec : model ] and [ sec : qualitative ] ) , the first part ( sections [ sec : transferint ] and [ sec : md ] ) is devoted to its exact thermodynamics and to a simulation study of its statistical properties .",
    "we find that the melting transition is extremely sharp , bearing essentially all of the hallmarks of a first - order transition , at all temperature sampling steps studied ( down to 0.01  k ) .",
    "however , a study of the model s `` universality class '' , using finite - size scaling techniques , allowing some variation of the relevant physical parameters , and drawing from analogies with a schrdinger - like equation ( appendix a ) , strongly suggests the presence of an `` underlying '' continuous transition of the kosterlitz - thouless type in the absence of nonlinear stacking .",
    "this should be contrasted with the exact second - order transition obtained in the zero - stacking limit of the pb model @xcite .    in the second part ( section [ sec : dynamics ] )",
    "we investigate dynamical structure factors that are of particular relevance to both neutron @xcite and raman @xcite scattering experiments .",
    "the underlying idea is that , upon approaching the transition , the molecule should display precursor effects in the form of a `` mode softening '' , i.e.  a slowing - down of the dynamics with appearance of a low - frequency component in the spectrum .",
    "slowing effects have been , to some extent , observed in the structure factors of the pb model @xcite thus encouraging this type of investigation .",
    "two versions of the model have been proposed in earlier studies .",
    "the first one @xcite describes an elastic backbone and fixed base - pair planes while the second @xcite considers a rigid backbone and moving base - pair planes .",
    "the two models display a very similar behavior with respect to denaturation as the potentials associated to the base - base interactions in a pair and along the strands are the same in both cases , and because both introduce a coupling between opening and twist that results from the helicoidal geometry . in the following",
    ", we will consider the fixed - planes model , sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .        the helical structure of dna is introduced essentially by the competition between a stacking interaction that tends to keep the base - pairs close to each other ( given by the fixed distance @xmath1 between the base planes ) and the length @xmath2 of the backbone segment ( described as an elastic rod of rest length @xmath3 ) that connects the attachment points of the bases along each strand .",
    "the ratio @xmath4 fixes the strand slant and therefore the resulting helicity of the structure .",
    "this helicity is accounted for by the angle of rotation of a base - pair with respect to the previous one , namely the _ equilibrium twist angle _ @xmath5 , equal to @xmath6 in b - dna at room temperature .    in the model ,",
    "bases are described as point - like particles of equal masses @xmath7 joined by elastic rods along each strand .",
    "bases lying on the same plane are coupled by hydrogen bonds leading to an attractive force that tends to maintain their equilibrium distance equal to the dna diameter @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the two bases in each pair move symmetrically . to describe base - pair opening and helical torsion under those constraints",
    ", it suffices to introduce two degrees of freedom per base - pair : these are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , i.e.  the radial and angular positions and of the @xmath11th base .",
    "the total number of degrees of freedom is thus @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the total number of base pairs .",
    "the restriction imposed by the assumption of a symmetric motion preserves the essential feature of the helical structure , the coupling between torsion and opening , while it keeps the model sufficiently simple to allow an _",
    "exact _ treatment of its thermodynamics .",
    "we consider the lagrangian @xcite @xmath14 - 1\\big)^2 \\nonumber \\\\          & - & k \\sum_n ( l_{n , n-1 } - \\ell_0)^2                   \\nonumber \\\\          & - & s \\sum_n ( r_n - r_{n-1})^2 \\exp[-b ( r_n + r_{n-1 } -2r_0)]\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the equilibrium and the actual distance between the two bases @xmath17 and @xmath18 along a strand , @xmath19 for later purposes , it is convenient to introduce the local twist angle defined as @xmath20 .",
    "the first term in the lagrangian is the kinetic energy .",
    "the second term is intended to describe the hydrogen bond interaction between the two bases in a pair . following refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , a simple morse potential form is chosen .",
    "the quadratic term in @xmath21 represents the elastic energy of the backbone rods between neighboring base - pairs on each strand . finally , the last term models a stacking interaction between neighboring base pairs .",
    "its effect is to decrease the stiffness of the open parts of the chain relatively to the closed ones and to stabilize the latter with respect to the denaturation of a single base - pair .",
    "terms of this type increase the cooperative effects close to the melting transition @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we restrict our attention to a chain with free boundary conditions , which corresponds to the experimental situation when dna denaturation is studied in solution .",
    "however , the model described above can be easily modified to account for an external torque @xmath22 applied at the base pairs at the two ends @xcite , as it is done in some single - molecule experiments .",
    "the geometrical parameters of the model can be straightforwardly fixed according to the available structural data @xcite .",
    "much more delicate is instead the choice of the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 gauging the effective forces .",
    "we selected values similar to those previously considered for the fixed - planes case , which have been discussed elsewhere : the choice of the @xmath24 parameter can be independently derived @xcite from the twist persistence length @xcite , while the choice of the other two parameters was based @xcite on a comparison with recent mechanical denaturation experiments @xcite . in particular , the important parameter @xmath25 which sets the main energy scale , has been tuned to reproduce as closely as possible the experimental value of the denaturation temperature @xmath26 .",
    "the full set of parameters used in the following are summarized in table  [ parameters ] .",
    ".the parameter set used throughout the paper [ cols=\"<,^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     an even more sizable central component appears when closed and open form coexist ( see fig .",
    "[ spcoex ] ) .",
    "this is accompanied by a stronger coupling between angular and radial degrees of freedom , as manifested by the peaks at acoustic frequencies in @xmath27 .",
    "the birth of large low - frequency components bears strong resemblance with heterophase fluctuations observed in other lattice models with ( pseudo ) first - order transition characterized by large entropy barriers @xcite .",
    "in other words , the motion of the interface between the two phases should be responsible of the slow dynamics .    to close this section",
    ", it is worth mentioning that a related analysis of collective modes for the helicoidal model has been recently reported @xcite .",
    "the analytical calculations were performed at room - temperature and are based on the instantaneous normal - modes . at variance with our simulations , this approach describe the short - time dynamics ( on a time scale of picoseconds ) and a direct comparison is therefore not straightforward .",
    "the study of a simplified model of dna has proved to be extremely fruitful to unveil the basic features of the melting transition at the single  molecule level . from the theoretical point of view , dealing with a one - dimensional model ( with two degrees of freedom per base pair ) turned out to be particularly convenient as it allows an exact evaluation of the partition function .",
    "indeed , the angular variables can be eliminated by fourier transform , yielding a more tractable one - variable transfer integral problem .",
    "the latter can not be solved analytically but the numerical and approximate results presented above provide a complete insight on the nature of the transition . in particular , the finite - size scaling analysis of the transfer integral turned out to be essential to take into account the finiteness of the integration range .",
    "such an analysis strongly suggests that the underlying transition is continuous , of the kosterlitz - thouless type .",
    "this behavior can be related to the existence of an effective attractive force which is _ directly connected to the helicoidal geometry _ because it appears when the angular degree of freedom is integrated out .",
    "qualitatively it can be understood as coming from the difficulty to disentangle the two helices . on the other hand , for physically relevant values of the parameters , the temperature range over which the continuous aspect of the transition can be detected",
    "may become extremely narrow ( less than @xmath28  k ) .",
    "for all practical purposes the transition appears to be perfectly sharp , and bears the hallmarks of a first order transition , in agreement with experiments . in our view , this result is remarkable and attracts the attention on how numerical or experimental observations on finite systems and with a limited resolution may dramatically differ from theoretical expectations .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations confirm this apparent first - order character .",
    "they show hysteresis and metastability as well as a coexistence region between an open and a closed `` phase '' and , by varying the energy density in the critical region , a gradual change of the volume fraction occupied by the two which is reminiscent of , say , the liquid  gas transitions .",
    "in addition to the very sharp transition found by the theoretical analysis , the finite  size effects certainly play a major role in the above phenomenology .",
    "the helicoidal model is more sensitive to these finite size effects than the `` flat '' pb model because the free ends allow a release of the torsional energy which appears when a segment of the chain opens .",
    "one can understand the crucial role of boundary effects if one considers that a finite closed loop of helicoidal dna can not denaturate at all because the two strands are entangled .",
    "the dynamics of the transition , as probed by the calculation of the radial and angular structure factors , shows some prominent features such as the existence of a central peak that is presumably due to the slow motion of the denaturation bubbles .",
    "moreover , the coupling between opening and twist introduces some additional spectral features that would deserve further investigations .",
    "another point that should be reconsidered is the nucleation of denaturation bubbles .",
    "the phenomenology described at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : md ] is , at least qualitatively , very much reminiscent of the nucleation mechanisms that drives relaxation from metastable states at ordinary first - order transitions @xcite .",
    "for instance , simulation in the overheated state suggest the existence of a  critical size \" of the denaturation loops above which they become unstable .",
    "hence , metastability stems from the fact that small enough bubbles close relatively fast .",
    "nevertheless , there are important differences that one should keep in mind .",
    "indeed , in classical nucleation theory the key role is played by the surface tension term ( proportional to the square of the droplet s radius ) , whereby in our one - dimensional case the bubble `` surface '' is independent of its length .",
    "the correspondence with the usual theory is probably due to the torsional energy , associated to the opening , which grows with the bubble size .",
    "this suggests that a `` one - dimensional nucleation theory '' could be developed for helicoidal dna .",
    "the present study has focused on a dna model that describes the molecule at the scale of the base pair .",
    "we think that it is relevant because it is the scale of the genetic code at which phenomena related to biological functions occur .",
    "the helicoidal geometry itself is at this scale ( or more precisely at the scale of a few tens of base pairs ) . on the other hand , there are other phenomena that enter in the statistics of dna melting , and they are related to the behavior of the molecule at a much larger scale , on which the strands are regarded as flexible strings .",
    "recent studies have shown that the entropy of the loops also contribute to lead to a first order transition , provided that self avoiding aspects betwen segments of the loop and between open regions and closed domains are properly taken into account @xcite .",
    "our approach is complementary to these studies and shows that the observed sharp melting transition of dna may have multiple origins .",
    "in the absence of an external torque , the nontrivial part of the partition function of the model is given by @xmath29^{1/2 }   d\\theta _ { n } \\right\\ } e^{-v\\left ( \\ { r_{i},\\theta _ { i }   \\ } \\right ) /k_{b}t }   \\quad , \\label{ztot}\\ ] ] where the potential energy consists of the three last terms in ( [ lagrangian ] ) , and the relative angle coordinate enters only via the second term . introducing sum and difference coordinates @xmath30 , @xmath31 , it is possible to write the integral over @xmath32 as @xmath33 for the parameter values given in table  [ parameters ] , and @xmath34  k , the dimensionless ratio @xmath35 is equal to @xmath36 ; this allows us to use the leading - order low - temperature asymptotic expansion @xmath37 where @xmath38   , over the whole temperature range of interest .",
    "note that due to the repulsive core of the morse potential , the inequality @xmath39 always holds .",
    "furthermore , numerical evaluation reveals that the function @xmath40 is ( i ) almost independent of @xmath41 , and ( ii ) weakly dependent on temperature ( cf .",
    "[ fig : omapprox ] ) . in the following",
    "we will use the temperature - independent approximation @xmath42 which misses the weak peak near @xmath43 , but reproduces correctly the second moment , which is central to what follows .      within the approximations ( [ eq :",
    "phi0 ] ) , ( [ eq : rineq ] ) , the partition function is dominated , in the thermodynamic limit , by the largest eigenvalue of the one - dimensional ti equation @xmath48 with @xmath49 where @xmath50\\right)^2 $ ] and @xmath51 $ ] .    the form of @xmath52 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : omapprox ] and/or eq .",
    "[ eq : omapproxg ] ) establishes that , in addition to the ranges @xmath53 , @xmath54 of the morse and stacking interactions , respectively , there is a third , much larger , characteristic length in the problem , @xmath55 .",
    "depending on the strength of the various parameters , it may be possible to further simplify the general one - dimensional ti problem and elucidate the ensuing critical behavior .",
    "two distinct cases will be considered below .",
    "a gradient expansion of ( [ 1dti ] ) involves : ( i ) introducing @xmath56 ( ii ) changing the variable of integration from @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) to @xmath59 , and ( iii ) performing the gaussian integrals over @xmath59 . noting that ( a ) the combined effect of the stacking interaction and the gaussian approximation ( [ eq : omapproxg ] ) can be described in terms of the quantity @xmath60 ( note that @xmath61 can be interpreted as an effective nearest neighbor harmonic spring constant ) and that ( b ) @xmath62 to second order in @xmath59 everywhere in ( [ apprkern ] ) , one obtains @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 ; here , @xmath66 is a long - range attraction which comes from in exponentiating the term in the first parentheses of ( [ apprkern ] ) , and @xmath67 $ ] is a thermally generated barrier analogous to the one described in @xcite in the context of the one - dimensional dna model with stacking . expanding the exponential in the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : intermode ] ) and rearranging terms , one obtains @xmath68 where @xmath69   \\label{eq : ulrtot}\\ ] ] is attractive everywhere .",
    "( [ eq : sl ] ) is a key result .",
    "it can be trivially cast in standard sturm - liouville form with a density function proportional to @xmath70 ; the @xmath46 dependence of @xmath71 is crucial for obtaining quantitatively sensible results ; the simultaneous presence of three terms in the potential energy prevents us from solving ( [ eq : sl ] ) exactly .",
    "a numerical solution @xcite for the parameter values of table ( [ parameters ] ) reveals a behavior very similar to the full ti solution of section [ sec : transferint ] . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : e0e1ode ] , the two lowest eigenvalues exhibit an almost perfect intersection at a temperature sampling @xmath72  k. in addition , the differential equation turns out to be an excellent approximation to the original ti .",
    "thus , the estimated @xmath73  k is only a few percent higher than the value obtained within the ti ; other critical thermodynamic quantities of interest demonstrate comparable , or better agreement , e.g. the transition enthalpy @xmath74  ev ( cf .",
    "0.133  ev from ti ) , or the jump in the specific heat , @xmath75 ( cf .",
    "@xmath76 from ti ) .",
    "the apparent first - order transition has its origin in the fact that the thermally generated barrier has a substantially longer range than the morse potential .",
    "the analysis of section [ sec : transferint ] suggests that crossover to a continuous transition eventually occurs ; however , for the values of the parameters relevant to dna denaturation , observing this exponential crossover would require a temperature resolution of better than 1  mk .",
    "this estimate can be made by studying crossover phenomena with exactly solvable `` toy models''@xcite of the denaturation transition of the linear pb variety , where the zero stacking limit is known to yield a second - order `` underlying '' transition . in the case of ( [ eq : sl ] )",
    ", the presence of an attractive inverse square interaction raises the possibility of more complex behavior , i.e. confinement at all temperatures or crossover to another transition at much higher temperatures .",
    "this is discussed below .      in the limit",
    "@xmath78 , the decay of the kernel ( [ apprkern ] ) is governed by ( [ eq : omapproxg ] ) .",
    "this reduces ( [ eq : sl ] ) to @xmath79 where @xmath80 in the absence of stacking , the system is subject to the morse potential and the long - range attraction ( [ eq : u_0st ] ) ; the point to note is that the attractive force is linearly dependent on the temperature , just as the coefficient of the 2nd derivative in ( [ eq : sl0st ] ) ; consequently , if @xmath81 , the system will either have a bound state or not , according to the value of the coefficient in the denominator of ( [ eq : u_0st ] ) .",
    "the value 16 is marginal ; if the interaction had been stronger , one would have confinement at all temperatures ; the morse potential , being of short range , could not change that ; in other words , one would obtain a near - transition at a temperature controlled by the morse potential , but then the long - range attraction would prevent dissociation at all temperatures .",
    "we have verified this by numerically solving ( [ eq : sl0st ] ) . for weaker attractions ( value of the coefficient 16 or higher in these units )",
    ", numerical work suggests that the transition becomes higher than second order ; however , numerical accuracy is not sufficient to determine the detailed behavior .",
    "it is possible to guess what happens by substitutng the morse potential by a narrow well , i.e. the total potential in ( [ eq : sl0st ] ) being equal to @xmath82 for @xmath83 and equal ( [ eq : u_0st ] ) for larger @xmath46 ; this case is exactly solvable and shows that although the shift in the value of the critical point is less than 1 % , the nature of the transition is radically transformed : the vanishing of the lowest eigenvalue is now of the kosterlitz - thouless type @xmath84    we thank franco bagnoli , simona cocco , thierry dauxois and stefano ruffo for useful discussions .",
