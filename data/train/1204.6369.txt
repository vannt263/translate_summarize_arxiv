    "molecular electronic devices have been intensively studied for the past decade , having been regarded as candidates to replace silicon - based electronic devices . since aviram and ratner proposed the concept of the first molecular rectifier in 1974@xcite , a variety of molecular devices have been suggested . in addition , thanks to advancement in experimental fabrication and measurement techniques , electronic currents through molecules have been experimentally measured and investigated @xcite . despite these efforts , there are still many issues in the practical realization of molecular electronic devices .",
    "understanding interactions between conducting electrons and molecular vibrations is one of the key issues to address for future applications .",
    "vibrational excitations due to the scattering of conducting electrons can change molecular configurations and attachment geometries , affecting the functionality and performance of the molecule - based devices or in turn backscatter electrons , impeding flow.the worst scenario is that local heating effects might ultimately break down the junction .",
    "vibration - induced inelastic transport has been theoretically investigated following two directions .",
    "the first one is to study simple model hamiltonians , e.g. a single electronic level coupled to a single phonon mode , which is known as the anderson - holstein model@xcite .",
    "based on this simplified model , many novel and interesting transport properties have been predicted and investigated .",
    "however , the model used in this approach is too simplified to provide detailed and accurate theoretical data that quantitatively explain experimental results .",
    "on the other hand , a quantitative and computational approach based on density functional theory ( dft ) offers the chance to describe a realistic system accurately without any adjustable parameters@xcite .",
    "in particular , using dft one can calculate equilibrium geometries , electronic couplings , normal modes , and electron - vibration interactions .",
    "transport theories can then be combined with dft , and several approaches have been proposed@xcite . in particular , a non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) formulation , in combination with dft , and commonly called dft - negf , has been widely used in ab initio quantum transport problems@xcite . this approach is more powerful than other methods in that it can tackle not just the emergence of electron - vibration interactions , but any other type of interactions .",
    "dft - negf has been successfully applied to elastic quantum transport for both zero - bias@xcite and finite - bias cases@xcite , and recently it has been extended to include interaction effects like electron - vibration interactions@xcite .",
    "dft - negf requires to use an atomic - like localized basis , because the device should be spatially divided into two electrodes and a molecular conductor . for this reason",
    "most of dft - negf calculation packages have been implemented using localized basis set .",
    "however , from a computational viewpoint , it is known that a planewave - based dft calculation can provide an accurate description of electronic states systematically , and in particular can describe electronic states which have considerable spread in vacuum , where localized orbitals are absent .",
    "furthermore , while basis functions used in localized - basis calculations are determined depending on types of atoms and the chemistry of the system , a planewave basis can describe any given system without making any further assumption",
    ".    however , periodic - boundary conditions planewave calculations are not suitable to dft - negf calculations . for this , maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwf ) , as proposed by marzari and vanderbilt@xcite , provide the formal and algorithmic formulation for a transformaton between delocalized and localized orbitals . since the wannier transformation is an exact unitary mapping , one can construct a minimal set of atomic - like localized functions within an energy window of interest without losing the accuray of planewave - based dft calculations , and a mlwf approach to quantum transport has been very successfully applied to zero - bias quantum conductance calculations@xcite . the next step to develop a mlwf approach to quantum transport@xcite",
    "is to include interaction effects on transport properties . in this paper",
    "we focus on extending mlwf - based ab initio quantum transport calculations to investigate electron - vibration interaction effects on molecular junctions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[section2 ] we review first - principles electronic structure calculations , especially focusing on ( 1 ) density - functional perturbation theory to calculate vibrational properties and electron - vibrational interaction , and ( 2 ) the transformation of electron - vibration interactions from a plane - wave basis to a maximally localized wannier function basis . in sec.[section3 ] a quantum transport theory based on non - equilibrium green s functions and diagrammatic perturbation theory is presented .",
    "first we discuss electrode - conductor - electrode system partitioning and the calculation of lead self - energies .",
    "then we review diagrammatic expansion schemes for electron - vibration interactions in the self - consistent born approximation and lowest - order perturbation theory .",
    "inelastic transport properties such as finite - bias electronic current and power transfer are calculated within the meir - wingreen transport formalism@xcite .",
    "finally we present a semi - classical rate equation to determine nonequilibrium vibrational populations in the presence of interactions with conducting electrons and coupling to bulk vibrations in the electrodes . in sec.[section4 ]",
    "application results and further analysis are presented .",
    "the electronic structure of a given system is calculated within the dft framework .",

    "note that these equations should be self - consistently solved since the equations that determine @xmath14 depends on the linear response in the charge density @xmath13 .",
    "the vibrational frequencies @xmath19 of the system can be calculated by solving the following eigenvalue equation : @xmath20    the electron - vibration interaction can be written in a second quantized form as follows@xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the electron creation ( annhilation ) operator for bloch state @xmath24 .",
    "similarly @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is the creation ( annhilation ) operator for the phonon of the vibrational mode @xmath27 with the energy @xmath28 at wave vector @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the electron - phonon coupling matrix element .",
    "once the linear response of the charge density is computed from dfpt , the electron - phonon coupling matrix can be calculated from the derivative of the self - consistent kohn - sham potential @xmath31 as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath34th kohn - sham orbital wavefunction at wavevector @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the response of the self - consistent kohn - sham potential with respect to the phonon mode @xmath27 at wavevector @xmath29 .",
    "because we use a large supercell that contains a conducting molecule and two electrodes , @xmath37-point sampling can be used safely .",
    "thus , by dropping wavevector indices for electrons and vibrations , the interaction hamiltonian can be written in the simpler form : @xmath38 where @xmath39      as discussed in the introduction , dft calculations based on a planewave basis can provide a very accurate description on the electronic structure of the system , in particular in comparison with a localized basis set .",
    "however , since bloch orbitals are intrinsically delocalized , they are not suitable to quantum transport calculation based on green s functions , in which spatial seperation between electrodes and the conductor is required in the hamiltonian description . in this work",
    "maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwfs)@xcite are used in order to transform bloch wavefunctions into localized functions .",

    "@xcite .    using eq.([wannier_rotation ] ) and",
    "eq.([disentanglement ] ) , one can readily obtain the electronic hamiltonian and electron - vibration interaction hamiltonian in the mlwf basis .",
    "in particular , we provide an explicit transformation of hamiltonian from the bloch representation to wannier one for the @xmath37-point sampling case , which is used in large supercell calculations . under the wannier transformation ,",

    "the device region consists of a vibrating molecule and some of the bulk electrode relaxed surface layers.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    a two - terminal system can be divided into three parts : the left electrode ( l ) , the central region ( c ) , and the right electrode ( r ) .",
    "the central region is defined as the region that contains the molecules , defects , or nanoscale conductors of interest . with a localized orbitals basis",

    "this can be achieved by including some surface atoms of the electrodes into the central region and defining them as an _ extended molecule_. for the elastic quantum conductance calculation this condition is sufficient to select the device region .",
    "however , in dft - negf it is assumed that the conducting electrons are scattered by the molecular vibrations only in the device region , while the electrons in the electrodes are treated as noninteracting quasi - particles .",
    "therefore the central region should be large enough to guarantee that the electron - vibration interactions converge to zero outside it .",

    "@xmath61 should be replaced by the overlap matrix . however , since mlwfs are orthonormal by construction , we can safely use the identity . up to now",

    "while most of the decay rates are of the order of @xmath190 to @xmath191 @xmath189 , there are few modes with much smaller rates .",
    "these small decay rates can arise for two reasons .",
    "first , as seen in fig.[decaying_rate_localization ] ( a ) , decay rates start to increase significantly from the @xmath192th mode on .",
    "these vibrational modes ( between @xmath192 and @xmath184 ) have energies higher than the highest @xmath0 cnt phonon energy . recalling that decay processes based on the harmonic coupling essentially correspond to _ one vibration to one phonon _",
    "transitions , there are no bulk phonons to which the vibrational modes lying outside the band width of bulk phonons can transfer their vibrational energies . once the _ anharmonic _ coupling that makes _ one vibration to multi - phonons _",
    "transition possible is taken into account , these modes may have larger decay rates .",
    "however , this correction is beyond our work .",
    "second , notice that among the vibrational modes whose energies lie inside the bulk phonon dispersions , some of them still have small decay rates .",
    "most of them correspond to vibrations that are localized inside the benzene molecule , or to _ wagging _ motions of the surface hydrogen atoms .",
    "because these motions are spatially well separated from bulk phonons , one may expect that they are less coupled to bulk phonons . in order to measure how localized these modes are inside the molecule",

    "this happens thanks to the same chemical character between hydrocarbons and carbon - based electrodes .",
    "if we were to consider organic molecules attached to a metal electrode such as gold or platinum , the large mass difference between atoms in the molecule and those in the electrode would make most of the molecular modes lie outside the electrode phonon dispersions .",

    "( [ rateeq2 ] ) , ( [ eq : absorption_rate ] ) and ( [ eq : emission_rate ] ) , we can calculate nonequilibrium vibrational populations .",
    "vibrational occupations will start to increase as the bias voltage exceeds their corresponding threshold voltages . while in the vicinity of the threshold voltage the vibrational populations increase linearly",
    ", nonlinear effects can appear at higher bias voltages . for low - energy modes vibrational",
    "populations monotonically increase with the bias ; however , non - monotomic populations are observed for some of the high - energy modes .",
    "these trends are shown in fig.[cnt33-c6h4.noneq.phonons ] , where vibrational populations for some of the highly excitable modes are illustrated .",
    "mode @xmath197 , which is low - energy , shows a monotonically increasing behavior .",
    "for the other high - energy modes , their populations increase , then decrease in a certain bias voltage range , and then start to increase again .",
    "one can hint at a qualitative explanation for this cooling behavior examining the local density of states in the device region , as recently reported in ref.@xcite . as observed in fig.[cnt33-c6h4.dos]-(a ) , there is one resonant peak located at a energy higher than @xmath199 , which is the common fermi level before the bias is applied .",

    "red and blue lines indicate absorption and emission processes respectively . for",
    "a very small bias none of the electron can access the resonant peak , as seen in fig.[cnt33-c6h4.dos]-(b)-(1 ) .",
    "when the bias increases , the absorption process using the resonant peak starts to take place , but the electrons participating in the emission process can not reach the resonance ( see fig.[cnt33-c6h4.dos]-(b)-(2 ) ) .",
    "therefore the absorption rate @xmath200 becomes enhanced , so it may lead to a decrease in vibrational populations . for higher biases such that the resonant peak is located between the left and right chemical potentials , the emission process using resonance is activated , leading to enhanced emission rates , as shown in fig.[cnt33-c6h4.dos]-(b)-(3 ) .",
    "when the bias increases more , another resonant emission process becomes possible , as shown in fig.[cnt33-c6h4.dos]-(b)-(4 ) , while the resonant absorption process at which the electrons are reflected back to the left lead is prohibited due to pauli blocking . as a result ,",
    "the emission rate becomes more enhanced in comparison to the absorption one , and vibrational populations may increase again in this bias range . as an illustratative example , fig.[cnt33-c6h4.absorption.emission.rate ] ( b ) shows the absorption and emission rates for mode @xmath198 .",
    "one can clearly observe that the bias voltages for which the absorption and emission rates get enhanced are different : the slope of the absorption rate curve first increases around @xmath201 , but then decreases at @xmath202 .",
    "by contrast , the emission rate linearly increases up to @xmath203 , and at a bias larger than @xmath203 its slope also increases .",
    "difference between bias voltages at which absorption and emission rates become enhanced results in the observed cooling behavior in the intermediate bias range .    for low - energy modes whose energies are much smaller than the broadening of the resonant peak",
    ", the intermediate cooling regime may not appear distinctly .",
    "for example , see in fig .",
    "[ cnt33-c6h4.absorption.emission.rate]-(a ) the absorption and emission rates for mode @xmath197 . unlike mode @xmath198 ,",
    "the absorption and emission rates show quite similar dependence on the bias voltage , implying that a cooling behavior is not observed .",
    "last , not every high - energy mode goes necessarily through a cooling down phase , since vibrational populations are determined by the interplay of absorption , emission , and decay rates .",
    "when the decay rate @xmath103 is larger than the difference between the absorption and emission rates @xmath204 , the steady state solution can be approximated as @xmath205 in this case , the dependence of the vibrational population on the bias voltage becomes similar to that of the emission rate , and the cooling behavior does not appear .    finally , we would like to stress the importance of mass ratios between the conducting molecule and electrodes . as pointed out above",
    ", since the band width of bulk phonons in the electrodes gets narrower as the atomic mass of electrodes increases , a molecular junction connected to electrodes consisting of heavier atoms will have less opportunities to thermalize . to demonstrate this mass ratio effect",
    ", we calculate the total vibrational energy stored in the vibrating region by increasing the mass of the atoms in the carbon electrode to be e.g. silicon or germanium . as shown in fig.[cnt33-c6h4.mass.ratio ] , the junction with a larger mass ratio has more vibrational energy , and higher probability to break down due to heating effects .",
    "in this work we have described an _ ab initio _ quantum transport approach based on maximally localized wannier functions to calculate inelastic transport properties in the presence of electron - vibration interactions . in our implementation calculations",
    "are performed using the plane - wave dft code quantum - espresso , and wannier90 for the transformation into mlwf and the construction of the hamiltonian in the wannier basis .",
    "inelastic transport properties such as differential conductance and non - equilibrium vibrational occupations have been calculated within the meir - wingreen transport formalism based on negf .",
    "in particular , the electron - vibration self - energy is computed using either the scba or the lopt .",
    "we have tested our implementation applying it to carbon - based molecular junctions : a benzene molecule connected to cumulene chains and a @xmath0 cnt - benzene-@xmath0 cnt junction .    in the first system",
    "we have found the differential conductance change at bias voltages corresponding to the vibrational energies of active modes .",
    "using multi - eigenchannel analysis based on scattering theory , we have identified that out - of - plane and in - plane vibrational motions lead to conductance jumps and drops respectively .",
    "this analysis on the simultaneous occurrence of conductance jumps and drops is consistent with recently reported calculation@xcite .    in the second application , where cumulene wires are replaced by realistic cnt electrodes",
    ", we have focused on the decay rates of molecular vibrations and non - equilibrium vibrational populations .",
    "small decay rates can be rationalized examining the band width of bulk phonons that molecular vibration can resonantly access , and the localization of molecular vibrations . also , we have argued that a larger mass ratio between the conducting molecule and electrodes can enhance local heating and ultimately lead to the junction break down .",
    "thus organic molecular junctions connected to carbon - based electrodes or lighter metals may be more stable in comparison to heavy - metal electrodes ( of course , strength of the anchoring chemical bonds will also play a role ) .",
    "we have also observed that nonequilibrium vibrational occupations for high - energy modes can be cooled down in an intermediate bias regime , which may be understood in terms of a resonant state in the device region .",
    "this observation agrees well with resonant cooling reported in other first - principle calculations@xcite .    these applications and detailed analysis , in a very good agreement with other first - principle studies performed with a local orbital basis set , confirm that our _ ab initio _ approach to inelastic transport with plane - wave basis and wannier functions could be applied to other realistic nanoscale junctions .",
