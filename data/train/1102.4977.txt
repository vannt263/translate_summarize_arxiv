    "heterostructures of aluminium nitride ( aln ) and gallium nitride ( gan ) are key material systems for novel optoelectronic devices.@xcite the large band offset @xmath2 and direct - band gap permits intersubband transitions in the near - infrared,@xcite which makes them attractive for building devices working at fiberoptic wavelengths .",
    "they hold the promise to extend the operational regime of quantum cascade ( qc ) lasers both in the near and the far - infrared.@xcite the latter due to the large lo - phonon energy @xmath3 . for wurtzite aln / gan structures grown in the c - plane direction ,",

    "the full curve shows the carrier density , while the dashed lines indicate the background doping density.,width=302 ]    aln / gan intersubband devices offer great opportunities , but challenges remain both for growth and design .",
    "interface roughness,@xcite high dislocation density , and scarcity of high - quality substrates limit device performance",
    ". moreover , precise control of multiple quantum levels and efficient transport through the structure demand ultrathin aln layers .",
    "this demand arise because the large band offset and heavy conduction electron mass @xmath4 weakens the coupling between states in adjacent quantum wells .",
    "the wide depletion regions and two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) forming at the two sides of an active region,@xcite exacerbates this challenge for devices based on perpendicular quantum transport .",
    "for instance , in resonant - tunneling diodes and qc lasers , the depletion regions make it difficult to simultaneously obtain efficient current injection and control over the alignment of levels and transitions in the structure .",
    "presently , current - driven devices are mostly limited to resonant - tunneling diodes , often exhibiting large hysteresis.@xcite a related issue exist for structures operating at zero bias ( like absorption structures ) , especially those of few layers : as electrons accumulate in the 2deg , the active region is depleted.@xcite    to tackle some of the design problems , we here introduce the two related concepts of polarization balance and polarization - balanced design .",
    "a structure is _ polarization balanced _ when the unscreened field vanish in the cladding layers ( buffer and cap ) layers .",
    "we will denote these regions as leads if the structure is intended for perpendicular transport . by unscreened we mean the field that arise from the polarization - induced interface charges @xmath5 and from the applied bias @xmath6 including dielectric screening by valence electrons , but excluding screening by conduction electrons and donors .",
    "the concept is similar in spirit to strain balance.@xcite the electrical fields in the leads ( cladding layers ) generally bring about depletion and inversion regions outside the active region . since the band tailing in the depletion region impedes electron transport , polarization balance helps enable efficient injection into the central active structure .",
    "nonpolar structures are always polarization balanced at zero bias",
    ". many polar structures are polarization balanced at a certain bias .",
    "_ polarization - balanced designs _ are structures tailored to operate at a bias @xmath7 resulting in polarization balance . in this study",
    ", we rely on alloyed leads to retain a large design freedom for polarization - balanced designs .",
    "a few observations substantiated in this paper clarify the concept and highlight opportunities of such designs .",
    "first , these designs can , at a desired operational bias @xmath8 , provide flat - bands in the injection region and in the leads in general .",
    "there is no depletion barrier .",
    "second , polarization balance at @xmath9 is also possible by using a suitable choice of composition in the cladding layers . in this case",
    ", charge accumulates within the active region .",
    "third , if charge accumulates in the active region  which can also happen for a finite bias , for instance ( in a quasi - static picture ) , when the lowest level of the active region falls close to or below the fermi level  polarization balance does not result in flat bands .",
    "fourth , a polar device can be operated for a bias before , at , or beyond polarization balance , that is @xmath10 , or @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 . rather than the applied bias @xmath6 for convenience",
    ": using the standard convention for @xmath14-axis , we always consider an applied bias @xmath6 which is non - positive and a particle current going right - to - left . ]",
    "fifth , nonpolar structures can not operate before , and typically has to operate much beyond the bias resulting in polarization balance .",
    "sixth , since in polar structures , current - driven devices such as quantum - cascade lasers can operate at the bias giving polarization balance , with ensuing flat bands in the injection region , good injection can be ensured without the need of tailoring graded digital alloys in the transport region .",
    "@xcite    our calculations of conduction - band profile and quantum states presented here are based on the schrdinger - poisson ( sp ) equation@xcite in the effective - mass , envelope - function approximation , including non - parabolicity and exchange - correlation effects as described in ref .  .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the second section motivates polarization - balanced designs .",
    "we illustrate the formation of depletion and inversion regions for an aln / gan heterostructure ; we demonstrate that the depletion barrier seriously inhibit perpendicular current ; and finally , we take a trial - and - error approach to polarization balance for aln / gan double - barrier structures with algan leads of varying alloy concentrations . in the third section , we develop theory to guide polarization - balanced designs .",
    "for an active region consisting of aln and gan layers strained to al@xmath15ga@xmath16n leads , a simple relation between intrinsic voltage drop , alloy concentration @xmath17 , and average al composition @xmath18 in the active region is developed .",
    "the fourth section contains some simple applications : we first demonstrate that choosing a polarization - balance design for an unbiased structure secures good electron filling in the active regions ; we then turn to a large parameter - space study of a two - level quantum cascade structure .",
    "we find that the use of algan instead of gan leads , significantly enlarge the freedom for realizing polarization - balanced designs .",
    "the final sections hold our discussions , prospects , and conclusions .",
    "that depletion regions form outside the active regions in polar heterostructures is well known.@xcite we here observe that these have a huge impact upon the function and transport properties of aln / gan heterostructures . by calculating the conduction - band profile of a double barrier",
    "we first illustrate the formation of such a depletion barrier .",
    "then , by calculating the perpendicular current through a single aln barrier having gan leads , which allows for a simple and transparent analysis , we make evident how severely this barrier inhibits current injection .",
    "finally , we bring to view how using algan leads rather than gan shortens or even removes these depletion regions .",
    "such an approach opens the possibility of avoiding the depletion regions without needing huge biases that may prohibit realistic device design .",
    "this result motivates our theory developments and sp calculations in later sections .",
    "interface charges arise at the boundary between different layers of polar heterostructures as follows : @xmath19 the conduction band profile produced by these charges exhibit a characteristic sawtooth - like shape for a layered heterostructure . @xcite if the lead composition and lattice constant is the same on both sides of the active region , so that @xmath20 , the polar contributions to the electrical field vanish in the leads because the net charge produced by the polarization - induced charge in the active structure is zero : @xmath21 .",
    "the intrinsic voltage drop over the active structure , arising from the polarization - induced charges @xmath22 , does not , in general , vanish . for a structure in equilibrium @xmath23",
    "some mechanism must compensate for this potential drop , so that the fermi level can remain constant throughout the structure . for a doped structure ,",
    "the electrical fields rearrange conduction electrons into an inversion ( accumulation ) region on one side of the structure , leaving behind a depletion ( space - charge ) region on the other .",
    "this charge transfer results in a potential drop that cancels the intrinsic voltage drop for a structure which is unbiased in equilibrium .",
    "if the screening by conduction electrons and ionized donors is so weak that the fermi - level falls close to the valence band  as for low donor concentration and large potential variations  valence electron may tunnel into the conduction band creating holes .",
    "hence such polarization - induced doping can also compensate for the intrinsic potential drop.@xcite in our study , the formation of depletion and inversion regions in the conduction band is the sole mechanism responsible for securing equilibrium .",
    "figure  [ fig : first ] illustrates the formation of depletion and inversion regions for an unbiased double barrier structure , with aln barriers , and gan well and cladding layers .",
    "the conduction - band profile ( upper panel ) and electron density ( lower panel ) are obtained in a schrdinger - poisson calculation.@xcite we use hard wall boundary conditions far outside the active region ( boundaries not displayed ) so that a proper bulk develops within the cladding layers .",
    "the lower panel shows that as electrons accumulate on the left , a wide depletion region forms ( @xmath24 nm ) on the right .",
    "the upper panel shows that the resulting band profile exhibits band bending in the inversion and depletion regions , and the characteristic sawtooth shape in the active part .",
    "the ground state of the quantum well lies far above ( @xmath25 ) the fermi level ( dotted lines ) .",
    "in contrast , the energy level of the 2deg falls below the fermi level . in this inversion region ,",
    "several quantised states exist , but electrons accumulate mostly in the 2deg of lowest energy .",
    "@xcite the dashed lines indicate the conduction - band profile for an undoped structure for some arbitrary boundary condition . the central role played by the inversion and depletion regions for this simple",
    "heterostructure underlines the importance of considering the long - range screening as part of a device design .",
    "the wide depletion barriers seriously reduce tunneling current through a heterostructure . a qualitative wkb ( wentzel - kramers - brillouin ) analysis serves as an illustration .",
    "the wkb tunneling probability is as follows : @xmath26 here @xmath27 identifies the classically forbidden regions and the angle brackets , an average over the forbidden region .",
    "@xmath28 is the potential energy , @xmath29 , the energy , and @xmath30 , the effective electron mass .",
    "the tunneling current is given by the tsu - esaki formula:@xcite @xmath31\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath6 is large , a typical operational condition for aln / gan structures , electrons are not pauli blocked ( which enters through the support function @xmath32 and fermi level @xmath33 ) . the tunneling current is then roughly proportional to the tunneling probability .",
    "we make two observations : the heavy mass and large band offset of aln / gan reduce the tunneling probability compared to many other materials . and",
    ", a long classically forbidden region reduces the tunneling probability more than a high barrier does . in eq .",
    "[ eq : tunnprob ] the term in the exponential increases linearly with the length , while the square root dampens the dependency on the barrier height .",
    "thus , the barrier in the depletion region , which is typically of a wide spatial dimension , but of low energy , has a significant current - impeding effect .",
    "the current - voltage curve for a single aln barrier with gan leads is here calculated using a transmission coeffient obtained with a transfer - matrix method for arbitrary barrier shapes,@xcite and the current @xmath34 with the tsu - esaki equation of eq .",
    "[ eq : tsu_esaki ] .",
    "this calculation further corroborates the wkb argument and attest the extreme current sensitivity to the depletion layer width .",
    "the aln barrier is 1.0 nm wide ( two monolayers ) . a positive background charge density of @xmath35 accounts for doping of the gan leads . the conduction - band profile @xmath36 is obtained in an effective - mass schrdinger - poisson description.@xcite a stepped fermi - level induces the non - equilibrium charge - density distribution",
    "the dashed lines identifies the stepped effective fermi - level.,width=302 ]    figure  [ fig : singlebarrier ] displays the current - voltage curves for the barrier structure , calculated for conduction - band profiles obtained with and without the polar effects .",
    "the current increases enormously with bias until about @xmath38 , for which the current in the polar case exceeds that of the nonpolar case ( which does not exhibit this extreme sensitivity ) .",
    "the extreme bias sensitivity has also been documented in refs   and  .",
    "the two lower insets show the conduction - band profiles in the polar case for two sample voltages .",
    "it shows that for a voltage of @xmath39v there is a wide depletion region , while for @xmath40 voltage , the band is almost flat , with traces of an inversion region influencing the right side .",
    "it is evident that the reduction in sensitivity coincides with achieving flat bands in the leads .",
    "the voltage drop arising from the polarization fields is @xmath41 .",
    "thus , for an applied bias of @xmath42 the unscreened fields vanish , as the applied bias match the voltage drop over the barrier region . for the single barrier , the conduction band in the lead region , as obtained in the sp calculation , is approximately flat when the applied bias match the intrinsic voltage drop . where the single barrier in a polar heterostructure represents an elementary case of polarization balance , a nonpolar heterostructure is the trivial case ;",
    "polarization - balance is achieved at zero bias .",
    "the upper inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : singlebarrier ] shows that , in the nonpolar case , the depletion and inversion regions that arise at nonzero bias do not inhibit current as the direction of the slope coincides with the movement of the electrons.@xcite          having studied a single barrier , we next study the conduction - band profile of double barrier structures which is arguable the simplest structures that exhibits an internal quantum structure within the active region .",
    "its intended functionality is electroluminescence ; the electron tunnel resonantly into the upper level of the quantum well , possibly make a transition to the lower level , and exit by tunnelling into the continuum .",
    "this toy structure allows us to exemplify design features of complex structures .",
    "the few parameters involved in its specification also permit brute - force trend studies , such as that presented in section 4 .    in designing many different structures , we found that a typical feature for aln / gan structures with gan leads was that the bias required to overcome the depletion barriers , and thus get good transport conditions , was so large that it resulted in poor confinement of the upper level , and very hot electrons in the ejection lead .",
    "the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:3series ] illustrates these issues for a double - barrier structure .",
    "it displays the result of a schrdinger - poisson calculation for different applied biases , under the assumption of efficient emptying of the active region ; the active region and the left lead have the same fermi level . in the cases displayed in panels",
    "a1) and a2) , a depletion barrier hinders electron injection . in panel a3) ,",
    "the bias is large enough to give flat bands in the leads , and also within the quantum well . in this case ,",
    "states in the injection lead resonate with the upper level of the active region .",
    "these energy levels match because the aln layer is appropriately thin for a gan well of this width . in polar heterostuctures ,",
    "the energy levels depend strongly on the barrier widths , because of the typically large potential drops across the barrier .",
    "the a3) structure exhibits troublesome features ; the potential of the left barrier is so low that electrons easily escape prior to making a transition , and since the electron is confined in the triangular part of the barrier , increasing the well width does not help .",
    "that the electrons leaving the structure are hot can also be a problem . for periodic structures such as qc lasers",
    ", electrons may never relax before reaching the next period .",
    "it is also inefficient from a power - usage perspective .",
    "using algan leads with a finite al concentration @xmath43 , instead of gan leads , reduces the potential drop over the active structure at high - transport resonant - tunneling conditions since the unscrened field arise from the difference in polarization between the layers .",
    "as the quantum transition happens mostly within the active structure , the alloy scattering introduced should not severely broaden this peak .",
    "the middle and right panels , bx) and cx) , of fig .",
    "[ fig:3series ] show band profiles calculated for alloyed leads .",
    "the b1) panel shows that for zero bias and @xmath44 , the depletion region is much reduced compared to @xmath45 in a1). by increasing the bias , as shown b2 panel , the band in the leads eventually becomes flat , requiring only about half the bias as with gan leads as shown in a3). the b2) structure confines the upper level much better than if the leads consist of gan , and the electrons tunneling out of the structure remain fairly cold .",
    "thus , it outperforms a3). both b2) and a3) are polarization - balanced designs ; they operate close to the flat - band condition .",
    "the c1) structure highlights another important effect : here , the energy of the lower level of the active region falls below the conduction band edge of the leads .",
    "this results in large band filling , with ensuing depletion regions on both sides of the barrier .",
    "note that for the c2) and c3) structures , our assumptions about a stepped the fermi level might be inappropriate .",
    "we include the structure for the purpose of illustration and completeness .",
    "we find that for this particular active structure , the use of al@xmath46ga@xmath46n leads [ right panels / cx) ] prohibits flat band in the leads irregardless of applied bias .",
    "the conduction - band profiles of fig .",
    "[ fig:3series ] demonstrate that we can remove the depletion barrier at , and above , a certain bias , and that this bias is lowered by using alloyed leads , unless electron accumulate within the active structure",
    ". since flat band benefits electron injection , designing structures to operate at this bias is an excellent starting point for making current - driven devices where high power is essential .",
    "a strategy is therefore to restrict the design space to those structures which are polarization balanced .",
    "the next section develops theory for conditions that ensures an automatic restriction to such polarization - balanced designs .",
    "the voltage drop over a heterostructure arising from polar effects is found by solving poisson s equation .",

    "polarization balance is obtained when it equals the applied bias @xmath54 .",
    "this condition generally requires that the two lead compositions are the same ; otherwise , interface charges does not cancel out , and the unscreened fields can not vanish in the lead region .",
    "if the active region is fully or partially relaxed , the lead regions on both sides should be defined so that they have the same lattice constant , and thereby piezoelectric contributions .       and @xmath55 as a function of the alloy concentration of an al@xmath56ga@xmath57n layer , as given by eq .",

    "much charge accumulates within the active region [ c1),c2) ] as the fermi - level was above the lowest level of the active region .",
    "the structure showed in _ fig .",
    "[ fig : tails ] _ was designed for polarization balance at zero bias according to the theory developed in section 3 .",
    "this secures excellent charge accumulation in the active region .",
    "[ fig : phases ] _ displayed key results of numerous structures at a bias giving polarization balance . in _ fig .",
    "[ fig : overview ] _ all these results scatter along the curve indicating polarization balance .",
    "some of the designs resulted in filling of the active region ( placing them within the gray region ) and are therefore among the failed designs .",
    "the purpose of the dashed circles is to indicate ( in an abstract sense ) successful polarization - balanced designs according to the selected design criteria .",
    "the placement of the results of the single barrier displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : singlebarrier ] are not shown here .",
    "we note that since the single barrier does not have any internal structure , accumulation within the active structure does not occur .",
    "a single barrier can not be designed for polarization balance at zero bias .",
    "the nonpolar case is always polarization - balanced at zero bias , but for such structures , polarization balance does not guarantee charge accumulation within the active region .      the theory developed for polarization balance may be useful for designing structures not intended as polarization - balanced designs , since it can also be used to identify the flat - band condition .",
    "designing a device to operate at an applied bias larger than that resulting in polarization balance may be advantages for some purposes .",
    "for instance , to ensure an accumulation layers in the injection lead , making its operation more like that of a nonpolar structure.@xcite nevertheless , if an effective continuum should arise in the injection region , the bias across it should be small , to avoid the formation of a stark - ladder.@xcite    the huge strain in the structures considered in this study might render them unsuitable for actual applications , although there are numerous of attempts of making resonant - tunneling diodes using gan leads which have even larger strains.@xcite using algainn layers could be helpful , but complicates growth . with this additonal freedom , one could design structures that are both polarization and strain balanced.@xcite only in special accidental cases can one fulfil both these criteria using layers within the same class of binary alloys ( such as algan )",
    ".    lattice matching by using alinn barriers and gainn wells@xcite removes strain completely . however , with only two different alloy compositions of the layers the generic polarization balance approach is impossible , since it in general requires layers of at least three different compositions .",
    "we therefore mention that polarization balance concepts can also be developed for leads that are superlattices .",
    "such an approach is in the spirit of digital alloys .",
    "it would allow for structures that are both polarization balanced and lattice - matched ( or the more relaxed strain - balance condition ) , for instance by combining al@xmath108in@xmath109n and gan.@xcite since strain is zero , we only balance the spontaneous part of the polarization .    aside from presenting a solution to the current inhibiting effect of band tailing in the depletion region , polarization - balanced designs present an additional advantage : the shape of the conduction band does not depend on inversion and depletion regions .",
    "this has the consequence that the conduction - band profile essentially decouples from the specific doping and carrier concentration .",
    "this reduces the importance of an exact control over the donor density for the functionality of a device , which is also helpful since the number of ionized donors is complicated to calculate in heterostructures , or when the binding energy is similar to the thermal energy.@xcite we note that in our quasi - static study , effects like charge trapping and formation of field domains@xcite are not included , and these could complicate design considerations .    for emission structures of short optical wavelength , and in particular for qc lasers made up of an alternating series of optically active and interjecting current injections regions , the possibility to directly engineer zero - bias conditions in the injection region ( or in the leads ) points to an additional strong advantage of polar heterostructures with polarization - balanced designs .",
    "in contrast to conventional nonpolar structures , it is not necessary to grade the injection layers to compensate for the field . a large applied bias does not inevitably result in a large electrical fields in the leads or , for that sake , in all of the active ( transport - limiting ) region . in a good design ,",
    "the potential drop can be engineered to occur primarily in the region where the optical transition takes place .",
    "we conjecture that this advantage can result in a significant simplification of the tailoring of the quantum wells and barriers that ensures efficient injection in devices like qc lasers .",
    "the polarization balance concept represents a guiding principle for robust designs of wurtzite aln / gan heterostructures grown in the c - direction . for high - power current - driven devices , it helps eliminate the depletion barrier impeding the perpendicular current .",
    "it also simplifies design since one can , to a larger extent , focus on the active structure .",
    "this is because the influence of the doping levels on the conduction - band profile is substantially reduced as the conduction band is flat in the leads .",
    "furthermore , the flat bands in the leads makes grading of injection regions in qc lasers unnecessary . for such designs of unbiased structures",
    "it instead secures a large electron population in the active region .",
    "our study has been restricted to algan , since the large mass and band offset accentuates the current inhibiting effect of the depletion regions .",
    "however , the concept naturally generalize , not only to nitrides@xcite including inn and bn and their alloys , but also to heterostructures of other polar materials such as znmgo / zno.@xcite",
