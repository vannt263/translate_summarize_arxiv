    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath3 ) has proved to be a very suitable instrument to implement the basic dynamics and symmetries of the meson meson and meson baryon interaction @xcite at low energies .",
    "the essence of the perturbative technique , however , precludes the possibility of tackling problems where resonances appear , hence limiting tremendously the realm of applicability .",
    "the method that we expose leads naturally to low lying resonances and allows one to face many problems so far intractable within @xmath3 .",
    "the method incorporates new elements : 1 ) unitarity is implemented exactly ; 2 ) it can deal with the allowed coupled channels formed by pairs of particles from the octets of stable pseudoscalar mesons and ( @xmath4 ) baryons ; 3 ) a chiral expansion in powers of the external four - momentum of the lightest pseudoscalars is done for re @xmath5 , instead of the @xmath6 matrix itself which is the case in standard @xmath7 .    within this scheme , and expanding @xmath8 up order @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the @xmath11 amplitude , one obtains the matrix relation in coupled channels @xmath12^{-1 } t_2 , \\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the usual @xmath9 amplitude in @xmath3 .",
    "once this point is reached one has several options to proceed in decreasing order of complexity :    \\a ) a full calculation of @xmath13 within the same renormalization scheme as in @xmath3 can be done .",
    "the eight @xmath14 coefficients from @xmath15 are then fitted to the existing meson meson data on phase shifts and inelasticities up to 1.2 gev , where 4 meson states are still unimportant .",
    "this procedure has been carried out in @xcite in the cases where the complete @xmath9 amplitude has been calculated .",
    "the resulting @xmath14 parameters are compatible with those used in @xmath3 . at low energies the @xmath9 expansion for @xmath6 of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is identical to that in @xmath3 .",
    "however , at higher energies the nonperturbative structure of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , which implements unitarity exactly , allows one to extend the information contained in the chiral lagrangians to much higher energy than in ordinary @xmath16 pt , which is up to about @xmath17 mev .",
    "indeed it reproduces the resonances present in the l = 0 , 1 partial waves .",
    "\\b ) a technically simpler and equally successful additional approximation is generated by ignoring the crossed channel loops and tadpoles and reabsorbing them in the @xmath14 coefficients given the weak structure of these terms in the physical region .",
    "the fit to the data with the new @xmath18 coefficients reproduces the whole meson meson sector , with the position , widths and partial decay widths of the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 resonances in good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "a cut off regularization is used in @xcite for the loops in the s - channel .",
    "c ) for the l = 0 sector ( also in l = 0 , s = @xmath24 in the meson baryon interaction ) a further technical simplification is possible . in these cases it is possible to choose the cut off such that , @xmath25 where g is the loop function of two meson propagators .",
    "this is possible in those cases because of the predominant role played by the unitarization of the lowest order @xmath3 amplitude , which by itself leads to the low lying resonances , and because other genuine qcd resonances appear at higher energies .    in such a case and given the fact that @xmath26 , eq .",
    "( 1 ) becomes @xmath27^{-1 } \\,t_2 = [ 1 - t_2 \\,g]^{-1}\\ , t_2 \\rightarrow t = t_2    + t_2 \\,g \\,t,$ ] which is a bethe - salpeter equation with @xmath10 and @xmath6 factorized on shell outside the loop integral , with @xmath10 playing the role of the potential .",
    "this option has proved to be successful in the l = 0 meson meson sector in @xcite and in the l = 0 , s = @xmath24 meson baryon sector in @xcite .    in the meson baryon sector with s = 0 , given the disparity of the masses in the coupled channels @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , the simple `` one cut off approach '' is not possible . in @xcite",
    "higher order lagrangians are introduced while in @xcite different subtraction constants in g are incorporated in each of the former channels leading in both cases to acceptable solutions when compared with the data",
    ".    an alternative , related procedure to eq .",
    "( [ iam ] ) , is developed in @xcite using the @xmath32 method and allowing the contribution of preexisting mesons which remain in the limit of large @xmath33 .",
    "this procedure allows one to separate the physical mesons into preexisting ones , mostly @xmath34 pairs and the others which come as resonances of the meson meson scattering due to unitarization .",
    "using the option c ) , a good description of interaction of the @xmath35 is coupled channels interaction is obtained in terms of the lowest order lagrangian and the bethe salpeter equation with a single cut off .",
    "one of the interesting features of the approach is the dynamical generation of the @xmath36 resonance just below the @xmath35 threshold .",
    "the threshold behavior of the @xmath35 amplitude is thus very much tied to the properties of this resonance .",
    "modifications of these properties in a nuclear medium can substantially alter the @xmath35 and @xmath37 nucleus interaction and experiments looking for these properties are most welcome .    in a recent paper @xcite we propose the @xmath38 reaction as a means to study the resonance , together with the @xmath39 reaction to see the modification of its properties in nuclei .",
    "the @xmath36 is seen in its decay products in the @xmath40 channel , but as shown in @xcite the sum of the cross sections for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 production has the shape of the resonance @xmath36 in the i = 0 channel .",
    "hence , the detection of the @xmath44 in the elementary reaction , looking at @xmath45 ( @xmath46 being the invariant mass of the meson baryon system which can be obtained from the @xmath44 momentum ) , is sufficient to get a clear @xmath47 signal . in fig .",
    "1 we show the cross sections predicted for the @xmath0 reaction looking at @xmath48 , @xmath44 @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( alone ) .",
    "all of them have approximately the same shape and strength given the fact that the i = 1 contribution is rather small .",
    "the momentum chosen for the @xmath37 is 500 mev / c which makes it suitable of experimentation at kek and others facilities .",
    "since the @xmath52(1535 ) resonance is also obtained via the bethe - salpeter equation ( see fig .",
    "2 ) in the meson baryon @xmath53 sector with the channels @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , one can automatically generate the series implicit in fig .",
    "3 which provides the coupling of a @xmath54 or an @xmath2 to the resonance , the latter being generated at both sides of the external mesonic vertex .",
    "all vertices needed for the calculation can be obtained from standard chiral lagrangians . the results",
    "which we obtain are @xcite @xmath55    the result for the @xmath54 coupling rule out the mirror assignment in chiral models where the nucleon and the @xmath56 form a parity doublet @xcite in analogy with the linear @xmath57 model .",
    "we have reported on the unitary approach to meson meson and meson baryon interactions using chiral lagrangians , which has proved to be an efficient method to extend the information on chiral symmetry breaking to higher energies where @xmath3 can not be used .",
    "this new approach has opened the doors to the investigation of many new problems so far intractable with @xmath3 and a few examples have been reported here .",
    "we have applied these techniques to the @xmath0 reaction and the evaluation of the @xmath58 couplings .",
    "the experimental implementation of the former reaction and others on photoproduction of scalar mesons and of the @xmath36 , reported elsewhere @xcite , will provide new tests of these emerging pictures implementing chiral symmetry and unitarity . similarly , the techniques used to evaluate the @xmath59 couplings can be easily extended to evaluate electromagnetic properties of low lying resonances which are generated within the unitary scheme .",
