    "experiments at the b factories are reaching an accuracy level that requires a good understanding of radiative effects in weak b decays .",
    "in particular , real photon emission distorts the spectra of other decay products , therefore directly affecting the distribution of kinematic quantities used to select and count signal events  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "real photon emission indirectly affects branching fraction measurements , leading to systematic shifts of the order of a few percent .",
    "while radiative effects are well studied in semileptonic and nonleptonic kaon decays , where chiral perturbation theory is applicable over the entire kinematical range ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the situation is less satisfactory in b decays . here",
    "the large energy release generally prohibits the application of chiral perturbation theory methods over large parts of the phase space , and one has to resort to different theoretical tools .",

    "the measured branching fractions of this mode are @xcite @xmath6 which contribute to the world average @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the hadronic dynamics of the radiative semileptonic decays is complicated by the presence of many energy scales . however , in certain kinematical regions a model independent treatment is possible . in the limit of a soft photon , low s theorem @xcite fixes the terms of order @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the expansion of the decay amplitude in powers of the photon momentum @xmath10 .",
    "these contributions have been computed in @xcite in kaon semileptonic radiative decays @xmath11 .",
    "higher order terms in @xmath10 have been more recently obtained using chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "a similar approach is possible in b decays with the help of the heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory @xcite , as long as the pion and photon are sufficiently soft .",
    "this is the case in a limited corner of the phase space , corresponding to a large dilepton invariant mass @xmath12 .",
    "the radiative semileptonic decay @xmath13 at low @xmath14 produces in general either an energetic pion or an energetic photon ( see fig .  1 ) . in this paper",
    "we use soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite-@xcite methods to prove a factorization relation for the decay amplitude _ in the kinematical region with an energetic photon and a soft pion_. this can be written schematically as @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 . here",
