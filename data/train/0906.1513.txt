    "at present , more than 150 different inter- and circumstellar molecules have been observed in space .",
    "the chemical diversity is striking , and both simple and very complex as well as stable and transient species have been detected . among these unambiguously identified species polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules ( pahs ) are lacking even though pahs are generally thought to be ubiquitous in space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "strong infrared emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.2 @xmath3 m are common in regions of , for example , massive star formation and have been explained by pah emission upon electronic excitation by vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) radiation .",
    "consequently , pahs are expected to play a key role in the heating of neutral gas through the photoelectric effect .",
    "pahs are also considered as important charge carriers inside dense molecular clouds , and relevant for molecule formation through ionmolecule interactions @xcite . nevertheless , the only aromatic species unambiguously identified in space is benzene , following infrared observations @xcite .    in recent years",
    "electronic transitions of pah cations have been studied in the gas phase with the goal to link laboratory data to unidentified optical absorption features observed through diffuse interstellar clouds . following matrix isolation spectroscopic work @xcite , gas phase optical spectra",
    "have been recorded for several pah cations @xcite by combining sensitive spectroscopic techniques and special plasma expansions @xcite .",
    "such optical spectra have unique features and therefore provide a powerful tool for identifying pahs in space .",
    "so far , however , no overlap has been found between laboratory spectra of gaseous pahs@xmath1 and astronomical features .",
    "in dense molecular clouds , most pahs should quickly condense onto the h@xmath4o rich icy grain mantles , quenching the ir emission process . here , they will participate in ice grain chemistry .",
    "more than 25 years of dedicated studies , mainly in the infrared , have proven that a direct comparison between laboratory and astronomical ice spectra paints an accurate picture of the composition and the presence of inter- and circumstellar ices , even though solid - state features are rather broad . the spectral features ( band position , band width ( fwhm ) and the intensity ratio of fundamental vibrations ) depend strongly on mixing ratio and ice matrix conditions and this provides a sensitive analytical tool to identify ice compositions in space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the past",
    ", several experiments have been reported in which the formation of new molecules was proven upon vuv irradiation of astronomical ice mixtures , typically under high vacuum conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many of these studies were not _ in - situ , _",
    "i.e. _ , reactants were determined after warm up of the ice , and although vuv - induced photochemistry at low temperatures is expected to take place , it is not possible to fully exclude that at least some of the observed reactants may have been formed during the warm - up stage .",
    "more recently , _ in - situ studies have become possible using ultra high vacuum setups in which ices are grown with monolayer precision and reactions are monitored using reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption .",
    "recent results show that h - atom bombardment of co and o@xmath0 ice results in the efficient formation of h@xmath0co / ch@xmath5oh and h@xmath0o@xmath0/h@xmath0o , respectively @xcite .",
    "overall , such studies are still restricted to the formation of rather small species , with ethanol as the most complex molecule investigated in this way @xcite . moreover",
    ", the reactants and products should not have overlapping bands in order to track them separately . _ _    in the present work , a new approach is presented that extends our previous ftir work on interstellar ice analogues to the uv / vis . with the new setup it is possible to record , _ in - situ , the vuv photochemistry of pahs and pah derivatives in water ice at 10  k in real time . in the next section , this new approach",
    "is discussed in detail .",
    "the first results for the pah pyrene ( c@xmath6h@xmath7 , or py ) and its photoproducts , pyrene cation ( c@xmath6h@xmath8 , or py@xmath1 ) , hydroxypyrene ( pyoh ) , hydroxypyrene cation ( pyoh@xmath9 ) , and pyrene / pyrenolate anion ( py@xmath10/pyo@xmath10 ) in h@xmath4o ice are presented in section  [ spectroscopicassignment ] .",
    "finally , the astrophysical relevance of this work is discussed in section  [ astrophysicalimplications ] .",
    "the latter is twofold .",
    "first , time - dependent results of vuv irradiated ice provide general insight into possible reaction pathways upon photoprocessing of pah containing water ice .",
    "second , the results provide a spectroscopic alternative to search for pah and pah - related optical features in the inter- and circumstellar medium ( ism / csm ) through electronic solid - state absorptions . _",
    "a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the experiment consists of three units : a vacuum chamber in which the ice is grown , a special vuv irradiation source that is used for the photo - processing of the ice and a source emitting broadband light that is focused into the ice and subsequently detected using a monochromator equipped with a sensitive ccd camera .",
    "the vacuum chamber consists of an iso-160 6-cross piece .",
    "a 300  l  s@xmath11 turbomolecular pump , backed by a 10  m@xmath12  hr@xmath11 double stage rotary pump , is used to evacuate the chamber and to guarantee an operating pressure of @xmath1310@xmath14  mbar .",
    "a catalytic trap is mounted on the pre - vacuum pump to prevent pump oil from entering the vacuum chamber .",
    "the top flange of the cross piece holds a differentially pumped rotary flange on which is mounted a closed cycle helium refrigerator equipped with a cold finger .",
    "a mgf@xmath0 sample window with a diameter of 14 mm , clamped into an oxygen free copper holder between indium gaskets , is mounted on the cold finger and centered on the optical axis of the setup .",
    "this allows for rotation of the sample window through 360@xmath15 under vacuum .",
    "the sample window can be cooled down to 10 k and a thermocouple ( chromel - au / fe ( 0.07% ) ) and a temperature controller guarantee accurate temperature settings with 0.1  k precision .",
    "the py : h@xmath0o sample is prepared by vapor depositing pyrene from a solid sample ( aldrich 99% ) heated to 40@xmath15c , together with milli - q water vapor from a liquid sample .",
    "the entire inlet system is maintained at @xmath1640@xmath15c during deposition and comprises gas bulbs containing the sample material and tubing for directed deposition , approximately 15  mm from the sample window .",
    "the flow rate of the sample material is set by a high precision dosing valve .",
    "condensation inside the tube is prohibited by additional resistive heating and the temperature settings are monitored by k - type thermocouples .",
    "the resulting ice film thickness is accurately measured by recording the number of interference fringe maxima ( @xmath17 ) of a hene laser ( @xmath18 = 632.8  nm ) which strikes the sample window at an angle of @xmath19=45@xmath15 . to monitor film growth and thickness ,",
    "the intensity of the reflected laser light is measured with a sensitive photodiode .",
    "the ice thickness is subsequently determined by : @xmath20 with the refractive index of the predominantly h@xmath0o ice being @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] where both interference fringes produced during ice deposition and the simultaneous growth of the integrated neutral py absorbance band are shown .",
    "the final ice thickness amounts to 1.7  @xmath3 m and is reproducible to within 5% or better .",
    "simultaneously , the number of pyrene molecules in the ice sample ( @xmath22 ) is monitored by measuring the integrated absorbance of its strongest transition ( s@xmath0 @xmath23 s@xmath24 ) ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the number of pyrene molecules per @xmath25 can be calculated via @xcite : @xmath26[eqn1 ] where @xmath27 is the known oscillator strength of the s@xmath0 @xmath23 s@xmath24 transition of pyrene @xcite .",
    "the resulting column density of pyrene molecules amounts to about 4@xmath2810@xmath29  @xmath30 . for a typical sample with a thickness of 1.7  @xmath3 m",
    ", the column density of h@xmath0o molecules amounts to 4@xmath2810@xmath31  @xmath30 , using the value for the density of amorphous ice ( @xmath32=0.94  g/@xmath33 ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the sample is calculated to consist of a 1:10,000 pyrene : h@xmath0o mixture .",
    "this mixing ratio can be roughly varied by changing the h@xmath0o flowrate or the pyrene sample temperature .",
    "the hene beam used here for monitoring the ice growth process also traces other elements along the optical path and is used to align all components .",
    "the vacuum uv radiation from a special microwave ( mw ) powered hydrogen discharge lamp is used to simulate the interstellar radiation field @xcite .",
    "the lamp consists of a flow tube clamped in a mccarroll cavity @xcite and emits mainly ly-@xmath34 radiation around 121.6  nm and , with less intensity , a band centered around 160  nm .",
    "the cavity is excited by a regular mw power supply ( 100  w , 2450  mhz ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 pressure in the lamp is maintained at 0.4  mbar during operation ( praxair 5.0 h@xmath0 ) .",
    "this results in a vuv photon flux of @xmath1310@xmath35  photons  @xmath30  s@xmath11 .",
    "the lamp is centered onto the front flange and the vuv radiation enters the setup towards the ice sample through a mgf@xmath0 window that also serves as a vacuum seal .",
    "a shutter is used to block the vuv until the moment that the ice processing should start .",
    "besides eliminating the need to switch the h@xmath0 lamp on and off during the course of an experiment , this allows the lamp to stabilize before irradiation starts .",
    "this is important when tracking photochemical behavior during extended periods of photolysis .",
    "a 300  w ozone - free xe - arc lamp serves as a broad band white light source to measure the spectral ice features in direct absorption .",
    "the lamp has a spectral energy distribution that covers the full detector range ( 200  nm  @xmath36  2400  nm ) .",
    "alternatively , the light from a halogen fiber lamp can be used when no uv coverage is desired .",
    "an optical system consisting of lenses and diaphragms is used to guide the light beam through a mgf@xmath0 window along the optical axiscoinciding with the pre - aligned hene beamand crossing the ice sample at a 45@xmath15 angle .",
    "light that is not absorbed exits the vacuum chamber through a second mgf@xmath0 window after which it is focused onto the entrance slit of an andor shamrock spectrometer .",
    "the spectrometer is equipped with two interchangeable turrets which holds four gratings in total ( 2400 , 1200 , 600 and 150  lines  mm@xmath11 ) , allowing for a trade - off between wavelength coverage and spectral resolution , depending on the experimental needs . since typical ice absorption bands",
    "exhibit a fwhm of 4 - 20  nm , most of the experiments are performed using the 600  lines  mm@xmath11 grating , resulting in an accessible wavelength range of @xmath13140  nm .",
    "the light is dispersed onto a very sensitive 1024@xmath28256 pixel ccd camera with 16-bit digitization .",
    "the resulting signal is read out in the vertical binning mode by a data acquisition computer .",
    "spectra are taken in absorbance mode ( @xmath37=-ln(@xmath38 ) ) with respect to a reference spectrum ( @xmath39 ) taken directly after depositing the sample .",
    "recording a single spectrum typically takes about 5  ms and spectra are generally co - added to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) . in a typical experiment more than 1000 individual spectra are recorded and are reduced using labview routines .",
    "data reduction consists of local linear baseline corrections , multiple gaussian fitting of absorption profiles and absorption band integration .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the 310 to 500  nm spectrum of a py : h@xmath0o ice at 10  k after 1200 s of _ in - situ photolysis in absorbance mode .",
    "the spectrum is baseline subtracted and given in optical depth ( od ) . since the spectrum recorded before vuv irradiation is taken as a reference ( @xmath40 ) , bands with positive od values arise from species produced by photolysis while the carriers of negative od bands decrease in density .",
    "it is noteworthy that s / n ratios are good even though the processes are studied in a very dilute mixture ( py : h@xmath0o @xmath131:10,000 ) .",
    "previous work was on more concentrated samples ( pah : h@xmath0o @xmath131:500 , @xcite ; pah : h@xmath0o @xmath131:800 to 1:3200 , @xcite ) .",
    "_    a gaussian fit to all of the features visible in the spectrum is indicated as well .",
    "clearly , a number of new species are produced at the expense of neutral pyrene .",
    "the peak positions , fwhm and assignments of all the bands in figure  [ fig3 ] are summarized in table  [ table1 ] , along with comparisons of earlier results found in other molecular environments .",
    "the assignments given in figure  [ fig3 ] were made as follows .",
    "based on previous studies of pyrene in rare gas matrices @xcite , the strong , negative band peaking at 334  nm is readily assigned to the @xmath41@xmath23@xmath42 electronic transition of neutral pyrene ( @xmath43@xmath23@xmath44 ) .",
    "similarly , the positive bands near 363 , 446 , and 490  nm are assigned as the strongest members of the pyrene cation @xmath45@xmath23@xmath46 , @xmath47@xmath23@xmath48 and @xmath45@xmath23@xmath48 vibronic transitions , respectively @xcite .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows that the bandwidth ( fwhm ) of the py@xmath1 bands is broader in the solid h@xmath0o than in rare gas matrices , in accordance with the stronger interactions within the h@xmath0o matrix network .",
    "similarly , larger shifts in peak position may be expected .",
    "in addition to the py@xmath1 bands , other new bands appear near 345 , 367 , 405 , and 453  nm . we ascribe these to hydroxypyrene ( pyoh ) , hydroxypyrene cation ( pyoh@xmath1 ) , and pyrene / pyrenolate anion ( py@xmath2/pyo@xmath2 ) based on the work of @xcite who reported the spectra of 1-hydroxypyrene and its daughter products in various media .",
    "the suggestion of anion production in these ices is noteworthy in view of the astronomical detection of negative ions both in the solid state @xcite and in the gas phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the appearance of clear bands due to pyoh , pyoh@xmath1 , and py@xmath2/pyo@xmath2 after vuv radiation at 10 k is somewhat surprising .",
    "previous optical studies of the vuv photolysis of three different pahs in h@xmath4o ice indicated that conversion of the parent neutral pah to the cation was the major , and apparently only , photolytic step and that the cation remained stabilized in the ice to remarkably high temperatures ( @xmath13100  k ) for long periods ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite further showed that , in the case of naphthalene ( nap ) , subsequent reactions between nap@xmath1 and the h@xmath4o matrix did indeed produce napoh , but only during warm - up ( @xmath13100  k ) . using mass spectroscopy",
    ", @xcite showed that pah oxides and hydroxides were part of the residues left _",
    "after vuv photolyzed pah / h@xmath0o ices were warmed under vacuum .",
    "furthermore , upon prolonged exposure , the vuv transmittance of the mgf@xmath0 hydrogen lamp window drops and with this the pyoh and pyoh@xmath1 production also decreases relative to the production of py@xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that photolytic processes within the pyrene containing water ice change , perhaps because water dissociation becomes less effective with reduced hard uv flux while direct py ionization still readily occurs with near uv photons @xcite .",
    "the influence of temperature and uv spectral energy distribution is currently under investigation . _",
    "to further investigate the spectroscopy and the photochemistry of vuv irradiated h@xmath4o -rich ices that contain pahs , time - dependent optical studies were performed . figure  [ fig4 ] shows the integrated od behavior of the py , py@xmath1 ( for two bands ) , and pyoh absorptions as function of photolysis time . during the first 130 s of vuv irradiation ,",
    "the py decay is clearly correlated with py@xmath1 growth .",
    "this allows us to determine relative band strengths of the two species by investigation of the short timescale correlation .",
    "the subsecond time response of the present setup is a prerequisite for this to work .",
    "we derive a band strength of @xmath49 cm  molecule@xmath11 for the @xmath50 py@xmath1 transition in h@xmath4o ice using equation  ( [ eqn1 ] ) . as other chemical processes",
    "become important , the correlation disappears .",
    "the loss of py slows significantly while the py@xmath1 starts a slow decline after the maximum is reached .",
    "the pyoh signal continues to grow slowly but steadily throughout the photolysis process and is most likely formed by py / py@xmath1 reacting with photoproducts of h@xmath0o .",
    "its formation is consistent with the recent outcome of a quantitative vuv photodesorption study of h@xmath0o ice under ultra high vacuum conditions , where a h+oh photodissociation channel was reported @xcite .",
    "a reaction network connecting all of these species is presented in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "in addition to py@xmath1 formation and reactivity during irradiation , we have also studied its stability within the ice when photolysis is stopped .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] plots the normalized integrated o.d . of the 445.6  nm py@xmath1 band as a function of time after vuv radiation is stopped .",
    "the figure spans 50  hr and shows that although the total py@xmath1 signal drops , 60% remains trapped in the ice after 2 days .",
    "the small wiggle at the 0.05 level is due to baseline variations .",
    "there are clearly two decay channels , one fast and one slow. the following expression is used to fit the experimental data : @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53",
    "hr , @xmath54 and @xmath55  hr .",
    "this produces the red curve in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the processes responsible for these two decay rates are not yet clear .",
    "the py@xmath1 decay may be governed by recombination with trapped electrons . in considering these results , it is important to keep in mind that the ice processes described here are recorded for one temperature ( 10  k ) and will most likely depend on temperature .",

    "water is by far the dominant component of interstellar ices .",
    "since pahs are considered to be widespread throughout the ism , they are likely to be frozen out wherever h@xmath0o - rich ices are present . the photochemical dynamics observed here and the new spectroscopic information make two astrophysical points .",
    "astrochemically , this work shows that the effective photolytic production of pah ions in pah containing ice upon vuv irradiation should not be neglected _ a priori _ when modelling interstellar ice chemistry .",
    "the behavior of the various species that is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] suggests that a new set of solid - state reactions appears when irradiating pah containing water ice .",
    "the present study is on a rather isolated ice systemtypical for this type of laboratory studycomprising py and h@xmath0o . in a more realistic interstellar sample , containing other constituents , such as co , co@xmath0 or nh@xmath5 , and other pahs , chemical pathways will become more complicated , but since water is the most dominant component in these extraterrestrial ices , we expect that the trends observed here will generally apply . another important point to note is that reactions involving ions are not included in any of the current astrochemical grain chemistry networks .",
    "the present study shows that positive ions can reside in the ice mantle for a substantial time .",
    "this is particularly interesting since an astronomical dust grain is a truly isolated system , whereas the laboratory analogue is grown on the tip of a cold finger .",
    "observationally , the spectroscopic results provide an alternative route to search for pah features in space .",
    "astrophysical searches to identify pahs and pah cations in the ism / csm have focused on vibrational and electronic transitions in the gas phase as well as solid - state pah features in the infrared .",
    "as stated previously , these searches have been largely unsuccessful .",
    "the infrared work suffers from spectral congestion and spectral overlap of vibrational modes .",
    "this prohibits an unambiguous identification of an emission feature to a specific carrier . in the uv / vis this",
    "is partly overcome as electronic excitations are unique for different pahs .",
    "however , electronic spectra of gas phase pahs showed no overlap with absorption features recorded through diffuse interstellar clouds , presumably of too low column densities @xcite .",
    "a different situation applies in the solid state ; pahs are refractory material and accumulate in time onto cold grains that offer a reservoir .",
    "therefore , the specific embedding of pahs in water ice as presented here provides an alternative starting point for an astronomical search .",
    "however , one has to realize that this idea has both pros and cons .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows that under the present experimental conditions the bands are rather broad .",
    "the fwhm of the py@xmath1 absorption feature at 445.6 nm is 66  . from an observational point of view",
    "this has the advantage that profiles can be studied at medium resolution , but also goes with the challenge to correct very accurately for possible background signals and in the end spectral overlaps may still exist , e.g. , with silicate or carbonaceous features .",
    "nevertheless , overlapping broad bands can contribute to the very broad structure ( vbs ) superposed on the interstellar extinction curve @xcite and simply may have been overlooked in the past .    as stated before",
    ", the electronic excitation energy is unique .",
    "this is good for selectivity , but bad for sensitivity , since spectral features of different pahs do not add up ( as in the infrared ) and consequently an individual optical band strength is , in principle , directly determined by the actual abundance of one specific pah in space .",
    "it is difficult , however , to predict the percentage of the total interstellar pah population that might exist in the form of one specific pah , e.g. , pyrene .",
    "nevertheless , electronic pah transitions are typically 2 - 3 orders of magnitude stronger than their ir bands and from this point of view , we expect that pah bands may be observable in the visible even though ir bands are barely discernible on the strong h@xmath4o bands @xcite .",
    "this is also reflected by the very good s / n ratios as visible in figure  [ fig2 ] for a very diluted mixture .",
    "we expect pahs to be sufficiently abundant in ices in regions of molecular clouds with a@xmath568 to permit detection in the optical .",
    "infrared ice bands have been detected along such lines of sight and the visible extinction is low enough to permit uv from the interstellar radiation field to process these ices .",
    "we have estimated the expected py and py@xmath1 absorption band strength towards an example source , mwc297 .",
    "this is an early - type b1.5v star with a well - characterized stellar spectrum , a @xmath57 magnitude of 14.34 and a 3.0  @xmath3 m ice band with @xmath58 . using the high sensitivity of an 8  m class telescope ( vlt )",
    "it is feasible to obtain , within a couple of hours , s /",
    "n @xmath161000 spectra of such a highly extincted source in the wavelength range under investigation . to estimate the expected od of a pyrene or pyrene cation ice absorption we use the standard relation : @xmath59 from @xcite . with @xmath60",
    "= 2.67 towards mwc297 @xcite this results in @xmath61 = 1.6@xmath2810@xmath62  @xmath30 . taking the total pah abundance in clouds with respect to @xmath63 to be @xmath133@xmath2810@xmath14 , this results in a total pah column density of 9.6@xmath2810@xmath35  @xmath30 . assuming that 1% of the total pahs in space is in the form of pyrene frozen out on grains and of this fraction up to 10% is in its singly ionized state ( py@xmath1 ) , the total column density of py@xmath1 or py toward mwc297 is estimated to range between 9.6@xmath2810@xmath64 and 8.64@xmath2810@xmath65  species/@xmath25 .",
    "the od is defined as @xmath66 with @xmath22 the column density of the absorbers , @xmath67 the integrated bandstrength and @xmath68 the fwhm . for a typical strong allowed vibronic transition , such as the @xmath41@xmath23@xmath69 py and @xmath47@xmath23@xmath46 py@xmath1 transitions , we take @xmath70  cm  molecule@xmath11 and @xmath71  cm  radical@xmath11 in ice with a fwhm=400 cm@xmath11 and 300  cm@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "this yields ods of @xmath73 for py and py@xmath1 , a range similar to that observed for ice bands .",
    "this work presents the first results of a spectroscopic and photo - chemical study of pyrene in water ice upon vuv irradiation under astronomical conditions . since the spectra are recorded in real time , it is possible to derive photochemical characteristics and to monitor a rich ion - mediated chemistry in the solid state .",
    "such processes are yet to be considered in astrochemical models .",
    "additionally , it is shown that the pyrene cations formed within the h@xmath0o ice by vuv irradiation remain trapped in the ice for an extended period .",
    "successive heating of the ice makes these ions available to diffusing species and hence should be considered in solid - state astrochemical processes .",
    "the new laboratory approach presented here offers a general way to provide astronomically relevant pah solid - state spectra .",
    "specifically , the spectra discussed here provide an alternative way to search for pyrene features in the ism / csm .",
    "the derived numbers show the potential of this method , but one has to realize , as pointed out before , that these numbers incorporate our limited knowledge on the actual pah quantities in space . for different pahs , with different abundances and different absorption strengths other numbers , both less and more favorable ,",
    "may be expected .",
    "furthermore , it is possiblein view of the rather effective way in which charged species form and stay in the icethat the actual abundance of ions may be higher .",

    "<S> a new experimental approach makes it possible to irradiate the sample with vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) light ( 7 - 10.5 ev ) while simultaneously recording spectra in the 240 - 1000 nm range with subsecond time resolution . </S>",
    "<S> both spectroscopic and dynamic information on vuv processed ices are obtained in this way . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a powerful tool to follow , _ in - situ and in real - time , the photophysical and photochemical processes induced by vuv irradiation of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon containing inter- and circumstellar ice analogue . results on the vuv photolysis of a prototype sample strongly diluted pyrene in h@xmath0o iceare presented . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the pyrene cation ( py@xmath1 ) , other productshydroxypyrene ( pyoh ) , possibly hydroxypyrene cation ( pyoh@xmath1 ) , and pyrene / pyrenolate anion ( py@xmath2/pyo@xmath2 ) are observed . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the charge remains localized in the ice , also after the vuv irradiation is stopped . </S>",
    "<S> the astrochemical implications and observational constraints are discussed . _ </S>"
