    "in contrast to the linear response at low temperatures @xmath15 ( sdh , qhe ) , the quantization affects joule heating in a significantly broader temperature range . at @xmath16",
    "the @xmath17 heating produces a multi - tiered electron distribution containing as many tiers as the number of landau levels inside the energy interval @xmath18 : @xmath19 .",
    "this quantal heating preserves the overall broadening ( @xmath20 ) of the electron distribution @xcite . surprisingly the electron distribution resulting from quantal heating is , in some respect , similar to the one created by quantum microwave pumping between landau levels@xcite .",

    "two - dimensional electron systems with multiple populated subbands exhibit additional quantum magnetoresistance oscillations@xcite .",
    "these magneto - inter - subband oscillations ( miso ) of the resistance are due to an alignment between landau levels from different subbands @xmath21 and @xmath22 with corresponding energies @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "resistance maxima occur at magnetic fields at which the gap between the bottoms of subbands , @xmath25 , equals a multiple of the landau level spacing , @xmath26 : @xmath27 , where @xmath5 is an integer @xcite . at this condition electron scattering on rigid impurities",
    "is enhanced due to the possibility of electron transitions between @xmath1 and @xmath2 subbands . at magnetic fields corresponding to the condition @xmath28 the intersubband",
    "electron transitions are suppressed . as a result , the resistance oscillations are periodic in inverse magnetic field due to this modulation of electron scattering .",

    "this paper presents investigations of miso in wide quantum wells with three populated subbands placed in a tilted magnetic field .",
    "studied systems contain conducting electrons localized near the edges of the quantum wells .",
    "the electrons , thus , form two parallel 2d systems separated by a distance @xmath29 . a weak electron tunneling between these two systems occurs through a relatively wide but shallow potential . in zero magnetic field",
    "the lateral ( along 2d systems ) and vertical ( between 2d systems ) motions of an electron are completely disentangled .",
    "the vertical tunneling uniformly splits the electron spectrum originally degenerate in the lateral directions .",
    "the resulting eigenvalues correspond to symmetric ( @xmath30 ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath31 ) configurations of electron wave functions in the vertical direction with the energy gap @xmath32 between two subbands independent of the lateral wave vector @xmath33 .",

    "we note also that in the regime of qhe the energy spectrum is often sensitive to effects of the electrostatic redistribution of 2d carriers between different subbands and quantum levels , which makes a quantitative comparison between different regimes challenging @xcite .",

    "our experiments have revealed an outstanding sensitivity of the electron spectrum to the angle @xmath36 , especially at @xmath9 .",
    "the sensitivity to in - plane magnetic field is due to both a strong lorent s force , which occurs in studied samples with high electron density , and a weak tunneling between 2d parallel systems .",
    "the presented results indicate that the recently observed ambiguity in the miso amplitude at @xmath5=1 is , most likely , related to a small misalignment between the direction of the magnetic field and the normal to 2d sample in different measurements @xcite .",

    "this property of the quantum states has not been taken into account in the presented model .",
    "we suggest that the observed deviations between experiment and theory are related to the complex structure of quantum levels near the apexes of odd @xmath5 regions .",
    "the complex structure is induced by magnetic breakdown .",
    "magneto - inter - subband oscillations of the resistance of two dimensional electrons are investigated in wide gaas quantum well with three populated subbands placed in tilted magnetic fields . at zero in - plane magnetic field",
    "the oscillations demonstrate three distinct frequencies @xmath253 in reciprocal perpendicular magnetic field @xmath64 .",
    "the low frequency oscillations , lf - miso , is due to enhancement of the electron scattering when landau levels of two lowest , symmetric and antisymmetric subbands , are aligned with each other .",
    "these oscillations obey the relation : @xmath254 .",
    "related to the third subband two hf - misos have much higher frequencies : @xmath75 and @xmath76 due to the higher energy difference between bottoms of the third and lowest subbands : @xmath255 .",
    "hf - misos demonstrate a distinct beating pattern with a beat frequency @xmath256 .",
    "a rotation of the direction of the magnetic field by an angle @xmath36 from the normal to the samples produces dramatic changes of miso . at small @xmath36",
    "the lf - miso maximum and the corresponding antinode of hf - miso at @xmath5=1 disappear . in the @xmath232 plane the @xmath5=1 region",
    "is found to be bounded by a continuous nodal line connecting the @xmath5=3/2 and @xmath5=1/2 nodes of hf - miso .",
    "similar nodal bounding is found for other odd @xmath5 regions .",
    "this bounding correlates with the probability of magnetic breakdown , @xmath257 , between semi - classical trajectories corresponding to symmetric and antisymmetric subbands .",
    "the nodal bounding is mostly completed at @xmath2581/2 for @xmath5=1 and @xmath5=3 regions .",
    "the fourier analysis of the oscillations beyond the bounded regions shows the dominant contribution of the oscillations to be of period @xmath214 corresponding to the electron orbits located at either side of the quantum well and populated by magnetic breakdown . the location of the hf - miso nodes as well as the evolution of the lf - miso maximum on @xmath232 plane are found to be in an excellent agreement with numerical evaluations of the electron spectra .",
