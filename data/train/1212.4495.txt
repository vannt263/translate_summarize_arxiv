    "the recent discovery of what looks very much like a weakly - coupled higgs boson has made the question of the electroweak hierarchy acute . weak - scale susy has long been a favored contender to protect the higgs vacuum expectation value , but the impressive agreement of lhc data with sm predictions has made it clear that most of the mssm particle content must lie beyond the kinematic reach of the 7 and 8 tev lhc if @xmath6-parity is conserved .",
    "only a small subset of the sm superpartners are immediately relevant for the naturalness of the higgs potential , however @xcite .",
    "in particular , only higgsinos , with masses @xmath7 gev , and third - generation squarks @xmath8 , with masses @xmath9 - 500 gev , need to be light to keep ewsb fully natural , though gluinos , winos , and binos must not be too far beyond current lhc energies @xcite . searching for a light stop , or three light third - generation squarks ,",
    "therefore becomes critical for understanding the extent to which susy is relevant for stabilizing the electroweak scale .",
    "the purpose of the present work is twofold .",
    "first , we point out that , in a natural susy spectrum , the pure higgsino nature of the light neutralinos and chargino can significantly weaken the reach in the traditional stop search channel , @xmath10 , and we propose a novel search channel targeting the natural susy spectrum which can recover the lost sensitivity .",
    "second , we introduce a new kinematic variable , _ topness _ , which efficiently suppresses the dominant backgrounds to top partner searches in semileptonic final states .",
    "we demonstrate its performance in both our novel search topology and in more traditional searches .",
    "in the natural susy spectrum , the lightest states are higgsinos and third generation squarks ; the gauginos can be heavier , up to several hundreds of gev .",
    "mass mixing between the higgsinos and the heavier ew gauginos splits the higgsinos ; for example , with @xmath11 , the resulting higgsino masses are @xmath12 .",
    "the total branching ratios for stop decay into the neutral channel , @xmath13 and the charged channel , @xmath14 , depend only on mssm yukawa couplings and phase space .",
    "provided the mass splitting between stops and higgsinos is large enough that the top - higgsino mode is open , the stop branching ratios into charged and neutral higgsino modes are comparable in magnitude over the large majority of parameter space @xcite .",
    "this leads to a sizeable pair - wise branching ratio into the _ mixed _ final state , @xmath15 .",
    "[ fig : brs ] shows stop pair brs to both the mixed channel and the usual search channel @xmath16 in the @xmath17-@xmath18 plane , in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "the total @xmath20 br into the @xmath21 final state can easily be suppressed by a factor of two , while the @xmath20 br into the mixed mode is often comparable or larger .",
    "the sbottom - like signal , @xmath22 , makes up a distant third , except in regions where the neutral decay channel is suppressed by available phase - space .",
    "assuming the gluino is inaccessible , the most stringent collider bounds on this minimal natural susy spectrum are the lep chargino bounds @xcite . we assume for simplicity that the nondegenerate lep bound @xmath23 gev applies , though for sufficiently small splittings between the chargino and the ( n)lsp the limits could be mildly relaxed .",
    "limits from direct stop searches @xcite have some reach in the region of interest ( @xmath24 gev , @xmath25 ) but still leave most of the region unconstrained , particularly when the signal is reduced by a branching ratio @xmath26 . in principle",
    ", the cms razor analysis @xcite could also place interesting limits if analysed subject to this signal hypothesis .    ;",
    "( right ) @xmath16 , for @xmath27 and degenerate higgsinos with mass @xmath28 gev .",
    "[ fig : brs ] ]    in what follows , we use a reference higgsino sector where the mass splitting is taken to be @xmath29",
    ". this splitting is large enough to reflect the possible influence of nearby gauginos but small enough that all higgsinos produced in the decay of 300 - 600 gev stops appear primarily as missing energy : the additional soft daughters produced in the decay of heavier higgsinos down to the ( n)lsp @xmath30 are not boosted enough to pass selection cuts for hard isolated objects .",
    "we use a reference stop pair branching fraction of br@xmath31 , and show results for a reference signal point with @xmath32 gev , @xmath33 gev , @xmath34 unless otherwise specified . in all signal points we take @xmath35 with mixing angle @xmath36 .    we have checked that the modes @xmath37 and @xmath38 pass our selection cuts with efficiencies differing by @xmath39 , with the single largest difference in efficiency coming from isolated lepton acceptance .",
    "thus to good approximation the asymmetric signal is insensitive to the details of the neutralino mixings .",
    "we have chosen a relatively large mass splitting for our reference higgsino sector ; in more degenerate spectra , the difference between @xmath30 and @xmath40 would be negligibly small .",
    "the dominant backgrounds to semileptonic stop searches are dileptonic @xmath41 where one of the leptons is either too soft or too forward to be identified , and @xmath41 events with one lepton and one unidentified @xmath42 .",
    "although three of the six partons in these final states are missing or unidentified , these backgrounds still contain a large amount of kinematic information which can be used to identify events consistent with top quark pair production .",
    "much literature has been devoted to kinematic variables which can identify particle masses in the presence of multiple invisible particles .",
    "two of the most studied variables are the stransverse mass , @xmath43 @xcite , and the contransverse mass @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "both of these variables admit straightforward extensions to the asymmetric decay chains that appear in top backgrounds with missing leptons , as was studied for @xmath43 in @xcite .",
    "we propose here a novel alternative .",
    "dileptonic top events are reconstructible when both leptons are identified : the mass shell conditions provide enough constraints to completely solve for the unmeasured components of the neutrino momenta , up to discrete combinatoric and quadratic ambiguities .",
    "once one of the leptons is lost , this is no longer true : the missing particles are ( by assumption ) now a neutrino and a @xmath45 , and one of the mass - shell conditions is lost along with the lepton , leaving an under - constrained system .",
    "we replace the missing mass - shell condition with the condition that _ the reconstructed center - of - mass energy of the event be minimized_. as the pdfs fall off steeply with @xmath46 , this provides a good approximation to the true event kinematics .",
    "we construct a function @xmath47 which quantifies how well an event can be reconstructed subject to the dileptonic top hypothesis : @xmath48 where in the last term the sum runs over all 5 assumed final state particles .",
    "we have imposed transverse momentum conservation as well as the mass shell conditions @xmath49 , @xmath50 to fix @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 in terms of the four remaining undetermined variables .",
    "the denominators @xmath55 determine the relative weighting of the mass shell conditions , and should not be smaller than typical resolutions ; we take @xmath56 gev , @xmath57 gev , and @xmath58 tev . the value of @xmath59 at its minimum quantifies how well an event can be reconstructed according to the dileptonic top pair hypothesis .",
    "the inputs to @xmath59 are two jets , a lepton , and the @xmath60 . to find the best possible reconstruction , we sum over both possible pairings of jets with reconstructed @xmath61 bosons and keep the pairing which minimizes @xmath62 .",
    "when the event contains two identified @xmath63-jets , we use them as input to @xmath59 ; when the event contains only one identified @xmath63 , we consider the two hardest untagged jets with @xmath64 and @xmath65 gev , and use the pair @xmath66 which yields the minimum value for @xmath62 .",
    "we define _ topness _ as t = ( s ) .",
    "minimization of @xmath59 is a nontrivial computational problem . in our implementation",
    "we use 10 iterations of the nelder - mead algorithm per event . in general this",
    "is not sufficient to find the global minimum ; however , it will find a minimum that is sufficiently close to the global minimum that cuts and distributions are insensitive to any difference .",
    "we show distributions of topness for the major dileptonic and one-@xmath67-one-@xmath42 top backgrounds as well as signal in fig .",
    "[ fig : topness ] . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vsmt2 ] we compare the performance of topness to both the asymmetric implementation of @xmath44 which we find most effective , and @xmath68 , the @xmath43 variant identified as most effective in @xcite .",

    "[ fig : topness],title=\"fig:\",height=105 ]    our present interest is in the asymmetric stop decay mode , but we emphasize that topness is useful in any search where the background is dominated by dileptonic tops with a missed lepton , most notably stop searches in other channels .",

    "[ fig : vsmt2 ] shows the relative performance of topness on the traditional stop signal , @xmath69 , followed by semileptonic top decay , with backgrounds given by missed - lepton @xmath70 events .",

    "topness performs comparably to @xmath72 in the symmetric search channel , realizing ( by a slim margin ) the largest gain in significance among all three variables .",
    "the dilution in the efficacy of topness in the @xmath73 channel , relative to the @xmath74 channel , is because the extra jets in the events give more possibilities for signal to accidentally reconstruct as a top - like event .",

    "in this section we discuss a search strategy for stop pair production in the mode @xmath79 met .",
    "we target semileptonic top decay , so the final state of interest contains one @xmath67 , 2 @xmath63-jets , and missing energy .",
    "we impose the following cuts at _ preselection _ : exactly one lepton satisfying @xmath80 gev , @xmath81 gev , @xmath82 2.5 ; @xmath83 gev , with @xmath84 gev ; and at least two jets with @xmath65 gev and @xmath64 , at least one of which must be @xmath63-tagged .",
    "the cut on @xmath85 suppresses all backgrounds where the @xmath86 arises from a single @xmath45 , in particular semileptonic @xmath41 and the enormous @xmath87 jets , which is further suppressed by the @xmath63-tag requirement .",
    "the major remaining background is therefore dileptonic top pair events where one of the leptons is not identified , either because it falls outside acceptance , or because it is a non - identified @xmath42 .",
    "a secondary background is the associated production of a top with a @xmath45 boson , again with doubly dileptonic decays and a missed lepton .",
    "all major sm backgrounds can be reduced by identifying softer leptons in the event ; we thus reject events containing identified hadronic taus with @xmath64 and @xmath88 gev or additional ( isolated ) leptons with @xmath64 and @xmath89 gev .",
    "importantly , the additional soft decay products of the heavier higgsinos in signal events have negligible impact on the ability of signal to pass the veto",
    ". more aggressive vetos , as in @xcite , would further reduce the backgrounds at little cost to signal .",
    "in addition to cuts on the hardness of final state particles and @xmath86 , we add three novel variables which discriminate signal and background . first and by far",
    "the most important is topness , discussed in the previous section .",
    "another useful variable can be constructed by exploiting the asymmetric signal kinematics .",
    "the @xmath63-jet coming from the decay @xmath90 is typically much harder than the daughters of the top .",
    "the @xmath91 asymmetry r_p_t = of the lepton and the highest @xmath91 @xmath63-jet , is thus useful for distinguishing signal and background .",
    "we also employ a _ centrality _ variable , c = ( |_j_1 , j_2++p/_t| , |_j_2 , j_1++p/_t| ) , formed from the two highest @xmath91 jets @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the event as well as the lepton and missing momentum .",
    "centrality is typically larger for backgrounds than for signal , reflecting both the larger signal masses and the different kinematics of top versus stop pair production @xcite .",
    "distributions of @xmath94 and @xmath95 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptrat ] .",
    "this particular cut on rapidity separations is most useful when used in conjunction with topness , because background events with large topness have often selected an isr jet in place of one of the @xmath63 jets , and this isr jet is distinct in rapidity from the other objects in the event .",

    "leptons are declared isolated if the scalar sum-@xmath91 deposited in a cone of radius @xmath104 around a lepton is less than @xmath105 times the lepton @xmath91 .",
    "the isolation threshold is thus 4 gev for a lepton with @xmath106 gev , which matches well with experimentally employed criteria at threshold .",
