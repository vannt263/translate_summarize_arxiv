    "quantum effects strive to disappear for macroscopic objects .",
    "typically , quantum effects become defamed out into their classical averages , and therefore manipulation of quantum states , relevant for quantum computation , becomes unsustainable at the macroscopic scale .",
    "however , bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) constitute one important exception where quantum effects are perceptible on a macroscopic level . with the advent and rapid developing of laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms over the past decade , micron - sized atomic gases at ultralow temperatures are routinely formed in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "moreover , quantum optic techiques allow for an unprecedent versatile and precise control on internal degrees of freedom , putting cold atoms as one of the most prominent candidates to test complex aspects of strongly correlated matter and to applications in quantum information processing @xcite .    quantum information has been introduced in cold atom systems at various levels @xcite .",
    "one way consists in defining a qubit ( a two - state system ) via two internal states of an atom .",
    "this approach , however , requires each atom to be addressed separately .",
    "a similar problem appears when the qubit is introduced via a set of spatially localized states ( e.g. in adjacent wells of an optical lattice potential ) of an atom or a bec .",
    "the complication is due to the fact that the number of atoms in a bec experiment significantly fluctuates from run to run . as a result ,",
    "any qubit system dependent on the number of atoms becomes problematic .",
    "a second way of producing qubits in these systems relies on collective properties of ultracold atoms . here",
    ", a two - state system can be formed by isolating a pair of macroscopic states that are set sufficiently far away from the multiparticle spectrum . at the same time , however , the energy gap between these lowest states must remain small enough to allow measurable dynamics @xcite .",
    "experiments performed in the double - well potential configuration are a pioneer example of such approach @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , despite the appealing similarity with single - particle two - level states , double - well potentials lack to achieve a macroscopic superposition allowing for a measurable dynamics @xcite . to overcome the superposition issue ,",
    "a more recent proposal based on bec superfluid current states in the ring geometry , analogous to the superconducting flux qubit @xcite , has been discussed @xcite .",
    "more recently , the concept of _ phononic _ reservoir via the manipulation of the phononic degrees of freedom has pushed quantum information realizations to another level , comprising the dynamics of impurities immersed in becs @xcite and reservoir engineering to produce multipartite dark states @xcite .",
    "another important difference in respect to quantum optical system is the possibility to use phononic reservoirs to test non - markovian effects in many - body systems @xcite .",
    "the implementation of quantum gates has been recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another important family of macroscopic structures in becs with potential applications in quantum information are the so - called dark - solitons ( ds ) .",
    "they consist of nonlinear localized depressions in a quasi-1d bec that emerge due to a precise balance between the dispersive and nonlinear effects in the system @xcite , being also ubiquitous in nonlinear optics @xcite , shallow liquids @xcite , magnetic films @xcite .",
    "quasi one - dimensional becs with repulsive interatomic interaction are prone to inception of dark solitons by various methods , like imprinting spatial phase distribution @xcite , inducing density defects in bec @xcite , and by collision of two condensates @xcite .",
    "the stability and dynamics of ds in becs have been a subject of intense research over the last decade @xcite .",
    "recent activity in the field involve studies on the collective aspects of the so - called _ soliton gases _",
    "@xcite , putting dark solitons as a good candidate to investigate many - body physics @xcite .    in this paper , we combine the intrinsic nonlinearity in quasi one - dimensional becs to construct two - level states ( qubits ) with dark solitons .",
    "as we will show , thanks to the unique properties of the ds spectrum , perfectly isolated two - level states are possible to construct . as a result",
    ", a matter - wave qubit of a few khz energy gap is achieved .",
    "the effect of decoherece due to the presence of phonons ( quantum fluctuations around the bacground density ) play the role of a proper quantum reservoir .",
    "remarkably , due to their instrisic slow - time dynamics , bec phonons provide small decoherence rates of few hz , meaning that under typical experimental conditions , ds - qubits have a lifetime comparable to the lifetime of the bec , being only limited by the soliton quantum diffusion (  evaporation \" ) . as we show below",
    ", this effect is not critical and the qubit is still robust within the 100 ms@xmath00.1 s time scale .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , the properties of a single ds in a quasi-1d bec immersed in a second condensate are derived .",
    "we start with the set of coupled gross pitaevskii equations and find under which conditions dss can uniquevocally define a two level atom ( qubit ) . in sec .",
    "iii , we compute the coupling between phonons and dss . sec .",
    "iv discusses the weisskopf - wigner theory to determine the emission rate of the qubit .",
    "some discussion and conclusions about the implications of our proposal in practical quantum information protocols are stated in sec . v.",
    "we consider two - coupled quasi-1d becs .",
    "a quasi 1d gas is produced when the transverse dimension of the trap is larger than or of the order of the @xmath1-wave scattering length and , at the same time , much smaller than the longitudinal extension @xcite . at the mean field level , the dynamics of the system",
    "is thus governed by the time - dependent coupled gross pitaevskii equations @xmath2@xmath3where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the one - dimensional coupling strength between particles in bec@xmath6 ( bec@xmath7 ) and @xmath8 is the inter - particle coupling constant , @xmath9 is the planck constant , @xmath10 is the mass of the atomic species .",
    "we restrict the discussion to repulsive interatomic interacions , @xmath11 . in what follow ,",
    "we assume that a dark soliton is present in bec@xmath6 and @xmath12 such that particles in bec@xmath7 do not interact and can therefore be regarded as a set of free interacting particles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_scheme ] ) .",

    "( [ eq_reflectionless1 ] ) can be obtained by casting the potential term in the form of @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",

    "a two - level system ( qubit ) can be perfectly isolated when the value of @xmath38 ranges as @xmath39at the critical point @xmath40 the two - energy levels merge and the qubit is ill - defined .",

    "( [ one hamiltonian ] ) contains intraband ( @xmath77 ) and interband ( @xmath78 ) terms .",
    "however , for small values of the coupling between the system and the environment , the qubit transition can only be driven by near - resonant phonons , for which te interband coupling amplitude @xmath79 is much larger that the interband terms @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_rwa ] ) . as such , within the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa )",
    ", we can safely drop the intraband terms to obain @xmath82where @xmath83 , @xmath84 and the coupling constant @xmath85 is explicitly given by @xmath86 we notice that the implementation of the rwa approximation also implied the dropping of the counter - rotating terms proportional to @xmath87 and @xmath88 that do not conserve the total number of excitations .",
    "the accuracy of such an approximation can be verified _ a posteriori _ , provided that the emission rate @xmath89 is much smaller than the qubit transition frequency @xmath90 .",

    "neglecting the effect of temperature and other external perturbations , the only source of decoherence of a dark - soliton qubit are te sourrounding phonons . because cold atom experiments are typically very clean , and considering that the zero - temperature approximation is an excellent approximation for quasi-1d becs @xcite , we employ the wigner - weisskopf theory in order to compute the lifetime of the qubit .",
    "we assume the qubit to be initially in its excited state and the field to be in the vacuum state . under such conditons",
    ", the total system+reservoir wavefunction can be parametrized as @xmath94where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the probability amplitudes .",

    "therefore , we have @xmath103 where @xmath104 represents the cauchy principal part describing an additional energy ( lamb ) shift .",

    "in conclusion , we have shown that a dark soliton in a quasi one - dimensional bose - einstein condensate can produce a well isolated two - level system , which can act as a matter - wave qubit of energy gap of a few khz .",
    "this feature is intrinsic to the nonlinear nature of bose - einstein condensates and does not require manipulation of the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms .",
    "we observe that the decoherence induced by the quantum fluctuations ( phonons ) produce a finite qubit lifetime .",
    "quite remarkably , leading calculations provide a qubit lifetime of the order of a few seconds , a time scale comparable to the duration of state - of - the art cold atomic traps . the only major limitation to the qubit robustness is the quantum diffusion of the soliton , which is estimated to reduce the qubit lifetime to around 20% its value .",
    "this puts qubits made of dark solitons as good candidates to store information for large times ( @xmath120 s ) , offering an appealing alternative to quantum optical of solid - state platforms .",
    "while dark solitons may not compete in terms of quantum scalability ( the number of solitons in a typical elongated bec is not expected to surpasse a few tens ) , their unprecedent coherence and lifetime will certainly make them attractive to the design of new quantum memories and quantum gates . moreover , due to the possibility of interfacing cold atomic clouds with solid - state and optical systems , our findings may inspire further applications in hybdrid quantum computers .",
