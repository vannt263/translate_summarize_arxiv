    "systematic spectroscopic observations of far - infrared ( ir ) cooling lines in large samples of local star - forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) were first carried out with _ iso _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite , 2001 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these studies showed that is the most intense far - ir emission line observed in normal , star - forming galaxies ( @xcite ) and starbursts ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , dominating the gas cooling of their neutral inter stellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "this fine - structure line arises from the @xmath11 transition ( @xmath12k ) of singley ionized carbon atoms ( ionization potential=11.26ev and critical density , @xmath13 ; @xmath14 ) which are predominantly excited by collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms ; or with free electrons and protons in regions where @xmath15 ( @xcite ) .",
    "ultraviolet ( uv ) photons with energies @xmath166ev emitted by newly formed stars are able to release the most weakly bound electrons from small dust grains via photo - electric heating ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs )",
    "are thought to be an important source of photo - electrons ( @xcite ) that contribute , through kinetic energy transfer , to the heating of the neutral gas which subsequently cools down via collision with c@xmath17 atoms and other elements in photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the emission accounts , in the most extreme cases , for as much as @xmath18% of the total ir luminosity of galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , the /fir ratio is observed to decrease by more than an order of magnitude in sources with high and warm dust temperatures ( ) . the underlying causes for these trends are still debated .",
    "the physical arguments most often proposed to explain the decrease in /fir are : ( 1 ) self - absorption of the c@xmath17 emission , ( 2 ) saturation of the line flux due to high density of the neutral gas , ( 3 ) progressive ionization of dust grains in high far - uv field to gas density environments , and ( 4 ) high dust - to - gas opacity caused by an increase of the average ionization parameter .",
    "although self absorption has been used to explain the faint emission arising from warm , agn - dominated systems such as mrk  231 ( @xcite ) , this interpretation has been questioned in normal star - forming galaxies due to the requirement of extraordinarly large column densities of gas in the pdrs ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , contrary to the or lines , the emission is observed to arise from the external edges of those molecular clouds exposed to the uv radiation originated from starbursts , as for example in arp  220 ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , self absorption is not the likely explanation of the low /fir ratios seen in most starburst galaxies , except perhaps in a few extreme cases , like ngc  4418 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the emission becomes saturated when the hydrogen density in the neutral medium , , increases to values @xmath19 , provided that the far - uv ( @xmath20ev ) radiation field is not extreme ( @xmath21 ; where is normalized to the average local interstellar radiation field ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , for a constant @xmath22 , an increase of the gas density from @xmath23 to @xmath24 would produce a suppression of the emission of almost 2 orders of magnitude due to the rapid recombination of c@xmath17 into neutral carbon and then into co ( @xcite ) . however , pdr densities as high as @xmath25 are not very common .",
    "and _ iso _ observations of normal star - forming galaxies and some ir - bright sources confine the physical parameters of their pdrs to a range of @xmath26 and @xmath27@xmath28 ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the emission can be also saturated when @xmath29 provided that @xmath30 . in this regime ,",
    "the line is not sensitive to an increase of @xmath31 because the temperature of the gas is well above the excitation potential of the transition .",
    "it has also been suggested that in sources where / is high ( @xmath32 ) the line is a less efficient coolant of the ism because of the following reason . as physical conditions become more extreme ( higher / ) , dust particles progressively increase their positive charge ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this reduces both the amount of photo - electrons released from dust grains that indirectly collisionally excite the gas , as well as the energy that they carry along after they are freed , since they are more strongly bounded .",
    "the net effect is the decreasing of the efficiency in the transformation of incident uv radiation into gas heating without an accompanied reduction of the dust emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in a recent work , @xcite have shown that the deficits observed in several far - ir emission lines ( , , , and ) could be explained by an increase of the average ionization parameter of the ism , @xmath33__u__@xmath34 . in `` dust bounded '' star - forming regions the gas opacity is reduced within the region due to the higher @xmath33__u__@xmath34 .",
    "as a consequence , a significant fraction of the uv radiation is eventually absorbed by large dust grains before being able to reach the neutral gas in the pdrs and ionize the pah molecules ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , causing a deficit of photo - electrons and hence the subsequent suppression of the line with respect to the total far - ir dust emission .",
    "local luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs : @xmath35 ) are a mixture of single galaxies , disk galaxy pairs , interacting systems and advanced mergers , exhibiting enhanced star formation rates , and a lower fraction of agn compared to higher luminous galaxies .",
    "a detailed study of the physical properties of low - redshift lirgs is critical for our understanding of the cosmic evolution of galaxies and black holes since ( 1 ) ir - luminous galaxies comprise the bulk of the cosmic infrared background and dominate star - formation activity between @xmath36 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and ( 2 ) agn activity may preferentially occur during episodes of enhanced nuclear star formation .",
    "moreover , lirgs are now assumed to be the local analogs of the ir - bright galaxy population at @xmath37 .",
    "however , a comprehensive analysis of the most important far - ir cooling lines of the ism in a complete sample of nearby lirgs has not been possible until the advent of the _ herschel space observatory _ ( _ herschel _ hereafter ; @xcite ) and , in particular , its photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ; @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we present the first results obtained from _",
    "herschel_/pacs spectroscopic observations of a complete sample of far - ir selected local lirgs that comprise the great observatories all - sky lirg survey ( goals ; @xcite ) .",
    "using this complete , flux - limited sample of local lirgs , we are able for the first time to perform a systematic , statistically significant study of the far - ir cooling lines of star - forming galaxies covering a wide range of physical conditions : from isolated disks where star formation is spread across kpc scales to the most extreme environments present in late stage major mergers where most of the energy output of the system comes from its central kpc region . in particular ,",
    "in this paper we focus on the line and its relation with the dust emission in lirgs .",
    "we make use of a broad set of mid - ir diagnostics based on _",
    "spitzer_/irs spectroscopy , such as high ionization emission lines , silicate dust opacities , pah equivalent widths ( ew ) , dust luminosity concentrations , and mid - ir colors , to provide the context in which the observed emission and /fir ratios are best explained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ s : sample ] we present the lirg sample and the observations . in  [ s : datared ] we describe the processing and analysis of the data . the results are presented in  [ s : results ] . in  [ s : highz ] we put in context our findings with recent results from intermediate and high redshift surveys started to be carried out by alma and in the future by ccat .",

    "[ s : summary ] .",
    "the great observatories all - sky lirg survey ( goals ; @xcite ) encompasses the complete sample of 202 lirgs and ulirgs contained in the _ iras _ revised bright galaxy sample ( rbgs ; sanders et al .",
    "2003 ) which , in turn , is also a complete sample of 629 galaxies with _ iras _ @xmath38jy and galactic latitudes @xmath39 .",
    "there are 180 lirgs and 22 ulirgs in goals and their median redshift is z = 0.0215 ( or @xmath40mpc ) , with the closest galaxy being at z = 0.0030 ( 15.9mpc ; ngc  2146 ) and the farthest at z = 0.0918 ( 400mpc ; iras  07251 - 0248 ) . to date ,",
    "there are many published and on - going works that have already exploited the potential of all the multi - wavelength data available for this sample including , among others , galex uv @xcite , _ hst _ optical and near - ir ( @xcite ; kim et al .",

    "the rbgs , and therefore the goals sample , were defined based on _ iras _ observations . however , the higher angular resolution achieved by _",
    "spitzer _ allowed us to spatially disentangle galaxies that belong to the same lirg system into separate components .",
    "from the 291 _ individual _ galaxies in goals , not all have _ herschel _ observations . in systems with two or more galactic nuclei , minor companions with mips24@xmath4 m flux density ratios smaller than 1:5 with respect to the brightest galaxy were not requested since their contribution to the total ir luminosity of the system is small . because the angular resolution of _ spitzer _ decreases with wavelength , it was not possible to obtain individual mips 24 , 70 and 160@xmath4 m measurements for all goals galaxies , and therefore to derive uniform ir luminosities for them using _ spitzer _",
    "data only . instead , to calculate the individual , spatially - integrated of lirgs belonging to a system of two or more galaxies , we distributed the @xmath41 of the system as measured by _",

    ": l. armus ) awarded with more than 165 hours of observing time . in this work will focus mainly on the analysis and interpretation of the observations of our galaxy sample .",
    "pacs range spectroscopy of the fine - structure emission line was obtained for 163 individual sources .",
    "our observations were complemented with the inclusion of the remaining lirgs in the goals sample for which observations are publicly available in the archive ( as of october 2012 ) from various _",
    "herschel _ projects . the main programs from which these data were gathered are : kpgt_esturm_1 ( p.i .",
    ": e. sturm ) , kpot_pvanderw_1 ( p.i .",
    ": p. van der werf ) , and ot1_dweedman_1 ( p.i . : d. weedman ) .",
    "the total number of lirg systems for which there are data is 200 ( irasf08339 + 6517 and irasf09111 - 1007 were not observed ) .",
    "however , because some lirgs are actually systems of galaxies ( see above ) , the number of observed galaxies was 241 .",
    "the ifs on pacs is able to perform simultaneous spectroscopy in the @xmath42 or @xmath43 m ( 3rd and 2nd orders , respectively ; `` blue '' camera ) and the @xmath44 m ( 1st order ; `` red '' camera ) ranges .",
    "the ifu is composed by a 5@xmath455 array of individual detectors ( spaxels ) each of one with a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath469.4 , for a total of 47@xmath4547 .",
    "the physical size of the pacs fov at the median distance of our lirg sample is @xmath4720kpc on a side .",
    "the number of spectral elements in each pixel is 16 , which are rearranged together via an image slicer over two 16@xmath4525 ge : ga detector arrays ( blue and red cameras ) .    our astronomical observation requests ( aors )",
    "were consistently constructed using the `` range '' spectroscopy template , which allows the user to define a specific wavelength range for the desired observations .",
    "our selected range was slightly larger than that provided by default for the `` line '' mode .",
    "this was necessary ( 1 ) to obtain parallel observations of the wide absorption feature using the blue camera when observing the line , and ( 2 ) to ensure that the targeted emission lines have a uniform signal - to - noise ratio across their spectral profiles even if they are to be broader than a few hundred .",
    "the high sampling density mode scan , useful to have sub - spectral resolution information of the lines ( see below ) , was employed .",
    "while we requested line maps for some lirgs of the sample ( from two to a few raster positions depending on the target ) , pointed ( one single raster ) chop - nod observations were taken for the majority of galaxies . for those galaxies with maps , only one raster position was used to obtain the line fluxes used in this work .",
    "the chopper throw varied from small to large depending on the source .",
    "spectroscopy of the lirgs included in goals but observed by other programs in was not always obtained using the `` range '' mode but some of them were observed using `` linescan '' spectroscopy . the",
    "s / n of the data varies not only from galaxy to galaxy but also depending on the emission line considered .",
    "we provide uncertainties for all quantities used across the analysis presented here that are based on the individual spectrum of each line , therefore reflecting the errors associated with @xmath48and measured directly on@xmath48 the data .      as part of the _ spitzer _ goals legacy ,",

    "spitzer_/irs low resolution ( r@xmath49 ) slit spectroscopy ( sl module : @xmath50 m , and ll module : @xmath51 m ) .",
    "the 244 irs spectra were extracted using the standard extraction aperture and point source calibration mode in spice .",
    "the projected angular sizes of the apertures on the sky are 3.7@xmath4512 at the average wavelength of 10@xmath4 m in sl and 10.6@xmath4535 at the average wavelength of 26@xmath4 m in ll .",
    "thus , the area covered by the sl aperture is approximately equivalent ( within a factor of @xmath52 ) to that of an individual spaxel of the ifs in pacs , and so is that of the ll aperture to a 3@xmath453 spaxel box .",
    "the observables derived from the irs data that we use in this work are the strength of the 9.7@xmath4 m silicate feature , , and the ew of the , which were presented in stierwalt et al .",
    "( 2013a ) .",
    "we refer the reader to this work for further details about the reduction , extraction , calibration , and analysis of the spectra .",
    "the _ herschel _ interactive processing environment ( hipe ; v8.0 ) application was used to retrieve the raw data from the _ herschel _ science archive ( hsa ) as well as to process them .",
    "we used the script for `` linescan '' observations ( also valid for `` range '' mode ) included within hipe to reduce our spectra .",
    "we processed the data from level 0 up to level 2 using the following steps : flag and reject saturated data , perform initial calibrations , flag and reject `` glitches '' , compute the differential signal of each on - off pair of data - points for each chopper cycle , calculate the relative spectral response function , divide by the response , convert frames to pacs cubes , and correct for flat - fielding ( this extra step is included in v8.0 of hipe and later versions , and helps to improve the accuracy of the continuum level ) .",
    "next , for each camera ( red or blue ) , hipe builds the wavelength grid , for which we chose a final rebinning with an _",
    "_ oversample__=2 , and an _ _ upsample__=3 that corresponds to a nyquist sampling .",
    "the spectral resolution achieved at the position of the line was derived directly from the data and is @xmath46235 .",
    "the final steps are : flag and reject remaining outliers , rebin all selected cubes on consistent wavelength grids and , finally , average the nod - a and nod - b rebinned cubes ( all cubes at the same raster position are averaged ) .",
    "this is the final science - grade product currently possible for single raster observations . from this point on",
    ", the analysis of the spectra was performed using in - house developed idl routines .      to obtain the flux of a particular source we use an iterative procedure to find the line and",
    "measure its basic parameters .",
    "first , we fit a linear function to the continuum emission , which is evaluated at the edges of the spectrum , masking the central 60% of spectral elements ( where the line is expected to be detected ) and without using the first and final 10% , where the noise is large due to the poor sampling of the scanning .",
    "then , we fit a gaussian function to the continuum - subtracted spectrum and calculate its parameters .",
    "we define a line as not detected when the peak of the gaussian is below 2.5@xmath53 the standard deviation of the continuum , as measured in the previous step . on the other hand ,",
    "if the line is found , we return to the original , total spectrum and fit again the continuum using this time a wavelength range determined by the two portions of the spectrum adjacent to the line located beyond @xmath54 from its center ( where @xmath55 is the width of the fitted gaussian ) and the following @xmath5615% of spectral elements .",
    "we then subtract this continuum from the total spectrum and fit the line again .",
    "the new parameters of the gaussian are compared with the previous ones .",
    "this process is repeated until the location , sigma and intensity of the line converge with an accuracy of 1% , or when reaching 10 iterations . due to the merger - driven nature of many lirgs ,",
    "their gas kinematics are extremely complicated and , as a consequence , the emission lines of several sources present asymmetries and double peaks in their profiles . however , despite the fact that the width determined by the fit is not an accurate representation of the real shape of the line , it can be used as a first order approximation for its broadness .",
    "therefore , instead of using the parameters of the gaussian to derive the flux of the line , we decided to integrate directly over the final continuum - subtracted spectrum within the @xmath54 region around the central position of the line .",
    "the associated uncertainty is calculated as the standard deviation of the latest fitted continuum , integrated over the same wavelength range as the line .",
    "absolute photometric uncertainties due to changes in the pacs calibration products are not taken into account ( the version used in this work was pacs_cal_32_0 ) .",
    "we obtained the line fluxes for our lirgs from the spectra extracted from the spaxel at which the line + continuum emission of each galaxy peaks within the pacs fov .",
    "the _ spitzer_/irs and _ herschel _ pointings usually coincide within @xmath57 .",
    "there are a few targets for which the irs pointing is located more than half a spaxel away from that of pacs . in these cases",
    ", we decided to obtain the nuclear line flux of the galaxy by averaging the spaxels closest to the coordinates of the irs pointing .",
    "these values are used only when pacs and irs measurements are compared directly in the same plot .",
    "there is one additional lirg system , iras03582 + 6012 , for which the pacs pointing exactly felt in the middle of two galaxies separated by only 5 .",
    "this lirg is not used in the comparisons of the emission to the irs data since the two individual sources can not be disentangled .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ ss : irsobs ] , the angular size of a pacs spaxel is roughly similar ( within a factor of 2 ) to that of the aperture used to extract the _ spizer_/irs spectra of our galaxies .",
    "because the pacs beam is under - sampled at 160@xmath4 m ( fwhm@xmath58 compared with the @xmath59 size of the pacs spaxels ) , and most of the sources in the sample are unresolved at 24@xmath4 m in our mips images ( which have a similar angular resolution as pacs at @xmath60 m ) , an aperture correction has to be performed to the spectra extracted from the emission - peak spaxel of each galaxy to obtain their total nuclear fluxes .",
    "this was the same procedure employed to obtain the mid - ir irs spectra of our lirgs .",
    "the nominal , wavelength - dependent aperture correction function provided by hipe v8.0 works optimally when the source is exactly positioned at the center of a given spaxel .",
    "however , in some occasions the pointing of _ herschel _ is not accurate enough to achieve this and the target can be slightly misplaced @xmath61 ( up to 1/3 of a spaxel ) from the center . in these cases ,",
    "the flux of the line might be underestimated .",
    "we explored whether this effect could be corrected by measuring the position of the source within the spaxel .",
    "however , some lirgs in our sample show low surface - brightness extended emission , either because of their proximity and/or merger nature , or simply because the gas and dust emission are spatially decoupled .",
    "this , combined with the spatial sub - sampling of the pacs / ifs detector and the poor s / n of some sources prevented us from obtaining an accurate measurement of the spatial position and angular width of the emission and therefore from obtaining a more refined aperture correction .",
    "thus , we performed only the nominal aperture correction provided by hipe .",
    "the _ iras _ far - ir fluxes used throughout this paper were calculated as @xmath62 [ ] , with @xmath63 in [ jy ] .",

    "this definition of the fir accounts for the flux emitted within the @xmath66 m wavelength range as originally defined in @xcite .",
    "the far - ir fluxes and luminosities of galaxies were then matched to the aperture with which the nuclear flux was extracted ( see above ) by scaling the integrated _ iras _ far - ir flux of the lirg system with the ratio of the continuum flux density of each individual galaxy evaluated at 63@xmath4 m in the pacs spectrum ( extracted at the same position and with the same aperture as the line ) to the total _ iras _",

    "the goals sample , though , populates a warmer far - ir color regime . despite the increase in dispersion at 63/158@xmath71m@xmath81 or /fir@xmath82 ( basically in the ulirg domain ) , the fact that we find the same tight trend independently of the range of ir luminosities covered by the two samples suggests that the main observable linked to the variation of the /fir ratio is the average temperature of the dust ( ) in galaxies . this interpretation agrees with the last physical scenario described in the introduction , in which an increase of the ionization parameter , @xmath33__u__@xmath34 , would cause the far - uv radiation from the youngest stars to be less efficient in heating the gas in those galaxies . at the same time",
    ", dust grains would be on average at higher temperatures due to the larger number of ionizing photons per dust particle available in the outer layers of the regions , close to the pdrs .",
    "indeed , the presence of dust within regions has been recently observed in several star - forming regions in our galaxy ( @xcite ) . both effects combined can explain the wide range of /fir ratios and far - ir colors we observe in the most warm lirgs .",
    "variations in , though , could be responsible for the dispersion in /fir seen at a given 63/158@xmath71 m ratio .",
    "to further support these findings , the bottom panel of figure  [ f : ciifirvsf63f158 ] shows that the ratio of flux to the monochromatic continuum at @xmath46158@xmath4 m under the line ( the ew ) of the warmest galaxies is only a factor of @xmath83 lower than the average ew displayed by colder sources at 63/158@xmath71m@xmath84 .",
    "this implies that the decrease of the /fir ratio seen in our lirgs is primarily caused by a significant increase in warm dust emission ( peaking at @xmath85 m ) , most likely associated with the youngest stars , that is not followed by a proportional enhancement of the emission line .",

    "the formal fit ( solid line ) can be expressed as :    @xmath94    [ e : defvslsd ]    with a dispersion in the y - axis of 0.30dex .    within the context described in the previous section , the contrast between the inner layer of dust that is being heated by the ionizing radiation to @xmath95k and that of the cold dust at @xmath9620k emitting at @xmath97 m would create both : ( 1 )",
    "the silicate absorption seen at 9.7@xmath71 m due to the larger temperature gradient between the two dust components and ( 2 ) the increasingly higher 63/158@xmath71 m ratios seen in figure  [ f : ciifirvsf63f158 ] due to the progressively larger amount of dust mass that is being heated to higher temperatures .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the physical properties of the ism found in the extreme environments of ulirgs , in which the fraction of total dust luminosity contributed by the diffuse ism decreases significantly , and the emission from dust at @xmath98k arising from optically - thick `` birth clouds '' ( with ages @xmath99myr ) accounts for @xmath10080% of their ir energy output ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , our findings are also in agreement with recent results showing that the increase of the silicate optical depth in lirgs is related with the flattening of their radio spectral index ( 1.4 to 8.44ghz ) due to an increase of free - free absorption , suggesting that the dust obscuration must largely be originated in the vicinity and/or within the starburst region ( murphy et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "there are a few galaxies that do not follow the correlation fitted in figure  [ f : ciifirvssiabs ] , showing very large silicate strengths ( @xmath101 ) and small /fir ratios ( @xmath102 ) typical of ulirgs or , in general , warm galaxies ( see color coding or figure  [ f : ciifirvsf63f158 ] ) .",
    "we would like to note that the trend found for the majority of our sample only reaches values up to around @xmath103 which , interestingly , is only slightly larger than the apparent optical depth limit that a obscuring clumpy medium can explain ( @xcite ) .",
    "larger ( more negative ) values of the silicate strength can only be achieved by a geometrically thick ( smooth ) distribution of cold dust , suggesting that the extra dust absorption seen in these few galaxies may not be related with the star - forming region from where the and far - ir emissions arise .",
    "but then , what is the origin of this excess of obscuration ?",
    "one possibility is that it is caused by foreground cold dust not associated with the starburst .",
    "this has been seen in some heavily obscured compton - thick agns , where most of the deep silicate absorption measured in these objects seems to originate from dust located in the host galaxy ( @xcite ; gonzalez - martin et al .",
    "alternatively , the presence of an extremely warm source ( different from the star - forming region(s ) that are producing the far - ir and emission ) could contribute with additional emission of hot dust ( t@xmath104k ) to the mid - ir .",
    "if at the same time this source is deeply buried ( optically thick ) and embedded in layers of progressively colder dust ( geometrically thick ) , it could produce a cumulative absorption that we would measure via the strength of the silicate feature while still contributing to the emission outside of it ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .    while both explanations are plausible , the second is favored by the fact that these extremely obscured galaxies show mips 24/70@xmath4 m ratios very similar , or even slightly higher than those found for the rest of the lirgs in the sample .",
    "if foreground cold dust was the responsible for the excess of obscuration , we would expect these galaxies to show abnormally low 24@xmath4 m luminosities with respect to the far - ir .",
    "we find that this is not the case , in agreement with recent results based on radio observations of a sub - sample of lirgs in goals ( murphy et al .",
    "furthermore , the existence of an additional hot and obscured dust component in these lirgs is also consistent with the results presented in stierwalt et al .",
    "( 2013a ) , where it is shown that there is a trend for lirgs with moderate silicate strengths ( @xmath105 ) to show higher @xmath7030@xmath71m/@xmath7015@xmath71 m ratios as the becomes stronger ( more negative ) .",
    "that is , more obscured lirgs have increasingly larger fluxes at 30@xmath71 m , in agreement with our findings in the previous section .",
    "however , galaxies showing the most extreme silicate strengths ( @xmath106 ) do not have proportionally higher 30/15@xmath71 m ratios . on the contrary , they show ratios similar to those of warm lirgs with mild silicate strengths ( or even lower than expected given their extreme ) , supporting the idea that in these particular galaxies the dust producing this additional absorption and excess of mid - ir emission ( @xmath107 m ) represents a component of the overall nuclear starburst activity different than the star - forming regions that drive the far - ir cooling .",
    "the compactness of the starburst region of a galaxy has been proven to be related to many of its other physical properties ( @xcite ) .",
    "for example , all ulirgs in the goals sample have very small mid - ir emitting regions , with sizes ( measured fwhms ) @xmath108kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "lirgs , on the other hand , span a large range in sizes as well as in how much of their mid - ir emission is extended .",
    "the later property is parametrized in @xcite by the fraction of extended emission , fee@xmath109 , which measures the fraction of light emitted by a galaxy that is contained outside of its unresolved component at a given wavelength @xmath110 .",
    "the complementary quantity @xmath111fee@xmath109 measures how compact the source is , which in turn is proportional to its luminosity surface density , @xmath112 .",
    "we note that in this paper we use the word compactness as an equivalent to light concentration , i.e. , as a measurement of the amount of energy per unit area produced by a source , and not as an absolute measurement of its size .",
    "it has been shown that the compactness of the mid - ir continuum emission of lirgs ( evaluated at @xmath113 m ) is related to their merger stage , mid - ir agn - fraction and most importantly , to their far - ir color ( @xcite ) .",
    "lirgs with higher _ iras _",
    "@xmath7060@xmath71m/@xmath70100@xmath71 m ratios are increasingly compact . in other words , for a given , the dust in sources with far - ir colors peaking at shorter wavelengths is not only hotter but also confined towards a smaller volume in the center of galaxies . in  [ ss : warm ] we found that the /fir ratio is related to the average @xmath114 of our galaxies .",
    "thus , we should expect to see a correlation between the deficit and the luminosity surface density and compactness of lirgs in the mid - ir .",

    "it is known that the contribution of an agn to the ir emission in lirgs increases with ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is most noticeable at mid - ir wavelengths ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) but a non - negligible fraction of the far - ir emission of ulirgs can also be powered by an agn .",
    "the ew of mid - ir pah features is a simple diagnostic that has been widely used for the detection of agn activity in galaxies at low and high redshifts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; stierwalt et al .",
    "broadly speaking , the pah ew decreases as a component of hot dust at t@xmath118k , normally ascribed to an agn , starts to increasingly dominate the mid - ir continuum emission of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , the hard radiation field of an agn could be able to destroy a significant fraction of the smallest pah molecules ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , a galaxy is regarded as mid - ir agn - dominated when its ew @xmath119 , and it is classified as a pure starburst when ew @xmath120 ( although these limits are not strict ) . sources with intermediate values are considered composite galaxies , in which both starburst and agn may contribute significantly to the mid - ir emission .",
    "figure  [ f : ciifirvslsdpah ] shows the /fir ratio as a function of the ir luminosity surface density , @xmath9 , of the lirgs in goals , color - coded as a function of their ew . as we can see , when only pure star - forming galaxies are considered ( ews @xmath121 m ) , the /fir ratio drops by an order of magnitude , from @xmath7 to @xmath122 .",
    "this indicates that the decrease in /fir among the majority of lirgs is not caused by a rise of agn activity but instead is a fundamental property of the starburst itself .",
    "it is only in the most extreme cases , when /fir@xmath102 , that the agn could play a significant role .",
    "in fact , powerful agn do not always reduce the /fir ratio , as shown also in @xcite .",
    "@xcite also find that the agn - powered sources in their high - redshift galaxy sample display small /fir ratios .",
    "however , they speculate that except for two blazars , the deficit seen in these sources could be caused compact , nuclear starbursts ( with sizes less than @xmath123kpc ) perhaps triggered by the agn .",
    "we will return to this discussion in ",
    "[ ss : definagn ] .",
    "the result obtained above also implies that the line alone is not a good tracer of the sfr in most local lirgs since it does not account for the increase of warm dust emission ( figure  [ f : ciifirvsf63f158 ] ) seen in the most compact galaxies that is usually associated with the most recent starburst . in figure",

    "this further supports the idea that the influence of agn activity is negligible among ir - selected galaxies with @xmath125/fir@xmath126 and that the increase in ir luminosity of these sources is due to a boost of their warm dust emission .",

    "starburst sources with large pah ews have a mean /fir ratio of @xmath127 with a standard deviation of @xmath80 .",
    "as the ew becomes smaller the dispersion increases and we find galaxies with both very small ratios as well as sources with normal values ( or slightly lower than those ) typical of purely star - forming sources ( see also @xcite ) .    if agns contribute significantly to the far - ir emission of lirgs and/or suppress pah emission via photo - evaporation of its carriers , we would expect agn - dominated sources to show significantly low /fir ratios and small pah ews .",
    "we have used the _",
    "spitzer_/irs spectra of our galaxies to identify which of them are hosting an agn based on several mid - ir diagnostics : ( 1 ) /@xmath128 ; ( 2 ) /@xmath129 ; ( 3 ) @xmath7030@xmath71m/@xmath7015@xmath71 m @xmath130 ( i.e. , @xmath131 for @xmath132 ) ; as well as ( 4 ) the ew itself ( see constraints above ) .",
    "all these thresholds are rather restrictive and ensure that the contribution of an agn to the mid - ir luminosity of a galaxy is _ at least _ @xmath133% . in figure  [ f : ciifirvspahew ] we mark those sources that have at least two positive indicators of agn activity as red stars . we note that this excludes sources with low ews and no other agn signatures , and is a more conservative cut than applied in @xcite to identify potential agns .",
    "strikingly , these sources are not preferentially found at the bottom - left of the parameter space but instead as many as 2/3 show /fir@xmath134 , typical of star - forming sources with large ews .",
    "this suggests that the impact of the agn on the far - ir luminosity of these mid - ir dominated agn lirgs is very limited , unless the it contributes to both the and far - ir in the same relative amount as the starburst does .",
    "while @xmath135% of our sample appears to have significant agn contribution to the mid - ir emission ( @xcite ) , the fraction in which the agn dominates the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy is much smaller . to investigate this , we use two of the indicators described above , the line and the ew , and the formulation given in @xcite to calculate the bolometric agn fraction of those galaxies with at least two mid - ir agn detections .",
    "we find that only four ( 20% ) of these galaxies have contributions @xmath136% in both indicators ( black crosses in figure  [ f : ciifirvspahew ] ) .",

    "we argued in ",

    "this adds evidence to the result obtained above that this type of deeply embedded objects only dominate the luminosity of the galaxy in the mid - ir .",
    "furthermore , we would like to emphasize that the fact that the source of this warm , compact emission does not produce the detected pah or emissions rules out models where pah obscuration is invoked to explain the low pah ews found in these sources , since their observed flux compared to that of the far - ir is also very low , implying that it is not extinction but rather the fact that the pdr emission of the warmest dust component in these lirgs is actually extremely limited .",
    "at intermediate redshifts , @xmath147 , it has been found that ir - luminous galaxies span a wide range in /fir ratios : @xmath148 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a surprising discovery came from the most luminous systems , and the fact that many of them show values of this ratio similar to those found in local , lower luminosity galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "recently , @xcite has found that the majority of star - forming galaxies , from the nearby universe and up to @xmath152 , follow a `` main sequence '' ( ms ) that is depicted by a specific sfr ( ssfr@xmath153 ) that increases with redshift .",
