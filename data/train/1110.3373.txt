    "the video ( entry # v011 , aps 64@xmath0 annual dfd meeting 2011 ) demonstrates the patterns exhibited by gravity - driven , particle - laden thin films flowing down a solid substrate .",
    "the results from three experiments are shown in the video .",
    "a finite volume of fluid mixed with particles is allowed to flow down the solid plane ; visualization is achieved from the front view and the videos have been recorded with a digital slr camera ( canon eos rebel t2i ) .",
    "the substrate angle of inclination is fixed at @xmath1 while the dimensionless particle concentration , @xmath2 ( scaled on a characteristic concentration associated with maximum packing ) increases from left ( blue particles , @xmath3 ) to middle ( red particles , @xmath4 ) to right ( yellow particles , @xmath5 ) .",
    "the runtime associated with the individual videos has been fast - forwarded in order to demonstrate concurrently the onset of flow instabilities as well as the development of fingering patterns . from left to right , the runtime speed has been increased by 2 , 4 and 20 times , respectively .",
    "the choice of parameters allows the presentation of three , distinct regimes . in this video , we attribute solely the difference in interfacial characteristics between the three regimes , to variations in particle concentration . for small concentrations ( left video , blue particles ) , the particles settle rapidly allowing the clear fluid to flow over them which results in fingering . for relatively large concentrations ( right video , yellow particles ) , the particles aggregate at the contact line , forming a particle - rich ridge which appears to suppress the fingering . for intermediate concentrations ( middle video , red particles )",
    ", we observe a well - mixed regime characterized by finger formation .",
