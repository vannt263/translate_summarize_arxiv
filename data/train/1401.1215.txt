    "understanding physical conditions within the diffuse neutral interstellar medium ( ism ) is essential for producing realistic models of star and galaxy formation .",
    "ambient gas temperature and density are crucial input parameters for heating , cooling and feedback recipes on all astronomical scales .",
    "while numerical simulations are becoming increasingly complex , details regarding neutral gas temperature distributions , shielding properties , essential feedback sources , and excitation processes are still very much under debate @xcite .",
    "the excitation processes of the 21-cm line are especially important for interpreting radio signals from early epochs of cosmic structure formation ( e.g. , the cosmic dark ages and subsequent epoch of reionization ) , when neutral hydrogen dominated the baryonic content of the universe and facilitated the formation of the first stars and galaxies @xcite . to interpret 21-cm signals from the early universe ,",
    "it is necessary to decouple astrophysical effects from cosmological effects which is likely best done by analyzing excitation processes in the local ism .",
    "traditional ism models contain two neutral phases , the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) and the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) , individually in thermal and pressure equilibrium @xcite .",
    "widely - accepted theoretical properties of these phases in the milky way include : a kinetic temperature of @xmath2@xmath3 and a volume density of @xmath4@xmath5 for the cnm , and @xmath6@xmath7 and @xmath8@xmath9 for the wnm @xcite .",
    "a convenient tracer for neutral gas is the hi 21-cm line , originating from the hyperfine energy splitting caused by magnetic moment interactions between the hydrogen atom s electron and proton .",
    "the high optical depth of the cnm makes 21-cm absorption signatures easy to detect , even with low sensitivity observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the excitation temperature ( or spin temperature , @xmath10 ) of the cnm can be directly estimated by solving radiative transfer equations .",
    "in contrast , the wnm is characterized by very - low peak optical depth and so measuring its spin temperature from absorption requires extremely high sensitivity , @xmath11 and attention to systematic errors . only two direct measurements of wnm spin temperature exist so far @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite observed absorption in the direction of cygnus a , an exceptionally bright radio continuum source with a flux density of @xmath12 , and achieved excellent sensitivity with orders of magnitude less integration time than is required for the majority of ( @xmath13 ) radio continuum sources .",
    "less accurate are upper limits on @xmath14 ( and thus @xmath10 since @xmath15 ) estimated by spectral linewidths @xcite , and approximate @xmath10 estimates obtained by assigning a single temperature to strongly - absorbing , complex hi profiles @xcite .",
    "relating measured hi spin temperatures to model - predicted kinetic temperatures is further complicated by the uncertainty in the excitation mechanisms involved . the 21-cm transition in the high - density cnm",
    "is expected to be thermalized by collisions with electrons , ions , and other hi atoms , resulting in @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast , low densities in the wnm imply that collisions can not thermalize the 21-cm transition and therefore @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , the ly-@xmath1 radiation field from galactic and extragalactic sources can serve to thermalize the transition .",
    "this requires a very large optical depth and a large number of scatterings of ly-@xmath1 photons to bring the radiation field and the gas into local thermal equilibrium .",
    "while the underlying atomic physics is understood @xcite , the details of ly-@xmath1 radiative transfer are complicated and depend on the topology and the strength of the ly-@xmath1 radiation field , which are complex and poorly constrained in the multi - phase ism @xcite .",
    "to measure the physical properties of the wnm and the coupling between neutral gas and ly-@xmath1 radiation , we are conducting a large survey , 21-cm spectral line observations of neutral gas with the evla ( 21sponge ) , to obtain high - sensitivity milky way hi absorption spectra using the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) .",
    "the recently upgraded capabilities of the vla allow us to routinely achieve rms noise levels in optical depth of @xmath18 per 0.42 kms@xmath19 channel , which are among the most sensitive observations of hi absorption to date .",
    "currently , 24 out of 58 sightlines are complete after over 200 hours of observing time .",
    "this paper summarizes our initial results from this project and the detection of the wnm using a newly developed analysis technique based on the spectral stacking of hi absorption and emission spectra . in section  [ s :",
    "obs ] , we summarize our observing and data processing strategies , results of the stacking analysis are provided in section  [ s : stacking ] and discussed in section  [ s : discussion ] , and we present our conclusions in section  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "each source , selected from the nrao / vla sky survey @xcite , was chosen to have a 1.4 ghz flux density @xmath20 to avoid excessively long integration times with the vla to reach the desired sensitivity .",
    "in addition , we select sources generally at high galactic latitude ( @xmath21 @xmath22 10@xmath23 ) to avoid complicated cnm profiles associated with the galactic plane , and with angular sizes less than @xmath24 to avoid resolving substantial flux density .",
    "all vla observations use three separate , standard l - band configurations , each with one dual - polarization intermediate frequency band of width @xmath25 with 256 channels , allowing for a velocity coverage of @xmath26 and resolution of @xmath27 .",
    "we perform bandpass calibration via frequency switching , and all data were reduced using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the absorption spectra , @xmath28 , were extracted from the final cleaned data cubes following calibration detailed in the 21sponge pilot paper @xcite .",
    "in addition , for each sightline we obtain hi emission profiles which estimate the brightness temperature ( @xmath29 ) in the absence of the radio continuum source . of our 24 sightlines ,",
    "11 have emission profiles from the millennium arecibo 21-cm absorption line survey @xcite , 10 have emission profiles from the galactic arecibo l - band feed array survey in hi ( galfa  hi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and for 3 sightlines which were not included in the millennium survey or the galfa - hi survey to date , we use emission spectra from the leiden argentine bonn ( lab ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey .",
    "arecibo hi emission spectra have not been corrected for contamination entering the telescope beam through distant sidelobes ( so called stray radiation ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      to estimate @xmath10 for individual spectral components , we follow the method of @xcite .",
    "we first fit each absorption profile with gaussian functions assuming thermal and turbulent broadening .",
    "we apply the statistical @xmath30-test to determine the best - fit number of components .",
    "we then fit the @xmath29 profile simultaneously for additional gaussian components and @xmath10 for each absorption - detected component by solving the radiative transfer equations discussed at length in @xcite .",
    "these results will be presented along with additional survey information in murray et al .",
    "2014 ( in prep ) .",
    "we next construct `` residual '' spectra to search for weak absorption features below our observational sensitivity by removing fitted models from the absorption and emission profiles .",
    "the best - fitting gaussian components in absorption ( @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the @xmath33 component ) are subtracted from each original absorption profile @xmath28 to produce a residual absorption spectrum , @xmath34 . the corresponding emission contribution from these components , @xmath35 ,",
    "is removed from each emission profile , to produce a residual emission spectrum @xmath36 .",
    "each residual emission spectrum is dominated by signals from the wnm purely detected in emission .",
    "correspondingly , each residual absorption spectrum , @xmath37 , contains noise , model imperfections and weak absorption components below our detection threshold .    to minimize the effects of model imperfections in our results , we exclude sources from our analysis which have strong model - subtraction errors using the following technique .",
    "we first calculate the expected noise profile of the absorption spectrum , @xmath38 , for each source . because the lab survey uses antennas of comparable size to those of the vla , we follow methods described by @xcite to estimate @xmath38 using lab hi emission .",
    "we next produce probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of @xmath39 and exclude from further analysis 5/24 sources whose pdfs deviate from a normal distribution at @xmath40% confidence .",
    "the excluded sources are significantly contaminated by model - subtraction artifacts , and lie at low galactic latitude where lines of sight probe many velocity - blended hi clouds , which complicates gaussian modeling .",
    "table  1 lists the source name , @xmath41 calculated per @xmath42 velocity channel in offline channels , a weighting factor described in section 3 , and galactic coordinates .",
    "we have performed a spectral `` stacking '' analysis on our 19 remaining residual spectra to search for extremely weak absorption signals from the diffuse wnm .",
    "we first apply a velocity shift to both the residual emission and absorption profiles to remove the effect of galactic rotation and align any remaining signals at @xmath43 .",
    "the velocity shifts are computed using the first velocity moment of the residual emission spectrum for each source , so that @xmath44 . to maximize the signal to noise ratio of the stacked absorption spectrum , the weight , @xmath45 , for each profile is given by @xmath46 ( treister et al .",
    "however , as discussed in the previous section , @xmath47 . for constant @xmath10 , we have @xmath48 , and so the weight simplifies to : @xmath49 .",
    "we measure @xmath41 in the offline channels of each profile , and list these values with the weights @xmath45 , normalized by the sum over all @xmath50 profiles , @xmath51 , in table 1 .",
    "the same weighting values were applied to the residual emission spectra .",
    "the weighted profiles are averaged to produce the final stacked emission and stacked absorption spectra shown in figure [ f : stack ] .",
    "the rms noise in the stacked absorption spectrum is @xmath52 , calculated over a fixed range of channels ( @xmath53 to @xmath54 and -@xmath54 to -@xmath55 ) .",
    "this is 4.2 times more sensitive than the median rms noise calculated in the same velocity channels in the individual residual absorption profiles ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the enhanced sensitivity enabled by stacking allows us to detect a weak and broad absorption component which has a velocity width and centroid consistent with the stacked _ emission _ signal ( figure  [ f : stack ] ) .",
    "this gives confidence that the stacked profiles trace physically related quantities .",
    "this broad absorption component is the weighted - mean , @xmath43-centered absorption signal over all sightlines , and has an equivalent width ( @xmath57 ) within the velocity range common to all shifted profiles ( @xmath5846 to @xmath59 ) of @xmath60 = @xmath61 .",
    "we next conduct a bootstrapping ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) monte carlo simulation to estimate the integrated strength of the stacked absorption signal ( figure  [ f : stack]b ) and test for contamination by outlier spectra .",
    "we run the stacking analysis on a new sample of 19 sightlines randomly chosen from our original 19 sightlines with replacement .",
    "we repeat this trial @xmath62 times , each time recomputing the @xmath57 .",
    "the resultant normalized pdf of @xmath57s ( figure  [ f : histo]a , solid histogram ) is nearly gaussian , showing that the stacked @xmath57 signal is consistent with being drawn from a parent population of spectra with comparable means , and not due to a few outlier spectra .",
    "the peak of the @xmath57 distribution and the numerically - integrated @xmath63 confidence limits are @xmath64 , giving 1 in @xmath65 chance of being spurious ( 5@xmath66 ) .",
    "figure  [ f : histo]a also displays the result of repeating the bootstrapping simulation while inverting ( or multiplying by @xmath67 ) a random selection of half of the profiles ( dotted histogram ) .",
    "the result is fully consistent with zero signal , verifying that our stacking method does not produce spurious detections .    using the monte carlo bootstrapping method",
    ", we also constrain the fwhm and peak optical depth of the stacked absorption feature by gaussian fit as @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( at the central velocity of the feature , @xmath70 ) , respectively . both quantities",
    "have well - defined , single - peaked distributions , suggesting that the detection is tracing a single gas component rather than a blend of many narrow components .",
    "we therefore proceed to estimate the typical spin temperature @xmath10 of the gas detected in the stacked absorption spectrum .",
    "we use three methods : ( 1 ) @xmath71 , ( 2 ) @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the velocity at the peak of the smoothed stacked absorption signal , and ( 3 ) by the methods of @xcite , fitting a single gaussian component to the absorption stack and solving for @xmath10 by fitting this component to the emission stack without additional components . for",
    "each of the @xmath62 bootstrapping trials , we compute all three @xmath10 estimates and combine their distributions to minimize systematic errors associated with any individual approach ( figure  [ f : histo]b ) .",
    "we estimate a spin temperature of the detected absorption feature of @xmath0 ( @xmath74% confidence ) , with a lower limit at @xmath75% confidence of @xmath76 .",
    "we note that by shifting the residual profiles by the second velocity moment or by the location of maximum @xmath77 , we find consistent temperature estimates with similar significance .",
    "the possible contamination of stray radiation to the arecibo hi emission spectra has no effect on the presence of the absorption stack , although it will tend to increase the ew of the emission stack , and therefore increase the estimated @xmath10 of the stacked feature . for the galfa - hi survey , @xcite estimated that the level of stray radiation contamination is @xmath78@xmath79 , leading to an overestimate in our computed @xmath10 of at most 13%",
    ". therefore , the presence of stray radiation in our arecibo hi emission spectra would not change our results",
    "in figure  [ f : temp ] , we plot all previous wnm @xmath10 detections ( open symbols ) against the rms noise in off - line channels of the individual absorption spectra in which they were detected , with @xmath80 error bars derived from line fitting .",
    "we exclude literature measurements which are estimated as upper limits from @xmath14 or which assume single temperatures for multi - component sightlines .",
    "our result from the stacking analysis ( green filled star ) is in agreement with measurements by @xcite ( open triangles ) obtained in the direction of @xmath12-bright cygnus a. we emphasize that our result samples a widespread population detected from 19 sightlines , while @xcite examine only a single direction .",
    "our @xmath10 estimate is significantly higher than all other direct measurements shown here .",
    "the trend of increasing @xmath10 with increasing observational sensitivity confirms the expectation that previous experiments with lower sensitivity ( @xmath81 ) were unable to detect wnm with @xmath82 due to its low optical depth .",
    "the range of predicted _ kinetic _ temperatures from the most detailed ism heating and cooling considerations , shown by the dotted purple hatched region in figure  [ f : temp ] , is @xmath83@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we use models considering only collisional excitation from @xcite ( their figure 2 ) to show that under all plausible ism pressures , the range of spin temperatures implied by this @xmath14 range from @xcite , is @xmath84@xmath85 ( solid blue hatched region in figure  [ f : temp ] ) .",
    "our measurement indicates that the mean spin temperature of the wnm is higher than expected theoretically for collisionally excited hi at 98% confidence .",
    "resonant scattering of ly-@xmath1 photons can contribute enough to 21-cm excitation to allow @xmath86 , as long as a sufficient fraction of the ly-@xmath1 radiation permeates the wnm @xcite .",
    "however , the degree to which this can occur in a multi - phase ism depends on several observationally unconstrained quantities : the local and external ly-@xmath1 field , interstellar pressure , interstellar turbulence , ionization fraction , and the topology of the ism . using models from @xcite , which assume a column density of hydrogen nuclei equal to @xmath87 and the temperature of the ly-@xmath1 radiation field being equal to the kinetic temperature",

    "using monte carlo simulations , we have estimated the feature s spin temperature to be @xmath0 , which is significantly ( 98% confidence ) higher than theoretical predictions based on collisional excitation alone , likely due to the thermalization of hi by resonant ly-@xmath1 scattering .",
    "this work provides the first observational evidence that the ly-@xmath1 excitation mechanism is acting throughout the bulk of the galactic wnm , and demonstrates that the ly-@xmath1 radiation field , a quantity that is difficult to measure yet vitally important for interpreting hi signals from early epochs of cosmic structure formation , can be probed using measurements of the wnm .",
