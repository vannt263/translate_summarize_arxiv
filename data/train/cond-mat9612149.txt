    ", one can easily estimate how each susceptibility @xmath84 depends on the coupling strength @xmath1 , for both intraband and interband transitions .",
    "of most interest , one sees that the unscreened raman response function @xmath63 has an intraband contribution which is proportional @xmath85 and an interband contribution which is proportional @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the interband transitions dominate for the unscreened @xmath4-axis raman intensities when @xmath1 is small .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we first show the _ unscreened _ raman intensities for small @xmath87 at different temperatures .",
    "fixed parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 are used for all the results presented in this paper . to include the impurity scattering ,",
    "we then introduce the scattering rates @xmath90 into the green s functions in ( [ eq : g0 ] )    @xmath91    for simplicity , we will assume that the impurity scattering rates are equal for both bands ( @xmath92 ) and @xmath93 is linear in temperature ( @xmath94 at @xmath95 ) , but independent of frequency and momentum . as seen in fig",
    ".  [ fig2 ] , the @xmath4-axis raman spectra can exhibit clear signatures of a pseudogap , as long as the temperature is not too high . at high temperatures for which @xmath96 , the pseudogap feature is washed out by the impurity broadening .",

    "[ fig3 ] , we present the @xmath97 unscreened raman intensities for different coupling strengths .",
    "the inset shows that the unscreened @xmath4-axis raman intensity can , in general , be separated into an intraband and an interband contribution . for better clarity of presentation ,",
    "all intensities have been divided by @xmath86 .",
    "this leads to a almost constant interband contribution plus a intraband contribution proportional to @xmath86 .",
    "one finds at larger @xmath1 that the pseudogap feature arising from the interband transitions are overwhelmed by the increasing contribution of intraband transitions which tend to dominate the raman response .",

    "( [ eq : chi.screened.2 ] ) . due to the coulomb screening , the presence of the second ( mixing ) term in ( [ eq : chi.screened.2 ] ) results in the breakdown of the intraband and interband separation for the unscreened raman intensity . for comparison with figs .",

    "this result is valid for the small-@xmath1 case and can be established as follows .",

    "consequently , ( [ eq : chi.screened.2 ] ) can be reduced to a more elegant result    @xmath102    that is , the screening effects can be separated for each layer .",
    "however , the complete separation of intraband and interband contributions is still not possible because the intra- and interband parts ( both @xmath99 ) of @xmath103 are equally important ( although @xmath104 is dominated by the intraband transition ) .",
    "nevertheless , the mixing ( second ) term in ( [ eq : chi.screened.3 ] ) is proportional to @xmath85 and has only a small effect when @xmath1 is small .",
    "therefore , the unscreened interband transition given by @xmath63 still dominates . for higher values of @xmath1 , as used in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig3 ] , the coulomb screening has a large effect .",
    "in fact , in view of the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the coulomb screening effect tends to cancel against the unscreened interband contribution , largely leaving the unscreened intraband transition .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the @xmath4-axis raman spectra such that both the incident and scattered photon polarizations are parallel to the @xmath0-direction , for a plane - chain bilayer two - band cuprate .",
    "this coupled plane - chain model @xcite has given a natural explanation of pseudogaps @xcite seen in the ac @xmath4-axis optical conductivity .",
    "here we have shown in detail how one can also study pseudogaps by doing @xmath4-axis raman scattering .",
    "our calculations are based on a tight - binding model for the raman vertex .",
    "coulomb screening effects are treated properly and include both intralayer and interlayer coulomb interactions .",
    "when the coulomb screening is absent , the raman intensity can be separated into an intraband and an interband contribution . the interband contribution ( @xmath3 ) dominates in the small-@xmath1 limit .",
    "however , the presence of the coulomb screening mixes up this separation and the resulting intensities are strongly dependent on the magnitude of @xmath1 . nevertheless , when @xmath1 is small , the mixing effect arising from coulomb screening is small and , as a result , the interband unscreened transition still dominates .",
