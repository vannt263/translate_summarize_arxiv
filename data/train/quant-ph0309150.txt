    "recently a novel paradigm was suggested for the design of quantum algorithms for solving combinatorial search and optimization problems based on quantum adiabatic evolution @xcite . in the quantum adiabatic evolution algorithm ( qaa )",
    "a quantum state is closely following a ground state of a specially designed slowly time - varying control hamiltonian @xmath1 . at the beginning of the algorithm",
    "the control hamiltonian @xmath4 has a simple form with a known ground state that is easy to prepare , and at the final moment of time it coincides with the `` problem '' hamiltonian @xmath5 which ground state encodes the solution of the classical optimization problem in question @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a cost function defined on a set of @xmath8 binary strings @xmath9 @xmath10 , each containing @xmath0 bits .",
    "the summation in ( [ hp ] ) is over the @xmath8 states @xmath11 forming the computational basis of a quantum computer with @xmath0 qubits .",
    "state @xmath12 of the @xmath13-th qubit is an eigenstate of the pauli matrix @xmath14 with eigenvalue @xmath15 .",
    "if at the end of the qaa the quantum state is sufficiently close to the ground state of @xmath5 then the solution to the optimization problem can be retrieved by the measurement .",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite that the query complexity argument that lead to the exponential lower bound for the unstructured search @xcite can not be used to rule out the polynomial time solution of np - complete satisfiability problem by the quantum adiabatic evolution algorithm ( qaa ) .",
    "a set of examples of the 3-satisfiability problem has been recently constructed @xcite to test analytically the power of qaa . in these examples",
    "the cost function @xmath7 depends on a bit - string @xmath16 with @xmath0 bits , @xmath17 , only via a hamming weight of the string , @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 where the function @xmath20 is in general non - monotonic and defines a particular instance of this `` hamming weight problem '' ( hwp ) . in @xcite the original version of qaa @xcite",
    "was applied to the hwp where the control hamiltonian is a linear interpolation in time between the initial and final hamiltonians .    in this case , it was shown @xcite that the system can be trapped during the qaa in a local minimum of the cost function for a time that grows exponentially in the problem size @xmath0 . it was also shown @xcite that an exponential delay time in the quantum adiabatic algorithm can be interpreted in terms of the quantum - mechanical tunnelling of an auxiliary large spin between the two intermediate states .    the above example has a significance greater than just being a particular simplified case of a binary optimization problem with symmetrized cost .",
    "indeed , one can argue that it shows a generic mechanism for setting `` locality traps '' in the 3-satisfiability problem @xcite .",
    "but most importantly , this example demonstrates that exponential complexity of qaa can result from a _ collective phenomenon _ in which transitions between the configurations with low - lying energies can only occur by simultaneous flipping of large clusters containing order - n bits . in spin glasses",
    ", there is typically an exponential number of such configurations , the so - called local ground states",
    ". a similar picture may be applicable to random satisfiability problems @xcite . in some cases",
    ", these transitions can be understood and described in terms of macroscopic quantum tunnelling .",
    "a tunnelling of magnetization was observed in large - spin molecular nanomagnets @xcite and in disordered ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite suggests that large tunnelling barriers can be avoided in qaa by using multiple runs of qaa with realizations of the control hamiltonians @xmath1 sampled from a random ensemble .",
    "this ensemble is chosen in a sufficiently simple and general form that does not depend on the specific instance of the optimization problem .",
    "different hamiltonians @xmath1 correspond to different paths of the unitary evolution that begin and end in the same initial and final states ( modulus phase factors ) .",
    "the complexity of qaa with different paths for the hwp was tested numerically in @xcite using an ensemble of random 8@xmath218 matrices .",
    "the results indicate that the hwp may be solved in polynomial time with finite probability .    in case when the random paths @xmath1 preserve the bit - permutation symmetry of the problem it is natural to describe the random ensemble of @xmath22 in terms of the dynamics of a spin-@xmath3 system .",
    "this approach allows for a general theoretical analysis of the algorithm . in the present paper ,",
    "we perform this analysis for the random version of hwp ( over - constrained 3-satisfiability problem ) by mapping the dynamics of qaa onto the motion of a quantum particle in a 1d effective potential .",
    "this allows us to compute the statistical weight of the successful evolution paths in the ensemble and provide a complete characterization of such paths .",
    "in a qaa with different paths @xcite , one specifies the time - dependent control hamiltonian @xmath23 @xmath24 where the control parameter @xmath25 plays the role of dimensionless time .",
    "this hamiltonian guides the quantum evolution of the state vector @xmath26 according to the schrdinger equation @xmath27 from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , the _ run time _ of the algorithm .",
    "@xmath5 is the `` problem '' hamiltonian given in ( [ hp ] ) . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are ` driver' hamiltonians designed to cause the transitions between the eigenstates of @xmath5 .    an initial state of the system @xmath32 is prepared as a ground state of the initial hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "it is typically constructed assuming @xmath33 knowledge of the solution of the classical optimization problem and related ground state of @xmath5 . in the simplest case @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a pauli matrix for @xmath36-th qubit and @xmath37",
    "is some scaling constant .",

    "therefore a measurement performed on the quantum computer at @xmath51 will find one of the solutions of combinatorial optimization problem with large probability .",
    "quantum transition away from the adiabatic ground state occurs most likely in the vicinity of the point @xmath52 where the energy gap @xmath53 reaches its minimum ( avoided - crossing region ) .",
    "the probability of the transition is small provided that @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 ,   \\label{mingap1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the r.h.s . in eq .",
    "( [ mingap ] ) gives an upper bound estimate for the required runtime of the algorithm and the task is to find its asymptotic behavior in the limit of large @xmath56 .",
    "the numerator in ( [ mingap ] ) is of the order of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath57 , which typically scales polynomially with @xmath0 .",
    "however , @xmath58 can scale down exponentially with @xmath0 and in such cases the required runtime of the quantum adiabatic algorithm to find a solution grows exponentially fast with the size of the input .",
    "one should note that the second term in the r.h.s . of ( [ h_tot ] ) is zero at @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , by using different driver hamiltonians @xmath31 one can design a family of ( possibly random ) adiabatic evolution paths that start at @xmath59 in the same generically chosen initial state and arrive at the ground state of @xmath5 at @xmath60 . in general , different paths will correspond to different minimum gaps @xmath61 and one can introduce the distribution of minimum gaps .",
