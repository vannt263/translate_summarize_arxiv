    "in this paper we perform a detailed study of thermodynamics of a single classical particle confined to a spherical box filled in with an energy landscape described by a random gaussian function @xmath12 of @xmath13 real variables @xmath14 .",
    "although the problem is meaningful for any @xmath13 , we eventually will be mainly concerned with the limit of large @xmath15 where we will be able to develop a systematic method of analysis .",
    "in fact , it is well known that such simple yet non - trivial models play a role of a laboratory for developing the methods allowing one to deal with problems of statistical mechanics where an interplay between thermal fluctuations and those due to quenched disorder is essential .",
    "the paradigmatic example of systems of this sort are spin glasses @xcite , but similar effects are frequently operational for polymers behaviour in random environment , for phase separating interfaces in random field models or for elastic manifolds pinned by random impurities . in general , presence of quenched disorder leaves no choice but to employ the so - called replica trick , which is a heuristic way of extracting the averaged free energy of the system from moments of the partition function . the book @xcite may serve as a modern introduction to this problematic .",
    "both conceptual and technical difficulties of dealing with statistical mechanics of disordered systems stem from the fact that many features of their low temperature dynamics and thermodynamics are dominated by presence of a huge number of metastable states ( both minima and saddle points of various types ) in the energy functional in configuration space . at finite temperature",
    "those features may generate a complicated free energy landscape , and that structure is responsible both for unusual equilibrium properties ( an `` ergodicity breaking '' , see @xcite ) as well as for a complicated long - time dynamical behaviour .",
    "the latter manifests itself , in particular , through slow relaxation and aging effects @xcite . at the level of static properties the broken ergodicity",
    "is reflected in an intricate pattern of spontaneous replica symmetry breaking discovered originally by parisi @xcite in the framework of the sherrington - kirkpatrick @xcite model of spin glass with infinite - range interactions .",
    "attempts to relate that picture to the properties of stationary points of the corresponding free energy landscape started long ago from the pioneering tap paper@xcite and is still a rather active field of research , see e.g. @xcite and references therein for a general account , and @xcite for a treatment of the model of the present type .    in this broad context , the model of a single particle in a random potential has played an important role in physics of disordered system .",
    "it has enjoyed quite a long history of research starting from early works by mezard and parisi @xcite , and engel @xcite on static properties of such a system , followed by franz and mezard @xcite and cugliandolo and le doussal @xcite papers on the corresponding dynamics . to have bona fide thermodynamics one has to ensure that the partition function @xmath16 of the model is well - defined for any realization of the random potential .",
    "this is usually achieved by introducing a sort of a confining potential @xmath17 which prohibits escape of the particle to infinity .",
    "the standard choice is to use a parabolic potential uniform in all directions @xmath18 .",
    "the curvature @xmath19 then plays together with the temperature @xmath20 a role of the main control parameter of the system , and one of standard goals of the theory is to investigate the phase diagram in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "technically , the problem amounts to calculating the ensemble average of the equilibrium free energy @xmath21 .",
    "the replica trick allows one to represent integer moments @xmath22 of the partition function in a form of some multivariable non - gaussian integrals , and one then faces the usual problem of finding ways of evaluating those integrals for need of performing the replica limit @xmath23 .",
    "the crucial step allowing one to achieve further progress was suggested by mezard and parisi @xcite and is widely known as the gaussian variational ansatz ( gva ) .",
    "loosely speaking , it amounts to replacing the non - gaussian integrands with trial gaussian ones and employing the feynman - bogoliubov variational procedure to find best possible gaussian approximation to the true free energy in the replica limit , see @xcite for a detailed discussion . proceeding in this way , it turned out to be possible to employ again the parisi scheme of spontaneous replica symmetry breaking at the level of the trial free energy , and to reveal the glassy nature of the lower - temperature phase of the model .",
    "since its induction gva method became one of the most popular tools of dealing with quenched disorder .",
    "it allowed not only to get useful insights into static properties of glassy systems of quite a diverse nature ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but was eventually adopted to study the corresponding nonequilibrium dynamics as well @xcite .",
    "such a flexibility of gva is based on the fact that it can be formally applied in any dimension @xmath13 .",
    "the accumulated experience shows that the physical quantities calculated in such a way usually agree well with the results of numerical simulations on qualitative , and sometimes even quantitative level . as a result",
    ", gva presently serves as a standard reference point for comparison with any new approach to the problem , as e.g. with a recently developed functional renormalization group method @xcite .",
    "one should nevertheless recall that the exploitation of gva lacks formal mathematical justification for finite dimensions . to this end ,",
    "mezard and parisi provided an argument@xcite , see also @xcite , that being a variant of the hartree - fock approach the method should actually yield exact results in the limit @xmath24 .",
    "another intrinsic feature of gva is that the whole procedure is essentially based on a possibility to evaluate explicitly some intermediate gaussian integrals . for the models defined in a restricted geometry presence of a geometric confinement may make applications of gva less convenient",
    "this is precisely the case for the class of models to be treated in the present paper : a particle confined to an impenetrable spherical box of some finite radius @xmath25 filled with a gaussian random potential . to make contact with previous works on the problem we retain also the parabolic confinement term , so that our model is characterised by both @xmath3 and @xmath26 as control parameters",
    "our main technical observation is that the model is exactly solvable for any value of those parameters in the limit @xmath27 without any need of introducing gva .",
    "rather , our method is based on observing that the replicated partition function possesses a high degree of invariance in the replica space : an arbitrary simultaneous @xmath28 rotation of all @xmath29 replica vectors @xmath30 .",
    "an efficient method of dealing with such integrals was developed recently in the work of one of the authors @xcite within the framework of the theory of random matrices .",
    "this method allows us to arrive to the effective free energy functional in the replica space in the most economic , and we believe elegant way .",
    "the subsequent analysis follows the standard route of using the parisi ansatz for the spontaneous replica symmetry breaking pattern , and the nature of the low - temperature phase is known to depend very much on the decay properties of the covariance function of the disorder potential@xcite .",
    "actually , we propose a simple mathematical criterion which allows one to formally discriminate between the long - ranged and short - ranged disorder , and also suggests to single out potentials with logarithmically growing correlations as a separate intermediate class .",
    "for all types of the disorder we provide a detailed derivation of the free energy functional , the stability analysis , and a thorough description of the most important features of the resulting phase diagram .",
    "the latter undergoes considerable modifications reflecting a competition between the confinement provided by the radius @xmath3 and the curvature of the parabolic potential @xmath26 . for the limiting case of infinite confinement radius",
    "our results faithfully reproduce all those following from earlier applications of gva .",
    "this is just another explicit verification of the expected exactness of gva in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "one more point we find appropriate to mention here is that the parisi scenario of replica symmetry breaking for spin glass models is changing presently its status from a powerful heuristic method of theoretical physics to an essentially rigorous mathematical procedure , well - controlled in the case of models of infinite range .",
    "this important change is mainly due to recent seminal results by talagrand @xcite , based on earlier works by guerra @xcite , see also interesting works by aizenman , sims and starr @xcite .",
    "in particular , talagrand was able to demonstrate that the equilibrium free energy emerging naturally in the parisi scheme of replica symmetry breaking is indeed the correct thermodynamic limit of the free energy of the paradigmatic sherrington - kirkpatrick model and , more recently , for the so - called spherical model of spin glasses , originally studied by one of the present authors in @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect that similar justification should be possible also for other types of models with glassy thermodynamics , the model of a particle in random potential being the most natural candidate .",
    "however , the solution of the problem in the framework of gva does not seem to be a promising starting point for such a verification . on the other hand ,",
    "the expression for the free energy emerging in our approach is actually very close in its form to those emerging in the spherical model of spin glasses ( see discussion in the end of the next section ) .",
    "the revealed similarities of our problem to the spherical spin glass model give strong evidence in favour of applicability of talagrand s method for the model under consideration .",
    "we leave a detailed investigation of this issue for a future work .",
    "finally , we hope that our presentation has also a certain pedagogical value by providing extended description of a few technical details known to experts , but which are not always easy to find in the existing literature .",
    "as was discussed in the introduction , we consider a classical particle confined to an impenetrable spherical box of some finite size @xmath31 .",
    "to ensure the non - trivial behaviour in the limit @xmath24 , one has to scale the radius of the sphere with @xmath13 , and we denote the corresponding domain as @xmath32 .",
    "of such a sphere in the large @xmath13 limit behaves asymptotically as @xmath33 . ]    as usual , the main object of interest for us is to calculate the ensemble average of the free energy @xmath34 where @xmath35 stands for the inverse temperature .",
    "the average of the logarithm over the disorder ( denoted in the present paper by angular brackets ) is performed with the help of the standard replica trick , i.e. the formal identity @xmath36    the standard choice of the energy function for this problem is @xmath37 with @xmath19 .",
    "a random gaussian - distributed potential @xmath38 is characterized by zero mean and the variance specified by the pair correlation function which we choose in the form ensuring stationarity : @xmath39    the previous analysis @xcite revealed that one should essentially distinguish between two rather different situations .",
    "the first describes the case of a short - range correlated disorder corresponding to functions @xmath40 vanishing at infinity , with @xmath41 being a typical representative of that class . in the second case",
    "the correlations are long ranged , and at large distances the potential grows in such a way that : @xmath42 ^ 2\\right\\rangle\\propto \\left({\\bf x}_1-{\\bf x}_2\\right)^{2\\gamma},\\ ] ] the exponent @xmath43 to be chosen in the range @xmath44 .",
    "the particular case @xmath45 corresponds to a potential @xmath38 being the standard brownian motion .",
    "although formally @xmath38 in the latter case can not satisfy the property eq.([2 ] ) as its variance @xmath46 is obviously position - dependent , one can easily satisfy oneself that such a difference is completely immaterial for the free energy calculations . as a result",
    ", we always assume for the long - ranged disorder the validity of eq.([2 ] ) with the choice : @xmath47    in what follows we will be able to formulate a certain criterium relating the nature of the low - temperature glassy phase of the model with the shape of the correlation functions @xmath40 , see eq.([con5 ] ) and the discussion around it . according to that criterium , in a broad class of random potentials with short - range correlations",
    "the glassy phase will be described by the so - called one - step replica symmetry breaking ( 1rsb ) , whereas all long - ranged potentials eq([2b ] ) are characterized by the full replica symmetry breaking ( frsb ) .",
    "the criterium also suggests naturally to single - out as a special case the logarithmically growing correlations , that is @xmath48 we shall see that such a choice leads to the phase diagram which combines some features typical for the short - ranged behaviour and others for the long - ranged types of disorder . in this sense",
    "the logarithmically growing correlations should be considered as a marginal case intermediate between the two broad classes described above .",
    "it is interesting to mention that the choice of a glassy model with logarithmically growing correlations eq.([2c ] ) is not purely academic , as such objects actually emerge e.g. in a context of statistics of the wave function in disordered two - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "actually , a few initial steps in evaluation of the free energy are precisely the same for all types of disorder , provided the latter is of the gaussian nature . performing the averaging over the disorder in eq.([replica ] ) , we in the standard way arrive at the following expression : @xmath49 where @xmath50 so far all our manupulations were exact . to achieve further progress one has to suggest an efficient way of working with the resulting multidimensional integral . in the standard model with infinite box radius @xmath2",
    "mezard and parisi@xcite suggested to deal with apparently non - gaussian character of the integrand by replacing the exact replicated hamiltonian @xmath51 with a trial hamiltonian @xmath52 chosen to be gaussian with respect to all variables @xmath53 , and then to apply a kind of variational principle to find the best possible gaussian approximation .",
    "here we point out the possibility of a different route , valid for any value of the parameter @xmath3 and requiring at this step no approximation .",
    "it is based on observing that the integrand in eq.([replica1 ] ) in fact possesses a high degree of invariance : it depends on @xmath54component vectors @xmath53 only via @xmath55 scalar products @xmath56 , and is therefore invariant with respect to an arbitrary simultaneous @xmath28 rotation of all vectors @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , our choice of the integration domain respects this invariance .",
    "an efficient method of dealing with such integrals is based on the possibility of rewriting the integral @xmath58 whose integrand @xmath59 possesses such type of invariance in an alternative form as @xmath60 provided @xmath61 . here in eq.([trans1 ] ) the original integrand @xmath62 is expressed as a function @xmath63 of @xmath64 real symmetric positive semidefinite matrix @xmath65 whose entries are precisely those @xmath66 , introduced above . the integration domain @xmath67 is simply @xmath68 , the volume element is @xmath69 and the proportionality constant is given explicitly by @xmath70 although some use of similar formulae in statistical mechanics can be traced back to @xcite , the full potential of the transformation from eq.([defint ] ) to eq.([trans1 ] ) seems to be revealed in the work of one of the authors @xcite where it was rediscovered in the context of random matrix theory using ingham - siegel matrix integrals . since",
    "then the formula found applications in physics of disordered systems , see e.g @xcite for an elegant derivation and further use .    applying this procedure to our case and using the subsequent rescaling @xmath71 yields the following exact expression for the averaged replicated partition function : @xmath72 where @xmath73\\ ] ] and @xmath13 is assumed to satisfy the constraint @xmath74 .",
    "the final integration domain @xmath75 is already @xmath54independent : @xmath76 .",
    "the form of the integrand in eq.([replica2 ] ) is precisely one required for the possibility of evaluating the replicated partition function in the limit @xmath27 by the laplace ( `` saddle - point '' ) method limit , one can in principle follow a different route .",
    "namely , impose @xmath55 constraints @xmath77 through the integral fourier representations involving @xmath55 auxiliary fields @xmath78 , and take the saddle - point both in @xmath79 and @xmath80 variables . the same asymptotic result eq.([repfreeen ] ) then follows after simple manipulations .",
    "we however believe that the use of the elegant mathematical procedure based on eq.([trans1 ] ) is more conceptually clear , and appealing aesthetically .",
    "we hope that it may also provide a useful basis for calculating @xmath81 corrections , and perhaps for a rigorous mathematical treatment of the problem . ] .",
    "taking into account the expressions eqs.([freendef ] ) , ( [ replica ] ) , and ( [ const ] ) the free energy of our model is then given by @xmath82 where the entries of the matrix @xmath83 are chosen to satisfy the conditions : @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "this yields , in general , the system of @xmath55 equations : @xmath86_{aa}-\\beta\\sum_{b(\\ne a)}^n f'\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(q_{aa}+q_{bb})-q_{ab}\\right]=0,\\quad a=1,2,\\ldots , n\\ ] ] and @xmath87_{ab}+\\beta f'\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(q_{aa}+q_{bb})-q_{ab}\\right]=0,\\quad a\\ne b\\ ] ] where @xmath88 stands for the derivative @xmath89 .",
    "one should also ensure that the solutions to these equations respects the constraint @xmath90 for all @xmath91 imposed by presence of the boundaries of the integration domain @xmath75 .",
    "we will shortly see that in the replica limit @xmath23 that condition will be violated for some regions of parameters @xmath92 .",
    "if this happens , eqs.([sp1 ] ) should be simply replaced by equalities @xmath93 , and the solution to the remaining set eq.([sp2 ] ) should be sought with those constraints imposed .",
    "one then notices that for @xmath94 the resulting expression for the free energy formally coincides , up to a trivial constant term , with that obtained for the so - called `` spherical '' mean field model of spin glasses .",
    "various features of the latter model attracted a lot of research interest in recent years , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between the free energies of the two models which is so apparent in our approach deserves a short comment . in one of its recent incarnations the hamiltonian @xmath95 of the spherical model",
    "was defined as @xcite @xmath96 in terms of @xmath54component vectors @xmath97 spanning the sphere of radius @xmath98 . here",
    "@xmath99 denote independent gaussian variables with mean zero and unit variance .",
    "the original version @xcite of the same model can be shown to yield precisely the same free energy in the thermodynamic limit@xcite .",
    "immediate consequence of the definition eq.([spherical ] ) is that the correlation function @xmath100 depends on the vectors @xmath101 and @xmath102 only via the scalar product @xmath103 .",
    "this is precisely the property sufficient to ensure global @xmath28 invariance of the replicated partition function of the model , and our method of deriving the mean free energy goes through without any modifications , and may well be the shortest possible .",
    "the spherical constraint @xmath104 simply translates into the condition @xmath94 .",
    "our procedure of investigating the equations eqs.([sp1],[sp2 ] ) in the replica limit @xmath23 will follow the standard pattern suggested by developments in spin glass theory .",
    "we first seek for the so - called `` replica symmetric '' solution , and then investigate its stability in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "when the replica symmetric solution is found inadequate , it will be replaced by the hierarchical ( `` parisi '' , or `` ultrametric '' ) ansatz for the matrix elements @xmath66 , with various levels of replica symmetry breaking .",
    "since the full analysis contains a lot of features to be explained in detail , the reader may wish to cast a regular look at the resulting phase diagrams fig1 , fig.2 and fig.3 in the process of reading .",
    "the replica symmetric ansatz amounts to searching for a solution to eqs.([sp1],[sp2 ] ) within subspace of matrices @xmath83 such that @xmath105 , for any @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , subject to the constraints @xmath108 .",
    "inverting such a matrix @xmath83 yields again the matrix of the same structure , with the diagonal entries all given by @xmath109 and off - diagonal entries given by @xmath110 note , that @xmath111 the system eqs.([sp1],[sp2 ] ) is reduced in this way to two equations , which we write directly in the replica limit @xmath23 as @xmath112 @xmath113 this system of equations is easy to solve employing the relation ( [ invsym ] ) , and to obtain @xmath114 in order this solution to be sensible one first of all has to require @xmath115 , which we always assume to hold in our model .",
    "in addition , the solution eq.([qsym ] ) can hold only as long as @xmath116 , which in view of the above expressions amounts to the condition @xmath117 when the above inequality is violated , we should rather use @xmath118 , and find @xmath119 from the `` spherical model '' type equation @xmath120 following immediately from eqs.([sp2sym],[invsym2 ] ) .",
    "let us briefly discuss general properties of the boundary line @xmath121 separating the `` @xmath122dominated '' regime from the `` r - dominated '' one in @xmath6 plane , for a fixed value of the confining radius @xmath3 .",
    "for a given value of @xmath26 the value of @xmath123 is obtained by solving the equation @xmath124 when analysing this equation we shall assume in addition to the condition @xmath115 two more conditions : the uniform concavity condition @xmath125 as well as the condition @xmath126 .",
    "sensibility of that choice will be justified by analysis of patterns of spontaneous replica symmetry breaking in subsequent sections , see discussions around eq.([con5 ] ) .",
    "we also assume that @xmath127 for large @xmath128 , as is indeed the case for all types of disorder in the original model .    for the short - range disorder the values @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "it is convenient to define for subsequent use two quantities @xmath131 then a simple graphical analysis of eq.([rboundsym ] ) shows that for @xmath132 that equation has a single solution @xmath121 tending asymptotically to @xmath133 for @xmath134 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath135 the number of solutions essentially depends on the value of the confining radius @xmath3 . defining @xmath136 as in eq.([rcr ] )",
    ", we find that for @xmath137 the condition @xmath138 implies that no such solution @xmath123 exists at all .",
    "this fact corresponds to the picture of monotonically increasing curve @xmath121 starting from the point @xmath139 in the @xmath6 plane . in the opposite case @xmath140",
    "there are two solutions @xmath141 in the whole interval @xmath142 , with @xmath143 as @xmath144 .",
    "the value of @xmath145 and the corresponding temperature value @xmath146 can be found as @xmath147 with @xmath148 being the solution of the equation @xmath149 note , that @xmath150 ^ 2>0 $ ] according to our assumptions .",
    "thus , the right - hand side of eq.([tau0 ] ) is a monotonously increasing function , and thus the equation has a ( unique ) solution @xmath151 as long as @xmath152 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath137 the equation eq.([tau0 ] ) has no solutions .",
    "finally , for @xmath153 the equation ( [ rboundsym ] ) has no more solutions .    relegating similar analysis of the long - ranged as well as the logarithmic correlations to the end of the section",
    ", we now discuss the last important ingredient of the procedure : the issue of the stability of the emerging solution against fluctuations in the replica space .",
    "indeed , the very essence of the saddle - point method calls for a check of the replica symmetric solution being locally stable , in the sense of corresponding to the true extremum ( in the replica limit @xmath23 , to a maximum ) of the functional @xmath154 .",
    "this should be judged by analysing the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath155 at this solution .",
    "such analysis along the lines of the classical de - almeida and thouless ( at ) paper@xcite is presented in the appendix b.",
    "the main outcome is that the @xmath26-dominated replica symmetric solution eq.([qsym ] ) is locally stable as long as @xmath156 whereas the `` spherical model''-type solution satisfying eq.([rdominsym ] ) is stable provided @xmath157 combining the latter with eq.([rdominsym ] ) for @xmath119 one easily finds that the domain of the replica - symmetric stability in the r - dominated regime is given by @xmath158 where @xmath148 is precisely the solution of eq.([tau0 ] ) .",
    "we will see shortly that both conditions eq.([atmu ] ) and eq([atr ] ) could be violated for low enough values of @xmath26 and @xmath20 below the so - called de - almeida - thouless line @xmath159 . actually , in the @xmath160dominated region of the phase diagram such a line is parallel to the @xmath122axis , as the solution @xmath148 of eq.([tau0 ] ) determining the right - hand side of ( [ atr ] ) depends only on @xmath3 and hence is @xmath122 independent .",
    "in particular ,",
    "for the limiting case @xmath161 the expression for the whole de - almeida - thouless line in @xmath162 plane is just @xmath163 ( see e.g fig.4(c ) for a particular choice of the short - ranged potential ) .",
    "let us see how these features are incorporated into the analysis of the boundary @xmath121 between the @xmath26-dominated and the @xmath160dominated regions performed by us above . in the case of a short - range disorder with @xmath130 studied above we can easily see that the de - almeida thouless line @xmath159 given by the equality sign in eq.([atmu ] ) must end up for zero temperature at the point @xmath164 . as a simple consequence , for small confining radius @xmath137 , with @xmath136 again given by eq.([rcr ] )",
    ", the whole instability region falls outside the domain of validity of @xmath26-dominated solution . to find whether the replica - symmetric solution is stable one therefore has to use instead the equation given by the equality sign in eq.([atspherical ] ) . as the latter equation actually does not have at all roots for @xmath137",
    ", we conclude that for the present model the replica symmetric solution is always stable for such values of the confining radius @xmath3 . in short ,",
    "the small box size @xmath137 precludes possibility of the replica symmetry breaking , hence the glassy behaviour of the models with short - ranged correlations , see fig.3a appeared in the analysis of the `` geometric complexity '' associated with the zero - temperature limit of the present model . namely , the samples with @xmath137 were found to be unable to support the existence of exponentially many saddle points in their energy landscape .",
    "such an existence seems to be a necessary feature of a phase with glassy behaviour@xcite . ]",
    "the situation changes crucially for @xmath140 .",
    "first of all , now the lines @xmath121 and the at line @xmath159 can indeed intersect each other in @xmath165 plane . curiously enough , the point of intersection turns out to coincide with the point @xmath166 , see eq.([mu0 ] ) , which emerged in the previous analysis as the `` leftmost '' point on the curve @xmath121 , such that for @xmath153 the equation ( [ rboundsym ] ) has no solutions . for @xmath167",
    "the branch @xmath168 drops therefore below the at line and hence has no meaning . at the same time for another branch @xmath169 and",
    "hence that solution survives .",
    "we shall see in subsequent sections that our analysis of the phase with broken replica symmetry will provide us with a modified expression for the boundary line @xmath170 extending from the point @xmath166 down to zero temperature .    for @xmath153",
    "we are in the domain of validity of the r - dominated solution , and the corresponding at temperature should be given by @xmath122 independent value @xmath171 from eq.([atr ] ) .",
    "the latter expression now makes full sense as the corresponding solution @xmath148 indeed exists .",
    "finally , in view of eq.([mu0 ] ) it is evident that the @xmath122 independent value of @xmath171 is simply @xmath172 everywhere in r - dominated phase , so that the r - dominated and @xmath122 dominated at lines indeed meet each other at the same point @xmath166 of the phase diagram , as was natural to expect .",
    "so far our analysis assumed the case of a short - range disorder .",
    "for the case of long - ranged disorder , eq.([2b ] ) , the overall structure of the line @xmath121 is in many respects similar , but has some peculiarities .",
    "in particular , there will be no analogue of the critical value of the confinement radius @xmath173 in this case .",
    "below we proceed in presenting a brief analysis of the situation for any value of the exponent @xmath174 . using @xmath175 , the equation eq.([rdomsym ] ) for the boundary line @xmath121 between the @xmath122dominated and spherical model like regions in the @xmath6 diagram can be written as @xmath176 we see that the function @xmath177 has its single minimum for @xmath178 at @xmath179 , and @xmath180 .",
    "hence , the equation @xmath181 has two positive solutions @xmath182 as long as @xmath183 , and no solutions if @xmath184 .",
    "then a simple calculation shows that two branches @xmath141 exist as long as @xmath185 at @xmath186 those two branches merge : @xmath187 which implies @xmath188 .",
    "the corresponding characteristic temperature can be found as @xmath189 finally , we should take the presence of the de almeida - thouless conditions eqs.([atmu],[atr ] ) into consideration .",
    "recall that for the case of a long - ranged disorder @xmath190 in contrast to the finite value typical for the short - range case . as a consequence ,",
    "the at line now extends in the @xmath6 plane to arbitrary large values of @xmath26 and is explicitly given by the equation @xmath191^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma-2}}}\\,.\\ ] ] it is now easy to verify that the boundary line @xmath121 which is given for @xmath192 by the two branches @xmath168 and @xmath193 intersects at line precisely at the point @xmath166 , with @xmath194 .",
    "moreover , one can check that @xmath195 for @xmath167 .",
    "this simply implies that @xmath196 for any @xmath167 .",
