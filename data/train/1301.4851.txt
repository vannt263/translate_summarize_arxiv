    "this paper is mostly an expository survey , centered on the topology of complements of hyperplane arrangements , their milnor fibrations , and their boundary structures .",
    "the presentation is loosely based on a set of notes for a mini - course given at the conference ",
    "arrangements in pyrnes \" , held in pau , france in june 2012 . although we expanded the scope of those notes , and provided many more details and explanations , we made every effort to maintain the original spirit of the lectures , which was to give a brisk , self - contained introduction to the subject , and provide motivation for further study .",
    "an arrangement is a finite collection of hyperplanes in a finite - dimensional , complex vector space .",
    "there are various ways to understand the topology of such an object . in this paper , we describe several topological spaces associated to a hyperplane arrangement , all connected to each other by means of inclusions , bundle maps , or covering projections . associated to these spaces , there is a plethora of topological invariants of an algebraic nature : fundamental group and lower central series , betti numbers and torsion coefficients , cohomology ring and massey products , characteristic and resonance varieties , and so on .",
    "one of the main goals of the subject is to decide whether a given invariant is combinatorially determined , and , if so , to express it explicitly in terms of the intersection lattice of the arrangement .",
    "as the title indicates , the focus of the paper is on the milnor fibration of the complement of a hyperplane arrangement .",
    "we use cohomology with coefficients in rank @xmath0 local systems on the complement to compute the homology groups of the milnor fiber , with coefficients in a field not dividing the number of hyperplanes , and determine the characteristic polynomial of the monodromy operator acting on these homology groups . in the process , we also show how to compute various homological invariants of the boundary of the complement and the boundary of the milnor fiber .      given an arrangement @xmath1 in @xmath2 , the most direct approach is to study the complement , @xmath3 .",
    "the fundamental group of this space can be computed algorithmically , using the braid monodromy associated to a generic plane section .",
    "the cohomology ring of the complement was computed by brieskorn in @xcite .",
    "his result shows that @xmath4 is a formal space ; in particular , all rational massey products vanish . in @xcite ,",
    "orlik and solomon gave a simple combinatorial description of the algebra @xmath5 : it is the quotient of the exterior algebra on classes dual to the meridians , modulo a certain ideal determined by the intersection lattice , @xmath6 .",
    "a comprehensive treatment of this topic can be found in @xcite .",
    "starting in the mid - to - late 1990s , the subject underwent a considerable shift of emphasis towards the study of the cohomology jump loci of the complement .",
    "these loci come in two basic flavors : the characteristic varieties , which are the jump loci for cohomology with coefficients in complex , rank one local systems , and the resonance varieties , which are the jump loci for the homology of the cochain complexes arising from multiplication classes in @xmath7 .",
    "since the complement of the arrangement is a smooth , quasi - projective variety , its characteristic varieties are finite unions of torsion - translates of algebraic subtori of the character group @xmath8 .",
    "since the complement is a formal space , the resonance varieties of @xmath4 coincide with the tangent cone at the origin to the corresponding characteristic varieties , and thus are finite unions of rationally defined linear subspaces of @xmath7 .    for the degree-@xmath0 resonance varieties ,",
    "these subspaces were described combinatorially by libgober and yuzvinsky @xcite , and later by falk and yuzvinsky @xcite , solely in terms of multinets on sub - arrangements of @xmath1 . in general , though , the degree-@xmath0 characteristic varieties of an arrangement may contain components which do not pass through the origin , and it is still an open problem whether such components are combinatorially determined .",
    "the characteristic and resonance varieties of an arrangement complement may also be defined for ( algebraically closed ) fields of positive characteristic .",
    "the nature of these varieties is less predictable , though .",
    "for instance , as noted in @xcite , both the tangent cone formula and the linearity of the resonance components fail in this setting .",
    "furthermore , as shown in @xcite , non - vanishing massey triple products may appear in positive characteristic .",
    "a more refined topological invariant of an arrangement @xmath1 is the milnor fibration of its complement . for each hyperplane @xmath9",
    ", choose a linear form @xmath10 whose kernel is @xmath11 .",
    "the polynomial @xmath12 , then , is homogeneous of degree @xmath13 . as shown by milnor @xcite in a more general context ,",
    "the restriction @xmath14 is a smooth fibration . the typical fiber , @xmath15 ,",
    "is called the milnor fiber of the arrangement .",
    "we give a topological description of this fibration , building on previous joint work with cohen and denham @xcite .",
    "it turns out that @xmath16 is a regular , cyclic @xmath17-fold cover of the projectivized complement , @xmath18 .",
    "the classifying homomorphism for this cover , @xmath19 , takes each meridian generator to @xmath0 .",
    "embedding @xmath20 into @xmath21 by sending @xmath0 to a primitive @xmath17-th root of unity , we may view @xmath22 as a character on @xmath23 .",
    "the relative position of this character with respect to the characteristic varieties of @xmath24 determines the betti numbers of the milnor fiber @xmath16 , as well as the characteristic polynomial of the algebraic monodromy .",
    "more generally , given multiplicities @xmath25 for each hyperplane @xmath26 , we consider the milnor fibration of the multi - arrangement @xmath27 , defined by the homogeneous polynomial @xmath28 .",
    "the milnor fiber of this polynomial is now a regular , @xmath29-fold cyclic cover of the complement , where @xmath29 is the sum of the multiplicities .",
    "not too surprisingly , the betti numbers and other topological invariants of the milnor fiber @xmath30 vary with the choice of @xmath31 .",
    "although the complement of an arrangement and its milnor fiber share some common features ( for instance , they are both smooth , quasi - projective varieties ) , there are some striking differences between the two . for one , the homology groups of the milnor fiber need not be torsion - free , as recent examples from @xcite show . for another , the milnor fiber may have non - vanishing massey products , and thus be non - formal , as examples from @xcite show . finally ,",
    "as noted in @xcite , the cohomology jump loci of the milnor fiber may differ from those of the complement .",
    "all these novel qualitative features are related to the nature of multinets supported by the arrangement in question , or one of its sub - arrangements .",
    "both the projectivized complement and the milnor fiber of an arrangement are non - compact manifolds ( without boundary ) .",
    "replacing these spaces by their compact versions allows us to study the behavior of the complement and the milnor fibration as we approach the boundary , thereby revealing otherwise hidden phenomena .    cutting off a regular neighborhood of the arrangement @xmath1 yields a compact manifold with boundary , @xmath32 , onto which @xmath24 deform - retracts .",
    "the boundary manifold of the arrangement , then , is the smooth , compact , orientable @xmath33-dimensional manifold @xmath34 .",
    "the homology groups are torsion - free , and the ring @xmath35 is functorially determined by @xmath36 , via a  doubling \" construction .    especially interesting",
    "is the case @xmath37 , when the manifold @xmath34 is a graph - manifold , in the sense of waldhausen . following the approach from @xcite , we describe the fundamental group , the cohomology ring , and the cohomology jump loci of @xmath34 in terms of the underlying graph structure , which in turn can be read off the intersection lattice of @xmath1 . yet",
    "significant differences with the complement exist .",
    "for one , the boundary manifold is never formal , unless @xmath1 is a pencil or a near - pencil .",
    "for another , the resonance varieties of @xmath34 may have non - linear components .",
    "intersecting now the milnor fiber with a ball in @xmath2 centered at the origin yields a compact manifold with boundary , @xmath38 , onto which @xmath16 deform - retracts .",
    "the boundary of the milnor fiber , then , is the smooth , compact , orientable @xmath33-dimensional manifold @xmath39 .",
    "we observe here that @xmath39 is a regular , cyclic @xmath17-fold cover of @xmath34 , where @xmath13 , and identify a classifying homomorphism for this cover .",
    "when @xmath37 , the boundary of @xmath38 is a @xmath40-dimensional graph - manifold . using work of nmethi and szilrd @xcite , we give a formula for the characteristic polynomial of the monodromy operator acting on @xmath41 , purely in terms of the mbius function of @xmath42 .",
    "we also show that the manifold @xmath39 is never formal , unless @xmath1 is a pencil or a near - pencil , and point out that @xmath43 typically has non - trivial @xmath17-torsion .",
    "the paper is divided roughly into three parts , following the approach outlined so far in this introduction .    the first part deals with the complement of a hyperplane arrangement @xmath1 . in ",
    "[ sect : ma1 ] , we discuss the combinatorics of @xmath1 , as it relates to the cohomology ring and resonance varieties of the complement , with special emphasis on multinets . in  [ sect : ma2 ] , we study the topology of @xmath44 , as reflected in the fundamental group and characteristic varieties , with special emphasis on orbifold fibrations and translated subtori in those varieties .",
    "the second part covers the milnor fibration defined by a multi - arrangement . in  [ sect : mf arr ] we set up in all detail the regular covers into which the corresponding milnor fiber fits . in  [ sect : mf bis ] , we study the homology of the milnor fiber and the monodromy action , and discuss the formality properties and the cohomology jump loci of the milnor fiber .",
    "the third part deals with the boundary structures associated to an arrangement . in ",
    "[ sect : boundary ] we discuss the boundary manifold of an arrangement , while in  [ sect : bdry mf ] we discuss the boundary of the milnor fiber .    sprinkled throughout the text",
    "there are about two dozen open problems .",
    "most of these problems have been raised before ; some are well - known , but some appear here for the first time .",
    "we collect the necessary background material in three appendices at the end .",
    "appendix [ sect : cvs ] serves as a quick introduction to the cohomology jump loci of a space , and some of their properties .",
    "appendix [ sect : covers ] deals with the homology groups and jump loci of finite , regular abelian covers of a space .",
    "finally , appendix [ sect : formal ] discusses formality properties of spaces , especially as they pertain to finite covers and jump loci .",
    "i wish to thank the organizers of the arrangements in pyrnes conference for giving me the opportunity to lecture in such a wonderful setting , and for their support and hospitality .",
    "i also wish to thank the university of sydney for its support and hospitality while most of this paper was written up .",
    "in this section we describe the cohomology ring and the resonance varieties of the complement of a complex hyperplane arrangement .",
    "an _ arrangement of hyperplanes _ is a finite set @xmath1 of codimension-@xmath0 linear subspaces in a finite - dimensional , complex vector space @xmath2 . throughout",
    ", we will assume that the arrangement is central , that is , all the hyperplanes pass through the origin .",
    "the combinatorics of the arrangement is encoded in its _ intersection lattice _ , @xmath6 ; this is the poset of all intersections of @xmath1 , ordered by reverse inclusion , and ranked by codimension .",

    "let @xmath46 be a linear form with kernel @xmath11 .",
    "the product @xmath47 then , is a defining polynomial for the arrangement , unique up to a ( non - zero ) constant factor .",
    "notice that @xmath48 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree equal to @xmath49 , the cardinality of the set @xmath1 .    on occasion",
    ", we will allow multiplicities on the hyperplanes .",
    "multi - arrangement _ is a pair @xmath27 , where @xmath1 is a hyperplane arrangement , and @xmath50 is a function with @xmath51 for each @xmath52 .",
    "we may also assign multiplicities to subspaces @xmath53 , by letting @xmath54 .",
    "a defining polynomial for the multi - arrangement @xmath27 is the homogeneous polynomial @xmath55      the main topological invariant associated to an arrangement @xmath1 is its complement , @xmath56 .",
    "this is a smooth , quasi - projective variety , with the homotopy type of a connected , finite cw - complex of dimension @xmath57 .",
    "[ ex : boolean ] the boolean arrangement @xmath58 consists of the coordinate hyperplanes @xmath59 in @xmath60 .",

    "[ ex : config ] the reflection arrangement of type @xmath63 , also known as the braid arrangement , consists of the diagonal hyperplanes @xmath64 in @xmath60 .",
    "the intersection lattice is the lattice of partitions of @xmath65=\\set{1,\\dots , n}$ ] , ordered by refinement .",
    "the complement is the configuration space @xmath66 of @xmath17 ordered points in @xmath67 . in the early 1960s , fox and",
    "neuwirth showed that @xmath68 , the pure braid group on @xmath17 strings , while neuwirth and fadell showed that @xmath66 is aspherical .",
    "the group @xmath21 acts freely on @xmath69 via @xmath70 .",
    "the orbit space is the complex projective space of dimension @xmath71 , while the orbit map , @xmath72 , @xmath73 $ ] , is the hopf fibration .",
    "the set @xmath74 is an arrangement of codimension @xmath0 projective subspaces in @xmath75 ; its complement , @xmath76 , coincides with the quotient @xmath77 .",
    "the hopf map restricts to a bundle map , @xmath78 , with fiber @xmath79 . fixing a hyperplane @xmath9",
    ", we see that @xmath80 is also the restriction of the bundle map @xmath81 .",
    "clearly , this latter bundle is trivial ; hence , we have a diffeomorphism @xmath82    [ ex : pencil ] let @xmath83 be the arrangement of @xmath84 lines in @xmath85 defined by the polynomial @xmath86 .",
    "then @xmath87 consists of @xmath84 points in @xmath88 .",
    "thus , @xmath89 , and so @xmath90 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath91 .",
    "the ( integral ) cohomology ring of a hyperplane arrangement complement was computed by brieskorn in @xcite , building on pioneering work of arnold on the cohomology ring of the pure braid group . in @xcite , orlik and",

    "the basis @xmath109 of @xmath110 is dual to the basis of @xmath111 given by the meridians @xmath112 around the hyperplanes , oriented compatibly with the complex orientations on @xmath2 and the hyperplanes .",
    "furthermore , all the homology groups of @xmath4 are torsion - free ; the generating function for their ranks is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the mbius function of the intersection lattice , given inductively by @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "for details on all this , we refer to @xcite .",
    "recall that a finite cw - complex is formal if its rational cohomology ring is quasi - isomorphic to its sullivan s algebra of polynomial differential forms ( more details can be found in appendix [ sect : formal ] ) .",
    "it follows from brieskorn s work that the complement of a hyperplane arrangement @xmath1 is formal , in a very strong sense .",

    "similar considerations apply to the homology and cohomology of the projectivized complement , @xmath76 .",
    "in particular , if we let @xmath13 be the number of hyperplanes , then @xmath123 , with canonical basis the set @xmath124 , and @xmath125 we will denote by @xmath126 the image of @xmath127 in @xmath128 .",
    "let @xmath129 be an algebraically closed field .",

    "the induced homomorphism in cohomology restricts to an embedding @xmath141 .",
    "the irreducible components of @xmath142 that lie in the image of such an embedding are called _ non - essential _ ; the remaining components are called _",
    "essential_.    the description of the orlik  solomon algebra given in  [ subsec : os alg ] makes it clear that the resonance varieties @xmath134 depend only on the intersection lattice , @xmath6 , and on the characteristic of the field @xmath129 .",
    "a basic problem in the subject is to find concrete formulas making this dependence explicit .",
    "we will briefly discuss the positive characteristic case in  [ subsec : res p ] , but for now we will concentrate on the case when @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
