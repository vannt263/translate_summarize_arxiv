    "one of the important questions to be answered in identifying the microscopic origin of superconductivity in cuprates is the nature of the superconducting gap . a great deal of attention",
    "@xcite has been focused on identifying the symmetry of the pairing state since it is believed that this information will provide constraints that will lead to the identification of the pairing mechanism .",
    "for example , it has been suggested @xcite that pairing in high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) is induced by the exchange of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and in this case the pairing state would necessarily have d@xmath10 symmetry . from the many experiments carried out in this context",
    ", a consensus view has emerged @xcite that associates d@xmath10 symmetry with the pairing state in optimally hole - doped cuprates . however , this consensus is lacking ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) in the results of angle resolved photoemission @xcite , tunneling @xcite , infrared @xcite and raman spectroscopy @xcite experiments carried out on overdoped and underdoped compounds , where it appears that the material properties are very different from those of the optimally doped versions .",
    "since an appropriate model of the normal state must be capable of predicting the effects of doping , it is clear that additional experiments are required if one is to gain a complete understanding of superconductivity in the high - t@xmath9 cuprates .",
    "raman scattering has been widely used @xcite to investigate electronic excitations in superconductors . in electronic raman scattering experiments ,",
    "one may investigate various parts of the fermi surface by a simple choice of the incident and scattered polarization vectors .",
    "the b@xmath5 spectra sample @xcite regions of the fermi surface located near the brillouin zone ( bz ) principal axes [ i.e. @xmath14 , while b@xmath4 spectra sample regions located near the diagonal directions in the bz .",
    "when raman results are interpreted @xcite in terms of the conventional model , @xcite the gap is found to have maxima along the ( @xmath15 ) and ( @xmath16 ) directions and nodes ( or minima ) along the diagonal directions .",
    "the results are consistent with d@xmath10 symmetry and are thus in agreement with the outcome of several other experiments [ see scalapino @xcite for a review ] .",
    "the maximum values of the gap are found to scale with t@xmath9 ( @xmath17 ) between optimally doped bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bi2212 ) @xcite , yba@xmath0cu@xmath18o@xmath19 ( y123 ) @xcite , and la@xmath20sr@xmath21cuo@xmath22 ( la214 ) @xcite . in bi2212 ,",
    "the value derived from raman experiments ( @xmath23 ) is also in good agreement with the results of photoemission experiments ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the first raman investigation of the influence of doping was carried out on y123 @xcite and it was found that , although the symmetry appeared to be independent of doping , the b@xmath5 pair - breaking frequency ( @xmath25 ) decreased much more rapidly than t@xmath9 as the doping level was increased beyond optimal .",
    "later , kendziora _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite carried out measurements on both heavily overdoped and underdoped bi2212 . in the heavily overdoped region",
    "they also found that @xmath26 decreased and that the b@xmath5 and a@xmath5 peak frequencies approached equality , and suggested that this implied the existence of an isotropic gap .",
    "the low energy frequency dependence of their measured b@xmath5 and a@xmath5 spectra also appeared to be compatible with this interpretation .",
    "however , it was pointed out by hewitt _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite that the gap can not be isotropic if the _ bose - factor corrected _ spectra from all scattering geometries are considered .",
    "_ @xcite also carried out experiments on a heavily overdoped crystal of bi2212 and interpreted their results in terms of a disordered d - wave model proposed by devereaux @xcite .    in an attempt to gain additional insight into the influence of doping on the superconducting order parameter in htsc we have carried out raman scattering experiments on overdoped ( od ) and underdoped ( ud ) bi2212 crystals with critical temperatures , t@xmath27 = 82k , 85k , 86k , 90.5k ( ud ) and 89k , 87k , 83k ,",
    "70k , 55k ( od ) .",
    "spectra have been obtained in the b@xmath5 and b@xmath4 scattering geometries in both the superconducting and normal state .",
    "the b@xmath4 spectra of overdoped compounds , which were not carefully investigated in previous studies @xcite , have provided important information regarding the symmetry of @xmath3 .",
    "these spectra sample regions of the fermi surface that are located near the diagonal directions in the brillouin zone and hence can be used @xcite to directly probe for the existence of d - wave type gap nodes .",
    "our results suggest that the superconducting gap possesses d@xmath10 symmetry , for the doping range ( 0.12@xmath28 0.23 ) investigated  slightly underdoped to overdoped .",
    "in cuprates , the addition ( removal ) of oxygen increases ( decreases ) the cu valence @xcite and therefore the hole concentration . thus single crystals of bi2212 were subjected to various oxygen - rich or oxygen - poor environments in order to vary the hole concentrations , spanning the doping range 0.07 @xmath30 0.23 .",
    "the superconducting transition temperatures ( measured by the onset of the drop in magnetization or the zero of resistance ) and hole concentrations are listed in table  [ bi2212samples ] .",
    "hole concentrations for each crystal are estimated using the empirical relation of tallon and presland @xcite , assuming t@xmath31 .",
    "raman vibrational spectra in the frequency range 20 - 1000 @xmath32 were obtained using the 514.5 nm line of an argon ion ( ar@xmath33 ) laser as the excitation source .",
    "the raman measurements were carried out in a quasi - backscattering geometry , with the incident laser beam directed nearly perpendicular to the freshly cleaved ( * a*,*b * ) face of the crystal .",
    "bi2212 has an orthorhombic ( d@xmath34 ) structure with the * a * and * b * axes oriented at 45@xmath35 to the cu - o bonds . in raman experiments it is customary ( since a@xmath36 b ) to assume a tetragonal structure ( d@xmath37 ) with axes parallel to * a * and * b*. to facilitate comparison with other cuprates , however , we will consider a tetragonal cell with * x * and * y * axes parallel to the cu - o bonds .",
    "another set of axes , * x* and * y* are rotated by 45@xmath35 with respect to the cu - o bonds .",
    "considered within the tetragonal point group ( d@xmath37 ) , the * x**y* ( b@xmath5 ) scattering geometry means that the incident(scattered ) light is polarized along * x*(*y* ) and selection of this scattering channel enables coupling to excitations having b@xmath5 symmetry .",
    "similarly , the * xy * geometry allows coupling to b@xmath4 excitations , which transforms as d@xmath38 .",
    "finally , the diagonal scattering geometry * x**x* allows coupling to a@xmath5 + b@xmath4 and * x**x * to a@xmath5 + b@xmath5 excitations .",
    "thus , by choosing the polarization of the incident and scattered light appropriately , one may select different components of the raman tensor and thus various symmetry properties of the excitations .    the b@xmath5 and b@xmath4 symmetries probe @xcite complementary regions of the fermi surface ( fs ) , while the a@xmath5 spectra correspond to an approximate average over the entire fs . in particular , the b@xmath5 raman spectrum samples the fs along the ( 0,@xmath39 ) and ( @xmath39,0 ) directions whereas the b@xmath4 spectum samples the ( @xmath40,@xmath40 ) directions .",
    "that is , the b@xmath5 spectra sample the bz principal axes while the b@xmath4 spectra sample the bz diagonals , and are therefore used as complementary probes to obtain information about the * k * dependence of the gap .    the spectra presented in this section have been corrected for the bose thermal factor .",
    "therefore , the spectra shown are proportional to the imaginary part of the raman response function ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "spectra obtained from the cuprates at room temperature are characterized @xcite by a rather featureless continuum , extending from @xmath41 0 to 2 ev . when the samples are cooled below t@xmath9 the spectral weight at low energies ( @xmath42 )",
    "may be redistributed to higher energy and gap - like peaks appear in the spectra . in bi2212 the superconductivity induced renormalization observed in the b@xmath5 spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ b1 g ] ) produces a peak whose energy remains relatively constant ( for p @xmath8 0.16 ) , but decreases drastically with increasing hole concentration in the overdoped regime ( p @xmath43 0.16 ) . when the peak energy is compared ( fig .",
    "[ gap - b1g - arpes ] ) with the maximum sc gap ( @xmath44 ) values reported by arpes @xcite and tunneling @xcite , the results are striking .",
    "the doping dependence and energy of the b@xmath5 peak position corresponds very well with the values of @xmath25 obtained from arpes measurements on similarly doped samples ( see fig .",
    "[ gap - b1g - arpes ] ) .",
    "this supports the previous association of the peak frequency in the b@xmath5 spectra with the maximum ( @xmath45 ) in a d@xmath10 gap function .",
    "this association is also supported by the low frequency dependence of @xmath6 at low temperatures , as will be discussed in section [ fdchi ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath46 has also been plotted as a function of p in fig .",
    "[ kbtc - vs - p ] , where the results reveal that this ratio decreases monotonically with increasing hole concentration .",
    "a linear least - squares fit to the data is well described by the empirical relation , @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ b1 g ] that , as p is reduced , there is a reduction in the fraction of spectral weight redistributed at low frequencies .",
    "quantitatively , this redistribution was estimated by taking the ratio of the spectral weight above and below t@xmath9 .",
    "the frequency range of interest is selected to envelope the region where increased scattering in the superconducting state is observed . within this region , the points at which the normal and superconducting state spectra cross defines the upper and lower bounds on the integration .",
    "in this range , the ratio of the integrated intensity of the superconducting ( a@xmath0 ) vs. normal state ( a@xmath49 ) spectra are calculated , and the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ spectralweight ] .",
    "the redistributed spectral weight is reduced ( fig .",
    "[ spectralweight ] ) with decreasing hole concentration , indicating that fewer quasiparticles are participating in superconductivity .",
    "it may be that the quasiparticle pairs are being destroyed by some collective excitation of the crystal whose strength increases with decreasing doping",
    ". the missing spectral weight may be most likely redistributed to higher energy , as recently suggested by the work of naeini _ et al _ @xcite . in their study of la214",
    "it was found that the b@xmath5 spectral weight that is lost at low - energies ( @xmath50 800 @xmath32 ) is transferred to the higher energy region normally occupied by multi - magnon scattering .",
    "taken together , the results suggest that the quasiparticle density near @xmath51 is reduced by magnetic excitations of some type .",
    "of course , this suggestion requires further quantitative analysis .",
    "a redistribution of spectral weight also occurs below t@xmath9 in the b@xmath4 channel ( fig .",
    "[ b2 g ] ) but it is difficult ( except in the case of the 83 k overdoped sample ) to identify any peak formation in the low temperature b@xmath4 spectra of fig .",
    "[ b2 g ] . in the depleted regions of the spectra",
    "the intensity rises linearly at low frequencies then levels off at a frequency we will designate as @xmath52 ( a linear - to - constant crossover frequency ) . a linear fit is made to the low frequency data and @xmath52 is defined by the point at which the line departs from the experimental data points .",
    "this frequency can be taken as a measure of the extent of the depleted region and thus provides an estimate of the b@xmath4 `` gap '' energy @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath52 has a parabolic dependence on hole concentration ( fig .",
    "[ b2gpeak ] ) and in contrast to 2@xmath44 ( b@xmath5)actually scales with t@xmath9 throughout the doping range , consistent with the results obtained in raman experiments by opel _",
    "_ @xcite and sugai & hosokawa @xcite .",
    "thus , in the underdoped regime , the results obtained seem to be incompatible with the existence of a single , simple d - wave gap . on the other hand sugai and hosagawa @xcite",
    "have suggested that the values of 2@xmath44 obtained from the b@xmath5 spectra scale with the frequency of the 2-magnon peak .",
    "this observation suggests that b@xmath5 excitations are magnetic in origin .",
    "although not the topic of this paper , it remains to be seen whether the holon - spinon phase diagram model of anderson @xcite and lee @xcite may offer an explanation of these results .    in the overdoped regime",
    "one can observe superconductivity induced peaks in the b@xmath5 channel . in this region , ( p@xmath53 p@xmath54 both the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 decrease with increasing doping .",
    "however , @xmath55 decreases much more rapidly than does @xmath56 and as a result the peak frequencies become almost equal for p @xmath36 0.25 .",
    "this behaviour , which is similar to that observed in doping studies of la214@xcite , appears to be inconsistent @xcite with the existence of a gap with d@xmath10 symmetry .",
    "thus , although the b@xmath5 and b@xmath4 spectra of optimally doped compounds @xcite imply the existence of a d - wave gap , there are some puzzling discrepancies in this interpretation in both the underdoped and overdoped regions . in an attempt to gain additional insight we will now turn to an investigation of the dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath57 in the low energy region of the spectrum .",
    "the ( @xmath58 ) frequency dependence of scattering in the low energy regime , ( i.e. below @xmath59 ) provides a further test @xcite of the cooper pair symmetry . in the b@xmath4  geometry ,",
    "the observed frequency dependence of the response function remains linear in @xmath57 , regardless of the sample @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ b2 g ] ) .",
    "the only exception is found in examining the low energy region of the b@xmath4  spectra ( fig .",
    "[ 87kb2 g ] ) for the 87k ( od ) sample .",
    "one observes a change in slope of the raman response function at an energy of @xmath61 or @xmath62 . below this energy",
    "the scattering is constant and rises linearly at frequencies above 90 @xmath32 .",
    "these results have been repeated and are consistent with that described here .",
    "thus we are confident that the observations are intrinsic and not an experimental artifact . in an arpes investigation of a similarly overdoped ( t@xmath63= 87k )",
    "bi2212 crystal , ding _",
    "_ @xcite found that the sc gap function exhibited an extended node in the ( @xmath64 ) , ( @xmath65 ) directions in the bz .",
    "the modulation direction corresponds to the ( 0,0)@xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) region of the fermi surface of bi2212 .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed that the extended node feature ( p @xmath68 ) is an artifact of umklapp scattering , resulting from scattering of the outgoing electron by the wavevector of the modulation @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the extended node artifact near ( @xmath67 ) should be manifest in the density of excited states by an increased scattering at low energies .",
    "therefore , we contend that the increased , and constant , scattering found at low energies in the b@xmath4 channel ( for this particular crystal ) is consistent with umklapp scattering from the modulation .",
    "umklapp processes scatter a quasiparticle out of the first bz . in this case",
    ", a quasiparticle on the fermi surface can be scattered by an integral multiple of @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , in the extended zone scheme , the quasiparticle may thereby find itself on another portion of the fermi surface for which the fermi velocity is opposite to that which it possessed before being scattered .",
    "thus , this scattering process may reverse the fermi velocity of quasiparticles with wavevectors along the direction of the modulation wavevector .",
    "this scattering process may destroy the coherence that is required for pairing , leading to a destruction or depression of the gap along the ( @xmath71 ) direction in k - space .",
    "the effect would therefore be seen in the b@xmath4 scattering geometry .",
    "it is true that the raman intensity is proportional to the structure function @xmath72 .",
    "if the scattering process is instantaneous , i.e. time reversal symmetry holds , then the structure function is related by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem to the susceptibility @xmath73 .",
    "time reversal symmetry implies that the @xmath74 , or equivalently @xmath75 .",
    "consequently , the value of @xmath76 for @xmath77 .........    in the b@xmath5  spectra of fig .  [ b1 g ]",
    "the renormalization is quite strong in the range of hole concentrations covering the t@xmath9 s 82 k ( ud ) to 70 k ( od ) samples . in all but one spectra ( t@xmath9 = 89 k od ) a cubic low frequency dependence is observed , below the @xmath45 pair - breaking peak .",
    "it is also evident that there is poorer agreement with a cubic fit in the underdoped regime , where also the peak in the superconducting state appears at a relatively constant value around 565 @xmath78 .",
    "recent tunneling spectroscopy studies of underdoped bi2212 , which probe the gap at several points on crystals show that there exists local variation in the gap size .",
    "the results are interpreted in terms of an inhomogeneous distribution of oxygen . the poorer agreement ( fig .",
    "[ b1 g ] ) with a cubic fit is thought to be due to this intrinsic disorder , giving rise to a linear component to the scattering at low frequencies , as described by devereaux et al @xcite and seen in overdoped bi2212 .",
    "in addition , in other cuprate @xcite supercondcutors there is no redistribution of spectral weight below t@xmath9 in the underdoped regime , in contrast to the results presented here .",
    "this contradiction is resolved by the assumption that the underdoped crystals contains locally varying hole concentrations - the fraction of the crystal with a local value of @xmath79 is reduced as the hole concentration is also reduced ! consequently , the peak would remain near its value at optimal doping and be reduced in intensity , as observed .",
    "pairing functions such as an anisotropic s - wave or a d - wave gap are consistent with states lying below some maximum gap value . for a d - wave gap of the form d@xmath80 , electronic raman spectra in the b@xmath4 and b@xmath5 channels",
    "are predicted @xcite to display a linear ( in b@xmath4 ) and cubic ( in b@xmath5 ) power law behaviour below @xmath81 .",
    "conversely , the raman response function in the low energy regime for an isotropic s - wave gap should be @xcite characterized by the absence of states below the gap , expressed in experimental terms by exponentially activated behavior .    down to the lowest frequency measured ,",
    "the b@xmath5  and b@xmath4  spectra from all samples show scattering below the gap peaks which appear in the spectra below t@xmath9 .",
    "in particular , at all doping levels the b@xmath4 response function shows a linear rise in scattering at low frequencies for t @xmath8 t@xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the results are consistent with any gap function that posesses nodes ( as a line or point ) on the fermi surface near ( @xmath82 ) .    in the hole concentration range @xmath83 , the * linear * and * cubic * frequency dependences found for the b@xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ b2 g ] ) and b@xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ b1 g ] ) spectra , respectively , are consistent with the behaviour predicted for a d@xmath80 gap , and thus completely inconsistent with an isotropic s - wave gap .",
    "the cubic power law for a d@xmath10 pairing state was derived in the limit @xmath84 . however , even at the temperatures used in these studies , i.e 0.20 @xmath8 t / t@xmath85 0.28 , the power laws are still consistent with a d - wave gap .",
    "this suggests that the gap opens quite quickly below t@xmath9 .",
    "despite the presence of cation disorder , oxygen intercalation , b - axis modulation , and orthorhombicity that are common to bi2212 , the low - frequency power laws appear to persist throughout the doping range . the low - frequency scattering in the b@xmath5 channel is found to be consistent with a cubic frequency dependence . in b@xmath4 spectra , a linear - in-@xmath57 scattering is found for all samples studied , which indicates that there are nodes in the gap function near ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "therefore , the combined ( for @xmath87 ) power - law behavior ( @xmath57 in b@xmath4 and @xmath88 in b@xmath5 ) points to the existence of a d@xmath10 gap function for the doping range studied .",
    "in the b@xmath5 scattering geometry , the superconductivity induced renormalization peak frequency changes with doping . below a critical doping level ( p @xmath89 )",
    "the renormalization is not present ( see @xcite ) . with increasing hole concentration",
    "the peak energy remains relatively constant to p @xmath90 and then drops rather abruptly , by approximately 50 % over the hole concentration range @xmath91 ( i.e. overdoped regime ) . in the latter range , the b@xmath5 peak energy and doping dependence can be plotted on a curve that matches the @xmath25 feature observed in arpes and tunneling spectroscopy measurements .",
    "provided that the arpes results do indeed measure 2@xmath92 , these considerations provide substantial support for the assignment of the b@xmath5 renormalization peak to @xmath25 .",
    "one reason for the lack of a pair - breaking peak relies on the fact that the low - energy b@xmath5 spectral weight is reduced @xcite substantially with underdoping .",
    "if the quasiparticles are scattered away from the ( @xmath15 ) regions of the fermi surface , then the resulting b@xmath5 spectra would show a reduced intensity .",
    "a mechanism for such anisotropic scattering lies in the description of raman scattering in the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid model @xcite . in the model ,",
    "the presence of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , which are strongly peaked near the antiferromagnetic ordering vector @xmath93 , give rise to a enhanced scattering of quasiparticles on regions of the fermi surface that are located near the bz axes .",
    "for example , in such a process a quasiparticle can be scattered from ( @xmath94 ) to ( @xmath95 ) by emitting a ( @xmath64 ) magnon and back to ( @xmath94 ) by emitting a ( @xmath96 ) magnon ( fig .  [ hotspots ] ) . since the regions of the fs located near the diagonals are far from resonance with q , the quasiparticles in this region are much more weakly scattered .",
    "this gives rise @xcite to the terms `` hot - spots '' for regions of the fs near the bz axes and `` cold - spots '' for those near the diagonals .",
    "as the doping level decreases and the antiferromagnetic fluctuations grow and become more strongly peaked near q , the scattering will increase and hence the b@xmath5 spectral weight will decrease further . correspondingly , one would expect that cooper pairing of the highly damped `` hot '' quasiparticles to become increasingly unlikely in the underdoped regime . on this basis , the absence of a pair - breaking peak in the b@xmath5 channel for low doping levels ( p@xmath80.12 ) is thus to be expected .",
    "this picture also accounts for the rapid reduction , with decreasing hole concentration , of the b@xmath5 spectral weight that is involved in superconductivity .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the b@xmath5 spectra obtained from underdoped bi2212 appear to differ from that obtained from underdoped la214 and y123 . in the latter two compounds",
    "the b@xmath5 spectra change much more abruptly when the doping level is reduced below optimum . in these compounds",
    "a strong 2@xmath44 peak is observed in the b@xmath5 spectra obtained from optimally doped materials , but such a peak is completely absent @xcite in the underdoped compounds . in bi2212 however , a relatively strong b@xmath5 peak is observed still observed in the underdoped compounds ( see @xcite and fig .",
    "[ gap - b1g - arpes ] ) .",
    "in addition , the b@xmath5 spectral weight drops rapidly as one enters the underdoped regime @xcite of la214 or y123 but decreases more slowly with underdoping in bi2212 .",
    "it thus appears that the optimally doped state is more sharply defined in both la214 and y123 than it is in bi2212 .",
    "this might be attributed to the possibility that , because of cation disorder and the superstructural modulation , bi2212 is more inhomogeneous than la214 .",
    "the hole concentration in single crystals of bi2212 has been varied from 0.10 to 0.22 by varying the oxygen concentration and by y substitution .",
    "it has been found that the 2@xmath44 peak in the b@xmath5 spectrum increases in energy as the hole concentration is reduced from p=0.22 to p=0.12 according to the empirical relation , @xmath97 .",
    "both the magnitude of @xmath44 and its doping dependence , as determined from the raman spectra , are in good agreement with the results of arpes measurements @xcite of the leading edge shift that occurs below t@xmath9 .",
    "these results provide support for the association of the 2@xmath92 peak of the b@xmath5 spectra with the superconducting gap energy as determined by arpes measurements .",
    "it is also found that the strength of the b@xmath5 renormalization , that occurs below t@xmath9 , becomes weaker as the hole concentration is reduced from p=0.22 to p=0.12 and can not be observed in crystals with hole concentrations less than p@xmath360.12 .",
    "this observation is consistent with the selective scattering of quasiparticles on regions of the fermi surface that are located near the k@xmath21 and k@xmath98 axes of the brillouin zone .",
    "a possible mechanism for this scattering is provided by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations @xcite which grow in strength as the hole concentration of the crystals is decreased .",
    "the b@xmath4 spectra show a very weak renormalization at t@xmath9 for two of the four crystals studied in this work . the 82k",
    "the cross - over frequency ( @xmath52 ) exhibits a parabolic dependence on hole concentration - similar to that found for t@xmath9 .",
    "in fact @xmath99 appears to scale with t@xmath9 according to the relation @xmath100",
    "@xmath36 5k@xmath101t@xmath9 , as has been suggested by others @xcite .",
    "the b@xmath4 response function , at t = 20k , increases linearly at low frequencies in most of the samples studied .",
    "this observation is consistent @xcite with the presence of nodes in the superconducting gap , in the direction @xmath102 .",
    "the only exception to this linear behaviour at low temperature was observed in the b@xmath4 spectrum of an overdoped crystal with t@xmath9 = 87k . in this case",
    "the scattered intensity remained constant for all frequencies @xmath103 @xmath32 .",
    "it is interesting that in arpes experiments carried out on an overdoped crystal with the same t@xmath63 it was found that gap was zero over an extended region of the fs , which could be consistent with @xmath104 constant below a certain frequency .",
    "this constant is believed to be an artifact associated with umklapp scattering from the superstructural modulation .    finally , it should be noted that results obtained here for the doping dependence of the spectra are , in most respects , similar to those obtained in other cuprates @xcite .",
    "one exception appears to be the fact that in the underdoped regime the spectral weight depletion , and the strength of the b@xmath5 renormalization in bi2212 , decrease less abruptly as p is decreased below p@xmath36 p@xmath54 .",

    "<S> bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 crystals with varying hole concentrations ( 0.12 @xmath2 0.23 ) were studied to investigate the effects of doping on the _ symmetry _ and _ magnitude _ of the superconducting gap ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> electronic raman scattering experiments that sample regions of the fermi surface near the diagonal ( b@xmath4 ) and principal axes ( b@xmath5 ) of the brillouin zone ( bz ) have been utilized . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency dependence of the raman response function , @xmath6 , at low energies ( @xmath7 ) is found to be linear for b@xmath4 and cubic for b@xmath5 ( t@xmath8 t@xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter observations have led us to conclude that the doping dependence of the superconducting gap is consistent with d@xmath10 symmetry , for slightly underdoped and overdoped crystals . </S>",
    "<S> studies of the pair - breaking peak found in the b@xmath5 spectra demonstrate that the magnitude of the maximum gap ( @xmath11 ) decreases monotonically with increasing hole doping , for @xmath12 . based on the magnitude of the b@xmath5 renormalization </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the number of quasiparticles participating in pairing increases monotonically with increased doping . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the b@xmath4 spectra show a weak `` pair - breaking peak '' that follows a parabolic - like dependence on hole concentration , for 0.12 @xmath13 0.23 . </S>"
