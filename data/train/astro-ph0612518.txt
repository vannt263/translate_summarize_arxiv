    "deep radio surveys over the last decade have pointed to the presence of a new population of radio sources distinct from classical radio galaxies and qsos .",
    "these sources start to dominate the count for @xmath2 mjy and they are responsible for the flattening in the source count for sub - mjy levels .",
    "many different schemes have been put forward to explain this ` excess ' of faint radio sources , including a non - evolving population of local ( @xmath3 ) low luminosity radio galaxies @xcite , strongly evolving normal spirals @xcite and starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "the sub - mjy radio source population is now thought to be a mix of low luminosity agn , normal spirals and ellipticals , as well as starbursts , but surprisingly little is known about the exact nature of the faint radio population and the sources which dominate .",
    "this is because sub - mjy radio sources have faint optical counterparts and hence obtaining complete optical identifications has been historically difficult .    to help alleviate the significant time overheads of optical followup ,",
    "we have targeted the hubble deep field south ( hdfs ) .",
    "this is a very well - studied field with publicly available data ranging in wavelengths from radio to uv - optical .",
    "the hubble space telescope has observed this field to about 30th magnitude in the optical @xcite , and similar depths in uv @xcite and nir @xcite .",
    "in addition to the main deep fields , the hst imaged nine flanking fields to a depth of i(f814w ) @xmath0 26 . from the ground ,",
    "wide field imaging is available for an area @xmath4 arcmin in extent around the hdfs , which reaches about 25th magnitude in ubvri @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy has been obtained on the vlt for 194 targets in the main hdfs and flanking fields , resulting in reliable redshifts for 97 galaxies @xcite .",
    "photometric redshifts are also available for thousands of galaxies in the hdfs and surrounding regions @xcite , which have typical errors @xmath5 .",
    "radio observations of the hdfs were made between 1998 and 2001 with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) using all four available frequency bands . between 100 to 300 hours of observing at each band yielded images at 1.4 , 2.5 , 5.2 and 8.7 ghz with maximum sensitivities of @xmath6jy rms .",
    "a detailed description of the observations , data reduction , and initial results was given by @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the full 1.4 ghz catalogue , a detailed 1.4 ghz image analysis and radio source count was presented in @xcite ( hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "the advantage of the athdfs dataset over other deep radio surveys is that it is at four frequencies , making it possible to do an analysis of the radio spectra of the individual sources and identify those with spectra characteristic of agn .",
    "this paper details the 2.5 , 5.2 and 8.7 ghz catalogue and an analysis of the radio spectral properties of sources in the athdfs .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows .",
    "we summarise the the 2.5 , 5.2 and 8.7 ghz observations and data reduction in section [ sec : obs ] .",
    "a detailed analysis of the images at these three frequencies is discussed in section [ imageanalysis ] , and the catalogues listed in section [ catalogues ] .",
    "we present a consolidated catalogue in section [ combcat ] where radio sources have been matched across all four athdfs bands .",
    "section [ alphasect ] presents an analysis of the radio spectral index of athdfs sources and other interesting radio sources are discussed in section [ inter_src ] .",
    "we assume a hubble constant of 71 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 throughout this paper .",
    "here we provide a brief summary of the 2.5 , 5.2 and 8.7 ghz observations and data reduction which are discussed in detail in paper i. the observations consist of single pointings centred on ra = 22h 33 m 25.96s and dec = @xmath1060@xmath11 38 09.0 ",
    "( j2000 ) ( 2.5 ghz ) , and ra = 22h 32 m 56.22s and dec = @xmath1060@xmath11 33 02.7  ( j2000 ) ( 5.2 and 8.7 ghz ) .",
    "the 5.2 and 8.7 ghz observations are centred on the hst wfpc field , while the 2.5 ghz observations were pointed halfway between the wfpc field and a bright confusing source to allow the bright source to be well cleaned from the 2.5 ghz image .",
    "we used a wide variety of atca configurations to maximise _ uv _ coverage .",
    "the correlator was set to continuum mode ( @xmath12 mhz bandwidth ) , with each 128 mhz bandwidth divided into @xmath13 mhz channels .",
    "the primary flux density calibrator is pks b1934 - 638 , while secondary gain and phase calibrations were taken throughout our observations using both pks b2205 - 636 and pks b2333 - 528 .",
    "the 2.5 and 5.2 ghz images contained sidelobes from off - field sources .",
    "the image sensitivity was improved by removing the clean components of these off - field sources before the final imaging .",
    "the 2.5 ghz image was also improved with one iteration of phase and amplitude self - calibration .",
    "the 5.2 and 8.7 ghz data were of sufficient quality that self - calibration was not needed .",
    "the parameters of the final athdfs images are summarised in table [ athdfssummarytab ] .",
    "the 1.4 ghz values are included for completeness .",
    "for each frequency we list the pointing ( j2000 ) , number of effective hours observed , and synthesised beam ( size and position angle ) . the rms noise at the image centre is also given , along with the value of the most negative pixel .",
    "if _ uv _ coverage is poor , the cleaning process can redistribute flux from real sources on to noise peaks .",
    "our _ uv _ coverage is good , and in paper ii we found that clean bias was small at 1.4 ghz .",
    "here we perform a similar test on the 2.5 , 5.2 and 8.7 ghz images .    to perform the clean bias check ,",
    "point sources are injected random positions in the data before cleaning , and the data cleaned to the same level as the final images .",
    "source peak fluxes before and after cleaning were then compared .",
    "we injected 40 sources at @xmath14 , 15 at @xmath15 , 15 at @xmath16 , 15 at @xmath17 , 15 at @xmath18 , 10 at @xmath19 , 3 at @xmath20 , 2 at @xmath21 , 1 at @xmath22 and 1 at @xmath23 .",
    "this simulation was repeated 50 times to get reliable number statistics .",
    "figure [ fig : clnbias ] shows the result of our clean bias check .",
    "the average source flux measured after the cleaning process ( s@xmath24 ) divided by the true source flux ( s@xmath25 ) is shown for the various values of input source signal - to - noise ( s@xmath26 ) .",
    "it is evident that clean bias only affects the faintest sources .",
    "an analytical form of the clean bias effect was obtained by a least squares fit to the function @xmath27 the best fit values for @xmath28 and @xmath29 are shown in table [ clnbiasfit ] .",
    "the resulting best fit curves are plotted as solid lines in figure [ fig : clnbias ] .",
    "bandwidth smearing is a well - known effect caused by the finite width of the receiver channels .",
    "this aberration reduces the peak flux density of a source while correspondingly increasing the size of a source such that the integrated flux density is conserved . in paper",
    "ii we found that the 1.4 ghz image is affected by bandwidth smearing , and at 20 arcmin from the phase centre , which is the 1.4 ghz catalogue limit , sources are attenuated by @xmath018% .",
    "we calculate the bandwidth smearing attenuation for the 2.5 , 5.2 and 8.7 ghz images using the appropriate beam parameters and equation 1 from paper ii .",
    "since bandwidth smearing is inversely proportional to frequency we expect the attentuation to be lower at these higher frequencies than at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the bandwidth smearing as a function of distance from the centre for the three images are shown in figure [ fig : bandsmear ] .",
    "the dashed lines in figure [ fig : bandsmear ] indicate the maximum distance at which sources are catalogued .",
    "we find bandwidth smearing is at most 5% in the 2.5 ghz image , and negligible at the two higher frequencies .      to investigate the noise characteristics of our images , and eventually obtain catalogues based on the local signal to noise ratio ( snr ) , we construct noise maps .",
    "noise maps which contain the pixel by pixel root mean square ( rms ) noise distribution of each of the athdfs images were made using the sextractor package @xcite .",
    "sextractor has been found to be to be reliable for radio images ( paper ii , @xcite ) .    as for paper ii , we ran sextractor on the athdfs images with a mesh size set to 8 @xmath30 8 beams .",
    "grey scale images of the sextractor noise maps are shown in figure [ noisemap ] .",
    "the noise is lowest in the centre and increases with radial distance , as expected from single - pointing observations which are dominated by primary beam effects .",
    "figure [ radialnoiseprops ] shows the average noise as a function of distance from the centre for the three athdfs noise maps .",
    "this increase in noise is roughly a parabolic shape due to the primary beam attenuation .",
    "histograms of the pixel values of each noise map are shown in the figure [ histnoiseprops ] .",
    "the distributions peak at a value of about 10 @xmath31jy , but have large wings at high noise values due to the radially increasing noise .    in paper",
    "ii we found regions of increased noise around bright sources .",
    "the 2.5 ghz noise map clearly shows increased noise around the brightest ( @xmath32 = 112 mjy ) source , although the dynamic range problem is not as large here as for 1.4 ghz .",
    "the area around this bright confusing source has noise which is up to a factor of 2 greater than the nearby unaffected region .",
    "this can be seen as the noise bump at approximately 6  arcmin from the 2.5 ghz image centre .",
    "the noise in the 5.2 and 8.7 ghz images is unaffected by bright sources .",
    "a sensible maximum radial distance for the source cataloging has been determined , accounting for the following factors : i ) the radial noise distribution , ii ) the primary beam attenuation , and iii ) the bandwidth smearing effect . the dominant effect at 2.5 , 5.2 and 8.7 ghz is the primary beam attenuation . similar to paper ii for 1.4 ghz , we catalogue to the 40% response level of the primary beam .",
    "thus the maximum radial distances are 12 , 5.5 and 3.5 arcmins for the 2.5 , 5.2 and 8.7 ghz images , respectively . as mentioned in section [ sec : bandsmear ] , this results in bandwidth smearing of only 5% _ at worst _ for sources at the edge of the 2.5 ghz catalogued region .",
    "signal - to - noise maps are generated by dividing the original radio maps by the sextractor noise map .",
    "the _ miriad _ task _",
    "imsad _ was then used to derive a preliminary list of source `` islands '' with a peak flux density level of at least @xmath33 .",
    "this task searches for `` islands '' of pixels above a cutoff , set here to @xmath33 , and attempts to fit gaussian components to the `` islands '' .",
    "this resulted in 258 , 80 and 36 source `` islands '' extracted at 2.5 , 5.2 and 8.7 ghz , respectively .",
    "to derive source flux densities and sizes , we fit each source `` island '' found by _ imsad _ with an elliptical gaussian .",
    "all sources were visually inspected for obvious failures and poor fits .",
    "a reference peak value was derived using the ( _ miriad _ interpolation task _ maxfit _ ) , and the gaussian fit was considered good if the difference between the fitted peak and reference peak was less than 20% of the reference value and the fitted position was inside the 0.9@xmath34 flux density contour .",
    "we compared the gaussian integrated fluxes to fluxes directly measured from summing pixels greater than @xmath35 in the source area . in many cases",
    "the gaussian fit provided good values for the position and peak flux densities but not for integrated flux densities .",
    "these sources are flagged with `` 2 '' in the catalogue .",
    "the reliability of the sources was estimated by running source extraction on the negative images .",
    "this is a valid estimate provided the cleaning process did nt add extra negative or positive peaks on to the images .",
    "as described in paper i , the clean model residuals were monitored and the cleaning process was stopped when there was no reduction from extra components .",
    "so we expect that the cleaning process did nt add many positive or negative peaks .",
    "table [ reliability ] summarizes the results of running source extraction on the negative image . at 5@xmath36",
    "the 5.2 and 8.7 ghz catalogues have over 96% reliability . at 2.5 ghz",
    "we have enough statistics to examine the 5  5.5 @xmath36 sources , and find that these are only about 40% reliable . with a snr greater than 5.5 @xmath36",
    "the 2.5 ghz catalogue would have about 99% reliability .",
    "we thus cut off the catalogues at 5.5@xmath36 , 5@xmath36 and 5@xmath36 at 2.5 , 5.2 and 8.7 ghz .",
    "the final catalogues have 71 , 24 and 6 sources at 2.5 , 5.2 and 8.7 ghz , respectively .    given a prior 1.4 ghz position , it maybe feasible to push the detection limit lower than 5@xmath36 .",
    "we searched for low snr sources by matching 3  5@xmath36 sources which lie within 2@xmath36 positional uncertainty of a 1.4 ghz source .",
    "the positional uncertainty was determined by adding the average 1.4 ghz uncertainty ( 1.1 arcsec ) in quadrature with the positional uncertainty of a 3@xmath36 source . at 2.5 ghz",
    "the allowed positional offset is 3.8 arcsec , and for 5.2 and 8.7 ghz it is 2.8 arcsec .",
    "thus , there are are 71 , 18 , and 2 sources at 2.5 , 5.2 and 8.7 ghz , respectively , which are low snr high frequency counterparts to 1.4 ghz sources .",
    "we include these sources in supplementary catalogues .",
    "to test the reliability of the low snr supplementary catalogues , we shifted the 1.4 ghz positions by 0.5 arcmin and repeated the matching of 3  5@xmath36 sources . as a result",
    ", we estimate that 4/71 ( 6% ) of the low snr 2.5 ghz sources are false , and no false low snr sources were found at 5.2 and 8.7 ghz .",
    "the main catalogues for the three frequencies are presented in tables [ catalogue25 ] to [ catalogue87 ] .",
    "these are independent , statistically complete and reliable catalogues for each frequency .",
    "we also include supplementary catalogues for each frequency ( tables [ catalogue25supp ] and [ catalogue5287supp ] ) .",
    "the supplementary catalogues contain low snr sources which have a priori 1.4 ghz positions .",
    "a description of the tables is as follows .",
    "_ column ( 1 ) _  source i d .",
    "the i d numbering for the supplementary catalogues starts from the end of the main catalogues .",
    "_ column ( 2 ) _  right ascension in j2000 .",

    "one sigma uncertainty of declination , in arcsec .",
    "_ column ( 6 ) _  source peak flux density , in mjy .",
    "the values given here are not corrected for the systematic effects described in section [ imageanalysis ] .",

    "including the 1.4 ghz catalogue from paper ii , we have catalogues at four radio frequencies .",
    "the four images have similar sensitivities , but different area coverages .",
    "we now combine these independent catalogues into one consolidated catalogue which lists the flux densities at all frequencies for each individual radio source .",
    "we start by matching the positions of the sources in the 1.4 ghz catalogue ( paper ii ) against all source positions in the three higher frequency catalogues .",
    "the allowable offset was set to @xmath35 , i.e. 3 times the positional uncertainties in the catalogues ( added in quadrature ) .",
    "this results in a total of 499 individual sources comprising :    * the 466 1.4 ghz sources , as presented in paper ii , * 11 unmatched 2.5 ghz sources , * 5 unmatched 5.2 ghz sources , * 4 unmatched 8.7 ghz sources .",
    "each of the 486 sources from this first pass was inspected for missed matches .",
    "the simple @xmath35 positional cutoff missed bona fide matches due to a variety of reasons , including :    1 .",
    "the positional errors being smaller than the image cellsize , and hence the allowable offset was too small , and 2 .",
    "individual sources at 1.4 ghz catalogued as multiple sources at higher frequencies and resolution .",
    "after inspection we find that only five 2.5 ghz sources and two 8.7 ghz sources remain un - matched to sources in the 1.4 ghz catalogue .",
    "the final consolidated catalogue contains 473 individual sources .",
    "the consolidated catalogue is presented in table [ combcatalog ] .",
    "it includes information from the supplementary catalogues .",

    "note that the flux densities in this catalogue are peak flux densities for sources undeconvolved at that particular frequency , otherwise integrated flux densities are presented .",
    "the radio spectral indices are discussed in the following section .",
    "spectral indices for our sources can not be obtained from the original catalogues since the resolution of the images differ between the frequencies . in particular , low surface brightness regions that are detected in the low resolution 1.4 ghz image",
    "may be resolved out at higher frequencies .",
    "we therefore produced low resolution images at 2.5 , 5.2 and 8.7 ghz by imaging only the _ uv _ data that was equal to , or less than , the highest resolution _ uv _ point in the 1.4 ghz image ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the resulting images are of similar resolution to the 1.4 ghz image .",
    "flux density measurements from these low resolution images were made and the resulting spectral indices for sources detected at more than one frequency are given in table [ combcatalog ] .",
    "the upper limit to @xmath41 is also given for 1.4 ghz sources that lie within the 2.5 ghz catalogued region .",
    "the distribution of the spectral indices is plotted in figures [ alphafig1 ] to [ alphafig3 ] .",
    "the peak in the distribution of the spectral index @xmath42 ( @xmath39 ) is @xmath100.5 .",
    "this is close to , but flatter than , the canonical value of @xmath100.8 expected for radio synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "this is because the spectral indices plotted here are only for athdfs sources detected at both frequencies , which introduces a bias towards flatter sources .",
    "many steep spectrum 1.4 ghz sources are not detected at 2.5 ghz because the images have similar rms sensitivities .",
    "the alpha upper limit is shown in figure [ alphafig4 ] , which indicates we can not detect faint ( @xmath43 mjy ) sources with @xmath44 at 2.5 ghz .",
    "the mean spectral index @xmath41 for all sources including the supplementary 2.5 ghz detections is @xmath100.54 @xmath45 0.25 .",
    "the mean spectral index of the 2.5 ghz selected sample ( @xmath46 ) is @xmath100.39 @xmath45 0.17 .",
    "this is consistent with previous work which finds that samples selected at higher frequency have flatter spectral indices ( e.g @xcite ) .    in figure [ alphafig4 ]",
    "we show the spectral indexes as a function of 1.4 ghz flux density for 136 sources in both the 1.4 ghz and 2.5 ghz catalogues .",
    "our sample is complete to @xmath00.1 mjy at both 1.4 ghz and 2.5 ghz and the mean spectral index , @xmath41 , for sources with 0.1 @xmath47 mjy is @xmath100.66 @xmath45 0.28 , with a median value of @xmath100.62 .",
    "these values are consistent with the spectral indexes for bright samples at these flux densities ( although between 1.4 and 5 ghz ) ( prandoni et al .",
    "whilst some authors have observed a flattening of the spectral index at the sub - mjy level @xcite , we have limited statistics to explore this regime .",
    "the spectral shape of a radio source can give clues to the physical source of the radio emission .",
    "for a homogeneous , optically thin synchrotron radio source with constant magnetic field strength @xmath48 , the electron energies have a power law distribution of the form : @xmath49 and the spectral index @xmath50 .",
    "the typical observed value of the spectral index is @xmath51 , so @xmath52 , although this only applies at higher frequencies . at low frequencies",
    "the emitting gas is optically thick and self - absorption becomes important .",
    "the radio spectra turns over to yield @xmath53 , but the exact frequency of the turnover depends on many parameters , including the magnetic field strength @xmath48 and electron density . in agn ,",
    "the spectral indices are close to flat but progressively steeper ( @xmath54 ) at higher radio frequencies .",
    "the flatness of the radio spectrum in agn is attributed to the complex source structure , where the low frequency turnover is different for various components of the radio source ( e.g. nrao140 ; @xcite ) . when the turnover frequency is high enough , it is possible to observe an inverted spectrum",
    ".    this flat or inverted spectrum can not be produced by normal synchrotron emission from star formation processes .",
    "the spectral index of our radio sources therefore provides us with a diagnostic to identify agns in our sample .",
    "the uncertainty in the spectral index for faint sources becomes large at about @xmath55 mjy ( see figure [ alphafig4 ] ) .",
    "we therefore use the following conservative classification scheme : if @xmath55 mjy sources must have @xmath56 to be classed as agn , and brighter sources must have @xmath57 . the 34 sources which are classed as agn in this way",
    "are flagged as agn in table [ combcatalog ] .",
    "three sources have been flagged as a subclass of agn called gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) , because the spectrum is inverted between 1.4 and 2.5 ghz , but steep at higher frequency .",
    "this indicates that these sources may be young , extremely compact agn ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "the three gps sources are discussed in detail in section [ gpssect ] .",
    "classical radio galaxies have been classed morphologically into two types @xcite :    1 .   fanaroff riley class 1 ( fri ) radio galaxies are agn with radio jets that become more diffuse in regions distant from the galactic nucleus , and 2 .",
    "fanaroff riley class 2 ( frii ) radio galaxies are lobe dominated with bright emitting hot - spots in the outer region of their radio lobes .",
    "there is a strong correlation of morphology with radio luminosity , as noted by @xcite . for low frequencies ( 178 mhz ) ,",
    "sources with radio luminosities greater than @xmath58 w hz@xmath7 sr@xmath7 are almost all frii type , and lower luminosity sources are fri ( @xcite , and references therein ) . at ghz frequencies",

    "bl lac objects are fri radio galaxies with jets aligned along the line of sight , and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) are frii radio galaxies viewed in a similar way @xcite .",
    "spectroscopically , the host of fris usually have weak , if any , narrow emission lines @xcite .",
    "most show a quiescent elliptical galaxy spectrum . in this sense ,",
    "fris are thought to have no photo - ionizing flux , and the difference between fris and friis is due to the different accretion processes present in these galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , but see @xcite ) .",
    "the discovery of a fri radio structure associated with a strong broad line emitting quasar e1821 + 643 is inconsistent with this paradigm .",
    "e1821 + 643 is an x - ray selected quasar serendipitously found to be associated with an fri @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that fri radio galaxies with quasar hosts have not been found previously due to the low sensitivity of older radio surveys , such as 3crr , and the low space density of quasars .",

    "this source is dominated by radio emission from both the core and inner regions close to the core of the object . on this basis , and having detected weak radio lobes ( figure [ fig : fr1 ] ) , we suggest this is a possible fri class radio galaxy",
    ". however , the unresolved source to the north maybe an edge - leading hotspot , so the radio morphology is unclear .",
    "if the northern source is a hotspot then athdfs_223319.1 - 604428 is a moderate redshift frii with a typical optical host .",
    "giant radio galaxies are defined to be radio sources with a projected linear size greater than 1 mpc .",
    "giant radio galaxies are useful for studying the late stages of radio source evolution because they are thought to be old radio sources . they have been used to test orientation dependent unified schemes and to probe the intergalactic medium at different redshifts ( e.g. subrahmanyan et al . 1996 ) . according to models of radio source evolution ( e.g. kaiser et al . 1997 , blundell et al .",
    "1999 ) , giant radio galaxies must be extremely old ( typically older than @xmath63 yr ) and usually located in under - dense environments , as compared to smaller radio sources of comparable radio power ( e.g. kaiser & alexander 1999 ) .    visually inspecting the 1.4 ghz image",
    ", we find a giant radio galaxy in the hubble deep field south region which was not included in the original athdfs 1.4 ghz catalogue .",
    "this is because it lies 27 arcmin from the image centre , and the original catalogue only included sources out to 20 arcmin ( see paper ii ) .",
    "this giant radio galaxy , athdfs_223432.9 - 601239 , has a fitted peak of @xmath64 2.8 @xmath45 0.2 mjy and the core has an integrated flux density of 16.4 @xmath45 1.2 mjy .",
    "some of the extended radio structure maybe resolved out in the full resolution 1.4 ghz image , so we produced a tapered image and find the integrated flux density in the low resolution image is 21 mjy .",
    "contours of this source in both the full and low resolution image are shown in figure [ fig : giantradio ] .",
    "the optical host galaxy is bright , with b mag = 17.68 and i mag = 14.95 @xcite .",
    "we summarise the properties of this giant radio galaxy in table [ giantradiotable ] .",
    "a low resolution spectrum was taken of this object with the 2df spectrograph in 2001 .",
    "the spectrum is clearly that of a quiescent elliptical galaxy ( figure [ fig : giantradiospec ] ) , as expected of a galaxy with an old stellar population .",
    "fitting the absorption features , we find that this optical host is at a redshift of 0.121 . at this redshift",
    ", the linear extent of 390 arcsec translates to a size of 0.83 mpc and it has a 1.4 ghz radio power of 10@xmath65 w hz@xmath7 .    the core and lobes of this giant radio galaxy are individually detected at 853 mhz in the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ) survey @xcite .",
    "the core has an integrated flux density of 16.3 mjy at 853 mhz @xcite .",
    "hence , the source has a inverted spectral index @xmath66 = 0.51 @xmath45 0.21 , as expected of an agn .",
    "gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources are compact , powerful radio sources with a well - defined peak in their spectra at around 1 ghz .",
    "gps radio sources make up a significant fraction of the bright radio source population ( @xmath0 10% ) , but their contribution at low flux densities is not well known .",
    "the turnover in the sed of gps sources at about a ghz is due to either synchrotron self - absorption @xcite , free - free absorption @xcite or absorption from induced compton scattering @xcite .",
    "gps sources have linear sizes comparable to or smaller than their optical host galaxies .",
    "high resolution radio interferometeric observations have revealed that gps sources have double lobed morphology , like classical radio galaxies , but on smaller scales of @xmath67 1 kpc ( e.g. stanghellini et al . 1997 ) .",
    "two explanations have been proposed to explain the compactness of these objects : 1 ) gps sources are young unevolved radio sources ( e.g. fanti et al . 1995 ) , and 2 ) gps sources are confined by the interstellar medium of the host galaxy ( e.g. odea et al . 1991 ) .",
    "the current evidence favours the youth scenario : there is no compelling evidence to suggest there is enough dense gas to confine gps sources ( pihlstrom et al .",
    "2003 ) , the observed expansion speed of gps hotspots ( 0.1  0.2@xmath68 ) imply ages of @xmath69 years if the lobes expand at constant velocity , and the synchrotron cooling time of the radiating electrons indicate ages of @xmath69  @xmath70 years ( murgia et al . 1999 ) .    in the athdfs we have identified three gps radio sources , athdfs_223327.6 - 603414 , athdfs_223323.2 - 603249 . and athdfs_223259.5 - 602810",
    "these sources have an inverted sed between 1.4 and 2.5 ghz , and a steep sed at frequencies between 2.5 and 8.7 ghz .",
    "we do not have a detailed radio sed for these objects , but our observations constrain the turnover frequency to between 2  4 ghz .",
    "these sources are compact , but marginally resolved in the 2.5 ghz image , where they are detected at the highest snr",
    ". they are unresolved in the higher resolution 5.2 and 8.7 ghz images , so they are probably not resolved at 2.5 ghz , but just fit with a slightly larger than point source gaussian .",
    "one gps source , athdfs_223259.5 - 602810 , is not detected in ground - based ctio imaging to i mag @xmath0 23 @xcite , but this source lies near a bright star so optical photometry is uncertain .",
    "the other two sources lie within the hst flanking field observations , but are not detected .",
    "the hst flanking field observations reach a depth of i ( f814w ) mag = 26.0 @xcite . assuming the hubble diagram found for gps sources ( @xcite , @xcite ) holds for these two gps sources , a radio source with i mag = 26.0",
    "is expected to lie at @xmath71 .",
    "assuming i mag @xmath72 26.0 and neglecting k corrections , these sources are fainter than an absolute i ( f814w ) mag = @xmath1020.0 at a redshift of @xmath73",
    ". results from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have found that @xmath74 = @xmath1021.26 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath75 = -21.77 assuming the the conversion from the sdss team .",
    "gps sources at redshifts @xmath76 are usually one to two magnitudes brighter than @xmath77 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this implies these two gps sources are either unusually faint in the optical , or are at @xmath78 .",
    "tracing radio galaxies out to high redshift provides a way to study the formation and evolution of massive galaxies in the early universe .",
    "the well known hubble @xmath79@xmath80 relation ( e.g. @xcite ) is evidence that high z radio galaxies can be used as a tracer of the most massive star forming galaxies .",
    "radio galaxies have now been found out to redshifts of 5.2 @xcite .",
    "one of the most successful ways to select high redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) is by using the ultra steep spectrum ( uss ) selection technique ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we find 29 sources in the athdfs with @xmath81 ( see table [ combcatalog ] ) .",
    "most ( 21 ) of the sources have bright ( i mag @xmath82 ) optical counterparts in ground based imaging .",
    "another 4 sources are radio lobes of multiple component radio sources",
    ". the other 4 uss sources could be high redshift agn .",
    "these candidates are listed in table [ uss ] .",
    "followup observations of these candidates are required to determine if these sources are hzrgs .",
    "deep radio observations of the hubble deep field south region with @xmath83 rms sensitivities of @xmath010 @xmath31jy at 2.5 , 5.2 and 8.7 ghz yield catalogues consisting of 71 sources at 2.5 ghz , 24 sources at 5.2 ghz and 6 sources at 8.7 ghz . we have constructed a consolidated radio catalogue from the four frequency observations of the athdfs , which has 473 individual radio sources .",
    "radio spectral indices were calculated for sources detected at more than one frequency . in deriving the spectral indices ,",
    "care was taken to correct for spatial resolution effects . for sources detected at both 1.4 ghz and 2.5 ghz",
    ", we find the peak in the distribution of the spectral index @xmath84 is @xmath100.5 .",
    "we use the spectral index to identify possible agn . of the 136 sources with radio spectral information ,",
    "34 have flat or inverted spectra and are therefore classified as agn .",
    "we also identify some interesting radio sources in the athdfs survey .",
    "one source , athdfs_223319.1 - 604428 , is a radio galaxy at @xmath62 with a broad mgii emission line , and a possible fri morphology . in the 1.4 ghz image",
    "we have also found a giant radio galaxy , athdfs_223432.9 - 601239 , which has an extent of 0.8 mpc from lobe to lobe .",
    "this giant radio galaxy is at a redshift of @xmath85 and its spectrum is consistent with an old stellar population .",
    "three radio sources have radio seds which peak between 2  4 ghz , and hence are classed as gigahertz peaked spectrum sources .",
    "two of these gps sources are not detected in hst flanking field observations to i ( f814w ) mag = 26.0 , which implies they are either unusually underluminous in the optical or lie at high redshifts @xmath78 . using the ultra - steep spectrum selection technique",
    ", we find there are 4 possible high redshift radio galaxies in our sample .    the hdfs has been the target of deep multicolor optical photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "the spitzer space telescope has also imaged the hdfs in the infrared .",
    "the athdfs observations were carried out over several years , and hence it is also a good dataset to investigate time varying radio sources at these frequencies .",
