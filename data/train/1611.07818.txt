    "in this contribution we report on new results in continuation of our study of scalar meson properties analyzing jointly the data on the isoscalar s - wave processes @xmath4 and on the two - pion transitions of heavy mesons , when it is reasonable to consider that the two - pion pair is produced in the s - wave state and the final meson remains a spectator .",
    "we analyzed data on the charmonium decay processes  @xmath5 , @xmath6  from the crystal ball , dm2 , mark  ii , mark  iii , and bes  ii collaborations and practically all available data on two - pion transitions of the @xmath7 mesons from the argus , cleo , cusb , crystal ball , belle , and _ babar _ collaborations  @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xmath11 ) .",
    "moreover , the contribution of multi - channel @xmath0 scattering ( namely , @xmath4 ) in the final - state interactions is considered .",
    "the multi - channel @xmath0 scattering is described in our model - independent approach based on analyticity and unitarity and using an uniformization procedure .",
    "a novel feature in the analysis is accounting for effects from the @xmath2 channel in the indicated two - pion transitions which is assumed not only kinematically , i.e. , via including the channel threshold in the uniformizing variable , but also by adding the @xmath12 amplitude in the corresponding formulas for the decays .",
    "we showed that the experimentally observed interesting ( even mysterious ) behavior of the @xmath0 spectra of the @xmath7-family decays , which starts to be apparent in the second radial excitation and is also seen for the higher states ,  a bell - shaped form in the near-@xmath0-threshold region , smooth dips at about 0.6  gev in the @xmath13 , about 0.45  gev in the @xmath14 , and at about 0.7  gev in the @xmath15 , and also sharp dips near 1  gev in the @xmath13  can be explained by the interference between the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , in the final - state re - scattering ( by the constructive interference in the near-@xmath0-threshold region and by the destructive one in the dip regions ) .",
    "note that in a number of works ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) various assumptions were made to explain this observed behavior of the di - meson mass distributions .",
    "we have explained the basic shape of di - pion mass spectra in the two - pion transitions of both charmonia and bottomonia on the basis of our previous conclusions on wide resonances without any additional assumptions . in works",
    "@xcite we have shown : if a wide resonance can not decay into a channel which opens above its mass , but the resonance is strongly coupled to this channel , then one should consider this resonance as a multi - channel state allowing for this closed channel .",
    "we have considered the three - channel case of the multi - channel @xmath0 scattering , i.e. the reactions @xmath4 , because it was shown @xcite that this is a minimal number of coupled channels needed for obtaining correct values of @xmath3-resonance parameters . in the combined analysis ,",
    "the data for the multi - channel @xmath0 scattering were taken from many papers ( see refs . in  @xcite ) .",
    "for the decay @xmath19 data were taken from mark iii , dm2 and bes ii collaborations ; for @xmath20  from mark  ii and crystal ball(80 ) ( see refs . also in  @xcite ) . for",
    "@xmath21 data were used from argus  @xcite , cleo  @xcite , cusb  @xcite , and crystal ball  @xcite collaborations ; for @xmath15 and @xmath22  from cleo @xcite ; for @xmath23  from _ babar _ @xcite and belle @xcite ; for @xmath24  from belle collaboration  @xcite .    the di - meson mass distributions in the quarkonia decays are calculated using a formalism analogous to that proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the decays @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) which is extended with allowing for amplitudes of transitions between the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels in decay formulas .",
    "it is assumed that the pion pairs in the final state have zero isospin and spin .",
    "only these pairs of pions undergo the final state interactions whereas the final @xmath28 meson ( @xmath29 ) remains as a spectator .",
    "the decay amplitudes are related with the scattering amplitudes @xmath30 @xmath31 as follows @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; indices @xmath36 and @xmath37 correspond to @xmath38 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the free parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 depend on the couplings of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath38 to the channels @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the pole term in eq.(1 ) in front of @xmath49 is an approximation of possible @xmath50 states , not forbidden by ozi rules .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath30 are expressed through the @xmath51-matrix elements @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the reaction threshold .",
    "the @xmath51-matrix elements are taken as the products @xmath55 where @xmath56 represents the contribution of resonances , @xmath57 is the background part .",
    "the @xmath56-matrix elements are parameterized on the uniformization plane of the @xmath0-scattering @xmath51-matrix element by poles and zeros which represent resonances .",
    "the uniformization plane is obtained by a conformal map of the 8-sheeted riemann surface , on which the three - channel @xmath51 matrix is determined , onto the plane . in the uniformizing variable",
    "used  @xcite @xmath58 we have neglected the @xmath0-threshold branch point and allowed for the @xmath1- and @xmath2-threshold branch points and left - hand branch point at @xmath59 related to the crossed channels .",
    "resonance representations on the riemann surface are obtained using formulas in table  [ tab : anal.contin . ]",
    "@xcite , expressing analytic continuations of the @xmath51-matrix elements to all sheets in terms of those on the physical ( i ) sheet that have only the resonances zeros ( beyond the real axis ) , at least , around the physical region .",
    ".analytic continuations of the @xmath51-matrix elements [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ tab : anal.contin . ]",
    "the roman numerals denote the riemann - surface sheets , the superscript  @xmath60 is omitted to simplify the notation , @xmath61 is the determinant of the @xmath62 @xmath51-matrix on sheet i , @xmath63 is the minor of the element @xmath64 , that is , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , etc .",
    "these formulas show how singularities and resonance poles and zeros are transferred from the matrix element @xmath70 to matrix elements of coupled processes .",
    "the background is introduced to the @xmath57-matrix elements in a natural way : on the threshold of each important channel there appears generally speaking a complex phase shift .",
    "it is important that we have obtained practically zero background of the @xmath0 scattering in the scalar - isoscalar channel .",
    "first , this confirms well our assumption ( 5 ) .",
    "second , this shows that the representation of multi - channel resonances by the pole and zeros on the uniformization plane given in table  1 is good and quite sufficient .",
    "this result is also a criterion for the correctness of the approach .    in table",
    "[ tab : clusters ] we show the poles corresponding to @xmath3 resonances , obtained in the analysis .",
    "generally , _ the wide multi - channel states are most adequately represented by poles _ , because the poles give the main model - independent effect of resonances and are rather stable characteristics for various models , whereas masses and total widths are very model - dependent for wide resonances  @xcite .",
    "the masses , widths , and the coupling constants of resonances should be calculated using the poles on sheets ii , iv and viii , because only on these sheets the analytic continuations have the forms ( see table  [ tab : anal.contin . ] ) : @xmath71 respectively , i.e. , the pole positions of resonances are at the same points of the complex - energy plane , as the resonance zeros on the physical sheet , and are not shifted due to the coupling of channels .",
    "further , since studying the decays of charmonia and bottomonia , we investigated the role of the individual @xmath3 resonances in contributing to the shape of the di - pion mass distributions in these decays , firstly we studied their role in forming the energy dependence of amplitudes of reactions @xmath4 . in this case",
    "we switched off only those resonances [ @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , removal of which can be somehow compensated by correcting the background ( maybe , with elements of the pseudo - background ) to have the more - or - less acceptable description of the multi - channel @xmath0 scattering .",
    "below we therefore considered description of the multi - channel @xmath0 scattering for two more cases :    * first , when leaving out a minimal set of the @xmath3 mesons consisting of the @xmath72 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , which is sufficient to achieve a description of the processes @xmath4 with a total @xmath78 . * second , from the above - indicated three mesons only the @xmath72 can be omitted while still obtaining a reasonable description of multi - channel @xmath0 scattering ( though with appearance of a pseudo - background ) with the total @xmath79 .    in figure  1",

    "it is shown that the di - pion mass spectra in the above - indicated decays of charmonia and bottomonia are explained by the unified mechanism which is based on our previous conclusions on wide resonances @xcite and is related to contributions of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 coupled channels including their interference .",
    "it is shown that in the final states of these decays ( except @xmath0 scattering ) the contribution of coupled processes , e.g. , @xmath103 , is important even if these processes are energetically forbidden .",
    "accounting for the effect of the @xmath2 channel in the considered decays , both kinematically ( i.e. via the uniformizing variable ) and also by adding the @xmath12 amplitude in the formulas for the decays , permits us to eliminate nonphysical ( i.e. those related with no channel thresholds ) non - regularities in some @xmath0 distributions , which are present without this extension of the description @xcite .",
    "we obtained a reasonable and satisfactory description of all considered @xmath0 spectra in the two - pion transitions of charmonium and bottomonium .",
    "it was also very useful to consider the role of individual @xmath3 resonances in contributions to the di - pion mass distributions in the indicated decays .",
    "for example , it is seen that the sharp dips near 1  gev in the @xmath104 decays are related with the @xmath72 contribution to the interfering amplitudes of @xmath0 scattering and @xmath103 processes .",
    "namely consideration of this role of the @xmath72 allows us to make a conclusion on existence of the sharp dip at about 1  gev in the di - pion mass spectrum of the @xmath92 decay where , unlike @xmath94 , the scarce data do not permit to draw such conclusions yet .    also , a manifestation of the @xmath73 turned out to be interesting and unexpected .",
    "first , in the satisfactory description of the @xmath0 spectrum of decay @xmath5 , the second large peak in the 1.4-gev region can be naively explained as the contribution of the @xmath73 .",
    "we have shown that this is not right  the constructive interference between the contributions of the @xmath2 and @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels plays the main role in formation of the 1.4-gev peak .",
    "this is quite in agreement with our earlier conclusion that the @xmath73 has a dominant @xmath105 component @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it turned out that the @xmath73 contributes considerably in the near-@xmath0-threshold region of many di - pion mass distributions , especially making the threshold bell - shaped form of the di - pion spectra in the decays @xmath8 ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "this fact confirms , first , the existence of the @xmath73 ( up to now there is no firm conviction if it exists or not ) .",
    "second , that the exciting role of this meson in making the threshold bell - shaped form of the di - pion spectra can be explained as follows : the @xmath73 , being predominantly the @xmath105 state @xcite and practically not contributing to the @xmath0-scattering amplitude , influences noticeably the @xmath1 scattering ; e.g. , it was shown that the @xmath1-scattering length is very sensitive to whether this state does exist or not  @xcite .",
    "the interference of contributions of the @xmath0-scattering amplitude and the analytically - continued @xmath81 and @xmath12 amplitudes lead to the observed results .",
    "it is important that we have performed a combined analysis of available data on the processes @xmath4 , on decays of charmonia @xmath5 , @xmath107 and of bottomonia @xmath8 ( @xmath108 ) from the argus , crystal ball , cleo , cusb , dm2 , mark  ii , mark  iii , bes  ii , _ babar _ , and belle collaborations .",
    "the convincing description ( including also the @xmath2 channel ) of practically all available data on two - pion transitions of the @xmath109 and the @xmath7 mesons confirmed all our previous conclusions on the unified mechanism of formation of the basic di - pion spectra , which is based on our previous conclusions on wide resonances @xcite and is related to contributions of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 coupled channels including their interference .",
