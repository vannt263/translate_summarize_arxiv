    "recently , several approaches have been proposed to study the extent to which quantum fields may violate the `` weak energy condition , '' ( wec ) @xmath0 , for all timelike vectors @xmath1 .",
    "such violations occur in the casimir effect and in quantum coherence effects , where the energy density in a region may be negative .",
    "violations of the local energy conditions first led to the averaging of the energy condition over timelike ( or null ) geodesics@xcite .",
    "this eventually led to the `` averaged weak energy condition '' , @xmath2 here the total energy density averaged along an entire geodesic is constrained to be positive . while this does preserve in some form the weak energy condition , it does not constrain the magnitude of the negative energy violations from becoming arbitrarily large over an arbitrary interval , so long as there is compensating positive energy elsewhere . in cases such as the casimir effect , where there is a constant negative energy density present in the vacuum state , eq .",
    "( [ eq : awec ] ) fails .",
    "however , it is often still possible to prove `` difference inequalities '' in which @xmath3 is replaced by the difference in expectation values between an arbitrary state and the vacuum state .    quantum inequality ( qi )",
    "type relations have been proven which do constrain the magnitude and extent of negative energy .",
    "for example , in 4d minkowski space the quantum inequality for free , quantized , massless scalar fields can be written in its covariant form as @xmath4 for all values of @xmath5 and where @xmath1 is a timelike vector .",
    "the expectation value @xmath6 is with respect to an arbitrary state @xmath7 , and @xmath5 is the characteristic width of the sampling function , @xmath8 , whose time integral is unity .",
    "such inequalities limit the magnitude of the negative energy violations and the time for which they are allowed to exist . in addition , such qi relations reduce to the usual awec type conditions in the infinite sampling time limit .",
    "flat space quantum inequality - type relations of this form have since been applied to curved spacetimes by keeping the sampling time shorter than a `` characteristic '' curvature radius of the geometry . under such circumstances ,",
    "it was argued that the spacetime is approximately flat , and the inequalities could be applied over a small region . in the wormhole geometry , this led to wormholes which were either on the order of a planck length in size or with a great disparity in the length scales that characterize the wormhole . in the `` warp drive '' geometry @xcite it was found that if one wanted superluminal bubbles of macroscopically useful size then the bubble wall thickness would be of the order of a planck length @xcite .",
    "although the method of small sampling times is useful , it does not address the question of how the curvature would enter into the quantum inequalities for arbitrarily long sampling times .",
    "in this paper we will address this issue .",
    "we will begin with a generalized theory in section 2 which will allow us to find quantum difference inequalities in a globally static , but arbitrarily curved spacetime then in section 3 we will look at the case of the @xmath9 spacetime , the 3d equivalent to the einstein universe .",
    "we will show that the qi s are modified by a `` scale function '' which is dependent upon the ratio of sampling time to the curvature radius ( @xmath10 ) . in section 4",
    ", we will proceed to find similar qi s for the three cases of the 4d static robertson - walker spacetimes . in conclusion",
    ", we will discuss how awec type conditions in these particular spacetimes can be found .",
    "we will use units in which @xmath11 .",
    "in this section , we will develop a formalism to find the quantum inequalities for a massive , minimally coupled scalar field in a generalized spacetime .",
    "this method will be applicable in globally static spacetimes , allowing us to use a separation of variables of the wave equation , and write the positive frequency mode functions as @xmath12 the label @xmath13 represents the set of quantum numbers necessary to specify the state . additionally , the mode functions should have unit klein - gordon norm @xmath14    the above separation of variables can be accomplished when @xmath15 is a timelike killing vector .",
    "such a spacetime can be described by a metric of the form @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the metric of the spacelike hypersurfaces that are orthogonal to the killing vector in the time direction . with this metric , the wave equation is @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the scalar field @xmath20 can then be expanded in terms of creation and annihilation operators as @xmath21 when quantization is carried out over a finite box or universe .",
    "if the spacetime is itself infinite , then we replace the summation by an integral over all of the possible modes .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators satisfy the usual commutation relations .    in principle",
    ", quantum inequalities can be found for any geodesic observer . in the robertson - walker universes ,",
    "static observers see the universe as having maximal symmetry . moving observers",
    "lose this symmetry , and in general the mode functions of the wave equation can become quite complicated .",
