    "the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , the diffuse , isotropic background radiation from far - infrared ( fir ) to ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths , is believed to be predominantly composed of the light from stars and dust integrated over the entire history of the universe ( see * ? ? ? * for reviews ) .",
    "the observed spectrum of the local ebl at @xmath1 has two peaks of comparable energy density .",
    "the first peak in the optical to the near - infrared ( nir ) is attributed to direct starlight , while the second peak in the fir is attributed to emission from dust that absorbs and reprocesses the starlight .",

    "however , the ebl at higher redshifts is still highly uncertain .",
    "currently available theoretical models for the ebl can be broadly categorized into three types .",
    "first , in backward evolution models , one starts from the observed properties of galaxies in the local universe and describes their evolution by extrapolating backwards in time in a parameterized fashion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this extrapolation entails uncertainties in the properties of the ebl that inevitably increase at high redshifts .",
    "nevertheless , based on the observed , rest - frame k - band luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies from @xmath1 up to @xmath22 , @xcite were able to model the ebl without any assumptions for the lf .",
    "@xcite constructed evolving ebl models in a relatively robust way by utilizing multiwavelength photometric survey data .",
    "secondly , in forward evolution models , the basis is a description for the cosmic star formation history ( csfh ) , over which models for the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the stellar population are convolved to obtain the evolving ebl ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , such models can not follow the detailed evolution of key physical quantities such as the metallicity and dust content , which can significantly affect the spectral shape of the ebl . furthermore , although most forward evolution models employ the csfh of @xcite , it is known that this csfh model overproduces the stellar mass density @xcite , and is also inconsistent with the observed rate of core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "recent studies by @xcite show that @xcite may have overestimated the csfh at @xmath23 , arising from overcorrection for dust obscuration effects and in conversion from luminosity to star formation rate .",
    "finally , rooted in the modern cosmological framework of large - scale structure formation driven by cold dark matter , semi - analytical models of hierarchical galaxy formation account for the merging history of dark matter halos as well as the physical evolution of the baryonic component , including the effects of gas cooling , star formation , metal enrichment , feedback heating , etc . @xcite .",
    "such models successfully reproduce various observed properties of galaxies from the local universe up to @xmath24 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "at present , semi - analytical models can be considered the most detailed and well - developed models for the ebl over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "a subject that has yet to be fully explored in the context of the ebl and gamma - ray absorption is the epoch of cosmic reionization above @xmath24 .",
    "measurements of nir absorption troughs in the spectra of high-@xmath8 quasars , together with those of anisotropies in the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , prove that the majority of intergalactic hydrogen in the universe has been reionized somewhere between @xmath25 and @xmath24 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although the most widely suspected source of reionization is uv photons emitted by early generations of massive stars , the observational constraints are still very limited , so that the actual sources , history and topology of cosmic reionization remain largely unknown .",
    "a closely related topic is the possible existence and formation history of population iii ( pop - iii ) stars , very massive stars that are expected to originate in nearly metal - free conditions , particularly for the very first generation of stars appearing in the universe , and their potential role in cosmic reionization ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "since the current observational constraints on reionization mostly concern the neutral or ionized intergalactic gas , it would be very valuable and complementary to obtain independent information on the evolving , uv intergalactic radiation field itself .",
    "a unique and promising approach may be offered by the effects of gamma - ray absorption in - situ in high - energy sources at @xmath26 .",
    "uv radiation fields with sufficient intensities to cause cosmic reionization may induce significant gamma - ray absorption at observer energies above a few tens of gev @xcite . based on a semi - analytical model of galaxy formation that includes pop - iii stars and reproduces a variety of reionization - related observations@xcite ,",
    "the recent study by @xcite suggested that appreciable attenuation may be expected above @xmath27 gev at @xmath28 and down to @xmath29 gev at @xmath30 , mainly caused by pop - ii stars at these epochs .",
    "however , the relative contribution of pop - iii stars was found to be difficult to discern observationally . on the other hand , without addressing the implications for reionization , some studies have concentrated on the prospects for constraining pop - iii star formation through gamma - ray absorption in objects at lower redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "therefore a deeper investigation into the above issues is worthwhile and timely .",
    "the above studies @xcite have not accounted consistently for the ebl resulting from galaxy formation at lower redshifts .",
    "for example , the model of @xcite was optimized to describe the reionization epoch and did not include the contribution from pop - i stars or dust , and thus could only evaluate the gamma - ray opacity above @xmath22 .    in this paper , we present a new study of the ebl and consequent gamma - ray opacity , covering the entire redshift range from @xmath1 up to @xmath2 within a consistent framework , accounting for the process of cosmic reionization , and including pop - iii stars in a simplified way . as a baseline model",

    "the evolution of the baryons within halos is modeled with physically motivated , phenomenological prescriptions for radiative cooling , star formation , supernova feedback , chemical enrichment , and galaxy merging .",
    "we can compute a variety of physical and observational quantities for individual galaxies as well as the global average over the universe at any redshift , such as the csfh , and lfs and dust content of galaxies .",

    "<S> we present a new model of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) and corresponding @xmath0 opacity for intergalactic gamma - ray absorption from @xmath1 up to @xmath2 , based on a semi - analytical model of hierarchical galaxy formation that reproduces key observed properties of galaxies at various redshifts . including the potential contribution from population iii stars and following the cosmic reionization history in a simplified way , the model is also broadly consistent with available data concerning reionization , particularly the thomson scattering optical depth constraints from _ wmap_. in comparison with previous ebl studies up to @xmath35 , our predicted @xmath0 opacity is in general agreement for observed gamma - ray energy below @xmath4 gev , whereas it is a factor of @xmath5 lower above this energy because of a correspondingly lower cosmic star formation rate , even though the observed uv luminosity is well reproduced by virtue of our improved treatment of dust obscuration and direct estimation of star formation rate . the horizon energy at which the gamma - ray opacity is unity does not evolve strongly beyond @xmath6 and approaches @xmath7 gev . the contribution of population iii stars is a minor fraction of the ebl at @xmath1 , and is also difficult to distinguish through gamma - ray absorption in high-@xmath8 objects , even at the highest levels allowed by the wmap constraints . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the attenuation due to population ii stars should be observable in high-@xmath8 gamma - ray sources by telescopes such as _ fermi _ or cta and provide a valuable probe of the evolving ebl in the rest - frame uv . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed results of our model are publicly available in numerical form at the url http://www.slac.stanford.edu/%7eyinoue/download.html . </S>"
