    "in order to emphasize the importance of the boundary conditions , we first consider the case of an ising model on a square . in this case",
    ", the domains of reversed spins can nucleate from the corner .",
    "the barrier to nucleate a domain of spins paralell to the magnetic field is @xmath13 , where we have assumed that the domain of reversed spins is circular ( this is an approximation , since the droplets are not necesserily circular ) .",
    "the maximum over @xmath14 of @xmath15 is nothing but the barrier that need to be paid to reverse the magnetization .",
    "this barrier is @xmath16 . in order to compare with the absence of edges ( ising model on a disk )",
    ", we calculate the barrier to nucleate a domain of spins paralell to the field on the disk .",
    "we assume that the radius of the disk is large compared to the radius of curvature of the droplet .",
    "the barrier is given by @xmath17 .",
    "the first term @xmath18 is the energy term associated to the antiparallel links at the boundary and @xmath19 is the magnetic energy .",
    "@xmath20 is maximum for @xmath21 , which corresponds to the critical size of the domain . if @xmath22 , the domain has a trend to regress whereas it naturally grows if @xmath23 .",
    "the barrier height is @xmath24 .",
    "we see that the barrier in the presence of edges is one half of the barrier in the absence of edges , from what we conclude that the spin system on a square with open boundary conditions is very sensitive to the presence of edges and will first flip from the edges , at least if the magnetic field is not too strong . to check this assertion",
    ", we took a snapshot of the system during a given run .",
    "the result is pictured on figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is clear that the edges play an important role in the magnetization reversal , since the droplets are pinned at the edges , where the energy barrier is smaller than in the bulk .",
    "the pinning of the droplets is here purely geometric .",
    "one could also imagine that the droplets are pinned due to the presence of impurities .",
    "in what follows , we aim to elimitate the corner nucleation of domains .",
    "this is why we consider an ising model on a disk , with free boundary conditions .",
    "we call @xmath4 the time corresponding to the cancelation of the magnetization .",
    "we plotted on figure [ fig2 ] the distribution @xmath0 as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "we see that these distribution in very good agreement with gaussian distributions .",
    "this means that the distribution of relaxation times in an external magnetic field is gaussian , provided one uses the logarithm of the relaxation times .",
    "this result is in agreement with the assumption of @xcite . in the context of spin glasses",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath0 is gaussian .",
    "however , as we will see later , not all the assumptions of this phenomenological theory are valid in our model .",
    "since @xmath0 is a well defined gaussian distribution , we can study the variations of @xmath8 and of the variance @xmath9 as a function of temperature .",
    "we first begin with the mean value @xmath5 .",
    "the results for three different magnetic fields are plotted on figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "we observe that if the intensity of the magnetic field decreases , the relaxation times increase .",
    "moreover , if there exists a critical value @xmath26 f the magnetic field such that if @xmath27 , the relaxation times diverges in the zero temperature limit , whereas if @xmath27 , the relaxation times saturate in the zero temperature limit .",
    "we identify this behavior with the existence of the strong magnetic field regime of reference @xcite .",
    "the variations of the variance @xmath28 as a function of temperature are plotted on figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "these variations are qualitatively similar to the variations of the mean value : if the intensity of the magnetic field is too strong , we observe a saturation of the variance , whereas it diverges for weaker magnetic fields .",
    "we are now in position to study the variations of the mean value @xmath8 as a function of the variance @xmath9 .",
    "these variations are pictured on figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "we observe that in the strong magnetic field region , the variance and the mean value are quite small , and both tend to a constant if the temperature decreases to zero .",
    "by contrast , we observe that if @xmath29 , the curvature is negative , whereas it is positive if @xmath30 .",
    "it would be interesting to know whether experimental on magnetic grains could confirm these simulations .",
    "however , these data are not available at the moment , due essentially to the fact that it is necessery to repeat the experience a large number of times to obtain a good statistics , and also to the fact that the experiments are not carried out for a given magnetic field , in order to avoid very long relaxation times .",
    "if we compare our results to the prediction of spin glass theory @xcite , we do not find that @xmath8 is linear as a function of @xmath6 , and , according to the strength of the magnetic field , we find a positive or a negative curvature .",
    "we conclude that our model for thermal magnetic grains shares some common features with spin glasses since @xmath0 is found to be gaussian in both cases .",
    "however , whereas spin glasses phenomenological models predict a linear variation of @xmath8 as a function of the variance @xmath6 , we do not find here such a linear behavior .",
    "an other possible analysis of the data of the switching time experiment if to buid the histogram @xmath32 , and to fit the integrated histogram by a streched exponential @xmath33 this analysis is carried out on experimental data in @xcite , where the streched exponent @xmath31 is studied as a function of temperature .",
    "the main results are that @xmath31 increases with temperature , and may be superior to unity . as we shall see , our simulations agree with these two experimental facts . at this point",
    ", it should be underlined that the streched exponent @xmath31 has nothing to do with the streched exponent of @xcite in the context of spin glasses . in @xcite ,",
    "the autocorrelation functions of spin glasses are fitted by a streched exponential , and a streched exponent is deduced from the numerical data . in this case , the streched exponent is necessery inferior to unity , whereas in what we study , the streched exponent may be larger than unity .",
    "we show on figure [ fig6 ] the variation of the streched exponent @xmath31 as a function of @xmath7 , for two magnetic fields .",
    "it is clear that @xmath31 increases with @xmath7 , and may be superior to unity .",
    "we also observe that the streched exponent increases if the strength of the magnetic field increases , which is coherent with the fact both the mean value @xmath8 and the variance @xmath34 decrease if the strengh of the magnetic field increases .",
    "in the switching field experiment , a linearly increasing magnetic field is applied opposite to the direction of the initial magnetization , with a rate @xmath35 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath11 corresponding to the cancellation of the magnetization is measured . in order to analyze the data ,",
    "we follow reference @xcite , and use the phenomenological model of @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the average switching field @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 with @xmath38 @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are some constants , @xmath42 for an ideal single domain model and @xmath43 the experimental data consist of @xmath12 as a function of the temperature @xmath7 and the switching rate @xmath44 .",
    "the relation ( [ eq4 ] ) predicts the existence of a master curve for @xmath12 .",
    "we carried out numerical simulations for the square lattice on the disk , with open boundary conditions .",
    "we come to the conclusion that there exists a master curve for @xmath12 .",
    "the master curve is plotted on figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "we see that there exists differences between the master curve and the behavior @xmath45 .",
    "these deviations also exist in the experiments @xcite .",
    "we have carried out numerical simulations of a simplified model of magnetic grain in the thermal regime .",
    "we have carried two types of numerical simulations : switching time and switching field experiments .",
    "as far as switching time experiments are concerned , we found a gaussian behavior for the histogram @xmath0 of the logarithm of the relaxation times .",
    "this behavior is compatible with existing theories of slow relaxation phenomena .",
    "we find the existence of a strong field regime , where both @xmath8 and the variance @xmath46 tend to a constant as the temperature approaches zero .",
    "this regime was already predicted in @xcite , and called the strong field regime . if the magnetic field is smaller , the mean value and the variance diverge as the temperature approaches zero",
    ". it would be interesting to study the magnetic field @xmath26 , which separates the strong magnetic field region , as a function of the system size .",
    "it would also be interesting to carry out similar simulation for non euclidian boundaries , in order to have a more precise idea of the importance of boundary effects .",
    "to do so , it is possible to study the case of a hyperbolic lattice , or a cayley tree , with a finite fraction of the sites at the boundary even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "unfortunately , experimental data on magnetic grains are not available since these experiments require a large amount of data .",
    "we also calculated the streched exponent @xmath31 as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "like in the case of experiments , we find that @xmath31 may be superior to unity , and that @xmath31 increases with @xmath7 .",
    "we also considered the switching field experiment .",
    "there exists a master curve for the average of the switching field as a function of the switching rate and the temperature , which is consistent with the experimental data .",
