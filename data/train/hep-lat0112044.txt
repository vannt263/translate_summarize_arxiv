    "a key ingredient in flavor physics is the calculation of hadronic matrix elements of the electroweak hamiltonian .",
    "for example , one would like to calculate , from first principles , quantities such as leptonic decay constants , semi - leptonic form factors , and the amplitudes for neutral - meson mixing .",
    "numerical calculations with lattice qcd offer a way to obtain these quantities , eventually with well - controlled estimates of the numerical uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "the properties of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons are especially interesting , but the relatively large @xmath3 and @xmath4 quark masses make it difficult , with today s computers , to carry out lattice calculations in the limit @xmath5 for which lattice qcd was first developed .",
    "( here @xmath6 is the @xmath3 or @xmath4 quark mass , and @xmath7 is the lattice spacing . )",
    "one can , however , use the simplifying features of the heavy - quark limit of qcd to make lattice calculations tractable . as @xmath6",
    "is increased far above the typical scale of the wave function , @xmath8 , the hadrons wave functions depend less and less on  @xmath6 . as @xmath9",
    "the wave functions become flavor and spin symmetric  @xcite . for quarkonia",
    "similar simplifications occur , including spin symmetry  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we construct vector and axial vector currents with one quark heavy and the other light .",
    "these currents are needed to obtain the decay constants of heavy - light mesons , and the form factors for decays of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a charmed or @xmath3-flavored hadron ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , decaying to a light hadron  @xmath14 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ; @xmath18 , etc . )  and a lepton  @xmath19 and its neutrino  @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , we provide a way to treat radiative and power corrections consistently .",
    "this paper is a sequel to ref .",
    "@xcite , which focussed on power corrections . here",
    "we discuss the case of heavy - light bilinears in detail , and we compute explicitly the matching factors for the currents introduced in the `` fermilab '' formalism  @xcite .",
    "heavy - heavy bilinears are considered in a companion paper  @xcite .    to interpret lattice calculations when @xmath21 , it is convenient to describe cutoff effects with the symanzik local effective lagrangian ( le@xmath22 ) and expand the le@xmath22 s short - distance coefficients in powers of @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath24 , however , one should realize that it is not lattice gauge theory that breaks down but rather the symanzik description , especially its expansion in  @xmath23 . if @xmath23 is large because @xmath25 , then the simplifying features of the heavy - quark limit provide an alternative . instead of matching lattice gauge theory directly to continuum qcd , one can match to the heavy - quark effective theory  ( hqet ) or , for quarkonia , to non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) . in this approach ,",
    "the inverse heavy - quark mass and the lattice spacing are both treated as short distances , and a simple picture arises , in which heavy - quark discretization effects are lumped into short - distance coefficients .",
    "heavy - quark cutoff effects are systematically reducible , by adjusting the heavy - quark expansion for lattice gauge theory to agree term - by - term with continuum  qcd .",

    "we extend the formalism to heavy - light currents .",
    "we use the heavy - quark expansion , as generated by hqet , to derive matching conditions , which are valid for all @xmath23 and to all orders in the gauge coupling .",
    "our derivation is explicit for dimension - four currents , which is the next - to - leading dimension , but generalization to higher - dimension operators should be clear .    we also present explicit results for the one - loop radiative corrections to the normalization of the current .",
    "these calculations show that the temporal and spatial components of the current do not have the same radiative corrections .",
    "this feature has been found already  @xcite , and the hqet formalism shows why it arises . in deriving these results we have found a compact way of arranging the dirac algebra , which may be useful for calculations with actions , such as highly improved actions , that are not considered here .    as expected , the coefficients have a strong mass dependence .",
    "most of this dependence can be handled non - perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "for equal mass , it is simple to normalize the temporal vector current , for all masses .",
    "one can then form ratios of renormalization factors , from which the dominant mass dependence drops out .",
    "results for these combinations are also presented , in sec .",
    "[ sec : loop ] .",
    "our one - loop results extend those of ref .",

    "results for the wilson action  @xcite have been obtained first by kuramashi  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite a term in the currents , the so - called rotation term  @xcite , which is needed for tree - level improvement at order @xmath26 , was omitted .",

    ", similar methods have been developed to calculate the heavy - light matching coefficients for lattice nrqcd  @xcite .",
    "as in the symanzik program  @xcite , the advantage of introducing a continuum effective field theory is that the formalism provides a clear definition of the matching coefficients at every order in perturbation theory ( in the gauge coupling ) .",
    "indeed , it may also provide a foundation for a non - perturbative improvement program .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : match ] discusses three ways to separate long and short distance physics with ( continuum ) effective field theories .",

    "[ sec : loop ] we present one - loop results for the matching factors .",
    "some concluding remarks are made in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "three appendices contain details of the one - loop calculation , including an outline of a method to obtain compact expressions , and explicit results for the one - loop feynman integrands for the renormalization factors with the full fermilab action .    instead of printing tables of the numerical results in sec .",
    "[ sec : loop ] , we are making a suite of programs freely available@xcite .",
    "this suite includes programs for the heavy - heavy currents treated in our companion paper  @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss how to interpret the physical content of lattice field theories by matching to continuum field theories .",
    "first , the standard symanzik formalism for describing cutoff effects is reviewed , and we recall how this description breaks down for heavy quarks . after reviewing the hqet description of ( continuum )  qcd , we adapt hqet to describe lattice gauge theory .",
    "comparison of the two then yields a matching procedure that is valid whenever @xmath25 , and for all  @xmath23 . in the limit @xmath21",
    "both the hqet and the symanzik descriptions should apply , so we are able to derive relations between the some of the matching coefficients .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : lel ] ) omits dimension - five operators of the form @xmath37 or @xmath38 , for arbitrary  @xmath39 , which make no contribution to on - shell matrix elements , owing to the equations of motion implied by eq .",

    "a third remedy is to realize that it is the _ description _ , rather than the underlying lattice gauge theory , that has broken down .",
    "since lattice gauge theory with wilson fermions has a well - behaved heavy - quark limit  @xcite , it is possible to use heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) or nrqcd to describe short - distance effects , including the lattice artifacts of the heavy quark  @xcite .",
    "this last remedy is explained in detail in sec .",
    "[ subsec : hqetlat ] , where we show also how all three strategies are connected .",

    "hqet describes the dynamics of heavy - light bound states with an effective lagrangian built from  @xmath96 .",
    "so , for these states , one can say @xmath101 where @xmath102 for hqet @xmath103 contains terms of dimension @xmath104 .",
    "note that the ultraviolet regulator and renormalization scheme of the two sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcd = hqet ] ) need not be the same , although dimensional regularization and the @xmath105 scheme are usually used for both .    for this paper",
