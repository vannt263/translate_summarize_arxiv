    "the isospin constraints on the @xmath1 hadronic decay modes are known for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes@xcite . for the @xmath4 final states ,",
    "only the simplest decay mode @xmath5 has been studied . using the formalism of symmetry classes introduced by pais@xcite",
    ", we generalize the relations for an arbitrary value of @xmath6 and give a geometrical representation of the constraints .",
    "the @xmath7 system produced by a @xmath1 decay has isospin 1 ; the possible values of the @xmath8 isospin @xmath9 are 0 and 1 and the isospin @xmath10 of the @xmath6 pion system is 1 for @xmath11 and 0 , 1 or 2 for @xmath12 .",
    "since there is no second - class current in the standard model , interferences between amplitudes with @xmath13 and @xmath14 vanish in the partial widths @xcite .",
    "therefore we have the relation @xmath15 which is true for each charge configuration of the @xmath2 system , and , since @xmath16 , @xmath17 using the most easily observable states .",
    "the amplitudes are classified by the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . to complete the classification",
    ", we use the isospin symmetry class@xcite of the @xmath2 system i.e. the representation of the permutation group @xmath18 to which belongs the state .",
    "it is characterized by the lengths of the three rows of its young diagram @xmath19 . due to the pauli principle ,",
    "the momentum and isospin states have the same symmetry .",
    "thus integration over the momenta kills the interferences between amplitudes in different classes and there is no contribution from them in the partial widths .",
    "since @xmath20 and @xmath21 amplitudes belong to different symmetry classes@xcite , their interferences vanish .",
    "the presence of @xmath22 amplitudes makes the problem more intricate since they share symmetry properties with some @xmath21 or @xmath20 amplitudes @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case @xmath23 the symmetry class @xmath24 is shared by @xmath20 and @xmath22 ; in the case @xmath25 , the symmetry class @xmath26 is shared by @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the allowed domains in the space of the charge configuration fractions ( @xmath27 ) must be determined separately for each symmetry class and @xmath9 , taking interferences into account when necessary .",
    "the complete allowed domain is the convex hull of the sub - domains corresponding to the different @xmath9 and symmetry classes and its projections are the convex hulls of their projections .    for @xmath28 , which is always true in a @xmath1 decay , the isospin values and the symmetry class characterize unambiguously the amplitude properties @xcite , therefore there is , at most , one interference term per class .",
    "the sub - domain , for such a symmetry class associated with two different @xmath10 values , is then a two - dimensional one since the partial widths @xmath29 are linear functions of three quantities : the sums of squared amplitudes for the two values of @xmath10 and the interference term .",
    "its boundary is determined by the schwarz s inequality @xcite .",
    "this boundary is an ellipse ; it can be parametrized by writing the sums of squared amplitudes for the two values of @xmath10 as @xmath30/2\\,$ ] and the largest interference term allowed by the schwarz s inequality as @xmath31 , where the coefficient @xmath32 depends on the coupling coefficients .",
    "the most general domain is hence the convex hull of a set of points corresponding to the symmetry classes without @xmath22 and a set of ellipses .",
    "the cases @xmath23 and @xmath25 are presented in detail in the following sections .",
    "they both have the property that only one symmetry class is associated with two isospin values .",
    "higher values of @xmath6 are not expected , for some time , to be of experimental interest .",
    "the possible states that can be observed for a @xmath34 decay are the following :    @xmath35 + @xmath36 + @xmath37 + @xmath38 + @xmath39 + @xmath40 + @xmath41 .",
    "as mentioned before , not all the corresponding partial widths are independent and we can use the four fractions : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , whose sum is equal to 1 , to describe the possible charge configurations in a three - dimensional space .",
