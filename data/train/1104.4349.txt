    "there has been much energy expended towards resolving this problem , e.g. through null - energy - condition violating quantum fluctuations ( `` island cosmology models '' @xcite ) , quantum gravity effects , or effective field theory techniques .    a potential solution to the cosmological singularity problem",

    "non - singular bounces may be alternatively investigated using effective field theory techniques , introducing matter fields which violate the null energy condition @xcite or introducing non - conventional mixing terms @xcite .",
    "the extension of all the above bouncing scenarios is the ( old ) paradigm of cyclic cosmology @xcite , in which the universe experiences a periodic sequence of contractions and expansions , which has been reawakened recently @xcite , since it brings different insights to the origin of the observable universe @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .    along separate lines ,",
    "@xmath0 gravity has recently received attention in the literature @xcite , mostly in the context of explaining the observed acceleration of the universe .",
    "it is based on the old idea of the  teleparallel \" equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) @xcite , which , instead of using the curvature defined via the levi - civita connection , uses the weitzenbck connection that has no curvature but only torsion .",
    "the dynamical objects in such a framework are the four linearly independent vierbeins .",
    "the advantage of this framework is that the torsion tensor is formed solely from products of first derivatives of the tetrad . as described in @xcite , the lagrangian density , @xmath1 ,",
    "can then be constructed from this torsion tensor under the assumptions of invariance under general coordinate transformations , global lorentz transformations , and the parity operation , along with requiring the lagrangian density to be second order in the torsion tensor . however , instead of using the tensor scalar @xmath1 the authors of @xcite generalized the above formalism to a modified @xmath0 version , thus making the lagrangian density a function of @xmath1 , similar to the well - known extension of @xmath2 einstein - hilbert action . in comparison with @xmath2 gravity ,",
    "whose fourth - order equations may lead to pathologies , @xmath0 gravity has the significant advantage of possessing second - order field equations .",
    "this feature has led to a rapidly increasing interest in the literature , and apart from obtaining acceleration @xcite one can reconstruct a variety of cosmological evolutions @xcite and solutions @xcite , add a scalar field @xcite , use observational data in order to constrain the model parameters @xcite , examine the dynamical behavior of the scenario @xcite , and proceed beyond the background evolution , investigating the vacuum and matter perturbations @xcite as well as the large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "note however that there is a discussion whether forms of @xmath0 other than linear should be expected @xcite .",
    "one interesting feature of the @xmath0 theory is that the null energy condition could be effectively violated .",
    "accompanied with this feature , one expects to obtain a series of nontrivial phenomenological solutions .",
    "particularly , it was observed that the violation of null energy condition is related to the nonsingular bouncing solution in the early universe @xcite .",
    "therefore , the singularity avoidance can be obtained in general in @xmath0 gravity . in the present work we are interested in searching for a scenario of bouncing cosmology in the early universe , which is governed by @xmath0 gravity . as we show , the realization of a big bounce and the avoidance of singularities is straightforward . additionally , we investigate in detail the evolution of perturbations in a specific model of the matter bounce .",
    "our example illustrates that it is possible to generate a scale - invariant primordial power spectrum and pass through the nonsingular bouncing point in the context of @xmath0 bounce cosmology .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we briefly review the basic idea of @xmath0 gravity . in section",
    "[ matter bounce background ] we investigate the realization of bouncing cosmology by virtue of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "specifically , we postulate an explicit form for the background scale factor , and following this ansatz we reconstruct the corresponding form of @xmath0 both analytically and numerically . in section [ perturbation ]",
    "we study the evolution of cosmological perturbations of scalar and tensor types along with the matter bounce scenario .",
    "finally , section [ conclusion ] is devoted to the summary of the results .",
    "in this section we briefly review @xmath0 gravity and we provide the background cosmological equations in a universe governed by such a modified gravitational sector . throughout the work we consider a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background geometry with metric @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the cosmic time , @xmath5 are the comoving spatial coordinates , and",
    "@xmath6 is the scale factor . in this manuscript",
    "our notation is as follows : greek indices @xmath7 ... run over all coordinate space - time 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , lower case latin indices ( from the middle of the alphabet ) @xmath8 run over spatial coordinates 1 , 2 , 3 , capital latin indices @xmath9 ... run over the tangent space - time 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and lower case latin indices ( from the beginning of the alphabet ) @xmath10 ... will run over the tangent space spatial coordinates 1 , 2 , 3 .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the dynamical variable of the old `` teleparallel '' gravity , as well as its @xmath0 extension , is the vierbein field @xmath11 .",
    "this forms an orthonormal basis for the tangent space at each point @xmath12 of the manifold , that is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , the vector @xmath15 can be analyzed with the use of its components @xmath16 in a coordinate basis , that is @xmath17 .",
    "in such a construction , the metric tensor is obtained from the dual vierbein as @xmath18 contrary to general relativity , which uses the torsionless levi - civita connection , in the present formalism ones uses the curvatureless weitzenbck connection @xcite , whose torsion tensor reads @xmath19 moreover , the contorsion tensor , which equals the difference between the weitzenbck and levi - civita connections , is defined as @xmath20 finally , it proves useful to define @xmath21 using these quantities one can define the so called `` teleparallel lagrangian '' , which is nothing other than the torsion scalar , as hayashi79,maluf:1994ji , arcos:2005ec @xmath22 in summary , in the present formalism all the information concerning the gravitational field is included in the torsion tensor @xmath23 , and the torsion scalar @xmath1 arises from it in a similar way as the curvature scalar arises from the curvature ( riemann ) tensor .",
    "finally , the torsion scalar gives rise to the dynamical equations for the vierbein , which imply the einstein equations for the metric .",
    "while in teleparallel gravity the action is constructed by the teleparallel lagrangian @xmath1 , the idea of @xmath0 gravity is to generalize @xmath1 to a function @xmath24 , which is similar in spirit to the generalization of the ricci scalar @xmath25 in the einstein - hilbert action to a function @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the action in a universe governed by @xmath0 gravity reads : @xmath26,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 stands for the matter lagrangian .",
    "we mention here that since the ricci scalar @xmath25 and the torsion scalar @xmath1 differ only by a total derivative @xcite , in the case where @xmath0 is a constant ( which will play the role of a cosmological constant ) the action ( [ action ] ) is equivalent to general relativity with a cosmological constant .",
    "lastly , we stress that throughout this work we use the common choice for the form of the vierbien , namely @xmath29 it can be easily found that the family of vierbiens related to ( weproudlyuse ) through global lorentz transformations , lead to the same equations of motion .",
    "note however that , as was shown in @xcite , @xmath0 gravity does not preserve local lorentz invariance .",
    "thus , one should in principle study the cosmological consequences of a more general vierbien ansatz , but for simplicity we remain with choice ( [ weproudlyuse ] ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let us now present the background cosmological equations in a universe governed by @xmath0 gravity .",
    "variation of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the vierbein gives the equations of motion    @xmath30 -e_{a}^{\\lambda}t^{\\rho}{}_{\\mu\\lambda}s_{\\rho}{}^{\\nu\\mu } + s_{a}{}^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_{\\mu}({t})f_{,tt}-\\frac{1}{4}e_{a}^{\\nu } [ t+f({t } ) ] = 4\\pi ge_{a}^{\\rho}\\overset { \\mathbf{em}}t_{\\rho}{}^{\\nu},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote respectively the first and second derivatives of the function @xmath0 with respect to @xmath1 , and the mixed indices are used as in @xmath33 .",
    "note that the tensor @xmath34 on the right - hand side is the usual energy - momentum tensor .",
    "if we assume the background to be a perfect fluid , then the energy momentum tensor takes the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the fluid four - velocity . under this",
    ", one sees that equations ( [ eom ] ) lead to the background ( friedmann ) equations @xmath37 in these expressions we have introduced the hubble parameter @xmath38 , where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to coordinate time @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , @xmath39 and @xmath40 stand respectively for the energy density and pressure of the matter content of the universe , with equation - of - state parameter @xmath41 .",
    "finally , we have employed the very useful relation @xmath42which straightforwardly arises from evaluation of ( [ telelag ] ) for the unperturbed metric .",
    "in this section we examine how cosmological scenarios governed by @xmath0 gravity can produce a cosmological bounce .",
    "there are two distinct points in such an investigation .",
    "the first is to examine whether the background evolution allows for bouncing solutions .",
    "if this is indeed possible , then the second point is to examine the evolution of perturbations through the bounce .",
    "the first task is the subject of this section , while the second one will be investigated in the next section .",
    "finally , we mention that in order to be closer to the convention of the literature on this field , we use @xmath43 instead of @xmath44 when necessary , using the relation @xmath45 .    in principle , whether a universe is expanding or contracting depends on the positivity of the hubble parameter . in the contracting phase that exists prior to the bounce ,",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath46 is negative , while in the expanding one that exists after it we have @xmath47 . by making use of the continuity equations it follows that at the bounce point @xmath48 .",
    "finally , it is easy to see that throughout this transition @xmath49 . on the other hand , for the transition from expansion to contraction , that is for the cosmological turnaround , we have @xmath47 before and @xmath50 after , while exactly at the turnaround point we have @xmath48 . throughout this transition @xmath51 .",
    "having in mind the above general requirements for a cosmological bounce , and observing the friedmann equations ( [ background11 ] ) , ( [ background2 ] ) , we deduce that such a behavior can be easily obtained in principle in the context of @xmath0 cosmology .",
    "in particular , one starts with a specific , desirable form of the bouncing scale factor @xmath6 , and thus one immediately knows @xmath52 .",
    "concerning the matter fluid content of the universe , with equation - of - state parameter @xmath53 , its evolution equation @xmath54 straightforwardly gives the solution @xmath55 since @xmath6 is known .",
    "thus , we can insert these relations in ( background11 ) , and determine @xmath0 , that is @xmath56 , which generates such an @xmath52 solution .",
    "although this procedure can always be performed numerically , in the following we present a simple example of a bouncing solution that allows for analytical results .",
    "we start with a bouncing scale factor of the form @xmath57where @xmath58 is the scale factor at the bouncing point , and @xmath59 is a positive parameter which describes how fast the bounce takes place .",
    "such an ansatz presents the bouncing behavior , corresponding to matter - dominated contraction and expansion , and additionally it exhibits the advantage of allowing for semi - analytic solutions .",
    "in such a scenario @xmath4 varies between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , with @xmath62 the bounce point .",
    "finally , in the following we normalize the bounce scale factor @xmath58 to unity .",
    "straightforwardly we find @xmath63therefore , provided @xmath64 , the inversion of this expression gives the @xmath65 relation as @xmath66where we have kept the solution pair that gives the correct ( @xmath62 at @xmath67 ) behavior .",
    "notice that when @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 we have assumed the usual einstein gravity or the tegr to be the prevailing framework , thus negating the need to pursue an @xmath71 action in that region .",
    "furthermore , we assume the matter content of the universe to be dust , namely @xmath72 .",
    "when inserted in the evolution - equation , this leads to the usual dust - evolution @xmath73 , with @xmath74 its value at the bouncing point .    inserting the above expressions into ( [ background11 ] ) we obtain a differential equation for @xmath75 , which can be easily solved analytically as @xmath76~.\\end{aligned}\\]]we mention that in the calculation we have set the integration constant to be zero so that the solution is consistent with the friedmann equation .",
    "thus , the corresponding @xmath0 expression that generates a bouncing scale factor of the form ( [ at ] ) arises from expression ( [ ft ] ) with the insertion of the @xmath65 relation from ( [ tinvt ] ) .",
    "note that the solution ( [ ft ] ) is an even function of @xmath4 , and thus the @xmath77 solutions of ( [ tinvt ] ) correspond to the contraction and expansion phase respectively .",
    "obviously they give the same form of @xmath78 .     as a function of the torsion scalar @xmath1 in matter bounce cosmology .",

    "[ fig - foft ] we depict @xmath0 that generates the matter - dominated bounce in @xmath0 gravity , with @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "note that , the value of @xmath59 is roughly determined by the amplitude of the cmb spectrum , and that of @xmath85 depends on how fast the standard einstein gravity is recovered in the @xmath0 theory .",
    "their physical meanings will be discussed in the next section in detail .     in terms of the cosmic time @xmath4 in matter",
    "bounce cosmology .",

    "the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath74 were chosen to be @xmath86 and @xmath80 respectively , and the graph is in units of @xmath81 . _ ]    furthermore , we numerically derived the evolution of the @xmath0 and the hubble parameter @xmath46 as functions of the cosmic time in figs .",
    "[ fig - ft ] and [ fig - hubble ] respectively .",
    "particularly , fig .",
    "[ fig - ft ] shows that the evolution of @xmath0 is symmetric with respect to the bouncing point @xmath62 . at",
    "the bouncing point @xmath87 arrives at a minimal value @xmath88 , which happens to cancel the contribution of normal matter fields , and thus leads to the nonsingular bounce . from fig .",
    "[ fig - hubble ] , one can read that the background evolution of the universe follows the usual einstein gravity away from the bouncing phase , but it is dominated by @xmath0 in the middle period .",
    "these feature are completely consistent with the designs of the scenario as expected .",
    "in the previous section we presented a simple realization of the cosmological bounce in @xmath0 cosmology , at the background level . in this section we extend our analysis to an investigation of the perturbations .",
    "we begin with a brief discussion of the cosmological evolution of primordial perturbations in the framework of a flat frw universe .",
    "a standard process for generating a primordial power spectrum suggests that cosmological fluctuations should initially emerge inside a hubble radius , then exit it in the primordial epoch , and finally re - enter at late times .",
    "this process can be achieved in the matter bounce cosmology ( see for example @xcite ) . in this scenario there",
    "exist quantum fluctuations around the initial vacuum state , well in advance of the time when the bouncing point is reached . along with the matter - like contraction",
    ", the quantum fluctuations would exit the hubble radius , since the hubble radius decrease faster than the wavelengths of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "when passing through the bouncing point , the background evolution could affect the scale dependence of the perturbations at ultra - violet scales .",
    "however , the observable primordial perturbations , responsible for the large scale structure of our universe , are mainly originated in the infrared regime , where the modified gravity effect becomes very limited @xcite .",
    "consequently , in a generic case , one can estimate the formation of primordial power spectrum with the standard cosmological perturbation theory . in the following ,",
    "we study the perturbation theory in @xmath0 cosmology in detail and we verify this statement in a specific model of matter bounce cosmology .      to begin with",
    ", we shall work in the longitudinal gauge which only involves scalar - type metric fluctuations as @xmath89 thus , as usual , the scalar metric fluctuations are characterized by two functions @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "correspondingly , the fluctuation of torsion scalar at leading order is given by @xmath92 which will be widely used in the following calculation .    by expanding the gravitational equations of motion to linear order",
    ", we obtain the following perturbation equations @xcite , +    @xmath93\\phi & & \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{1+f_{,t}}{2a^2}\\nabla^2(\\psi-\\phi ) & = & 4{\\pi}g\\delta p~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the functions @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 are the fluctuations of energy density , pressure , fluid velocity , and anisotropic stress , respectively .",
    "we take the matter component to be a canonical scalar field @xmath98 with a lagrangian in form of @xmath99 and thus we acquire @xmath100 respectively .    inserting relation ( [ delta_s1 ] ) into ( [ delta_ij ] )",
    "one can obtain @xmath101 due to a vanishing anisotropic stress , which is also widely found in the standard theory of cosmological perturbations ( for example see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , combining ( [ delta_0i ] ) and ( [ delta_q2 ] ) implies that the gravitational potential @xmath102 can be completely determined by the scalar field fluctuation @xmath103 .",
    "therefore we conclude that for our choice of the tetrad given in ( [ weproudlyuse ] ) , there exists only a single degree of freedom in the scenario of @xmath0 gravity minimally coupled to a canonical scalar field .",
    "note that there is another evolution equation to describe the dynamics of cosmological perturbations , namely the perturbed equation of motion for @xmath103 .",
    "however , using ( [ delta_0i ] ) it can be shown that this second equation is consistent with ( [ delta_00 ] ) and ( [ delta_ii ] ) .    in order to understand the evolution of scalar - sector metric perturbations",
    ", we use the perturbed equation of motion for the gravitational potential @xmath90 instead of the scalar field fluctuation @xmath104 . combining ( [ delta_00 ] ) , ( [ delta_ii ] ) and",
    "( [ delta_0i ] ) we obtain the complete form of the equation of motion of one fourier mode @xmath105 as : @xmath106 with @xmath107 where we have applied the relation @xmath108 holding in the absence of anisotropic stress .",
    "the functions @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are respectively the frictional term , the effective mass , and the sound speed parameter for the gravitational potential @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , we recall the scalar - field background equation @xmath112 and the second friedmann equation ( [ background2 ] ) , which in our case reads : @xmath113 consequently , to make use of these two background equations , ( [ eom_phi_com ] ) can be further simplified as @xmath114 surprisingly , we find that the equation of motion for the gravitational potential in the present @xmath0 scenario is the same with that in the standard einstein gravity @xcite , except the newly introduced sound speed parameter",
    ". this important feature could be a key for us to explore potential clues of the @xmath0 theory in cosmological surveys .",
    "after having derived the equation of motion for the gravitational potential , we proceed in solving it in the detailed bouncing cosmology . as we showed in the background analysis of section [ matter bounce background ] , we can achieve the exact matter bounce scenario in which the universe evolves as a matter - dominated one in the contracting phase . in order to accommodate this picture",
    ", the matter component could be a massive scalar field similar to the mechanism of the lee - wick bounce @xcite , or a scalar field with a fine - tuned exponential potential @xcite .",
    "one often uses a gauge - invariant variable @xmath115 , the curvature fluctuation in comoving coordinates , to characterize the cosmological inhomogeneities . in the case of @xmath0 cosmology",
    "we assume that the form of @xmath115 is the same as that defined in the standard cosmological perturbation theory , which is given by @xmath116 a useful relation for the time derivative of @xmath115 can be derived upon making use of equation ( [ eom_phi_sim ] ) , namely @xmath117 in a generic expanding universe @xmath118 approaches zero at large length scales , @xmath119 , since the dominant mode of @xmath105 is then nearly constant . however , in the matter bounce cosmology the metric perturbation @xmath105 in the contracting phase is dominated by a growing mode with @xmath120 , and thus @xmath115 keeps increasing before arriving at the bouncing point @xcite .",
    "note that , one may be concerned of the variable @xmath115 becomes ill - defined when @xmath121 changes sign .",
    "in fact , this specious trouble was extensively studied in many aspects of cosmological perturbation theory . at present , our understanding on a well - defined cosmological perturbation theory is to require the metric perturbation and the corresponding extrinsic curvature behave smoothly throughout the background evolution .",
    "the pioneer discussion on this topic appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for recent detailed analysis by tracking the evolution of metric perturbation step by step in matter bounce cosmology . in our calculation",
    "we still make use of @xmath115 merely since its analytic analysis is very convenient to be performed away from the bouncing phase .",
    "in addition , we would like to point out that the knowledge obtained in general relativity can be also applied to @xmath0 gravity , which is a modification of einstein gravity , in the frame of bouncing cosmology .",
    "the reason is that the observable modes of perturbations in bouncing cosmology are distributed in the infrared regime and thus the effect caused by the modification of einstein gravity has to be very limited .    in order to simplify the calculation ,",
    "we further introduce a canonical variable to characterize the cosmological perturbations @xmath122 where @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "it can then be found that the equation of motion @xmath125 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the comoving time @xmath126 , is still available in a contracting universe .      in order to perform a specific analysis we recall that in the matter - like contracting phase the scalar factor evolves as @xmath127 and @xmath128 . in this period , by solving the background equations of motion , one obtains the approximate relations @xmath129 that hold far before the beginning of the bouncing era @xmath130 . as we mentioned above , @xmath85 is the energy density of the matter field at the bouncing point and @xmath59 describes how fast the bounce takes place .",
    "therefore , the sound speed of the curvature perturbation reverts to @xmath131 in the matter - like contracting phase .",
    "we mention here that inserting the @xmath0 form of ( [ ftmatter ] ) into the action ( [ action ] ) , we find that the standard einstein gravity will automatically be recovered when @xmath132 . particularly , when @xmath85 exactly equals to @xmath133 , we get @xmath134 , which will dilute faster than the ricci scalar during late - time evolution . even when @xmath85 is not equal to @xmath133 , it is clear that the system satisfies general relativity with a rescaled gravitational constant .",
    "thus , the combination of @xmath85 and @xmath59 could , in principle , be constrained by measurements of the gravitational constant . in our computation",
    "we choose @xmath85 to be slightly different from @xmath133 , thus our model is able to approach the standard einstein theory far away from the bounce .",
    "as a consequence , the perturbation equation becomes @xmath135 in the contracting phase .",
    "initially the @xmath136-term dominates in ( v_eom_m ) and thus we can neglect the gravitational term . from this point of view",
    ", the fluctuation corresponds to a free scalar propagating in a flat spacetime , and naturally the initial condition takes the form of the bunch - davies vacuum : . ]",
    "@xmath137making use of the vacuum initial condition we solve the perturbation equation exactly , obtaining the solution @xmath138from this result we deduce that the quantum fluctuations could become classical perturbations , after exiting the hubble radius , due to the gravitational term in equation ( [ v_eom_m ] ) .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the metric perturbations will keep increasing until the universe arrives at the bouncing phase at the moment @xmath139 .    from the definition of the power spectrum",
    "we see that @xmath140 is scale - invariant in our model , which can also be achieved in inflationary cosmology .",
    "however , the coefficient @xmath141 takes the value @xmath142 in the matter - like contraction and thus it is unable to amplify the power spectrum of metric perturbation as in inflation .",
    "a detailed calculation provides the expression of the primordial power spectrum for the @xmath0 matter bounce as @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the absolute value of the hubble parameter at the beginning moment of the bouncing phase .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath145 which appears in the power spectrum will become rescaled when @xmath85 is not equal to @xmath133 .",
    "we can now study the amplitude of tensor perturbations @xmath146 in the @xmath0 matter bounce .",
    "following @xcite , the perturbation equation for the tensor modes can be expressed as @xmath147while the tensor modes are transverse and traceless , namely @xmath148    in the specific case of matter bounce cosmology , equation ( [ h_eom ] ) is the same as the standard one since @xmath32 vanishes in the contracting phase .",
    "hence , following the analysis done in @xcite , the primordial power spectrum of tensor fluctuations is also scale - invariant , but the amplitude is @xmath149 , which is of the same order of the scalar perturbation .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 matter bounce scenario suffers from the usual problem of all matter bounce models , namely that the ratio of tensor to scalar @xmath150 is difficult to accommodate with current observations .",
    "in particular , from the current cmb data @xcite this ratio is required to be less than @xmath151 .",
    "consequently , in order to make our model consistent with cosmological observations on the value of @xmath152 , it is necessary to introduce a mechanism to magnify the amplitude of scalar - type metric perturbations .",
    "this issue can be resolved by introducing additional light scalar fields , as in the matter bounce curvaton scenario @xcite .",
    "these scalars are able to seed isocurvature fluctuations , and then transfer to a scale - invariant spectrum of the adiabatic fluctuations during the nonsingular bouncing phase , through the so - called kinetic amplification .",
    "thus , we obtain a mechanism for enhancing the primordial adiabatic fluctuations and suppressing the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "following the analysis performed in @xcite we can introduce one massless scalar field @xmath153 , coupling to the background matter field through the term @xmath154 .",
    "therefore , the tensor - to - scalar ratio in our model can be suppressed by the kinetic amplification factor in the bouncing phase , which can be expressed as @xmath155 as shown in equation ( 58 ) of @xcite .",
    "specifically , in our case the kinetic amplification factor @xmath156 is determined to be @xmath157 , and so @xmath158 .",
    "finally , by virtue of the matter bounce curvaton mechanism , our model is able to satisfy the constraints from current observations .",
    "in this work we investigated the realization of matter bounce cosmology in the framework of @xmath0 gravity . considering an explicit scale - factor form , which links the matter - like contraction and matter - like expansion through a smooth nonsingular bouncing phase",
    ", we reconstructed the specific form of @xmath0 that generates it .",
    "our analysis has illustrated the possibility of combining the @xmath0 gravity with bounce cosmologies , and thus exploring an alternative approach to avoid the big bang singularity encountered in the standard inflationary cosmology .",
    "additionally , the constructed @xmath0 matter bounce is free of ghost degrees of freedom and other potential problems of many matter bounce scenarios , which is a significant advantage .    at the background level",
    ", we found that the theory of torsion gravity is difficult to be verified by experiments .",
    "this is in agreement with the mechanism described in @xcite , where the torsion dynamics is highly degenerated with quantum corrections to the classical gravitational action caused by vacuum effects .",
    "however , going beyond the background level , we performed a detailed analysis of the evolution of metric perturbations in the present work . for our choice of the tetrad we found that the scalar - type metric perturbations posses a single degree of freedom , but they have a time - dependent sound speed , a feature that is generic in any @xmath0 scenario .",
    "we expect that this behavior could be an important signature to be detected or constrained by observations .",
    "the present @xmath0 matter bounce scenario suffers from the usual problem , widely existing in many other bounce models , namely it predicts a value for tensor - to - scalar ratio larger than observational constraints @xcite .",
    "this undesirable feature can be cured by the mechanism of matter bounce curvaton , which introduces an additional scalar field tracking the background evolution before the bounce , but with fluctuations obtaining a kinetic amplification during the bouncing phase .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that in order to establish the existence of matter bounce in @xmath0 gravity and perform a first examination of its basic features , we constructed a simplified scenario , without the incorporation of the contribution of radiation , dark energy and other matter components .",
    "therefore , the investigated scenario involves only two parameters , namely the energy density at the bouncing point @xmath85 and the bouncing parameter @xmath59 . through the perturbation analysis we found that these two parameters could be tightly constrained by cmb observations and experimental bounds on the newton s constant .",
    "it would be interesting to construct bouncing models in @xmath0 gravity going beyond this scenario , in which the contributions of other components would be taken into account and various cosmological observations would be satisfied .",
    "we leave such a construction of a phenomenologically realistic model and its observational constraints for a future investigation .",
