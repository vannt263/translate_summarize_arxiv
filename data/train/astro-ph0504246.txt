    "the dynamical state of a stellar system is completely described by its ` fine grained ' distribution function , @xmath10 , which refers to the phase - space density at point @xmath11 and time @xmath12 .",
    "the time evolution of the distribution function is governed by a continuity equation , known as the vlasov or collisionless boltzmann equation , @xmath13 here , @xmath14 denotes the gravitational potential , which for a self - gravitating stellar system is given by the poisson integral @xmath15 the main objective of galactic dynamics is to solve this system of equations .",
    "this is a difficult task and most analytic work is restricted to stationary or near - stationary solutions . for these a number of theoretical concepts",

    "galactic dynamics far from equilibrium on the other hand , such as in a galaxy merger or collapse , are almost entirely treated with @xmath5-body simulations , i.e.  numerical solutions of equations ( [ eq : cbe ] ) and ( [ eq : poisson ] ) .    as emphasised already by @xcite and @xcite , the constancy of @xmath10 ensured by the collisionless boltzmann equation  ( [ eq : cbe ] ) is of little practical use in non - equilibrium situations , because of _",
    "mixing_. phase - space elements of high density are stretched out and folded with elements of low density , very much as cream stirred into coffee .",
    "as for this example , the elements become ever thinner until any measurement of @xmath10 becomes impossible . in other words , the finite resolution of the system breaks the validity of the continuum limit .",
    "in such a case , the system is better described by a local average of @xmath16 , known as the _ coarse - grained _ distribution function @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , any measurement can only ( hope to ) recover this local average .",
    "there are important differences between mixing in a collisionless system such as a galaxy , and a collisional system such as a gas , where mixing is driven by short - range interactions . in galaxies ,",
    "strong forms of mixing are caused by non - local large - scale dynamics and occur only away from equilibrium but generally promote equilibrium .",
    "hence , mixing is never complete in the sense of convergence to a maximum - entropy state  in fact , it can be shown that such a state does not exist @xcite .",
    "a mild version of mixing is phase - mixing or similar ` weak mixing ' processes , caused by secular evolution of stellar systems ( for instance , the merging of regular orbits into a sea of chaos mixes their phase - space densities @xcite ) .",
    "stronger forms of mixing are ` chaotic mixing ' or ` violent relaxation ' , which is driven by large - scale fluctuations of the gravitational potential .",
    "a simple example of mixing is presented in figure  [ fig : mixing ] : volumes of @xmath18 ( black ) get stretched out ( e.g.  at @xmath19 ) and folded together with volumes of @xmath20 ( white ) until any distinction is barred by the finite resolution of any observation .",
    "so , while at @xmath21 in this example the fine - grained distribution function @xmath10 displays a very complex pattern , equilibrium is reached in the coarse - grained sense , since @xmath22 .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath23 does not obey a simple continuity equation , such as ( [ eq : cbe ] ) , and hence describing its evolution is a considerable problem .",
    "@xcite derived a distribution function for the end - state of violent relaxation assuming the conservation of phase - space volumes of given density according to equation  ( [ eq : cbe ] ) .",
    "however , mixing does not conserve volumes of fixed density in the coarse - grained sense ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , not surprisingly , the resulting theory is inconsistent @xcite . a similar attempt by @xcite suffers from the same deficiency @xcite",
    ". another approach to the dynamics of violent relaxation was taken by @xcite in deriving a time evolution equation for @xmath23 . while this is a promising attempt , its practicality is limited and unlikely to surpass that of @xmath5-body simulations .",
    "an obvious constraint on the evolution of @xmath17 is that its maximum value @xmath24 can not increase . while this is applicable",
    "only if @xmath25 is initially bounded , a much stronger constraint on @xmath17 is provided by a _ mixing theorem _ , a relation between the properties of @xmath25 before and after a mixing process .",

    "indeed , counter - examples to the mixing theorem can easily be constructed by tuning the coarse - graining @xcite .",
    "it seems that the problem arises from problems with the very concept of coarse - graining , which is lacking precise pre - conditions or even a precise definition .",
    "this does , however , not imply that a statement like the @xmath26-theorem can not generally be made or even that mixing was unimportant for stellar dynamics .",
    "i postpone a more detailed discussion of these issues to section  [ sec : coarse ] . ] .    according to @xcite , a function @xmath31",

    "this is a stronger statement than that of the increase of entropy , since it holds for all values of @xmath37 .",

    "this leads to a novel form of the mixing theorem in terms of a new concept , the excess - mass function , which is simple to apply and easy to interprete .",
    "i discuss the relation to @xcite s work and the controversy about it in section  [ sec : coarse ] . in section",
    "[ sec : ex ] , simple examples are given and the asymptotic behaviour at small and large values of @xmath23 corresponding , respectively , to large and small radii are considered .",
    "these are applied in section  [ sec : merger ] to the merging of cusped galaxies .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : nbody ] discusses the applicability to @xmath5-body simulations and section  [ sec : conclude ] concludes .",
    "in order to simplify the following discussion , it is worth introducing the ` volume distribution function ' ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) @xmath46 which refers to the phase - space volume at which @xmath47 . using @xmath48 , we can re - write the cumulative mass and volume and any @xmath26-functional as @xmath49 & = & -    \\int_0^\\infty v(\\phi)\\,c(\\phi)\\,{\\mathrm{d}}\\phi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath48 , @xmath41 , @xmath50 , and @xmath38 are functionals of @xmath25 as well as functions of their parameter @xmath4 or @xmath37 .",
    "we can now model mixing directly as an operation on phase - space volumes .",
    "the process of mixing and subsequent coarse - graining of the distribution function can be described as sequence of infinitesimal mixing events in which a phase - space element with infinitesimal volume @xmath51 and density @xmath52 mixes completely with another volume @xmath53 having density @xmath54 .",

    "since the whole mixing process is a sequence of infinitesimal mixing events , the change in @xmath2 is the integral over many infinitesimal changes @xmath66 and the lemma follows .",
    "the largest change of @xmath2 due to an infinitesimal mixing event occurs at @xmath67 and is @xmath68 .",
    "apart from the relations ( [ eq : df : v ] ) , ( [ eq : df : mv ] ) , and ( [ eq : df : v ] ) , the function @xmath2 has the following properties .",
    "first , @xmath69 since both @xmath48 and @xmath41 are non - negative , this implies that @xmath2 is non - negative and monotonically declining with everywhere non - negative curvature .",
    "second , since in order for @xmath70 not to diverge @xmath71 as @xmath9 , and because of equation ( [ eq : dddf ] ) , @xmath72    third , for a system with finite mass , @xmath73    fourth , changes in @xmath2 are related to a change of the entropy @xmath74 via @xmath75 which becomes obvious at the end of the next section .",
    "finally , the combined excess - mass function of several _ disjoint _ systems ( whose distribution functions do not overlap ) is simply given by the sum of the individual excess - mass functions .",
    "in general , i.e.  for partially overlapping systems , the excess - mass function is _ super - additive _ : @xmath76 this is directly related to the sub - additivity of the entropy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and follows from the definition ( [ eq : d : def ] ) of @xmath2 and the fact that @xmath77 .",

    "this is directly related to the fact that @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a time - like variable describing the evolution due to mixing . equation ( [ eq : dd : dm ] ) in conjunction with the theorem given by @xcite implies the following alternative form of the mixing theorem .

    "as mentioned in footnote  [ fn : coarse ] above , the @xmath26-theorem of @xcite has met immediate rejection @xcite .",
    "these authors provided simple counter - examples of non - mixing systems whose @xmath26-functionals are not conserved or even decreasing and pointed to the following conceptual problem in the argumentation .",
    "@xcite have actually only proven that @xmath26-functionals increase as consequence of coarse - graining : @xmath103\\ge h[f(\\bmath{x},\\bmath{v})]$ ] independent of the actual dynamics or indeed mixing . from that",

    "however , this argument does not guarantee that @xmath106\\le h[\\bar{f}(t_1)]\\le h[\\bar{f}(t)]$ ] at intermediate times @xmath107 .",
    "unfortunately , this controversy undermined the whole subject of mixing in stellar dynamics .",
    "some sceptics argue that the fine - grained distribution function never suffers information loss and hence that the @xmath26-theorem is a pure artifact of coarse - graining ( implying that the entropy of a collisionless stellar system is constant ) .",
    "this argument , however , relies on the infinite resolution of the fine - grained distribution function and ignores the fact that no stellar system can support infinite resolution . the fine - grained distribution function and the cbe only give an _ approximative _ description of collisionless stellar dynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the presence of mixing , the continuum limit , on which this approximation rests , becomes invalid .",
    "mixing is an irreversible process as information about the state prior to mixing is lost , representing a true entropy increase in the sense understood by boltzmann @xcite .",
    "the conceptual problems related to the @xmath26-theorem originate from the fact that the details of and requirements for the coarse - graining operation are not specified and hence are usually considered unimportant .",
    "many authors consider a static coarse - graining operation , such as averaging over time - independent macro cells or convolution with a window function .",
    "for such ways of coarse - graining @xcite showed that @xmath30 $ ] does not obey a @xmath26-theorem to be the sum of two @xmath108-functions .",

    "the reason is easily understood when considering a non - mixing non - equilibrium ( e.g.   periodic ) system . since the system evolves , the effectively resolved mass per fixed macro cell evolves too , so that @xmath30 $ ] is not necessarily conserved .",
    "in this situation , it is instructive to consider the proof of the @xmath26-theorem from the previous section . unlike @xcite s proof , it does not employ coarse - graining with finite macro cells .",
    "rather mixing is described directly as ( integral over ) averaging of infinitesimal phase - space volumes . in this description ,",
    "the astrophysical process of mixing ( and the resulting loss of information ) is accounted for , in our description of the system , by a local averaging , the coarse - graining .",
    "thus , mixing and coarse - graining are intimately related and the latter must not be considered arbitrary .",
    "this is directly related to the interpretation of the coarse - grained distribution function @xmath23 .",
    "traditionally , @xmath23 is introduced , because its fine - grained pendant @xmath16 does not tend to equilibrium , but undergoes ever stronger small - scale fluctuations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this picture",
    ", @xmath23 gives an otherwise unspecified , finite - resolution representation of the system .",
    "as already mentioned , the fine - grained fluctuations of @xmath16 will eventually break the validity of the continuum approximation , i.e.  below some level , these fluctuations are artificial and not representative of the actual stellar system .",
    "these arguments suggest the interpretation of @xmath23 as our _ best possible description _ of the stellar system , avoiding the artifacts of its fine - grained counterpart . in this interpretation",
    ", coarse - graining must meet the following conditions .    1 .",
    "[ cond : one ] in the limit of a system with infinite resolution : @xmath109 .",
    "[ cond : two ] @xmath23 must be a faithful representation of the system .",
    "[ cond : three ] in the absence of mixing : @xmath110 .",
    "the first two conditions imply that coarse - graining must be local .",
    "the second condition ensures that coarse - graining only deletes information in @xmath16 but not in our description of the stellar system , in particular @xmath111 .",
    "this means that coarse - graining is done on the local resolution scale of the system itself , which seems the most natural scale to use , but excludes static coarse - graining .",
    "in particular , any moment of the stellar system must agree ( within its statistical uncertainty ) with the corresponding moment of @xmath23 .",
    "finally , the last condition guarantees that @xmath23 is altered by mixing only , i.e.  under ordinary non - mixing circumstances all information about the system is preserved in @xmath23 .",
    "this immediately warrants the @xmath26-theorem .",
    "it is not clear , whether and how these conditions can be met in a practical implementation .",
    "however , even if we could only generate an approximation to this ideal , the above conditions and the underpinning interpretation were still valuable .",
    "for instance , we would allow for an approximation error @xmath112 ( with @xmath113 denoting approximation ) , which in turn might result in spurious but accountable violations of the @xmath26-theorem . clearly , a more detailed investigation of these issues is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we should stress that the idea of @xmath17 being the best possible description of the stellar system is not necessarily consistent with other approaches .",
    "for instance , @xcite ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) consider @xmath23 to contain a truly reduced information and , hence , the fluctuations of @xmath16 to be ( at least partially ) real rather than entirely artificial",
    ". it may be possible to reconcile this with our ideas by altering the above conditions to allow for a arbitrary resolution ( in terms of the mass or number of stars per resolution element ) without spoiling the @xmath26-theorem  however , then @xmath114 because of the forces generated by the fluctuations @xcite .",

    "for a non - self - gravitating system with density @xmath148 immersed in a gravitational field generated by an overall mass density @xmath149 with @xmath150 , one finds by a similar analysis @xmath151      the case of a stellar system whose dynamics is dominated by a super - massive black hole corresponds to @xmath152 in equation ( [ eq : non_self ] ) , i.e.  gives @xmath153 .",

    "together with equation  ( [ eq : cusp : df ] ) and the additivity , this yields @xmath188 thus , for @xmath189 ( i.e.  the remnant cusp containing the sum of the progenitor - cusp masses ) , the dilution fraction has to be @xmath190 independent of @xmath147 . for the remnant cusp to be equally massive as either of its progenitors , @xmath191 , which evaluates to 1 for @xmath192 , to @xmath193 for",
    "@xmath194 , to @xmath195 for @xmath196 , and @xmath197 for @xmath198 .",
    "thus , if @xmath186 is not strongly dependent on @xmath147 , relation  ( [ eq : merge : alpha ] ) suggests that remnants of steep - cusp mergers have more massive cusps , compared to their progenitors , than remnants of shallow - cusp mergers .",
    "however , since steeper cusps generate stronger tides , one would indeed expect @xmath186 to depend on @xmath147 in a sense opposing the above trend .",
    "one of the motivations of this study was the hope to use the excess - mass function as a diagnostic tool in the interpretation and validation of @xmath5-body experiments .",
    "to this end it is necessary to estimate phase - space densities from @xmath5-body data .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have demonstrated in two pioneering studies that this can in principle be done , even though it is a difficult task , because of ( i ) the vastness of 6d phase space and ( ii ) the lack of a metric .",
    "once estimates @xmath199 for @xmath23 at the phase - space positions of the bodies have been obtained , the excess - mass function may be estimated as @xmath200 where @xmath201 denotes the mass of the @xmath202th body .",
    "a serious problem in this game is that the coarse - graining scale used in the estimation of @xmath23 may well be larger than the scales still resolved by the system . as discussed in section  [ sec : coarse ] , this approximation error may result in unwanted surprises ( such as @xmath203 increasing with time ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fiestas ] demonstrates these problems when applying the phase - space density estimator fiestas of @xcite to @xmath204 points drawn from a hernquist ( @xcite ) sphere .",
    "the top two panels show that the estimated density can be up to two orders of magnitude wrong and is systematically too large for @xmath205 , while high densities are truncated , in particular when smoothing is used ( top panel ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the estimate @xmath206 obtained from equation  ( [ eq : d : estimate ] ) and the fiestas estimated densities with ( _ short dashed _ ) and without ( _ long dashed _ ) smoothing .",
    "a comparison with the true @xmath2 ( _ solid _ ) shows that the estimated @xmath2 is only slightly too large at intermediate @xmath4 , but is seriously in error at large @xmath4 ( and also at very small @xmath4 ) , in particular when smoothing was used .",
    "these errors are obviously related to the underestimation of large phase - space densities .",
    "this underestimation occurs at values for @xmath23 below those expected from the finite resolution with @xmath207 , since @xmath208 at @xmath209 and @xmath210 at @xmath211 .",
    "also plotted are the estimates from equation  ( [ eq : d : estimate ] ) using the true fine - grained phase - space densities of @xmath204 bodies ( _ dotted _ ) .",
    "these can hardly be distinguished from the true @xmath2 , indicating that equation  ( [ eq : d : estimate ] ) gives a fairly good estimator provided the estimates @xmath199 are good .",
    "these results suggest that , in order to resolve the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath2 at @xmath9 , at least @xmath212 points are required with this technique",
    ". clearly , there must be ways to improve the situation .",
    "apart from improvements in the existing technique , one may exploit that @xmath110 ( assuming no mixing is going on ) in order to constrain the possible values for @xmath199 .",
    "a stellar system out of equilibrium is driven towards equilibrium by way of _ mixing _ its phase - space densities in a process of violent relaxation . as a consequence",
    "the concept of the fine - grained distribution function @xmath213 is ill - suited to understand non - equilibrium stellar dynamics . instead ,",
    "the system is better described in terms of its coarse - grained distribution function @xmath25 .",
    "mixing of phase - space elements changes @xmath23 in such a way that the _ excess - mass function _",
    "@xmath214 decreases ( _ mixing lemma _ ,",
    "section  [ sec : mix : lemma ] ) , equivalent to a statement by @xcite .",
    "in fact , only events which mix densities @xmath215 with densities @xmath216 decrease @xmath2 . this lemma may be considered an extension of the well - known maximum phase - space density argument to all density values .",
    "@xmath2 measures the excess mass due to phase - space densities higher than @xmath4 and its decrease is directly related to entropy increase , see equation  ( [ eq : entropy ] ) .",
    "a useful property of @xmath2 is its additivity : the excess - mass function of the combination of disjoint stellar systems ( which do not overlap in phase space ) is simply the sum of the individual @xmath2 .    in section  [ sec :",
    "mix : theorem ] , i prove a novel form of the _ mixing theorem _",
    "@xcite , stating that @xmath2 decreases if and only if any @xmath26-functional of the distribution function increases .",
    "my lemma together with this theorem is an alternative proof of the @xmath26-theorem ( the increase of @xmath26-functionals due to mixing ) , avoiding some conceptual problems associated with allowing arbitrary coarse - graining .    in section  [ sec :",
    "coarse ] , the importance of details of the coarse - graining operator for the validity of the @xmath26-theorem are discussed .",
    "it is argued that the conceptual problems of @xcite s proof of this theorem can be avoided by requiring appropriate coarse - graining . in particular , i propose an interpretation of the coarse - grained distribution function @xmath23 as the best possible description of the stellar system . in this interpretation , the astrophysical process of mixing is directly described by coarse - graining and in the absence of mixing @xmath110 , such that the @xmath26-theorem is guaranteed .    in section  [ sec : ex ] , @xmath2 for some simple spherical equilibria is given and its asymptotic behaviour at small and large @xmath4 considered . for equilibria with a self - gravitating scale - invariant density cusp ( @xmath217 ) ,",
    "the asymptotic behaviour at @xmath9 is @xmath218 _ independent _ of the shape of the density contours and details of the distribution function .",
    "this remarkable property together with the additivity and the mixing theorem allowed me in section  [ sec : merger ] to prove that a merger remnant can not have a density cusp steeper than any of its progenitors . assuming that mixing during the merger does not become ever stronger at higher values of @xmath23 ( which can not be strictly excluded , but appears highly implausible )",
    ", one can show that the maximum cusp strength is conserved , i.e.  the remnant cusp has strength @xmath147 equal to the maximum of its progenitors .",
    "clearly , the decreasing nature of the excess - mass function is not restricted to galactic dynamics , but applicable to any collisionless system undergoing mixing .",
    "for instance , the inequality constraint used by @xcite ( @xcite , eq .",
    "33 ) to describe the evolution of the population of super - massive black holes is essentially equivalent to the mixing lemma . in this case , merging of super - massive black holes mixes the distribution of their properties .",
