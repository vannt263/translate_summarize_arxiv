    "<S> we investigate resonances in light halo nuclei using a fully microscopic cluster model and the complex scaling method . we make use of the hermitian representation of the complex scaling method . </S>",
    "<S> the general structure of the cluster model is that of a correlation operator acting on a starting function that describes a number of neutrons relative to an alpha - particle . the correlation operator is expanded in terms of a small non - orthogonal set of gaussian basis states and we make use of a simplified , central but state - dependent , interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the many - body integrals required for the computation are evaluated by a variational monte - carlo algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we show how to obtain resonant states for both @xmath0he and @xmath1he .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of resonant structures in loosely bound systems , such as halo nuclei , is an interesting area of nuclear physics that promises to be a rich source of information on many - body dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> there exists a variety of methods for analyzing such structures and in this work we consider an approach that belongs to the category of cluster models , which have proven to be powerful tools in analyzing the structure of such loosely bound systems . the most common way in which present cluster models describe the continuum structure of light nuclei is by treating only the most important degrees of freedom properly , and ignore the difficulties with the pauli principle that entails . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to such approaches , we employ a fully microscopic cluster model in order to provide a variational approximation to the schrdinger equation with , in this case , a slightly simplified nucleon - nucleon interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> a related microscopic cluster model that can deal with three - body resonances by complex - scaling in coordinate space was developed by csoto and applied to @xmath1he , @xmath1li and @xmath1be @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model can account in many cases both for the correct nuclear physics and proper three - body dynamics . among other results </S>",
    "<S> the authors predict the non - existence of the soft dipole resonance in @xmath1he . </S>",
    "<S> another example of a similar study of halo nuclei by the complex scaling method through a microscopic model can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative to the use of the complex scaling in coordinate space is to perform a contour deformation in momentum space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was applied at the level of a two - body problem and an extension to few - body borromean halo systems is in progress .    </S>",
    "<S> despite the success of the two- and three - body microscopic cluster models the existing fully microscopic ones have problems when considering resonances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ab - initio approaches , e.g. , the monte - carlo approach of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , even though very well suited for the bound - state problem , have difficulties describing resonances .    by using the complex scaling method @xcite in the ` direct approach ' , our model can handle resonances correctly in a straightforward way . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunction we employ is fully microscopic and is explicitly antisymmetrized so that the pauli exclusion principle is exactly satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> the general structure is that of a correlation operator acting on a reference function that describes a number of neutrons relative to an alpha - particle . </S>",
    "<S> we include a multiplicative jastrow factor for the short - range correlations and an additive configuration - interaction ( ci ) term for the long - range correlations . </S>",
    "<S> this last term only introduces pair correlations , whereas the jastrow term also includes higher correlations . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism has proved to be efficient in describing nuclear structure in various applications to closed and open shell systems , where all particles are treated on an equal footing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , this has also been applied @xcite to nuclei with @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> one advantage of the jastrow - ci scheme is the explicit inclusion of translational invariance and the fact that the correlation operators can be sufficiently well approximated by a small non - orthogonal basis set that makes application to heavier nuclei possible . for the moment we confine ourselves to central v4 interactions and in particular we make use of the s3 interaction of afnan and tang @xcite . for the computation of the many - body matrix elements we make use of the variational monte carlo method , which we have analyzed in detail @xcite as applied to this cluster model .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the cases of @xmath0he and @xmath1he . </S>",
    "<S> although experimentally @xmath0he is unbound while @xmath1he is lightly bound , the absence of spin - orbit force in our simplified force results in both nuclei being unbound . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , both nuclei exhibit a rich resonance structure . </S>",
    "<S> the current work thus provides an excellent testing ground for the study of resonances , even though the nuclear physics may not be wholly realistic .    </S>",
    "<S> there exists many different version of the complex scaling technique . in the original complex - coordinate method ( see , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) the resonance position @xmath3 and width @xmath4 are calculated from the complex eigenvalue @xmath5 of a non - hermitian hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the non - hermitian hamiltonian is obtained from the original one by a transformation of the particle coordinates . here </S>",
    "<S> we shall only use the most straightforward one , @xmath6 , where the angle @xmath7 is the scaling parameter . </S>",
    "<S> such a transformation leaves the bound states unaffected and rotates the positive energy scattering states by an angle of @xmath8 into the lower part of the complex plane relative to the threshold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> resonant states @xmath9 appear as complex eigenvalues in the lower half complex plane that are invariant with respect to changes in the scaling parameter @xmath7 , as long as this angle is large enough to uncover the resonances . </S>",
    "<S> [ a more detailed review of the complex scaling method can be found in @xcite . ]    for a complex scaled hamiltonian , the complex variational principle , unlike the conventional one , is a stationary principle rather than a minimum principle for either the resonance position or width . </S>",
    "<S> this is not very attractive , and moiseyev @xcite has formulated a representation of the complex - coordinate method in which the resonance position @xmath10 and width @xmath11 are variational parameters of a hermitian hamiltonian which gives additional stability , especially when working with small basis sets , as in this work . </S>",
    "<S> it is also gives a simple algorithm to follow the path of a given eigenvalue as @xmath7 changes . </S>",
    "<S> the variational method was reformulated by bylicki @xcite , into a simpler and more convenient form .    in this method , </S>",
    "<S> we first rewrite the complex scaled schrdinger equation as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the real and imaginary parts of the scaled hamiltonian @xmath15 . in matrix form this becomes @xmath16    since the exact eigenvalue of @xmath15 is unknown we can consider the alternative equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an approximation to the exact wavefunction @xmath19 . for a particular value of the scaling parameter @xmath7 the _ best _ choice of @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> is obtained by minimizing the size of @xmath20 , and @xmath21 if @xmath22 . within this approximation </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath23 that appear in @xmath24 no longer represent the exact real and imaginary parts of the complex energy but become variational parameters . </S>",
    "<S> thus in addition to the linear variational principle that is employed for the wavefunction we also have to vary @xmath10 and @xmath23 so as to minimize @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath20 has both positive and negative values one interesting property of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq2 ] ) is that the spectrum of eigenvalues is symmetric around 0 , thus if @xmath25 is an eigenvalue so is @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the equation @xmath27 is useful for obtaining bounds for the resonance position and width and it can be used in an iterative method for determining the values of @xmath10 and @xmath23 that minimize @xmath25 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the many body hamiltonian is of the form @xmath28 in this letter , we use a semi - realistic central nucleon - nucleon interaction ( v4 ) interaction that has the general form @xmath29 here the @xmath30 are the spin / isospin - dependent part composed of spin / isospin - exchange operators . </S>",
    "<S> the radial part of each channel potential is expanded as a sum of gaussian functions . </S>",
    "<S> we use the s3 interaction of afnan and tang @xcite .    for the trial wavefunction </S>",
    "<S> we consider the linearized approximation of the many - body wavefunction in terms of correlation operators acting on an uncorrelated reference function @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a translationally invariant description of the many - body problem and was applied to a number of closed - shell systems in terms of an alpha - cluster model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunction @xmath19 is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the reference function , that we take to be the product of the different cluster wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation operator @xmath33 is of the form @xmath34 this type of wavefunction ( referred to as the j - tici(2 ) scheme ) has been extensively used for the alpha - particle @xcite where it was shown to provide an adequate description for the ground - state properties . </S>",
    "<S> an important aspect of this approximation is the expansion of the correlation operator in terms of the non - orthogonal gaussian functions @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> only a very small number of components is required for a reasonable convergence , something that makes calculations in the j - tici(2 ) scheme less expensive than other microscopic methods .    </S>",
    "<S> due to the complexity of the correlation operator we can make use of the variational monte carlo method for the evaluation of the matrix elements , where the probability density function @xmath36 is taken to be the square of one of the components in the expansion of the wavefunction , i.e. , @xmath37 this is a natural choice for the pdf since the wavefunction can always be written as the product of @xmath36 and a function @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this is discussed in detail in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> thus eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) is approximated in terms of a non - orthogonal expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the non - orthogonality requires that in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq2 ] ) the real and imaginary parts of the complex scaled hamiltonian are modified according to @xmath39 @xmath40 represents the overlap matrix and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the matrix with the eigenvectors of @xmath40 as its columns and @xmath43 is the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of @xmath40 as its elements .     </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7-trajectories for the spectrum of the alpha - particle for various values of the rotation parameter @xmath7 between 0 and 0.65 radians . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the ground state corresponding to @xmath44 is -27.3 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold is not stationary but rotates into the upper quadrant of the complex plain , while the rest of the eigenvalues move clockwise into the lower complex plain.,width=377 ]    we firstly examine the application of the formalism of moiseyev and bylicki to the alpha - particle , where we do not expect to find any resonances . for the alpha - particle reference function </S>",
    "<S> we use the spherically symmetric harmonic oscillator ground state . </S>",
    "<S> it is an easy numerical calculation both in terms of computation time and complexity . </S>",
    "<S> we can go one step further by introducing one or two additional nucleons , corresponding to the cases of @xmath0he and @xmath1he .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally the alpha - particle is a stable nucleus with 20 mev difference between the ground and first excited state . </S>",
    "<S> searching for resonances is thus not extremely important , but the calculation will help to highlight the implications of the approximation scheme used . </S>",
    "<S> the results are displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold for this calculation is the ground state energy as obtained from the variational approximation ( @xmath45  -27.3 mev ) . as can be seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] the ground - state remains almost constant for small @xmath7 but when we increase @xmath7 further it eventually moves . </S>",
    "<S> this is not unexpected since the variational ground state is only an approximation to the exact threshold and it has a non - zero overlap with continuum states . </S>",
    "<S> it also suggests that we should optimize our basis to change with @xmath7in this context we are especially concerned about the jastrow factor . the rest of the eigenvalues move clockwise into the lower complex plane , eventually turning up as well . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of the threshold is somewhat of a worry , and shows that our variational form is not too good for finite @xmath7 . in all likelihood </S>",
    "<S> this is caused by the gaussian functions in the jastrow correlations ( i.e. , the short range behaviour of the wave function ) , but this requires confirmation . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , we expect all calculations to fail for @xmath46 , where all gaussians become oscillatory .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally @xmath0he is unbound by 0.798 mev and is observed as a @xmath47 resonance in the neutron scattering on @xmath48he . in our approximation </S>",
    "<S> the case of @xmath0he is that where a neutron is added to the alpha particle wavefunction , where the additional coordinates are specified relative to the alpha - particle center - of - mass . </S>",
    "<S> the additional neutron is placed within a spherical shell and the many - body wavefunction has the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a solid harmonic , while @xmath51 represents the spin and isospin degrees of freedom . in the function </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 the parameter @xmath53 represents the distance from the alpha - particle , while @xmath36 represents the width of the shell . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 is the relative distance of the neutron from the alpha - particle . </S>",
    "<S> the linear correlation operator is invariant under permutation of particle labels and can be taken outside the antisymmetrizer .     </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7-trajectories obtained for @xmath0he @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) for various values of the width parameter @xmath36 . in each plot the rotation parameter @xmath7 is varied in equal steps and the @xmath7-trajectories evolve from right to left as @xmath7 is increased.,width=302 ]    both @xmath53 and @xmath36 are variational parameters and in principle we can have a number of them , i.e. expand over a number of shells each placed at a different distance from the alpha - particle with a given width . however , as @xmath36 increases the value of @xmath53 becomes insignificant and we can consider a single shell provided @xmath36 is large enough . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained for @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) are illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , where we have plotted @xmath7-trajectories for various values of the variational parameter @xmath36 . for relatively small values of @xmath36 the trajectory is a smooth curve . as @xmath36 </S>",
    "<S> is increased this curve gains a turning point that eventually becomes a cusp ( left - hand part of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) . further increase of @xmath7 leads to loop - like trajectories ( right - hand part of the figure ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the smallest absolute difference @xmath57 between adjacent values of the @xmath7-trajectory for a particular value of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars are due to the monte carlo sampling . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath36 for which @xmath57 is minimum indicates the position of the resonance.,width=302 ]    in order to find the best @xmath7-trajectory we refer to the derivative of the eigenvalue with respect to @xmath7 . at resonance </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the energy is stable with respect to @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath58 . thus the best @xmath36 is that where @xmath59 is closest to zero . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , where we can see the minimum value of @xmath57 of the @xmath7-trajectory ( corresponding to the absolute distance between two adjacent points ) for a particular value of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a resonance is observed as the minimum value of @xmath60 that occurs in a range of @xmath36 between 5 and 6 . according to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] this corresponds to a cusp in the trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold for the problem ( which is not shown in this figure ) follows the trajectory for the @xmath48he ground state , as shown fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , closely . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests little influence from the halo structure , on this state , and little influence from this state on the continuous spectrum of @xmath0he . from the obtained @xmath7-trajectories we can infer a complex eigenvalue corresponding to a resonance in the region ( @xmath61 mev,@xmath62 mev ) , for @xmath63 . at this point </S>",
    "<S> the real part of the threshold has moved , but it has not developped an appreciable imaginary part . </S>",
    "<S> this movement means that the threshold subtraction is somewhat uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it seems most sensible to use the @xmath44 @xmath48he binding energy as threshold , @xmath64 mev . </S>",
    "<S> we thus find that a resonance 1.3@xmath650.5 mev above threshold with a width of @xmath66 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty arising from the anomalous movement of the threshold with @xmath7 is unknown , but as argued above probably small .    </S>",
    "<S> having ensured the applicability of the complex - scaling method to @xmath0he we proceed to the case of @xmath1he . in the case of @xmath1he </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally have a borromean nucleus : while @xmath0he is unbound , the @xmath1he ground state is stable . </S>",
    "<S> this state lies only 0.973 mev below the threshold for decay into an alpha - particle and two neutrons ( @xmath48he + @xmath67 ) and thus @xmath1he is very weakly bound . </S>",
    "<S> the first resonance of @xmath1he ( @xmath68 ) lies 1.797 mev above the ground state and has a strong decay to the @xmath48he + @xmath67 channel . </S>",
    "<S> we find no bound states in our calculation due to the lack of spin - orbit force in the simplified nucleon - nucleon interaction used . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can examine the structure of low - energy resonances in this light nucleus . in our model @xmath1he </S>",
    "<S> is described by two neutrons added to the alpha particle wavefunction , where the additional coordinates are specified relative to the alpha - particle center - of - mass . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the case of @xmath0he the two - neutrons are placed within a spherical shell , each parameterized in terms of a shifted gaussian with an additional term describing the interaction of the two neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a reference function , @xmath32 , that has the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the relative distance of the @xmath71th neutron from the alpha - particle , while @xmath72 is the relative distance between the two neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath73 is a solid harmonic that couples the two neutrons relative to the alpha particle to a total orbital momentum @xmath74 .     </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained for @xmath1he @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) for various values of the width parameter @xmath36 . in this case @xmath36 is related to the separation of the two neutrons that are placed in a shell around the alpha - particle . in each plot </S>",
    "<S> the rotation parameter @xmath7 is varied in equal steps and the @xmath7-trajectories evolve from right to left.,width=302 ]    the calculation is considerably more difficult than that of @xmath0he , because of the increase both in configuration space and in the number of variational parameters . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is sufficient to consider a restricted set of variational parameters for a qualitative understanding . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained look rather similar to those of @xmath0he . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , the separation between the alpha - particle and the dineutron center - of - mass is kept fixed , while the the separation of the two - neutrons , represented by @xmath36 , is varied . for small values of @xmath36 </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7-trajectories are smooth curves , while a cusp is observed when @xmath36 is sufficiently large . </S>",
    "<S> again , this eventually changes into a loop .    despite the qualitative nature of the results </S>",
    "<S> a clear resonant structure is obtained . in both @xmath0he and @xmath1he calculations </S>",
    "<S> only 9 components are used for the expansion of the correlation operator , and this is enough for providing convergence . </S>",
    "<S> the small basis set allows the calculations to be carried without any significant restrictions in the numerical method . </S>",
    "<S> the only difficulty that arises in going to heavier systems will be due to the explicit antisymmetrization . as a result of the hermitian representation of </S>",
    "<S> the complex variational principle is simple to obtain @xmath7-trajectories for the complex eigenvalues . in order to identify the resonance we use the condition that at resonance the complex energy should be stationary with respect to the scaling parameter . for the moment the results obtained are somewhat qualitative . </S>",
    "<S> although the numerical error due to the monte - carlo sampling is trivial for a particular point in the @xmath7-trajectories , the optimal value of the variational parameters ( e.g. @xmath36 ) that gives the resonance could only be obtained within a range . </S>",
    "<S> precise determination of that would require a much more elaborate calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> another point that needs further investigation is the fact that the basis set employed does not provide a fixed threshold for the alpha - particle . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that this will further influence the position of the resonance but is not clear at this stage in exactly what way . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the difference between the @xmath7-trajectories for the alpha - particle and those of @xmath0he and @xmath1he is quite profound . </S>",
    "<S> the position where the resonance occurs for both @xmath0he and @xmath1he is at a point where the motion of the alpha - particle continuum due to the scaling is clockwise into the lower complex plain . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is extremely unlikely that the resonance can be attributed to the anomalous behavior of the alpha - particle threshold .    </S>",
    "<S> we have examined the application of a fully microscopic cluster model to resonances in halo nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained low - lying resonances for both @xmath0he and @xmath1he by determining the point where the complex energy is stationary with respect to a scaling parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this is encouraging since experimentally it is expected that both systems have low - lying resonances .    </S>",
    "<S> the central outcome of our investigation is that the complex - scaling method can be successfully applied to our fully microscopic model for weakly bound nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> this was achieved with a relatively simple approximation , where the number of basis functions is quite small . within our framework of a non - orthogonal expansion it is convenient to make use of the variational eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq2 ] ) , rather than the standard complex variational principle . </S>",
    "<S> although both methods give the same results , the hermitian representation provides a systematic way of obtaining individual @xmath7-trajectories .    apart from resonances our method provides an interesting way to investigate the correlation mechanism used , which is widely applied ( jastrow - ci ) . </S>",
    "<S> despite the fact that such a correlation mechanism gives a good description of the bound - state properties of the alpha - particle , the ground state is not stationary under complex scaling . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the basis used to expand the correlation mechanism can be improved .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to obtain more accurate positions for these resonances and in the future we plan to improve and extend the calculation in order to get results of a more quantitative nature . </S>",
    "<S> this would include both increasing the accuracy ( more computer time ) , and obtaining upper and lower bounds ( as suggested in @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we are only interested in a qualitative understanding of the method . </S>",
    "<S> however , a more complete interaction can be used , which should lead to results comparable to the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the first natural step in extending the above work is to include a spin - orbit force in the nucleon - nucleon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that this will be adequate to produce a bound state for @xmath1he and at the same time allow the results for resonances to be of a more quantitative nature . </S>"
