    "such a dense matter can not be analyzed in laboratories , but it can be studied by astrophysical methods , in particular , by comparing theoretical calculations of the cooling of nss with observational data on their thermal emission .    the nuclear composition of the ns central layers is not known with certainty ( shapiro and teukolsky 1983 ) .",

    "in addition , the cooling can be controlled by possible superfluidity of neutrons and/or protons in the stellar core .",
    "superfluidity with a moderate critical temperature @xmath18 ( @xmath19@xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the temperature of the matter ) suppresses the neutrino energy losses but increases the heat capacity through the release of latent heat in a phase transition .",
    "strong superfluidity @xmath22 exponentially suppresses both the neutrino losses and the heat capacity of the ns .",
    "it is the interplay of these factors that may speed up the standard cooling or slow down the enhanced cooling .",
    "the main parameters of superfluidity that affect the cooling are the critical temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the transition of neutrons and protons , respectively , to a superfluid state . a rigorous calculation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the core of a ns requires a consistent many - particle quantum theory that adequately describes strong particle interactions . such a theory has not yet been constructed , but a large number of theoretical models of superdense matter have been proposed . the temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 calculated in various models ( see wambach _ et al .",

    "gnedin and yakovlev ( 1993 ) used these results and , following page and applegate ( 1992 ) , simulated numerically the enhanced cooling of a ns in the presence of neutron or proton superfluidity .",
    "the enhanced cooling with both @xmath5 and @xmath6 superfluidities at once was first considered by van riper and lattimer ( 1993 ) , who based their analysis on very approximate factors of suppression of the neutrino luminosity by superfluidity .",
    "a consistent calculation of the above factors was performed by levenfish and yakovlev ( 1994a , b ) .",

    ", we continue to study the cooling of neutron stars with a simultaneous superfluidity of nucleons . apart from the enhanced cooling , we also consider the standard cooling .",
    "the suppression factors for neutrino energy losses required for this consideration have recently been obtained by yakovlev and levenfish ( 1995 ) .",
    "our models are applied to the pulsar 2cg@xmath26 ( geminga ) .",
    "the effects of neutron and proton superfluidities on the standard or enhanced cooling of geminga were first investigated by page ( 1994 ) , who used approximate suppression factors for the heat capacity and neutrino energy losses .",
    "he showed that observations could be explained for any type of cooling by assuming that the stellar core was superfluid .",
    "we develop more detailed models of the ns cooling by including new data on the neutrino energy losses due to the proton branch of the process ( [ eq : murca ] ) ( levenfish and yakovlev 1993 , 1994a , b ; yakovlev and levenfish 1995 ) .",
    "we considered two models of a ns . in both cases , the equation of state of matter ( @xmath27 ) in the stellar core",
    "was taken from prakash _ et al . _",
    "the maximum mass of the ns for this equation of state is @xmath28 . in the first model ,",
    "the mass of the star is @xmath29 , the radius is 11.35 km , and the central density is @xmath30  g@xmath3@xmath4 . in the second model , @xmath31 , @xmath32  km , and @xmath33  g@xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "the chosen equation of state allows the direct urca process to operate at densities @xmath34  g@xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "thus , the first model corresponds to the enhanced cooling : the powerful direct urca process is possible in a small central kernel with the radius of 2.32  km and mass of 0.035  @xmath35 . in the second model , the critical density @xmath36",
    "is not achieved , and the star has the standard neutrino luminosity .",
    "we assumed that nucleons could be superfluid throughout the entire ns core .",
    "the proton superfluidity results from cooper pairing of protons in the @xmath37 state , while the neutron superfluidity is due to the neutron pairing in the @xmath38 state with zero projection of the pair s moment onto the quantization axis ( see , e.g. , wambach _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ) . the critical temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 can depend on density of matter and are not definitely known ( section 1 ) . for certainty",
    ", we assumed @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be constant throughout the stellar core .    for our cooling calculations",
    ", we used the program ( gnedin and yakovlev 1993 ; gnedin _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) in which the inner layers of the ns were assumed to be isothermal .",
    "this approximation is valid for a not - too - young ns ( @xmath39@xmath40  yr ) whose internal thermal relaxation has already occurred . following glen and sutherland ( 1980 ) ,",
    "the isothermal region was specified by the condition @xmath41  g@xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "the photon luminosity of the ns depends on the effective temperature @xmath42 of the stellar surface .",
    "the relation between @xmath42 and the temperature @xmath43 near the boundary of the isothermal region ( @xmath44 ) is determined by the thermal insulation of the outer envelope ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the magnetic field in the envelope causes the heat conduction to be anisotropic , resulting in an anisotropic distribution of @xmath42 over the ns surface ( see , e.g. , yakovlev and kaminker 1994 ) .",
    "even a relatively weak field @xmath46  g magnetizes degenerate electrons and reduces the heat conduction across * b*. this enhances the heat insulation of the ns in the vicinity of the magnetic equator",
    ". a stronger field , @xmath47  g , is quantizing both for a degenerate electron gas in deep layers of the envelope and for nondegenerate sub - photospheric layers .",
    "the effects of quantization of electron orbits generally increase the longitudinal thermal conductivity of degenerate electrons , reduce the pressure of degenerate electrons ( in the limit of strong quantization ) , and enhance the radiative thermal conductivity of nondegenerate layers . as a result",
    ", the quantizing field weakens the heat insulation near the magnetic poles .",
    "the ns cooling has been commonly calculated under the assumption that the magnetic field is radial in every point of the surface ( see , e.g. , van riper 1991 and references therein ) . in this case",
    ", only the reduction of the thermal insulation by the quantizing magnetic field was taken into account .",
    "recently , shibanov and yakovlev ( 1996 ) have considered the cooling of a ns with a dipole field by taking into account both the reduction of the thermal insulation near the magnetic poles and the enhancement of the insulation near the equator .",
    "both effects almost compensate each other for a field strength at the magnetic pole equal to @xmath48  g , and the cooling proceeds in the same way as for @xmath49 , although the magnetic field gives rise to a strong anisotropy in @xmath42 .",
    "our calculations are applied to the geminga pulsar ( section  1 ) whose magnetic field is close to the above value ( see , e.g. , bertsch _ et al .",
    "therefore , we neglect the effect of the magnetic field and use the relation between @xmath42 and @xmath43 derived by van riper ( 1991 ) for @xmath49 . in this approximation , by @xmath42 we mean the average effective surface temperature which determines the total photon luminosity of the star @xmath50 ( without allowing for the gravitational redshift ) . note that in the calculations of gnedin _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) , like in other calculations in which the magnetic field has been considered to be radial , the influence of the field on the cooling is highly overestimated .",
    "the neutrino luminosity of the ns with @xmath51 is mainly determined by the direct urca process ( [ eq : durca ] ) .",
    "the rate of the corresponding neutrino energy losses in normal ( nonsuperfluid ) matter was calculated by lattimer _",
    "et al .  _",
    "levenfish and yakovlev ( 1993 ) calculated the factors @xmath52 of suppression of the reaction ( [ eq : durca ] ) by the neutron superfluidity for normal protons ( @xmath53 ) and by the proton superfluidity for normal neutrons ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "they also calculated ( levenfish and yakovlev , 1994b ) the suppression of the reaction ( [ eq : durca ] ) by both superfluidities ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "it turned out that the reaction is mainly suppressed by the strongest superfluidity , @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "note that van riper and lattimer ( 1993 ) used the approximate suppression factors @xmath57 , which are especially inaccurate if @xmath58 .",
    "in addition to the powerful direct urca process , we also took into account the standard neutrino reactions ( [ eq : murca ] ) and ( [ eq : brema ] ) .",
    "the neutrino luminosity of the @xmath59 star is determined by both the modified urca processes ( [ eq : murca ] ) and the neutrino emission in nucleon collisions ( [ eq : brema ] ) in the entire stellar core .",
    "friman and maxwell ( 1979 ) considered the neutron branch of the modified urca process ( the process ( [ eq : murca ] ) for @xmath12 ) and the bremsstrahlung emission of nucleons ( [ eq : brema ] ) in nonsuperfluid matter . yakovlev and levenfish ( 1995 ) studied the proton branch of the modified urca process ( @xmath13 ) in nonsuperfluid matter and showed that this branch was almost as efficient as the neutron branch .",
    "note that the proton branch was commonly considered to be weak and excluded from calculations of the ns cooling .",
    "yakovlev and levenfish ( 1995 ) also calculated the suppression factors of the proton ( @xmath60 ) and neutron ( @xmath61 ) branches of the reaction ( [ eq : murca ] ) by the neutron superfluidity ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) for normal protons and by the proton superfluidity ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) for normal neutrons .",
    "the suppression factors for the reactions with the same number of superfluid particles turned out to be rather close if they were compared as functions of the corresponding dimensionless energy gap @xmath66 . here",
    ", @xmath67 is the energy gap for the proton ( singlet ) superfluidity , and @xmath68 is the minimum energy gap at the fermi surface of neutrons for the anisotropic ( triplet ) neutron superfluidity .",
    "thus , for example , the factors @xmath69 and @xmath70 are close to each other and to the factors @xmath71 and @xmath72 . taking this fact into account , we propose approximate factors of suppression of the neutron ( @xmath73 ) and proton ( @xmath74 ) branches of the modified urca process by a combined nucleon superfluidity",
    ". one can expect these factors as functions of the corresponding @xmath75 ( corrected for the number of superfluid particles involved ) to be not too different from the factor @xmath76 for the direct urca process .",
    "therefore , we use the approximate expressions @xmath77 and @xmath78 . if the protons are normal ( @xmath79 ) , the expression for @xmath80 becomes exact , while for normal neutrons ( @xmath81 ) the factor @xmath82 becomes exact .",
    "the neutrino energy loss rates in the nucleon - scattering processes ( [ eq : brema ] ) in nonsuperfluid matter are taken from friman and maxwell ( 1979 ) .",
    "the loss rate in the @xmath83-scattering is calculated from equation  ( 52 ) of this paper for the @xmath84-scattering with the neutron parameters replaced by the proton parameters ( see yakovlev and levenfish 1995 , for details ) .",
    "the factors of suppression of the @xmath83- ( @xmath85 ) and @xmath86-scattering ( @xmath87 ) by the proton superfluidity were calculated by yakovlev and levenfish ( 1995 ) .",
    "the similarity relations mentioned above allow us to propose the approximate suppression factors @xmath88 for the @xmath84-scattering by the neutron superfluidity and the suppression factors @xmath89 for the @xmath86-scattering by the combined nucleon superfluidity : @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "apart from the neutrino luminosity of the ns core , we take into account the neutrino luminosity of the crust resulting from the bremsstrahlung neutrino emission of electrons scattered by atomic nuclei . in this case , the approximate formula proposed by maxwell ( 1979 ) is used .",
    "the heat capacity of the ns is assumed to be the sum of the @xmath92 , and @xmath7 heat capacities in the stellar core ; we neglect the heat capacity of the crust because the crust mass is low in the chosen ns models .",
    "the effects of superfluidity on the @xmath5 and @xmath6 heat capacities were investigated by levenfish and yakovlev ( 1993 ) .",
    "when the superfluidity appears , the heat capacity experiences a jump due to the appearance of the latent heat .",
    "the proton ( singlet superfluidity ) and the neutron ( triplet superfluidity ) jump abruptly by factors of 2.43 and 2.19 , respectively . at @xmath93 ,",
    "the nucleon heat capacity is exponentially suppressed . in our calculations of the neutrino luminosity and heat capacity",
    ", we assume the effective masses of neutrons and protons in the ns core to be 0.7 of the masses of bare particles .",
    "we calculated about 1800 cooling curves for two ns models ( section  2 ) : with the masses @xmath51 ( enhanced cooling ) and @xmath94 ( standard cooling ) .",
    "each curve gives the temporal dependence of the effective surface temperature @xmath95 of the ns as detected by a distant observer , @xmath96 being the gravitational radius of the ns .",

    "typical cooling curves are plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "curve 2 corresponds to the standard neutrino losses ( @xmath94 ) in a ns with the normal ( nonsuperfluid ) core .",
    "the change in the shape of the curve at @xmath97  yr reflects the change of the cooling regime . for @xmath98 ,",
    "the ns is at the stage of _ neutrino _ cooling : the neutrino luminosity of the inner stellar layers is considerably higher than the photon luminosity of its surface . for @xmath99 ,",
    "the neutrino luminosity falls well below the photon one , and the _ photon _ stage sets in .",
    "owing to the low neutrino luminosity , the cooling proceeds rather slowly .",
    "curve 1 corresponds to the enhanced neutrino losses ( @xmath100 ) in the ns with a normal core . in this case",
    ", the ns cools much faster , with the neutrino - cooling stage being slightly delayed .",
    "the duration @xmath101 of the neutrino stage is mainly determined by the stellar heat capacity and by the dependence of the neutrino luminosity on the ns core temperature . for normal nucleons",
    ", @xmath102@xmath103  yr . a strong proton superfluidity with normal neutrons reduces the heat capacity and time @xmath101 by about ( 2030)% . for a strong neutron superfluidity and normal protons , the heat capacity and @xmath101 decrease by a factor of 2 to 3 . in the case of strong @xmath5 and @xmath6 superfluidities ,",
    "the heat capacity drops approximately by a factor of 20 , and @xmath104  yr .",
    "the results of our calculations are of general character .",
    "we will analyze them using the geminga pulsar as an example .",
    "recent observations of geminga from the rosat x - ray orbital observatory provide a wealth of information on the x - ray emission of this pulsar ( halpern and holt 1992 ; halpern and ruderman 1993 ; meyer _ et al .",
    "the emission consists of soft and hard components .",
    "the soft component is interpreted as the thermal emission from the geminga surface , while the hard component is commonly attributed to the emission of small hot spots on the stellar surface .",
    "theoretical interpretation of the observational data is ambiguous .",
    "thus , for example , halpern and ruderman ( 1993 ) described the soft and hard components by blackbody spectra with different temperatures and estimated the effective surface temperature to be @xmath105  k. the same authors fitted the soft and hard components with a blackbody spectrum and a power - law spectrum , respectively . in this model , @xmath106  k. meyer _",
    "( 1994 ) interpreted the emission of the hard component using a set of ns hydrogen - atmosphere models with a magnetic field .",

    "( 1995 ) have interpreted the spectroscopic observations of geminga using the model of a cool hydrogen nonmagnetic atmosphere ( @xmath109  k ) without a magnetic field in the presence of two small hot spots ( @xmath110  k ) with a radial magnetic field of opposite polarity .",
    "it should be stressed that the modeling of ns atmospheres is far from being complete .",
    "it is necessary to solve a complicated problem of radiative transfer in a magnetized , sufficiently cool and dense ( nonideal ) plasma of the ns atmosphere with a complex chemical composition ( hydrogen , helium , and heavy elements ) .",
    "it is quite possible that new models and observational data will yield slightly different values of @xmath42 .",
    "we will not favor any of the available interpretations , but consider the temperature @xmath42 as an unknown quantity .",
    "we will take @xmath107@xmath111  k as the most plausible temperature @xmath112 ( with allowance for the gravitational redshift ) .",
    "for the @xmath94 and @xmath51 models , the @xmath113 ratios are equal to 0.820 and 0.791 , respectively .    the age of geminga is estimated ( bertsch _ et al .  _ 1992 ; page 1994 ) from the observed rotation period @xmath114  s and its time derivative @xmath115  s / s using the well - known formula @xmath116 , where @xmath5 is the braking index . for the magnetic - dipole losses ( @xmath117 ) , @xmath118  yr . for @xmath119 , we have @xmath120  yr , which may be considered as the lower limit of the geminga s age ( page 1994 )",
    ".    we will assume the ranges of surface temperatures @xmath121@xmath122  k and ages @xmath123 ( fig .  1 ) to form an `` error box '' which the real cooling curves of the geminga pulsar must intersect .",
    "one can see that in the absence of superfluidity , the cooling proceeds more slowly than required for the standard neutrino luminosity and more rapidly than required for the enhanced luminosity .",
    "a detailed analysis made by page ( 1994 ) has shown that both the standard and enhanced neutrino luminosities fit the observations if the effect of superfluidity is taken into account .",
    "this assertion is illustrated by curves  3 and 4 in fig .  1 .",
    "curve  3 corresponds to the standard neutrino energy losses ( @xmath94 ) at @xmath124  k and @xmath125  k. such a superfluidity decreases strongly the heat capacity of the star and accelerates the cooling at the photon stage ( when the superfluid suppression of the neutrino luminosity is insignificant ) .",
    "curve  4 corresponds to the enhanced neutrino luminosity ( @xmath126 ) at @xmath127  k and @xmath125  k. the superfluidity chosen suppresses the neutrino luminosity more strongly than the heat capacity , and delays the cooling at the neutrino stage and at the transition stage from the neutrino to photon cooling .    with the inclusion of new data on neutrino energy losses and the ns heat capacity ( sections  1 and 2 ) ,",
    "our calculations extend the study of page ( 1994 ) to a wider range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in view of the great variety of the results ,",
    "their representation by cooling curves is inconvenient .",
    "it is more convenient ( gnedin _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) to display the critical superfluidity temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 which lead to definite effective surface temperatures @xmath112 of a ns of given age @xmath128 ( figs .  25 ) .",

    "3 and 5 correspond to the age @xmath130 .",
    "figures  2 and 3 correspond to enhanced neutrino energy losses .",
    "since the figures are similar , we will describe fig .  2 ( @xmath131 ) as an example .",
    "the lower left corner of this figure corresponds to the case where the critical temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 are below or of the same order of magnitude as the internal temperature of a ns of age @xmath129 .",
    "the nucleon superfluidity either has not yet appeared in or has had no time to strongly affect the cooling . as a result ,",
    "the ns surface temperature drops to @xmath132  k ( fig .",
    "1 ) through intense neutrino energy losses in the direct urca process , with the star being still at the neutrino cooling stage ( @xmath133 ) .    in all the remaining parts of fig .  2 , the effect of superfluidity on the cooling turns out to be crucial . calculations and a simplified analytic analysis of the cooling equations show that @xmath134 throughout the figure ( with the exception of the upper right corner of fig .  2 ) .",
    "in that case , the cooling is governed by both the neutrino luminosity and the heat capacity of the ns .",
    "the neutron superfluidity affects the direct urca process and the proton heat capacity in about the same manner as the proton superfluidity affects the direct urca process and the proton heat capacity ( levenfish and yakovlev 1994a , b ) .",
    "in addition , the heat capacities of normal neutrons and protons are comparable but considerably larger than the electron heat capacity . as a result , the curves in fig",
    ".  2 are almost symmetric with respect to the replacement of the coordinate axes , @xmath135 , and it is sufficient , for instance , to describe the lower right half of fig .  2 .",
    "if a low temperature of @xmath136  k is fixed and @xmath0 increases from @xmath137 to @xmath138  k , the proton superfluidity does not occur by the time @xmath129 , and the cooling is governed by the neutron superfluidity alone .",
    "therefore , the @xmath139 lines in the lower right corner of fig",
    ".  2 are vertical . as @xmath0 increases , the neutrino luminosity drops by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the heat capacity also changes but much weaker , because the strong @xmath5 superfluidity reduces the ns heat capacity only by a factor of approximately 3 . as a result ,",
    "variations in the neutrino luminosity are more pronounced than variations in the heat capacity .",
    "the cooling of the star slows down , while @xmath112 rises .",
    "if , on the other hand , we fix @xmath140  k and increase @xmath1 , then the @xmath6 superfluidity will arise in a star of age @xmath129 at some value of @xmath1 ( and the @xmath139 line will no longer be straight ) . as @xmath1 increases further , the superfluidity suppresses the neutrino luminosity and influences the heat capacity .",
    "however , the additional suppression of the direct urca process by a moderate proton superfluidity in the presence of a strong neutron superfluidity is weaker than the change in the proton heat capacity ( levenfish and yakovlev 1994a , b )",
    ". then the cooling is mainly controlled by the proton heat capacity .",
    "when the superfluidity arises , the heat capacity increases in a jump - like manner ( the latent heat is liberated ) , giving rise to an increase in @xmath112 : the @xmath139 lines are shifted leftward . however , the increase in the heat capacity is superseded by its sharp suppression with rising @xmath1 .",
    "the ns becomes cooler , and the isolines are shifted rightward .    finally , the critical temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the upper right corner of fig",
    ".  2 are so large that the neutron and proton superfluidities suppress the direct urca process and the nucleon heat capacity almost completely . for a very low ( electron ) heat capacity ,",

    ", the ns had long cooled down by the time @xmath129 through the photon emission , and its temperature is very low , @xmath141  k.    figures  2 and 3 , corresponding to the enhanced cooling of geminga , are similar to figs .   2 ,   4 , and 6 from gnedin _ et al . _",

    "it can be seen that the behavior of the isolines for the standard neutrino energy losses differs qualitatively from that for the enhanced neutrino energy losses ( figs .  2 and 3 ) .",
    "the principal difference lies in the fact that the relatively weak standard neutrino luminosity of a ns of age @xmath129 or @xmath130 turns out to be lower than the photon luminosity ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "the ns of the above age is at the photon - cooling stage virtually for all values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 shown in figs .  4 and 5 , and the neutrino luminosity of the stellar core plays no significant role .",

    "k ( lower part of fig .  4 ) , the protons are normal . if , at the same time , we raise @xmath0 , the neutron superfluidity will arise at @xmath150  k by the time @xmath129 . at @xmath151",
    "k , this superfluidity is moderate",
    ". the latent heat is released , and @xmath112 slightly rises . as @xmath0 increases further , the @xmath5 superfluidity becomes strong by the time @xmath129 ; it sharply suppresses the neutron heat capacity , and decreases @xmath112 .",
    "as @xmath0 rises , the @xmath5 superfluidity arises increasingly earlier . at @xmath152",
    "k , it appears at the early neutrino - cooling stage and is able to strongly suppress the neutrino losses and delay the cooling .",
    "though weakly , this delay manifests itself by the time @xmath129 : as @xmath0 becomes higher than @xmath153  k , the temperature @xmath112 slightly rises .",
    "if , however , we fix @xmath152  k and raise @xmath1 , the @xmath6 superfluidity arises at @xmath154  k. the latent heat is released , and @xmath112 grows . as a result , the @xmath139 lines in fig .  4 form loops ( e.g. , @xmath155 ) .",
    "at @xmath156  k ( left part of fig .",
    "4 ) , the neutrons are normal . if @xmath1 is raised above @xmath157  k , the proton superfluidity appears by the time @xmath129 . at @xmath158",
    "k , the superfluidity arises just before @xmath129 and is moderate .",
    "the heat capacity increases due to the latent - heat release , and @xmath112 slightly rises . as @xmath1 grows further , the @xmath6 superfluidity arises at increasingly earlier stages and becomes strong by the time @xmath129 .",
    "it suppresses the proton heat capacity , which amounts to @xmath159 of the total heat capacity of the ns for normal neutrons . on the other hand , this superfluidity exponentially suppresses the neutrino luminosity at the preceding neutrino - cooling stage .",
    "the slowdown of the cooling due to the suppression of the neutrino luminosity is more pronounced than the acceleration caused by an insignificant suppression of the heat capacity , and @xmath112 rises with increasing @xmath1 .    at @xmath160",
    "k ( upper part of fig .  4 ) , the @xmath6 heat capacity is suppressed completely",
    ". if @xmath0 is raised , the @xmath5 superfluidity appears by the time @xmath129 , which first enhances and then suppresses the @xmath5 heat capacity ( see above ) .",
    "this causes @xmath112 to initially rise and then decrease with a peak at @xmath161  k. if @xmath161  k is fixed and @xmath1 decreases , @xmath112 slightly drops .",
    "this drop of @xmath112 is caused by the enhancement of the stellar neutrino luminosity at the preceding neutrino - cooling stage . as a result , the @xmath162 curve forms , for example , a loop in the upper part of fig .",
    "the @xmath163 loop in the right part of fig .  4 is explained in a similar way ( with replacement @xmath164 ) .",
    "finally , at @xmath165  k and @xmath166  k ( upper right part of fig .  4 ) , the @xmath5 and @xmath6 superfluidities become strong by the time @xmath129 and heavily suppress the nucleon heat capacity .",
    "the neutrino - cooling stage is considerably shorter ( @xmath167 , see above ) , and the @xmath139 curves are entirely determined by a decrease in the heat capacity caused by superfluidity .",
    "the higher @xmath18 , the lower the heat capacity , and the cooler the star . at @xmath168",
    "k , the @xmath5 superfluidity suppresses the neutron heat capacity almost completely , and the cooling is governed only by a change in @xmath1 ( proton heat capacity ) at @xmath169  k. if , however , @xmath160  k , the @xmath6 superfluidity suppresses the proton heat capacity almost completely , and the cooling is governed by a change in @xmath0 ( neutron heat capacity ) at @xmath170  k. if the combined superfluidity of neutrons and protons is very strong ( @xmath171  k , @xmath172  k , see the uppermost right corner of fig",
    ".  4 ) , the nucleon heat capacity of the ns core is fully suppressed , and the cooling no longer depends on @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in this regime ,",
    "the cooling is governed by the electron heat capacity , which is independent of the nucleon superfluidity .",
    "it should be emphasized that the @xmath139 curves at @xmath173  k and @xmath166  k ( upper right part of fig .  4 ) are determined by an abrupt suppression of the heat capacity by strong superfluidity and are only slightly sensitive to the specific parameters of the ns . in the remaining region of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , variations in @xmath112 are small , but the @xmath139 curves ( for instance , loops ) may formally strongly deform with changing ns parameters ( cf .",
    ", the @xmath155 and @xmath174 isolines in figs .  4 and 5 ) .",
    "this deformation is not accompanied by large variations in @xmath112 and does not affect the main conclusions concerning the effect of superfluidity on the cooling .",
    "note that page ( 1994 ) considered a wider age range for geminga , @xmath175 , where @xmath176  yr corresponds to the braking index @xmath177 ( see above ) .",
    "we give no results for @xmath178 . in the case of the enhanced neutrino losses ,",
    "the corresponding figures are similar to figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "in the case of the standard energy losses , at @xmath178 , geminga is at the advanced photon - cooling stage , when the surface temperature is sufficiently low ( @xmath179  k ) even for normal nucleons ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "our calculations support the conclusion of page ( 1994 ) : observational data on the thermal emission of geminga can be explained by both the standard or enhanced neutrino energy losses if neutrons and protons in the geminga s core are assumed to be superfluid .",
    "figures  2 and 3 give the critical temperatures of the neutron and proton superfluidities , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which lead to specified effective surface temperatures @xmath112 of geminga if its age is @xmath180  yr or @xmath181  yr ( section  3 ) and the neutrino luminosity is enhanced by the direct urca process ( [ eq : durca ] ) .",
    "figures  4 and 5 are similar but correspond to the assumption that the neutrino luminosity is standard and results from the reactions ( [ eq : murca ] ) and ( [ eq : brema ] ) .",
    "observational data on the x - ray emission of geminga ( section  3 ) indicate that its effective surface temperature @xmath112 ranges from @xmath182  k to @xmath183  k.    both assumptions about the neutrino energy losses ( standard and enhanced ) can be reconciled with observational data . in both cases ,",
    "the required values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are in qualitative agreement with various model calculations of the critical temperatures of nucleon superfluidity in ns cores ( see page and applegate 1992 , for references ) . however , the properties of superfluidity in the geminga s core for the standard and enhanced neutrino luminosities must greatly differ . in the case of the enhanced neutrino luminosity",
    ", the superfluidity is needed to slow down the ns cooling at the neutrino - cooling stage ( or at the transition stage from the neutrino to photon luminosity ) through a partial suppression of the neutrino energy losses in the direct urca process .",
    "for example , the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 that give the geminga s surface temperature @xmath184@xmath185  k lie ( see figs .  2 and 3 ) in two relatively wide decoupled regions in the ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) plane . for the standard neutrino processes ,",
    "the superfluidity must slow down the cooling at the photon - cooling stage through the suppression of the stellar heat capacity .",
    "the region of the necessary values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( figs .  4 and 5 ) turns out to be much narrower and coupled . for the same @xmath112",
    ", we obtain @xmath186 and @xmath187 . in this case , the constraints on possible values of critical temperatures are much more stringent . on the whole , the model of the standard neutrino losses requires higher @xmath0 and @xmath1 than the model of the enhanced losses .",
    "the results of our calculations are tentative .",
    "more detailed models for the cooling of nss with superfluid cores are needed .",
    "first , it would be desirable to allow for the nonuniform distribution of the critical temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( for their density dependence ) throughout the stellar core .",
    "for this to be done , joint theoretical calculations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are necessary for various models of superdense matter ( which are now not available ) .",
    "these data could be used to directly determine the best - fit models without assuming that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are free parameters .",
    "it would be desirable to consider the cases where other particles , above all , muons and hyperons , are present in the ns cores along with neutrons , protons and electrons . note that the neutrino - loss rates in various types of reaction are also sensitive to superdense - matter models and have not yet been determined with confidence . at the late cooling stage , additional heating sources may also be important , for example , those related to dissipation of the rotational energy in the core of a star during its slowdown ( see , e.g. , cheng _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 , umeda _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "one may hope that new observational data on the thermal emission of nss together with new theoretical calculations will make it possible to obtain more stringent constraints on the rate of neutrino energy losses and the critical temperatures of nucleon superfluidity in superdense matter .",
