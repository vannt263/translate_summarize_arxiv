    "the opera experiment , located in the gran sasso underground laboratory ( lngs ) in italy , is a long - baseline experiment designed to obtain an unambiguous signature of @xmath1 oscillations in the parameter region indicated by the atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "the detector developed by the international collaboration opera is designed to search primary for @xmath2 appearance in the high energy @xmath3 cern to gran sasso ( cngs ) beam at 730 km from the neutrino source .",
    "it may also explore the @xmath4 oscillation channel and improve the limits on the third yet unknown mixing angle @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath2 direct appearance search is based on the observation of charge current interaction ( cc ) events with the @xmath0 decaying through leptonic and hadronic channels .",
    "the principle of the opera experiment is to observe the @xmath0 trajectories and the decay products . because the weak neutrino cross section and the short @xmath0 lifetime , the opera detector must combine a huge mass with a high granularity which can be achieved by using nuclear emulsions .",
    "the opera detector is composed of two identical parts called super module ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "each sm has a target section and a muon spectrometer [ fig .",
    "[ figdetec ]     the target section is composed of 29 vertical supporting steel structures called walls .",
    "the walls contain the basic target detector units called emulsion cloud chambers ( ecc ) brick .",
    "the total opera target contains 150036 ecc bricks with a total mass of 1.25 ktons .",
    "each ecc brick is a sequence of 57 emulsion films interleaved with 56 lead plates ( 1 mm thick ) .",
    "an emulsion film is composed of a pair of 44 @xmath6 thick emulsion layers deposited on a 205 @xmath6 plastic base .",
    "the ecc bricks have been assembled underground at an average rate of 700 per day by a dedicated fully automated brick assembly machine ( bam ) and the opera target has been filled by using two automated manipulator systems ( bms ) .",
    "downstream of each brick [ fig .",
    "2 ] , an emulsion film doublet called changeable sheet ( cs ) is attached in a separate enveloppe .",
    "the cs doublet can be detached from the brick for analysis to confirm and locate the tracks produced in the electronic detectors by neutrino interactions .",
    "the cs doublet is the interface between the ecc brick and the electronic detector .",
    "indeed , each wall is interleaved with a double layered wall of scintillator strips .",
    "this electronic detector called target tracker ( tt ) also provides a trigger for the neutrino interactions .",
    "the spectrometer allows the determination of the muons charge and momentum by measuring their curvature in a dipolar magnet made of iron .",
    "each spectrometer is equipped with rpc bakelite chambers and high precision tracker ( hpt ) composed of drift - tubes .",
    "the spectrometer reduces the charge confusion to less than 0.3 % , gives a muon momentum measurement better than 20% for a momentum less than 50 gev and reaches a muon identification efficiency of 95 % .",
    "[ figbrickcs ]",
    "the cern to gran sasso ( cngs ) @xmath3 beam is designed and optimized to maximize the number of charged current interactions of @xmath2 produced by oscillation at lngs . with @xmath7 protons on target per year ,",
    "the number of cc and neutral current ( nc ) interactions expected in the gran sasso laboratory from @xmath8 are respectively about 2900 per kton per year and 875 per kton per year . if the @xmath9 oscillation hypothesis is confirmed , the number of @xmath0 s observed in the opera detector after 5 years of data taking is expected to be 10 events with a background of 0.75 events for a @xmath10 at full mixing .",
    "the opera detector events are synchronized with the cngs beam using a sophisticated gps system .",
    "for a given event , the electronic detectors give the map of probable locations for the interaction brick . the brick with the highest probability",
    "is extracted by the bms .",
    "then the cs doublet is detached from the brick and developed in the underground facility .",
    "the two emulsion films are scanned by using fast automated microscopes .",
    "if the track candidates found on the cs doublet match with the electronic data then the brick is exposed for 12 hours to cosmic rays in order to help with the film - to - film alignment in the brick .",
    "subsequently the brick is developed in an automated facility and sent to the scanning laboratories either in europe or in japan .",
    "the brick scanning is done by computer driven fast microscopes .",
    "the vertex finding strategy consists in following back , film by film , the tracks found on the cs doublet untill the tracks stop inside the brick .",
    "the scanning speed can reach up to 20 @xmath11 while keeping a good spatial and angular resolution . to confirm the stopping track ,",
    "an area scan of several @xmath12 around the stopping point of the tracks is performed for 5 films upstream and downstream .",
    "then a vertex interaction can be reconstructed and a topology compatible with the decay of a @xmath0 lepton is searched for .",
    "after a short commissioning run in 2006 , the cngs operation started on september 2007 at rather low intensity with 40% of the total opera target mass . since the cngs encountered operational problems",
    "the physics run lasted only a few days . during this run @xmath13 protons on target ( p.o.t . ) were accumulated and 465 events were recorded , of which 35 in the target region .    from june to november 2008 , @xmath14 p.o.t .",
    "were delivered by the cngs @xcite .",
    "opera collected 10100 events and among them 1663 interactions in the target region where 1723 were expected .",
    "the other events originated in the spectrometers , the supporting structures , the rock surrounding the cavern , the hall structure .",
    "all electronic detectors were operational and the live time of the data acquisition system exceeded 99% .    for the events classified as cc interations in the target [ fig .",
    "3 ] the muon momentum and the muon angle in the vertical ( y - x ) plane with respect to the horizontal ( z ) axis distributions are compared to the monte carlo ( mc ) expectation .",
    "the beam direction angle is found to be tilted by 58 mrad as expected from the geodesy .",
    "[ fig : distri ]     in the beginning of april 2009 , 1038 bricks have been developed and around 700 events have been located .",
    "the brick finding effiency is @xmath15 and the vertex finding efficiency in the selected bricks for cc events is between 84 - 95 % with 93% predicted by mc and for nc events between 70 - 91 % with 81% expected from mc .    among the located events , 7 events present a charm - like decay topology in agreement with 9.29 events as predicted by the monte carlo simulations .",
    "charm production and decay topology events have a great importance in opera .",
    "indeed , the charm decays exhibit the same topology as @xmath0 decays and they are a potential source of background if the muon at the primary vertex is not identified .",
    "a charm - like topology is shown in figure [ fig .",
    "4 ] where a track presents a decay - kink .",
    "[ fig : charm ]   charged - current interaction with a charm like topology ( top panel ) .",
    "the emulsion reconstruction is shown in the bottom panels where the charm - like topology is seen with a kink : top view ( bottom left ) , side view ( bottom center ) , frontal view ( bottom right ) .",
    "the dots in the lower panel are due to an electromagnetic shower.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "during the 2008 cngs run all the electronic detectors performed well .",
    "the opera strategy has been validated and the vertex location was successfully accomplished for cc and nc events . in the analysed data sample , 7 events with a charm - like topology were found .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation and shows the success of combining the topological and kinematical analyses .",
    "the 2008 run constitute an important milestone for the opera experiment . for the 2009 run , around @xmath16 p.o.t .",
    "are expected .",
    "the integrated statistics would be sufficient to expect the observation of two @xmath0 events and give a precise estimation of detector efficiency , background and sensitivity .",
