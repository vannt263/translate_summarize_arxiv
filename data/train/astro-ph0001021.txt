    "we observed the submillimeter - continuum emission of four low - mass ysos in taurus in 1997 september and december , and 1998 january using scuba on the jcmt , on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "scuba is a bolometer array camera with a long - wavelength array of 37 pixels and a short - wavelength array of 92 pixels .",
    "both arrays can be used simultaneously . in our observations the arrays",
    "were set to 850 and 450 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "@xcite describes the instrument and its observing modes in detail ; this section only gives a short description of our observations and their specific details .",
    "all observations were done as 64-point ` jiggle ' maps , where the secondary mirror is used to produce a nyquist - sampled image of the 450 @xmath0 m array by chopping at a frequency of 7.8125 hz . to cancel sky variations this jiggle pattern",
    "is split into four 16-point sub - patterns of 1 second integration time per point , after which the telescope nods to the negative beam and repeats the pattern .",
    "the complete 64-point pattern takes 128 seconds , with 64 seconds spent looking at the sky on each side of the array .",
    "because of this sky - subtraction , jiggle - maps can only be made of sources which are smaller along the chop direction than the throw distance . in practice",
    "this translates to @xmath27 ; larger chop throws result in poor sky subtraction and degradation of the image quality .",
    "most of our observations were done in service mode and always in stable night - time conditions with an initial @xmath28 chop in azimuth . if the observations spanned several nights , we inspected the first night s results and modified the chop throw or the offset of the array to include as much extended emission as possible .",
    "each observing sequence started with a pointing check on a nearby blazar or secondary calibrator , followed by 510 integrations on the target and another pointing check .",
    "any pointing drifts were corrected for by linear interpolation in azimuth and elevation .",
    "table [ t : obs ] lists the best - fit source positions , observing dates , number of integrations , and chop throw position angle .",
    "most observations were done in excellent or good sub - millimeter conditions , with typical zenith opacities at 850 @xmath0 m of 0.10.3 and seeing of 0205 .",
    "only a few observations were done during marginal sub - millimeter nights , in which case we only used the 850 @xmath0 m data . in 1997",
    "september we used uranus as a primary calibrator , but for our observations in 1997 december and 1998 january we only used the secondary calibrators crl  618 and hl  tau .",
    "the 850 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m optical depth was estimated from the 1.3  mm opacity monitor at the caltech submillimeter observatory , and occasionally double - checked with 850 @xmath0 m sky dips with scuba .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard way using the scuba reduction package surf @xcite .",
    "we took extreme care to inspect the images and blank out any bolometers suspected to have chopped onto source emission .",
    "this could not be avoided for l1535  irs , since the data were taken in only one night and the chop direction could not be corrected later .",
    "the images of l1489  irs are also likely to be affected at their northeast edge , where the emission goes to zero coincident with the chop direction .",
    "the cloud emission also drops off fast in the southwest , but an observation with @xmath29 chop throw as well as previous hco@xmath5 10 and c@xmath4o 21 data suggest that this morphology is real . in all cases ,",
    "the drop off of emission beyond @xmath28 is due to the chop throw ; this only affects the emission near the edges of the images , but not on smaller scales , as confirmed from an observation of l1527  irs with a @xmath30 throw .",
    "after calibration , pointing correction , and sky noise subtraction of each scan , the 850 @xmath0 m images were coadded to determine the best - fit positions of the submillimeter source in each field ( table [ t : obs ] ) .",
    "we then repeated the coadding , now including proper weighting with the noise levels and aligning each scan to the best - fit 850 @xmath0 m position .",
    "we used the 850 @xmath0 m position to align the data from the 450 @xmath0 m array , which is slightly offset from the long - wavelength array . this shift and add procedure ensures that the final images are as sharp as possible .",
    "the scuba positions agree to within @xmath31 of available aperture - synthesis values for l1489  irs and l1527  irs @xcite .",
    "the latter work only marginally detected l1535  irs and tmc  1 , and scuba significantly improves their known positions . for tmc  1",
    "we find offsets of @xmath32 from the position given there , which should be accurate to within @xmath31 .",
    "the observations of l1535  irs suffer from unusually large , systematic pointing drifts , but an offset of @xmath33 is obtained with an uncertainty of @xmath34 in right ascension and @xmath31 in declination estimated from map to map scatter .    the images were further analyzed with the miriad software package @xcite . because of the shape of the jcmt s primary reflector , deviations of its beam from a single gaussian are an important factor in the analysis . at short wavelengths , for example ,",
    "equal power lies within the @xmath35 fwhm main beam as in a much broader error beam .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of observable planets during most of our observations precluded the contemporaneous measurement of the beam profile .",
    "we have used observations of uranus from 1997 september to construct an ad - hoc model of the beam .",
    "fitting the azimuthally averaged uranus data , we find a satisfactory description of the beam profile by three gaussians with relative amplitudes and fwhm as listed in table [ t : beam ] .",
    "the @xmath28 dimension of the largest beam component is partially determined by the size of the chop throw , and thus reflects the beam pattern set by the jcmt dish and the observing mode .",
    "this description of the beam is used in the analysis below .",
    "the 850 and 450 @xmath0 m images show emission peaks at the position of the young stars , surrounded by extended emission filling almost the entire fields of view ( fig .",
    "[ f : maps ] ) .",
    "second emission peaks are visible @xmath36 northeast of l1489  irs and north of l1535  irs .",
    "table [ t : flux ] lists the total flux contained in the images , and results of a gaussian fit to the central emission peaks .",
    "these fits reflect the smallest sized gaussians which can describe the emission peaks , while treating the extended emission as an unrelated background ( see  [ s : central ] ) .",
    "the fluxes and morphologies are consistent with previously published results @xcite .",
    "a blow - up of the @xmath37 around the objects at 450 @xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "[ f : central ] ) show elongated cores oriented roughly perpendicular to the known outflow directions .",
    "the fit results of table [ t : flux ] yield aspects ratios between 3:2 and 2:1 for the central regions of l1489  irs , l1527  irs , and",
    "tmc  1 after deconvolution of the beam size .",
    "the morphology of l1535  irs s emission peak is not well defined and a correspondingly larger size of @xmath38 is found .",
    "its outflow direction is also poorly known .",
    "the position angle of @xmath39 quoted by @xcite was based on scattered 2 @xmath0 m emission interpreted as an outflow cavity , where in fact it is light scattered off the second submillimeter core north of l1535  irs ( see  [ s : coreb ] ) .",
    "the elongated core of l1489  irs and the irregular structure of l1535  irs s emission peak closely resemble aperture - synthesis maps of hco@xmath5 and @xmath3co @xmath40=10 @xcite .    when plotted on a log - log scale in fig .",
    "[ f : azim ] , which better brings out the extended emission , the azimuthally averaged , radial emission profiles of the sources indicate that the extended emission follows a radial power law , corresponding to a straight line in the figure .",
    "for l1527  irs only the radial profile perpendicular to the east - west outflow is shown .",
    "l1489  irs appears much more compact than the other sources , a result which does not depend on the likely artificial drop in emission at the northeast edge of the images (  [ s : obs ] ) .",
    "in addition to emission directly associated with the ysos , l1489  irs and l1535  irs show second emission peaks at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , or @xmath43 au from the ysos .",
    "while l1489  irs s observations were recentered to cover the emission of this second core , the peak adjacent to l1535  irs is located near the edge of the images . since it dominates the emission over the entire field of view , it severely hampers the analysis of the l1535  irs data .",
    "the emission around l1527  irs is elongated along the east - west outflow , perpendicular to the orientation of its central peak .",
    "the outflows of the other sources , which have kinetic luminosities smaller by factors of 3100 @xcite , do not leave a detectable imprint on the dust emission .",
    "the quality of the scuba observations is sufficient to derive the spectral index @xmath44 between 850 and 450 @xmath0 m ( figs .",
    "[ f : maps ] and [ f : azim ] ) . to obtain images of @xmath44 , we deconvolved the 850 and 450 @xmath0 m images with the appropriate beam profiles , convolved them with a single gaussian to the same resolution of 145 , and calculated @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath44 range between 1.8 and 3.5 .",
    "the largest values are found toward the position of l1489  irs and along the outflow cavity of l1527  irs ; the lowest values around tmc  1 .",
    "a proper description of the beam profile is crucial when deriving the spectral index : using a single gaussian for the beam lowers @xmath44 by 0.5 on average and significantly changes its spatial distribution .    in the submillimeter range ,",
    "the overall spectral index @xmath44 reflects the emission - averaged values of the dust temperature , the opacity , and the spectral index of the dust emissivity @xmath46 .",
    "assuming fully optically thin emission and @xmath471.52.0 ( as expected for dust in dense clouds , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the observed @xmath44 directly translates to dust temperatures of 1015 k for the extended material and @xmath8 k for the material near l1489  irs and along the outflow of l1527  irs ; lower values of @xmath46 , corresponding to grain growth @xcite , give higher temperatures .",
    "at the position of l1527  irs , the spectral index shows a local minimum of @xmath48 .",
    "the next section will show that rather than a lower temperature , a decreased @xmath46 in the central region or a significant contribution from optically thick emission from an unresolved circumstellar disk are more likely explanations .",
    "the extended emission peaks northeast of l1489  irs and north of l1535  irs do not show up as extrema in @xmath44 , indicating that they correspond to enhancements in column density rather than temperature . in the following",
    ", we will refer to these condensations as l1489  ne - smm and l1535  n - smm .",
    "the emission profiles of fig . [ f : azim ] show that the emission of the extended emission follows a radial power law .",
    "the inside - out collapse model predicts a power - law distribution for the density with negative index between 1 and 2 , where the exact shape is given by the location of the collapse expansion wave @xmath17 . in this section",
    "we investigate which single value of the power - law index @xmath49 best fits the overall emission around the sources ; the next section will focus on the inside - out collapse model .",
    "since these model results are mostly constrained by the extended emission , no additional unresolved sources like circumstellar disks are included ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of the effect of the presence of an unresolved central source on derived model parameters ) .",
    "these models are spherically symmetric ; at the end of this section (  [ s : central ] ) we will look at the properties of the central elongated emission peaks , and how they differ from those inferred for the envelope as a whole .    for the power - law model",
    "we adopt a density distribution @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the density at an arbitrary radius of 1000 au . instead of density @xmath52",
    "we will use the h@xmath53 number density @xmath54 as a parameter , assuming a ` standard ' gas - to - dust ratio of 100:1 .",
    "the inner radius of the envelope is set at 50 au , which does not influence the results , while the outer radius is initially set at 8000 au .",
    "following @xcite , we assume the dust temperature to follow a radial power law with index 0.4 , @xmath55 k. such a distribution is expected for a spherical cloud with an embedded heating source and which is optically thin to the bulk of the heating radiation .",
    "the dust temperature depends on the luminosity of the central source as described by @xcite . for our sources , @xmath56 k ( l1489  irs : 3.7 @xmath25 ) and 24 k ( l1535  irs and tmc  1 : 0.7 @xmath25 ) .",
    "these temperature distributions reproduce the observed seds at millimeter and infrared wavelengths for the envelope parameters derived below ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for l1527  irs ,",
    "the above expression yields @xmath57 k , which significantly overestimates the iras fluxes at 100 and 60 @xmath0 m . for the parameters derived below",
    ", the opacity of its envelope is around unity at these wavelengths , and it is possible that a flattened rather than spherical geometry of its edge - on envelope could increase the opacity by a factor of a few and hence reconcile the fluxes .",
    "however , for our modeling we choose to lower the temperature of l1527  irs s envelope to @xmath58 k , in which case the 100 and 60 @xmath0 m are reproduced .",
    "the power - law index of @xmath59 of our adopted temperature profile ( @xmath60 ) is strictly true only for @xmath61 .",
    "@xcite give an alternative description of @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",
    "for realistic values of @xmath46 of 12 , this translates to @xmath640.4 .",
    "heating by the external radiation field may be an other factor influencing the temperature profile ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the rayleigh - jeans limit of the planck function is not valid in the submillimeter range , the emission  and the inferred model parameters ",
    "depend sensitively on the temperature distribution .",
    "provided that the choice for the adopted temperature distribution is reasonable , the conclusions that a certain model does or does not fit the data is more robust that the exact value of the inferred model parameters . since it is the main aim of this paper to investigate models for yso envelopes , rather than derive accurate constraints on their parameters , we deem our simple description of the temperature distribution sufficient , but urge the reader to keep in mind that the values of the inferred parameters are valid only within the framework of our model assumptions .",
    "realistic models for the dust emissivity at submillimeter wavelengths , including grain growth , are available @xcite , but for the sake of simplicity we parameterize the dust emissivity as @xmath65 , with @xmath66 hz and @xmath67 @xmath68  g@xmath69 ( gas and dust , with a gas : dust ratio of 100:1 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "typical values for @xmath46 range between 1 and 2 , although much lower values of @xmath70 have been found in t  tauri disks @xcite .",
    "the absolute values for @xmath71 lie within a factor of 23 from those of the more elaborate models , a difference which only influences the inferred mass , not the density power law index .",
    "the free parameters of this model are the density at 1000 au @xmath72 , the density power - law index @xmath49 , and the dust spectral index @xmath46 .",
    "these correspond to the observed total flux , radial emission profile , and ratio of 450 to 850 micron emission , respectively . for each combination of @xmath73",
    "we calculate the emission from the envelope model over the imaged region by following the radiative transfer along a large number of lines of sight through the source using the planck function .",
    "the resulting intensity distribution is then convolved with the appropriate beam pattern , and a @xmath74 measure is determined of the difference between the model and the data at both wavelength bands together over a @xmath75 ( @xmath76 au ) region around the source .",
    "minimization of the @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the intensity in jy  beam@xmath69 , @xmath79 the noise , and the summation is over all pixels within the @xmath75 region and both wavelength bands , yields best - fit values of @xmath72 , @xmath49 , and @xmath46 listed in table [ t : powfit ] .",
    "the indicated uncertainties in the best - fit values include the effects of signal - to - noise , the shape of the @xmath74 surface , and an estimated 20% calibration uncertainty in the 850 and 450 @xmath0 m data .",
    "the reduced @xmath74 values of these fits are 1.5 for l1489  irs , 0.8 for l1535  irs , 2.7 for l1527  irs , and 0.7 for tmc  1 .",
    "the model fit requires assumptions about the contribution of l1489  ne - smm and l1535  n - smm to the emission ; the emission along l1527  irs s outflow does not contribute significantly within the fitting region .",
    "we assume a gaussian emission distribution centered on the former cores with adjustable flux at 850 @xmath0 m , spectral index , and major and minor axes .",
    "this increases the number of free parameters from three to seven .",
    "because the @xmath74 measure is still limited to @xmath80 around the ysos , the best - fit values for the latter four parameters are not representative for the l1489  ne - smm and l1535  n - smm cores as a whole but only describe the ` background ' emission around the source due to the secondary cores ( see  [ s : coreb ] ) .",
    "the observations are well fit by the power - law model ( fig .",

    "our inferred value of @xmath84 is marginally consistent with the result of sed fitting by @xcite of @xmath85 .",
    "the difference is possibly due to the much smaller outer radius of 2500 au adopted by these authors corresponding to their smaller imaged regions .",
    "the inferred values for the spectral index @xmath46 of the dust emissivity are 1.52.0 , excluding the uncertain values for l1535  irs , as expected for material in dense molecular clouds which underwent some grain growth ( @xmath86 , * ? ? ?",

    "the adopted local turbulent line width of 0.2 km  s@xmath69 , independent of radius , is similar to that found in dark cloud cores @xcite ; since the systematic ( infall ) motions of the model dominate the overall velocity field , the calculated profiles are independent to changes in the turbulent width of factors of a few .",
    "after the level populations have converged , the sky brightness distribution is calculated and convolved with the appropriate beams .    with these parameters ,",

    ", the line profiles predicted by the model calculations do not agree at all with the observations , showing much larger widths ( 1015 km  s@xmath69 vs. @xmath107 km  s@xmath69 ) .",
    "apparently , its compact size and steep density fall - off are not well described by the inside - out collapse model ( see  [ s : l1489 ] ) .    to answer the question posed at the beginning of this section : yes",
    ", the inside - out collapse model can reproduce the observed line profiles . and",
    "where it fails , it confirms earlier suspicions that the inside - out collapse model is not a good description for l1489  irs .",
    "section [ s : shumdl ] showed that the inside - out collapse model can successfully describe the density and the velocity structure of the extended envelopes around our ysos . perhaps the most direct indication that the line and continuum data are tracing the same collapse model ,",
    "is given by the hco@xmath5 line widths toward l1527  irs and tmc  1 .",
    "the continuum data suggest a factor of two difference in sound speed , which is , as the inside - out model predicts , reflected in the factor of two difference in line widths seen toward the sources ( fig .",
    "[ f : spec ] ; note the different respective horizontal scales ) .",
    "our modeling clearly illustrates that a full test of a collapse model requires independent measurements of the density and the velocity structure .",
    "we have used submillimeter continuum and line observations to obtain this goal .",
    "a judicially chosen set of molecules and lines will work as well , if some of these lines are readily thermalized and their excitation no longer depend on the density .    combining continuum and line data , as well as combining lines from different molecules , introduces some level of uncertainty , however . in our case",
    ", it arises from uncertainties in the dust emissivity , the co depletion , and possibly the gas - to - dust ratio . for a molecular line set it",
    "is reflected in the abundances of the different species . in general",
    ", it comes down to the question of how the fluxes in different tracers are scaled to one another .",
    "hence , it is easier to test whether a certain collapse model can fit the data than to accurately constrain its parameters . in  [ s : shumdl ] we confirmed that the envelopes of l1527  irs and tmc  1 are well described by the infall model , but the derived values for the sound speed and the age are valid only for the adopted values for the dust emissivity and the dust temperature distribution .",
    "for example , different values are quoted in  [ s : molmdl ] derived from directly fitting line profiles , a process which comes with its own set of model assumptions ( kinetic temperature , abundance , etc . ) .",
    "clearly , this situation can be much improved if the temperature distribution of the dust and of the gas is constrained by observations .",
    "self - consistent modeling of the continuum radiative transfer and the heating and cooling balance of the dust and the gas will be an important step , as will be observations of spatially resolved seds ( e.g. , from sofia ) and sensitive tracers of the gas kinetic temperature ( e.g. , h@xmath53co , @xcite ) . with these tools",
    ", we can hope to go beyond the simple inside - out collapse model of @xcite and investigate more realistic , but more complex , collapse models .      for l1489",
    "irs the inside - out model spectacularly fails to simultaneously fit the continuum and line data , although both data sets can be fit separately ( see  [ s : shumdl ] and @xcite ) .",
    "together with other pieces of evidence , this leads us to suggest that l1489  irs is not embedded in a collapsing envelope , but is instead surrounded by a 2000 au radius , rotating , thick disk - like structure .",
    "first , fig .",
    "[ f : azim ] indicates a much more compact size of @xmath108 au in radius compared to the other sources .",
    "second , interferometric observations of hco@xmath5 and @xmath3co 10 directly reveal a rotating structure of this size , coincident in orientation with the position angle of table [ t : flux ] @xcite .",
    "third , its comparatively bright near - infrared sed appears intermediate between that of embedded objects and t  tauri stars @xcite . in such a disk - like structure ,",
    "one still expects power - law distributions for the density and the velocity ( keplerian rotation ) , but a different distribution of mass with velocity .",
    "therefore , the power - laws of the inside - out collapse model can still fit the density and the velocity individually but not simultaneously .",
    "our data do not constrain the vertical structure of this disk - like structure , since it is almost unresolved along its minor axis .",
    "could l1489  irs be a transitional object between the fully embedded class  i and the optically revealed t  tauri phases , with its extended envelope collapsed into a 2000 au radius disk - like structure ?",
    "its inclination has been constrained to near edge - on ( @xmath109@xmath110 ; @xcite ) , and a thick disk - like structure may explain its bright near - infrared but visually obscured nature ( see also * ? ? ? * for hst / nicmos observations of this same structure ) .",
    "this situation is reminiscent in some ways of t  tau , where a class  ii star ( t  tau  n ) also has many of the characteristics of a class  i object because of the large amount of circumstellar material  in fact , t  tau consists of a class  ii object t  tau  n and a more embedded , class  i companion , t  tau  s @xcite . that t  tau  n is classified as an optically visible class  ii object may be largely due to its favorable face - on orientation with respect to the observer @xcite , possibly exactly opposite from the class  i classification of the more edge - on l1489  irs .",
    "other objects which come to mind in this context are hl  tau ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which also has a steep density distribution in its envelope @xcite .",
    "an important difference with t  tau , and with many younger class  i objects , is that no ( 100 au radius ) centrifugal disk of significant mass appears to surround l1489  irs .",
    "it is only marginally detected in 3  mm aperture - synthesis observations which selectively trace such disks ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it seems unlikely that l1489  irs is a low - mass system , and hence may have an intrinsically low - mass disk , because of its comparatively large luminosity of 3.7 @xmath25 . possibly , l1489",
    "irs is a close binary , inhibiting the formation of a circumstellar accretion disk @xcite . @xcite only detect a single point source , but with 015 resolution , binaries with separations less than 20  au are still unresolved .",
    "one possibility is that we observe l1489  irs at the moment where it is making its transition from an embedded object to a t  tauri star , as appears to be the case for hl  tau . rotating disks around t  tauri stars have typical radii of 5001000 au radius in line emission @xcite , but appear more compact ( @xmath111 au ) when observed in continuum due to differences in line and continuum emissivities .",
    "no sensitive scuba images of the dust continuum around such t  tauri stars have been published , however , which may show more extended low - level structures , and which offer a better comparison to the observations of l1489  irs . at a contraction velocity of only 0.5 km  s@xmath69 , it will take l1489  irs s disk - like structure @xmath112 yr to contract to 500 au .",
    "this is short compared to the @xmath113 yr typically required to disperse the envelope , and only a detailed analysis of its velocity structure will allow its detection in the presence of the much larger ( 23 km  s@xmath69 ) rotation velocities .",
    "another possibility which such an analysis might confirm , is that l1489  irs s disk - like structure is not contracting but is fully rotationally supported . if its central object is indeed a close binary which has inhibited the formation of an accretion disk , this system may find itself without an efficient means to carry away excess angular momentum .",
    "bipolar outflows driven by disk accretion are generally thought to play an important role in this process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "l1489  irs s outflow as detected in co 32 is very weak indeed @xcite .",
    "a binary companion may have cleared a gap in the accretion disk , shutting off or greatly decreasing the inward flow of material .",
    "ascertaining whether l1489  irs is , as this would suggest , a young analog to the gg  tau ` ring ' system @xcite will require additional observations in the near- and mid - infrared characterizing this object s multiplicity and accretion state , as well as aperture - synthesis in molecular lines to probe the velocities in the disk - like structure .",
    "section [ s : models ] only considered models which describe the emission over the entire envelope in a spherically symmetric geometry , and neglected any radial changes in dust properties or source geometry .",
    "this section adopts a different view of the data , fitting two gaussians to the data , one describing the emission from the central region and one from the extended emission . by minimizing the size of the first component",
    ", we maximize the difference between the emission from the central region and the extended emission , and thus the difference with the models explored in the previous two sections .",
    "this description of the intensity distribution only refers to the central @xmath114 around the objects . since the emission follows a radial power law (  [ s : models ] , a series of gaussians",
    "would be required to fit the entire images . by limiting ourselves to the inner @xmath115 ,",
    "two gaussians suffice .",
    "we do not claim that these gaussian carry physical significance beyond being a description of the emission profiles and allowing for an investigation of the dust properties on small scales .",
    "table [ t : flux ] lists the ( deconvolved ) major and minor axes and position angles of the central gaussian components ; the listed components fit the radial emission profiles in the inner @xmath115 as well as the single power laws of  [ s : powmdl ] .",
    "we consider a simple isothermal model for the central regions , with an effective temperature estimated from the infrared sed .",
    "warm material near the star dominates the emission at 100 @xmath0 m and shorter , yielding a characteristic temperature for the inner regions of the envelope .",
    "this is essentially an effective temperature : it describes the characteristics of the emission , not the physical temperature of the bulk of the material .",
    "using an effective temperature , allows us to link the observed intensity in both wavelength bands through a spectral index of the dust emissivity .",
    "the free parameters of this model are the effective temperature , the source diameter , and the spectral index of the dust emissivity , again parameterized as @xmath116 @xmath68  g@xmath69 ( gas+dust , with gas : dust=100 ) .",
    "we assume that the emission is optically thin ( but see below ) .    the 850 and 450 @xmath0 m fluxes and sizes of the central peaks and the infrared sed from @xcite yields best - fit results as listed in table [ t : central ] .",
    "the obtained diameters are @xmath117 or 1000 au , slightly larger than the typical value for disks around t  tauri stars as seen in molecular lines @xcite .",
    "the spectral index of the dust emissivity @xmath46 is 0.91.1 , with an estimated uncertainty of 0.2 .",
    "toward l1527  irs the low @xmath46 is directly reflected in the spectral index maps of fig .",
    "[ f : maps ] ; toward the other sources increased temperature partially compensates for the lower @xmath46 .",
    "these values of the dust emissivity s spectral index are significantly smaller than the 1.51.9 representative of the entire envelope ( tables [ t : powfit ] and [ t : shufit ] ) , and indicate that grain growth may take place on small scales .",
    "alternatively , the low spectral index indicates a significant contribution to the emission from optically thick material .",
    "the envelope models as derived in the previous sections are optically thin at 850 and 450 @xmath0 m , even at small radii , and significant flattening is required to increase the opacity without changing the flux .",
    "part of the central flux could also originate in an unresolved , optically thick circumstellar disk .",
    "previous 3  mm interferometer observations @xcite and limits inferred by @xcite suggest , however , that no more than 1020% of the flux at 850 and 450 @xmath0 m can be attributed to an unresolved point source . we therefore conclude that the observed decrease in spectral index on small scales is likely caused by a change in dust properties , but can not rule out a significant contribution from optically thick material if the inner regions of the envelope are highly flattened .",
    "the presence of l1489  ne - smm and l1535  n - smm within 10,000 au of the ysos l1489  irs and l1535  irs , respectively , shows that star formation in truly isolated cores is rare even in taurus .",
    "these cores are not chance alignments but are physically close to the ysos . moderately dense ( @xmath113 @xmath118 ) gas traced by hco@xmath5",
    "10 shows emission from these cores near the systemic velocities of the ysos @xcite , and l1535  n - smm is visible in scattered near - infrared emission in observations by @xcite .",
    "their presence was already noted by @xcite , who show that they coincide with nh@xmath119 cores detected by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the nature of these cores is best investigated through the residual images after subtracting the yso models ( fig .",
    "[ f : shures ] ) . because the power - law model and the inside - out collapse model provide equally well fits to the continuum data , only the residuals of the latter are shown .",
    "figure [ f:2azim ] presents the radial flux density profiles around the centers of these cores .",
    "contrary to the emission distribution of the ysos , those of l1489  ne - smm and l1535  n - smm are not characterized by a power - law , but more closely resemble a gaussian of deconvolved fwhm @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "it seems unlikely that this shape is caused by the assumption of a gaussian distribution in the model fits , since these only applied to the @xmath75 immediately around the ysos .",
    "the spectral index of the emission from these cores is not significantly changed by the subtraction of the best fit yso models , and indicates a dust temperature of 1015 k , assuming a dust emissivity spectral index of @xmath1222 . for such low temperatures , masses of 0.53.0 @xmath10",
    "are found for both cores , significantly larger than the circumstellar masses of l1535  irs and l1489  irs , and close to the virial mass estimates assuming a velocity dispersion of 0.20.3 km  s@xmath69 and a density distribution given by @xmath123 .",
    "the low temperature throughout the cores , their large masses , and the lack of central concentration all suggest that these cores do not contain embedded sources .",
    "further interferometric searches for embedded continuum sources and molecular line observations of possible infall signatures will shed more light on the nature of these cores .",
    "contrary to l1489  irs and l1535  irs , the fields of l1527  irs and tmc  1 are dominated by the yso s themselves .",
    "we interpret the residual emission toward l1527  irs as dust heated to @xmath8 k along the edge of the outflow .",
    "an upper limit to the mass of 0.2 @xmath10 is found , or 10% of the total inferred envelope mass .",
    "this is comparable to the total amount of swept up co ( 0.2 @xmath10 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and may be the same material .",
    "no residual emission is detected toward tmc  1 , making it an ideal target for further studies of isolated star formation .",
    "this paper presents high - quality submillimeter - continuum observations of four embedded ysos in taurus , analyzes them in terms of the popular collapse model of @xcite , and compares the results to molecular - line data .",
    "the main conclusions can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "the emission around the ysos can be described by @xmath124 au elongated central peaks , oriented perpendicular to the outflows , embedded in extended emission filling the fields of view .",
    "the density distribution in the extended envelopes is characterized by a radial power - law the with negative index @xmath212 , and outer radii between 2000 au and 12,000 au .",
    "the inferred envelope masses are 0.0163.5 @xmath10 .",
    "equally good fits can be found using the inside - out collapse model of @xcite , yielding sound speeds @xmath1250.46 km  s@xmath69 and ages between @xmath90 and @xmath95 yr .",
    "3 .   only independent measurements of the density and",
    "the velocity structure can offer true tests of collapse models . combined with",
    "previously obtained molecular line data , the scuba observations provide such a test .",
    "the combination of both data sets confirms that l1527  irs , tmc  1 , and probably l1535  irs , are surrounded by collapsing envelopes which can be described by the inside - out collapse model .",
    "4 .   for one source , l1489  irs , the inside - out collapse model spectacularly fails to fit the continuum and line data simultaneously . instead , a better solution is offered by a rotating , disk - like structure of 2000 au radius with a density distribution following a radial power - law .",
    "we suggest that this source may be in a transitional phase between a class  i and class  ii object , and is possibly stunted in its evolution because of insufficient means to carry away excess angular momentum .",
    "grain growth on small scales is evidenced by the decrease of the spectral index of the dust emissivity from 1.52.0 in the extended envelopes to @xmath7 in the central elongated cores , although high optical depth in the inner regions of the envelopes is also a possible explanation .",
    "star formation in isolated cores is rare , even in taurus , as is witnessed by the presence of two , apparently starless , cores within 10,000 au of our ysos .",
    "these cores are cold ( 1015 k ) , lack central concentration in their density structure , but have sufficient mass to eventually form stars ( 0.53.0 @xmath10 ) .",

    "<S> this inside - out collapse model predicts @xmath3co , c@xmath4o , hco@xmath5 , and h@xmath3co@xmath5 line profiles which closely match observed spectra toward three of our four sources . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the inside - out collapse model offers a good description of yso envelopes , but also that reliable constraints on its parameters require independent measurements of the density and the velocity structure , e.g. , through continuum and line observations . for the remaining source , l1489  irs </S>",
    "<S> , we find that a model consisting of a 2000 au radius , rotating , disk - like structure better describes the data . </S>",
    "<S> possibly , this source is in transition between the embedded class  i and the optically revealed t  tauri phases . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral index of the dust emissivity decreases from @xmath62.0 in the extended envelope to @xmath7 in the central peaks , indicating grain growth or high optical depth on small scales . </S>",
    "<S> the observations of l1527  irs reveal warm ( @xmath8 k ) material outlining , and presumably heated by , its bipolar outflow . </S>",
    "<S> this material comprises @xmath9 @xmath10 , comparable to the amount of swept - up co but only 10% of the total envelope mass . </S>",
    "<S> two apparently starless cores are found at @xmath11 au from l1489  irs and l1535  irs . </S>",
    "<S> they are cold , 1015 k , contain 0.53.0 @xmath10 , and have flat density distributions characterized by a gaussian of @xmath11 au fwhm . </S>",
    "<S> the proximity of these cores shows that star formation in truly isolated cores is rare even in taurus . </S>"
