    "@xcite this family offers possibilities for substitutions on all three crystallographic sites that can result in a complex combination of steric and carrier - doping effects while maitaining simplicity of the crystal structure .",
    "however , the main body of the published work on the 122 family has focused on the _ ae_(fe@xmath2_tm_@xmath3)@xmath4as@xmath4 series , in which the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and sometimes @xmath10 transition metals substitute for fe .",
    "this is due to the reasonable ease of growing large , high quality , homogeneous single crystals .",
    "despite the fact that in the 122 system , superconductivity , with a @xmath11 k , was first reported on k - doping of bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 @xcite and this value of @xmath1 is still holding a record for bulk superconductivity in the _ ae_fe@xmath4as@xmath4 - related materials , detailed studies of the complete ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 solid solution series are not so common , @xcite and concentrate mainly on the evolution of the crystallographic properties and the @xmath12 phase diagram .",
    "one of the reasons for this is a persistent difficulty in determination of the reliable procedure for synthesis of homogeneous ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 single crystals in a wide range of k - concentration .    in the hole - doped",

    "the first set is comprised of the initial ( @xmath21 kbar ) pressure dependencies of the superconducting transition temperatures , @xmath22 and is alike the data reported for ba(fe@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath4as@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite such data have the potential to assess the possibility of equivalence of pressure and doping that was suggested for several 122 series .",
    "@xcite moreover , under favorable circumstances such dataset can shed light on the details of superconductivity mechanism in the particular series .",
    "@xcite the second set consists of the data on the evolution of the jump in heat capacity at the superconducting transition .",
    "many fe - based , 122 superconductors follow the trend suggested in ref . and expanded in ref .",
    ", the so - called bnc scaling , @xmath23 .",
    "the underdoped and optimally doped ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 appear to follow this trend as well , @xcite whereas the stoichiometric end - compound , kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 , clearly deviates from the trend .",
    "@xcite detailed study of the @xmath6 in the whole range of k concentrations might clarify the evolution of superconducting properties in the series .",
    "homogeneous , single phase , ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 polycrystalline powders with @xmath24 = 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.9 and 1.0 were synthesized by a procedure similar to that reported earlier.@xcite the starting reagents , kas , baas , and fe@xmath4as were prepared by heating elemental mixtures at @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , respectively . for each composition",
    "a stoichiometric mixture of these binary compounds was thoroughly ground to a uniform and homogeneous powder , loaded in an alumina crucible subsequently enclosed in a niobium tube and then sealed in a quartz tube , and pre - heated at @xmath28 for 12 h. this sintered mixture was then re - ground and pressed into a pellet which was again loaded in a niobium tube and sealed in a quartz tube .",
    "the pellet was heated to @xmath29 , depending on the composition , for 24 to 48 h followed by quenching to room temperature in air .",
    "the homogeneity of ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 polycrystalline powder was ensured by repeating this process multiple times .",
    "the structure and quality of the final crystalline powders of ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 were confirmed by x - ray powder diffraction and magnetization measurements and the @xmath24 values of all products were estimated by comparing the superconducting @xmath1 s observed with those precisely determined in the phase diagram reported previously .",
    "@xcite for the end - member sample with @xmath30 , the single phase product was prepared by a flux reaction of fe / kas at 1:6 ratio at @xmath31 for 6 h. the pure crystals of kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 were then isolated by dissolving the excess kas flux in alcohol under a nitrogen atmosphere .    the synthesis of ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 has been known to be delicate mainly because of high vapor pressures of k / as and an unfavorable kinetics toward the composition of optimally doped state @xmath32 that exhibits the highest @xmath1 in the ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series . particularly for the underdoped region between @xmath33 and @xmath34 where the superconductivity of ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 emerges",
    ", it is very difficult to obtain highly homogeneous samples with a sharp single transition because of a very sensitive change in @xmath1 by a small variation in composition in this region ( see the phase diagram in ref . or in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] below ) .",
    "therefore , in this synthetic procedure a closed metal tube , with minimal volume , is necessary to suppress vaporization of k / as at high temperatures . also for better control of k / ba ratio during the reaction , the annealing temperature was gradually increased from @xmath35 for @xmath36 to @xmath37 for @xmath38 . about 10 - 20% of additional kas in the reaction mixture after the pre - reaction is needed to compensate the loss of k / as that occurs by the extended period of annealing at high temperature for all compositions .",
    "handling of all materials was carried out under a dry argon atmosphere .",
    "low - field dc magnetization under pressure , was measured in a quantum design magnetic property measurement system , mpms-5 , squid magnetometer using a a commercial , hmd , be - cu piston - cylinder pressure cell . @xcite daphne oil 7373 was used as a pressure medium and superconducting pb or sn ( to have its superconducting transition well separated from that of the sample ) as a low - temperature pressure gauge .",
    "the heat capacity was measured using a hybrid adiabatic relaxation technique of the heat capacity option in a quantum design physical property measurement system , ppms-9 or ppms-14 , instrument .",
    "an example of @xmath39 data taken at different pressures is shown in fig .",
    "an onset criterion was used to determine @xmath1 .",
    "since none of the samples was suffering from a distinct change of the transition width under pressure , alternative criteria ( like maximum in @xmath40 ) yield similar pressure dependencies .",
    "the pressure dependencies of the superconducting transition temperatures for the samples with all k - concentrations studied in this work are shown in fig . [ f2 ] . for the underdoped sample , with @xmath38 ,",
    "@xmath1 increases under pressure , for samples close to the optimally doped , @xmath41 , the @xmath22 dependencies are basically flat , and for the overdoped samples , @xmath42 , @xmath1 decreases under pressure . for all samples , except the underdoped @xmath38",
    "the @xmath22 behavior is linear , as such the pressure dependencies of @xmath1 can be well represented by @xmath43 values .",
    "the set of @xmath22 data yields the ambient pressure @xmath44 values defined as extrapolation to @xmath45 data under pressure .",
    "these values are consistent with the superconducting transition temperatures obtained from the analysis of the ambient pressure specific heat data below , shown as stars in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] .    a more compact way to look at the pressure dependence of @xmath1 in the ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , where the results of this work are plotted together with the literature data @xcite that show consistency between different groups / samples in the overlapping concentration regions .",
    "the @xmath44 data are consistent with the ambient pressure data in the literature @xcite and are shown for reference . the k - concentration dependent pressure derivatives , @xmath46 , and normalized , @xmath47 show a clear trend and three different k - concentrations regions .",
    "the pressure derivatives are positive and rather high for the significantly underdoped samples ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 k ) .",
    "they become small and negative for @xmath50 , this concentration range covers slightly underdoped , optimally doped , and part of the overdoped samples ; the concentration dependence of @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 ) is close to linear in this middle region . on further increase of @xmath24",
    "the @xmath24-dependence of the pressure derivatives deviated from the shallow linear behavior ( this trend is better seen in the concentration dependence of the normalized pressure derivatives ) .",
    "[ f4 ] presents a comparison of the relative changes in superconducting transition temperature under pressure and with k - doping . for @xmath51",
    "both sets of data can be scaled reasonably well , illustrating apparent equivalence of the effect of pressure and doping on @xmath1 , suggested for other members of the 122 family .",
    "@xcite this scaling however fails for @xmath52 .",
    "all samples studied in this work except for @xmath38 show unambiguous jump in specific heat at @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ f5 ] as an example ) .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath6 values were determined by a procedure consistent with that used in ref . .",
    "for @xmath38 the difference between the data taken in zero field and 140 koe applied field was analyzed and the error bars in the obtained @xmath53 at @xmath1 value are expected to be rather large .",
    "the specific heat jump data for the ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series obtained in this work were added in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] to the updated bnc plot taken from ref . .",
    "again , there appears to be a clear trend : for @xmath51 the data follow the bnc scaling , in agreement with the scattered literature data for the samples with k - concentrations in this range .",
    "the data for @xmath54 clearly deviate from this scaling , with the data for the end - compound , kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 , consistent with the previously published value .",
    "@xcite this is clearly different from the studied ba(fe@xmath2_tm_@xmath3)@xmath4as@xmath4 series , for which the bnc scaling was observed for the samples covering the full extent of the superconducting dome .",
    "both sets of measurements point out that some change in superconducting properties of ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 occurs near the @xmath55 concentration range .",
    "nmr results @xcite suggested that the nodal line structure of the superconducting gap emerges at @xmath5 without a change of the gap symmetry , although the possibility of the change of the superconducting gap symmetry at this concentration was not completely excluded .",
    "these suggested changes were related to a lifshitz transition , a disappearance of the electron pockets in the fermi surface , at similar k - doping levels .",
    "@xcite the anomaly in the evolution of the pressure derivatives with concentration is consistent with what one would expect in the case of the lifshitz transition , @xcite along the same lines as evolution of @xmath43 was understood in several cuprates .",
    "@xcite the observed violation of the bnc scaling hints that some significant changes might happen in the nature of the superconducting state as well .",
    "these results delineate the difference between transition metal doping and k - doping in the bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 series concentration and define the k - concentration region where the superconducting state ( possibly the order parameter ) is significantly modified .",
    "further measurements for concentrations around 70% of k ( in particular arpes and thermal conductivity ) would be desirable to understand the observed anomalies .",
