    "in this paper we give a simplified version of our proof of the following theorem :    * the weak factorization theorem*[th:1 ]    1 .",
    "lef @xmath0 be a birational map of smooth complete varieties over a field of characteristic zero , which is an isomorphism over an open set @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath2 can be factored as @xmath3 where each @xmath4 is a smooth complete variety and @xmath5 is a blow - up or blow - down at a smooth center which is an isomorphism over @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are divisors with simple normal crossings , then each @xmath8 is a divisor with simple normal crossings and @xmath5 is a blow - up or blow - down at a smooth center which has normal crossings with components of @xmath9 .",
    "3 .   there is an index @xmath10 such that for all @xmath11 the induced birational map @xmath12 is a projective morphism and for all @xmath13 the map @xmath14 is projective morphism .",
    "the above factorization is functorial in the following sense : + let @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 be automorphisms of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 such that @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the natural morphisms .",
    "then the induced birational transformations @xmath25 are automorphisms of @xmath4 commuting with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "moreover if @xmath28 and @xmath29 then for all @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 .",
    "the factorization commute with field extensions @xmath32 .",
    "the theorem was proven in @xcite and in @xcite in a more general version .",
    "the above formulation essentially reflects the statement of the theorem in @xcite .",
    "the weak factorization theorem extends a theorem of zariski , which states that any birational map between two smooth complete surfaces can be factored into a succession of blow - ups at points followed by a succession of blow - downs at points .",
    "a stronger version of the above theorem , called the strong factorization conjecture , remains open .    *",
    "strong factorization conjecture*. any birational map @xmath0 of smooth complete varieties can be factored into a succession of blow - ups at smooth centers followed by a succession of blow - downs at smooth centers .",
    "note that both statements are equivalent in dimension 2 .",
    "one can find the formulation of the relevant conjectures in many papers .",
    "hironaka @xcite formulated the strong factorization conjecture .",
    "the weak factorization problem was stated by miyake and oda @xcite .",
    "the toric versions of the strong and weak factorizations were also conjectured by miyake and oda @xcite and are called the strong and weak oda conjectures .",
    "the @xmath33-dimensional toric version of the weak form was established by danilov @xcite ( see also ewald @xcite ) .",
    "the weak toric conjecture in arbitrary dimensions was proved in @xcite and later independently by morelli @xcite , who also claimed to have a proof of the strong factorization conjecture ( see also morelli @xcite ) .",
    "morelli s proof of the weak oda conjecture was completed , revised and generalized to the toroidal case by abramovich , matsuki and rashid in @xcite .",
    "a gap in morelli s proof of the strong oda conjecture , which went unnnoticed in @xcite , was later found by k. karu .    the local version of the strong factorization problem was posed by abhyankar in dimension 2 and by christensen in general ; christensen has solved it for 3-dimensional toric varieties @xcite .",
    "the local version of the weak factorization problem ( in characteristic 0 ) was solved by cutkosky @xcite , who also showed that oda s strong conjecture implies the local version of the strong conjecture for proper birational morphisms @xcite and proved the local strong factorization conjecture in dimension 3 @xcite via christensen s theorem .",
    "finally karu generalized christensen s result to any dimension and completed the argument for the local strong factorization @xcite .    the proofs in @xcite and @xcite are both build upon the idea of cobordisms which was developed in @xcite and was inspired by morelli s theory of polyhedral cobordisms @xcite .",
    "the main idea of @xcite is to construct a space with a @xmath34-action for a given birational map .",
    "the space called a birational cobordism resembles the idea of morse cobordism and determines a decomposition of the birational map into elementary transformations ( see remark [ cobordism ] ) .",
    "this gives a factorization into a sequence of weighted blow - ups and blow - downs .",
    "one can view the factorization determined by the cobordisms also in terms of vgit developed in papers of thaddeuss and dolgachev - hu . as shown in @xcite the weighted blow - ups which occur in the factorization have a natural local toric description which is crucial for their further regularization .",
    "the two existing methods of regularizing centers of this factorization are @xmath35-desingularization of cobordisms as in @xcite and local torification of the action as in @xcite .",
    "the present proof is essentially the same as in @xcite . instead of working in full generality and developing the suitable language for toroidal varieties we focus on applying the general ideas to a particular construction of a smooth cobordism .",
    "the @xmath35-desingularization is a desingularization of geometric quotients of a @xmath34-action .",
    "this can be done locally and the procedure can be globalized in the functorial and even canonical way .",
    "the @xmath35-desingularization makes all the intermediate varieties ( which are geometric quotients ) smooth , and also the connecting blow - ups have smooth centers .",
    "the proof of abramovich , karu , matsuki and the author @xcite relies on a subtle analysis of differences between locally toric and toroidal structures defined by the action of @xmath34 .",
    "the abramovich - de jong idea of torification is roughly speaking to construct the ideal sheaves whose blow - ups ( or principalizations ) introduce the structure of toroidal varieties in neighborhoods of fixed points of the action .",
    "this allows one to pass from birational maps between intermediate varieties in the neighborhood of fixed points to toroidal maps .",
    "the latter can be factored into a sequence of smooth blow - ups by using the same combinatorial methods as for toric varieties .",
    "combining all the local factorizations together we get a global factorization .    in the presentation of birational cobordisms below",
    "we base on @xcite with some improvements in @xcite .",
    "in particular we use hironaka flattening for factorization into projective morphisms , and elements of git to show existence of quotients .",
    "the presentation of the paper is self contained .",
    "in particular the toric version of the weak factorization is proven in section [ toric ] to illustarate some of the ideas of the proof .",
