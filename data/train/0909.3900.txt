    "we have recently shown a remarkable connection between the description of hadronic modes in ads space and the hamiltonian formulation of qcd in physical space - time quantized on the light - front ( lf ) at fixed light - front time @xmath3 , the time marked by the front of a light wave ,  @xcite rather than at instant time @xmath4 , the ordinary time .",
    "in fact , we can use a first semiclassical approximation to transform the fixed lf time bound - state hamiltonian equation to a corresponding wave equation in ads space . to this end",
    ", we identify an invariant lf coordinate @xmath0 which allows the separation of the dynamics of quark and gluon binding from the kinematics of constituent spin and internal orbital angular momentum .",
    "@xcite the result is a single - variable lf relativistic schrdinger equation which determines the spectrum and lf wavefunctions ( lfwfs ) of hadrons for general spin and orbital angular momentum .",
    "this lf wave equation serves as a semiclassical first approximation to qcd , and it is equivalent to the equations of motion which describe the propagation of spin-@xmath1 modes on ads .",
    "remarkably , the ads equations yield the kinetic energy terms of the partons inside a hadron , whereas the interaction terms build confinement and correspond to truncation of ads space  @xcite in an effective dual gravity approximation .    in this note",

    "are explicitly introduced in the gauge / gravity correspondence , in contrast with the usual ads / qcd framework  @xcite where axial and vector currents become the primary entities as in effective chiral theory .",
    "we will also review some of the features of the `` hard - wall ''  @xcite and `` soft - wall ''  @xcite which provide an initial approximation to qcd . in our approach the holographic mapping",
    "is carried out in the strongly coupled regime where qcd is almost conformal , corresponding to an infrared fixed - point .",
