    "understanding strongly correlated electron materials is a significant theoretical challenge because they exhibit a variety of phases with exotic properties .",
    "a wide range of materials exhibits this behaviour , ranging from the transition metal oxides,@xcite high-@xmath2 cuprates superconductors,@xcite and heavy fermions compounds,@xcite to the organic charge transfer salts@xcite and iron based superconductors.@xcite in the metallic phase some have low - temperature properties consistent with the landau fermi liquid ( fl ) picture of conventional metals below a low energy scale , defined as coherence temperature @xmath1 .",
    "this low - temperature scale signals the breakdown of the fermi liquid picture and is orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath3 , the fermi temperature associated with the band structure for uncorrelated electrons .",
    "the family of organic salts @xmath4-(bedt - ttf)@xmath5x has @xmath6k , and a fermi temperature of @xmath7k.@xcite sr@xmath5ruo@xmath8 has @xmath9k@xcite and liv@xmath5o@xmath8 has @xmath10k,@xcite both with @xmath11k . above this coherence temperature ,",
    "a transfer of spectral weight to higher energies occurs and quasi - particles do not exist . these exotic states and the small coherence temperature , are associated with the proximity to a mott metal - insulator transition@xcite ( mit ) or a quantum critical point.@xcite    below @xmath1 the transport properties can be characterised by diffusive transport of coherent quasiparticle states , where the mean - free path is much larger than the lattice constant . in this regime , the resistivity often behaves as @xmath12 and is much less than the mott - ioffe - regel ( mir ) limit , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the lattice constant .",
    "however , above @xmath1 quasi - particles do not exist and the resistivity exceeds the mir limit ( the associated mean - free path would be smaller than the lattice spacing ) .",
    "hence , in these bad metallic states , boltzmann transport theory breaks down and a theoretical description is particularly challenging.@xcite other signatures of the crossover from a fl to a bad metal above @xmath1 are : an incoherent electron spectral function , collapse of the drude peak in the optical conductivity and shift of the associated spectral weight to higher frequencies , the entropy and specific heat becomes of order @xmath15 per particle , the thermopower becomes of order @xmath16 which is orders of magnitude larger than for elemental metals , and sometimes a non - monotonic temperature dependence of the hall constant and thermoelectric power.@xcite    the hubbard model is the simplest hamiltonian that captures the essential physics of the mott mit .",
    "significant theoretical progress has been made in the past two decades using dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft).@xcite this method provided a detailed picture of the evolution of the electronic structure with temperature and interaction strength . despite being exact only in the limit of either infinite lattice connectivity or spatial dimensionality ,",

    "several studies have used this method ( and variants ) for finite temperature on the one band hubbard model.@xcite but all of them have worked in the bipartite lattice , where a nesting in the fermi surface leads to magnetic order for finite coulomb interaction @xmath29 . to the best of our knowledge , no work explored the temperature dependence of the paramagnetic formulation , and in particular the coherence temperature of the fermi liquid . in a somewhat similar vein ,",
    "previous slave - boson studies of the anderson impurity model using the barnes - coleman representation identified a phase transition in the slave - boson field with the kondo temperature.@xcite    in this paper , we revisit the saddle point free - energy functional in the one band hubbard model , as originally presented by kotliar and ruckenstein ( equation 6 of ref .",

    "[ tcoh - generic],scaledwidth=46.0% ]    the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ method ] we briefly introduce the kotliar - ruckenstein ( kr ) slave - boson method for the single - band hubbard model . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our results for the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle weight , double occupancy , entropy and charge compressibility .",
    "we link the temperature where the quasiparticle weight strongly decreases to the coherence temperature in strongly correlated materials that signal the crossover to a bad metal regime .",

    "the stability of the method is analysed in terms of the positivity of the charge compressibility . finally , concluding remarks and future directions are discussed in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "our starting point is the one band hubbard model for interacting electrons on a lattice : @xmath42 as usual , @xmath43 creates ( anihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath44 at the site @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the corresponding occupation number , and @xmath47 .",
    "the hopping matrix element is @xmath48 , @xmath29 is the coulomb on - site repulsion , and @xmath49 the chemical potential which fixes the average electronic density @xmath50 .",

    "we have checked that similar results are obtained for different density of states .",
    "the quasiparticle weight @xmath0 is the spectral weight of the quasiparticle peak at the fermi energy .",
    "this peak involves the coherent excitations that form the fermi liquid , and its spectral weight decreases as the metal - insulator transition approached .",
    "it can also be understood as the renormalization factor of the fermionic band . for a fermi liquid it implies that",

    "the decrease of double occupancy with increasing temperature reveals the tendency of the system to a higher degree of localisation .     for @xmath112 .",
    "larger values of @xmath110 can be achieved because the system is metallic and does not go through a mit when @xmath29 is increased .",

    "the reduction of the entropy value at the transition with increasing @xmath29 ( end crosses at each solid line ) is consistent with the appearance of the kink like features found with dmft in ref . [ ] .",
    "the increase of entropy with @xmath29 , accompanied by the decrease of @xmath95 with @xmath41 , is an analogue of the pomeranchuk effect in liquid @xmath121he and is consistent with dmft results in the same model.@xcite [ n-100_s],scaledwidth=46.0% ]    in figure [ n-100_s ] we display the entropy density as a function of the temperature for various @xmath110 values , for the half - filling case . at low temperatures",

    "we also show with dotted lines the corresponding values of free on - site spin fluctuations , @xmath120 , and the high - temperature limit , @xmath118 , where charge and spin fluctuations are completely free .",
    "similar to dmft results in the low - temperature fermi liquid type regime,@xcite we obtain that the entropy increases as the system becomes further correlated . as we increase @xmath29 and approach the mott phase , the value of the entropy at @xmath1 ( end crosses at each solid line ) decrease .",
    "the latter can be related to the appearance of kink - like features of the entropy found with dmft.@xcite    the higher degree of localisation as temperature increases , expressed in the decreasing of @xmath95 ( inset of figure [ n-100_z ] ) , is characteristic in a strongly correlated fermi liquid in a regime dominated by spin fluctuations .",
    "this is a direct analogue of the pomeranchuck effect in liquid @xmath121he : because the spin entropy is much larger in a localized state than in the fermi liquid , the system can gain free energy @xmath122 when increasing the temperature by increasingly localizing the particles@xcite ( one can go from the itinerant to the localized phase upon heating ) .",

    "we numerically estimated the value of the charge compressibility @xmath126 this is a useful quantity in the study of the metal - insulator transition because it measures the particle stiffness of the system with a change in chemical potential .",
    "its inverse can be interpreted as the energy required to add or remove a particle from the system , which in half - filling agrees with the idea of the system becoming more incompressible ( @xmath127 going to zero ) as we approach the mott insulating phase.@xcite it is worth noting that an analytic calculation of @xmath127 from equation is complicated because @xmath50 has a dependence on the double occupancy @xmath89 ( due to the @xmath89-dependence of @xmath128 and @xmath102 ) , and the derivative against @xmath49 of the latter turns out to be difficult to calculate .     as a function of temperature , for several interaction values .",

    "we show the temperature vs. doping phase diagram for @xmath130 .",
    "we obtained a linear dependence of coherence temperature on doping for low @xmath139 , @xmath140 , which is qualitatively similar to dmft results.@xcite we also find , for temperatures higher than the red solid line , negative values of compressibility for the doped mott insulator , which is a signature of instabilities towards phase separation , incommensurate magnetic order , or other exotic electronic phases.@xcite this allows us to conclude that the slave - boson method remains stable in a broad region of the @xmath41-@xmath50 phase diagram , except for the small region near @xmath1 for @xmath141 , as can be seen in figure [ u-2_tcoh ] .",
    "we find similar behaviour in the sign of @xmath127 for other values of the interaction @xmath29 .",
    "we also tried different densities of states , and found that this instability is unrelated with the shape of @xmath142 .",
    "a recent slave - spin mean - field study of multi - orbital hubbard model has found that the hund s coupling is essential in the development of an instability region in the @xmath29-doping phase diagram.@xcite this instability region departs from the mott transition at half filling and is proposed to be related at finite-@xmath41 to a `` spin - freezing cross - over '' , signaled by a quick decrease of @xmath0 , increase of inter - orbital spin - spin correlation , and suppression of inter - orbital charge - charge correlations .",
    "in summary , we have studied the finite temperature kr slave - boson mean - field approach of the single - band hubbard model , and identify the temperature at which the fermi liquid collapse with the coherence temperature found in several strongly correlated materials that signal the appearance of the bad metal regime . for @xmath138",
    "our results agree with the physical picture of a renormalized fermi liquid state and are in good qualitative correspondence with dmft and finite temperature lanczos calculations .",
    "in particular , we find that near the mott transition the coherence temperature is much lower than the fermi temperature for @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath143 , .",
    "iron based superconductors have increased interest in the role of orbital degeneracy , hund s rule interaction @xmath144 , and multiple bands in strongly correlated electron materials .",
    "it was recently shown that @xmath144 has a conflicting effect on correlations.@xcite on the one hand , @xmath144 increases the critical @xmath29 above which a mott insulator is formed . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath144 reduces the fermi liquid coherence temperature significantly , leading to at higher temperatures what is referred to as a `` hund s metal'',@xcite which may be characterised by particularly slow spin dynamics.@xcite this is the multi - band analogue of the bad metal in a single band system . in a future study",
    "we plan to investigate how @xmath1 varies with @xmath144 in multi - band models using a finite - temperature version of rotationally invariant slave - bosons@xcite or slave - spins.@xcite at zero temperature the latter reproduces kr slave - boson mean - field results for the single - band hubbard model , and recently has been used to model fe - based superconductors.@xcite    a weakness of kr slave - bosons is that they do not capture the properties of the hubbard bands .",
    "this problem has been recently solved with a new gutzwiller variational wave function involving `` ghost '' orbitals.@xcite hopefully , a finite - temperature version of this method could also investigate the emergence of the bad metal with increasing temperature ."
