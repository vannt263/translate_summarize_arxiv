    "this can actually be done in several ways in the presence of a magnetic field ( see appendix  [ sec : correlation - functions ] for details ) .",
    "then , @xmath12 is just the characteristic length for the long - distance decay of @xmath13 . in order to arrive at an appropriate definition for finite lattice systems , one typically considers the propagator in fourier space , @xmath14 , and defines the second - moment correlation length @xmath15 from a truncated ornstein - zernike expansion eqs .   and  .",

    ", however , @xmath26 does exhibit very clear intersections , signalling the presence of a second - order phase transition .",
    "the dramatic improvement in the scaling , compared to the top panel , is explained by the pernicious effect on @xmath15 of the anomalous behaviour in the correlation function for zero momentum .",
    "[ fig : xi - r12 ] ]    in principle , at the transition point there should be scale invariance in the system , meaning that @xmath28 where @xmath20 is the thermal critical exponent and the dots represent corrections to leading scaling , expected to be unimportant for large lattice sizes .",
    "therefore , the curves of @xmath27 for large lattices should intersect at the critical point @xmath29 .",
    "previous attempts to find @xmath19 using this approach , however , have generally concluded that these intersections can not be found ( or , rather , that the apparent intersection point goes to @xmath30 as @xmath31 grows ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , if we look at the top panel of figure  [ fig : xi - r12 ] , we see that either there is no phase transition or @xmath15 is completely in a preasymptotic regime .",
    "some authors , working with @xmath32 models with long - range interactions , have already offered an explanation for this apparent lack of scale invariance : the propagator behaves anomalously , but only for the @xmath33 mode @xcite .",
    "this results in very strong corrections to the leading scaling term of eq .",
    ", since the second - moment correlation length depends on @xmath34 .",
    "we have checked numerically that this phenomenon is also at play in our @xmath4 system , which is probably a general consequence of the presence of goldstone bosons in the system ( see appendix  [ sec : correlation - functions ] for a discussion of this phenomenon ) .    in order to avoid this issue ,",
    "in this paper we take a novel approach , eschewing @xmath27 in favour of a new dimensionless ratio as the basic quantity for our finite - size scaling study . in particular , we shall consider ratios of higher momenta : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( and permutations ) are the smallest non - zero momenta compatible with the periodic boundary conditions . notice that , while our use of @xmath26 as a basic parameter is novel , this is not in any way a strange quantity . in fact , it is a universal renormalisation - group invariant , whose value in the large-@xmath31 limit for a paramagnetic system should be @xmath38 . at the critical point , however , @xmath39 .",
    "for instance , using conformal theory relations @xcite , we have computed the critical ratio exactly for the non - disordered @xmath40 ising model : @xmath41    to leading order , @xmath26 should have the same scaling behaviour as @xmath27 , namely , @xmath42}.\\ ] ] however , since this quantity avoids the anomalous @xmath33 mode , we expect that corrections to scaling be smaller . indeed , in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : xi - r12 ] we can see that the improvement in the scaling from the @xmath15 case is dramatic . even though corrections to scaling are noticeable , for large sizes the intersections of the curves seem to converge .",
    "notice as well that the high values of @xmath26 in the neighbourhood of the intersection point are not only far from the paramagnetic limit of @xmath43 , but also above the bound @xmath44 that would result from a smooth behaviour of the propagator ( see the discussion following eq .  ) .",
    "therefore , it is our working hypothesis that there is a phase transition , but one that is affected by large corrections to scaling . to substantiate this statement and",
    "actually compute the critical parameters , we must begin by somehow controlling these corrections .",
    "this analysis is rather technical , but not critical to our discussion , so we leave it for appendix  [ sec : omega ] , where we study the behaviour of @xmath27 at fixed @xmath26 as a function of @xmath31 . to leading order",
    ", this should be a constant , so it has allowed us to isolate the effect of the scaling corrections , parameterised as an extra term in @xmath45 in   and  , where @xmath46    now that we have the scaling corrections exponent @xmath47 , we can go back to study @xmath26 . the easiest way to compute the critical parameters ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , etc . ) from a renormalisation - group invariant such as @xmath26 is the quotients method @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in our case the corrections to scaling are strong , and for some lattice sizes we do not actually reach the intersection point .",

    "we compute the temperature @xmath51 for which @xmath56 . for @xmath53 inside the scaling region , these temperatures should approach the critical one according to  .",
    "we perform a joint fit for all the data sets in the plot , forcing all of them to share the same @xmath20 and forcing all sets with the same @xmath11 to extrapolate to the same @xmath57 .",

    "we have thus been able to obtain a precise determination of @xmath57 and of the critical exponent @xmath20 .",
    "it is important to mention that the value of @xmath20 which , as we have seen , is universal for @xmath48 , is very different from that of the @xmath23 case . as a consistency check of our non - standard finite - size scaling method",

    "we first perform a number of iterations large enough to ensure thermalisation in a large fraction of the samples ( typically 90% ) .",
    "we study the autocorrelation of the temperature flow during the parallel tempering and extend the runs for the slower samples until a total length of 14 exponential autocorrelation times is ensured .",

    "the @xmath68 lattices were simulated on the janus computer with an update speed ( for each of its 256 units ) of @xmath72 ps per spin flip with a heat bath scheme .",
    "the @xmath73 lattices were simulated on pc clusters , with a c code that uses multi - spin coding @xcite with 128-bit words ( using the sse extensions ) ; the update speed in this case is 350 ps per spin flip using a metropolis algorithm ( on an intel core2 processor at 2.40ghz ) with multi - spin coding , the samples whose simulations have to be extended must be extracted from the original 128-sample bundles to construct new bundles that are then extended with the same code .",
    "note finally that , since the pc spreads the spin - flips over 128 samples , the simulation for each sample is faster on janus by a factor @xmath74 .",
    "this difference is significant when the equilibration time is large .",

    "this results in small monte carlo errors with a modest number of configurations , so the uncertainty on the final result is dominated by the sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "this step is rather time consuming , so we also use multi - spin coding to accomplish it .    in order to define the second - moment correlation length @xcite",

    "then , the common second - moment correlation length @xmath15 is obtained by truncating the expansion at the @xmath84 term : @xmath85    as we comment in the main text , this definition is not well behaved for our model , due to the anomalous behaviour of the @xmath33 mode . actually , there is a simple , yet unexpected explanation for this anomaly .",
    "it arises whenever soft excitations ( goldstone bosons ) are present in the low - temperature phase , while an external magnetic field splits excitations into longitudinal and transversal @xcite .",
    "familiar examples of goldstone bosons are magnons , or the phonons in an acoustical branch .",
    "what is most peculiar about spin glasses is that soft modes are present @xcite , even if our variables are discrete .",

    "the deviation from the leading scaling was milder , but still strong enough that we can not ignore it in our analysis .",
    "therefore , it becomes necessary to parameterize the corrections .",
    "since the number of lattice sizes is not enough to fit for the leading order behavior and the corrections at the same time , our strategy has been isolating the latter . in order",

    "we see in the figure that this behavior is indeed realized at high temperatures ( low values of @xmath26 ) but that , close to the transition point , the deviations become very strong . therefore , by fixing the value of @xmath26 and studying the evolution of @xmath27 with the system size we can isolate the corrections to scaling .",
    "these include an enormous variety of effects , but the standard practice is to consider simply the leading corrections , characterized by an exponent @xmath47 @xmath87 notice that the extrapolation to infinite volume depends only on @xmath26 , but that the amplitude of the corrections depends also separately on the magnetic field @xmath11 .",

    "notice , however , that for its computation we had to restrict the fit to lattice sizes @xmath91 . for smaller systems ,",
    "the effect of subleading corrections to scaling is very important , as evinced by the curvature in the plots of the figure .     against @xmath26 at @xmath25 .",
    "to leading scaling order , this curve should be independent of the system size , a prediction that is realized at low values of @xmath26 ( i.e. , far from the critical point ) .",
    "close to the critical point , however , strong scaling corrections appear .",

    "we do know , however , that among them is a series on powers of @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , we can consider an effective parameterization of the corrections in the following way @xmath93 if we redo the computation of figure  [ fig : sup2 ] in this non - standard way , including lattices with @xmath94 we obtain a value of @xmath95 . at a first glance",

    "<S> spin glasses are a longstanding model for the sluggish dynamics that appears at the glass transition . however </S>",
    "<S> , spin glasses differ from structural glasses for a crucial feature : they enjoy a time reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this symmetry can be broken by applying an external magnetic field , but embarrassingly little is known about the critical behaviour of a spin glass in a field . in this context , the space dimension is crucial . </S>",
    "<S> simulations are easier to interpret in a large number of dimensions , but one must work below the upper critical dimension ( i.e. , in @xmath0 ) in order for results to have relevance for experiments . here we show conclusive evidence for the presence of a phase transition in a four - dimensional spin glass in a field . </S>",
    "<S> two ingredients were crucial for this achievement : massive numerical simulations were carried out on the janus special - purpose computer , and a new and powerful finite - size scaling method .    </S>",
    "<S> the glass transition differs from standard phase transitions in that the equilibration time of glass formers ( supercooled liquids , polymers , proteins , superconductors , etc . ) </S>",
    "<S> diverges without dramatic changes in their structural properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reconciliation of the dynamic slowdown with the apparent immutability of glass formers is a major challenge for condensed matter physics .    </S>",
    "<S> spin glasses ( which are disordered magnetic alloys @xcite ) enjoy a privileged status in this context , as they provide the simplest model system both for theoretical and experimental studies of a glassy dynamics . on the experimental side , </S>",
    "<S> time - dependent magnetic fields provide a wonderful tool to probe the dynamic response , which can be accurately measured with a squid ( for instance , see @xcite ) . on the theoretical side , </S>",
    "<S> magnetic systems are notably easier to model and to simulate numerically . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , special - purpose computers have been built for the simulation of spin glasses @xcite .    yet , </S>",
    "<S> spin glasses differ from most glassy systems in a crucial feature : like all magnetic systems , they enjoy time - reversal symmetry in the absence of an applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we now know that their glassy dynamics is due to a bona fide phase transition in which the time - reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken @xcite . yet , in the presence of an applied magnetic field , the experimental spin - glass dynamics is just as glassy , although the field explicitly breaks the symmetry .    however , whether spin glasses in a magnetic field undergo a phase transition has been a long - debated and still open question ( see @xcite for recent , opposed views ) . in the mean - field approximation , which is valid for large spatial dimension down to the upper critical dimension @xmath1 @xcite , the de almeida - thouless line  @xcite separates the high - temperature paramagnetic phase from the glassy phase   @xcite . ] . </S>",
    "<S> yet , recent numerical simulations in spatial dimensions below @xmath2 did not find the transition in a field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental studies have been conducted as well , with conflicting conclusions @xcite . in spite of this , it has been argued that the would - be spin - glass transition in a magnetic field sets the universality class for the thermodynamic glass transition @xcite .    here , we present conclusive evidence for a spin - glass transition in the presence of an external magnetic field in the four - dimensional edwards - anderson model ( hence , well below @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result was obtained by means of a large - scale numerical simulation , partly carried out on the janus computer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> due to some pathologies of the spin - glass correlation function @xcite , our analysis method departs from the standard one . </S>",
    "<S> we compute critical exponents , widely differing from the zero field case , with an accuracy of five percent . </S>",
    "<S> the failure of previous work to identify the transition is explained in terms of very strong corrections to scaling . </S>"
