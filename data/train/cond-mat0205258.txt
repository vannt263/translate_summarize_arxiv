    "the non homogeneity of the polarization and other properties is known to be a characteristic feature of ferroelectric thin films .",
    "the physical reason of this phenomenon is related to the influence of the films surface , where , e.g. , the polarization differs essentially from that in the bulk .",
    "because of this polarization heterogeneity , the phenomenological approach to its calculation was based on the solution of euler - lagrange and lame type differential equations respectively for polarization and dielectric susceptibility with specific boundary conditions [ 1,2 ] . because the analytical solution of these equations appeared to be cumbersome , their solution was performed numerically in most of the papers , mainly for batio@xmath2 and pbtio@xmath3 ( see e.g. [ 3,4,5 ] ) .",
    "therefore the analytical calculations of the film properties appeared to be more complex than in bulk materials , where the minimization of the free energy as a power series of homogeneous polarization makes it possible to calculate the properties analytically by a simple way .",
    "the real situation in films is even more complex because of the depolarization field contribution , which , contrary to the bulk , is non zero even in short circuited films because of the polarization non homogeneity .",
    "although the depolarization field is able to completely destroy ferroelectric polarization [ 6 ] there are only a few works devoted to calculations of its contribution to the film properties [ 7 ] .",
    "the majority of the authors performed the calculations without taking into account the depolarization field effect [ 3,4,5 ] .",
    "it might be supposed that the flattening of the polarization via the depolarization field contribution , as shown in [ 7 ] , could create conditions for a simplification of the thin film properties description , particularly on the basis of a free energy expansion similar to that in bulk materials , but with renormalized coefficients .",
    "such approach was successfully applied recently to the description of thin films [ 8 ] and nanomaterials [ 9 ] . however , up to now , there was no fundamental background for such a simplified approach .",
    "in addition , nothing was discussed about the properties profiles , which can not be obtained from conventional expansion of the free energy as a power series of the polarization .    in the present work",
    "we show for the first time that polarization and other properties averaged over the film thickness can be found by the minimization of the free energy with the same form as known for the bulk materials , but with the coefficient before square polarization depending upon temperature and film thickness , and featuring the extrapolation length and coefficient before polarization gradient .",
    "the space distribution of the polarization is calculated using the analytical solution of the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "the amplitude of this distribution is shown to be equal to the average polarization with a good accuracy and can thus be obtained from the aforementioned free energy .",
    "the depolarization field contribution is taken into account in the model which was proposed in [ 7 ] for single domain ferroelectric films under short circuit conditions , ferroelectric treated as a perfect insulator .",
    "this model seems to be reasonable because the thinner the film the better the conditions for single domain state appearance ( see e.g. [ 2 ] , [ 10 ] ) .",
    "in addition , for many perovskite ferroelectrics , the conductivity can be small enough [ 11 ] . to analyze the depolarization field effect",
    "we perform a detailed comparison of the properties calculated with and without taking into account the depolarization field .",
    "let us consider a thin ferroelectric film polarized along the @xmath4-axis ( i.e. @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , which is perpendicular to the surface of the film .",
    "this type of polarization can appear as a result of self - polarization of a film grown under special technological condition without application of any external electric field [ 12,13 ] . since the type of substrate and electrode was shown to be important , the mechanical strain related to the mismatch of the substrate and the film lattice constants and the thermal expansion coefficients can contribute to a self - polarization phenomenon .",
    "the polarization equilibrium value can be obtained in the framework of the phenomenological thermodynamic theory from the minimum of the functional of the free energy [ 14 ] . in the considered case of polarization perpendicular to the surface of the film ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account the depolarization field , which is proportional to the value of polarization and has the opposite direction , in such a way that it lowers or even cancels @xmath7 . in accepted models ,",
    "the ferroelectric is regarded as a perfect insulator under short - circuit conditions .",
    "taking into account the symmetry of the considered structure ( i.e. the film polarization depends on the coordinate @xmath8 only ) one can write the free energy density functional for phase transitions of the 1st and 2nd order ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively ) as follows :    @xmath11 dz+ \\\\ & & + \\frac \\delta { 2l}\\left ( \\frac{p_z^2(0)}{\\lambda _ 1}+\\frac{p_z^2(l)}{% \\lambda _ 2}\\right ) + 2\\pi \\left [ \\frac 1l\\int\\limits_0^lp_z^2(z)dz-\\left (   \\frac 1l\\int\\limits_0^lp_z^2(z)dz\\right ) ^2\\right ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath12 is the thickness of the film , the coefficient @xmath13 depends on temperature @xmath14 as @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the temperature of the transition from paraelectric to ferroelectric phase in the bulk ferroelectric , @xmath17 is the external electric field , @xmath18 are extrapolation lengths .",
    "the last two and the previous two terms represent the depolarization field energy and surface energy respectively . in what follows we will consider the case of positive extrapolation lengths , i.e. , when polarization on the surface is smaller then in the center of the film . only in this case surface effects",
    "can lead to a size - driven phase transition [ 1 ] .",
    "the minimization of the functional ( 1 ) leads to the following equation determining the space distribution of polarization over the thickness of the film :    @xmath19    with boundary conditions on the surfaces of the film :    @xmath20    the last two terms in eq .",
    "( 2a ) represent the depolarization field :    @xmath21    here the first term is the depolarization field for the free standing film , and the second one is the compensating field of free charges on the short - circuiting electrodes . the depolarization field ( 3 )",
    "is of course zero when the polarization space distribution is homogeneous .",
    "equation ( 2a ) for the polarization space distribution is a non - linear inhomogeneous integral differential equation and is cumbersome to solve analytically .",
    "but in the paraelectric phase , where the spontaneous polarization @xmath22 equals zero and the polarization is only proportional to the external field , the non - linear terms in eq .",
    "( 2a ) can be negligibly small .",
    "therefore the solution of this linear equation can be expressed in terms of elementary functions . with boundary conditions ( 2b ) , the space distribution of the polarization in this case has the following form :    @xmath23    here all @xmath4 indexes are omitted , angle bracket means @xmath4 coordinate averaging and the following definitions are introduced :    @xmath24    the average polarization of the film can be easily derived from ( 4 ) :    @xmath25    note that in the case @xmath26 the space distribution of the polarization in the paraelectric phase ( 4 ) and its average value ( 6 ) coincides with those obtained earlier [ 7 ] .",
    "the derivative @xmath27 represents the linear dielectric susceptibility of the film .",
    "the analysis of expression ( 6 ) has shown that the value of @xmath28 is positive when either @xmath29 ( i.e. @xmath30 , @xmath31 - paraelectric phase of bulk ferroelectrics ) or @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( @xmath34- ferroelectric phase of bulk ferroelectrics ) .",
    "the dielectric susceptibility diverges for @xmath35 , and the considered system undergoes a phase transition .    because of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 dependences on thickness and temperature , equation @xmath35 determines accordingly the critical temperature @xmath0 at fixed thickness or critical thickness @xmath1 at fixed temperature .",
    "note that these critical parameters correspond to the points where the ferroelectric phase loses its stability ( 1st order phase transition ) or to the critical temperature and thickness for a 2nd order ferroelectric phase transition .",
    "the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath38 can be estimated respectively as @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the dielectric permittivity and correlation radius of the bulk ferroelectric in the paraelectric phase respectively .",
    "therefore for conventional values of these quantities @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "these inequalities essentially simplify the form of @xmath45 and @xmath46 so the equation determining the phase transition point can be rewritten as follows :    @xmath47    the critical thickness is readily obtained from this expression :    @xmath48 ,   \\eqnum{8 } \\label{8}\\ ] ]    and the critical temperature    @xmath49 , \\quad l_0(0)=\\sqrt{\\frac \\delta { \\alpha _ 0t_c% } } .",
    "\\eqnum{9 }   \\label{9}\\ ] ]    here @xmath50 is the correlation length at zero temperature . as it follows from eq .",
    "( 9 ) , if the thickness value is less than @xmath51 , then the critical temperature becomes negative , i.e. phase transition vanishes .",
    "therefore the ferroelectric phase transition in a film can be achieved by changing the film thickness at some fixed temperature or by varying the temperature of the film with given thickness . as a matter of fact",
    "the curve described by equation ( 9 ) determines the phase boundaries between the paraelectric and ferroelectric phases , i.e. the phase diagram of the film in temperature - thickness coordinates , which is depicted in fig.1 by solid curves for different values of the extrapolation lengths .",
    "the critical thickness values @xmath52 are the intersections of the curves with the abscissa axis .",
    "namely , at @xmath53 , the paraelectric phase ( polarization @xmath54 ) exists in the whole temperature region , while at @xmath55 both ferroelectric phase ( @xmath56 ) at @xmath57 and paraelectric phase at @xmath58 are present .",
    "it should be noticed that paraelectric and ferroelectric phases should coexist in the fe region of fig . 1 for first order phase transitions .",
    "to clear up the effect of the depolarization field we also conducted calculations without any depolarization field contribution .",
    "the results of the calculations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for 2nd order phase transitions are given in the appendix ( eqs .",
    "( a5 ) , ( a6 ) ) and in fig .",
    "1 ( dashed curves ) .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "1 that the depolarization field decreases the critical temperature and increases the critical thickness .",
    "these effects are stronger when decreasing the extrapolation lengths values ( compare solid and dashed curves in fig.1 ) .",
    "it is clearly seen , from the inset of fig .",
    "1 , that @xmath59 ( solid curves ) , while without the depolarization field contribution @xmath60 ( dashed curves ) . a more detailed critical thickness dependence on the extrapolation lengths is represented in fig .",
    "2 . one can see that the greater the @xmath61 and @xmath62 values , the smaller the @xmath1 value .",
    "the latter can be related to the flattening of the polarization space distribution on increasing the values of the extrapolation lengths , that results into a critical thickness decrease and in a critical temperature increase(compare curves 1 , 2 and 3 in fig.1 ) .",
    "when inequalities @xmath63 and @xmath32 are valid , the polarization derived by equation ( 4 ) becomes negative , and the non - linearity in equation ( 2a ) can not be neglected .",
    "in the ferroelectric phase ( the region @xmath55 and @xmath57 ) the non- linearity should be taken into consideration . the simplest way to take it into account is the direct variational method .",
    "we choose solution ( 4 ) as a trial function and an amplitude factor will be treated as a variational parameter .",
    "the condition of fe existence @xmath64 can be fulfilled because of small @xmath36 and @xmath38 values . allowing for @xmath65 we will look for a polarization space distribution in the ferroelectric phase with the following form :    @xmath66    here @xmath67 is the variational parameter that represents the amplitude of the polarization space distribution .",
    "after calculation of integral ( 1 ) with the trial function ( 10 ) , one can easily obtain the free energy density as follows :    @xmath68    keeping in mind that the polarization average value is @xmath69one can rewrite eq.(11a ) as :    @xmath70    where the following definitions have been used    @xmath71    it is worth to underline that the terms in eq .",
    "( 1 ) which correspond to surface energy , depolarizing field and polarization gradient contribute to the first term in eqs .",
    "therefore the main peculiarities of thin film properties have to be related to the coefficient of the second power of the polarization .",
    "it can be seen that eqs .",
    "( 11a ) and ( 11b ) have the form of power series of the amplitude of the polarization space distribution and average polarization respectively .",
    "these equations can be easily rewritten in the conventional for bulk ferroelectric form    @xmath72    and    @xmath73    where the coefficients @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 can be obtained from the comparison of eqs .",
    "( 11a , b ) and ( 13a , b ) , namely    @xmath80    and    @xmath81    in the general case , the coefficients ( 14a , b ) depend on the temperature , the film thickness , the extrapolation lengths and the coefficient before polarization gradient , as it follows from eqs .",
    "( 12 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 5 ) . at first glance",
    "these dependencies seem to be rather complex , although they have been already simplified due to inequalities @xmath82 , @xmath83 . a further simplification of the coefficients ( 14 ) was made by rewriting them via the critical temperature @xmath84 or via the critical thickness @xmath85 ( see the left hand side part of eq .",
    "the first or the second type of the coefficients representation can be useful when studying respectively the temperature ( at given thickness ) or thickness ( at fixed temperature ) dependencies of the film properties . in the first case the coefficients @xmath74 in ( 14a ) and @xmath77 in ( 14b ) can be rewritten as :    @xmath86   \\eqnum{15a }   \\label{15a}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath87    an estimation of the second multipliers in eqs .",

    "we should underline once more that the critical temperature @xmath98 depends on @xmath12 and the critical thickness @xmath1 depends on @xmath14 , and both of them are functions of the extrapolation lengths and parameter @xmath99 ( see figs . 1 , 2 and eqs .",

    "this is because we chose the trial function for the description of the polarization profile in the form obtained for the paraelectric phase ( see eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) and used the inequality @xmath65 , @xmath43 , which are valid practically for any thin film , as discussed earlier .    since the formulas which express the physical properties via the free energy coefficients for both first and second order phase transitions are of the common knowledge ( see e.g. [ 15 ] )",
    ", we shall consider only polarization , dielectric susceptibility and pyrocoefficients with special attention to their thickness and temperature dependencies , which are the characteristic features of ferroelectric thin films .",
    "for sake of simplicity , we shall represent , in what follows , these dependencies for the second order phase transition .",
    "special attention will be payed to depolarization field contribution to find out the cases and conditions at which these field effects are more or less important qualititavely or quantitatively .",
    "the profiles of the physical properties are defined by the function ( @xmath104 ) in eq .",
    "( 10 ) and their amplitudes can be found by conventional minimization of free energy ( 13a ) with the coefficients ( 16a ) , ( 16b ) .",

    "here @xmath67 , @xmath28 and @xmath110 are the amplitudes of the polarization , dielectric susceptibility and pyrocoefficient which have to be multiplied by ( @xmath111 ) to obtain these properties profiles . the formulas ( 17a ) , ( 18a ) and ( 17b ) , ( 18b ) can be applied when studying respectively temperature ( at fixed film thickness ) and thickness ( at fixed temperature ) dependencies .",

    "it can be easily seen that the profiles remain smooth in the most part of the film even for thin films with thickness close to the critical value @xmath1 ( see solid curves 1 and 2 ) .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained by the influence of the depolarization field that tends to flatten the polarization space distribution as it will be shown later .",
    "the thickness and temperature dependencies of the properties can be obtained directly by minimization of the free energy ( 13b ) with respect to eqs .",

    "a characteristic feature of the properties temperature dependencies is the shift of the average properties anomalies to lower temperature on decreasing the film thickness . since the divergences of @xmath28 and @xmath110 are related to the temperature of the thickness induced ferroelectric phase transition ( see eqs .",

    "it can be seen that this field influence depends on the film thickness : the thinner the film the stronger the change in the profile shape .",
    "comparison of solid and dashed curves in figs .",
    "3 , 4 , 5 shows that the depolarization field increases @xmath28 and @xmath184 values , but decreases the @xmath67 value for the thin film close to the critical thickness , while for thick films , a decrease in @xmath28 and @xmath110 and an increase in @xmath22 are observed in most part of the film ( see curve 5 ) .",
    "it is worth to notice that the dashed curves in figs .",
    "4 , 5 display small maxima near the surfaces contrary to solid curves which remains flat .",
    "it is clear that the influence of the depolarization field on the polarization is directly related to the peculiarities of depolarisation field profile ( see fig .",
    "in particular the positive sign of @xmath185 in the tiny regions close to the surfaces and negative sign outside these regions explains the increase of the spontaneous polarization near the surfaces and its decrease in most part of the film , leading to the flattening of the polarization ( see fig .",
    "the difference in the behaviors induced by the depolarization field effect on @xmath22 on one hand , and @xmath28 and @xmath110 , which are the derivative of @xmath22 , on the other hand , is not surprising , since , e.g. , @xmath186 , and an increase in @xmath22 should result in a @xmath187 decrease and vice versa .",
    "let us discuss briefly the accuracy of the calculations and the physical model we used here .",
    "the variational method used for the calculation of the polarization in the ferroelectric phase is an approximation , its accuracy being usually a few percent . to prove this we performed the calculations in two important cases by other exact ways : in the vicinity of the phase transition , where @xmath22 tends to zero and",
    "can be considered as a small parameter , and for the thick film limit , when the polarization space distribution is almost uniform .",
    "the solutions obtained by these methods are reported in the inset of figs . 3 , 4 , 5 by dashed and dotted - dashed lines .",
    "it can be seen that these lines coincide with those obtained by the variational method with a good accuracy .    in our calculations",
    "we did not take into account the possible shift of @xmath16 by mechanical strains originating from the misfit between the substrate and the film lattice constants , thermal expansion coefficients and growth imperfections .",
    "because of the strain relaxation due to misfit dislocations , the strains are not homogeneous and in the general case their value are small in most part of the film [ 16 ] .",
    "we accordingly neglected the renormalization of @xmath16 value by mechanical strains .",
    "let us discuss briefly the depolarization field effect .",
    "as it follows from the above considerations , the depolarization field does not change the general form of @xmath22 , @xmath28 and @xmath110 average values dependences on the film thickness and temperature ( see figs .",
    "the depolarization field smoothes the space distributions of these quantities , and in particular cancels the maxima near the film surfaces in the space distributions of @xmath188 and @xmath110 obtained in the case where the depolarization field can be neglected ( see figs . 4 , 5 ) .",
    "the main effect of the depolarization field is the shift of the boundary between the paraelectric and ferroelectric phases on the temperature - film thickness phase diagram to larger thickness , as can be seen from fig .",
    "1 . this shift can be especially large for thin films because the critical temperature @xmath0 obeys a @xmath189 dependence when taking into account depolarization field contribution ( see eq .",

    "1 ) but a @xmath190 without this contribution ( see eqs .",

    "because of that a scattering of experimental critical values can be expected for films produced in different technological conditions and from materials with different degrees of purity",
    ". these factors might influence the domain structure and conductivity of the film and consequently the depolarization field .",
    "obviously depolarization field effects in thick films under short - circuit conditions can be neglected in most part of the film except close to the surfaces .",
    "but another important case where the contribution of the depolarization field can be neglected is related to the conditions on the film surfaces .",
    "more particularly , for extrapolation lengths much larger than the correlation length @xmath191 it follows from eq .",
    "( a6c ) that @xmath192 and eq . ( a6c )",
    "looks like eq .",
    "although we considered spontaneous polarization and other properties without any external electric field application , the case of @xmath193 can be considered on the basis of eq .",
    "( 13 ) , i.e. , in the same way as nonlinear effects in the bulk .",
    "it should be mentioned that a non linear dielectric response was measured in ba@xmath194sr@xmath195tio@xmath3 thin films with thickness 24 - 160 nm [ 8 ] .",
    "authors of this work explained the observed temperature and @xmath196-field dependencies using a conventional power series expansion of the free energy .",
    "they came to the conclusion that only the first term of this power series varies significantly with the film thickness or the temperature .",
    "this conclusion is in very good agreement with the results obtained in our work .",
    "the spatial distribution of the pyroelectric coefficient measured by limm method in homogeneously poled ferroelectric polymer films [ 17 ] looks like that depicted in fig .",
    "5 . this may give some support to the relevance of the calculated profiles of polarization and dielectric susceptibility .",
    "the obtained results pave the way to calculations of ferroelectric film properties using a conventional minimization of the free energy for bulk material , but with renormalized coefficient before squared polarization .",
    "this renormalized coefficient includes the contribution of polarization gradient , depolarization field , polarization at the surface and the characteristics of the bulk material . because this coefficient has been shown to depend on the critical parameters of the thickness induced ferroelectric phase transition @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the same way as this coefficient temperature dependence in the bulk , namely , for the films , @xmath197 or @xmath198 ( see eq .",
    "( 16 ) ) , this makes it possible to obtain these critical parameters through the observation of thermodynamic properties anomalies , e.g. by measurements of the average dielectric susceptibility maximum position at different temperatures at fixed thickness or at fixed temperature and different film thickness respectively .",
    "the novel approach developed here is suitable for the calculation of the profiles and average values of the polarization , dielectric susceptibility , pyrocoefficient , entropy , specific heat etc . in order to calculate the electromechanical properties",
    ", we have to include into the free energy functional the interaction of the non homogeneous polarization with external strains .",
    "this consideration is in progress now .",
    "in order to discuss the influence of the depolarization field , let us consider briefly the model without taking into account that field . in this case the equation giving the space distribution of polarization as a function of the thickness of the film has the form eq .",
    "( 2a ) without the last two terms .",
    "this equation has a nontrivial solution when the electric field is zero . in the case of boundary conditions ( 2b ) with positive extrapolation lengths ,",
    "this solution exists only under the condition @xmath199 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) and gives the following space distribution of the spontaneous polarization for the phase transition of the second order : @xmath200 here @xmath191= @xmath201 is the correlation length , @xmath202 is the elliptic sine function @xcite , and the constants @xmath203 and @xmath204 have to be determined from the boundary conditions ( 2b ) . using the properties of the elliptic functions it is easy to obtain equations which these constants satisfy : @xmath205 @xmath206 where @xmath207 and @xmath208 are complete and incomplete elliptic integrals of the first kind respectively @xcite , and the following definition",
    "is introduced : @xmath209 the parameter m varies from 0 to 1 in eqs .",
    "( a1 ) - ( a4 ) , otherwise the spontaneous polarization would be a complex number . as it follows from eq .",
    "( a3 ) with the condition @xmath210 , thickness @xmath12tends to some critical value @xmath1 which corresponds to a zero value of the spontaneous polarization ( a1 ) .",
    "when the thickness of the film is less than critical , the spontaneous polarization vanishes .",
    "the critical thickness for the considered case @xmath211 , @xmath212 has the form : @xmath213 the critical temperature @xmath0 for a film with thickness @xmath12 can be found from the condition @xmath214 , which results in a transcendental equation for the dependence of @xmath0 on the film parameters .",
    "this equation can be simplified in several limiting cases . when the phase transition temperature is much smaller than in the bulk ferroelectric ( @xmath215 ) , i.e. , for very thin films ,",
    "the following dependence can be obtained : @xmath216 here @xmath52 and @xmath217 are the critical thickness and correlation length respectively at zero temperature @xmath120 , and @xmath218    when the phase transition temperature is of the same order of magnitude as in the bulk ferroelectric ( @xmath219 ) , i.e. for films with large thickness , it is easy to get from eq.(a5 ) the following expression : @xmath220    note that this expression is also valid in the whole temperature and thickness ranges for extrapolation lengths much smaller then the correlation length ( @xmath221 ) . in the opposite case ,",
    "i.e. @xmath222 , the critical temperature is expressed as : @xmath223    since @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the temperature of the ferroelectric phase transition of the thick film , the nonhomogeneous polarization of the film @xmath224 should depend on temperature @xmath14 and external electric field @xmath196 .",
    "this allows to calculate the non homogeneous pyrocoefficient @xmath225 and the linear dielectric susceptibility @xmath226 .",
