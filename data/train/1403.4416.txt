    "bi@xmath0wo@xmath1 is the end member of the aurivillius family ( @xmath10 ) and possesses many interesting physical properties such as ferroelectricity associated to a large spontaneous polarization ( p @xmath11 50 @xmath12c/@xmath13 ) and a high curie temperature ( t@xmath14=950@xmath15c ) , piezoelectricity making it a potential alternative to batio@xmath3 and pbzr@xmath16ti@xmath17o@xmath3 solid solutions for applications at higher frequencies and temperatures  @xcite , high oxide ion conductivity  @xcite , and photocatalytic activity  @xcite .",

    "its ground state is an orthorhombic @xmath18 ( c@xmath19 ) ferroelectric structure that is related to a hypothetical paraelectric @xmath20 ( d@xmath21 ) phase through the condensation of three unstable modes : a rotation of oxygen octahedra around the @xmath22-axis ( @xmath23 ) , a tilt of octahedra around the @xmath24-axis ( @xmath25 ) , and a polar zone - center distortion along the @xmath24-axis ( @xmath26 ) .",

    "born effective charges , dielectric tensors and dynamical matrix ( yielding the phonon frequencies and eigenvectors ) were obtained within a variational approach to density functional perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the raman susceptibilities , the second - order nonlinear optical susceptibilities and the pockels tensor have been obtained within a nonlinear response formalism taking advantage of the 2@xmath421 theorem  @xcite . the infrared absorption and raman spectra were respectively calculated as described in refs .",

    "only the most significant contributions are retained .",
    "these two tables show the good qualitative agreement between our predictions and the experimental data .",
    "however , we note from table  [ overlap ] that , due to the underestimation of the lda volume , the amplitude of the distortions are globally underestimated in the relaxed structure . similarly , the larger volume of the experimental structure leads to an increase of the @xmath26 ( 29 @xmath53 ) stable polar mode and to a deacrease of the @xmath22-axis rotation of oxygen octahedra ( @xmath23 mode ) .",

    "<S> the structural , dielectric , dynamical , elastic , piezoelectric and nonlinear optical ( second - order susceptibility and pockels tensors ) properties of bi@xmath0wo@xmath1 in its p2@xmath2 ferroelectric ground state are determined using density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of infrared and raman spectra on single crystal allowed us to clarify the assignment of experimental phonon modes , considering the good agreement between the calculated and the experimental raman spectra obtained on polycrystal . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the elastic constants confirms the elastic stability of the crystal and allow us to estimate the young and shear moduli of polycrystalline samples . </S>",
    "<S> the piezoelectric constants have significant intrinsic values comparable to those of prototypical abo@xmath3 ferroelectrics . the electro - optic response is strongly dominated by the ionic contribution of transverse optic modes , yielding sizable pockels coefficients around 9 pm / v along the polar direction . </S>"
