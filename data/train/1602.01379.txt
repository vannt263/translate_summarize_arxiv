    "road design consists of finding a three - dimensional route alignment on the ground surface .",
    "it aims to connect two terminals ( the start and the end of a road ) at minimum possible cost and maximal utility , subject to design , environmental , and social constraints @xcite .",
    "since the number of alternative routes connecting two end points is unlimited , a traditional route location analysis , which has relied heavily on human judgement and intuition , may overlook many good alternatives @xcite . in order to consider all such route alternatives , and to reduce the workload for engineers , several automated procedures that determine good road alignments and approximate construction costs",
    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "the automation of the road design problem reduces the tedious and error - prone manual tasks , most notably drafting @xcite .",
    "in addition , this procedure allows the use of optimization techniques in search of a good alignment @xcite .",
    "optimization techniques save design time and provide the decision maker with powerful tools that search for an alignment with minimum cost from a large number of alternative alignments . in fact , optimization of road alignment can yield considerable savings in construction costs when compared with unoptimized design procedures @xcite .",
    "the road design problem can be broken down into three interconnected stages : the horizontal alignment , the vertical alignment , and the earthwork @xcite .",
    "the horizontal alignment is a bird s eye view of a road trajectory . a typical horizontal alignment is composed of a sequence of tangents , circular curves , and transition curves .",
    "transition curves have the property that the radius of curvature changes progressively along them .",
    "the main considerations in horizontal alignment design are that it should avoid lands which are restricted or expensive to purchase , obstacles which present engineering difficulties , and ground which may involve large amount of earthwork .",
    "the cost of road construction for the horizontal alignment problem depends on the cost of acquiring land and on the output of the vertical alignment stage @xcite .",
    "optimization of the horizontal alignment seeks a low cost route while adhering to the design standards and reducing environmental impacts  @xcite . however , optimization of horizontal alignment should also seek a highly utile route",
    ". these two goals may often be in conflict with each other . in the literature ,",
    "the following models have been developed for optimizing horizontal alignments : calculus of variation @xcite , network optimization @xcite , dynamic programming @xcite , and genetic algorithms @xcite . detailed discussion on the advantages and disadvantage of these methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "the vertical alignment is the view of the centreline of the road when seen along the longitudinal cross - section of the road . a typical vertical alignment is composed of straight sections known as vertical tangents and parabolic curves , namely crest and sag curves .",
    "the design of vertical alignment is a crucial step in the road design problem since it has implications on road construction costs , traffic operations , vehicle fuel consumption , and safety @xcite . in vertical alignment optimization ,",
    "one fits a road profile to the ground profile while respecting various grade constraints and other road specifications .",
    "the objective is to minimize the cost of construction and the negative impacts on the environment @xcite .",
    "vertical alignment optimization models include linear programming @xcite , numerical search @xcite , state parametrization @xcite , dynamic programming @xcite , genetic algorithm @xcite , and mixed integer linear programming @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite for more references ) .",
    "a three - dimensional road alignment is the superimposition of two - dimensional horizontal and vertical alignments .",
    "in essence , road alignment design is a three - dimensional problem represented in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 coordinates .",
    "the development of models that fully optimize a three - dimensional road design problem is not yet successful , because there are many factors involved and complexities in the geometric specifications @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional road alignment optimization is presented as a constrained , nonlinear , and non - differentiable optimization problem @xcite .",
    "there are two basic approaches found in the literature : models that simultaneously optimize the horizontal and vertical alignments @xcite , and models that employ two or more stages of optimization @xcite .",
    "existing approaches for three - dimensional alignment optimization include genetic algorithms @xcite , swarm artificial intelligence @xcite , dynamic programming @xcite , neighbourhood search @xcite , and distance transform @xcite .",
    "dynamic programming and numerical search methods suffer from the high computational effort and large memory requirements @xcite .",
    "so far , all of these method focus only on minimizing the overall design cost , and omit the conflicting cost of road utility .",
    "this paper presents a novel bi - objective framework for optimizing a three - dimensional road alignment problem . in our model , a bi - objective cost function is formulated that consists of the ` earthwork cost ' and the ` utility cost ' .",
    "the cost associated with earthwork is the cost of ground cut , ground fill , waste material , and borrow material , all of which depend on the volume of the material .",
    "the utility cost is computed based on the length of the road .",
    "model constraints restrict maximum grade and radius of curvature for horizontal turns .    this paper advances research in horizontal alignment in several manners .",
    "first , this paper considers the three - dimensional alignment as a bi - objective problem .",
    "research in this direction has been limited , but shown great promise in application @xcite . indeed , aside from @xcite ( which all present different aspects of the same model ) , research in this direction appears absent .",
    "the principal difference in our model , as compared to @xcite , is expanded details on exactly how the road alignment is designed and costs are computed . as a result , our model also provides a detailed new surrogate model that can produce both an earthwork cost and a utility costs for a potential alignment .",
    "this is a very significant contribution to the field , as it makes future research in this area more accessible .",
    "we show that the model is computationally tractable , but retains many of the key aspects required to model earthwork and utility costs .",
    "finally , a case study is provided that demonstrates the pareto front of the bi - objective problem can be computed in reasonable time .",
    "this case study compares three different multiobjective optimization algorithms namely , the multiobjective genetic algorithm ( gamoo ) @xcite , the direct multisearch for multiobjective optimization ( dms ) @xcite , and the weighted sum method ( ws ) @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ modelvar ] ,",
    "the models for both horizontal and vertical alignments are presented .",
    "the cost functions are formulated in section [ surrcost ] .",
    "the bi - objective optimization model is provided in section [ mop ] .",
    "the numerical experiments performed and their results are reported in section [ numexp ] .",
    "finally , section [ colcln ] presents some concluding remarks .",
    "in our model , a horizontal alignment is composed of tangential segments and circular curves .",
    "the horizontal alignment geometry is required to satisfy two criteria : ( 1 ) the alignment should satisfy the orientation specified as @xmath3 , and ( 2 ) the first and the last sections of the alignment should be tangent segments .",
    "the circular curves are placed between two adjacent tangents to mitigate the sudden changes in the direction of the alignment , as is standard in road design .",
    "a typical geometry of horizontal alignment is depicted in figure [ fig11 ] .",
    "the geometric design of a horizontal alignment is described by a sequence of intersection points @xmath4 and the radius of a circular curve @xmath5 .",
    "there are three decision variables associated with each intersection point , namely @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 variables correspond to the @xmath10 and @xmath11coordinates of the intersection point , and @xmath5 is the radius of the circular curve .",
    "figure 1 here    let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be the start and end of the design road . we denote the horizontal component of @xmath14 and @xmath15 by @xmath16 and @xmath17 given the set of @xmath18 intersection points @xmath19 and the corresponding set of radius of curvature @xmath20 one can insert @xmath21 tangential road segments and @xmath18 circular curves to get the exact shape of a horizontal alignment ( see figure [ figg ] ) .",
    "next , we calculate the center @xmath22 of the curve and transition points @xmath23 and @xmath24 , as denoted in figure [ figg ] .",
    "denote the vector from @xmath25 to @xmath26 and @xmath25 to @xmath27 , respectively , by @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "define @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be the angle between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , then we calculate the coordinates of @xmath22 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 as follows .",
    "figure 2 here      given the intersection points @xmath36 and @xmath27 , and radius @xmath37 , see figure [ figg ] , then    @xmath38    where @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 be the distances from @xmath25 to @xmath34 .",
    "then @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the central angle of the circular arc , see figure [ figg ] .    using the identity @xmath43 we have @xmath44 note that the distance from @xmath25 to @xmath35 is equal to @xmath45    define vectors @xmath46 and @xmath47 as @xmath48 then @xmath49 thus",
    ", we obtain @xmath50      let @xmath51 be the midpoint of the line segment that connects @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "clearly @xmath51 lies on the line that passes through @xmath25 and @xmath22 .",
    "hence @xmath52 if @xmath53 is the distance from @xmath25 to the circle that is calculated as @xmath54 then @xmath55      the vertical alignment geometric design specifies the elevation of a point along a roadway . in our model",
    "it is composed of straight lines known as vertical tangents .",
    "we begin the model by stretching a surface orthogonal to the @xmath56plane along the horizontal alignment .",
    "the flattened surface is called the @xmath57plane , where @xmath58 is the distance measured along the horizontal alignment . the projection onto the @xmath57plane of the three - dimensional road alignment is the vertical alignment @xcite .",
    "a typical vertical alignment model is shown in figure [ visina8 ] .",
    "given the following sets of intersection points and the horizontal tangent points , calculated in section [ trans ] , @xmath59 we partition the horizontal tangent between @xmath60 into @xmath61 equally spaced points , and corresponding to these points we define a set of vertical points @xmath62 where @xmath63 , see figure [ fig321 ] .    figure 3 here    the mathematical details of the design road elevation @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 is given below .",
    "we require the elevation to be linear over circular road sections , which reduces the computation time .",
    "this assumption does not have significant effect on the precision of the solution since the length of the curved section is typically much smaller than the tangent section .",
    "define @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "then , for @xmath69    @xmath70    note that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are decision variables for the vertical alignment corresponding to @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    ". now we parametrize the vertical tangent between @xmath75 and @xmath76 using the parameter @xmath77 as follows . for @xmath69 ,",
    "the coordinates of any point @xmath78 on the line segment between @xmath75 and @xmath76 are calculated by    @xmath79    where @xmath80    figure 4 here    the horizontal distance between @xmath75 and @xmath76 , denoted @xmath81 , is calculated as @xmath82 the number of vertical alignment variables on each horizontal tangent section , except for the first and last horizontal tangents , is @xmath83 .",
    "the first and last horizontal tangent section each have @xmath84 and @xmath85 variables , respectively , because the start and the end of a road are not variables .",
    "suppose the number of intersection points is @xmath18 .",
    "then the number of vertical alignment variables is @xmath86      the geometric design of horizontal alignments and vertical alignments are constrained by code requirements and other limitations . in this section , the set of constraints for both alignments are discussed .",
    "let @xmath87 and let @xmath88 be real numbers .",
    "then the box constraint corresponding to @xmath25 is given by @xmath89 these constraints help reduce the search space for potential designs , and thereby allow for reasonable sized data sets ( see section [ surrcost ] . )      in our model , two adjacent circular curves portions of a road are allowed to meet , but never overlap .",
    "overlapping would result in a discontinuous road .",
    "this requirement can be written mathematically as follows @xmath90      given the minimum radius @xmath91 , the radius of curvature at each intersection point has to satisfy the minimal radius requirement @xmath92      given the maximum allowed vertical slope , @xmath93 , @xmath94      while not strictly necessary , it is reasonable to bound the road elevation . given the maximal vertical offset @xmath95 at the current ground elevation @xmath96 , @xmath97      in our model , we require the elevation to be linear over circular road sections .",
    "this simply means that the circular road sections are not split into multiple vertical sections .",
    "the surrogate cost model developed is based on the approximation of the ground surface by a series of continuous linear functions or planar surfaces . the horizontal plane in the region of interest",
    "is divided into grid cells of equal size , which are small enough that the terrain above the grid is approximated by a single linear function .",
    "a matrix format is employed to store important ground information for the region of interest .",
    "we denote the @xmath98 grid cell by @xmath99 , see figure [ fig2d ] . the terrain in each grid is then approximated by a linear function @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 and @xmath103 are matrices containing the ground elevation data .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the approximating plane elevation as the ground profile .",
    "we aim to calculate the cost of a road section ( tangential section or circular section ) , which is the sum of costs corresponding to each grid cell along the section .",
    "figure 5 here    in each section , two costs are developed : the earthwork costs and the utility cost .",
    "the cost associated with earthwork is the cost of ground cut , ground fill , and cost of borrow or waste material , all of which depend on the volume of the material .",
    "borrow and waste material is the difference between ground cut and ground fill .",
    "the calculation of the volume of ground cut and ground fill depends on the elevation difference between the approximating plane and the design road .",
    "the utility cost is computed based on the length of the road .    for the collection @xmath104 of tangential road sections and circular road sections ,",
    "we define @xmath105 as the total volume of ground cut on road section @xmath106 , and @xmath107 as the total volume of ground fill on road section @xmath106 .",
    "the overall volume of cut , denoted @xmath108 and volume of fill , denoted @xmath109 , is given as @xmath110 we then apply the costing parameters to calculate the total cost from earthwork @xmath111 and the total utility cost @xmath112 , @xmath113 where @xmath114 are parameters for cut and fill costs , @xmath115 is a single parameter representing the cost of either waste or borrow , @xmath116 is a utility cost parameter , and @xmath117 is the length of the road . note that waste and borrow costs are combined into a single cost , which represents the amount of unbalanced material in the road design . also note that @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 can be viewed as cost parameters in present day dollar ( the ` construction dollars ' ) .",
    "conversely , @xmath116 should be viewed as a parameter representing ` road effectiveness ' , so does not necessarily have a clear translation to present day dollars .    in the following sections , the calculation of cost models for tangent road section and circular road section are provided .",
    "suppose @xmath121 corresponds to a tangential road section that connects @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "the parametric equation of @xmath122 is given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 , and @xmath125 are given in [ param1,param2,param3 ] .",
    "the parametric equations of the design road profile and the ground profile in grid @xmath99 is calculated as @xmath126 and @xmath127 where @xmath128      we compute the parameter @xmath77 corresponding to the @xmath8 boundary cross and the @xmath9 boundary cross of grid cell @xmath99 . since it may be required to cut and fill the ground within a particular grid cell , we also calculate the parameter corresponding to the point of transition from cut to fill or fill to cut . these parameters are used to calculate the design road elevation in and the ground elevation in .",
    "we define the sets of parameters @xmath129 for the @xmath8-boundary cross , @xmath9-boundary cross , and for the transition point .",
    "let @xmath130 and @xmath131 be the @xmath8 and @xmath9 boundary points at which the horizontal tangent crosses the grid cell @xmath132 see figure [ fig2d ] .",
    "then , for @xmath133 the parameter @xmath77 corresponding to the boundary point is given as @xmath134 similarly , if there exists a transition from cut to fill ( or fill to cut ) within @xmath99 , the transition set is calculated by @xmath135    define the union of the sets of parameters as @xmath136 let @xmath137 be the cardinality of @xmath138 .",
    "we sort @xmath138 in an increasing order to create @xmath139 as @xmath140      given the vertical points @xmath63 and @xmath141 , where @xmath142 , and @xmath143 are calculated using [ vpts2,vpts4 ] .",
    "the length of @xmath144 , denoted @xmath145 , is calculated by @xmath146 the length of a tangential road segment is computed as @xmath147      if the parameters @xmath148 bracket a cut region , then the approximate volume of ground cut for the tangential road segment over @xmath149 $ ] is obtained by integrating the cross - section area .",
    "the elevation difference between the design road and the ground at @xmath150 $ ] is given by @xmath151    we assume that the ground cut has a trapezoidal cross - section , see figure [ fig24 ] .",
    "figure 6 here    the cross - sectional area of the trapezoid is calculated by @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the width of the road , @xmath154 and @xmath155 are side slope angles , and @xmath156 .",
    "typically , for the model , we fix the values of @xmath154 and @xmath155 for all road segments ; however , these values can change from segment to segment if desired .",
    "in fact , these values can be based on the particular grid cell ( @xmath157 ) through which the road travels . as such",
    ", local soil conditions can be incorporated into the model if desired .",
    "the approximate volume of ground cut over @xmath149 $ ] is calculated as @xmath158 where @xmath159    assuming @xmath160 and @xmath161 bracket a cut , the cross - section area @xmath162 is given by @xmath163 where @xmath164 if @xmath160 , @xmath165 do not bracket a cut , then @xmath162 is defined as @xmath166 .",
    "we have @xmath148 , so we can calculate @xmath167 is simply a line connecting @xmath168 and @xmath169 over @xmath149 $ ] .",
    "hence , if @xmath170 brackets a cut segment , integrating using we get @xmath171 therefore , the volume of ground cut is computed as @xmath172      suppose the parameters @xmath160 and @xmath165 bracket a fill region .",
    "the elevation difference between the design road and the ground at @xmath150 $ ] is given as @xmath173 we also assume that , the ground fill has trapezoidal cross - section , see figure [ fig25 ] . if @xmath160 and @xmath165 bracket fill , then the area of fill volume , @xmath174 , is given as @xmath175 where @xmath176 if @xmath160 and @xmath165 do not bracket fill , then @xmath174 is calculated as zero .",
    "therefore , the volume of ground fill is calculated as @xmath177    figure 7 here      suppose segment @xmath121 corresponds to a circular road section , that is , a circle of radius @xmath37 and centre @xmath178 that connects @xmath34 and @xmath35 , see figure [ fig27 ] .",
    "the parametric equation of @xmath122 is given as @xmath179 where , @xmath180    similar to tangent segments , we begin by creating the parameter collection representing when the segment crosses an x or y boundary , or changes from a cut to fill ; @xmath181 we then order them to create @xmath182    figure 8 here      the length of the circular road section , denoted by @xmath183 is given by @xmath184 where @xmath185 is measured in radians .",
    "if @xmath186 bracket a cut region , then @xmath187 where , @xmath188 to calculate the jacobian , @xmath189 , we use @xmath190 where @xmath191 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath192    the volume of ground cut is , therefore , calculated as    @xmath193    the closed - form solution for @xmath194 can easily be calculated symbolically however , it requires almost full page to write .",
    "we therefore withhold it from this paper .",
    "if the parameters @xmath160 and @xmath165 bracket a fill region , the elevation difference at @xmath150 $ ] is calculated as @xmath195 and the cross - sectional area @xmath196 is given by @xmath197 thus , the volume of ground fill is computed as    @xmath198      the model described above makes several simplifying assumptions with regards to the road design costs .",
    "we list some of these now , and mention that future research should explore the implications of these simplifying assumptions . up front",
    ", it should be clear that many road design costs are missing from the surrogate .",
    "earthwork cost is simplified to only include cut , fill , and borrow / waste costs .",
    "transportation costs are omitted , as are specific road design costs such as retaining walls and bridge work .",
    "utility cost is simplified even further , as it is represented using only the length of the road . while many aspects of utility cost ( such as paving , maintenance , speed - limits and travel time ) are primarily affected by the length of the road",
    ", other factors can also affect these costs .",
    "for example , maximum grade and road curvature can affect speed limits and travel time .",
    "like any real - world problem , these simplifications are made in order to create a computational tractable model .",
    "some more subtle simplifying assumptions are also present in the model . for example ,",
    "waste and borrow costs are combined into a single cost , @xmath120 , which represents the amount of unbalanced material in the road design , @xmath199 . in some situations one of the waste or borrow cost maybe significantly higher than the other . in this case , the model could separate waste and borrow into two parameters by changing the first objective function to include @xmath200 instead of @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is the borrow cost and @xmath120 is the waste cost .",
    "another simplification made is the assumption that the earth shrinkage and earth swell factors are reciprocal .",
    "that is , overall no earth is lost or gained during the construction process . in practice this is not always the case , and indeed will generally only be true if the optimized cut and fill quantities were exactly equal . if one desired to incorporate shrinkage and swell factors into the model , it can be easily accomplished by multiplying the total cut and fill volume calculated above by an appropriate factor : @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the shrinkage parameter .",
    "another simplification is the model assumes side slopes are equal at all points in the road .",
    "essentially this assumes that the ground material is of a similar composition at all point in the terrain . to remove this assumption ,",
    "the parameters @xmath205 and @xmath206 could be individually selected for each road segment .",
    "mathematically this will not change the model structure , or the computation of the integral , but in terms of implementation this would greatly complicate the code .",
    "the model also omits transition curves from the road design , while past researchers have included transition curves @xcite .",
    "while similar approaches could be used to model transition curves , the model would require significant changes to accommodate them .    also , when computing the cost of a road segment , the model computes the cost as if the center line of the road and the center line of the terrain is representative of the height of the road above ( below ) the terrain at the boundaries of the road . if the terrain is sloped acutely with respect to the road , then it is possible that the terrain on one boundary of the road is above the road , while the terrain on the other boundary of the road is below the road .",
    "this would cause computational errors . however , unless the road is particularly wide , the resulting error seems unlikely to be large .",
    "finally , the model ignores any technical design standards regarding interrelations between horizontal and vertical alignments .",
    "this is a standard approach in road design literature , as it is assumed that an engineer will make final edits on any design .",
    "multiobjective optimization ( moo ) ( also called multicriteria optimization , or vector optimization ) can be defined as the problem of finding a vector of decision variables which satisfies constraints and optimizes a vector of objective functions @xcite .",
    "bi - objective optimization refers to the specific case where the vector contains exactly two objective functions .",
    "there is , usually , no unique solution that is simultaneously optimal for all objectives @xcite . as a result",
    ", one can only consider a trade - off among the objectives , and the primary goal of multiobjective optimization is to seek for the best trade - off to support the decision maker in choosing a final preferred solution .",
    "although there is no universally accepted solution concept for decision problems with multiple objectives , one would agree that a good solution must not be dominated by the other feasible alternatives @xcite .",
    "the set of nondominated points is know as the _ pareto optimal _ set .",
    "engineering design problems are often multiobjective , requiring trade - offs @xcite . in the literature , a great deal of theoretical , methodological , and applied studies have been undertaken in the area of multiobjective optimization @xcite .",
    "the need for moo in road design has been recognized @xcite . during the road alignment design process",
    ", an engineer can have different objectives that need to be achieved .",
    "some of the objectives may favour the shortest road possible , while others might favour an indirect and longer route with smaller earthwork cost .",
    "the surrogate cost model developed in section [ surrcost ] has two components , the cost due to the volume of earthwork and the cost related to the length of the road .",
    "there is , usually , a conflict between the two cost components .",
    "we model the 3d road alignment optimization problem as a bi - objective optimization problem subject to the constraints listed in section [ const ] .",
    "the objectives are the utility cost @xmath207 and the earthwork cost @xmath208 .",
    "thus , the solution of the optimization problem should reflect the trade - off between the length of the road and the volume of earthwork .",
    "the costs are formulated as functions of decision variables .",
    "let @xmath209 and @xmath210 be the coordinates of the intersection points , @xmath211 be the vector of radius of curvature , and @xmath212 be the vector of elevations of the design road .",
    "the input parameters of our model are : @xmath213 @xmath13 , and the maximal vertical offset @xmath95 from the current ground elevations @xmath96 .",
    "the design parameters are the maximum allowable gradient @xmath214 , and the minimum radius of curvature @xmath215 .",
    "thus , the simultaneous optimization of horizontal and vertical alignments is given as follows .",
    "in this section , we examine a case study applying the proposed model to design an approximately 1 km section of road over an actual ground profile in california covering an area of 500 by 1000 meters . the 3d view and contour map of the terrain",
    "are displayed in figure [ fig30 ] and figure [ fig31 ] , respectively . as is typical in road design , the @xmath217 axis ( road elevation )",
    "is measured in meters , while the @xmath218 axes ( horizontal location ) are measured in decameters .",
    "an initial alignment that satisfies all constraint sets is generated based on the ground profile of the study area .",
    "the input values and design / model parameters are provided by our industrial partner , softree technical system inc .",
    "( http://www.softree.com [ http://www.softree.com ] ) and based on approximate values for constructing a forest service road .",
    "( typical forest service roads cost between @xmath219 and @xmath220 per km . )",
    "cost details are presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "figure 9 here    figure 10 here    .input variables and design / model parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure 14 here    in examining figure [ fig38 ] , note that the earthwork cost ranges from @xmath221 to @xmath222 , while the utility cost only ranges from @xmath223 to @xmath224 .",
    "this should not be taken to mean that earthwork costs are more than utility costs .",
    "as mentioned before , earthwork costs can be viewed as present day dollar ( the ` construction dollars ' ) ; but utility costs should be viewed as a value representing long term road effectiveness , so does not necessarily have a clear translation to present day dollars .",
    "what is clear in figure [ fig38 ] is that the high end of the earthwork costs shows very little improvement in utility costs . as such , in figure  [ fig : zoomed all in one ] we present a cropped view of the pareto front , focusing on earthwork costs of @xmath225 to @xmath226 .",
    "figure 15 here    the ` starred ' point in figures  [ fig38 ] and [ fig : zoomed all in one ] was found using dms and corresponds to a utility cost of @xmath227 and an earthwork cost of @xmath228 . based on the numerical results obtained , we see the dms performs better than others in terms of the magnitude of objective functions when the function call is set to about 51,000 .",
    "while moga provides a large spread in the pareto front , all of the points found are pareto dominated by the starred point .",
    "working from figure  [ fig : zoomed all in one ] , we conclude that , in this case study , there are a relatively small number of roads that require further investigation when selecting a final road design . in figure",
    "[ fig : sampleroad ] , we present the horizontal alignment for the road corresponding to the starred point in figures [ fig38 ] and [ fig : zoomed all in one ] .",
    "figure 16 here",
    "in this study , a model was developed to solve a 3-dimensional road alignment optimization problem .",
    "the model uses bi - objective optimization to minimize the earthwork and utility costs .",
    "cost penalty parameters are introduced and their values ( that we obtain from our industry partner ) are fixed , but , in theory , they can be computed in order to calibrate the solution of the model .",
    "the cost items are classified into those that depend on the length of the road and those that depend on the volume of the earthwork .",
    "these are , often , conflicting with each other because , during the optimization process , the utility cost prefers the shortest route between the two end points , while the earthwork cost chooses a route with minimum amount of earthwork .    as a major contribution to the field of three - dimensional alignment",
    ", the paper provides a high level of detail on exactly how the cost computations are preformed .",
    "the model makes a number of simplifying assumptions , discussed in detail in section [ ] .",
    "it is our hope that the detailed cost computations outlined will allow for improved accessiblity for future research to explore the impact of these assumptions and remove them when deemed necessary .",
    "a case study based on actual terrain was examined .",
    "three different optimization algorithms ( moga , dms , and ws ) were used to solve the bi - objective optimization problem . in this case study , dms provided the best pareto front for this model .",
    "more importantly , both moga and dms were capable of providing a good quality pareto front within a reasonable time limit .",
    "further research is needed to check whether moga and dms are consistent in this regard .",
    "it should be noted that moga , dms , and ws were chosen due to availability of software , and therefore are not necessarily the best solvers for this problem .",
    "other researchers have explored creating custom solvers for road design optimization ( @xcite among others ) .",
    "future work will progress in this direction .",
