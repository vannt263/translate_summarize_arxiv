    "the muon magnetic moment is related to the spin by the expression @xmath7 where the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath8 is predicted theoretically ( see e.g. ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] ) to be exactly 2 .",
    "however , interactions existing in nature modify @xmath8 to be slightly exceeding value 2 because of the emission and absorption of virtual photons , intermediate vector and higgs bosons and vacuum polarization into virtual hadronic states .    in order to describe this modification of @xmath8 theoretically",
    ", the magnetic anomaly was introduced by the relation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath11 is very interesting object for theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "it is the best measured quantity in physics [ @xcite],[@xcite ] @xmath12 on the other hand , an accurate theoretical ( better phenomenological ) evaluation of @xmath13 provides an extremely clean test of `` electroweak theory '' and any disagreement between @xmath13 and @xmath14 may give the first window to new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "so , just the latter pretends the evaluation of @xmath13 to be as precise as possible , in order to be sure that sm is taken into account with sufficiently high precision .    nowadays the weak interaction contributions , arising from single and two - loop diagrams , are [ @xcite]-[@xcite ] @xmath15 the qed contributions up to 8-th order give the value [ @xcite ] @xmath16    though t. kinoshita recently revealed in his calculations a program error [ @xcite ] , the correction is not large enough to affect the comparison between theory and experiment for the muon @xmath1 , but it only does alter the inferred value for the fine structure constant .",
    "the strong interactions contribute through the feynman diagrams presented in figs.1 - 2 .            the lowest - order hadronic vacuum - polarization contributions ( fig.1 ) , according to the more recent evaluations ( considering only @xmath17 annihilation cross - sections as there is still unsolved problem of disagreement [ @xcite ] with @xmath18-decay data ) @xmath19 } }   \\label{z6 }",

    "the most discussed from all hadronic contributions were the light  by ",

    "8,9 ) and subsequently the contributions of @xmath105 processes to @xmath13 are evaluated @xmath106 , @xmath107 , by means of the first integral in ( [ z17]).the latter clearly indicate that values of coupling constants in table 1 are overestimated . this our hypothesis",
    "is confirmed in the case of @xmath108 by rekalo and tomasi - gustafsson [ @xcite ] , who found the latter to be 10-times smaller than in table 1 .    if we take in the lump all averaged values @xmath109 of vector - meson scalar - meson photon coupling constants from table 1 10-times smaller , one obtaines the behaviours of @xmath110 and @xmath111 with smooth fall in the space - like region ( see full lines in figs .",
