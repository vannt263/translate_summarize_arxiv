    "in the now standard model of concordance cosmology , large - scale structure grows through simple gravitational aggregation and collapse from the initial fluctuations in the mass density of the early universe . in this framework , galaxies form as baryonic gas cools at the center of dark matter halos and subsequently grow through accretion and mergers , leading to the hierarchical build - up of galaxy mass .",
    "increasingly deep and wide - area multiwavelength surveys in the past decade have established a fairly robust outline of the global evolution of galaxies over nearly 90% of the age of the universe .",

    "the details of _ how _ galaxies were assembled and evolved remain , however , poorly known .",
    "much of our current knowledge at @xmath18 still relies heavily on galaxy - integrated spectral energy distributions and colours , and on global properties such as stellar mass and age , star formation rate , interstellar extinction , and sizes .",
    "studies based on integrated spectroscopy ( mostly in the optical , much fewer in the infrared and submillimeter ) are still comparatively scarce but have provided secure redshifts for various photometrically - selected samples , and first results notably on galactic - scale outflows , dynamical masses , gas mass fractions , and nebular abundances .",
    "more direct and detailed constraints are however needed to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies , involving angular momentum exchange and loss , cooling , dissipation , dynamical processes , and feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "such constraints are crucial as input and benchmarks for theories and simulations of galaxy formation and evolution",
    ".    of particular relevance in this context is the issue of the dominant mechanisms by which massive galaxies at high redshift assemble their baryonic mass , and what processes drive their star formation activity and early evolution . while major merging is undoubtedly taking place at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , new observational results suggest that rapid but more continuous gas accretion via `` cold flows '' and/or minor mergers likely played an important role in driving star formation and mass growth of the massive star - forming galaxy population at @xmath18 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this emphasizes the crucial role of spatially- and spectrally - resolved investigations of individual galaxies at early stages of their evolution .",
    "such studies enable the mapping of kinematics and morphologies , and of the distribution of star formation , gas and stars , and physical properties such as chemical abundances and excitation state of the gas .",

    "accurate redshifts for the targets was mandatory to ensure that the emission lines of interest fall within the near - ir atmospheric windows and between the strong night sky lines .",
    "the density ( per wavelength unit ) , intensities , and rapid time variability of the sky lines make emission line redshift determinations in the near - ir fairly inefficient , even at the spectral resolution of @xmath43 of sinfoni .    since we were primarily concerned with the ionized gas kinematics and morphologies as tracers of the dynamical and evolutionary state of the systems , and with their star formation properties , we generally tried to avoid known agn galaxies , although a small number was included . in total , six sins galaxies ( representing 10% of the detected sources ) were previously known or suspected agn from existing optical and/or near - ir spectroscopy , and x - ray emission or mips @xmath44 observations when available .",

    "the following subsections describe in more detail the selection of galaxies of each class and survey , and the additional considerations that were in some cases explicitly applied . in brief , these include : emission line width and indications of velocity structure or lack thereof ( for part of the @xmath45 optically - selected targets with prior near - ir long - slit spectroscopy ) , @xmath46 and @xmath47 colours ( satisfying the `` @xmath37 '' criterion of @xcite , for eleven targets or @xmath48 of the full sample ) , and rest - frame uv and/or optical morphologies ( encompassing irregular , multi - component , disky , and compact morphologies , for 23 targets or @xmath49 of the full sample ) .",

    "* ) . moreover , our requirement of minimum h@xmath0 flux and our sensitivity limits are likely to translate into an overall bias towards younger and more actively star - forming systems .    to place our sins galaxies in context , we compared their distributions of redshift , photometric , and stellar properties with those of a purely @xmath6-selected sample in the same @xmath2 interval .",
    "we chose this reference sample from the cdfs , one of the best - studied deep survey fields with extensive multiwavelength coverage , and used the broad - band seds and redshifts from the publicly available @xmath6-band limited fireworks catalogue of @xcite .",

    "we did not apply any other criterion , so as to have a reference sample that is as representative as possible of the bulk of @xmath19 galaxy populations .",
    "in particular , we did not prune based on star - forming activity , and this is reflected by the presence of massive objects with low absolute and specific star formation rates .",

    ", we used the stellar evolutionary code from @xcite , and the free parameters were the age , extinction , and luminosity scaling of the model synthetic sed .",
    "we adopted the @xcite imf and the reddening curve of @xcite , and assumed a solar metallicity .",

    "the part of the @xmath19 population that is most clearly absent among the sins sample is the massive quiescent tail at low absolute / specific star formation rates ; such objects would be difficult to detect as no or very faint h@xmath0 is expected , at least from star formation .",
    "figure  [ fig - sedprop ] also indicates that lower mass objects are underrepresented compared to a pure @xmath6-selected sample in the same redshift range .",

    "a large fraction of the low - mass objects in the cdfs sample lie at the faint end of the magnitude range ( in both observed @xmath6 and rest - frame @xmath195 band ) and are at the lowest redshifts in the interval considered here ( i.e. around @xmath229 ) ; restricting the comparison to @xmath230 reduces ( but does not eliminate ) the differences at low masses .    detected and undetected sources in our sins h@xmath0 sample are distinguished in figures  [ fig - samples ] , [ fig - kz ] , [ fig - magcol ] , and [ fig - sedprop ] .",
    "there is no obvious trend with redshift for the undetected galaxies , as may be expected from our night sky line avoidance and minimum expected h@xmath0 flux criteria when choosing our targets .",
    "non - detections also do not differentiate in any of the photometric and stellar properties considered here . for the @xmath227 colours , we restricted the comparison to near-/mid - ir - selected targets only ( to which all non - detections belong ) because these have consistent photometry in similar @xmath205 bandpasses while for the optically - selected bx / bm  targets ( 30% of the detections ) , we approximated the @xmath205 band magnitudes with the @xmath204 band photometry and this may bias the comparison . in all properties as well as in redshift ,",

    "we conclude from this section that in spite of the diversity in selection criteria ( from the parent surveys / catalogues and the additional specific criteria considered in choosing our targets ) , the sins h@xmath0 sample provides a reasonable representation of massive actively star - forming galaxies with @xmath4 at @xmath19 in the following sense .",

    "the data were taken in series of `` ab '' cycles , with typical nod throws of about half the sinfoni fov so as to image the source in all frames , and jitter box widths of about one - tenth the fov to minimize the number of redundant positions on the detector array .",
    "a typical `` observing block '' ( ob ) consisted of six such dithered on - source exposures .",
    "for the `` offsets - to - sky '' scheme , the telescope pointing was alternated between the object ( `` o '' ) and adjacent sky regions ( `` s '' ) empty of sources usually in an `` o - s - o - o - s - o '' pattern for each ob .",
    "the pointing on the object and sky positions was varied by about one - tenth of the fov , thus ensuring adequate independent sampling of the sky signal subtracted from each of two object frames sharing the same sky frame .",
    "the individual exposure times varied between 300s , 600s , and 900s depending mainly on the variability and intensity of the background and night sky line emission , in order to optimize the background subtraction and remain in the background - limited regime in the wavelength regions around the lines of interest .",
    "the total on - source integration times range from 20 m to 10hr , with an average of 3.4hr spent per band and pixel scale for each target .",
    "the total integration times were driven by the surface brightness of the sources and by our aim of mapping the line emission and kinematics out to large radii .",
    "in general , if a new target was not detected after @xmath242 , we did not observe it further .",
    "therefore , the non - detections among our sins sample may have line emission but fainter than the relatively shallow sensitivity limits of these data sets .",
    "also , for a few targets with the shortest integration times , more observations were not obtained because of various factors including weather conditions , observing run duration , and target priorities .",
    "the consequences on the distributions of h@xmath0 properties of these observational strategies and constraints are investigated in   [ sect - ha_prop ] .",
    "exposures of the acquisition stars used for blind offsetting to the galaxies were taken to monitor the seeing and the positional accuracy ( generally one `` o - s - o '' set per science ob ) . for flux calibration and atmospheric transmission correction , we observed late - b , early - a , and g1v to g3v stars with near - ir magnitudes in the range @xmath243 .",
    "these telluric standards data were taken every night , as close in time and airmass as possible to each target observed during the night .",
    "acquisition stars and telluric standards were always observed with the same instrument setup as for science objects ( band and pixel scale ) .",
    "we reduced the data using the software package _ spred _ developed specifically for spiffi @xcite , complemented with additional custom routines to optimize the reduction for faint high redshift targets .",
    "the data reduction is analogous to standard procedures applied for near - ir long - slit spectroscopy but with additional processing to reconstruct the three - dimensional ( 3d ) data cube .",
    "the main reduction steps applied to each science target for a given instrument band and pixel scale setup were as follows .",
    "the night sky line and background emission as well as the dark current were first removed from the science data .",
    "this was done by subtracting ( without shifting ) the raw science frames pairwise for data sets taken with the `` on - source dithering '' pattern , or subtracting the sky frame from its adjacent object frames for those obtained with the `` offsets - to - sky '' sequence .",
    "the data were then flatfielded with exposures of a halogen calibration lamp .",
    "bad pixels identified from the dark and flat - field frames were corrected for in the science data by interpolation , completing the pre - processing stage .",
    "arc lamp frames were used to generate the `` wavemap , '' and to trace the edges and curvature of the slitlets .",
    "the arc lamp frames were reconstructed to data cubes to verify the 3d reconstruction parameters .",
    "the pre - processed science data frames were then reconstructed into cubes , corrected for distortion , and flux - calibrated and transmission - corrected as described below .",
    "all science cubes within a given ob were spatially aligned according to the dither offsets sequence used for the observations .",
    "our high redshift targets were always too faint to allow the determination of spatial shifts from centroiding or cross - correlating of single exposures . however , the small offsets applied within an ob for dithering or offsets - to - sky are very accurate at the vlt , as they are performed relative to the telescope active optics guide star . we verified this whenever possible by comparing the morphology of the targets between individual combined obs ( i.e. , averaging the aligned exposures within an ob ) . the relative offsets between different obs ( often taken on different nights )",
    "were determined based on the measured position of the acquisition star observed for each ob and the known offsets applied to go on target , from the centroid position of the sources in the individual combined obs when sufficiently bright , or from the relative offsets between obs for those that were taken successively without re - acquisition in between .",
    "all aligned , flux- and transmission - calibrated science cubes of a given target were finally combined together by averaging with sigma - clipping ( i.e. , iteratively removing data points deviating from the mean , typically clipping at the @xmath244 level ) .",
    "this step also generated a `` sigma - cube , '' recording the standard deviation of the values for a given pixel in the 3d data cube across all cubes combined .",
    "the reduced data often showed very large residuals from the strong night sky lines because our individual exposure times of @xmath245 are comparable or longer than the variability timescales of the sky lines .",
    "moreover , due to effects of instrumental flexure while tracking the targets , the exact wavelength calibration for individual science exposures can deviate from the master wavemap based on the arc lamp data by up to @xmath246 of a pixel or more along the dispersion axis , leading to asymmetric residual profiles . to reduce these residuals , the wavelength calibration and sky subtraction steps were repeated with optimization following the method described by @xcite . in brief , the wavelength calibration of the individual exposures was refined using the positions of the night sky lines in the raw frames ( before sky subtraction ) .",
    "this ensured that all science frames were interpolated to a common wavelength grid , with an accuracy better than @xmath247 of a pixel .",
    "a more sophisticated sky subtraction procedure was applied next , which involves scaling each transition group of telluric oh lines separately in order to further reduce the residuals around the emission lines of interest for a given source .",
    "the data of the telluric standard stars and the acquisition stars were reduced in a similar way as the science data .",
    "flux calibration was performed on a night - by - night basis using the broad - band magnitudes of the telluric standards .",
    "correction for atmospheric transmission was done by dividing the science cubes by the integrated spectrum of the telluric standard .",
    "broad - band images of the acquisition stars were created by averaging together all wavelength channels of the reduced cubes , with @xmath248-clipping to exclude the strongest residuals from night sky lines .",
    "the resulting angular resolution for a given target in a given instrument setup was determined on the combined image obtained from the acquisition star s data associated with all of the target s obs , providing the effective spatial psf of the data sets . for both no - ao and ao - assisted data , and for the purpose of characterizing the angular resolution of the data ,",
    "the effective psf shape is well approximated by a gaussian . in appendix",
    "[ app - psfs ] , we investigate in more detail the psf characteristics and quantify the ( small ) impact of uncertainties on the extraction and modeling of kinematics maps . table  [ tab - obs ] lists the fwhms of the best - fit two - dimensional gaussian profiles to the effective psfs .",
    "figure  [ fig - psfdet ] shows the distribution of the h@xmath0 data sets as a function of their psf fwhm for all objects observed and for the detected ones .",
    "since the psf calibrations were not obtained simultaneously with the science data ( and , for ao - assisted observations , were taken on - axis ) , these values represent approximately the effective angular resolution of the data sets .",
    "inspection of the individual images of the stars interleaved between the science obs indicate typical variations in psf fwhm of @xmath249 for obs of a given galaxy , but these variations do not significantly affect the results ( as we show in appendix  [ app - psfs ] ) .",
    "the data reduction affects the resulting spectral resolution . to determine the effective resolution at the reconstructed data cube level , we applied a similar reduction procedure but without sky subtraction and spatial registration , thus creating `` sky '' data cubes .",
    "we extracted the night sky spectrum by integrating over a square aperture of @xmath250 pixels on a side ( the results are little sensitive to the size of the region ) .",
    "the line shape of unblended sky lines is well approximated by a gaussian profile , and the fwhm in wavelength units is constant across each band .",
    "for the instrument setups relevant to the h@xmath0 line measurements discussed in this paper , the effective fwhm spectral resolution corresponds to @xmath251 and @xmath252 in @xmath6 and @xmath65 at the @xmath234 scale , and @xmath253 in @xmath6 at the @xmath236 scale .",
    "this section describes the method applied to extract the emission line properties , including fluxes , kinematics , and sizes .",

    "we extracted maps of the velocity - integrated line fluxes , relative velocities , and velocity dispersion from the reduced data cubes using line profile fitting .",
    "we employed the code _ linefit _ developed by our group specifically for sinfoni applications @xcite .",
    "it is an evolved version of the procedure applied in our previously published work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the key ( and new ) features of _ linefit _ include the following : _ ( i ) _ the spectral resolution is implicitely taken into account by convolving the assumed intrinsic emission line profile and a template line shape for the effective instrumental resolution before performing the fits , _ ( ii ) _ weighted fits are performed according to three possible schemes based on an input noise cube : uniform ( effectively no weighting ) , gaussian , or poisson weighting , and _ ( iii ) _ formal fitting uncertainties are computed from 100 monte carlo simulations , where the points of the input spectrum at each spatial pixel are perturbed assuming gaussian noise properties characterized by the rms from the input noise cube .",
    "the weighted fits lead to more robust measurements of the line fluxes , central wavelengths , and widths for our near - ir spectroscopic data where the noise level varies strongly as a function of wavelength ( due to the increased noise level at wavelengths of strong night sky lines ) .",
    "the complex noise properties complicate analytic error propagation to compute measurements uncertainties . after experimentation",
    ", we found than an empirical approach based on monte carlo simulations leads to realistic estimates of the formal uncertainties on all fitted parameters .",
    "the underlying assumption is that while the noise behaviour is not gaussian across wavelengths and as a function of aperture size , it is for a given wavelength channel and a given aperture size .",
    "we verified this in our data sets from an analysis of the the pixel - to - pixel rms and of the distribution of counts measured in non - overlapping apertures randomly placed in regions empty of source emission in the reduced data cubes .",
    "these distributions are indeed well described by gaussian functions for a given aperture size and spectral channel .",
    "this analysis provides the average pixel - to - pixel rms noise at each wavelength over the effective field of view ( the region of overlap of all science exposures for a target ) and the appropriate scaling as a function of aperture size ( most relevant for the integrated spectra and axis profiles extracted in   [ sub - extrspec ] and [ sub - profiles ] ) , which we used as input noise spectrum in the line fitting .",
    "the details of the noise analysis are given in appendix ",
    "[ app - noise ] .    before fitting , we median - filtered the data cubes to slightly increase the s / n ratio with a 2  pixel - wide filter along each of the three axes or , for some of the most diffuse and extended sources , with a 3  pixel - wide filter spatially ( e.g. , @xmath83 ) . in the fitting procedure",
    ", we always assumed a single gaussian line profile , which we found to be appropriate on a pixel - to - pixel basis for our galaxies . with this assumption ,",
    "our fits are sensitive to the dominant emission line component and , in particular , are negligibly influenced by a possible faint broad underlying component ( either intrinsic to the galaxies or due , for instance , to beam - smearing at larger radii of a central high velocity dispersion source ) .",
    "to account for instrumental spectral resolution , we used the average of unblended night sky line profiles for the corresponding band and pixel scale that was determined empirically from the `` sky '' data cubes ( see   [ sub - datared ] ) .",
    "after initial sigma - clipping rejection of the strongest outliers , we applied gaussian weighting @xmath254 in the line fitting procedure using the associated noise cube .",
    "pixels with formal @xmath255 on their velocity - integrated line flux or with obvious bad fits were masked out in the output velocity and velocity dispersion maps .    in performing",
    "the line fits , a continuum component was subtracted .",
    "this component was determined as the best - fit first - order polynomial through adjacent spectral intervals free from possible line emission from the galaxies and from residuals ( @xmath256 ) from night sky lines .",
    "this generally leads to rather noisy continuum maps for the fainter continuum sources , because of the limited wavelength range used for the linear fit to the continuum , although the line fluxes are not significantly affected in those cases . in order to obtain more robust continuum maps , or",
    "at least detect the region(s ) of peak continuum emission , we took advantage of the full band coverage of sinfoni and computed the continuum from an iterative procedure , where we averaged the data spectrally excluding channels corresponding to strong night sky lines and those including line emission from the galaxies .",
    "the iterations consisted of varying the threshold applied to exclude spectral channels based on the noise cube , so as to optimize for s / n ratio of the resulting continuum map .    for the detected galaxies of our sins h@xmath0 sample ,",
    "the effective angular resolution of the h@xmath0 maps obtained from seeing - limited observations is typically @xmath257 ( median value ) and ranges from @xmath258 to @xmath259 ( from the near - ir seeing fwhm and accounting for the spatial median filtering applied when extracting the maps ) .",
    "this corresponds to typically @xmath260 and a range of @xmath261 at the respective redshift of the sources .",
    "for the objects observed with ao at the @xmath234 scale , the resulting resolution is @xmath262 and , after median filtering , @xmath263 or @xmath264 . for the ao - assisted data sets at the @xmath236 scale , the resolution is about three times better than for the seeing - limited data : @xmath265 and , after smoothing , @xmath266 or @xmath267 .",
    "we measured for each galaxy the global emission line properties from spatially - integrated spectra from the unsmoothed reduced data cubes .",
    "the spectra were integrated in circular apertures centered on the centroid of the line emission as determined from the line maps .",
    "significant noise levels , especially towards the noisier edges of the effective field of view and for the fainter sources , complicated the definition of more optimum integration regions such as isophotal apertures .",

    "consequently , median values and ranges in the integrated h@xmath0 properties of our sins sample change very little when excluding the four known agn .    with the full 2d mapping of the line emission and kinematics of our sinfoni data",
    ", we can examine in more detail the possible agn contribution to the global h@xmath0 properties , as measured from the dominant narrow component to which our line extraction procedure is sensitive (   [ sub - extrspec ] ; see also @xcite for a discussion of the presence of broad underlying h@xmath0 emission ) . for @xmath273 ,",

    "taken at face value , this would imply that the most intense ( unobscured ) star formation activity takes place in the larger and more massive systems , and that the integrated h@xmath0 velocity dispersion is related to galaxy stellar mass despite varying contributions by large - scale velocity gradients , non - circular motions , and intrinsic gas turbulence ( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is important to assess carefully the impact of our detection limits and observational strategy on the apparent trends .    to evaluate our sensitivity limits in terms of size",
    ", we did the following simulations based on the real sinfoni data .",
    "we first determined the average s / n per spatial resolution element for each galaxy and calculated the necessary increase in half - light radius for the s / n to drop below @xmath336 , keeping the other properties constant ( total h@xmath0 flux and integrated line width ) .",

    "the line of sensitivity limit of the data lies about @xmath341 above the locus of data points , or a factor of 4 ; this is also the average ratio of @xmath342 of the individual galaxies .",
    "the immediate implication is that the h@xmath0 sizes we measured are little affected by the sensitivity of our data sets .",
    "however , as already mentioned , when observing we followed the strategy that if a source was not detected within @xmath343 irrespective of actual morphology , we did not reobserve it .",
    "this is a potential concern for interpreting possible trends , as it means that we may have missed the more extended and/or diffuse sources for a given flux . to mimic this effect in our simulations , we re - did the same calculations but this time normalizing the s / n per resolution element for each source to a common integration time of 1hr ( this is a rather conservative estimate as in some cases we observed up to 2.5hr before abandoning sources that were not detected ) .",
    "the running median of the resulting @xmath344 versus @xmath319 follows a line nearly parallel to that for @xmath337 but is offset by @xmath345 towards smaller sizes and corresponds roughly to the upper envelope of the data points ( solid line in figure  [ fig - hasigmarha]_b _ ) .",
    "this suggests that the apparent trend possibly results partly from our observational strategy .",
    "the standard deviation of the individual @xmath344 about the running median line is @xmath340 , similar to that for @xmath337 .",
    "this indicates that the scatter in limiting size estimates reflects the different sensitivities in different wavelength regions more than the different integration times among the sources .",
    "we evaluated our sensitivity limits in terms of velocity dispersion in a similar manner , increasing the intrinsic velocity dispersion while keeping the total h@xmath0 line flux and half - light radius constant .",

    "this analysis indicates that our observing strategy may have prevented the detection of faint sources with broad lines at the lowest flux levels but that it is most likely not a limiting factor in the ensemble , as the @xmath347 typically are up to a factor of @xmath350 higher than the measured @xmath284 for the brighter half of the @xmath319 range .",
    "similar lines indicating the inferred limits in velocity dispersion and size of the data sets and resulting from the observing strategy are plotted in figures  [ fig - lhasigmarha ] and [ fig - mstarsigmarha ] .",
    "inspection of these figures leads to the same conclusions about the apparent trends with observed h@xmath0 luminosity and stellar mass as with observed h@xmath0 flux .",

    "normalized to a total integration time of 1hr , the corresponding limits are @xmath354 and @xmath355",

    "@xcite had estimated an average factor of @xmath358 `` aperture correction '' accounting for slit losses and slit misalignment possibly missing part of the sources emission .",
    "absolute flux calibration is challenging for both narrow - band imaging and long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "for sinfoni , the full coverage of the atmospheric bands with each of the gratings allows us to synthetize the broad - band fluxes of our telluric standards , which should help reduce uncertainties of the absolute flux calibration .",
    "in addition , with the full 2d mapping , we recover the total fluxes of the sources irrespective of their sizes , p.a . , or",
    "if the comparison with our sins bm / bx  galaxies applies to the nirspec sample as a whole , the average aperture correction used by @xcite might have been overestimated by @xmath221 .    in terms of integrated velocity dispersion and half - light radii ,",
    "the sinfoni measurements are on average 10% larger ( scatter 0.18  dex ) and 5% smaller ( scatter 0.13  dex ) .",
    "the agreement is remarkable considering that the nirspec slit apertures may have missed part of the galaxies , and the sizes were estimated also from the long - slit data . when significant , the differences between fluxes , velocity dispersions , and sizes of individual objects can be attributed to possible slit misalignment with respect to the major axis of the galaxies , or to the proximity of bright night sky lines which may have affected more the lower spectral resolution nirspec data .",

    "the fluxes for the nirspec sample in these plots have been scaled by the factor of two aperture correction estimated by @xcite ; for the purpose of this comparison , the @xmath359 difference with the factor of 1.6 we inferred above has little impact .",
    "overall , the sins sample covers the same range of h@xmath0 fluxes , luminosities , intrinsic integrated velocity dispersions , and half - light radii as the nirspec sample .",

    "both samples cover a very comparable range , with the median for the nirspec sample being only @xmath3 lower than the median for the sins sample ( reflecting the somewhat more important tail at @xmath361 ) . in all of these properties ,",
    "the differences in median values between the sins and nirspec samples are much smaller than the ranges covered .    in view of the significant overlap ( to a given @xmath6 magnitude ) between the bm / bx  and @xmath37 populations ( to which almost all our sins near-/mid - ir selected galaxies belong",
    "even if not explicitly selected so ) , it may not be surprising to find large overlap in integrated h@xmath0 properties between the sins and nirspec samples .",
    "in addition , for both studies , the same requirement of an optical spectroscopic redshift was applied in the target selection , leading to similar biases towards the bluer and brighter part of the high redshift population compared to a pure @xmath6-selected sample (   [ sect - representativeness ] and @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps the most interesting outcome of the comparisons above , based on real data sets , is that even if the total fluxes are subject to significant uncertainties from aperture corrections , slit spectroscopy seems to be reliable in recovering the integrated emission line widths and even the sizes of faint high - redshift galaxies under typical observing conditions .",

    "for sins , while we did emphasize somewhat larger brighter objects at early stages , we took care subsequently ( for about 2/3 of the final sample ) of minimizing such a selection bias .",
    "it seems unclear what factors played what role in the overall size differences , and it could reflect a genuine difference of the galaxies properties ( we discuss this point further in   [ sect - kinematics ] ) .",

    "we note however that the factor of @xmath426 for extra attenuation may not be appropriate for other extinction laws because it was derived for a @xcite reddening law .",
    "the impact of metallicity is further addressed below .    with the assumption of @xmath370 , the extinction - corrected h@xmath0 luminosities and equivalent widths are overall about 30% higher than the model predictions .",
    "this offset is smaller than the scatter , but it is still possible that other sources unrelated to the young massive ionizing stars make a moderate contribution to the observed h@xmath0 line emission ( which would also cause some scatter ) .",
    "however , none of the four galaxies with known agn has any significant excess in measured intrinsic properties compared to the predictions . because the sources with agn do not stand as outliers in the distributions , the quantitative results above are hardly changed when excluding them .    as alternative to an @xmath211-dependent scaling of the extra attenuation towards the regions ,",

    "an @xmath211-dependent correction means that the global differential extinction between the regions and the stellar populations depends on the averaged gas column density .",
    "given that this behaviour is observed in local star - forming galaxies and starbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the offset in observed h@xmath0 equivalent width versus the model predictions is therefore a robust result .",
    "what other effects could lead to lower intrinsic h@xmath0 luminosities and equivalent widths compared to the predictions ( or overestimated predicted quantities ) ?",
    "it is well known that metallicity influences the h ionizing rate relative to the stellar rest - uv / optical photospheric emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "lower metallicities would produce the opposite effect , increasing further the mismatch between measured and predicted quantities .",

    "we examine this possibility in the next subsection .",
    "we focus on the h@xmath0 equivalent widths , which provide a measure of the current star formation rate as traced by h@xmath0 relative to an average over the galaxies lifetimes as traced by stars dominating the underlying continuum .",

    "model curves computed from the @xcite synthesis code as described in   [ sub - intrinsic_prop ] are shown with solid lines for different star formation histories : constant star formation rate ( csf ) , and exponentially declining sfrs with @xmath189-folding timescales @xmath436 , 30 , and 10  myr ( as representative cases ) .",
    "the curves are plotted for ages of @xmath437 ; over this range , our calculations agree well with predictions from the synthesis codes starburst99 @xcite or stars @xcite for similar imf and solar metallicity .    in figure  [ fig - ewssedprop]_a _ , the distribution of our sins galaxies occupies a large region of the diagram consistent with a wide range of constant to declining star formation histories , and that might suggest our sed modeling with three cases was indeed too simplistic",

    "indeed , the sed modeling by @xcite , based on the same photometry , evolutionary synthesis code , and assumptions but including correction for h@xmath0 line emission , leads to much lower ages for all four sources , as well as typically higher @xmath211 and sfrs and lower @xmath327 ( these authors considered a wider range of star formation histories but found a best - fit csf , as we do ) .",
    "younger ages would bring these sources in better agreement with the model csf curve .    in figure  [ fig - ewssedprop]_b _ , for the case of extra attenuation towards the regions , the distribution of data points tightens about the csf model curve ( albeit with significant scatter , to which the various uncertainties in measurements and sed modeling contribute ) .",
    "to some extent , the shift in data points between panels _ a _ and _ b _ reflects the well - known degeneracies between age , extinction , and star formation history in sed modeling ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "taking into account the uncertainties on the ratios , two of the rotation - dominated sources as well as the dispersion - dominated object are within @xmath482 of the boundary .",

    "we preferentially modeled disk - like systems and the @xmath478 ratio can be most robustly determined for the larger and brighter ones that are well - sampled out to large radii , where the rotation curve flattens and the intrinsic local velocity dispersion is best constrained .    to allow a more general analysis of all of our sins h@xmath0 sample galaxies , we defined a working criterion involving the full observed velocity gradient @xmath483 ( uncorrected for inclination ) and the integrated line width @xmath335 as follows .",
    "based on simulations of disk galaxies with various ratios of intrinsic circular velocity to local velocity dispersion and a range of sizes and dynamical masses appropriate for our sample , the cross - over between rotation- and dispersion - dominated systems at @xmath479 occurs around a ratio of @xmath484 .",
    "this is the case for the typical spatial resolution achieved with both ao - assisted as well as seeing - limited observations , with the exception of very compact sources in seeing - limited data where the small observed gradients could still be consistent with a rotation - dominated system .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath478 corresponds to an intrinsic and inclination - corrected property of disks , whereas @xmath485 is an observed quantity , with @xmath483 taken as the maximum projected velocity difference @xmath486 measured from the observed velocity field .",

    "all 13 rotation - dominated sources satisfy @xmath488 ( see table  [ tab - dyn ] ) ; the dispersion - dominated source also does but is just @xmath482 away from the boundary in both ratios .",
    "although conceptually devised for disks , this classification can also be indicative for mergers where the @xmath476 term then represents the orbital velocity of the system .",
    "obviously , the @xmath485 ratio is an approximate diagnostic because of its sensitivity to the inclination of the systems and to the contribution of large - scale velocity gradients to the integrated line width .",
    "it nevertheless provides a useful ( if approximate ) probe of the nature of the dynamical support in the cases where the data quality prevents reliable detailed kinematic modeling .    altogether , combining the above criteria based on the h@xmath0 kinematics , the sins h@xmath0 sample includes @xmath45 of clearly identified disk - like galaxies , @xmath45 of clearly identified mergers or interacting systems , and @xmath45 of sources with typically more compact morphologies and kinematics that appear to be dominated by velocity dispersion as compared to their velocity gradients .",
    "as we discuss in the following sub - sections , the proportion of disk - like systems tends to increase at higher masses while dispersion - dominated systems appear more ubiquitous at lower masses .",
    "the overall classification is unlikely to be significantly affected by the 10 non - detected sources in our sample .",
    "the disks and mergers classified quantitatively by kinemetry do not differentiate in global photometric , stellar , and in integrated h@xmath0 properties ( see   [ sect - representativeness ] and   [ sub - lineprop ] ) .",
    "dispersion - dominated objects may possibly be more ubiquitous among lower - mass galaxies ( see   [ sub - compact ] and   [ sub - dynstate ] ) .",
    "however , since the non - detections show no trend with photometric and stellar properties (   [ sect - representativeness ] ) we do not expect that they would be biased towards one class or the other .",
    "because of our observing strategy and sensitivity limits (   [ sub - detlim ] ) , we may be missing more extended sources with lower averaged h@xmath0 surface brightnesses , but these could be either disk- or merger - like systems .",
    "we verified and conclude similarly for the five galaxies further excluded in the discussion of kinematics because of too low s / n per resolution element .",
    "therefore , there is no evidence that the classification of our sins h@xmath0 sample should be biased by the relatively small fraction ( @xmath221 ) of undetected and unclassifiable targets .",
    "as found in our previous studies of various subsets of the sins sample , a majority of those sources exhibit compelling kinematic signatures of ordered rotation in a disk - like configuration , including a smooth and monotonic velocity gradient ( in the best cases showing the classical `` spider - diagram '' of pure disk rotation ) , alignment of the morphological and kinematic major axes ( see also   [ sub - profiles ] ) , and , in several cases , a global peak in the velocity dispersion map close to the morphological / kinematic center .",
    "these have been discussed extensively by @xcite and @xcite to which we refer for details of individual cases .",
    "interestingly , even in the largest and most regular massive disks ( @xmath489 across with rotation velocities of @xmath490 ) , the inferred intrinsic local velocity dispersion is quite substantial , with @xmath491 .",

    "our dynamical modeling accounts for the spatial and spectral resolution of the data , and so the high inferred levels of intrinsic local velocity dispersion are not caused by beam - smearing of the inner rotation curve or of a central unresolved source with broad line width .",
    "the dispersion - dominated systems would have still lower inferred @xmath495 ratios , assuming disk dynamics .",
    "however , they are also typically very compact and less well resolved spatially , so that the final verdict is still out as to what their intrinsic @xmath478 is .",

    "these small - scale perturbations could be produced by the presence and mutual interactions of the observed luminous / massive star - forming clumps ( as seen in numerical simulations by , e.g. , @xcite ) , or the proximity of small satellites .",
    "the dispersion - dominated objects tend to be the more compact sources among our sins sample .",

    "we adopted a fixed solar metallicity , a @xcite imf , and the @xcite reddening law ( applied for a uniform foreground screen of obscuring dust ) .",
    "the attenuation due to intergalactic h opacity was accounted for following the prescriptions of @xcite , and lyman continuum absorption was approximated by setting the flux of the synthetic templates equal to zero at @xmath594   .",
    "we considered three combinations of star formation history ( sfh ) and dust content : constant star formation ( csf ) and dust , single stellar population ( ssp ) with instantaneous star formation at @xmath595 and no dust , and an intermediate case of an exponentially declining star formation rate with timescale @xmath190 .",
    "these choices are admittedly simplistic , and likely to somewhat bias the overall results ( for instance in terms of absolute ages ) . for consistency ,",
    "comparisons of derived stellar properties for our sins h@xmath0 sample should thus be limited to those for other samples at similar redshifts obtained with similar sfhs ( or families thereof ) , as we do in the context of this paper .",
    "the model seds were obtained by convolving the synthetic spectra with the filter curves , which account properly for the full system throughput for each of the photometric bandpasses considered .",
    "the redshift was fixed at the h@xmath0 redshift of the sources ( or the optical redshift for sources undetected in our h@xmath0 data ) .",
    "the age , extinction , and luminosity scaling of the model seds to the observed seds were the free parameters in the fitting , which is based on chi - squared minimization .",
    "we restricted the ages considered between a minimum of 50  myr ( to avoid implausibly young and extremely obscured best - fits to the reddest galaxies ) and a maximum corresponding to the age of the universe at the redshift of each source .",
    "the stellar mass we use corresponds to the mass of stars still alive and stellar remnants .",
    "the adopted results were then taken as the best - fit among the three combinations of sfh@xmath64dust .",
    "the three choices of sfh@xmath64dust are obviously very simplistic .",
    "however , we opted for this as some of the targets have only @xmath192 photometric bands , limiting the number of free parameters possible to keep the number of degrees of freedom @xmath596 in the fits .",
    "formal ( random ) uncertainties on the best - fitting parameters were obtained from 200 monte carlo realizations ( randomly varying the observed seds assuming gaussian photometric uncertainties ) , and taking the 68% confidence intervals of the distributions of best - fit results . for five of our sins h@xmath0 sample galaxies , lower confidence intervals of 0 are derived on their best - fit ages of 50  myr , i.e. the minimum allowed .",
    "this is obviously artificial and due to the discrete age grid and strict lower age limit in our modeling procedure .",
    "we did not attempt to correct for emission line contribution in our sed modeling .",
    "again , the main reason is consistency with the sed modeling of the reference @xmath6-selected sample , for which this contribution is unknown for the very large majority of sources .",
    "in addition , while it would in principle be possible to correct for h@xmath0 and [ ] emission for all our sources , it is not always possible to account for other potentially bright emission lines in other near - ir and optical bands ( e.g. , ly@xmath0 , [ ] ) for lack of measurements .",
    "this is not expected to affect our results in a major way , as the line fluxes  at least for h@xmath0  contribute on average @xmath279 of the broad - band emission ( median of 7% , with first and third quartile of the distribution at 5% and 13% ; see table  [ tab - hameas ] ) . other lines together will not make significantly larger contribution to the broad - band fluxes .",
    "the main effect of correcting for h@xmath0 is generally to reduce the derived stellar masses , ages , and extinction , and would be largest for our @xmath6-faintest targets with highest h@xmath0 equivalent width and specific star formation rate ( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by far , the largest h@xmath0 contribution is inferred for @xmath241 ( 57% ) and this likely drives the best - fit towards a higher stellar mass , an older age , and a higher extinction .",
    "nevertheless , the trends in the ensemble properties discussed in   [ sect - ha_prop ] and [ sect - dust_sf ] are not qualitatively altered because few galaxies have contributions in excess of @xmath597 .",
    "comparison of our sed modeling results to those from the studies of the respective surveys ( when available ) indicate overall good agreement , with differences generally attributable to the different model assumptions and ingredients , or to our not accounting for line emission contribution .",
    "the formal fitting uncertainties derived from our monte carlo realizations do not take into account the impact of our choice of model ingredients and assumptions .",
    "in particular , the metallicity , reddening law , and imf as well as the adopted synthesis code and set of star formation histories can all have important effects and lead to systematic variations in derived properties .",
    "these are still poorly constrained from observations for @xmath19 galaxies . for our sins h@xmath0 sample , the number of bands available to construct the seds is limited for many of the galaxies . together with the non - uniform depth and wavelength coverage of the photometry from the various parent surveys and the known degeneracies among model parameters , this prevents a meaningful attempt at constraining these parameters in our modeling .",
    "in addition , other independent empirical constraints either do not exist or are insufficient ( except for very few sources ) . since our main purpose is to investigate relative trends and ensemble properties within our sins h@xmath0 sample and with respect to the general population of @xmath19 galaxies , an exhaustive discussion of the effects of variations in sed modeling parameters is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is nevertheless worth assessing the possible impact of different choices in order to estimate the systematic uncertainties and verify the robustness of our conclusions .",
    "we tested the impact of models with a different treatment of stellar evolutionary phases .",
    "specifically , we used the @xcite models with the @xcite imf ( the differences between the @xcite and @xcite imfs have a negligible effect compared to that of the different models ) . to gauge the possible impact of changes in assumed metallicity and reddening law , we ran additional suites of @xcite models with metallicity of @xmath598 and 2.5 times solar , and using alternatively extinction laws for the milky way @xcite and for the small magellanic cloud @xcite",
    ". the metallicities explored bracket the range inferred for @xmath19 star - forming galaxies in a similar stellar mass range as our sins h@xmath0 sample ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on the variations in best - fit properties of individual objects with these different models , we infer typical ( median ) systematic uncertainties of @xmath599 for the stellar masses , of @xmath600 for the visual extinctions @xmath211 , and of factors of @xmath465 for the stellar ages as well as for the absolute and specific star formation rates ( sfrs ) .",
    "the main impact on the sins h@xmath0 sample properties of using the @xcite instead of the @xcite models is for the stellar ages ( the median becomes about twice younger ) and for the absolute and specific sfrs ( median values higher by factors of @xmath601 and 3 , respectively ) .",
    "the median best - fit extinction increases a little by @xmath602 .",
    "the effects on the stellar masses are moderate , with the median decreasing by @xmath221 . the variations in ensemble properties for the reference @xmath603 , @xmath2 sample from the cdfs fireworks catalogue @xcite considered in   [ sect - representativeness ]",
    "are similar ( within @xmath193 for the median values ) . as for the @xcite models , the effects of changes in the assumed metallicity and extinction law are most important for the stellar ages and for the absolute and specific sfrs . compared to the results for solar metallicity and the @xcite reddening law , the variations in median values for the sins h@xmath0 sample",
    "are by factors of @xmath604 for the age , @xmath605 for the sfr , and @xmath606 for the specific sfr .",
    "the variations in median @xmath211 is within @xmath607 to @xmath608 .",
    "the stellar masses are least affected , with the median varying by factors of @xmath609 .",
    "we further computed models with a @xcite imf ; this affects essentially only the stellar masses and absolute sfrs , which increase by a nearly identical factor of @xmath610 . in all cases ,",
    "variations in ensemble properties for the reference cdfs sample are comparable and in the same sense as for the sins h@xmath0 sample .",
    "the relative comparisons between the two samples in   [ sect - representativeness ] are therefore unaffected .",
    "we verified the consequences of the variations in model ingredients and assumptions considered above on all other results of this paper that depend on properties derived from our sed modeling .",

    "the effective psf shape is also very close to gaussian . for the purpose of characterizing the achieved resolution the assumption of a gaussian provides a satisfactory estimate of the spatial resolution element of the ao data as well ( and the median and average ellipticity is 0.06 , or an axis ratio of 0.89 ) .    to examine possible systematic structure in our psfs , we constructed higher s / n profiles by averaging the effective psf images associated with h@xmath0 data sets of the sins h@xmath0 sample galaxies .",
    "one psf was created for the @xmath234 scale , including both seeing - limited and ao - assisted data ( there are only three psfs obtained with ao at this scale , and excluding them does not change the averaged profile ) , and one for the @xmath236 scale with ao .",
    "these are plotted in figure  [ fig - psfs ] . to obtain a representative average psf for the @xmath234 data , we excluded the six psfs with @xmath612 ( four of which are for undetected sources ) , so that 46 psf images were combined . for the ao psf at @xmath236",
    ", we included all but one of the five effective psfs ; the psf of @xmath497 was excluded because it is a double star resolved in our high resolution data .",
    "the psfs were normalized to a common peak value of unity before combination , and an additional @xmath92-clipping was applied to exclude residual bad pixels present in some cases .",
    "the combined psfs reveal more clearly extended wings and , as expected , somewhat more prominently in the ao - assisted @xmath236 data .",
    "the profiles are best fit by a narrow core and a broad underlying component , both elliptical gaussian in shape .",
    "the relative peak intensities of the narrow core to the broad component are 3.7 and 2.7 for the averaged psfs at 125 and @xmath236 , respectively , and their relative fwhms are approximately 0.5 and 0.4 . to quantify the effects of uncertainties in the psf fwhm and shape on kinematic modeling , we performed the following simulations .",
    "we used model thin disks generated with dysmal ( the same code as used by @xcite and previously by @xcite ) .",
    "we chose a fiducial model with parameters representative of the sins disk - like galaxies , and we varied the inclination between 10 and 80 degrees .",
    "the models were binned spatially and spectrally to the sinfoni pixel size .",
    "we convolved the models spectrally as appropriate for @xmath6-band sinfoni data , and spatially using different psfs : the real effective psfs constructed from the acquisition stars , and various model psfs obtained by fitting the real psfs with a two - dimensional single circular gaussian , single elliptical gaussian , and double elliptical gaussian ( with narrow core and broad wings ) .",
    "we also considered a simple circular gaussian of fwhm @xmath613 for the seeing - limited mode data and @xmath614 for the ao data at the @xmath236 scale .",
    "we used 18 sets of such real and model psfs , corresponding to the 18 galaxies modeled by @xcite .",
    "we then extracted the velocity field and velocity dispersion maps from the convolved model disks as described in (   [ sub - extrmaps ] ) . for a given disk inclination and set of psfs",
    ", we compared the differences in extracted velocity fields and dispersion maps .    the maximum differences in relative velocities amount to @xmath597 or less across the velocity fields .",
    "they are smaller for the velocity widths , @xmath615 for the ao cases and @xmath616 for the seeing - limited cases across the dispersion maps .",
    "the results are little sensitive to galaxy inclination .",
    "these maximum differences are comparable to or smaller than our typical formal measurements uncertainties .",
    "we conclude from these simulations that the typical uncertainties on the psf size and shape of our sinfoni data , including the presence or not of possible extended wings or the assumption of a common psf with representative average fwhm of the data sets , have only a small impact on the interpretation of the extracted kinematics and on the modeling , and are not significant in view of other uncertainties such as the intrinsic mass distribution or deviations from pure disk kinematics .",
    "the data reduction procedure described in   [ sub - datared ] produces a noise cube by taking the standard deviation of all values that are averaged for a given pixel in the final combined 3d cube ( after clipping outliers ) and normalizing by the squared root of the number of pixels used . due to various factors , including the slitlet projection onto the detector ( with two pixels sampling a resolution element along one spatial axis ) and , most importantly , the data reduction , the resulting noise is not expected to scale linearly with aperture size as for pure uncorrelated gaussian noise .",
    "this is analogous to what is seen in broad - band imaging data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the effective noise @xmath617 increases faster with linear size of aperture @xmath618 than the gaussian scaling @xmath619 , where @xmath620 is the pixel - to - pixel rms , even if for any given aperture size the noise has a gaussian behaviour .",
    "to investigate the noise properties in our reduced sinfoni data , we carried out a similar analysis as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for every spectral channel , we measured the flux in non - overlapping square apertures of equal size placed at random over the area of deepest integration ( i.e. the region of overlap of all exposures for data taken with the on - source dithering pattern ) .",
    "aperture sizes @xmath621 from 1 to 8 pixels were considered in turn . for the spectral channels that include line emission from the galaxies ( and for all channels for those that are brightest in continuum emission )",
    ", we excluded apertures that overlap with the source . for each @xmath621 and spectral channel , the distribution of the measurement fluctuations in the `` empty apertures '' is well approximated by a gaussian , indicating gaussian behaviour for a given aperture size and spectral channel .",
    "the effective noise @xmath622 was taken as the dispersion of the best - fit gaussian to the distribution of empty aperture fluxes for each @xmath621 and channel . the resulting function normalized by the relation for uncorrelated noise , @xmath623 $ ] , first rises rapidly with @xmath621 and",
    "then flattens and varies much more slowly .",
    "this transition in effective noise properties occurs around a characteristic spatial scale of 4  pixels , corresponding to twice a slitlet width .",
    "it thus most plausibly reflects differences in the contribution from correlated noise within and across slitlets .",
    "analytically , a logarithmic function of the form @xmath624    = a(\\lambda ) + b(\\lambda)\\,\\log(n ) \\label{eq - noisemodellam}\\ ] ] provides a good description of the observed noise behaviour .",
    "obviously , the number of non - overlapping apertures is rather limited for the largest @xmath621 values because of the small fov and so the @xmath622 are less tightly constrained .",
    "moreover , we are ultimately also interested in the noise properties of the channels including the emission lines to be fitted , where we can only measure reliably the fluctuations in empty sky regions around the source for small aperture sizes . however , the measured values of @xmath623 $ ] across all wavelength channels show a typical rms scatter around the median by @xmath625 , and the @xmath552 and @xmath440 coefficients show fairly narrow distributions .",
    "this suggests that a single set of @xmath552 and @xmath440 values can provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the noise properties throughout all spectral channels of a given data cube .",
    "we thus repeated the analysis considering all empty apertures flux measurements over all spectral channels to derive a global @xmath626 $ ] .",
    "the corresponding relation follows closely the median of @xmath623 $ ] , and we can fit the same function as in eq .",
    "[ eq - noisemodellam ] to derive global values of @xmath552 and @xmath440 . in general , the median of the @xmath552 and @xmath440 values for the individual channels is close to the @xmath627 and @xmath628 obtained by a fit to the median of @xmath626 $ ] taken over the individual channels .",
    "also , the fit to the global @xmath626 $ ] from the analysis carried out over all channels together leads to parameters close to @xmath627 and @xmath628 ( though sometimes with significantly lower @xmath552 ) , confirming the functional form of our noise model out to the larger apertures considered . for our applications , we adopted the set of @xmath627 and @xmath628 .    to compute the noise spectrum to be used in the emission line fitting to spectra integrated over apertures of equivalent linear size @xmath629",
    ", we applied @xmath630 \\times      ( a_{\\rm med } + b_{\\rm med}\\,\\log(n ) ) , \\label{eq - noisemodel}\\ ] ] where the first factor accounts for the wavelength dependence of the noise level and the second factor provides a global description of the non - gaussian , correlated nature of the noise properties in the reduced sinfoni data cubes . while this is not an exact measurement since the wavelength dependence of the @xmath552 and @xmath440 parameters",
    "is ignored , the analysis shows that this approximates the effective noise in @xmath631 apertures across all wavelengths on average to @xmath625 in our h@xmath0 data sets ( with a range from @xmath632 up to @xmath185 ) .    as a quantitative example of the application of our noise model",
    ", we consider the apertures used to extract the integrated spectrum .",
    "the noise spectrum derived from this empirical model for each source is on average a factor of 2 higher than what would be inferred assuming pure gaussian noise propagation ( with a range from 1.6 to 2.7 among the data sets ) .",
    "we also determined the spectral pixel - to - pixel rms directly from the integrated spectra , in regions free of night sky lines and of galaxy line emission out to @xmath633 around h@xmath0 .",
    "the spectral rms is typically @xmath634 lower than the @xmath482 noise in the same wavelength interval obtained from application of our noise model .",
    "only one galaxy appears to deviate significantly in that respect : for @xmath287 , which has the largest aperture size scaling from the noise model ( factor of 2.7 higher than for gaussian noise propagation ) , the noise spectrum gives @xmath482 uncertainties a factor of 1.8 higher than the spectral rms in intervals free of night sky and galaxy emission lines .",
    "while the noise properties for such data sets as obtained with sinfoni are complex , the results above indicate that overall our method is able to constrain them to within @xmath279 .",
    "the advantage is that it allows to derive the noise at each wavelength ( thus preserving the variations across the full spectrum ) and takes into account the `` redistribution '' of the noise on different spatial scales resulting notably from the reduction procedure ( e.g. , from interpolations applied at different stages ) .",
    "figures  [ fig - maps_bmbx1 ] to [ fig - maps_gdds2 ] present the velocity - integrated h@xmath0 linemaps , the position - velocity diagrams , and the integrated spectra of all detected sources from our sins h@xmath0 sample .",
    "the position - velocity diagrams were extracted from the data cubes , without additional smoothing from median - filtering , in a synthetic slit 6  pixels wide along the major axis of the galaxies , indicated by the rectangle on the h@xmath0 maps .",
    "this width corresponds to @xmath635 or @xmath636 the median psf fwhm for the data sets at the @xmath234 scale , and @xmath637 or @xmath638 the median psf fwhm for those at the @xmath236 scale .",
    "the integrated spectra were extracted from the unsmoothed data cubes in circular apertures , with the radii adopted so as to enclose @xmath15 of the total flux based on the curve - of - growth analysis .",
    "these apertures for each galaxy and instrument setup are also shown on the h@xmath0 maps , with the radii listed in table  [ tab - hameas ] . for galaxies obtained at both seeing - limited and ao pixel scales , we show the results for each setup .",
