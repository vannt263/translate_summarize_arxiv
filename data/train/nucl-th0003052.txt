    "an important advantage of the dynamical symmetry ( ds ) approach @xcite in nuclear theory is the possibility to describe consistently various collective bands of heavy deformed nuclei @xcite . generally , the ds concept is based on the assumption that the physical system possesses a `` primary '' symmetry with respect to a given group , called ds group .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reduces this symmetry to the group of invariance of the system ( which for the nuclear system coincides with the angular momentum group so(3 ) ) and thus the energy spectrum is generated @xcite@xcite .",
    "the lie algebra of the ds group is then reduced to the algebra of the group of invariance and is referred to as spectrum generating algebra .",
    "the basic idea of ds approach in heavy deformed nuclei is that their collective bands can be united into one or several multiplets , appearing in this reduction @xcite .",
    "it provides a natural way to study the interaction between a particular couple of bands as well as the attendant spectroscopic characteristics of nuclei .",
    "various classification schemes with band coupling have been developed on the basis of ds approach .",
    "well known models , such as the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite , the symplectic models @xcite and the fermion dynamical symmetry model @xcite , provide a good overall description of nuclear collective phenomena , covering the different regions of vibrational , rotational and transitional nuclei .    on the other hand , some models , based on the su(3 ) dynamical symmetry , reproduce successfully the particular characteristics of rotational bands in deformed nuclei .",
    "such models are the pseudo - su(3 ) model @xcite , which has microscopic motivations , as well as the vector - boson model ( vbm ) with su(3 ) dynamical symmetry @xcite , which allows a relevant phenomenological treatment of the su(3 ) multiplets in nuclei .",
    "while in the su(3 ) limit of the ibm the possible irreducible representations ( irreps ) ( @xmath5 ) are restricted by the total number of bosons describing the specific nucleus , in the vbm the possible su(3 ) irreps ( @xmath6 ) are not restricted by the underlying theory .",
    "however , it has been shown recently @xcite that some favored regions of ( @xmath6 ) multiplets in the vbm could be outlined through the numerical analysis of the experimental data available for the ground ( @xmath7 ) and the @xmath1- collective bands of even  even deformed nuclei .",
    "( the favored multiplets provide the best model descriptions . ) as a result , a systematic behavior of the su(3 ) symmetry properties of rotational nuclei has been established in terms of the vbm . it suggests the presence of a transition between a scheme , in which the @xmath7 and the @xmath1 bands are coupled into one and the same ( @xmath6 ) irrep and a scheme , where these two bands belong to different irreps .",
    "in addition it has been supposed that the fine systematic properties of rotational spectra could be interpreted as a manifestation of a more general dynamical symmetry .    as a first step in the recovering of the dynamical mechanism causing such a transition",
    ", one should study the way in which the su(3 ) symmetry is reduced in the ( @xmath6)- plane .",
    "in particular , it is of interest to reproduce the limits , in which the quantum numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 go to infinity , i.e. the cases , in which the su(3 ) irreps are not finite anymore .",
    "these limits correspond to the so called su(3 ) contraction process , in which the algebra of su(3 ) goes to the algebra of the semi - direct product t@xmath10so(3 ) , i.e. @xmath11 ( t@xmath12 is the group of 5-dimensional translations generated by the components of the su(3)- quadrupole operators ) @xcite .",
    "generally , the contraction limit corresponds to a singular linear transformation of the basis of a given lie algebra .",
    "the transformed structure constants approach a well - defined limits and a new lie algebra , called contracted algebra , results @xcite .",
    "the original and the contracted algebra are not isomorphic .    on the above basis it is expected that in the su(3 ) contraction limit the space of the su(3 ) irreps should undergo a respective limiting transition . as a result the su(3 ) multiplets should be disintegrated to sets of various independent bands .",
    "it is , therefore , reasonable to consider this limit as a natural way in which the band - mixing interactions vanish .",
    "it is important to remark that the su(3 ) contraction process is a situation in which a compact group goes to a non - compact one .",
    "hence , one could try to interpret the vanishing @xmath7@xmath1 band - mixing interaction as a transition from a compact to a non - compact ds group .    in the present work",
    "we realize the above considerations through the formalism of the vbm .",
    "our purpose is to examine the various directions in the ( @xmath6)-plane by investigating the respective changes in the structure of the su(3 ) multiplets in terms of model defined spectroscopic characteristics of rotational nuclei . as such",
    ", we consider here the su(3 ) energy splitting and the @xmath7@xmath1 interband transitions , which carry important information about the link between the two bands .",
    "it is known that the energy splitting of the multiplet determines to a great extent the systematic behavior of the su(3 ) dynamical symmetry in deformed nuclei @xcite .    in the vbm",
    "relatively simple analytic expressions for the energies and the transition probabilities can be derived both for the lowest @xmath13 states of any ( @xmath6)- multiplet and for all the states of any ( @xmath14 ) multiplet .",
    "the analytic expressions for the @xmath13 states allow one to examine the su(3 ) characteristics of nuclei in terms of two - dimensional surfaces in the ( @xmath6)-plane , while in the ( @xmath15 ) direction one is able to investigate the behavior of the full set of states in the multiplet , i.e. the states with @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath16 states of the irreps with @xmath17 can be treated numerically .",
    "in such a way , a relevant combination of analytic and numerical analyses could be applied in order to reveal the systematic behavior of all the states of su(3 ) irreps in the ( @xmath6)-plane including the limiting cases of su(3 ) group contraction .",
    "the collective scheme of the vbm is constructed by using the irreps with @xmath18 and comprises the following two su(3 ) contraction limits :    \\(i ) @xmath19 , with @xmath9 finite ;    \\(ii ) @xmath19 , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "below we provide a detailed study of the most important spectroscopic characteristics of the @xmath7 and the @xmath1 band in the above limiting cases .",
    "it will be shown that our approach gives a reasonable interpretation of the corresponding experimental data and leads to rather clear conclusions about the rearrangement of collective rotational bands in heavy deformed nuclei .    in sec .",

    "vi the conclusions are given .",
    "the vector - boson model ( vbm ) with su(3 ) dynamical symmetry is founded on the assumption that the low - lying collective states of deformed even  even nuclei can be described by means of two distinct kinds of vector bosons , whose creation operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 are o(3 ) vectors and in addition transform according to two independent su(3 ) irreps of the type @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the vector bosons provide a relevant construction of the su(3 ) angular momentum and quadrupole operators like the bosons in the schwinger realization of su(2 ) @xcite .",

    "it should be mentioned that the involvement of the interband transition ratio @xmath88 in the present fits leads to an increase in the quantum number @xmath9 above the @xmath195 values .",
    "actually , some trend of small increase in @xmath9 ( up to @xmath196 ) with the increase of @xmath8 is indicated for various isotope groups ( see , for example the yb isotopes in table  1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , in almost all nuclei under study the quantum number @xmath8 is essentially larger than @xmath9 , which is natural for the well deformed nuclei .",
    "several exceptions are observed in the nuclei far from the midshell region , such as @xmath197dy ( with @xmath198 ) and @xmath199w ( with @xmath200 ) where the interband transition ratios are very large @xmath201 .",
    "the above quantitative considerations show that the changes in the su(3 ) characteristics of nuclei ( especially the quantum number @xmath8 ) towards the middle of given rotational region could be associated with the corresponding decrease in the @xmath7@xmath1 band mixing interaction towards the su(3 ) contraction limits . in terms of our study",
    "the strong @xmath7@xmath1 splitting , observed near the middle of rotational regions , corresponds to the weak mutual perturbation of the bands .",
    "this is consistent with the respectively good rotational behavior of the @xmath7-band , which in this case could belong to a separate su(3 ) multiplet .",
    "[ see the experimental energy ratios , @xmath202 , given in table  1 . ]",
    "we remark that present analyses are based mainly on data in the rare earth region .",
    "actually table  1 includes only nuclei for which the @xmath7@xmath1 interband transition probabilities are measured .",
    "that is why only four actinides ( @xmath203th , @xmath204u ) are considered .",
    "nevertheless , they give an indication for similar behaviors of the splitting and the interband transition ratios as the ones in rare earth nuclei . on the other hand ,",
    "the generally stronger energy splitting , observed in the actinide region ( see also @xcite ) , suggests a generally weaker @xmath7@xmath1 coupling compared to the rare earth nuclei .",
    "we are now able to discuss the physical significance of the considered su(3 ) contraction limits as well as to depict the physically meaningful directions in the @xmath153- plane , which could be appropriate for studying the transition between the different band coupling schemes .",
    "the theoretical analyses and experimental data show that the limiting case ( i ) ( @xmath205 , with @xmath9 finite ) has a rather clear physical interpretation .",
    "it is consistent with the observed continuous increase of the @xmath7@xmath1 band splitting and the corresponding continuous decrease of the interband transition probabilities towards the midshell regions in rare earth nuclei .",
    "the limiting case ( ii ) ( @xmath80 ) does not have any similar direct interpretation .",
    "it suggests finite values for the splitting and the interband transition probabilities , while the bands do not interact in the framework of su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "in addition , it is well known that the case @xmath206 does not correspond to deformed nuclei , for which the inequality @xmath207 is satisfied .",
    "nevertheless the study of this limit is useful from the following viewpoint : it implies that the strong suppression of the band interaction as well as the transition between the different band coupling schemes could be realized at reasonable ( finite ) su(3 ) splitting . based on the above considerations",
    ", we deduce that the possibly interesting physically meaningful directions in the @xmath153plane should be associated with a consistent increase in the quantum numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "thus , any particular direction of interest could be easily estimated by using its intermediate behavior between the two considered limiting cases .    some discussion concerning the interacting boson model ( ibm ) classification scheme @xcite is appropriate at this point . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been suggested that for deformed nuclei both the vbm scheme ( with @xmath7@xmath1 band coupling ) and the ibm one ( with @xmath42@xmath1 band coupling ) could be considered as complementary schemes .",
    "it has also been pointed out that the su(3 ) scheme of the vbm is naturally applicable to nuclei with weak energy splitting , while strong splitting invokes the su(3 ) scheme of the ibm , in which the @xmath7- band is situated in a separate irrep .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical results and the experimental data given in the present work suggest that the vbm band coupling scheme is more appropriate near the ends of the rotational regions , while in the midshell regions the coupling scheme of the ibm is realized . in this respect",
    "the detailed comparison of both band - coupling mechanisms would be of interest .",
    "for example , the analytic expressions for the @xmath7@xmath1 interband transition probabilities , obtained in the framework of the ibm in @xcite , would be useful .",
    "[ see eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) of @xcite . ]",

( [ limb1l ] ) , ( [ limb2l ] ) ( [ limb3l ] ) ] of the present vbm scheme .    as an extension of the present studies it would be worthwhile to examine , in a similar way ,",
    "the link between the @xmath1- and the @xmath42- band .",
    "furthermore , besides the vbm scheme , one could refer in this case to the modifications of the ibm in which higher - order terms conserving the su(3 ) symmetry are added @xcite . the consistent study ( within both models ) of the ways in which the su(3 ) symmetry is reduced could give important information about the rearrangement of rotational bands into different su(3 ) irreps .    in the above context",
    ", we emphasize that the analyses implemented in the presented paper give a general prescription to handle the fine behavior of the band coupling interactions in any collective algebraic scheme in heavy deformed nuclei .",
    "actually , the group contraction process should play a major role in a transition between two different band coupling schemes .",
    "the transition from the compact su(3 ) group to the non - compact t@xmath10so(3 ) rotor group could be considered as a starting point in a process of reconstruction of various multiplets in a more general symplectic group of dynamical symmetry .",
    "( it is interesting to mention that the meaning of su(3 ) contraction has been also discussed ( though in a rather different aspect ) in reference to a possible phase transition between a superconductor and rigid rotor collective motion of nuclei @xcite . )",
    "we have derived analytic expressions for the energies and @xmath0 transition probabilities in the ground- and @xmath1-band states of even deformed nuclei within the vector - boson model with su(3 ) dynamical symmetry . on this basis",
    "we applied both analytic and numeric analyses to examine the behavior of the corresponding energy splitting and b(e2 ) transition ratios in the two su(3 ) contraction limits of the model , ( i ) ( @xmath19 , with @xmath9 finite ) , and ( ii ) ( @xmath209 ) .",
    "it has been shown that in both limits the @xmath7@xmath1 band mixing decreases asymptotically to zero . in case ( i )",
    "this is associated with the corresponding continuous increase in the splitting of the multiplet and the rapidly vanishing @xmath7@xmath1 interband transition link .",
    "case ( ii ) gives finite values for the energy splitting and the interband transition ratios which , however , should not be associated with any band coupling .",
    "the latter result implies that a strong reduction of the band interaction could be possible at finite su(3 ) splitting .",
    "thus , the present analyses outline the possible directions in the @xmath153-plane in which the @xmath7@xmath1 band coupling is reduced .    the experimental data on the ground- and @xmath1- band states in deformed even  even nuclei show clearly a pronounced increase in the @xmath7@xmath1 band splitting and a corresponding decrease in the interband transition probabilities towards the midshell regions .",
    "they suggest that the su(3 ) contraction effects in the @xmath7@xmath1 band coupling scheme should be sought in the best rotational nuclei , in which the mutual perturbation of the bands is weak .",
    "so , the experimental data and their quantitative estimation in the vbm framework strongly support our theoretical analyses .",
    "based on the presented investigation , we conclude that the transition from the @xmath7@xmath1 band coupling scheme to a scheme in which the @xmath7-band is situated in a separate irrep should be realized towards the midshell regions . in this respect",
    "the complementarity of the classification schemes of the vector - boson model with su(3 ) dynamical symmetry and the ibm becomes clear .",
