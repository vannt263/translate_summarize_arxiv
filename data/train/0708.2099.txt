    "the effect of the thermostat is _ not only _ to keep the temperature constant _ but also _ to ensure that each monomer moves diffusively , rather than ballistic .",
    "this is to mimic the effects of solvent viscosity in the high - damping limit , in which the inertia term can be dropped  @xcite .",
    "initially , the chain was created as a biased , non - self - avoiding random walk confined within the pore . to equilibrate the system and remove possible bead - bead overlaps , we simulated the system for a few thousand steps with a truncated wca potential .",

    "we complement our md simulations with lattice - based mc simulations . in our mc simulations ,",
    "the polymers were modeled as a self - avoiding walk on a cubic lattice between hard walls forming the cylinder .",
    "in contrast to the md simulations , where we typically used a cylindrical pore with a circular cross section , we mostly used one with a square cross section of area @xmath60 in the mc simulations .",
    "the latter is more compatible with the geometry of the cubic lattice ( on which the polymer lives ) .",
    "additionally , hard - core repulsions were defined as excluding conformations where two monomers occupy the same lattice site .    for the monte",
    "carlo moves , we adopted the `` wormhole '' method of houdayer  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm consists of a reptation - like motion so that the first bead jumps through a `` wormhole '' to a random position  not to be confused with reptation as a physical process in concentrated solutions  @xcite . during the wormhole move ,",
    "the polymer therefore consists of two disconnected segments .",
    "the reptation is continued , until a valid ( i.e. , connected ) polymer conformation is obtained .",
    "this algorithm is known to be very efficient for sampling the chain conformations of polymers with excluded volume in confinement or in dense polymer melts .",
    "we only use this wormhole method to study static properties , since , by its nature , the dynamics based on this method is completely unphysical .    between two chain conformations , we performed 1000 wormhole steps to assure statistical independence , and sampled in total 20,000 conformations per parameter set .",

    "the blob size distribution resembles a short chain in confinement @xmath136 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : eehist ] . in both cases ,",
    "the effect of confinement is marginal and chain back - folding is noticeable , leading to the exponential distribution for small @xmath130 .",
    "furthermore , using both simulations ( md and mc ) , we found that the distribution of @xmath130 is practically independent of the chain length if @xmath137 , i.e. , if the chain consists of at least 3 blobs .    .",
    "the solid line represents the extensiveness @xmath138 expected .",
    "two types of confined space were used : a cylinder and a brick , i.  e. , a tube with a circular and rectangular cross section , respectively . ]     of the single blob size , as a function of the tube diameter @xmath2 . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : befef ] , we used two types of confined space , a cylinder and a brick .",
    "the solid line represents the theoretically expected @xmath60-scaling . ]",
    "[ fig : befef ] shows @xmath139 , the ratio between the variances of the end - to - end distance and the blob size .",
    "if the fluctuations of the individual blobs are independent , this ratio should equal the number of blobs @xmath140 , i.  e. , the end - to - end fluctuation is extensive .",
    "the data was obtained from both md and mc simulations , and for two different shapes of the confined space each : a cylinder and a brick , i.  e. , a tube with a circular and square cross section , respectively .",
    "the discrepancy between the four cases is minor , however , we observe clear deviations from the linear relationship . the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : befef ] for up to @xmath141 are , in fact , better described by @xmath142 . for large @xmath25",
    ", the data falls onto a line , however shifted up by about 1 and with a slope of about @xmath143 .",
    "the shift is a finite - size effect that simply reflects that the size fluctuations of the two end ",
    "blobs are much larger .",
    "the slightly lower slope in turn indicates that the fluctuations between the blobs are not completely independent .",
    "we will discuss the implications of this finding below .    to further proceed with our discussion regarding the breakdown of extensiveness of the end fluctuation , we first focus on the variances @xmath127 , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : blobeef ] .",
    "we only took into account data points with @xmath137 , for which the chain length dependence of @xmath130 was negligible .",
    "the difference between the cylinder and the brick is again just an insignificant prefactor .",
    "however , while the shape of the @xmath130-distribution is very similar for the md and mc simulations ( i.  e. , approximately gaussian ) , there are significant differences in the @xmath2scaling of @xmath144 .",
    "the mc lattice simulations obey the theoretically expected @xmath145 law ( see eqn .  ) reasonably well , while in the md simulations , @xmath127 rather follows @xmath146 .",
    "the most plausible explanation for this difference is through effects near the cylinder surface .",
    "the prediction @xmath145 requires that the radial bead distribution can be written as a function of @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the radial coordinate  @xcite .",
    "however , in the off  lattice simulations , we observe layering effects of the width of about a bead diameter at the cylinder surface , which are absent on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "because this surface layer for @xmath149 still contains about 30% of the total volume , this makes a significant contribution .",
    "nevertheless , the radial distribution converges slowly to the universal distribution , and we expect the md result to cross over to a @xmath60-law for sufficiently large @xmath2 ; unfortunately , this is computationally inaccessible .",
    "the single - blob analysis presented in this section is consistent with the unexpected @xmath2dependence of @xmath115 ( and that of the relaxation time ) : we observe @xmath150 , where @xmath151 in the md simulations and @xmath152 in the mc simulations . in any case , @xmath153 .",
    "this results in @xmath154 for the md simulation and @xmath155 for the mc simulation , which are both in good agreement with our numerical findings for @xmath115 . finally , when combined with our @xmath34 analysis , the relation leads to a relaxation time @xmath156 , again in good agreement with our earlier observations .",
    "we have performed extensive simulations of a self  avoiding polymer under cylindrical confinement . in an effort to sample a wide parameter space ,",
    "we have complimented our off ",
    "lattice md simulations by lattice mc simulations , and considered chain lengths @xmath1 up to @xmath4 .",
    "most notably , both types of simulations have produced global relaxation times @xmath0 that have a much stronger @xmath2 dependence than expected from the earlier blob approach  @xcite .",
    "while our analysis of the longitudinal chain size @xmath8 for the case @xmath157 tends to support the picture of linear ordering of blobs as assumed in the blob approach , our results for @xmath0 for the same case @xmath158 do not show the _ dynamic _ blob scaling regime , in which the blob scaling of @xmath0 holds .",
    "our md simulation directly measured the time evolution of the end  to ",
    "end distance from which @xmath0 was obtained ; in our mc simulation we extracted @xmath0 from the variance of the end  to ",
    "end distance distribution @xmath109 through the relation @xmath159 , which we have demonstrated to hold in strong confinement .",
    "the absence of the dynamic blob  scaling regime in both types of simulations has been attributed to finite  size effects . to this end , we have examined the chain at the level of a single blob . in particular , we have examined the @xmath2dependence of @xmath127 and examined its relation with @xmath109 . even with up to @xmath160 blobs , @xmath161 does not hold . in other words ,",
    "the assumption of extensiveness of @xmath34 , which underlies the blob picture , is not satisfied in our simulations .",
    "moreover , the fluctuations of the individual blobs in our bead  spring model also suffer from finite size effects ; in our md simulations , we could not reach the expected @xmath145 scaling due to large surface contributions .",
    "this indicates that the number of beads per blob also has to be significantly larger than 100 , corresponding to a diameter which is at least 15 times larger than the effective bead diameter .",
    "our main findings can be summarized as @xmath162 when combined with our md result @xmath163 ( obtained for @xmath164 and @xmath165 ) , this relation leads to @xmath166 .",
    "if our mc result @xmath167 ( obtained for @xmath168 and @xmath169 ) is used instead , we obtain @xmath170 .",
    "both are quite different from the asymptotic scaling of @xmath171 .",
    "nevertheless , our results for @xmath0 seem to hold for @xmath172 , and should therefore be experimentally observable .",
    "importantly , our simulations show that , for reaching the asymptotic scaling limit with a bead  spring model , about 10,000 beads are necessary .",
    "the aspect ratio @xmath173 , which is identical to the number of blobs , has to be at least 30 .",
    "the chain ",
    "length requirement for the asymptotic scaling regime @xmath174 can then be satisfied , however , obtaining the relaxation of such a system by simulations will remain an intractable task for some time . for smaller chains and diameters , the blob - scaling picture has to be used with due caution .",
    "this is similar to recent findings for a polymer stretched by an external force without confinement  @xcite , and for the force  stretching relation of a polymer in cylindrical confinement  @xcite .",
    "in fact , we notice that even in experiments this regime is hard to reach .",
    "for instance , consider dna molecules trapped in a cylindrical pore .",
    "although the kuhn segments of dna are cylindrical and therefore our bead  model is not directly applicable , one can obtain some rough estimate on the minimally necessary system dimensions . to reach the classical self - avoiding polymer limit inside a blob of size",
    "@xmath2 , this diameter has to be significantly larger than the persistence length of dna , which is 50 nm .",
    "both our simulations and scaling analysis  @xcite , indicate that a pore diameter of about 1@xmath175 m is necessary .",
    "the extension of the chain in the pore should be at least 30 times the pore diameter , which requires a chain length of more than a million base pairs .",
    "this length is significantly larger than the 164,000 base pairs used in a recent experiment  @xcite .",
