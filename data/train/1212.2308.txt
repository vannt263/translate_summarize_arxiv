    "throughout this paper , we only consider finite undirected graphs with no multiple edges or loops . for",
    "a graph @xmath0 , let @xmath2 and @xmath14 denote the vertex - set of @xmath0 and the edge - set of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "for a subset @xmath15 , @xmath16 $ ] denotes the subgraph of @xmath0 induced by @xmath17 , and @xmath18 denotes the set @xmath19 .",
    "this set @xmath18 is called the _ open neighborhood _ of @xmath17 in @xmath0 .",
    "a subset @xmath20 is called a _",
    "vertex - cut _ of @xmath0 if there is a partition @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23}(x_i ) = \\emptyset ~ ( i=1,2)$ ] . for other basic definitions in graph theory ,",
    "please consult @xcite .    in 2008 , s. fujita and t. nakamigawa@xcite introduced a new graph invariant , namely the _ balanced decomposition number _ of a graph , which was motivated by the estimation of the number of steps for pebble motion on graphs .",
    "a _ balanced coloring _ of a graph @xmath0 means a triple @xmath1 of mutually disjoint subsets of @xmath2 such that @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "then a _ balanced decomposition _ of @xmath0 associated with its balanced coloring @xmath3 is defined as a partition of @xmath5 ( for some @xmath6 ) such that , for every @xmath7 , @xmath8 $ ] is connected and @xmath9 .",
    "note that every disconnected graph has a balanced coloring which admits no balanced decompositions .",
    "now the _ balanced decomposition number _ of a connected graph @xmath0 is defined as the minimum integer @xmath10 such that , for every balanced coloring @xmath3 of @xmath0 , there exists a balanced decomposition @xmath5 whose every element @xmath11 has at most @xmath10 vertices .",
    "the set of the starting and the target arrangements of mutually indistinguishable pebbles on a graph @xmath0 can be modeled as a balanced coloring @xmath3 of @xmath0 .",
    "then , as is pointed out in @xcite , the balanced decomposition number of @xmath0 gives us an upper - bound for the minimum number of necessary steps to the pebble motion problem , and , for several graph - classes , this upper bound is sharp .",
    "in addition to the initial motivations and their applications in @xcite , this newcomer graph invariant turns out to have deep connections to some essential graph theoretical concepts .",
    "for example , the following conjecture in @xcite indicates a relationship between this invariant and the vertex - connectivity of graphs :    the balanced decomposition number of @xmath0 is at most @xmath24 if @xmath0 is @xmath25-connected .",
    "recently , g. j. chang and n. narayanan@xcite announced a solution to this conjecture .",
    "then especially , s. fujita and h. liu@xcite proved the affirmation of the `` high''-connectivity counterpart of the above conjecture , as follows :    let @xmath0 be a connected graph with at least @xmath12 vertices .",
    "then the balanced decomposition number of @xmath0 is at most @xmath12 if and only if @xmath0 is @xmath13-connected .",
    "[ thmfl ]    thus , there may be a trade - off between the vertex - connectivity and the balanced decomposition number .",
    "this interesting relationship should be investigated for its own sake .",
    "unfortunately , the proof of theorem[thmfl ] in @xcite is lengthy ( about @xmath26 pages ) and complicated .    in this note",
    ", we give a new proof of the theorem[thmfl ] .",
    "the advantages of our proof is that it is immediate and makes clear a relationship between balanced decomposition number and graph matching .",
    "we show our proof of the theorem[thmfl ] here .",
    "then clearly , the balanced coloring @xmath3 of @xmath0 has a balanced decomposition @xmath5 whose every element @xmath35 consists of at most @xmath12 vertices , if and only if the graph @xmath27 has a perfect matching .",
    "then we use here the famous `` hall s marriage theorem''@xcite , as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be a bipartite graph whose partite sets are @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "suppose that @xmath38 . then @xmath0 has a perfect matching if and only if every subset @xmath39 of @xmath36 satisfies @xmath40 .",
    "[ hall ] now , suppose that @xmath27 does not have any perfect matching .",
    "then , from lemma[hall ] , @xmath41",
    ". let @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "then , by symmetry , @xmath44 also holds .",
    "furthermore , by the definition of @xmath27 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 hold , and hence @xmath47 which shows this situation .",
    "the vertex - cut of @xmath2 corresponding to the set @xmath48 separates @xmath49 $ ] from its remainder . by symmetry , the vertex - cut of @xmath2 corresponding to the set @xmath50 separates @xmath51 $ ] from its remainder . hence if @xmath0 is @xmath13-connected , @xmath52 , a contradiction .",
    "the proof of the * only if part * is given by a construction of special balanced colorings , which is the same as the original one in @xcite .",
    "we will transcribe the construction only for the convenience of readers .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is not @xmath13-connected . and let @xmath53 denote a minimum vertex - cut of @xmath0 .",
    "note that @xmath54 . then @xmath55 $ ]",
    "is divided into two graphs @xmath56 and @xmath57 such that @xmath58 and @xmath23}(v(g_i))=\\emptyset ~(i=1,2)$ ] . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 denote the number @xmath61 .",
    "suppose an arbitrary balanced coloring @xmath3 of @xmath0 such that @xmath62 and @xmath63 and @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "then , it is easy to see that every balanced decomposition associated with such a balanced coloring has at least one component whose vertex - size is at least @xmath66 , that is , the balanced decomposition number of @xmath0 is at least @xmath66",
