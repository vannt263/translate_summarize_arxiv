    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are ionized , gaseous envelopes ejected from intermediate - mass stars ( 1 - 8  m@xmath0 ) in the final stage of their evolution . at radio frequencies the dominant emission mechanism from ionised nebulae is bremsstrahlung ( or free - free radiation ) . due to the direct dependance of the bremsstrahlung emissivity on the square of the electron density the radio - continuum observations of pne are an important source of information concerning the overall physical structure and mass of the ionised gas .",
    "also , the radio brightness is especially effective as an evolutionary tracer due to its intrinsic dependence on the ionised gas density and the degree of ionisation . in the initial stage of the post - agb evolution",
    ", the radio flux density will be proportional to the number of ionising photons from the central star , while from the moment when the shell becomes fully ionised , the radio - evolution starts to be governed mostly by the expansion of the ionised gas .",
    "targeted radio - continuum observations of pne are usually based on optically identified objects .",
    "however , the effects of interstellar reddening , especially in directions where most pne are expected to be found ( eg . galactic plane and galactic bulge ) have strongly biased optically detected pne toward intrinsically radio brighter objects .",
    "the new macquarie / aao / strasbourg h@xmath1  ( mash ) catalogues of galactic pne ( gpne ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have increased by nearly 40% the known population of galactic pne , which now stands at nearly 3000 in total @xcite and made a major impact in the domain of pne with low and extremely low luminosities which were previously poorly represented .",
    "these significant discoveries derived from the innovative aao / ukst supercosmos h@xmath1 survey of the southern galactic plane ( shs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whose depth , arcsecond resolution , uniformity , and 4000 square degree areal coverage opened fresh parameter discovery space .",
    "key problems in pn research are some of the main aims of current and future studies of the mash team which will fully exploit this new large sample .",
    "these problems include the distance problem , unravelling the optical and radio - continuum pn luminosity function from significant new samples in the galactic bulge @xcite , understanding the quantitative differences in the multi - wavelength characteristics of pne @xcite and examination of correlations between evolutionary stage and observable properties of pne .",
    "the radio - continuum data form an important component in the multi - wavelength evolutionary scheme for this new large sample of galactic pne .",
    "it enables direct calculation of electron densities , degrees of ionization and interstellar extinction in the direction of pne . in this paper",
    "we present the newly compiled and complete database of radio - continuum detected mash pne .",
    "prior to the extensive radio - continuum survey of mash pne ( bojii et al . in prep . )",
    "only a handful of mash pne objects have been observed in pne - targeted radio - continuum surveys . , using the westerbork radio telescope ( wsrt ) and the very large array ( vla ) radio telescope , observed a large set of pn candidates selected from the iras point source catalogue and placed in the direction of the galactic bulge .",
    "the chosen sample is based on the far infrared selection criteria described in .",
    "the authors noted that approximately 20% of observed objects were detectable at 6  cm though not all of detected objects were confirmed pne . from that sample",
    "some eight objects have been recently identified as likely pn in shs h@xmath1  images and , after confirmatory optical spectroscopy , made their way into the mash catalogue .",
    "similarly , based on the [ siii]@xmath29532 survey of a 4@xmath34 degree field centred on the galactic centre , reported on @xmath4100 possible identifications of pne . for 63 pn candidates from this sample",
    "the obtained spectra appear consistent with highly reddened pn . using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) ,",
    "some 64 pn candidates were observed and 57 and 54 detected at 6 and 3  cm , respectively .",
    "the mash catalogue contains five pne observed in that survey from which only two have been positively detected in the radio - continuum .    on the other hand , several large - scale radio surveys like the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; *",
    "* ) , the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and its complementary molonglo galactic plane surveys ( mgps and mgps-2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the parkes - mit - nrao ( pmn ) survey @xcite have proven to be an excellent source of pne radio data .",
    "these surveys form the basis for this study .",
    "the nvss is a blind radio survey that covers @xmath5% of the sky north of @xmath6  =  40@xmath7 at 1.4  ghz ( 20  cm ) .",
    "the detection threshold limit is @xmath42.5  mjy ( for sources with angular size comparable with the fwhm of the produced synthesised beam ) with positional uncertainties of the order of 7  arcsec at the survey limit ( for sources brighter that 15  mjy the _ rms _ uncertainties are as low as 1  arcsec ) .",
    "the nvss is @xmath8% complete at flux densities above 5  mjy except near the galactic bulge , where , for the given flux threshold level , the catalogue completeness is estimated to be @xmath9% @xcite .",
    "for unresolved sources the incremental completeness is 50% at 2.5  mjy and it rises rapidly to 99% at 3.4  mjy .",

    "an additional 22 known pne and 122 pne candidates satisfying the ir colour criteria from have been presented in @xcite .",
    "another large data set of pne radio - continuum identifications in the nvss catalogue was presented in @xcite ( hereafter lcy05 ) .",
    "based on the first supplement to the strasbourg - eso catalogue of galactic planetary nebulae ( acker et al .",
    "1996 ) , pne catalogued in and on the set of 1047 positions from the preliminary mash catalogue they identified 315 correlated radio - continuum detections .    however , from 178 objects detected from the preliminary mash list , some 33 have been subsequently rejected as non - pn by the mash team prior to publication of the mash catalogue .",
    "additionally , the mash - ii supplement @xcite introduced a large set of pne which have not been previously correlated with the nvss catalogue .",
    "thus , an updated cleaned list of mash - nvss radio identifications and fluxes is presented here for the first time .",
    "similarly as in lcy05 , we first compared catalogued optical positions with nvss positions .",
    "cross - identifications between the two catalogues were considered as `` possible '' if the offset between the radio peak and the optical centroid was :    * less than 25  arcsec for objects with @xmath11  arcsec , * less than 1.2@xmath12 for objects with @xmath13  arcsec and",
    "* less than @xmath14 for objects with @xmath15  arcsec ,    where @xmath14 is the optically determined angular diameter in mash ( we will use this notation throughout this paper unless stated otherwise ) .",
    "all possible identifications were visually inspected using the finding charts ( approximately 7@xmath37  arcmin ) created from radio - continuum and h@xmath1  images .",
    "the 1.4  ghz images were obtained from the nvss postage stamp server .",
    "the updated list of positive nvss radio - continuum identifications now contains 201 mash pne .",
    "it includes 145 confirmed mash pne listed in lcy05 and additional 56 objects mostly from the mash - ii supplement .",
    "furthermore , 14 radio detections from the updated list have been flagged as suspect due to the larger offset of the radio - peak position from the optical centroid or because their radio counterparts are just below the threshold level and havent been picked up by the nvss cataloguing algorithm . in the later case",
    "we quote 2  mjy as a rough estimate of the flux density .",
    "all detected pne are presented in table  [ tab : nvssdetection ] .",

    "full comments are given in appendix  [ sec : notesonpne ] .",
    "in total , only about 25% of mash pne have been detected in the nvss . in this statistic",
    "we include all nvss `` detectable '' mash objects i.e. north of @xmath6  =  40  and with angular diameters smaller than 100  arcsec .",
    "off course , relatively bright objects , larger than 100  arcsec , are detectable in vla configurations used in the nvss @xcite . however , due to the generally low radio brightness of mash pne , we adapted 100  arcsec as a reasonable upper limit . in comparison with @xmath475% nvss detections of known pne ( ck98 )",
    "it is clear that the mash sample contains an intrinsically radio - fainter population at 1.4  ghz than previously observed .",

    "the initial comparison of radio - continuum properties between previously known and new mash pne detected in the nvss survey ( see fig .  [",

    "examine the radio - continuum properties of mash pne in comparison with the previously known part of the galactic pne population we compiled a comprehensive database of 5  ghz radio - continuum measurements of gpne from the literature .",
    "prior to this study two large databases of pne radio properties were given by @xcite and .",
    "also a number of studies used and extended these databases or presented new , refined samples , e.g. .",
    "all these samples were biased toward more accurate measurements which naturally arise from the more radio - bright pne . since mash pne clearly represents the low end of the pne radio brightness distribution it was very important to assemble the deepest possible set of flux densities for gpne for comparison .",
    "we restricted our search to 5  ghz ( 6  cm ) observations because at this frequency most pne are optically thin so the observed flux reflects the intrinsic physical properties of the ionised nebula ( assuming that a valid distance determination can be achieved ) .",
    "also , the expected background radiation is weaker than at lower frequencies and so the possible confusion with nearby sources is less ( this property is especially important for the data obtained via single - dish observations ) .",
    "these two assets of high frequency radio observations of pne are in fact the major reason why the majority of pne targeted surveys were performed at 5  ghz .",
    "we based our literature search on the catalogue of accurate positions of 1312 galactic pne originally listed in the strasbourg eso catalogue , its supplement and version 2000 of the catalogue of planetary nebulae as well as the new 2  kpc volume limited sample of @xcite ( hereafter f08 ) .",

    "since we found only a limited number of 5  ghz detections for mash pne we estimated 5  ghz flux densities from low frequency measurements ( i.e. from 1.4  ghz and 0.843  ghz flux densities reported in nvss and mgps-2 catalogues , respectively ) using equations  [ eq : simpspindex ] and [ eq : alpha_tb ] ( see   [ sec : prelspectr ] ) and adopting the canonical electron temperature of 10@xmath37  k for all mash pne .",
    "the adopted method accounts for the radio optical thickness effect only to some extent because it uses the same ( optically determined ) angular diameter in both the optically thick and optically thin regime .",
    "if a mash pn is detected in both the nvss and mgps-2 surveys we used the flux density from the 1.4  ghz observation .",
    "the calculated 5  ghz flux densities versus optically determined angular diameters , for some 210 radio - continuum detected mash pne are plotted with black dots .",
    "the difference in distances can be roughly seen from comparison of pne positions at lines of constant brightness temperature ( t@xmath38 ) .",
    "t@xmath38  is a distance independent evolutionary property of the evolving ionised nebulosity such that the changing distance to objects can only displace the position of an object in the @xmath34 diagram along a line of constant t@xmath38  . assuming a simple , constant expansion velocity of a spherically symmetric , constant density and fully ionised nebula , the optically thin flux density @xmath35 , at a distance @xmath39 , will be related to its angular diameter @xmath36 as @xcite :    @xmath40    in fig .",

    "it is important to note that the presented radio evolution of pne is clearly a strong simplification of the real picture .",
    "it does nt account for the optically thick phase ( t@xmath38@xmath41k ) , density and temperature gradients , and assumes an uniform expansion of a spherically symmetric and fully ionised nebular shell around the non - evolving central star ( cs ) . in the more realistic case the cs and nebular properties are changing mutually .",
    "the gas density stratification in a pn is far from constant and it will continue to change during the subsequent evolution because of the energy - input from the fast wind and due to the progress of the strong ionisation front throughout the neutral gas .",
    "thus , the optical depth at 5  ghz can be important in the initial stage of the pn evolution .",
    "also , the episode in cs evolution in turning to the `` cooling path '' could result in recombination in denser nebular regions and cause a drastic drop in the radio flux .",
    "however , the goal of this paper is not to provide a complete description of the radio - continuum emissivity from the evolving cs - pn system .",

    "[ fig : dbcomparison ] ) a clear separation between the local volume sample ( f08 ) and the rest of the galactic pne population can be seen supporting the general reliability of the @xcite distances . in the region above t@xmath38=100  k , evolutionary tracks for pne at 1  kpc and 2  kpc start to strongly diverge from the empirical distribution mostly because , as stated before , we used approximations of negligible self - absorption and fully ionised nebulae . the highly discrepant f08 object in figure  [ fig : dbcomparison ] is kjpn 8 @xcite .",
    "this very unusual object appears not to be a conventional pn ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) .",
    "the compact , pn - like core ( detected at 6  cm ) is surrounded by a very large , shock - excited , bipolar nebula , which has an emission measure too low to have been detected in extant radio surveys .",
    "the small core is very underluminous at both optical and radio wavelengths at the accepted distance of 1.6 kpc @xcite , falling off the h@xmath1 surface brightness ",
    "radius relation @xcite .",
    "more importantly , we can also see a gradual increase in the number of mash pne below t@xmath38@xmath42  k and with no mash objects with brightness temperatures above that value . if mash pne follow the same central star mass distribution as the rest of the gpne population then this implies that the mash samples do not contain ( at least not a significant number ) young pne and that radio `` faintness '' is strictly correlated to evolutionary properties .",
    "however , we can not eliminate the possibility that some of these nebulae are related to low - mass central stars ( @xmath43  m@xmath0 ) . in that case the ejected layers of gas could already be highly dispersed at the point when the central star increases the effective temperature enough to produce a significant number of photons in the lyman continuum .",
    "the starting point in the t@xmath38  evolution of these pne will be way below @xmath44  k as expected for `` normal '' pne .    the expected excess of the number of low brightness pne around 7.9  kpc can also be seen .",
    "obviously , the large density of mash pne along the 7.9  kpc evolutionary track is mostly caused by sampling bias . as we mentioned",

    "several , apparently `` true '' mash pne , show a steep negative radio - continuum spectra .",
