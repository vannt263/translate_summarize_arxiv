    "since t09 image the system only in h band , the companion s temperature and thus luminosity  remain observationally unconstrained .",

    "gj 758b is likely higher mass than 1rxs j162041 - 210524b @xcite and 2 m 1207b @xcite .",
    "gj 758b is consistent with being an older , cooler analogue to mid - l brown dwarfs in the pleiades ( e.g. brb29 ) studied by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and the recently discovered brown dwarf companion to pz tel , a 12 myr - old 1.3 m@xmath11 star @xcite .    for most of the gj 758b age range ,",

    "the more reliable age indicators , age - activity relations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , suggest that gj 758 at least as old as the sun , and perhaps as old as @xmath2 8.7 gyr ( t09 ) . thus , the mass of gj 758b is most plausibly comparable to that of low - mass brown dwarfs , not high - mass planets .",
    "we investigate the range of plausible orbital parameters with a monte carlo simulation following the method of t09 . with three astrometric points spanning one year ( figure [ astrom ] , left panel ) , the orbital properties of gj 758b are better constrained : only 1.2% of the trial orbital solutions `` fit '' the data compared to @xmath2 6% based on only the 2009 data ( t09 ) .",
    "the best - estimated eccentricity is high ( e@xmath30 @xmath2 0.73@xmath5 ) , and the best - estimated inclination indicates that the orbit is viewed neither pole on nor edge on(i@xmath30 @xmath2 50@xmath12@xmath31 ) .",
    "the best - estimated semimajor axis is @xmath2 44 au@xmath6 , or @xmath25 60% larger than its projected separation of @xmath2 28 au .",
    "our study recovers the detection of gj 758b reported by t09 and demonstrates that it has a red h - l color consistent with being an ultra - cool ( t @xmath25 560 k ) low - luminosity companion to a solar - type star .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the low end of the temperature range ( 550640 k ) quoted by t09 based on assuming that the cond models accurately reproduce the fluxes of substellar mass objects in each near - ir bandpass , although the allowed temperature range is about the same as that quoted by t09 , given our photometric errors .",
    "we also identify a second point source at a separation comparable to the putative ",
    "gj 758c \" companion reported by t09 , though its detection has a low significance and it is likely a residual speckle . however , if this is the same object as that previously reported , it is not in a bound orbit around gj 758 .",
    "based on the cond evolutionary models , gj 758b has a mass between @xmath2 10 m@xmath4 and 40 m@xmath4 .",
    "however , for most of gj 758 s age range , especially for ages derived from more reliable methods , its inferred mass is greater than the deuterium burning limit .",
    "thus , based on our analysis , it is then much more likely that gj 758b is a low - mass brown dwarf companion than a planet if `` planet '' is defined by an object s mass relative to the deuterium burning limit .    a separate , perhaps more physically motivated criterion for defining an object to be a `` planet '' is its formation history : whether or not it formed in a protoplanetary disk around a young star .",
    "sophisticated numerical models for planet formation @xcite necessary for testing formation theories have yet to be directly applied to systems with directly - imaged planets .",
    "however , analytical arguments show that forming gj 758b by core accretion is possible only if gas accretion is exceptionally efficient . using equation 14 from @xcite , the minimum surface density of solids required to trigger core instability within the lifetime of the disk",
    "is @xmath25 6@xmath1310@xmath32 g cm@xmath32 for a ( long ) protoplanetary disk lifetime of 5 myr @xcite .",
    "this surface density is comparable to that for @xcite s minimum mass solar nebula profile at our best fit semimajor axis of 44 au .",
    "once a core has formed , the isolation mass to which a non - migrating gas giant could grow is @xmath34 1020 m@xmath4 in disks containing that quantity of gas .",
    "however , accreting @xmath34 1020 m@xmath4 of gas in a disk that can not be more than @xmath2 100 m@xmath4 in mass total ( else the disk would be gravitationally unstable ) requires the planet to accrete very efficiently .",
    "companion formation by gravitational instability of the disk , in contrast , can only occur while the disk is still accumulating gas from the protostellar core , and preferentially forms companions with masses more similar to field brown dwarfs than jovian - mass planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "formation may also be possible earlier , during the fragmentation of the molecular cloud core that formed gj 758 : gj 758b would then comprise the low - mass end of the binary mass function .",
    "core fragmentation can probably produce objects much less massive than gj 758b ( e.g. 510 m@xmath4 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we consider this scenario to be a plausible one for forming gj 758b in addition to fragmentation during the protostar phase .",
    "future multiwavelength studies of gj 758b will better constrain its temperature and atmospheric properties . combined with improved age estimates derived from stellar rotation and activity , these data will better place gj 758b within the context of directly imaged low - mass brown dwarfs useful for investigating the mass function of objects approaching the deuterium burning limit .",
