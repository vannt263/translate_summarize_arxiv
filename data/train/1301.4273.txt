    "spectroscopic measurements are a powerful set of tools for probing various aspects of many - body physics.@xcite among these , auger electron spectroscopy ( aes ) provides information about the local atomic multiplet structure , on - site interaction strengths and the crystal fields.@xcite in transition metal oxides , the aes of the transition element can be supplemented by the o _ kll _ auger spectra , resulting in additional information about the o on - site repulsion energy as well as interactions between holes located on nearest - neighbor transition metal and o ions.@xcite such information is vital for understanding correlated materials , which is why aes has been the subject of sustained research for a long time .",
    "the auger process consists of the decay of a core hole into two final state holes ( initially located at the atomic site where the original core hole was created by the high energy x - ray ) plus an auger electron , and is mediated by onsite coulomb interactions .",
    "one of the most studied cases has these two final state holes residing in the valence band , and goes by the name of core - valence - valence ( cvv ) auger spectroscopy . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "the easiest case to handle has a full valence band except for the two auger holes .",
    "the central quantity of interest is the two hole green s function , which for an otherwise full band can be calculated within the two - step approximation using the cini - sawatzky theory.@xcite the resulting two hole spectral function , multiplied by momentum dependent matrix element factors , provides the theoretical predictions for aes.@xcite many extensions have been proposed to incorporate various aspects such as dynamical screening,@xcite off - site interactions,@xcite overlap effects,@xcite and one step formulation.@xcite we refer the reader to a recent review @xcite for more details .",
    "these efforts have led to spectacular success in explaining aes for materials such as cu and cu@xmath0o .    however , the problem of understanding aes for systems with a partially filled valence band , like the oxides of transition elements ni , co , fe , mn , etc .",
    ", remains open , because the two hole spectral function is very challenging to compute in this case .",
    "this is because in the presence of other holes , the dynamics of the two additional holes is a complicated many - body problem , whereas in an otherwise full band the two holes interact only with one another ( if we ignore electron - hole excitations between the valence and the conduction bands ) , i.e. this is a two - body problem .",
    "limited success has been achieved employing variants of the bare ladder approximations@xcite and assuming low hole density in the bands .",
    "a completely different approach is to use the anderson impurity approximation , whose underlying idea is as follows : in transition metal oxides , the transition metal atoms are typically connected to each other through oxygen ligands .",
    "the simplest example in one dimension is sketched in fig .",
    "[ f-1](a ) , and has transition metal atoms intercalated with o atoms . in the impurity",
    "approximation,@xcite the full problem is simplified to that of a single transition metal atom coupled to the bath of o , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ f-1](b ) .",
    "this greatly simplifies the calculation and is a reasonable step towards understanding local multiplet structures .",
    "however , because the symmetry of the problem is lowered , momentum - resolved spectral weights can not be calculated .",
    "[ f-1 ]    here , we propose a variational approach for finding the two - hole green s functions needed for aes , which can be thought of as an intermediary step between the impurity approximation and the full lattice calculation .",
    "like the former , it has a reduced hilbert space and can therefore be generalized to ( some ) systems with partially filled bands .",
    "like the latter , it has full translational invariance so that momentum - resolved spectral weights can be calculated .",
    "we argue that the location of the spectral weight component ignored within our approximation can be inferred apriorily but should be small for materials where aes is a useful probe .",
    "moreover , the variational space can be systematically enlarged to check the relevance of some of the neglected terms .",
    "in this paper we present the underlying idea and the general formalism of this variational approach , which is based on a recently developed method to calculate many - particle green s functions.@xcite here , we apply it to the simple model sketched in fig .",
    "[ f-1 ] and assume otherwise full bands , so that we can benchmark it against the exact solution available in this case . for completeness , we also show impurity approximation results for this model .",
    "this allows us to gauge the advantages and disadvantages of both these approximations and to understand for what regions in the parameter space they are valid .",
    "this information will guide us , in future work , to using this method for appropriate systems where the transition elements have partially filled @xmath1 orbitals .    the paper is organized as follows . in sections ii",
    "we define the hamiltonians and in section iii we discuss the methods to calculate two - hole propagators exactly and with the two approximations . in section",
    "iv we present the exact results and compare them with those predicted by our variational approximation as well as the impurity approximation for two different topologies of coupling between the impurity and the bath of o. section v contains the summary and conclusions .",
    "some of the details are presented in the two appendixes .",
    "the periodic 1d anderson model shown in fig .  [ f-1](a ) , is defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath2 where @xmath3 describes the tm atoms , which for simplicity are assumed to have only two ( spin - degenerate ) states each , and is given by : @xmath4 the o `` bath '' is described by a 1d hubbard model : @xmath5 while the tm - o hybridization is described by @xmath6.\\ ] ] here , all creation operators are electron creation operators , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 the operators for o and tm orbitals , respectively , with the convention that the i@xmath9 tm atom is placed to the left of the i@xmath9 o atom .",
    "as usual , @xmath10 . for book - keeping purposes we assume that there are @xmath11 tm and @xmath11 o sites , but in the final calculation we let @xmath12 .",
    "because the method we introduce below is based on a real - space representation , addition of longer - range interactions , such as repulsion between holes residing on neighboring tm and o sites , is trivial to implement .",
    "this model assumes that only the sigma - bonding o @xmath13 orbitals pointing towards the tm neighbors are relevant .",
    "generalization to models that include more o and/or tm orbitals , as well as lattices in higher dimensions , is discussed below .",
    "for aes in a system with full bands , we start from the completely full ground state @xmath14 of energy @xmath15 , and create two holes . because the periodic hamiltonian is invariant to translations and because we want to describe states where the two holes can be at the same site , we choose two - hole basis states with a total momentum @xmath16 and zero spin projection,@xcite namely @xmath17 if both holes are on tm sites , @xmath18 and @xmath19 if one hole is on a tm site and the other is at an o site , and finally @xmath20 if both holes are in the o bath . here",
    "@xmath21 is the lattice constant and @xmath22 takes all possible values consistent with the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "taken together , these states constitute a full basis for the hilbert subspace containing states with total momentum @xmath16 and zero spin projection .",
    "the aim is to find the propagator @xmath23 where @xmath24^{-1}$ ] is the resolvent for @xmath25 , because its associated spectral weight @xmath26 $ ] , which has poles at energies @xmath27 for any two - hole eigenstate with total momentum @xmath16 and energy @xmath28 , is proportional to the momentum - resolved spectral intensity measured by aes . as discussed below , our solution also provides the values of many other propagators beside @xmath29 , from which other useful information can be gleaned .",
    "the impurity approximation is a variational approximation where the holes are not allowed on any tm ions apart from the original one ; this is equivalent with excluding all such orbitals from the variational space . as a result",
    ", the full periodic problem is reduced to the anderson impurity problem sketched in fig .",

    "the filled - band ground state is now @xmath35 and its corresponding energy is @xmath36 . to calculate aes - relevant spectra we consider two - hole excitations in this ground state by removing two electrons with opposite spins .",
    "since invariance to translations is lost , the generic real space states of interest are now @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "now we are primarily interested in calculating the two - hole impurity green s function @xmath40 where @xmath41^{-1}$ ] , and its corresponding two - hole spectral function @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "we begin with the exact solution for the periodic anderson model . to find the propagator of interest to us , @xmath29 , we generate its equation of motion ( eom ) from the identity : @xmath43 . calculating its diagonal matrix element for @xmath44",
    ", we find :    @xmath45\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "in other words , because the hamiltonian links the state @xmath44 to states with one hole on a tm site and one on a neighboring o , the eom links @xmath29 to propagators corresponding to such states .",
    "their eom can be generated similarly , and we obtain an infinite sequence of coupled linear equations .",
    "to solve it , we couple the propagators with holes at the same distance @xmath48 in a vector : @xmath49 and note that for any @xmath50 , the eom can be grouped in the simple recurrence relation : @xmath51 for any given @xmath16 and @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are simple @xmath56 matrices that are read off directly from the eom .",
    "we note that one can always group the eom in such simple recurrence relations , even for models which allow longer - range hopping@xcite and/or in higher dimensions.@xcite for @xmath57 , the recurrence relation also has an inhomogeneous term : @xmath58 where @xmath59 for this problem .",
    "the solution of such recurrence relations has been discussed extensively elsewhere.@xcite briefly , we must have @xmath60 as @xmath61 , because the fourier transform of these propagators are the amplitudes of probability to have the two holes evolve from being on the same tm site to being @xmath48 sites away from each other , in a given time .",
    "as @xmath62 this becomes very unlikely , and the presence of the broadening @xmath63 which introduces an artificial lifetime @xmath64 makes it even less so . as a result , for @xmath65 we have @xmath66 where @xmath67^{-1}\\alpha_n$ ] is calculated starting with @xmath68 for a sufficiently large cutoff @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath70 we have @xmath71 where @xmath72^{-1}\\beta_n$ ] is calculated starting with @xmath73 .",
    "using @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the @xmath57 equation gives : @xmath76^{-1 } x.\\ ] ] this gives us @xmath29 as the top entry in @xmath77 .",
    "all other @xmath57 propagators , as well as those with @xmath78 , can also be then calculated efficiently .",
    "projecting on a different state than @xmath79 simply requires using a different @xmath80 , so other propagators can be found easily .    in principle , this method generalizes straightforwardly to lattices in any dimension and with any topology , so no approximations should be necessary . in practice , however , the computational cost quickly becomes prohibitive .",
    "for instance , for models with nearest - neighbor hopping in higher dimensions , one must group together in @xmath81 all propagators where the holes are separated by @xmath82 with @xmath83 , i.e. with the same manhattan distance.@xcite as a result , the dimension of @xmath81 increase roughly like @xmath84 .",
    "adding more orbitals at the tm / o sites will further amplify the problem , by increasing in a combinatorial fashion the number of possible propagators with the same @xmath85 separation . as a result , while the solution can still be cast in terms of continued fractions of matrices , their dimensions increase fast with @xmath48 resulting in significant computational costs .",
    "this is why efficient approximations are needed .    as already mentioned , one much - employed option is the impurity approximation .",
    "its solution for @xmath86 can also be formulated in terms of continued fractions of matrices ( we present the details in the appendix , since we are not aware of a prior similar solution for this problem ) .",
    "this approximation reduces the number of possible propagators by removing all but one tm site from the problem . as a result , there is now only one state with both holes at the impurity tm site as opposed to @xmath87 in the full periodic problem ( i.e. , including all allowed total momenta ) , and only @xmath88 combinations with one hole at the tm and one at an o site , as opposed to @xmath89 options in the full problem .",
    "the number of states associated with both holes in the o bath is not changed .",
    "the total number of distinct propagators is therefore reduced from @xmath90 in the full problem to @xmath91 in the impurity limit , suggesting that the latter is considerably more efficient .",
    "however , the full problem can be solved individually for each of the allowed @xmath11 total momenta , since the translational invariance guarantees that propagators with different momenta do not mix .",
    "thus , one needs to solve @xmath11 distinct problems with @xmath92 propagators each , as discussed above . in the impurity problem ,",
    "loss of translational invariance means that all propagators are coupled to one another through the eom . from this perspective",
    ", it is far less clear that using the impurity approximation is computationally more efficient , although to fully settle this one needs to take into account all other possible symmetries and the effects of the truncation ( for large system , the cutoff @xmath93 ) . in practice",
    "the o bath is often replaced by a featureless density of states ( we do not make this further approximation in our calculations ) .",
    "this certainly makes the impurity problem very efficient , but it also looses all information regarding the role of the o bath topology , on top of the loss of ability to momentum - resolve the aes spectral weights .    from this analysis ,",
    "it is clear that a better strategy would be to lower the total number of propagators while maintaining translational invariance .",
    "this is the basis for our proposed variational method .",
    "our proposal is to remove the propagators which have the holes at different tm sites .",
    "this is equivalent with excluding these states from the hilbert space , which is why this is a variational approximation .",
    "mathematically , this is easily achieved by setting @xmath94 for all @xmath50 in the eom discussed above , leading to vectors @xmath81 , @xmath95 of dimension 3 instead of 4 .",
    "of course , the saving is not big for this simple case , but it becomes considerable in higher dimensions and/or for more tm orbitals . because its variational space is significantly larger than that of the impurity approximation , this method is also guaranteed to be more accurate .",
    "physically , what this means is that both holes start at the same ( any ) tm site .",
    "eventually both hop into the o bath and move through the system , but whenever they happen to both hop back to tm sites they must go to the same tm ion . for systems with strong correlations ,",
    "i.e. where the states with the holes at the same tm site are at quite different energies from states with the holes as different tm sites , this should be a reasonable approach and is close to the intuitive picture of what happens in aes . in a way",
    ", one could view this as a `` lattice of impurities '' .",
    "besides maintaining translational invariance , this method has the added benefit that we can infer apriorily the effect of removing these states , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "moreover , if need be one can also systematically add some of these states back into the calculation  for example , starting with the states where the holes belong to neighboring tm sites only .",
    "their importance can therefore be assessed quantitatively .",
    "generalization to systems with partially filled tm orbitals is also less computationally costly than for the full solution .",
    "more discussion on the meaning and relevance of this approximation is presented below .",
    "we start by discussing the full periodic model .",
    "besides providing the test case against which we compare the variational and the impurity approximations , this also allows us to understand the various features of these spectra and their dependence on the various parameters .",
    "since the origin of some of these various features is model independent ( for example , the location of the continua in the aes spectrum is always obtained from the self - convolution of the one - hole spectrum ) , spectra with qualitatively similar features should be expected in more realistic models .    to understand the dependence of the aes spectral weight @xmath96 on the various parameters , we start by setting @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and varying @xmath99 .",
    "momentum - resolved results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for uniformly spaced values of @xmath16 from 0 to @xmath100 .    to make sense of these fairly complicated spectra",
    ", we note that these parameters correspond to a non - interacting system . as a result ,",
    "the two - hole spectra must be convolutions of single - hole spectra , which are easy to calculate ( note that single - hole spectra can also be obtained experimentally from angle - resolved photoemission ) .",

    "[ fig9 ] we briefly show the effect of adding on - site repulsion at the o sites in the impurity approximation .",
    "panel ( a ) is for the trivial topology while panel ( b ) is for the ring topology .",
    "the main effect of @xmath136 is to shift the continuum with one hole in the bath to lower energies by @xmath136 , as expected .",
    "this leads to a stronger hybridization with the discrete peak , which is consequently pushed to lower energies as well .",
    "the weights in these features also vary , but the two - hole continuum remains invisible on this scale .    to summarize , we find that the results for the two topologies are rather similar if @xmath156 and/or @xmath131 are large compared to @xmath157 ( if this is not the case , the impurity approximation is not valid ) . in this limit , the impurity approximation is quite successful in reproducing the location of the multiplet peak , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10n ] where we compare @xmath140 for the trivial topology ( dot - dashed line ) against @xmath158 for the exact solution ( full line ) and our variational approximation ( dashed line ) , for @xmath159 .",
    "the multiplet peak disperses very weakly for these parameters so all three curves show what looks like a discrete peak at low energies . as expected , the variational approximation provides a more accurate estimate of the peak position .",
    "the impurity approximation is also less successful in predicting the correct bandwidth for the continuum visible at higher energies ; when analyzing experimental data , this may result in wrong values assigned to the hopping parameters .",
    "[ fig10n ] confirms that our variational approximation is more accurate than the impurity approximation .",
    "in this work we introduced a novel variational approach to calculate two - hole green s functions needed for aes spectroscopy , and applied it to a simple 1d model with otherwise full bands , so that we can compare its predictions against the exact solution available for this case .",
    "we also calculated the results in the impurity approximation , for two different ways of connecting the impurity to the o bath .",
    "both approximations are reasonable to use only if the single - electron parameters are such that one - hole eigenstates with the hole primarily at the tm site ( i.e. , of tm character ) are energetically well separated from those with the hole primarily in the o band .",
    "if this is not true , then the basis states projected out in these approximations are energetically close to those kept within the calculation , and the results are not sensible .",
    "if the above mentioned condition is satisfied , our variational approximation is superior to the impurity approximation . not only",
    "does it produce momentum - resolved results , but the location of the continua that appear in the aes spectrum is in fair agreement with that expected from the convolution of the one - hole spectra , unlike for the impurity approximation .",
    "the superiority of our method can also be justified as follows : both methods are variational , since both limit the basis of allowed two - hole states .",
    "our method has a much bigger variational space , therefore it has to be more accurate .",
    "the results presented here confirm it .",
    "since the one - hole spectrum can be obtained from arpes measurements ( and , from a theoretical perspective , can be calculated with methods analogous to those we use here to find the two - hole propagator ) , a combination of the two spectroscopies can be used to determine which features in the two - hole spectrum come from this convolution .",
    "any other features must be due to on - site correlations , and can therefore help pinpoint the values of various on - site interaction energies .",
    "the method of ref . can be extended straightforwardly to compute green s functions for problems with three or more holes . as a result",
    ", it can certainly be used to solve impurity - type problems where the tm has a partially filled @xmath1 shell while the o band is completely full prior to the auger process .",
    "if the tm has a @xmath161 configuration , then after the auger process there are @xmath162 holes in the impurity problem .",
    "while computational times depend on @xmath48 and on how complicated the o bath is ( how many @xmath13 orbitals per o , and in what dimension ) , at least some of the higher @xmath48 cases should be solvable exactly .",
    "one can make further progress using the fact that processes where very many more than 2 holes hop into the o bath should be energetically very costly ( else , the ground - state would have partially filled o bands to begin with ) . as a result , one could systematically increase the number of holes allowed to hop into the bath starting from 2 , until convergence is reached . this may allow one to investigate all possible @xmath48 values within the impurity approximation , if convergence is reached fast enough .",
    "similar considerations apply to our variational method , because the total number of basis states it includes ( for each fixed value of @xmath16 ) is smaller but comparable to that for the impurity approximation . as a result ,",
    "one should get more accurate and momentum - resolved results at comparable computational costs .    of course , not all oxides have full o @xmath13 bands , although many do for at least some particular doping ( _ e.g. _ , an insulating parent compound ) . we envision using this method to extract information about crystal field splitting and on - site and nearest - neighbor interactions from auger spectroscopy on this compound . if further doping that results in partially filled o @xmath13 bands does not result in significant additional screening of these short - range interactions , then these values would be relevant over the entire doping range .    in conclusion , we believe that this method proposes an efficient way to make progress on understanding aes spectra for systems where the @xmath1 orbitals of the tm are only partially filled , so long as the states of tm character are not too close to the filled o states .",
    "such work is now in progress .",
    "this work was supported by nserc , cifar and qmi .",
    "for technical reasons which will become apparent soon , it is more convenient to group the tm together with the two o sites it directly hybridizes with into `` site '' 0 , and to index the o atoms to its right / left as @xmath163 , etc .",
    "the two o inside `` site '' 0 will be called `` a '' and `` b '' , respectively .",
    "this indexing is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] . amongst other things ,",
    "this indexing makes it easy to study the two situations depicted in figs . [ fig22](a ) and ( b ) , where the hopping between the two central o is turned off / on .",
    "we use the operator identity @xmath164 to generate eoms for the green s functions .",
    "for example , for any @xmath165 , this results in : @xmath166 , where @xmath167 .",
    "in other words , it links together propagators where the holes are at a distance @xmath168 apart , to propagators where the holes are @xmath169 sites apart .",
    "this allows us to rewrite these equations of motion as simple recurrence relations by grouping together in a vector @xmath81 all the propagators where the holes are @xmath48 sites apart .",
    "note that this is true for states with a hole at `` site '' 0 and one at any site @xmath170 , which also enter into @xmath81 and only link to propagators in @xmath171 .    to be more precise ,",
    "let : @xmath172 be a vector of infinite length which contains all the propagators with the holes @xmath48 sites apart .",
    "of course , there are three entries replacing the @xmath173 entry , corresponding to sites @xmath174 , and similarly for @xmath175 .",
    "further , we note that for @xmath65 , the ordering of the spins is preserved under hopping , since the left - most hole can not pass by the right - most hole with one hop .",
    "thus , we can write a recurrence relation for these vectors , for any @xmath65 , as : @xmath176 where @xmath53 , @xmath55 and @xmath54 are very sparse matrices , whose elements can be read off from the equations of motion as in the periodic case . further , as before , the tridiagonal form of the recurrence relation admits a continued fraction solution for these vectors .",
    "the rest of the procedure is the same as for the periodic case .",
    "_ truncation schemes of continued fractions : _",
    "\\(i ) for this method to work we need to truncate the continued fraction at a large inter - hole separation @xmath69 , both for the periodic and impurity cases . in the periodic system , we start out by creating two holes on a tm site .",
    "the two holes can now delocalize in the system .",
    "however , the broadening @xmath63 introduces a finite lifetime ( @xmath177 ) so that @xmath178 as @xmath179 .",
    "thus for a large enough @xmath180 , we can truncate the continued fraction for the v - vectors by setting @xmath181 to zero .",
    "for the impurity problem , this is justified because @xmath182 is the fourier transform of the amplitude of probability that the two holes move from the impurity ( tm ) site to the sites @xmath183 within a time @xmath184 .",
    "the larger @xmath48 is , the less likely this process becomes , hence the smaller these propagators must be .",
    "this is certainly true for the energy ranges spanned by eigenstates that favor having the holes on the impurity ( tm ) site , since then they are unlikely to wander very far away from it .",
    "however , this is also true even if the holes preferred the o bath .",
    "this is because the broadening @xmath63 is equivalent to introducing a finite lifetime @xmath177 for the holes , so they can not move arbitrarily far in a finite time @xmath184 .",
    "of course , in this latter case the appropriate cutoff @xmath69 increases as @xmath63 decreases . in practice , for both cases , we increase @xmath69 until the results become insensitive to further changes .",
    "\\(ii ) a further truncation is necessary for the impurity problem .",
    "this is because , with the ordering of the propagators used for the @xmath81 vectors , we have the additional complication that all these vectors , and therefore all the sparse matrices @xmath185 , are infinitely - dimensional . in order to calculate the continued fractions , we need to truncate the size of these vectors , as well .",
    "the reasons discussed above justify doing this if either @xmath186 and/or @xmath187 .",
    "we use the following truncation procedure : for a fixed separation @xmath48 between the holes , the maximum distance either of the two holes is allowed to travel away from the tm is @xmath188 , _",
    "i.e. _ , we truncate @xmath189 at @xmath190 at the top and @xmath191 at the bottom .",
    "again , @xmath192 is increased until results become independent of its value . as a final comment",
    ", we note that there are other ways of grouping the propagators into vectors so that the equations of motion still lead to a simple recursive relation .",
    "different schemes have various computational advantages and disadvantages , but they all convergence to the correct answer if the cutoffs are sufficiently large .",
    "this converged result is equivalent to the exact solution computed by the cini - sawatzky theory for the anderson impurity problem .",
    "for simplicity , we discuss the impurity approximation first , and the full periodic system second .    for the impurity approximation , if we ignore the tm - bath hybridization , @xmath193 , then if both holes are at the tm site the energy of the state is @xmath194 ; if one hole is at the tm site and one is in the o bath , the minimum energy of such states is @xmath195 .",
    "finally , if both holes are in the o bath , the minimum energy of such states is @xmath196 . as a result ,",
    "the state with both holes at the tm atom is favorable energetically if @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "the second condition is automatically satisfied if the first one holds , since the tm on - site interaction is repulsive , @xmath199 .",
    "the condition @xmath197 implies that aes should be more useful for mott insulators than for charge transfer materials.@xcite to see this , consider one - electron removal states from the gs . if the hole is removed from the tm site , the energy of the state is @xmath200 , while if it is removed from an o site , the minimum energy is @xmath201 .",
    "the latter is energetically more expensive than the former if @xmath197 .",
    "this makes sense , because if the material was a charge transfer insulator the additional holes would prefer to stay in the o bath and aes would be less sensitive to the tm atom specific properties .",
    "the analysis for the periodic system is very similar for @xmath193 , because the energy differences between states having ( i ) both holes at the same tm site , ( ii ) one hole at a tm site and one in the o bath , and ( iii ) both holes in the o bath , are precisely the same as for the impurity case .",
    "because of this and also in order to be able to meaningfully compare with impurity approximation results , we use the same parameters in both cases .",
    "note that in the periodic system we can also have ( iv ) the two holes at different tm sites . for @xmath115 , these states",
    "has energy @xmath202 and are always energetically favored compared to having both holes at the same tm site .",
    "of course , these are the states projected out in our variational calculation ."
