    "the higgs sector @xcite of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite is still experimentally untested , and so far only a lower bound on the mass of the higgs boson ( @xmath1 gev ) has been obtained @xcite .",

    "accurate predictions of the branching ratios of these particles are needed in order to facilitate the searches at future colliders , and the present work considers decays of a higgs boson to a lighter higgs boson and a virtual vector boson .",
    "we shall be focusing on the two  higgs  doublet  model ( 2hdm ) , and how the presence of these three  body decays may affect the current search techniques .",
    "some attention will be also given to a general model with @xmath4 doublets , which we shall call the multi ",
    "doublet  model ( mhdm )",
    ". one particular form of the 2hdm has received substantial attention in the literature , mainly due to the fact that it is the structure of the minimal supersymmetric extension ( mssm ) of the sm @xcite . however , there are four variants of the 2hdm which differ in how the doublets are coupled to the fermions @xcite ( we are concerned with natural flavour conservation ) . in ref .",

    "the production channel @xmath125 would then proceed with a rate close to that of the sm higgs , and the subsequent decay @xmath126 would give the signature @xmath127 and @xmath85 in opposite hemispheres .",

    "@xcite and @xcite ( where @xmath144 and @xmath145 refer to a higgs and a vector boson ) contains a typing error , which is corrected by changing the final term @xmath146 to @xmath147 .",

    "the difference in mass between @xmath103 and @xmath75(@xmath74 ) is important since it determines how off  shell the vector boson is , and so the curves for lower @xmath103 take longer to reach @xmath155 . in fig .",

    "if @xmath12 is not fermiophobic then one could have final states of 8 fermions , with four of them likely to be @xmath87 quarks .",
    "such a signature might allow detection of @xmath3 in the difficult @xmath171 region , although a full analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .      in model  i@xmath5 the three  body decay can only be strong only at small @xmath34 , which we can see from fig .",

    "as @xmath187 increases the fermion decays start to gain in importance , and so all the curves fall to small values ; those curves with larger @xmath75 do not fall as sharply since their partial width is larger .",
    "of course , one may choose @xmath75 and @xmath74 such that the on  shell decay @xmath214 is open .",
    "for these choices of higgs masses the decay @xmath90 would always be open ( since @xmath215 ) and so one would expect the 6 fermion signature to dominate the 4 fermion signature .      in both these models the fermions",
    "never decouple completely from @xmath12 , and so we expect lower maximum brs for the three  body decay .",
    "in addition there will be a strong @xmath34 dependence . in model  i@xmath5",
    "we find a peak br@xmath216 ( @xmath217 ) for @xmath218 , with @xmath219 gev . in model",
    "ii these values drop to @xmath195 and @xmath220 respectively .",
    "these decays have not been considered so far in the searches for @xmath37 of the general 2hdm , and if open may be of great importance in model  i. the phenomenology of @xmath37 in model  i and model  ii has been considered in the context of the lhc @xcite , but this work did not consider three ",
    "body decays , and was concerned with a more massive @xmath37 which could decay to on ",
    "shell @xmath222 .",
    "the condition for a light @xmath12 causes @xmath149 , and so in this case the production cross - section @xmath182 would be not mixing angle suppressed .",
    "we now consider the strength of the decay @xmath223 in models  i , i@xmath5 and ii .      in fig .",
    "7 we plot br@xmath223 for 3 values of @xmath74 , fixing @xmath224 gev .",
    "we require @xmath225 gev ( from lep1 searches ) , and deliberately consider mass choices which make @xmath0 off  shell in order to emphasize that the off  shell decays can be prominent .",

    "7 that @xmath168 is not light enough to cause a competing three  body decay . from fig .  7",
    "one can see the importance of the decay @xmath221 when open , and it would be an alternative way of producing a light @xmath8 with a good rate . the signature would be similar to that discussed in section 5.1.1 , although in this case there would be less jets .    comparing fig . 7 with fig . 3",
    "one sees a significant difference in the strength of the respective lines for @xmath227 gev and @xmath228 gev , the former starting at br@xmath229 and the latter at br@xmath195 .",
    "there are two reasons why the three  body decay for @xmath72 is stronger than that for @xmath37 , for identical masses of the higgs bosons in the decay , despite the fact that the @xmath0 mediated decay has a slightly stronger coupling by a factor of @xmath230 .",
    "firstly , the fact that @xmath231 means that @xmath0 would be more off ",
    "shell in the decay @xmath232 than @xmath233 in the decay @xmath234 .",
    "secondly , and more importantly , br@xmath235 is strongly suppressed by the ckm matrix while the decay @xmath236 is normally the dominant decay for @xmath37 .      in fig .",
    "8 we plot the analogy of fig .  7 for model  i@xmath5 .",
    "we find a similar @xmath34 dependence to that found for @xmath237 in fig .",
    "4 , with a decrease in the br as @xmath34 increases .",
    "the curve with @xmath238 gev allows the two  body decay @xmath226 , and maintains a large br until @xmath34 becomes very large .    in model  ii one may consider the decay @xmath232 , although since @xmath54 gev in this model the @xmath91 parameter constraints ( see fig .",
    "1 ) suggest that requiring a light @xmath12 would cause @xmath74 to be out of the range of lep2 . for this reason we do not plot a graph .",
    "even if one allowed @xmath74 in range at lep2 the three  body decays would be very small , this being due to the fact that the decay width for @xmath236 is proportional to @xmath173 in model  ii .",
    "if an on  shell @xmath0 is allowed ( e.g. @xmath238 gev , @xmath224 gev ) one finds br(@xmath239 at @xmath188 , falling below @xmath217 at @xmath240 .",

    "9 ( for model  i ) we vary @xmath74 from @xmath242 gev , setting @xmath243 gev .",
    "we do not consider values of @xmath244 gev , since we require that the production process @xmath245 be open , and also that @xmath246 so that there are no competing @xmath232 decays .",
    "we see that this channel can be dominant at larger values of @xmath34 . for model  i@xmath5 with @xmath247 gev the br peaks at @xmath195 , and falls to below @xmath217 for @xmath248 ( we do not plot a graph ) .",
    "we now consider the @xmath3 of the mhdm and aim to give a more detailed analysis of a detection channel mentioned in our earlier work .",
    "if no neutral higgs boson exists with a mass lighter than @xmath103 the brs of @xmath3 in model i and i@xmath5 will be given by the entries in table 3 .",

    "these values drop to @xmath252 gev and @xmath253 gev , and so our previous results slightly overestimate br@xmath14 .",
    "however , it will still be possible to have a large br@xmath14 @xmath254 ) if @xmath255 by a factor of 5 or so .",
    "a review of the detection techniques for a light @xmath3 at lep2 appears in ref .",
    "the three signatures analysed were @xmath256 , @xmath257 and @xmath258 . in the mhdm",
    "one could consider the signature @xmath259 , which would give an isolated @xmath177 and missing energy recoiling against a hadronic system with a tagged @xmath87 quark .",
    "much of the selection criteria would be identical to that of the @xmath257 channel . in the @xmath257 channel",
    "the @xmath260 background is removed by reconstructing the invariant masses of the @xmath70 and @xmath71 systems , thus significantly reducing this background if @xmath148 .",

    "@xcite we showed that the presence of a large br@xmath14 ( of order @xmath268 is possible ) in a mhdm has two potential uses :    * it would suggest that a detected @xmath3 is from the mhdm , since the equivalent decay in model  i and model  i@xmath5 has a br less than @xmath217 .",
    "* it may allow a chance detection in the difficult @xmath265 region since @xmath51 rarely decays to @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath259 channel has the advantage of almost negligible background from @xmath267 and @xmath263 events , as long as one can correctly identify the @xmath87 quark .",
    "in addition we will be able to use the selection criteria of the @xmath257 channel , replacing the invariant mass cut with a @xmath87tag requirement .",
    "the number of signal events ( before cuts ) in the @xmath259 channel is given by : @xmath269 where @xmath270 is the number of pair produced @xmath3 events , and @xmath271 is defined by @xmath272 in order to isolate these final states @xmath87tagging will be necessary .",
    "since this a standard technique for searching for the sm higgs at lep2 , the efficiency , @xmath273 , will be quite high ( @xmath274 ) in practice , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite . for the @xmath259 channel we shall use the optimistic values br@xmath275 which maximizes @xmath271 .",
    "we note that in the @xmath257 channel the invariant mass cut was the last cut applied , and all other non@xmath267 backgrounds had already been removed .",
    "when it is applied for the mass region @xmath171 it will remove the signal as well .",
    "our aim is to replace this latter cut with a @xmath87tag requirement , which will reduce the @xmath267 background to negligible proportions while preserving most of the signal .",
    "one would need to have a strong rejection against fake tags coming from @xmath276 quarks . from the figures in ref .",
    "@xcite one can infer that the invariant mass cut reduces the higgs signal by @xmath277 .",
    "therefore we shall assume a selection efficiency ( @xmath278 ) before @xmath87tagging of @xmath279 for the higgs signal , obtained by scaling the value of @xmath261 in table 5 .",
    "one can obtain the following formula for the number of signal events @xmath280 in the @xmath259 channel : @xmath281 the number of @xmath259 events from @xmath267 production is 1.1 _ before _ any cuts have been applied .",
    "the cuts before the @xmath87tag requirement have a selection efficiency considerably below @xmath154 and therefore the background is entirely negligible .",
    "we stress that we require strong @xmath276 quark rejection since the number of events in the @xmath257 channel is large .",
    "we then require 3 or more signal events for detection , and we see from the eq .",
    "( 12 ) that the number of events for @xmath227 gev and @xmath282 gev is equal to 2.1 .",
    "therefore detection is certainly marginal . at the higher collider energy , @xmath283  gev , due to larger @xmath270 we find that @xmath284 .",
    "all this analysis is with optimistic choices for @xmath273 and @xmath285 . with greater luminosity , which would be available at a next generation collider one could probe a greater parameter space of @xmath285 .    in summary",
    ", the @xmath259 channel at lep2 only provides a slight chance of overcoming the difficult @xmath286 region in the mhdm , since the largest values of @xmath285 would be needed .",
    "however , the signature would have a use for @xmath103 lighter than @xmath287 since it would provide evidence of the mhdm .",
    "for @xmath103 comfortably below @xmath287 a reasonable number of @xmath3 pairs would be produced and we shall require three tagged @xmath259 events to conclude that a detected @xmath3 originates from the mhdm . from eq .",
    "( 12 ) we can obtain eq .",
    "( 13 ) from which the values of @xmath285 needed to produce the distinctive signature of three tagged @xmath259 events can be found .",
    "@xmath288 thus for @xmath289 ( corresponding to @xmath290 gev at @xmath282 gev )",
    ", one finds @xmath291 , and so br@xmath292 is required . for lower masses br@xmath293 ( or even less ) would be sufficient .",
    "we note that for the 2hdm that the analogous signal would be @xmath294 events , which is unobservable .    another way of distinguishing @xmath3 of the mhdm would be through a lack of @xmath172 decays i.e. leptophobia with br@xmath295 ) . from table 1",
    "one sees that br(@xmath172 ) is expected to be large in both model  i and i@xmath5 ( @xmath296 and @xmath297 respectively ) , while in the mhdm it can be reduced to much lower values .",
    "for example , a simple calculation shows ( not including @xmath68 decays ) @xmath298 therefore if @xmath299 , one finds br(@xmath300 . including the @xmath68 decays would reduce this further , and so it is apparent that a sizeable parameter space exists for br(@xmath301 . for the extreme case of br@xmath302",
    "one would find a ninefold increase in the number of events in the @xmath303 channel compared to model  i.",
    "we have studied the impact of three  body decays of a higgs boson to a lighter higgs boson and a virtual vector boson in the context of the non ",
    "supersymmetric 2hdm model .",
    "such decays have been studied in the mssm , although their importance is magnified in the four versions of the general 2hdm , partly due to the lack of correlation among both the mixing angles and masses of the higgs scalars , and partly due to the different couplings of the higgs bosons to the fermions .",
    "such decays would allow the production of light neutral higgs bosons which have so far escaped detection at lep due to suppressed couplings to the @xmath0 boson .",
    "we showed that the three  body channels , if open , can be of great importance in model  i , permitting the decays @xmath304 and @xmath305 to proceed with large branching ratios over a wide range of @xmath34 values . as @xmath34 increases @xmath3 and @xmath37 decouple from the fermions and so the three  body channels rapidly grow in importance , ultimately reaching branching ratios close to @xmath154 .",
    "these results have important applications for the phenomenology of model  i at lep2 , particularly for @xmath3 which may avoid the present search techniques which assume charged scalar decays to @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "we suggested that the three  body decays might also allow detection of @xmath3 in the difficult @xmath168 region . a fermiophobic higgs boson ( only possible in model  i ) which has so far escaped direct searches in the @xmath306 channel",
    "may be produced copiously in the decay of @xmath3 or @xmath37 , provided that enough of the latter are produced on  shell .",
    "signatures with 3 or 4 photons would be possible , which would pass current @xmath8 search criteria with equal or better efficiencies , and enable discrimination from the @xmath306 signal .",
    "for the cp  even @xmath12 the three  body decays @xmath180 and @xmath200 may be dominant at low values of @xmath187 and allow a 6 fermion signature even when the decay @xmath90 is not open .    in model",
