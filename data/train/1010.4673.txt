    "this article is about the properties of a quantum statistical ensemble , which is , in a sense , opposite to the conventional micro - canonical ensemble .",
    "it is an extension of the previous work of one of us@xcite .",
    "the present work contains a discussion of underlying conceptual issues and detailed analytical and numerical investigations of finite quantum systems .",
    "these two aspects of the article are complementary but otherwise quite different in scope and style",
    ". sections  [ narrow ] and [ prospects ] are dealing with conceptual issues .",
    "they motivate and outline a broader agenda . the remaining sections ( [ qmc]-[spins ] plus appendices )",
    "are more specialized .",
    "we hope that the conceptual part would motivate the readers unfamiliar with the above agenda to look into the rest of the article .",
    "the standard quantum - mechanical derivation of boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) equilibrium is based on the conventional micro - canonical postulate formulated as follows .",
    "one should consider a subsystem in a macroscopic environment , assume , that the two form an isolated macroscopic system , neglect the interaction between them , and then select the statistical ensemble amounting to an incoherent mixture of eigenstates of the total system in a narrow energy window around a given value of energy , @xmath0 .",
    "the width of this micro - canonical energy window @xmath1 should be large enough to include a very large number of quantum levels , but , at the same time , small enough to imply the negligible change of temperature across this energy window .",
    "this condition can be formally expressed as follows : @xmath2 and @xmath3 \\over \\partial e } \\right\\vert_{e = e_{\\hbox{\\scriptsize av } } } \\gg - \\delta_{mc } \\left .",
    "{ \\partial^2 \\hbox{log } [ \\nu(e)/\\nu_0 ] \\over \\partial e^2 } \\right\\vert_{e = e_{\\hbox{\\scriptsize av}}}. \\label{t}\\ ] ] here @xmath4 is the density of energy states of the isolated macroscopic system , which should be approximately equal to the density of states of the environment at the same energy , @xmath5 is unimportant normalization constant , and @xmath6 is temperature in energy units .",
    "given the exponentially large number of levels of a macroscopic system , the above two inequalities can be easily satisfied for @xmath1 ranging over many orders of magnitude .",
    "recently , further progress was made by showing that a single pure state of a macroscopic system formed by a coherent superposition of eigenstates randomly selected from the above energy window would also lead to a density matrix of the subsystem exhibiting the bg distribution@xcite .",
    "it has been further conjectured that , if the isolated macroscopic system is chaotic in the classical limit , then even a single eigenstate would lead for the bg distribution in the density matrix of the subsystem@xcite .",
    "yet the question remains : what is the justification of the narrow energy window in the microcanonical postulate ?",
    "the origin , the limits and the implications of this condition are not well understood at present .    the microcanonical postulate as such remains a rather formal construction , because in reality we do not encounter macroscopic systems isolated from the rest of the world .",
    "even , if we were to find one , the non - relativistic quantum - mechanical description of such a system normally leads to unrealistically small spacings between adjacent eigenstates  much smaller than the minimal natural width of an energy level estimated as @xmath7 , where @xmath8s is the big - bang age of the universe .",
    "the real width of the energy levels should , of course , be much larger due to relativistic effects .",
    "although the notion of an energy eigenstate of a macroscopic system is not well - defined , one can still hope that the statistical treatment based on this notion would produce an outcome , whose validity extends beyond the systems with well - defined energy eigenstates  in the same way as bg statistics derivable for classical systems extends to quantum systems .",
    "considering systems with well - defined eigenstates , one can proceed by giving the conventional microcanonical ensemble with its narrow energy window the status of a fundamental postulate .",
    "however , such an approach to justifying bg equilibrium is not quite satisfactory .",
    "if instead of simply postulating the bg equilibrium for quantum systems , one were to claim its derivation from a more fundamental postulate , then the introduction of this extra postulate would be justified only if , in addition to the bg equilibrium , it would lead to an explanation of some other previously unexplained facts about nature and predict new ones .",
    "the micro - canonical postulate , however , does not lead to any other observable prediction besides bg equilibrium itself .",
    "it could have been that the narrow energy condition is only a simplification , while the bg distribution emerges for a broader class of ensembles .",
    "however , as discussed in refs.@xcite , the departure from the narrow energy condition easily spoils the bg statistics for a subsystem .",
    "it leads to a mixture of different thermal distributions , which does not produce a distribution characterized by a single temperature .",
    "yet one could have asked the question : if it is not a narrow energy window , then what is the most likely shape of the participation function for the energy eigenstates of the entire system ?",
    "can it be that , if the most likely shape is found , then the resulting statistics for the subsystems is of bg type ?",
    "one can , in particular , recall that the conventional canonical ensemble does not appear to have narrow energy window for participating eigenstates . to each eigenstate with energy @xmath9 ,",
    "it assigns probability weight @xmath10 , which follows either from maximizing entropy @xmath11 subject to the total energy constraint , or from the practical consideration that , if one slowly isolates a large quantum system from its environment , which initially was in bg equilibrium with temperature @xmath12 , then the diagonal elements of the resulting density matrix will have the above form . here",
    ", it should be noted , however , that the quantity of practical interest in not the probability weight function @xmath13 as such but rather its product with the density of states @xmath14 .",
    "since @xmath13 decays exponentially with constant  rate `` @xmath15 , while for a macroscopic system @xmath4 increases exponentially with decreasing ' ' rate \" @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is defined by eq.([t ] ) , the product would have a narrow maximum at energy @xmath18 corresponding to @xmath19 . the width of that maximum @xmath20 is determined by @xmath21 \\over \\partial e^2 } \\right\\vert_{e = e_{\\hbox{\\scriptsize av } } } =   \\left .",
    "{ \\partial [ 1/t(e ) ] \\over \\partial e } \\right\\vert_{e = e_{\\hbox{\\scriptsize av } } }   \\sim - { 1 \\over t_0 ^ 2 n_p } , \\label{plog}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the number of particles in the system .",
    "this gives @xmath23 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath24 \\over \\partial e^2 } \\right\\vert_{e = e_{\\hbox{\\scriptsize av } } } \\sim { 1 \\over t_0 \\sqrt{n_p } } \\ll { 1 \\over t_0 } , \\label{dlog}\\ ] ] i.e. condition ( [ t ] ) is satisfied .",
    "thus the canonical ensemble for an isolated macroscopic quantum system , in effect , imposes a narrow energy window condition .    the idea of maximization entropy at a given energy is closely related to the notion of chaos and ergodicity in the phase space of classical systems . for quantum systems , the notion of phase space trajectories is not defined because of the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "hence the maximization of conventional entropy can not be justified on the basis of the dynamics of isolated quantum systems .",
    "to address the issue of what may happen beyond the narrow energy window imposed by the conventional ensembles , an ensemble with unrestricted participation of eigenstates and without the requirement of the maximization of conventional entropy , referred to below as quantum micro - canonical ensemble@xcite , is a conceptually necessary limit to consider .",
    "( similar quantum canonical ensembles have also been defined refs.@xcite . )    in addition to the above conceptual issues , the basic concern in the context of the foundations of quantum statistical physics remains about the actual behavior of an isolated quantum system perturbed from equilibrium and not interacting with a large thermal bath .",
    "it is overwhelming intuition of many researchers , including the present authors , that an isolated macroscopic classical system with generic non - linear interaction between particles would evolve dynamically to exhibit the bg statistics for small subsystems .",
    "the situation is , however , not so trivial for quantum systems , because they can be in a superposition of states having different total energies .",
    "if , after the perturbation , an isolated quantum system is in a broad superposition of eigenstates violating the narrow energy condition , then the occupations numbers of eigenstates will not change with time under the dynamics guided by linear schrdinger equation , and hence the narrow energy condition will never emerge .",
    "generic wave function @xmath25 of a quantum system is a superposition of eigenstates @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 are complex amplitudes , and @xmath29 the total number of eigenstates . for an isolated quantum system ,",
    "fixing energy @xmath0 associated with wave function @xmath25 implies @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the occupation numbers of quantum eigenstates , and @xmath32 are the corresponding energies .",
    "we shall refer to @xmath0 as `` average energy '' [ not to be confused with the uniform average of all @xmath32 ] .",
    "in this work , we focus on quantum micro - canonical ( qmc ) ensemble@xcite , where all quantum wave functions satisfying average energy constraint ( [ epsav ] ) are equally probable in the hilbert space of the system .",
    "the qmc ensemble amounts to a natural generalization of the equipartition postulate for energy shells in classical phase spaces . despite this analogy ,",
    "the qmc ensemble is quite different from the conventional micro - canonical ensemble , because it does not limit the participating eigenstates to a narrow energy window around @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that the qmc ensemble does not lead to the bg statistics , at least in the absence of interaction between the subsystem and the environment .",
    "this negative result is important , because it forces one to think seriously about justifying the narrow energy window in the conventional microcanonical ensemble .",
    "as discussed in refs.@xcite and in section  [ prospects ] , quantum collapse may play here a fundamental role .",
    "further study of the qmc ensemble is also important , because this ensemble may be realizable in small isolated quantum systems with a large number of quantum levels .    beyond the subject of foundations of quantum statistical physics , the properties of the qmc ensemble are also relevant to the studies of various properties of hilbert spaces , e.g. in the context of quantum computing or many - particle entanglement .",
    "it is finally plausible on general grounds that such a natural quantum ensemble would find many realizations not discovered so far .",
    "for example , it was demonstrated in ref.@xcite that the expansion of the basis states of sparce random matrices in terms of eigenstates exhibits the qmc type of statistics .",
    "the description of the qmc ensemble involves two steps : ( 1 ) characterization of the shape of the energy window function  in this case , the participation function for the eigenstates of the entire isolated system ; and ( 2 ) obtaining the density matrix for the subsystem of interest .",
    "sections  [ general]-[results ] below deal with step ( 1 ) , while section  [ spins ] deals with step ( 2 ) .    in section  [ general ] ,",
    "we summarize the analytical results obtained in ref.@xcite for the qmc ensemble in large-@xmath29 isolated quantum systems . in section  [ ansatz ] ,",
    "we propose a method of introducing finite-@xmath29 corrections to the large-@xmath29 approximation . in section  [ results ] , we present the numerical tests of the resulting description for a 12-level isolated quantum system . in section",
    "[ spins ] , we examine numerically the density matrix for a subsystem of a 12-level system , and compare the qmc - based result with that of the conventional canonical ensemble .",

    "[ algorithmmc ] gives the details of our monte - carlo sampling algorithm for the qmc ensemble .",
    "we consider quantum spectum @xmath34 consisting of @xmath29 energy levels .",
    "the values of energies are assumed to be ordered with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    the analytical approach and",
    "the analytical results of ref.@xcite can be described as follows .",
    "the qmc ensemble is defined by specifying uniform joint probability distribution for complex amplitudes @xmath37 in the hilbert space  subject to average energy constraint ( [ epsav ] ) and to the normalization constraint @xmath38 the two constraints are of the second order in variables @xmath39 and do not depend on @xmath40 .    to avoid dealing with curved manifolds , we now change from variables @xmath39 to variables @xmath31 .",
    "completely random choice of states in hilbert space implies that the probability measure is proportional to the volume element : @xmath41 since constraints ( [ epsav ] , [ norm ] ) do not depend on @xmath40 , the assignment of variables @xmath40 is totally random .",
    "the resulting uniform distribution of @xmath40 can be just factorized out and then integrated .",
    "what remains is the euclidean subspace of variables @xmath42 with uniform joint probability measure on the manifold constrained by conditions ( [ epsav ] , [ norm ] ) together with the positivity condition @xmath43 in the @xmath42-space , due to the linear nature of constraints ( [ epsav],[norm],[positiv ] ) , the boundaries of the resulting manifold are flat , i.e. the manifold itself is an @xmath44-dimensional polyhedron",
    ". we will refer to it as `` qmc polyhedron '' .",
    "our goal is to obtain marginal probability distribution @xmath45 for a given occupation number @xmath46 and the corresponding average value @xmath47 representing the participation of the @xmath48th eigenstate in the qmc ensemble .",

[ for finite-@xmath29 systems , the actual behavior of @xmath53 can exhibit noticeable deviations from the exponential dependence of eq.([vkpk1 ] ) ] .    behind the geometry - based discussion one should not overlook that eq.([vkpk1 ] ) represents grand - canonical gibbs ensemble defined in the hilbert space , or the space of occupation numbers @xmath46 .",
    "the problem is , in fact , equivalent to finding the probability distributions for a system of @xmath29 classical states characterized by one - particle energies @xmath68 , with @xmath46 being the number of classical particles occupying the @xmath48-th state .",
    "in such a problem both the total energy and the total number of classical particles is conserved , which leads to the grand canonical ensemble in the hilbert space .",
    "this analogy , however , does not imply conventional observable results , because it pertains to the probability distribution @xmath45 , while , in the original quantum problem , @xmath46 itself is the probability of observing the system in the @xmath48th state , i.e. the prediction of the observable outcome requires finding the average value @xmath47 .",

    "is it further realistic to expect that the qmc ensemble can be realized in an isolated macroscopic quantum system that has once experienced quantum collapse ? for a truly macroscopic system consisting of @xmath215 weakly interacting parts , the answer to both questions appears to be `` extremely unlikely '' . the reasoning here is based on the central limit theorem : if such a system is subjected even to a drastic external perturbation , e.g. explosion , it is still likely that different parts of such a system , while being strongly perturbed , will continue to interact weakly , end hence the resulting total energy distribution will have gaussian form , which would be sufficiently narrow to satisfy condition ( [ t]).(see also refs.@xcite . )",
    "yet a single perturbation makes the energy window of participating eigenstates somewhat broader .",
    "the next level of this argument would be to ask , how many sequential perturbations are necessary to force an isolated macroscopic system to violate condition ( [ t ] ) .",

    "the second line of investigation is related to dealing with quantum systems that do not yet have large number of degrees of freedom , but already have a very large number of quantum levels , e.g. @xmath216 clusters of interacting spins 1/2 or a few cold atoms in an optical trap .    in this case",

    "therefore , it is clear that such systems can be driven out of condition described by conventional micro - canonical or canonical ensembles .",
    "will the qmc ensemble generically emerge in this case , possibly , after several perturbations@xcite ?",
    "if such an ensemble emerges , what are the observable signatures of it , e.g. in terms of measurable single particle properties ? what would be the effects of decoherence and subsequent quantum collapse in this case ?",
    "it is , in particular , possible that even if the broad qmc energy window collapses towards the canonical or micro - canonical shape , then the qmc - based calculations would predict the fluctuations of the resulting temperature .",

    "the values of these coordinates are @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "we choose the origin of the @xmath243-coordinate system on one of the above vertices .",
    "the @xmath42 coordinates of each vertex are then transformed into @xmath243 coordinates .",
    "then , in the @xmath253-coordinate system , we choose an @xmath44-dimensional hyperrectangle ( orthotope ) with edges parallel to the @xmath243 axes and with the extension along each axis limited by @xmath254 and @xmath255 such that @xmath243-coordinate of each polyhedron vertex falls between @xmath254 and @xmath255 , i.e. the polyhedron of interest is completely inside the above hyperrectangle .",
    "the monte - carlo sampling is then straightforwardly implemented in the hyperrectangle by choosing each coordinate @xmath243 randomly in the interval @xmath256 $ ] .",
    "the monte - carlo point is accepted , when , after transformation to the original @xmath42-coordinate system , all of its coordinates satisfy the positivity condition @xmath244 .",
    "the acceptance rate of this algorithm decreases exponentially with increasing @xmath29 , because high - dimensional polyhedron typically occupies exponentially small part of the volume of a hyperrectangle that covers it .",
    "the above ratio of volumes has a further strong dependence on the relative orientation of the hyperrectangle and the qmc polyhedron .",
    "it was our guess confirmed empirically that this ratio is strongly increased , once one of the faces of the polyhedron is parallel to one of the faces of the hyperrectangle .",
    "the faces of the polyhedron are determined in the @xmath42-space by the intersection of three hyperplanes : @xmath257 , energy hyperplane ( [ epsav ] ) and normalization hyperplane ( [ norm ] ) .",
    "if one of vectors @xmath242 is orthogonal to one of the polyhedron faces , then that face will be parallel to the corresponding face of the hyperrectangle .",
    "for example , if we want @xmath238 to be orthogonal to the face determined by hyperplane @xmath258 , then we choose @xmath238 to be parallel to @xmath259 , where @xmath260 in the original @xmath42-space .",
    "for @xmath145 , the resulting increase in algorithm s acceptance rate was , approximately , by a factor of 50 .",
    "we have not yet systematically optimized the choice of the `` parallel '' polyhedron face as a function of the corresponding energy @xmath32 from the viewpoint of increasing the polyhedron - to - hyperrectangle volume ratio , but , so far , our experience indicates that , for @xmath108 , the face corresponding to the lowest energy , i.e. originating from hyperplane @xmath261 , is one of the best .",
    "the algorithm can , perhaps , be further improved by optimizing the subsequent choice of @xmath241 , @xmath262 , etc . from the viewpoint of increasing the above volume ratio .",
