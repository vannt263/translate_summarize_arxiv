    "urban air quality is an issue of major concern owing to recent upward trends in population growth and urbanisation and industrialisation around the world .",
    "consequently , there is an increasing need to understand the detailed dynamics governing emission and transport of particulate matter in the atmosphere .",
    "turner  @xcite mentions a multitude of possible sources of air - borne particles , including those of anthropogenic origin such as industrial complexes and automobiles , as well as natural sources such as dust storms and volcanic eruptions .",
    "recently , there has been a surge of interest in related problems for disaster planning and national security that involve transport of radionucleotides and biological or chemical agents @xcite .",
    "the physics of particulate transport in the atmosphere are complex , in many cases involving multiple spatial scales ( ranging from the particle scale to near - source and long - range effects ) , multi - physics ( coupling mass transport , turbulence , chemistry and wet / dry deposition ) , and complex geometry ( e.g. , involving flow over topography or man - made structures ) .",
    "models for these and other aspects of atmospheric dispersion have a long history dating back to the pioneering studies of turbulent diffusion by richardson  @xcite and taylor  @xcite.the bulk of previous work has tackled the _ forward problem _ , by which we refer to the process of determining downwind contaminant concentrations given source emission rates and meteorological conditions .",
    "these forward models are usually based on a solution of the advection ",
    "diffusion equation that is obtained through either analytical or numerical means ( or a combination of both ) .",
    "the most prevalent approach used in practice , and which is implemented in many industry - standard software packages , employs an approximate analytical solution for point source emissions known as the `` gaussian plume solution . ''",
    "the one - dimensional plume solution for a single point source was originally derived by sutton @xcite and has since been extended to higher dimensions , as well as being applied to a variety of other more general situations involving ground - level deposition @xcite , multiple sources @xcite , height - dependent wind speed and diffusion coefficients @xcite , and line and area sources , to name just a few .",
    "we remark that while a majority of the applications considered to date have involved transport in the atmosphere , the gaussian plume models just mentioned may also be used to solve other advection  diffusion problems in such diverse areas as population growth @xcite orwater flow in rivers @xcite and the subsurface @xcite .",
    "another related stream of research has focused on solving the corresponding _ inverse problem _ , whereby measurements of particulate concentrations or ground - level depositions are given and the aim is to determine information about the location or efflux rate of contaminant sources .",
    "inverse methods based on gaussian plume type solutions have been developed by a number of authors in this context including jeong  @xcite and hogan  @xcite , while mackay  @xcite developed an alternate solution approach using complex variable theory .",
    "other researchers have applied a more direct computational approach by solving the nonlinear governing equations using methods based on kalman filtering @xcite , lagrangian particles @xcite , bayesian techniques @xcite , or by integrating the equations backward in time @xcite .",
    "several related methods have been developed specifically for handling the added nonlinearities arising from atmospheric chemistry , typically using newton type iterative methods @xcite , and sometimes combined with statistical techniques @xcite .",
    "these direct numerical approaches can be very computationally intensive , especially for 3d problems , and so will typically require use of parallel computing resources .",
    "regardless of the numerical method used , the inverse problem is often characterized as ill - conditioned in the sense that small changes in parameters can lead to very large changes in emission estimates ; these issues are discussed in much more detail by enting  @xcite , beychok  @xcite , and el badia  @xcite .",
    "the subject of this paper is a lead - zinc smelting operation located in trail , british columbia , canada .",
    "we are concerned with the transport of several contaminant species from multiple point sources on the site , and our aim is to develop an inverse algorithm that will determine emissions based on the gaussian plume solution of ermak  @xcite . the algorithm should be capable of generating reliable estimates of emissions rates given a relatively small number of deposition measurements .",
    "the novelty of this work stems from a combination of factors :    * we make use of real ( noisy ) meteorological and deposition data , in contrast with some other studies that use synthetic data @xcite .",
    "* deposition measurements are relatively small in number and represent time - averaged accumulations .",
    "this should be compared with some other methods that obtain very high accuracy by using very large numbers of sample points @xcite .",
    "another example is the work of hogan  @xcite , who proposed an iterative method based on the gaussian plume solution ( with constant wind and no deposition ) and which exploits the fact that concentration measurements at four locations uniquely determine the location and strength of a single point source .",
    "this approach can be very effective when the input data are known very accurately , but it degrades when the data are noisy .",
    "* the emission sources are at known locations , in comparison with some other studies that aim to determine both emission rates and locations @xcite .",
    "* we incorporate additional linear constraints on emission rates that are derived from chemical processes within the smelting operation .",
    "* deposition measurements are taken near ground level and at short distances from the source , which allows us to avoid errors inherent in long - range dispersion estimation and thereby minimize the ill - conditioning of the inverse problem .",
    "taken together , these factors allow us to develop a robust algorithm that is capable of estimating emission sources with a reasonable degree of accuracy .",
    "other studies have been performed on emissions at the trail site by goodarzi ( see @xcite and references therein ) , but they use a much simpler gaussian plume solution with no deposition and constant wind velocity , as well as validating their results using long - range deposition measurements and different experimental techniques .    we begin in section [ sec : problem ] by describing the problem under study and developing a detailed list of assumptions underlying the model . in section  [ sec : plume - model ]",
    "we provide details of the ermak solution to the advection  diffusion equation , and also incorporate multiple sources and a time - varying wind velocity .",
    "section  [ sec : inverse ] focuses on the inverse problem , deriving the linear equality and inequality constraints and describing the linear least squares solution algorithm .",
    "a series of numerical simulations are performed in section  [ sec : sims ] , including a study of the sensitivity of the model to changes in parameters and noise in the data .",
    "finally , we conclude with recommendations about the suitability of applying our model to actual environment reporting scenarios , and make suggestions on possible future work on extending our approach in order to improve accuracy and permit application to a wider range of atmospheric dispersion scenarios .",
    "the motivation for this work was a study of emissions from a number of contaminant sources at a large lead - zinc smelter located in trail , british columbia , canada and operated by teck cominco limited .",
    "our primary aim was to improve the accuracy of airborne emission estimates ( especially for zinc ) that the company is required to report annually to environment canada s _ national pollutant release inventory ( npri ) _",
    "stack emissions on the smelter site are directly measured for zinc and other contaminants , but this paper deals with low - level sources for which direct measurements are difficult to obtain .",
    "there are four sources on the trail site that emit zinc ( in the form of zinc sulphate , ) and these are indicated on the aerial photo in fig .",
    "[ fig : trailsite ] by the symbol s@xmath0 , where @xmath1 . to assist in estimating the level of zinc emissions ,",
    "the company performed a series of ground - level measurements of zinc as well as a number of other contaminant species ( strontium , sulphur , etc . ) .",
    "the measurements were taken over the two - year span 20012002 and consist of one - month accumulations of particulates within dustfall jars or `` receptors , '' which are located at nine separate locations r@xmath2 , @xmath3 ( also indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : trailsite ] ) .",
    "meteorological data is available for the same monthly periods in terms of wind speed and direction averaged over 10-minute intervals .",
    "the smelter is located in the columbia river valley which tends to funnel the winds on the site in a specific direction ; since the river is located just below the aerial photo in fig .",
    "[ fig : trailsite ] and runs roughly horizontally , the prevailing wind directions are roughly to the northwest or southeast .",
    "based on the above description , we now make a number of assumptions which are critical in the development of our dispersion model :    1 .   each emission source is considered to be a point source , and all emission rates are constant in time , at least for any one - month period over which",
    "depositions are measured .",
    "the[assume : wind ] wind velocity @xmath4 depends on time only and is uniform throughout the domain at any given instant .",
    "this is justifiable considering the relatively small dimensions of the site ( 1600 @xmath5 800 ) and the short time intervals of interest .",
    "3 .   variations in topography are negligible so that the wind can be assumed horizontal . although trail is located in a river valley bordered by steep mountains , the domain of interest is far enough removed from the neighbouring mountain range that any topography or boundary effects can be ignored .",
    "4 .   a ten - minute averaging period ( or time step )",
    "is used in all calculations , which is consistent with the assumptions employed in deriving the gaussian plume solution @xcite to limit errors in concentration .",
    "only dry deposition is considered since the dustfall measurements were all taken during months for which rainfall is relatively small .",
    "the effects of plume rise are incorporated by using an `` effective height '' for each stack .",
    "the atmospheric stability class is assumed to be class d ( `` neutral '' , according to the pasquill - gifford classification scheme ) for all monthly periods .",
    "there are insufficient meteorological data available to consider varying the stability class with time , and so our choice of neutral class is a compromise that takes into account predominant atmospheric conditions during the months of interest .",
    "it is important to note that even though we focus our attention on an application to a specific industrial site , the mathematical model and associated numerical algorithms we develop are general and so can potentially be applied to a wide range of other atmospheric dispersion problems .",
    "the release and transport of a single contaminant in the atmosphere can be described by the advection ",
    "diffusion equation @xmath6 where    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]",
    "we have derived a linear least squares approach for estimating contaminant emissions from several point sources given time - varying wind data and monthly - averaged deposition measurements .",
    "the model is based on ermak s gaussian plume type solution to the advection - diffusion equations  @xcite which incorporates particle settling and surface deposition .",
    "the novelty of our approach stems from its focus on short range emissions ( within 1000   of the source ) , incorporating additional equality and inequality constraints on contaminant sources , and its ability to handle time - varying wind data .",
    "the algorithm is used to estimate emissions of several contaminants from a smelting operation in trail , british columbia using dustfall measurements taken over several one - month periods during 20012002 .",
    "we demonstrate that the algorithm is efficient and robust to changes in several key parameter values in comparison to other approaches published in the literature . while there is significant variation from month - to - month and between the individual sources ,",
    "the average annual estimate of the emission rate is within 1020%  of the values reported to environment canada for the years in question .",
    "there remain a number of aspects of the model which require further study and refinement , for example by using more careful estimates of the contribution of plume rise to source heights , incorporating the effects of wet deposition during rainy periods , and allowing further variation in atmospheric conditions through the pasquill - gifford stability classification .",
    "we would also like to apply our insight into contaminant plume dynamics to guide the design of future studies of the trail site ; in particular , by relocating a receptor such as r3 to a more advantageous position ( e.g. , within the areas of peak concentration southeast or northwest of sources s1 and s2 ) .",
    "finally , we will perform a direct finite volume discretization of the 3d advection - diffusion equation , for which reliable estimates for the turbulent eddy diffusivities are essential .",
    "comparisons of these simulations with the results of our inverse gaussian plume algorithm will appear in a companion publication  @xcite .",
    "we are indebted to ed kniel of teck cominco limited for providing us with experimental data and also for many insightful discussions .",
    "funding for this research was provided by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ( nserc ) , the mitacs network of centres of excellence , and teck cominco .",
