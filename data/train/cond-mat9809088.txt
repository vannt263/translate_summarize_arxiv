    "the @xmath0 bond alternating heisenberg chains with the next - nearest - neighbor interaction attract much attention .",
    "schematic of this model is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic](a ) .",
    "the alternating nearest - neighbor interactions are controlled by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the parameter @xmath5 is the strength of the next - nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "magnetic properties of the spin - peierls compound @xmath6 is probably described by this model.@xcite alternatively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic](b ) , another aspect of this model is that this model describes a spin ladder system with a diagonal interaction ; @xmath5 and @xmath3 are strength of the interaction along the ladder and along the rung , respectively , and the diagonal interaction is represented by @xmath4 .",
    "it is thought that such a model describes the new spin ladder compound @xmath1 ( abbreviated cuhpcl).@xcite from the theoretical point of view , the plateau on the magnetization curve is observed in this model.@xcite    this model is also related to the haldane - gap system . for @xmath7 and @xmath8 or @xmath9 and @xmath10 , two spins connected with the strong ferromagnetic interaction ( @xmath3 ) form a triplet .",
    "because it effectively works as a @xmath11 spin , we can regard such a model as describing the @xmath11 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain in the strong coupling limit.@xcite    usually , such a system has a gap @xmath12 between the singlet ground state and a triplet excited one .",
    "an external magnetic field lowers the energy of a triplet excited state , but does not change the singlet ground state energy . at a critical field @xmath13 , the gap disappears and a transition from a non - magnetic state to a magnetic one occurs . in a stronger magnetic field @xmath14 ,",
    "the system is gapless until the magnetization is saturated , unless the plateau appears on the magnetization curve .",
    "one of the important features of the organic compound is its small coupling constant .",
    "the inorganic spin ladder compound @xmath15 , which is known for its excellent two - leg ladder character , has a gap @xmath16.@xcite thus , the critical field @xmath17 is not accessible . on the other hand , the organic compound cuhpcl which",
    "is thought to be the @xmath0 heisenberg two - leg ladder compound , has a smaller gap @xmath18.@xcite because the critical field @xmath19 can be accessed , some experiments@xcite have been done in the magnetic state which has finite magnetization .    on the basis of bosonization , chitra and",
    "giamarchi @xcite have studied such a gapped system , at the critical field @xmath17 and in its vicinity .",
    "they have concluded that for the @xmath0 heisenberg two - leg ladder system , the critical exponent does not depend on a magnetic field in the region close to @xmath17 .",
    "nevertheless , this is inconsistent with experimental data observed in cuhpcl.@xcite since cuhpcl has a strong interchain coupling , it is important to study a spin ladder system with a strong interchain coupling theoretically .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the critical properties of the spin ladder system with or without a diagonal interaction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic](b ) ) in the magnetic state . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , we present a model hamiltonian and the numerical method@xcite developed by sakai and takahashi . using this method",
    ", we calculate the critical exponent of the spin correlation function in the magnetic state for the @xmath0 heisenberg two - leg ladder with the strong antiferromagnetic interchain interaction in sec .  [",
    "sec : af ] , and with the strong ferromagnetic one in sec .",
    "[ sec : f ] .",
    "finally , we calculate the critical exponents taking a diagonal interaction into account , and compare the numerical results with experimental data@xcite observed in cuhpcl in sec .",
    "[ sec : diag ] .",
    "the last section is devoted to our conclusion .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian , @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the @xmath0 operator in the @xmath22-th site , @xmath23 is the total number of sites , and @xmath24 is the strength of a magnetic field applied along @xmath25-axis .",
    "the distance between unit cells which consist of neighboring two sites is set equal to unity .",
    "afterward we set @xmath26 and @xmath27 . the periodic boundary condition is applied . since the system has a rotational symmetry about @xmath25-axis and a translational symmetry",
    ", we can classify the hamiltonian into the subspace according to the magnetization @xmath28 and the wave vector @xmath29 .",
    "the lowest energy in each subspace is calculated using the lanczos algorithm . for the @xmath23-site system , we define @xmath30 as the lowest energy of @xmath31 in the subspace specified by the magnetization @xmath32 and the wave vector @xmath29 . for given @xmath23 and @xmath32 , @xmath30 takes the minimum at @xmath33 . from now on ,",
    "we simply describe @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "note that @xmath36 for even @xmath32 and @xmath37 for odd @xmath32 , for the parameters used in this work .    to study critical properties of the system in a massless region",
    ", we apply the numerical method@xcite developed by sakai and takahashi , which is summarized below .",
    "first , we consider the ground state energy .",
    "according to the conformal field theory for the one - dimensional quantum system,@xcite the ground state energy of the massless system depends on the system size as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the ground state energy per site in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath40 is the magnetization per site , @xmath41 is the sound velocity , and @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the central charge .",
    "we approximate @xmath41 numerically to be , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the wave vector closest to @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 . using those values of @xmath48 and @xmath41 , we can obtain the central charge @xmath43 .",
    "next , we consider some excitations to obtain the asymptotic form of the spin correlation function in the magnetic state .",
    "we define @xmath49 as the difference of the wave vector between the ground state and the excited one .",
    "the spin excitation which increases the magnetization ( @xmath50 ) has @xmath51 . in this paper",
    ", @xmath52 always equals @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , in the magnetic state , a gapless excitation can exist at the soft mode @xmath54 .",
    "because the system is gapless in the magnetic state , the spin correlation function should decay algebraically in the ground state .",
    "we define a spin operator @xmath55 as a combination of the two @xmath0 operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the asymptotic forms of the correlation function of the new spin operator @xmath58 should be@xcite @xmath59 according to the conformal field theory,@xcite the critical exponents @xmath60 and",
    "@xmath61 are obtained as@xcite @xmath62 in the following sections , we calculate the critical exponents using eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : eta ] ) and ( [ eqn : etaz ] ) .",
    "we study the @xmath0 heisenberg two - leg ladder system with a strong antiferromagnetic interchain interaction .",
    "the parameters we use are @xmath63 and @xmath64 . at first , to examine whether eq .  ( [ eqn : size ] ) is satisfied , we calculate size dependence of the ground state energy . in fig .  [",
    "fig : size ] , we plot the ground state energy @xmath65 as a function of @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 . because these lines seem linear ,",
    "we conclude that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : size ] ) is satisfied . for each @xmath69 , the @xmath70-intercept of this line",
    "is the ground state energy in the thermodynamic limit and the gradient of this line is @xmath71 . from the values of @xmath48 and @xmath41 , we can estimate the central charge ; @xmath72 .",
    "the estimated value of the central charge is equal to unity within a few percent .",
    "therefore , the system belongs to the universality class of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid .",
    "we also calculate the critical exponents @xmath60 and @xmath61 by eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : eta ] ) and ( [ eqn : etaz ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_finite ] , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are shown as a function of the magnetization . because @xmath73 and @xmath74 obviously depend on the system size , we plot @xmath73 and @xmath74 versus @xmath75 for @xmath76 in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaiso ] .",
    "it seems that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are proportional to @xmath75 except @xmath61 for @xmath77 .",
    "we evaluate the values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the thermodynamic limit as the @xmath70-intercept of the lines obtained by the least - squares method , except @xmath61 for @xmath77 .",
    "the deviation from the line is so small ( less than @xmath78 ) that we neglect it .",
    "for @xmath61 for @xmath77 , we extrapolate using the only two values for the largest system and for the next - largest one . for other @xmath69 , although @xmath73 and @xmath74 can be calculated only for two or three values of @xmath23 , we presume that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are proportional to @xmath75 . in fig .  [",
    "fig : eta_af ] , @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the thermodynamic limit are shown .",
    "if the system is described by the tomonaga - luttinger liquid , the universal relation @xmath79 must be satisfied.@xcite the values of @xmath80 in the thermodynamic limit are shown in table [ tab : central_af ] . from these values , we conclude that the relation @xmath79 is satisfied well .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath81 obtained above .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath80 for @xmath77 is slightly smaller than that for other @xmath69",
    ". this may be due to the peculiar size dependence of @xmath74 for @xmath77 . at @xmath77 ,",
    "the plateau exists on the magnetization curve when the coupling constants are selected adequately.@xcite this means the system has a gap and eq .",
    "( [ eqn : size ] ) is not satisfied .",
    "nevertheless , for the parameter we use here , there must not be the plateau on the magnetization curve at @xmath77 . to declare the relation between the size dependence of @xmath61 for @xmath77 and the plateau on the magnetization curve ,",
    "further studies are needed .",
    "next , we consider critical exponents for the spin ladder with a strong ferromagnetic interchain interaction , using @xmath82 and @xmath64 .",
    "this system is expected to behave like the haldane - gap system,@xcite because the strong interchain coupling makes two spins triplet along a rung and it works as one @xmath11 spin effectively .",
    "since we can not obtain the value of @xmath83 accurately , we calculate only @xmath60 in the magnetic state .",
    "the magnetization dependence of @xmath60 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_f ] . because the size dependence of @xmath60 is small ,",

    "this result is in good agreement with the value of @xmath60 for @xmath11 antiferromagnetic chain@xcite not only qualitatively but quantitatively .    as mentioned above",
    ", we can not calculate @xmath61 directly .",
    "however , if the system is described by the tomonaga - luttinger liquid and the central charge @xmath43 is equal to unity , @xmath84 must be satisfied also in this system .",
    "thus , we can estimate @xmath85 . to ascertain @xmath81",
    ", we calculate size dependence of the central charge and extrapolate the result to the thermodynamic limit . for the @xmath23-site system , we define @xmath86 and @xmath87 as follows .",
    "let @xmath88 be the greatest integer less than @xmath23 so that @xmath89 . @xmath65 and @xmath90 are calculated numerically .",
    "fitting these two values with eq .",
    "( [ eqn : size ] ) , we obtain @xmath86 as the gradient of this line .",
    "we also define @xmath87 as @xmath41 for finite @xmath23 , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : velocity ] ) .",
    "consequently , the central charge of the @xmath23-site system is defined as @xmath91 . for @xmath77 and @xmath68 , the size dependence of @xmath92",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : central ] .",
    "since @xmath92 seems to be proportional to @xmath75 , we fit these data with a straight line using the least - squares method and define @xmath43 as the @xmath70-intercept of this line .",
    "the results are @xmath93 for @xmath77 and @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "these values suggest that @xmath81 .",
    "for the @xmath11 antiferromagnetic chain with finite magnetization ( @xmath96 ) , the central charge is unity and the relation @xmath84 is satisfied.@xcite since the value of @xmath60 obtained here is in good agreement with that for the @xmath11 antiferromagnetic chain , the magnetization dependence of @xmath61 in this system must have similar behavior to that for the @xmath11 antiferromagnetic chain .    comparing these two results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_af ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_f ] ) , magnetization dependence of critical exponents shows characteristic behavior depending on the sign of the interchain interaction @xmath3 .",
    "similar behavior was found by sakai @xcite for the @xmath0 bond - alternating chains , which is described by the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) restricting @xmath5 to zero and @xmath3 to unity .",
    "he has concluded that this system is described by the tomonaga - luttinger liquid and its critical exponents satisfy @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 , in the magnetic state .",
    "furthermore , @xmath101 in the limits of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , regardless of the sign of @xmath4 .",
    "as mentioned previously , cuhpcl is described well by the isolated coupled @xmath0 chain so far . recently , chaboussant et al.@xcite have presented nmr study of this material in magnetic fields .",
    "they have measured the proton nmr relaxation rate @xmath2 , varying magnetic fields . in a magnetic state , they have observed the divergence of @xmath2 at low temperature .",
    "if the system is gapless , @xmath2 diverges algebraically at low temperature , @xmath105 they have concluded that @xmath106 equals @xmath107 at @xmath108 and increases with magnetic fields till certain strength of magnetic fields . after that , an increase in the magnetic field weakens the divergence . anyway , @xmath106 increases with the magnetic field near @xmath17 ( for small @xmath69 ) .",
    "as they have pointed out , the exponent @xmath106 is related to the exponent @xmath60 as @xmath109 .",
    "hence , @xmath60 must decrease with an increase in the magnetic field for small @xmath69 .",
    "it is believed that this material is a model system in the strong coupling ( @xmath110).@xcite thus , the behavior of @xmath60 must be similar to that of the spin ladder system with a strong antiferromagnetic interchain interaction as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : af ] .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_af ] , the exponent @xmath60 increases with an increase in @xmath24 from @xmath17 .",
    "this means that our numerical results differ from the experimental findings .",
    "it is thought that cuhpcl has not only ordinary ladder interactions @xmath3 and @xmath5 but a diagonal interaction @xmath4.@xcite to decide coupling constants , hayward et al.@xcite have calculated magnetization curves and fitted them on the experimental data . they have suggested that the diagonal interaction is ferromagnetic and its value is @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "hence , we calculate @xmath60 and @xmath61 again , turning @xmath4 on .",
    "the parameters we use are @xmath113 and @xmath114 , corresponding to the above ratio .",
    "the values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : eta ] ) and ( [ eqn : etaz ] ) have size dependence .",
    "thus , we extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit by the same way in sec .  [ sec : af ] .",
    "note that all of the @xmath73 and @xmath74 , including @xmath61 for @xmath77 , are proportional to @xmath75 when @xmath69 is fixed .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_diag ] and the values of @xmath80 are shown in table [ tab : central_diag ] .",
    "also in this system , the relation @xmath84 is satisfied well .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_diag ] , the maximum ( minimum ) of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is smaller ( larger ) than the results in sec .  [",
    "sec : af ] .",
    "further , the value of magnetization at which @xmath60 takes the maximum shifts to a larger value region .",
    "nevertheless , the ferromagnetic diagonal interaction does not change the magnetization dependence of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , qualitatively .",
    "our calculation still differs from experimental results .    on actual materials ,",
    "more complicated mechanisms may exist , e.g. interladder coupling , lattice distortion and so on .",
    "recently , nagaosa and murakami@xcite have treated the @xmath0 heisenberg two - leg ladder system taking a lattice distortion into account .",
    "they have concluded that the lattice will be distorted to modulate the interchain coupling with the incommensurate wave vector which is proportional to the magnetization . to explain experimental results",
    ", such effects may be important .",
    "moreover , the coupling constants are still controversial.@xcite to determine the coupling constants , the value of magnetization at which @xmath60 takes the maximum may be useful , because the experimental determination of the absolute value of the critical exponent is formidable .",
    "we have calculated the critical exponents of the spin correlation functions of the @xmath0 heisenberg two - leg ladder system with a diagonal interaction in a magnetic field .",
    "first , we have considered pure spin ladders ( a diagonal interaction is set to zero ) .",
    "depending on the sign of the interchain coupling , the magnetization dependence of the critical exponents exhibits characteristic behavior . for a ladder with a strong ferromagnetic interchain interaction , the critical exponents depend on the magnetization like that for the @xmath11 antiferromagnetic chains not only qualitatively but quantitatively .",
    "next , we have taken a ferromagnetic diagonal interaction into account in connection with cuhpcl .",
    "this diagonal interaction makes the maximum of @xmath60 small and the minimum of @xmath61 large .",
    "also , the magnetization at which @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) takes the maximum ( minimum ) becomes large .",
