    "single - dish monitoring over a period of 81d revealed that the flux density variability of the blue- and redshifted 6.7ghz maser features in this source is synchronized but anticorrelated @xcite .",
    "this finding essentially excludes a hypothesis that the variability is caused by collisional excitation by a shock wave from a common powering source . instead , the negative correlation can be attributed to changes in the dust temperature of the maser regions due to their distances from a common heating source and its luminosity variations @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a significant change in the flux density ratio of the two strongest blueshifted features over two years .",
    "the strongest feature in the spectrum , near @xmath12.6kms@xmath5 , has dropped from 1410 to 815jy on a time - scale of 8.1yr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this paper , we report nearly 4yr monitoring observations of cepa at 6.7ghz with the aim to expand our understanding of the maser variability .",

    "the other two features near 32.0 and 33.4kms@xmath5 show high variability of about 19 and 37 per cent , respectively .",
    "based on the standard deviation of the flux density values of ` non - variable ' features of this source , we estimate that our flux density calibration is better than 10 per cent .",
    "to quantify the variability , we used the variability indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the first index is given ( e.g. @xcite ) by    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the highest and lowest measured flux densities , respectively , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the uncertainties in these measurements .",
    "this variability index is a measure of the amplitude of the variability of the source and allows for the effect of measurement uncertainties .",

    "the average velocity of these features are listed in table [ prop - features ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,>,>,>,<,^ \" , ]     the profiles of the flaring features are well separated in velocity and not blended .",
    "we fitted gaussian curves to the observed line profiles of features f and g , obtaining the peak flux density , @xmath21 , and the velocity of the peak , @xmath22 and the full width at half - maximum of the line - width , @xmath23 .",
    "[ flare - time ] shows the variations of these three parameters .",
    "feature f did not show significant variations in @xmath22 and @xmath23 . note that with decreasing peak flux density the accuracy of fitting drops such that the scatter in @xmath23 gradually increases and individual estimates of less than 0.2kms@xmath5 and higher than 0.45kms@xmath5 are less reliable .",
    "feature g exhibited a systematic shift in radial velocity of 0.12kms@xmath5 and an increase in line - width from 0.33 to 0.56kms@xmath5 , as the flux density decreased over a time span of 436d during which the parameters could be measured with sufficient accuracy .",
    "[ linewidth - flux ] shows the dependence of the line - width on the flux density .",
    "the least - squares fit to the data of feature g gives the relationship ln@xmath23/ln@xmath24 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a result of line narrowing during maser amplification .",
    "the narrowing is a shallower function of intensity than that which is predicted by the standard theory of unsaturated masers , i.e. ln@xmath23/ln@xmath25 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the weak dependence of the line - width on the flux density for feature g and the constant line - width for feature e is poorly consistent with this theory .",
    "one can suggest that either the flares are behaving differently from the persistent components and are at least partially saturated , _ and/or _ the flares are line - broadened by some other mechanism such as turbulence ( @xcite ) .",
    "our densely sampled observations of cepa over the past 3.7yr allow us to study its 6.7ghz maser emission behaviour and obtain two main results .",
    "\\(i ) synchronized and anticorrelated flux density variations , of moderate or large amplitude , were seen from the blueshifted features a and b and the redshifted maser feature d , on time - scales of 110 and 290d .",
    "periodic variability ( 8487d ) of features a and d was identified during the last 290d of the monitoring period .",
    "\\(ii ) two flares , with durations of @xmath0510 and @xmath0670d , appeared at two different velocities in the redshifted part of the spectrum .",
    "the time delay between the flares was @xmath060d .",
    "none of the persistent features a ",
    "e in the maser spectrum showed any signs of variability similar to the very rapid rise and a slow decay exhibited by features e and g.    the synchronized and anticorrelated variability of methanol maser features at the blue- and redshifted velocities in cepa was first discovered by @xcite during a monitoring period of 81d .",
    "our observations indicate that this phenomenon of varying intensity occurred for the two pairs of features for a total of @xmath0400d at the beginning and the end of our monitoring period .",
    "high angular resolution maps of 6.7ghz methanol masers ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) suggest that variability is synchronized between different parts of an arched structure .",
    "in particular , when the flux density of the blueshifted maser components to the east and north ( features b and a in fig . [ map ] ) increases , the flux density of the redshifted component to the south  west ( feature d in fig . [ map ] ) decreases , and vice versa .    the maps of dust continuum , radio continuum and lines ( @xcite ; @xcite , their fig .",
    "5 ) imply that in projection the redshifted emission is closer to the main heating source @xcite than the blueshifted emission .",
    "as the methanol maser is probably excited by infrared radiation from warm dust ( @xcite ) , the observed variability can be attributed to changes in dust temperature due to luminosity variations in the heating source @xcite .",
    "they argued that if the luminosity increases , the dust temperature near the source would be too high to sustain the maser emission , whilst still being cool enough ( 100200k ) to allow masing further from the source . in turn , decreasing luminosity in the heating source would allow masers closer to the source but be too cold further away .",
    "this interpretation is poorly consistent with the ring model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) where almost the all clouds are located at @xmath0650au from the central object .",
    "it appears that at least features a and d ( fig . [ map ] ) lie at similar distances from the 7 mm source which is probably the central exciting object .",
    "changes in dust temperature due to variability in this object are thus unlikely to cause the anticorrelated changes in the flux densities of these maser features",
    ".    @xcite describe results which suggest a molecular disc around hw2 with a velocity gradient of @xmath05kms@xmath5 .",
    "if this is in keplerian rotation , an observer in a given direction close to the plane of the disc will see the brightest masers along lines through the centre of rotation and through the tangential limbs of the disc ( @xcite , their fig .",
    "1 ) , giving rise to a characteristic triple - peaked profile @xcite .",
    "this can be explained first by considering isotropic masing in the reference frame of the disc ; segments separated by 180@xmath26 have similar radial velocities with respect to the centre and thus maser emission from one side of the disc can be amplified further by material on the opposite side .",
    "secondly , from the point of view of a distant observer located in a plane close to the disc plane , the smallest velocity gradients , and hence , the strongest maser amplification in the direction of the observer , are located towards the centre and the tangents of the disc . in this model ,",
    "the diametrically opposite sections of disc are in radiative contact with the other . @xcite",
    "have shown that if the pump rate drops on one side of the disc then the opposite side will be affected soon after a time equal to the light crossing time . as a result",
    "the blueshifted emission will be anticorrelated with the redshifted emission or vice versa . however , this interpretation is not fully satisfactory because although the vlbi data suggest a ring model , the dominant maser motion is radial , at 1.3kms@xmath5 , not keplerian rotation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed velocities of the maser components suggest infall towards the central object ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". it may be possible to derive a model for the synchronized variations of maser features in cepa , including the effects of changes in one part of the ring on emission in other parts , if the 3d velocity field can be determined from proper motion measurements .",
    "flare events in the 6.7ghz maser line are very scarce .",
    "@xcite monitored 54 maser sources for 4 yr and found a flaring feature only in one source , i.e. g351.42 + 0.64 .",
    "the variability pattern of the @xmath15.88kms@xmath5 feature in this source is similar to that of features f and g of cepa ; its duration was @xmath0340d , @xmath27 0.1 , it fell exponentially for two time intervals .",
    "this flare had a maximum flux density of about 230jy , much stronger than the flare maxima of 6.3 and 8.5jy in cepa .",
    "quasi - periodic flare phenomena of similar patterns but with much shorter decay time - scales of 530d and @xmath28 of 0.170.20 were reported in methanol masers g33.64@xmath10.21 and g37.55@xmath290.20 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "other methanol sources with periodic behaviour are known , such as g22.357 + 0.066 with @xmath30 @xcite and g9.62 + 0.20e with @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "note that , in periodic and quasi - periodic sources , flaring activity usually shows correlated variations across several different features in the spectrum , but the behaviour of flaring features in cepa and g351.42 + 0.64 was completely unrelated to the other features .",
    "this indicates that these changes are restricted to a local volume of the gas .",
    "the emission at velocities of @xmath10.53 to @xmath10.36kms@xmath5 , which may correspond to feature g , was detected on mjd 53987 in the vlbi observation but not in the single - dish study @xcite .",
    "it appears to coincide with the southern part of the radio continuum jet of hw2 and with the cluster of maser clumps with velocities of @xmath13 to @xmath12kms@xmath5 @xcite also seen in the maps taken with the evn on mjd 53315 ( @xcite , their fig . 1 ) and with merlin on mjd 54072 @xcite .",
    "no emission near @xmath10.5kms@xmath5 was detected at these two epochs .",
    "this suggests that feature g undergoes variations of much higher amplitude than those measured with the 32 m dish . adopting a quiescent value of 0.035jy ( the sensitivity limit of the evn observations ; @xcite )",
    "the flux density of the feature has risen by a factor of up to 240 .",
    "the diameter of the cluster is @xmath040au @xcite for the source distance of 700pc @xcite and the velocity dispersion of the maser clumps is up to 2.5kms@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite argued that the velocity field of the methanol masers in cepa indicates a modest infall of maser clumps .",
    "the ring structure is probably the interface between the accretion flow and disc .",
    "direct measurements of infall of methanol maser clouds towards a high - mass young star were reported by @xcite .",
    "the above discussion may suggest that flaring features f and g arise in a small region lying in front of the continuum emission of the radio jet from hw2 .",
    "the flux density and morphology of this radio continuum is time variable @xcite . in such circumstances , maser emission from these features",
    "can easily be affected by several factors such as changes in path length , pump rate and background emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite proposed a fast ( @xmath01d ) injection of energy , released for instance due to magnetic field reconnection , into a small region , as a plausible mechanism behind the maser flare in source g33.64@xmath10.21 .",
    "this energy heats the gas and dust , increasing the infrared flux density which is the main pumping agent of the 6.7ghz transition @xcite .",
    "typical magnetic reconnection events are , however , too short to explain the 2437d rise times of features f and g. the dust cooling time is only 1.2d even in the optically thick case @xcite , which is about two orders of magnitude shorter than the decay times of the flares we have observed .",
    "thus , this model can not be applied to our source .",
    "it is postulated that the velocity field of the 6.7ghz masers in cepa signifies infall motion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for a flow velocity of 1.3kms@xmath5 @xcite ,",
    "a maser cloud with a characteristic size of 3au and brightness temperature of @xmath32k @xcite could move only 0.40.5au in 510670d .",
    "this suggests negligible changes in the cloud environment .",
    "@xcite proposed that the declining part of methanol maser flares in periodic source g9.62 + 0.20e can be ascribed to a change in the background photon flux density from a recombining thermal plasma .",
    "they found characteristic decay times from 40 to 400d for electron densities from 10@xmath33 to 10@xmath34@xmath35 .",
    "this range of @xmath36 is fully consistent with the observed values for features f and g ( table [ flar - feat ] ) .",
    "the model of @xcite reproduces well the exponential decay of flux density we have observed .",
    "the location of the flaring maser features is not certain but , as mentioned above , it has been suggested that they lie in the front of radio lobes with an electron density of about 35@xmath37 @xmath35 and recombination times of 8001300d ( @xcite ) for a recombination coefficient of 2.95@xmath38@xmath39s@xmath5 .",
    "the radio lobes of hw2 have persisted for a long time but episodes of ejection separated by 1.85yr were observed ( @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that the observed characteristics of flaring features f and g can be explained by variability in the seed photon flux density .",
    "this scenario could be verified by simultaneous vlbi observations of the maser line and radio continuum , at epochs guided by single - dish monitoring .",
    "the spectra available in the literature ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , in the torun 32 m telescope archive and seven evenly sampled spectra from the data set reported in this paper ( figs [ dyn - spectr ] and [ feat - var ] ) have been compiled to obtain a long - term light curve .",
    "the discovery spectrum @xcite was corrected for the rest frequency of 6668.5192mhz @xcite .",
    "the other archival spectra have been used as they were published since differences in rest frequencies have a negligible impact on the velocity scale .",
    "the light curves of the main features are shown in fig .",
    "[ longtermvar ] .",
    "feature d declined by a factor of 5.2 over a period of 21.6 yr .",
    "its light curve is best fitted by an exponential function with a decay time - scale of 7.39@xmath31.39 yr .",
    "the feature was clearly non - gaussian during the discovery observation ( @xcite ) and a shoulder at @xmath12.3kms@xmath5 , corresponding to a second feature , appeared on mjd 51674 .",
    "feature b shows a significant linear decay of 8.7@xmath32.0jyyr@xmath5 .",
    "a tentative linear decay of 3.1@xmath31.5jyyr@xmath5 is observed for feature a. note that for this feature the ratio between the maximum and the mean flux density is 2.80 .",
    "the peak flux densities of features c and e are fairly steady over 21.6  yr .",
    "the emission near @xmath10.7kms@xmath5 , with a peak flux ranging from 3.2 to 6.8jy , was seen during the mjd range of 5153651844 .",
    "the data imply that the declining part of a flare event was detected . at those epochs ,",
    "the precision of radial velocity measurements was @xmath30.5kms@xmath5 , which makes impossible to infer whether its peak velocity coincides with that of the recently detected feature g.    we conclude that the two strongest features , b and d , dropped in flux density by factors of 1.7 and 5.2 respectively , on a time - scale of @xmath022 yr .",
    "the other features do not show significant changes on this long - term time - scale but they display significant variability on time - scales of less than 5 yr . the vlbi map @xcite suggests that the emission of feature d comes from the same cluster of clouds ( clumps _ c , d , e _ in their figs 1 and 2 ) where from the emission of stable feature e ( clump _ c _ , therein ) arises .",
    "the kinematic model of the maser structure in cepa with a radial velocity of 1.3kms@xmath5 , proposed by @xcite , implies that the displacement of maser clouds would be only @xmath06au after 21.6 yr .",
    "this can be ruled out as the cause of selective decline of the maser intensity from some clouds in the same cluster .",
    "@xcite analysed the 6.7ghz methanol maser spectra of 21 sources and estimated the percentage of spectral features that either appear or disappear over a 10yr period .",
    "he deduced that the average lifetime of an individual methanol maser feature is approximately 150yr .",
    "our comparison of the present and archival data imply that feature d showing an exponential decay and features b and c with linear decays will disappear after @xmath050yr since the discovery .",
    "the other persistent features in cepa have probably longer lifetime .",
    "we have studied the 6.7ghz methanol maser variability of cepa based on 388d of monitoring spaced over about 1340d . we have found synchronized and anticorrelated flux density variations in two blueshifted features a and b , and one redshifted feature d over two periods of a total duration of @xmath0400d .",
    "this behaviour well constrains causes of variability , excluding shocks from an exciting source and supporting the disc model , where the maser amplification is switched between radial and tangential modes .",
    "although the methanol masers are probably not in a keplerian disc @xcite , they are located in a ring showing either outfall or inflow , and changes in excitation conditions could lead to maser amplification switching between radial and tangential modes .",
    "two flares of emission at redshifted velocities ( features f and g ) lasted 510670d .",
    "another flare at a similar velocity was identified in the archival data .",
    "the light curves of the flares show a rapid rise followed by a slow exponential decline .",
    "the tentative location of the flaring clouds at the front of the radio jet from hw2 may suggest that the flares are the results of variability in the seed flux density .",
