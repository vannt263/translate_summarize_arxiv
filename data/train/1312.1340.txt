    "it has long been known that the properties of galaxies ( e.g. colour , luminosity , star - formation rate , gas content , metallicity , morphology , ... ) depend on their environment ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is also established that there is a clear bimodality in the colour of galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ) . while red , early type galaxies ( the spectra of which are dominated by old stars )",
    "tend to live in denser environments and inhabit more massive dark matter halos , late - type , star - forming and therefore blue galaxies live primarily in the lower density `` field '' regions .",
    "the reason for this environment / halo mass dependent colour segregation is however not yet clear .",
    "the quenching of star formation in galaxies requires that gas accretion is suppressed .",
    "this can happen after mergers and during feedback from an agn ; when a galaxy experiences stripping of its cold and/or hot gas components ; or , it might happen that the accretion of gas and its ability to cool onto the galaxy and subsequent form stars is suppressed for some other reason .",
    "whichever mechanism(s ) are acting , they result in the observed correlations between galaxy properties and environment .",
    "a related , practical problem is that the term `` environment '' is not well - defined .",
    "some authors construct group catalogues to investigate properties as a function of host halo mass , while others measure their dependence on local galaxy overdensity .",
    "overdensity can be measured on different scales or quantified within the distance to the @xmath0 nearest neighbour ( for a review and comparison of the different methods see e.g. @xcite and @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "these are all local measurements computed for each galaxy .",
    "in contrast , the spatial correlation function measures the expectation value of the number of galaxy pairs with a given separation ( scale ) relative to a random distribution for a complete sample of galaxies . to examine the dependence on any galaxy property ,",
    "the sample is first binned on that property .",
    "none of these methods can simultaneously distinguish between the influence on galaxy properties of environment on different scales , while probing the full distribution of environment which is computed for each individual galaxy .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter wzb10 ) have proposed a new , practical method to disentangle the effects of galaxy density on different scales on the fraction of red galaxies .",
    "annuli of variable inner and outer radii are centred on each galaxy in a volume limited sample , and the surface density of neighbouring galaxies within these annuli and within @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 is measured .",
    "they then explore the dependence of the red galaxy fraction on these multiscale densities .",
    "measuring the densities on different scales and combining them opens up another dimension and can give insight into the underlying covariances .",
    "in this paper we use the halo model as a tool to investigate the dependence of the fraction of red galaxies on the distributions of multiscale density as explored by wzb10 . in its most general form",
    ", the halo model assumes that halos can be populated with galaxies in a predictable fashion which only depends on simple halo parameters ( e.g. mass ) .",
    "this can explain the observed dependencies of clustering statistics on galaxy properties .",
    "models of the halo occupation distribution ( hod in the following ) start by dividing the galaxy population into two : those sitting in the centre of a halo , dubbed `` central galaxies '' , and those which have been accreted onto the halo , and are now orbiting within it , called `` satellite galaxies '' .",
    "differences between the properties of the two populations can be expected , since central galaxies have always lived at the bottom of their potential well , whereas satellites are subject to stripping processes .",
    "different processes are likely to be actively quenching star formation in these two galaxy types . for a review of hod models , see @xcite .",
    "the halo model requires the spatial distribution of dark matter halos ; the halo mass function and bias ; the hod ; and the spatial and velocity distribution of galaxies within halos .",
    "the hod describes the expected number of galaxies ( central and satellite ) per halo using a parameteric form as a function of host halo mass .    in this paper",
    ", we utilize a halo catalogue extracted from the @xmath3-body millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "this circumvents problems establishing halo catalogues on small ( non - linear ) scales which is a difficult analytic problem .",
    "an analytic description of the halo bias , mass function and clustering would facilitate a faster computation of the model , however , it is currently not possible to model the highly nonlinear scales we are interested in accurately enough even with renormalised perturbation theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "the millennium simulation also provides a catalogue of associated subhalos which we use to distribute the galaxies within halos .",
    "we then populate halos with ( red and blue ) galaxies according to the hod model of @xcite , and while keeping the fraction of red central galaxies per halo constant , describe the fraction of red satellite galaxies using a simple function with two free parameters we can fit , a transition mass and a slope .    using the halo model to investigate the dependence of the red galaxy fraction on multiscale density , we are able to distinguish a scenario where the red fraction of satellites makes a sharp transition as a function of halo mass from one which makes a more gradual transition .",
    "this provides important constraints for physical models of galaxy formation and evolution . by adopting a model",
    "in which the red galaxy fraction is merely a function of halo mass we are testing the simplest hypothesis .",
    "however , we will show that information on different scales can provide both information on the dependence on halo mass and constrain the detailed way in which environment tracks the residual red fraction after accounting for this halo mass dependence .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section [ method ] we explain in more detail how density on different scales is measured , and the two - dimensional parameter spaces we use to characterize the density field . in section [ data ]",
    "we describe the sample of sdss galaxies we use for the study . in section [ model ]",
    "we describe how we populate halos with galaxies .",
    "to do this we use the functional form of the hod by @xcite , for which we derive the appropriate parameters for the galaxies in our sample from their analysis of the clustering of sdss galaxies ; this is described in detail in appendix [ appendix].once the haloes have been populated with galaxies , in section [ redgalfracsection ] we parametrise the fraction of red galaxies in the model as a function of halo mass using a tanh function with two free parameters . this recipe is used to allocate colours to galaxies .",
    "we can then compute the red fraction as a function of multiscale density for models with different parameters .",
    "we go on to discuss the feasibility of alternative results , highlighting the regions of our parameter space which rule them out . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss our results in the context of the literature , and room for future improvements .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ conclusion ] . throughout the paper",
    "we assume the cosmological parameters : @xmath4 .",
    "it is a matter of debate whether halo mass or galaxy ( over- ) density on sub- or even super - halo scales drives galaxy evolution and the quenching of star formation .",
    "this is likely to be different for central and satellite galaxies .",
    "the scale - dependence of quenching can be hard to disentangle by comparing `` one - dimensional '' quantities like estimated halo mass or measured overdensity .",
    "using multi - scale densities , wzb10 find no evidence for any _ positive _ correlation of red fraction with density on scales @xmath5mpc , once density on smaller scales are taken into account , consistent with results from @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a technique based on counts - in - cylinders to constrain the contribution of satellites to the hod of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) in sdss @xcite .",
    "we take this approach a step further , using _ complementary scale pairs _ of counts - in - cylinders ( or rather , cylindrical annuli ) to investigate the dependence of the fraction of red ( central and satellite ) galaxies on halo mass .",
    "more detailed information on environment and its influence on galaxy properties is available using _ densities on different scales_.    we use the multiscale approach first outlined by wzb10 .",
    "they select complementary pairs of annular scales ( a circular inner aperture and an adjacent but non - overlapping outer annulus ) which are used to trace the density field on these scales and the covariance between them . within this parameter space , they explore how the fraction of red galaxies depends on multiscale density , using a volume - limited sample with @xmath6 selected from sdss - dr5",
    ". we note that galaxies living in different topological regions ( e.g. clusters , voids , filaments ... ) live in different parts of the multiscale density parameter space .",
    "this allows one to e.g. separate galaxies living in the outskirts of clusters from those living in thin but dense filaments . in the following",
    "we will describe in a bit more detail how the density - density histograms are measured .      in order to measure density on multiple scales , cylindrical annuli",
    "are centered on each galaxy in the sample , and the local projected number densities of neighbouring galaxies inside these are measured . for an annulus with inner radius @xmath7 and outer radius @xmath8 , the surface density @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ( where necessary completeness corrected ) number of neighbours brighter than our limit , within the restframe velocity range @xmath12 and with a projected distance @xmath13 from the primary galaxy , where @xmath14 .",
    "as in wzb10 we choose neighbours brighter than the volume limited sample depth of @xmath15 and within @xmath16 km  s@xmath2 ( which corresponds roughly to a redshift space cylinder of length @xmath17mpc at the redshift under consideration ) .",
    "we calculate projected surface densities for the following annuli : @xmath18 mpc . in order to understand how galaxy properties depend on the overdensities measured on different scales , we combine pairs of non - overlapping annuli , in which case the densities are only correlated due to correlations in the underlying dark matter density field , not because the same galaxies are counted multiple times . for each pair of annular scales , @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    ", we divide the galaxies into two - dimensional logarithmically - spaced bins of density @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in this paper",
    "we choose the following pairs : @xmath23=\\left[(0.,0.5 ) , ( 0.5,1.)\\right ] , \\left[(0.,1 . ) , ( 1.,2.)\\right ] , \\left[(0.,2 . ) , ( 2.,3.)\\right]$ ] , and @xmath24 $ ] . for each 2d density bin for each of these pairs",
    ", we can compute the ( completeness - weighted ) fraction of red real and model galaxies , which can then be used to test the ability of our model to reproduce the observed population .",
    "[ datamultiscales ] shows the 2d multiscale density histograms ( binned number of galaxies ) for the sdss galaxy sample described in section [ data ] .",
    "the binning in density is logarithmic with two exceptions : the first bin on both scales contains galaxies with no neighbour , while the last bin on both scales contains galaxies with densities higher than a given threshold density .",
    "these are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . in each of the four histograms there are columns and rows in which the number of galaxies is much lower than in the adjacent columns and rows .",
    "this happens because the number of neighbours ( uncorrected for incompleteness ) is always an integer , and these do not fall into all logarithmically spaced bins .",
    "however , since the observed numbers have been completeness corrected ( see section [ completenesscorrection ] ) , some ( fewer ) galaxies cross into these columns / rows",
    ".    one of the advantages of combining the measurement of the density field on different scales is that there is a clear relation between the location of a galaxy in the 2d density histograms and the kind of environment it lives in . not only",
    "is it possible to distinguish cluster from field ( or `` void '' ) environments , but also to discriminate between filaments and infall regions .",
    "[ spatialdistribution ] shows the spatial distribution of the simulated galaxies in a cut - out of the millennium simulation ( @xmath33mpc , @xmath34mpc , and @xmath35mpc ) in redshift space .",
    "every point is a galaxy , colour coded by its position in the 2d histogram of densities .",
    "we show the example of the histogram where we combine density measurements on scales @xmath23=\\left[(0.,1 . ) , ( 1.,2.)\\right]$]mpc .",
    "while isolated galaxies in sparsely populated regions ( mostly light cyan ) live in the lower left corner of the 2d histogram ( low density on both scales ) , galaxies in very dense , cluster environments ( red ) live in the upper right corner , filamentary structures show up in dark green ( upper part , left of center , where the density on the smaller scale is intermediate and the density on the larger scale high ) , and infall regions show up in a brownish colour ( upper part , between red and green ) .",
    "this demonstrates nicely how our understanding of `` environment '' and its influence on galaxies can be enhanced by investigating galaxy properties as a function of the density on different scales .",
    "for our investigation we use spectra from the seventh and photometry from the eight data release ( dr7 @xcite and dr8 ( @xcite ) ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( part of sdss - ii @xcite , and sdss - iii @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "the selection criteria for our sample match that used by wzb10 .",
    "a volume limited sample is created by first selecting galaxies with valid spectroscopic redshift determination , which are part of the so - called ` main galaxy sample ' ( all extended sources with petrosian dereddened magnitude @xmath36 and mean surface brightness within half - light radius @xmath37mag arcsec@xmath38 , see @xcite ) , and then further restricting the selection to the redshift range @xmath39 , and petrosian k - corrected luminosity @xmath40 .",
    "it is impossible to find all neighbours for galaxies close to the edges of the sdss photometric footprint .",
    "therefore we measure the fraction of the area contained within the footprint for @xmath41 and @xmath42 circles centred on each galaxy using the method and code developed by @xcite .",
    "our further analysis is only conducted for the 132291 ( 129897 ) galaxies in our volume - limited sample for which the photometric completeness is more than 99.35% on @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) scales , where the larger sample is then used for all scales @xmath45 .",
    "since sdss spectra are acquired using a multiple fibre spectrograph , the diameter of the fibres puts a lower limit on the angular separation between two spectra : if two target galaxies are closer to each other than @xmath46 , it is only possible to take a spectrum for one of them in a single pass .",
    "this leads to a  certainly scale and density dependent  spectroscopic incompleteness of the number of galaxies in our annuli .",
    "our correction for this incompleteness is two - fold .    when measuring the density in each annulus , the number of neighbours is weighted by the sprectroscopic completeness correction factor : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the total number of photometrically identified spectroscopic targets within the annulus , and @xmath49 is the number with measured redshift",
    "this upweights the numbers of neighbours in dense regions such that in equation [ sigma ] @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the number of uncorrected neighbours within our radial , velocity and luminosity constraints .",
    "secondly , our hod description requires the full distribution of a volume - limited sample of galaxies in multiscale density parameter space .",
    "this requires correcting the number of galaxies in each density bin of complementary scales for spectroscopic incompleteness .",
    "we weight them according to their own completeness on the smallest scale , @xmath52 .",
    "we take our halo catalogue from a numerical @xmath3-body simulation .",
    "this provides accurate halo clustering and growth on non - linear scales . in order to have sufficient resolution to be able to populate small enough halos over a large volume",
    ", we chose to use the millennium halo catalogue @xcite .",
    "since the millennium run was simulated with a larger value of @xmath53 than is commonly accepted today ( @xmath54 , see e.g. @xcite ) , we follow suggestion of @xcite and @xcite and use the output at @xmath55 , treated as if it represents the local universe .",
    "the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) model describes the expected number of galaxies per halo , as a function of halo mass .",
    "we follow the description of @xcite , and split the hod into separate descriptions for central and satellite galaxies , such that : @xmath56~\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the expectation value for the number of central galaxies hosted by a halo of mass @xmath58 ; @xmath59 is defined as the halo mass at which a halo has a 50% probability of containing a central galaxy ; and @xmath60 describes how steeply the function is rising towards unity at low mass . in practice ,",
    "non - integral values of @xmath57 are applied by randomly allocating our central galaxies to halos of mass @xmath58 with a probability @xmath57 .",
    "the hod for the satellite galaxies scales as a power law with index @xmath61 , cut - off mass scale @xmath62 , and normalisation @xmath63 : @xmath64\\left(\\frac{m - m_0}{m^\\prime_1}\\right)^\\alpha\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    again , for small mass halos the scatter is incorporated by means of a simple monte - carlo method . for the larger masses ,",
    "when @xmath65 , we include the scatter by randomly drawing a number from the poisson distribution function which is determined by the expectation value predicted by the hod , @xmath66 , hence we populate a given halo with @xmath67 satellites .",
    "the general shape of the hod is justified by results of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations as well as high - resolution collisionless simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) for volume limited samples .    in section [ redgalfracsection ] ,",
    "requirements for a minimum sample size per @xmath68mag luminosity bin mean we need to limit our sample to @xmath6 .",
    "a single hod describes the full population down to a luminosity limit ",
    "e.g. @xmath69 for our full sample .",
    "to describe the @xmath6 population we also need a hod description of the @xmath70 _ bright _ population .",
    "this can then be subtracted from the full sample , which contains all our ( completeness - corrected ) galaxies in the volume and luminosity - limited ( @xmath40 ) , photometrically complete sample .",
    "we define the difference between the full and bright samples ( representing galaxies in the luminosity range @xmath6 ) as the _",
    "select sample_. @xcite have infered hod parameters as a function of luminosity from the projected correlation function of sdss dr7 galaxies ; in appendix [ appendix ] we describe in detail how we determine the appropriate hod parameters for our samples from their measurements .",
    "for each fof ( friends - of - friends ) halo of a given top - hat mass @xmath71 in the millennium simulation we now have the number of central ( zero or one ) and satellite galaxies in the halo .",
    "the central galaxy lives by definition in the centre of the halo , so it is allocated the coordinates of the parent halo .",
    "a catalogue of subhalos for each halo has been generated using the subhalo finder subfind @xcite .",
    "where any exist , their coordinates are allocated to the satellites .",
    "if the hod predicts more satellite galaxies than there are subhalos , we distribute the remaining galaxies according to the nfw profile @xcite , with the appropriate concentration parameter @xmath72 @xcite and virial radius given by the halo mass .",
    "these galaxies can be thought of as satellites which have lost their own dark matter halos via tidal stripping and follow the dark matter density distribution of the parent fof halo .",
    "galaxies have peculiar velocities , they move inside the deep potential of massive galaxy clusters , and galaxies in smaller halos are accreted onto larger structures .",
    "the doppler shift due to their peculiar velocity component along the line of sight adds to the cosmological redshift ( @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the observed redshift , @xmath75 the cosmological redshift , @xmath76 the peculiar velocity of the object , and @xmath77 is the speed of light ) .",
    "it is impossible to disentangle the individual contributions to the measured redshift .",
    "therefore we need a model of peculiar velocities to render the measurement of the densities performed in the simulation more realistic .",
    "since we work at @xmath78 very low redshift , we ignore the @xmath79 term in the equation above .",
    "the above described case of coherent infall onto large clusters leads to a compression of spherical structures on large scales @xcite . in order to take this effect into account",
    ", we use the redshift space coordinates of the halos in the millennium simulation , which are calculated from the real space coordinates and the peculiar velocity component in one direction , which we define as the `` line of sight '' , so the comoving coordinate of a halo becomes @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "satellite galaxies orbit within the potential of their host dark matter halo .",
    "the contribution of these peculiar velocities also leads to a distortion of the shape of a galaxy cluster in redshift space : it appears to be elongated along the line of sight .",
    "this is why we measure the projected densities in cylinders ( which have a length that corresponds approximately to the width of the line of sight velocity distributions of massive clusters , @xmath82 km s@xmath2 ) . for the satellite galaxies for which we use the coordinates of subhalos",
    ", we also directly use their redshift space coordinates as they are given by the millennium data base . for the others , distributed inside the halos following an nfw profile",
    ", we shift the real space coordinates of each satellite galaxy by an amount which corresponds to the redshift space distortion due to the typical velocity of a galaxy in a halo with the given mass .",
    "we calculate these values using the relation between halo mass and velocity dispersion by @xcite , @xmath83^\\alpha~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the normalization at mass @xmath85 and @xmath61 is the logarithmic slope . @xcite",
    "have determined the parameters from a fit to a an ensemble @xmath86cdm simulations to be @xmath87 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath88 .",
    "we assume spherical symmetry of the velocity dispersion and divide by @xmath89 in order to receive the width of the velocity distribution function along the line of sight , convert this value to a physical distance , then randomly draw a value @xmath90 from the corresponding distribution function ( which we assume to be gaussian ) , and add it to the redshift space coordinate of the halo in which the galaxy under consideration lives . thus the final redshift space coordinate ( along the line of sight ) of a simulated satellite galaxy is @xmath91 .",
    "it is always a matter of debate which observable is a good proxy for the `` passiveness '' of a galaxy .",
    "estimated starformation rate or the strength of the 4000  break d4000 determined from the galaxies spectra would of course be an obvious choice , however , since the sdss - i / ii fibers have a diameter of only @xmath92 , for a large fraction of objects the aperture is smaller than the extent of the galaxy , so the spectrum will not reflect their overall seds .",
    "aperture corrections introduce an additional uncertainty .",
    "therefore we decided to use the broad - band observations to distinguish passive from starforming galaxies , as they are the most direct and most unbiased observables .",
    "also we consider in this paper only one population integrated over the observed luminosity range , because we focus on the density dependence .",
    "subsamples split by mass and luminosity can be investigated in future work .",
    "we determine the fraction of red sdss galaxies in each 2d density bin for each pair of scales using the exact same procedure described by wzb10 . for each subset of galaxies ,",
    "the bimodal @xmath93 model colour distribution is fit using a double gaussian function as first proposed by @xcite .",
    "the parametrisation of the colour distribution with a double gaussian ( and subsequent integration of the fit to derive the fraction of red galaxies ) also takes the intrinsic scatter between the two populations into account , and describes the overlap of the wings of the two gaussians . for more details of the exact fitting procedure",
    "we refer to wzb10 .",
    "there are five free parameters to the fits : the relative fraction of galaxies in each ( red and blue ) peak , and the mean colour and width of each peak .",
    "as found by wzb10 , the peak means and widths depend upon both density and luminosity .",
    "therefore we bin galaxies not only by density but also by luminosity in bins of @xmath94 width .",
    "we require at least 25 galaxies for a robust fit : the most luminous galaxies ( petrosian magnitudes @xmath95 ) can not be subsampled with sufficient resolution in density and luminosity .",
    "thus we only consider galaxies in the luminosity range @xmath96 as in wzb10 . from each fit",
    "we extract the fraction of galaxies in the red peak .",
    "we then compute the weighted mean red fraction of all luminosity bins within a given density bin , weighted by the total number of galaxies per luminosity bin . the final red fraction per 2d density bin",
    "is then subtracted from the total red fraction of galaxies ( which is @xmath97 ) to produce the residual dependence of red fraction on multiscale density , @xmath98 .",
    "the resultant plots of @xmath98 vs density for our four pairs of scale are shown in fig .",
    "[ densdensredfracdata ] .      having populated the halos using the hod parameters derived from the measurement of @xcite , we can assign a colour ( red or blue ) to the model galaxies , according to a description which reflects the different scenarios we want to probe . as different physical processes act on central and satellite galaxies , and the fraction of passive , red galaxies has a different dependence on halo mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we treat them differently .    fig .",
    "[ satfrac ] shows the fraction of galaxies in the select sample of model galaxies ( best fits ) which are satellites as a function of density for our four pairs of scales .",
    "although most galaxies are centrals , these are heavily focused to low density , especially on small scales .",
    "this means that much of our multiscale density parameter space is dominated by satellite galaxies .",
    "combine this fact with the greater halo mass range of satellites ( fig .",
    "[ hodplot ] ) , and it is clear that our data and method offers more dynamic range to explore the imprint of environment on satellite galaxy properties than on central galaxies . however , our parameter space is also useful to find central galaxies : galaxies with no neighbours , especially on larger scales , are clearly the isolated , central galaxies of lowish mass halos .      the total number of central galaxies in the select sample is greater than the total number of satellites .",
    "however , central galaxies in this sample are found in a relatively narrow range of halo mass  @xmath99 . as these halos contain @xmath100 satellite ( figure  [ hodplot ] ) the dynamic range in the number of neighbours",
    "is limited . therefore centrals are located at low density only , and most 2d bins of our multiscale density parameter space are dominated by satellite galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ satfrac ] ) .",
    "for example , it is difficult to distinguish @xmath101 halo central galaxies from @xmath102 halo central galaxies , and therefore to say anything about the correlation between halo mass and central galaxy properties .",
    "this being the case , we adopt the simplest strategy : a constant red fraction at all halo masses . the value of @xmath103 can be determined directly from fig .",
    "[ densdensredfracdata ] : the galaxies having the lowest density on the largest scales ( no neighbours even in large annuli ) are all central galaxies .",

    "we parameterize the dependence of the fraction of red satellite galaxies on halo mass using a hyperbolic tangent form which assymptotically approaches minimum and maximum values at low and high halo mass respectively , with a symmetry around the _ transition mass _ , @xmath105 :    @xmath106+f^{red}_{min}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the red fraction of satellites increases with halo mass from the minimum value @xmath107 up to the maximum value @xmath108 .",

    "[ redsatfracplot ] the parameters are chosen to conserve the same total fraction of red satellite galaxies  a large change in @xmath109 corresponds to a small change in @xmath105 ( see section  [ constraintstotalredfrac ] ) .    we assume the maximum red satellite fraction is equal to the red fraction of galaxies in the highest density bin on the smallest scales which is dominated by the satellites of massive halos : @xmath114 . to estimate the minimum red satellite fraction , we assume it can not be lower than the red central fraction . all galaxies are formed as centrals , and those which are now satellites have been since accreted onto a more massive halo .",
    "also , whatever the effect of becoming a satellite is , it can not turn galaxies which have already been red before accretion into blue ones .",
    "we need to define the fraction of galaxies which were quenched as satellites , accounting for the fact that some will have been quenched in processes which affect central galaxies .",
    "@xcite nicely demonstrate in their fig .",
    "7 that the fraction of galaxies which have their star formation quenched as satellites , and its dependence on stellar mass , is sensitive to the definition of _ quenched as satellites_. there are two possible definitions .",
    "the first is all satellite galaxies quenched since infall ( @xcite green line in their fig .",
    "7 )  to estimate this fraction one needs the fraction of galaxies which were quenched as central galaxies _ before infall _ , which is substantially different from the @xmath115 quenched central fraction .",
    "the second definition ( our choice ) is those satellite galaxies quenched since infall _ which would not have been quenched anyway as central galaxies _",
    "( @xcite dotted line in their fig .",
    "this is _ defined _ to be the difference between the quenched fraction of satellites and centrals at @xmath115 .",
    "indeed , if the processes affecting central galaxies are still active once a galaxy is a satellite , it represents that fraction of satellites which have been quenched by satellite - specific processes ( for an equivalent definition , see @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore choose to examine the red satellite fraction halo mass dependence as a _",
    "net _ difference with respect to the central red fraction .",

    "a best fit gives @xmath163 and log @xmath164 .",
    "the reasons for this apparent discrepancy are complex , yet important to understand .",
    "firstly we note that at realisitically high halo masses the two solutions converge to a value @xmath165 , consistent with the value seen at high density on large scales .",
    "it seems reasonable that this is truly a typical _ global _",
    "value for massive halos , while segregation can dominate local values on smaller scales .",
    "the two methods diverge from each other at low halo mass , where a much lower @xmath147 is found using the group catalogue than is inferred from our fits to the multiscale densities .",
    "the steep fit to the group catalogue is inconsistent with the 90@xmath166 confidence limits even on larger scales ( fig .",
    "[ chisquared_logmtgamma ] ) and produces too few red satellite galaxies in total ( see fig .",
    "[ constraintsfromfredtot ] ) .",
    "this is only possible because the red fraction of _ central _ galaxies is higher than our choice .",
    "indeed , in halos of log @xmath167 which host the central galaxies of our sample , the red fraction of group catalogue centrals is almost identical to that of group catalogue satellites , and significantly higher than that seen in the lowest bins of density ( the most isolated galaxies ) .",
    "this illustrates the main problem with allocating every galaxy to a halo in a group catalogue : it works on average , but , especially in low mass halos , there is no way to accurately assess whether each galaxy belongs to the same halo as the next one without full six - dimensional phase space information ( never observable ) .",
    "therefore some halos will be artificially divided while others will be artificially joined .",
    "satellites of low mass halos within our luminosity range will be : a ) of similar luminosity to the `` central '' galaxy , and b ) often not really part of the same halo .",
    "together these effects work to force the red fraction of central and satellite populations to be roughly equal , but larger than the more conservatively estimated `` isolated '' population of true centrals in our lowest density bin .",
    "finally , we note that our prescription does not allow the red fraction of satellites to be all of : very shallow ( as in our best fit ) ; reach the maximum value seen on large scales ; _ and _ reach @xmath107 within populated halos ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "this gives our functional form the freedom to become very shallow by reaching its minimum value at some low mass of halo which is never encountered .",
    "our fits appear to be primarily constrained by the following requirements : that a sensible maximum red fraction is reached ; that the transition with density is not sudden ; and that the total red fraction is roughly correct .",
    "this final requirement , together with the low red fraction of central galaxies ( as observed for isolated galaxies ) , requires a shallow slope .",
    "together with the first two constraints , this means that @xmath107 ( and likewise the low red satellite fractions derived from the group catalogue at low halo mass ) _ can not _ be obtained . indeed , there is no guarantee that the red satellite fraction _ should _ be as low as the red fraction of centrals : our condition @xmath169 is merely designed to apply a sensible lower limit .",
    "it is nonetheless clear that , regardless of the very different biases of the two methods , that an at least _ fairly _ shallow slope is preferred over a sharp transition .",
    "the gradual increase of red satellite fraction with halo mass is not consistent with a scenario in which galaxies only become red in halos above a given mass .",
    "rather , it favours a mechanism which acts hierarchically , such that galaxies in more massive halos simply have a larger probability of having experienced an event which suppresses star formation .",
    "the gradual dependence of red fraction on density also encourages the idea that this does not require a dense sub - clump within a halo of whatever mass , but can happen ( though with lower probability ) in a low density region of a lowish mass halo .",
    "central , isolated galaxies also become red , and so it seems not inconceivable that the satellite galaxies in low density regions and low mass halos experience , with enhanced probability , the same or similar mechanism as the central galaxies .",
    "this paper presents for the first time a simple hod - based fit to multiscale density parameter space .",
    "it is designed to test whether a simple prescription of red fraction which only depends upon halo mass and central vs satellite classification can describe the full dependence of red fraction on multiscale density  and it does indeed describe this full parameter space very well , considering its simplicity .",
    "clearly there is nonetheless much room for improvement or further adaptations of both model and method  a few examples are : + _ improvement of the modelling : _    * our allocation of galaxies  one per subhalo and the remainder to follow a nfw profile  could be improved using a subhalo hod ( @xmath170 galaxy per subhalo ) , in particular in the halo accretion regions . while this may be more realistic",
    ", it has the disadvantage that it introduces additional free parameters . * on scales smaller than halos , galaxies are segregated such that the red fraction increases with decreasing halo - centric radius , especially in clusters , e.g. ( @xcite ) .",
    "this could be matched by adding a dependence of the colour of a galaxy on e.g. subhalo mass or / and halo - centric distance to the hod recipe .",
    "* our current model assumes that the minimum red fraction of the satellites at small halo masses is equal to the total fraction of red centrals _ at redshift @xmath115 _ , @xmath171 .",
    "the assumption is based on the fact that all satellites have been centrals before they fell into a more massive halo and became satellites .",
    "however , at the time of accretion the fraction of red central galaxies may have been different from that seen in the local universe . nonetheless , we can regard @xmath107 as the fraction of red satellites which we would find if the satellites evolved in exactly the same way as the centrals .",
    "an improvement of the model would be to take the time since accretion into account , e.g. by tracking of individual galaxies via their host haloes in the simulation , while self - consistently track their colours . *",
    "using a more realistic numerical n - body simulation ( with lower value of @xmath172 ) as input , with larger volume and higher resolution will be a better description of the clustering and mass function of the dark matter halos .",

    "* at the moment we fit four two - dimensional pairs of scale .",
    "the measurements are correlated , because the same galaxies and their neighbours can appear in all four pairs of scale . a larger data",
    "set would make it possible to fit a higher ( than two- ) dimensional parameter space ( preferentially a single multi - dimensional space where all scales are independent ) .",
    "however , since the number of galaxies falling into a bin decreases rapidly with the dimension of the histogram ( and the noise increases ) , this only makes sense for very large numbers of galaxies , or otherwise broader binning is required .",
    "* constraints on galaxy evolutionary processes can be better constrained by examining how multiple , complimentary galaxy properties ( derived star formation rates or spectral indices tracing stellar populations of different ages , colours , morphology etc ) depend simultaneously on multiscale density and galaxy mass .",
    "this expansion of the parameter space can only be contemplated with sufficient statistics , and once the methodology is well understood in a simpler case such as the one presented here .",
    "these improvements are at the current stage either impossible ( e.g. neither is there a larger high - resolution simulation , nor a larger volume - limited spectroscopic sample of galaxies with a representative population mix and a large sampling rate available ) , or far beyond the scope of this paper , which has the main purpose of introducing the method , proving that it is able to give stable results and illustrating complimentary information from different scales .",
    "possible improvements as well as applications to higher redshifts ( e.g. using the vipers survey ) can be addressed in the future .",

    "this means that while high red satellite fractions only occur in galaxy clusters ( @xmath183 ) there is an enhanced red fraction over the field ( central or low halo mass ) value down to at least @xmath184 , consistent with group versus field comparisons .",

    ", the gradient in red fraction with density would be much steeper than observed , and can be ruled out .",
    "the fact that the @xmath117 distributions are different for the four combinations of scales , in particular that the one on the smallest scales deviates from the others , can well be explained by the lack of colour segregation within the haloes in our model .",
    "if in fact red galaxies are concentrated towards the centres of the haloes , the red fraction on very small scales ( smaller or comparable to the halo sizes ) created by the model would be larger .",
    "on larger scales this effect would not be measured , and indeed the larger scales yield better fits even without colour segregation . if we assume that the real maximum red satellite fraction on small scales is even larger than the value we can measure ( @xmath114 ) , e.g. because blue field galaxies can be scattered into the cylinders , we derive nevertheless a very similar course of the function within the range of observed halo masses .    this example demonstrates the power of the method : the analysis of the galaxy properties on different scales ( and combinations thereof ) give insight into different aspects of how galaxies populate dark matter haloes , and the influence of the environment on those scales on their properties . at the same time by investigating the limitations of the model it is possible to understand which observations can not be described by a simple hod model in which galaxy properties depend only on halo mass ( e.g. colour segregation , or satellite quenching in infall regions ) .",
    "a constant fraction of red satellites can not be ruled out , but can not explain the high red fractions in high density regions on the smallest scales .",
    "again this is a hint that there is a decrease of the red satellite fraction with galacto - centric distance .",
    "we also examined the difference between a constant red _ central _ fraction and a sharp transition in the red central fraction ( such that the total red central fraction is conserved ) . within our limited range of halo mass , this would be possible with a transition at @xmath155 .",
    "this would be consistent with a scenario suggested by some authors ( e.g. @xcite ) in which newly accreted gas onto the halo is shock - heated above a critical halo mass , and the cooling of that gas onto a central galaxy is inefficient .",
    "the extreme sharp transition solution can be ruled out because regions of low densities on small scales are populated by isolated galaxies which are the central galaxies of halos with mass below @xmath153 .",
    "observations tell us that there are indeed @xmath185 red galaxies in these regions , while with a sharp transition at @xmath153 there would be none .",
    "in order to populate the dark matter haloes of the millennium simulation with galaxies , we use the hod description by @xcite , see equations [ hodcen ] and [ hodsat ] . in their paper",
    ", they use the projected correlation function of volume - limited samples of galaxies constructed from the main sample of the sdss dr7 to derive hod parameters as a function of luminosity ( and color ) .",
    "since the upper redshift limits are different for different luminosity thresholds in their analysis , our samples do not comprise exactly the same galaxies , but as the authors show , cosmic variance is not a problem for their investigation of the hod parameters as a function of luminosity , even though each measurement has been carried out in a different volume ( nor can redshift evolution be , considering the maximum redshift limit of @xmath186 ) .",
    "hence we can use their measurement of the hod parameters to describe the multiscale densities in our sample .",
    "their halo masses are in units of @xmath187 and their absolute luminosities calculated assuming @xmath188 , while we use @xmath189 throughout the analysis",
    ". therefore we shift the magnitudes and parameters accordingly , then fit them , in order to derive the appropriate values for our full and bright samples . the values and fits",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ zehaviparams ] . while @xmath190 and @xmath191 can be well described by a third order polynomial , the best choice of a parametric form of @xmath60 , @xmath192 and @xmath61 is not so obvious . in the case of @xmath60",
    "it seems that the value is constant and high ( @xmath193 ) for bright galaxies ( @xmath194 ) and is constant and low ( @xmath195 ) for fainter galaxies .",
    "we adopt these values , which are indicated by blue lines in fig .",
    "[ zehaviparams ] , for our bright and full samples .",
    "@xmath192 looks as if a fit with a straight line would be appropriate .",
    "however , taking the error bars into account , the resulting fit ( red line in fig .  [ zehaviparams ] ) is not satisfying .",
    "the third order polynomial we use instead ( blue line ) has a slightly smaller @xmath117 .",
    "although the value of @xmath61 is not well determined for very bright galaxies , again a parametrisation with a third order polynomial seems not to be an unreasonable choice .    from these fits we find for the full sample ( @xmath40 ) : @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 ; and for the bright sample ( @xmath70 ) : @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 .",
    "however , we found that if we use exactly these parameters , we do not reproduce our observed densities in the full sample , as can e.g. be seen from fig .",
    "[ dens_zehavi ] : the plot shows the number of observed galaxies per density bin @xmath206 in comparison with the densities which are measured from the simulated galaxies when we use the above hod parameters to populate the millennium . ) , hence some ( fewer ) galaxies cross into these columns / rows ( see also section [ multiscales ] ) . ] in particular on high densities the observed numbers of galaxies falling into the bins are significantly higher by a factor which increases with density as compared to the ones predicted by the hod parameters derived from the fits .",
    "we achieve a much better description of the measured numbers of galaxies particularly at high densities if we use @xmath207 instead of @xmath199 , the effect of which is to create more satellite galaxies and hence more galaxies at higher densities",
    ".    the reason our measurement demands a slightly lower value of @xmath191 may be cosmic variance ( we are not investigating exactly the same volume as @xcite ) , the way we populate the haloes ( one per subhalo and the remainder to follow a nfw profile in a spherical halo ) , or the methodology ( while the correlation function is a convolution of the overdensity field with itself ( an expectation value ) , information about the distribution of local densities is lost , which could make it more difficult to distinguish the two cases presented in fig .  [ dens_zehavi ] ) . in any case , in order for the simulated galaxies to describe the observations better , we used this altered parameter for the analysis of the dependence of the red fraction on the multiscale densities throughout this paper .",
