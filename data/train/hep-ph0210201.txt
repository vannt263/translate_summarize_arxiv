    "the theoretical study of the nonrelativistic heavy quark - antiquark system @xcite and its application to bottomonium @xcite and toponium @xcite physics is of special interest because it relies entirely on the first principles of qcd .",
    "the system in principle allows for a perturbative treatment with the nonperturbative effects being well under control and with no crucial model dependence .",
    "this makes the heavy quarkonium to be an ideal place to determine the fundamental qcd parameters such as the heavy quark mass @xmath0 and the strong coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "an essential progress has been made in the theoretical investigation of the nonrelativistic heavy quark dynamics based on the effective theory approach @xcite .",
    "the analytical results for the main parameters of the nonrelativistic heavy quark - antiquark system are now available up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) ( see @xcite for a brief review ) .",
    "the nnlo corrections have turned out to be so sizeable that it appears to be indispensable also to gain control over the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath2lo ) both in regard of phenomenological applications and in order to understand the structure and the peculiarities of the nonrelativistic expansion .",
    "the calculation of the heavy - quarkonium spectrum to @xmath3 @xcite was the first breakthrough in the n@xmath2lo analysis .",
    "recently , the @xmath4 corrections to the heavy - quarkonium production and annihilation rates have been also obtained @xcite .",
    "the subject of this talk is restricted mainly to the analysis of the spectrum .    in the next section",
    "we briefly introduce the basic ingredients of the nonrelativistic effective - theory formalism . in sect .",
    "3 the structure of the third order corrections to the heavy quarkonium ground state energy is outlined and the final result is presented . in the last section",
    "this result is applied for the phenomenological analysis of the top - antitop pair production near the threshold .",
    "the nonrelativistic behavior of the heavy - quark - antiquark pair is governed by a complicated multiscale dynamics . in the nonrelativistic regime , where the heavy - quark velocity @xmath5 is of the order of the strong - coupling constant @xmath1 , the coulomb effects are crucial and have to be taken into account to all orders in @xmath1 .",
    "this makes the use of the effective theory mandatory .",
    "the effective - theory approach allows us to separate the scales and to implement the expansion in @xmath5 at the level of the lagrangian .",
    "let us recall that the dynamics of a nonrelativistic quark - antiquark pair is characterized by four different _ regions _ and the corresponding modes @xcite : ( i ) the hard region ( the energy and three - momentum scale like @xmath0 ) ; ( ii ) the soft region ( the energy and three - momentum scale like @xmath6 ) ; ( iii ) the potential region ( the energy scales like @xmath7 , while the three - momentum scales like @xmath6 ) ; and ( iv ) the ultrasoft region ( the energy and three - momentum scale like @xmath7 ) .",
    "nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite is obtained by integrating out the hard modes . subsequently integrating out the soft modes and the potential gluons results in the effective theory of potential nrqcd ( pnrqcd ) @xcite , which contains potential heavy quarks and ultrasoft gluons , ghosts , and light quarks as active particles .",
    "the effect of the modes that have been integrated out is two - fold : higher - dimensional operators appear in the effective hamiltonian , corresponding to an expansion in @xmath5 , and the wilson coefficients of the operators in the effective hamiltonian acquire corrections , which are series in @xmath1 .",
    "the theory of pnrqcd is relevant for the description of the heavy - quarkonium system .",
    "let us recall its basic ingredients . in pnrqcd ,",
    "the ( self)interactions between ultrasoft particles are described by the standard qcd lagrangian .",
    "the interactions of the ultrasoft gluons with the heavy - quark - antiquark pair are ordered in @xmath5 by the multipole expansion . for the n@xmath2lo analysis ,",
    "only the leading - order ( lo ) emission and absorption of ultrasoft gluons have to be considered .",
    "they are described by the chromoelectric dipole interaction .",
    "the propagation of the quark - antiquark pair in the colour - singlet and colour - octet states is described by the nonrelativistic green function of the effective schrdinger equation .",
    "the lo approximation for the green function is given by the coulomb solution , which sums up terms singular at threshold and describes the leading binding effects .",
    "the corrections due to higher - order terms in the effective hamiltonian can be found in rayleigh - schrdinger time - independent perturbation theory as in standard quantum mechanics .",
    "let us now turn to the problem of perturbative calculations in the effective theory . both nrqcd and pnrqcd have specific feynman rules , which can be used for a systematic perturbative expansion .",
    "however , this is complicated because the expansion of the lagrangian corresponds to a particular subspace of the total phase space .",
    "thus , in a perturbative calculation within the effective theory , one has to formally impose some restrictions on the allowed values of the virtual momenta .",
    "explicitly separating the phase space introduces additional scales to the problem , such as momentum cutoffs , and makes the approach considerably less transparent .",
    "a much more efficient and elegant method is based on the expansion by regions @xcite , which is a systematic method to expand feynman diagrams in any limit of momenta and masses .",
    "it consists of the following steps : ( i ) consider various regions of a loop four - momentum @xmath8 and expand , in every region , the integrand in taylor series with respect to the parameters that are considered to be small there ; ( ii ) integrate the expanded integrand over the whole integration domain of the loop momenta ; and ( iii ) put to zero any scaleless integral in step  ( ii ) , dimensional regularization , with @xmath9 space - time dimensions , is used to handle the divergences . in the case of the threshold expansion in @xmath5 , one has to deal with the four regions and their scaling rules listed above . in principle",
    ", the threshold expansion has to be applied to the feynman diagrams of full qcd . however , after integrating out the hard modes , which corresponds to calculating the hard - region contributions in the threshold expansion , it is possible to apply step ( i ) to the diagrams constructed from the nrqcd and pnrqcd feynman rules .",
    "equivalently , the lagrangian of the effective theory can be employed for a perturbative calculation without explicit restrictions on the virtual momenta if dimensional regularization is used and the formal expressions derived from the feynman rules of the effective theory are understood in the sense of the threshold expansion . in this way , one arrives at a formulation of effective theory with two crucial virtues : the absence of additional regulator scales and the automatic matching of the contributions from different scales @xcite ( see also@xcite ) .",
    "the second property implies that the contributions of different modes , as computed in the effective theory , can be simply added up to get the full result .",
    "the analysis of the heavy quarkonium spectrum at @xmath10 _",
    "i.e. _ the third order corrections to the coulomb approximation involves two basic ingredients : the effective hamiltonian and the retardation effect associated with the emission and absorption of dynamical ultrasoft gluons .",
    "the general form of the hamiltonian valid up to n@xmath2lo is given in  @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of the effects resulting from the chromoelectric dipole interaction of the heavy quark - antiquark pair to the ultrasoft gluons relevant for perturbative bound - state calculations at n@xmath2lo can be found in @xcite .    for vanishing angular momentum we can write the energy level of the principal quantum number @xmath11 as @xmath12 where the leading order coulomb energy is @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 stands for corrections of order @xmath15 .",
    "the first and second order corrections can be found in @xcite for arbitrary @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath16 corrections to the energy levels arise from several sources : ( i ) matrix elements of the n@xmath2lo operators of the effective hamiltonian between coulomb wave functions ; ( ii ) higher iterations of the nlo and nnlo operators of the effective hamiltonian in time - independent perturbation theory ; ( iii ) matrix elements of the n@xmath2lo instantaneous operators generated by the emission and absorption of ultrasoft gluons ; and ( iv ) the retarded ultrasoft contribution .",
    "the contributions to @xmath17 for vanishing @xmath18-function were computed for general @xmath11 in @xcite . the corresponding correction to the ground state energy",
    "gets contributions from all four sources and reads @xmath19{a_1}\\right . }",

    "the nonperturbative effects in the case of the top quark are negligible , however , the effect of the top quark width has to be taken into account properly  @xcite as the relatively large width smears out the coulomb - like resonances below the threshold .",
