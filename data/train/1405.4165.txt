    "recent observations have established that star - forming ( sf ) galaxies show a tight correlation between stellar mass ( @xmath7 ) and star - formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "this sfr@xmath7 correlation ( so - called sf main sequence ) is investigated in the local universe ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , as well as in the distant universe out to @xmath8 ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the sfr at a fixed mass evolves with time , reflecting the cosmic star formation history .",
    "the presence of this tight sfr@xmath7 correlation suggests that stellar mass has always been an important parameter that regulates sf activity in galaxies across cosmic time .",
    "the scatter around the sf main sequence is reported to be very small ( @xmath50.3  dex level at any redshifts ) , but the deviation around the sf main sequence may be an important parameter as it is likely to reflect the variation of gas accretion / exaustion history of galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "some recent studies attempt to identify the origin of the scatter and the key parameter that makes the strongest impact on galaxy evolution .",
    "for example , @xcite studied how the galaxy structure and the mode of sf activity depend on the position on the sfr@xmath7 diagram .",
    "they find that the upper envelope of the sf main sequence tends to be dominated by dusty galaxies ( characterized by high sfr@xmath9/sfr@xmath10 ratio ) with high sersic index ( _ n _ ) , suggesting a rapid build - up of mass in the nuclear regions of these systems , due to e.g. galaxy - galaxy interactions / mergers .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we use photometric redshifts ( @xmath11 ) to select non - h@xmath1-emitting passive members ( with strong 4000  break ) which can not be identified with the above h@xmath1 emitter selection .",
    "we here restrict the sample to those detected at @xmath122@xmath13 level with at least four bands out of the six broad - band images ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the best - fit photometric redshifts are computed with a simple template fitting following the standard @xmath15 minimizing statistics using eazy code ( @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of the derived @xmath11 is shown in fig .",
    "the photometric redshifts derived with only six broad - band filters may not be very accurate , but it is worth mentioning that there is a clear redshift spike at @xmath11@xmath61.5 near the radio galaxy ( top panel of fig.[fig : zphot_histogram ] ) . in the following analysis",
    ", we apply a photo-@xmath16 cut of @xmath17 ( dotted lines in fig.[fig : zphot_histogram ] ) to select member galaxies associated to the radio galaxy . with this criteria ,",

    "[ fig : color_select ] ( black circles ) , most of the photo-@xmath16 selected galaxies satisfy the _ bzk _ and _ rjk _ criteria .",
    "unfortunately , we can not fully quantify the photo-@xmath16 accuracy because no spec-@xmath16 information is available in the observed field .",
    "however , we emphasize that our results do not change even if we apply simple color selections without relying on the photometric redshift .",
    "we here crudely test the contamination level by using the ukidss / uds data , where @xmath18 data are publicly available ( @xcite ) . after applying the same magnitude cuts , we derive photo-@xmath16 of the uds galaxies in the same way as described above .",
    "we find that @xmath62250 galaxies ( out of @xmath625000 sources ) satisfy the @xmath17 criteria over the entire @xmath60.8  deg@xmath19 uds field , yielding the expected contamination rate of @xmath60.8 arcmin@xmath20 .",
    "based on this estimate , we expect @xmath60.6 galaxies in the central 250 kpc region .",
    "therefore , the central 250 kpc region of 4c65.22 field is indeed over - dense by a factor of @xmath630@xmath21 compared to the control field ( see also   4 ) .",
    "we also expect @xmath622 galaxies within 4@xmath227@xmath23 moircs fov .",
    "the number density of the photo-@xmath16 members in the 4c65.22 field is still significantly higher than general field ( by a factor of @xmath63@xmath21 ) , but this analysis suggests that the over - density is diluted when averaged over the fov .    for star - forming galaxies , the photometric redshifts may be much less reliable because of their flat featureless broad - band seds .",
    "we find that only 20 h@xmath1 emitters ( 45% ) satisfy the photo-@xmath16 criteria of 1.3@xmath24@xmath11@xmath241.7 ( see blue - hatched histograms in fig.[fig : zphot_histogram ] ) .",
    "in particular , we find that the photometric redshift does not work well for h@xmath1 emitters with red optical colors , and that the photo-@xmath16 errors of such red emitters tend to be slightly larger than those of blue emitters .",
    "this probably reflects the well - known age / dust degeneracy , making it extremely difficult to construct a complete sample of sf galaxies using a limited set of broad - band filters .",
    "we remind the readers that this point is an important advantage of the narrow - band survey : it allows us to construct a clean star - forming galaxy sample within a narrow redshift slice at a high completeness level ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the case of our current dataset ,",
    "@xmath655% of sf galaxies might have been missed out with the photo-@xmath16 selection alone , but those galaxies are now _ rescued _ with our nb - based approach .    in summary , we selected the final member galaxies with the following two criteria",

    "based on the sample selection described in   3 , we here report the discovery of a strong over - density of @xmath3 galaxies around the radio galaxy 4c65.22 . in fig .",

    "the member galaxies on the red sequence ( @xmath29 ; see   4.2 ) are marked with red symbols .",
    "it is evident that there is a clear density peak of @xmath3 galaxies near the radio galaxy . the radio galaxy ( shown with yellow star in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ) is located at @xmath30140 kpc away from the density peak , not in the very center of the core .",

    "[ fig : zphot_histogram ] a clear redshift spike at @xmath31 within @xmath4@xmath24250  kpc from the density peak .",
    "this result does not change even if we consider `` all '' member galaxies including h@xmath1 emitters .",
    "the number density of all the member galaxies ( i.e. photo-@xmath16 member and h@xmath1 emitters ) within the 250  kpc circle is 28.9  arcmin@xmath32 , which is a factor of @xmath1210@xmath21 higher than the average in the outer field ( 2.3 arcmin@xmath20 ) .",
    "we note that a small @xmath11 peak at @xmath3 can also be seen in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : zphot_histogram ] .",
    "this probably reflects the presence of large - scale structures extending beyond the 250  kpc circle .",
    "although we need spectroscopic follow - up observation for confirming such relatively poor structures , it is highly possible that some of the small groups as well as the filamentary structures traced by h@xmath1 emitters seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] are really associated to the central cluster .",
    "another important result drawn from fig .  [ fig : map ] is that the cluster central region ( @xmath4@xmath5250 kpc ) is clearly dominated by red - sequence galaxies without h@xmath1 emission ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : image ] for a three - color representation of our @xmath33 images in the central cluster region ) .",
    "interestingly , this `` suppression radius '' of @xmath6200  kpc is consistent with that reported in another x - ray selected rich cluster at a similar redshift ( e.g.  @xcite ) , suggesting this newly discovered system is a well - evolved rich galaxy cluster at @xmath2 .",
    "the presence of a number of h@xmath1 emitters ( at @xmath34 ) surrounding the core further supports our discovery of the rich cluster associated to the radio galaxy .",
    "we note that no extended x - ray emission is reported in this field so far ; e.g. by the rosat all - sky cluster survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is not surprising given the shallowness of the all - sky survey data .",
    "however , it would be highly possible that we can detect an extended x - ray emission associated with this cluster if we can perform a deep x - ray follow - up observation in the future .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : colmag ] , we show color  magnitude diagrams for galaxies located at @xmath4@xmath24250  kpc and those outside this annulus .",
    "an interesting feature recognized in this plot is the clear `` deficit '' of blue galaxies in the central cluster region ( @xmath4@xmath24250  kpc ) , in stark contrast to the outer field .",
    "there still exist a few h@xmath1 emitters within the @xmath35250  kpc circle , but these h@xmath1 emitting galaxies in the cluster core region show redder colors than typical h@xmath1 emitters in the field environment . this clear lack of low - mass blue galaxies may represent an accelerated galaxy evolution in high-@xmath16 cluster environments ; it is most likely explained that blue sf galaxies falling into the cluster are quickly transformed into red / massive quiescent population .",
    "it is also likely that the quenching process accompanies a quick mass growth via e.g. mergers or galaxy  galaxy interactions , otherwise we can not fully explain the deficit of low - mass blue galaxies _ and _ the excess of red massive galaxies in the cluster core region at the same time . in fig .",
    "[ fig : colmag ] , the red sequence is only visible in its bright end , consistent with some recent studies of @xmath36 clusters ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of the faint end of the red sequence is unlikely due to the selection effect : we verified that the number of faint red galaxies does not increase even if we use @xmath37-band detected catalog instead of nb - selected catalog .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction ] the cumulative ( and differential ) fraction of each population in our total sample as a function of the distance from the density peak out to @xmath351  mpc .",
    "this plot further supports our claim that red galaxies are strongly clustered within @xmath38250  kpc .",
    "it is evident that the fraction of red galaxies sharply drops at @xmath39kpc , which coincides with the place where we see the dramatical increase in h@xmath1 emitters and blue galaxies .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( ks - test ) suggests with @xmath1299.9% confidence level that the distributions of red galaxies and h@xmath1 emitters ( or blue galaxies ) are drawn from a different parent population .",
    "we therefore conclude that most of blue star - forming galaxies falling into the highest - density cluster core are forced to migrate toward the red sequence , resulting in the clear deficit of low - mass blue galaxies in the central part of this cluster .",
    "using the newly discovered cluster field as a laboratory , we here take a more detailed look at the environmental dependence of galaxy properties at @xmath3 . for each member galaxy , we calculate the local surface number density ( @xmath41 ) , where @xmath42 denotes the distance to the fifth - nearest neighbor of each member galaxy . in the following analysis of this paper",
    ", we use this local density @xmath43 as an environmental index , but our results do not change even if we use @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "we first focus on galaxy colors . in fig.[fig : color_density ] ( left ) , we show @xmath46 ( rest - frame @xmath47 ) colors of member galaxies as a function of @xmath43 .",
    "this plot clearly demonstrates that the color  density relation is already in place at @xmath3 , consistent with the visual impression from fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] .",
    "we here compute the spearman s rank correlation coefficient ( @xmath48 ) . with a sample size of @xmath49@xmath5084",
    ", we can conclude that there is a significant correlation between the two variables : a null hypothesis that there is no correlation between @xmath46 and @xmath43 is ruled out at @xmath1299% confidence level .",
    "the correlation becomes much less significant when we consider only h@xmath1 emitters . in this case , the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is @xmath51 . with a sample size of @xmath52",
    ", we can not rule out a null hypothesis that there is no significant correlation between @xmath46 and @xmath43 for h@xmath1 emitters .",
    "therefore we suggest that the color  density relation is primarily driven by passive red galaxies in the highest - density cluster core , equivalently by the lack of blue galaxies in the highest - density region .",
    "we note , however , that there is a weak correlation between the ew(h@xmath1+[nii ] ) and galaxy colors in the sense that redder h@xmath1 emitters tend to have lower ew ( see blue squares in fig .  8 , where we use different symbol size for high - ew / low - ew emitters ) .",
    "in other words , our definition of the h@xmath1 emitters ( @xmath53nb1657@xmath120.2 ) may potentially fail to select low - ew ( red ) h@xmath1 emitters .",
    "therefore we need to keep in mind that the results on the color  density relation amongst h@xmath1 emitters could be highly sensitive to the ew cut used for the sample selection .",
    "it is possible that the color ",
    "density relation is partly produced by the correlation between galaxy stellar mass and environment .",
    "we here investigate the environmental dependence of stellar masses ( @xmath7 ) of the member galaxies .",

    "@xmath57 where @xmath58 indicates the @xmath59 correction value .",
    "these conversion equations are derived using the model galaxies developed by @xcite assuming @xcite imf .",
    "it is demonstrated that this `` one - color method '' can provide reasonable @xmath7 values out to @xmath60 ( see @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : color_density ] ( right ) , we plot the derived @xmath7 as a function of @xmath43 .",
    "our data suggest that there exists a weak @xmath7density relation in the observed field , again driven by the massive galaxies in the highest - density cluster core . by computing the spearman",
    "s rank correlation coefficient ( @xmath61 ) , and with a sample size of @xmath6284 , we can rule out the null hypothesis that there is no @xmath7@xmath43 relationship with @xmath3097% confidence level . however , if we focus only on the h@xmath1 emitters , the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is @xmath51 , suggesting no significant correlation between the two variables with the sample size of @xmath52 .",
    "our data thus suggest that the color  density and @xmath7density relation are already in place at @xmath3 , mostly driven by passive red / massive galaxies in the highest - density region .",
    "however , the correlations almost disappear when we consider only sf galaxies .",
    "an important advantage of the nb h@xmath1 survey is that we can measure h@xmath1 flux of all emitters within the observed fov .",
    "we here describe how we derive the h@xmath1-based sfrs of h@xmath1 emitters , and then describe how the derived sfrs depend on environment .",

    "we correct for the  line contribution into the total nb fluxes , using the empirical calibration between /(h@xmath1",
    "+ ) flux ratio and ew@xmath65(h@xmath1 + ) for local sdss galaxies presented by @xcite .",
    "the median of the derived /(h@xmath1",
    "+ ) ratio for our h@xmath1 emitter sample is 0.19 , consistent with the h@xmath1 emitter sample at @xmath83 ( /(h@xmath1+)@xmath500.22 ) shown by @xcite .",
    "although there remains a large scatter around this relation ( @xmath60.4  dex ; e.g. @xcite ) , it is impossible to measure [ nii ] line flux for all galaxies because it requires deep spectroscopic observation for all of them . therefore our procedure is the best effort at this moment , and at least it would be more realistic than the convensional constant ( e.g.  30% ) correction .",
    "we then compute the dust - free h@xmath1-based star formation rates , sfr@xmath84 , using the @xcite relation for @xcite imf ; sfr@xmath84[@xmath85/yr]@xmath86[ergs@xmath32 ] .",
    "we note that our h@xmath1 emitter selection criteria shown in   3.1 approximately correspond to ew@xmath88(h@xmath1+)@xmath8920  and sfr@xmath84@xmath893@xmath85/yr .    finally , we correct for the dust extinction effect .",
    "we here consider two independent methods to estimate dust extinction at h@xmath1 ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the first method is to use @xmath90@xmath7 relation established for local galaxies by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath90@xmath7 correlation is likely to be unchanged up to @xmath3 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and this method is often used in studies of distant galaxies as a convenient method to predict dust extinction effect for individual galaxies .",
    "the second approach is to use sfr@xmath84/sfr@xmath10 ratio for predicting @xmath90 .",
    "because h@xmath1 is less sensitive to dust extinction effect than rest - frame uv light , the sfr@xmath84/sfr@xmath10 ratio can be used as an indicator of dust attenuation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in our case , the @xmath91-band flux density ( @xmath92@xmath301800 ) can be converted to the rest - frame uv luminosity density , and then we derive sfr@xmath10 using @xcite calibration ; sfr@xmath10@xmath501.4@xmath2110@xmath93[ergs@xmath32hz@xmath32 ] .",
    "the observed sfr@xmath84/sfr@xmath10 ratio is translated to the dust extinction value using the following equation : @xmath94 @xmath95 we here adopt @xmath96@xmath503.33 and @xmath97@xmath509.37 from @xcite law with @xmath98@xmath504.05 .",
    "one thing we need to treat carefully is an extra extinction toward the nebular regions ( @xmath99 value in the above equations ) . in the @xcite prescription ,",
    "the @xmath99 value was shown to be 0.44 ( i.e.  @xmath100 ) .",
    "however , recent studies claim that this @xmath99 value is likely to be different for high-@xmath16 sf galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) . @xcite empirically linked the sfr@xmath84/sfr@xmath10 ratio to @xmath101 for @xmath102 sf galaxies .",
    "they derived the best - fitted value of @xmath103 , and we adopt this value to our analysis .",
    "we note that the method may not be perfect enough ( e.g. sfr@xmath84/sfr@xmath10 flux ratio could depend on galactic age ; see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) , but we expect this method is more realistic than the simple @xmath7-dependent correction shown above .            in fig .",

    "it may be interesting to note that there is a large scatter around the @xmath90@xmath7 relation , and that there exist some exceptionally dusty galaxies with @xmath90@xmath893  mag , which can not be identified with the simple @xmath7-dependent correction emitters showing @xmath90@xmath104 ( i.e.  sfr@xmath84/sfr@xmath10@xmath105 ) .",
    "one of these sources ( id#930 ) is consistent with @xmath90@xmath106 within its error bar ( probably a dust - free galaxy ) , whilst the other source ( id#13 ) shows an unrealistic negative @xmath90 value .",

    "[ fig : map_ms ] the @xmath110ms values as a function of the distance to the nearest neighboring member galaxy ( @xmath120 ) . in this plot",
    ", we find a tentative hint that galaxies having a close companion ( with @xmath5200  kpc ) tend to show a larger scatter around the main sequence , whilst isolated galaxies tend to be located on the main sequence .",

    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , because of the mixture of bursty / normal / passive population , we can not detect an environmental variation in the location ( or zero point ) of the sf main sequence .",
    "it has been a long observational challenge to find a galaxy cluster at @xmath122 until recently .",
    "however , an increasing number of studies have identified clusters at such frontier redshifts with various techniques ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the nature of such high-@xmath16 clusters and their member galaxies are now being investigated .",
    "some studies point out that sf activity in high-@xmath16 cluster cores are comparable to ( or even higher than ) general field galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; hence galaxy clusters at these redshifts are interpreted as being in the `` transitional phase '' or final quenching period ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , our newly discovered cluster reported in this paper resembles more like @xmath123 clusters , characterized by a strong concentration of passive red galaxies in the cluster center and star - forming population surrounding the core ( e.g.  @xcite ; 2011 ) .",
    "our finding of the suppressed sf activity in the cluster core is also similar to the situation in the well - studied rich cluster xmmuj2235.3@xmath1242557 at @xmath125 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite studied an x - ray detected @xmath126 group in chandra deep field south .",
    "based on the sed and morphological analyses using the candels data , these authors suggest that most galaxies in this @xmath127 group are quiescent early - type systems ( with a few of them specroscopically confirmed ) .",
    "the size of the spatial extension of quiescent galaxies in the system reported by @xcite is also qualitatively consistent with that of our newly discovered system at @xmath2 ( @xmath6200300  kpc scale ) .    in our current work , by utilizing the narrow - band h@xmath1 imaging technique , we find a clear `` deficit '' of blue galaxies in the central cluster region ( @xmath4@xmath24250  kpc ) .",
    "we do find a few h@xmath1 emitters within the @xmath35250  kpc circle , but those h@xmath1 emitting galaxies in the cluster core show redder colors than typical blue h@xmath1 emitters seen in general field environment (   4.2 ) .",
    "we anticipate that the clear lack of low - mass blue galaxies in the cluster central region is due to the rapid sf quenching and rapid mass growth triggered by environmental effects .",
    "if a low - mass blue galaxy enters a rich cluster environment , its sf activity will soon be quenched .",
    "this quenching mechanism should accompany an intense short - lived starburst or merging event , because the red - sequence galaxies dominating the cluster core tend to be much more massive than typical blue sf galaxies in the surrounding field .",
    "the color ",
    "density relation has been investigated out to @xmath36 or even beyond ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our data suggest that the color  density relation is already in place around the radio galaxy at @xmath3 .",
    "however , the correlation becomes much weaker once we remove non - h@xmath1-emitting galaxies , suggesting that the color  density relation is a product of passive red - sequence galaxies dominating the highest - density cluster core .",
    "a similar result was drawn from morphological analysis of cluster / field galaxies at @xmath127 by @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that the morphologies of sf galaxies in cluster and field environments at @xmath127 show no significant difference .",
    "we note , however , that our data covers only a limited fov ( 2.0@xmath213.6 mpc@xmath19 ) , and it is possible that we do not sample galaxies in very low - density environments .",
    "we also note that the definition of the h@xmath1 emitters in this study is ew@xmath65(h@xmath1@xmath129[nii])@xmath8920 , which might be too large if we consider local sf galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) . at @xmath3",
    ", however , it is expected that the ew@xmath65(h@xmath1@xmath129[nii])@xmath8920    criterion allows us to select a fairly complete sample of normal main - sequence galaxies .",
    "therefore we do not expect that the ew cut does not make any strong impacts on our results , but we need to keep in mind that our survey can potentially miss low - ew ( but still star - forming ) galaxies .",
    "this is an inevitable problem associated with any nb - based study , and we need future deep imaging / spectroscopic observations to construct a more complete sample of galaxies down to such less active population .",
    "it is worth mentioning that recent studies on @xmath130 proto - clusters suggest that sf galaxies in higher - density environments tend to have redder colors , implying a color  density correlation _ amongst star - forming galaxies _ ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that most of h@xmath1 emitters with red @xmath131 colors in the core of the pks1138262 proto - cluster at @xmath132 are very massive system ( with @xmath133 ) .",
    "such an accelerated galaxy stellar mass growth is also suggested by some recent studies on @xmath8 proto - clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in our current analysis",
    ", we find a number of red massive galaxies _ without star formation _ in the core of the @xmath3 cluster .",
    "the stellar masses of these passive population are comparable to those of massive sf galaxies in the @xmath130 proto - cluster enviromnents . if we assume that those massive sf galaxies reported in @xmath130 proto - cluster environments are the direct progenitors of passive red galaxies seen in the @xmath3 cluster core , they are expected to have stopped their sf activity within a relatively short time interval between @xmath60 and @xmath3 .",
    "there have been a lot of debates on the `` reversal '' of the sfr ",
    "density relation in the distant universe .",
    "@xcite first noted this possibility with the multi - wavelength dataset in the goods fields ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this reversal of the sf  density relation is still under debate , and it is likely that the results could be uncertain depending on the sample definitions and/or the definitions of environment ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . at least for star - forming galaxies ,",
    "recent studies have obtained a similar conclusion that there is no significant sfr  density or ssfr  density correlation amongst sf galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; 2012 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the results drawn from our current work is consistent with those recent studies .",
    "we caution that the `` flat '' sfr ",
    "density relation may not hold at @xmath8 . as we demonstrated in @xcite ,",
    "sf galaxies in proto - cluster environments tend to be more massive than those in underdense regions .",
    "although most of the h@xmath1 emitters in proto - cluster environments tend to be located on the sf main sequence , they are skewed to the massive end of the main sequence ; hence their sfrs tend to be higher ( on average ) than those in general field environments .",
    "a vital approach to understanding the environmental effects on sf galaxies is to examine the environmental impacts on the sf main sequence .",
    "recent studies have investigated the sf main sequence mainly for distant _ field _ galaxies .",
    "those studies have confirmed the existence of the sf main sequence out to @xmath134 or above , but the environmental dependence of sf main sequence is much poorly understood due to the lack of well - defined sf galaxy samples in clusters / groups in the distant unverse .    in @xcite , we studied the environmental dependence of the sf main sequence using our purely h@xmath1-selected galaxy samples at @xmath135 in distant cluster environments and general field environments .",
    "we found that there is no significant environmental variation in the sf main sequence out to @xmath60 ( with a difference of @xmath60.2  dex at maximum ) . in that work",
    ", we used @xmath7-dependent extinction correction for all h@xmath1 emitters , which is reported to be unchanged ( at least on average ) throughout the cosmic time ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , we need to test the validity of this procedure by comparing the results derived with different methods of dust extinction correction . in our current analysis",
    ", we test this concern by estimating the h@xmath1 dust extinction in a more realistic way using the sfr@xmath84/sfr@xmath10 ratio .",
    "however , we again find that the location of the sf main sequence does not change with environment ( with a difference of @xmath50.1  dex level ) , confirming the conclusion drawn by @xcite .",
    "we caution , however , that the dust extinction issue is still an important key question to fully assess the real enviromental impacts on the sf main sequence .",
    "indeed , we do find a marginal trend that the dust extinction effect ( @xmath90 ) is weakly correlated with local density in the sense that sf galaxies in higher - density environment tend to be more highly obscured by dust .",
    "a similar implication was obtained for @xmath107 galaxies by @xcite . in that work , we used sfr@xmath9/sfr@xmath84 ratio ( with 24@xmath71 m stacking analysis ) to show that sf galaxies in high - density environments tend to be dustier ( by @xmath60.5  mag level ) than those in underdense environments , in qualitative agreement with the current work .",
    "our studies thus suggest a possibility that sf galaxies surviving in high-@xmath16 cluster environments tend to be dustier , and perhaps the nature / mode of sf activity in cluster environments may be different from those in general field environments .",
    "we recall that the environmental impacts on the dust properties of galaxies are still very pooly understood at this moment , and there are some contradicting results on this issue ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , a special care must be taken on the dust extinction correction when we interprete the environmental dependence of the sf main sequence , and this key issue needs to be studied more in detail with larger galaxy samples in the future .    finally , we comment on the possibility of the environmental impacts on the `` scatter '' of the sf main sequence . as we showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : map_ms ] , we do not find a correlation between @xmath110ms and @xmath43 , consistent with the environmental independence of the location of the main sequence . on the other hand",
    ", we find a tentative hint that the @xmath110ms value more strongly deviates for those having a close companion within @xmath5200  kpc , while more isolated galaxies tend to be more steadily located on the sf main sequence .",
    "the sample is clearly too small to draw any firm conclusion , but this result may provide us with a new insight on the origin of the scatter of the sf main sequence .",
    "if a galaxy approaches another galaxy , their sf activity would be disturbed ( some are boosted and others are truncated ) due to the galaxy - galaxy interaction or halo gas stripping ( satellite quenching ) .",
    "this would explain the larger scatter of the @xmath110ms for those with small @xmath120 , and the apparent environmental independence of the location of the sf main sequence .",
    "we performed a broad - band and narrow - band ( h@xmath1 ) imaging survey of a radio galaxy field ( 4c65.22 ) at @xmath0 over the 7@xmath224@xmath23 fov ( corresponding to 3.6@xmath212.0 mpc@xmath19 ) with moircs / suprime - cam on the subaru telescope .",
    "based on this new dataset , we find a rich cluster candidate around the radio galaxy .",
    "we also studied an environmental dependence of galaxy properties around this newly discovered structure at @xmath3 .",
    "our findings are summarized as the following .",
    "\\(1 ) with the photo-@xmath16 and h@xmath1 emitter selections , we discovered a strong over - density of galaxies around 4c65.22 .",
    "we find that the cluster central region ( @xmath136@xmath5250  kpc from the density peak ) is clearly dominated by passive red - sequence galaxies without h@xmath1 emission , while the h@xmath1-emitting galaxies are preferentially located in the cluster outskirts , showing a sharp decline in the h@xmath1 emitter fraction toward the cluster center .",
    "this spatial segregation is similar to that seen in lower redshift clusters , suggesting that the newly discovered structure is a well - matured system .",
    "\\(2 ) the color  density and @xmath7density relations are already in place at @xmath3 .",
    "these environmental trends are mostly driven by passive red / massive galaxies residing in the cluster central region , whilst such environmental trends become much weaker when we consider only h@xmath1 emitters .",
    "this is also the case for sfr  density and ssfr  density relation .",
    "an excess of non - h@xmath1-emitting red - sequence galaxies in the cluster core strongly suggests that the sf activity is suppressed in the very rich environment at @xmath2 , but the sf activity amongst sf galaxies are almost independent of environment .",
    "\\(3 ) there may exist a weak correlation between dust attenuation ( derived with sfr@xmath84/sfr@xmath10 ratio ) and local environment for sf galaxies at @xmath2 : galaxies in high - density environments tend to be dustier by @xmath60.51.0 mag level .",
    "however , even if we take this point into account , we can not see a detectable environmental variation in the location of the sf main sequence , consistent with recent studies .",
    "we do not find any correlation between the sfr offset from the sf main sequence ( @xmath110ms ) and @xmath43 , but we find a tentative hint that galaxies having a close companion ( at a moderate distance of @xmath5200  kpc ) tend to be more largely scattered from the sf main sequence than more isolated galaxies .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a strong over - density of galaxies in the field of a radio galaxy at @xmath0 ( 4c65.22 ) based on our broad - band and narrow - band ( h@xmath1 ) photometry with subaru telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we find that h@xmath1 emitters are located in the outskirts of the density peak ( cluster core ) dominated by passive red - sequence galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this resembles the situation in lower - redshift clusters , suggesting that the newly discovered structure is a well - evolved rich galaxy cluster at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our data suggest that the color  density and stellar mass  density relations are already in place at @xmath3 , mostly driven by the passive red massive galaxies residing within @xmath4@xmath5200  kpc from the cluster core . </S>",
    "<S> these environmental trends almost disappear when we consider only star - forming ( sf ) galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find sfr  </S>",
    "<S> density or ssfr  density relations amongst sf galaxies , and the location of the sf main sequence does not significantly change with environment . nevertheless , we find a tentative hint that star - bursting galaxies ( up - scattered objects from the main sequence ) are preferentially located in a small group at @xmath61-mpc away from the main body of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue that the scatter of the sf main sequence could be dependent on the distance to the nearest neighboring galaxy . </S>"
