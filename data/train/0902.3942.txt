    "the way shell closures and single - particle energies evolve as functions of the number of nucleons is presently one of the greatest challenges to our understanding of the basic features of nuclei .",
    "doubly - magic nuclei are particularly important and closed shell nuclei like @xmath0ni and @xmath5sn have been the focus of several experiments during the last years  @xcite .",
    "their structure provides important information on theoretical interpretations and our basic understanding of matter .",
    "in particular , recent experiments  @xcite have aimed at extracting information about single - particle degrees of freedom in the vicinity of @xmath0ni .",
    "experimental information from single - nucleon transfer reactions and magnetic moments @xcite , can be used to extract and interpret complicated many - body wave functions in terms effective single - particle degrees of freedom .",
    "transfer reactions provide for example information about the angular distributions , the excitation energies and the spectroscopic factors of possible single - particles states .",
    "if one can infer from experimental data that a single - particle picture is a viable starting point for interpreting a closed - shell nucleus like @xmath0ni , one can use this nucleus as a basis for constructing valence - space effective interactions .",
    "these interactions can in turn be used in shell - model calculations of nuclei with several valence nucleons above the @xmath6 and @xmath7 filled shells of @xmath0ni .",
    "recent measurements of spectroscopic factors of @xmath4ni in high - energy knockout reactions  @xcite seem to indicate that low - lying states in @xmath4ni can be characterized as single - particle states on top of @xmath0ni as a closed - core nucleus .",
    "large - scale shell - model calculations by horoi _",
    "@xcite corroborate these findings , whereas a recent experiment on magnetic moments of the ground state of @xmath4cu @xcite , expected to be described as one valence proton outside @xmath0ni , resulted in much smaller moments than those expected from a single - particle picture .",
    "similarly , large transition matrix elements between the @xmath8 ground state and the first excited @xmath9 state indicate that the @xmath0ni core is rather soft @xcite , or stated differently , it implies a rather fragmented single - particle picture . on the other hand",
    ", one ought keep in mind that quenchings of spectroscopic factors to about 60% are common even for good closed shell nuclei  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , spectroscopic factors are defined as the ratio of the observed reaction rate with respect to the same rate calculated assuming a full occupation of the relevant single - particle states .",
    "they are therefore often interpreted as a measure of the occupancy of a specific single - particle state . however , from a strict theoretical point of view spectroscopic factors are not occupation numbers but a measure of what fraction of the full wave function can be factorized into a correlated state ( often chosen to be a given closed - shell core ) and an independent single - particle or single - hole state .",
    "large deviations from the values predicted by an independent - particle model , point to a strongly correlated system . in this regime ,",
    "collective excitations that behave like single - particle degrees of freedom  that is _ quasiparticles_can still arise .",
    "the above mentioned large - scale shell - model calculations @xcite have been performed in one major shell , the @xmath2-shell , with an effective interaction fitted to reproduce properties of several nuclei that can be interpreted in terms of these single - particle states .",
    "the number of possible slater determinants that can be constructed when distributing eight valence protons and eight valence nucleons in the @xmath2 shell is more than @xmath10 .",
    "this means that the inclusion of more complicated particle - hole excitations from shells below and above the @xmath2 shell , are well beyond present capabilities of large - scale diagonalization methods  @xcite .",
    "the hope is that an effective interaction tailored to one major shell includes as many as possible of these neglected particle - hole excitations .",
    "however , there are other many - body methods that allow for a computational scheme which accounts for a systematic inclusion of more complicated many - body corrections",
    ". typical examples of such many - body methods are coupled - cluster methods  @xcite , various types of monte carlo methods  @xcite , perturbative many - body expansions  @xcite , self - consistent green s functions ( scgf ) methods  @xcite , the density - matrix renormalization group  @xcite and _ ab initio _ density functional theory  @xcite , just to mention some of the available methods .    the green s function monte carlo method @xcite and the no - core shell - model approach @xcite have been successfully applied to the theoretical description of light nuclei with mass numbers @xmath11 , and hamiltonians based on nucleon - nucleon and three - nucleon interactions . however",
    ", present experimental studies of nuclear stabilities are now being pushed to larger mass regions , with mass numbers from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "traditionally , this has been the realm of the nuclear shell - model and nuclear density - functional theory .",
    "these methods employ hamiltonians and density functionals with phenomenological corrections and are not directly related to the vacuum nucleon - nucleon interaction employed in _ ab initio _ calculations ( exceptions are found when perturbative many - body methods are used @xcite ) .",
    "however , in selected medium - mass nuclei , _ ab initio _ structure calculations can be performed using approaches like coupled - cluster and green s functions theories .",
    "these methods allow studying ground- and excited - state properties of systems with dimensionalities beyond the capability of present large - scale diagonalization approaches , with a much smaller numerical effort when compared to diagonalization methods aiming at similar accuracies .",
    "the accuracy of these methods is sufficiently high to attribute an eventual disagreement between experimental data and theoretical results to missing physics in the hamiltonian . in this way",
    ", such calculations help to increase our understanding of the nuclear interaction on a very fundamental level .",
    "recent coupled - cluster calculations  @xcite have reported practically converged results of the ground state of medium - mass nuclei like @xmath14ca , @xmath15ni and @xmath15ca using the bare chiral interaction n@xmath1lo  @xcite .",
    "these calculations employed a harmonic oscillator basis to construct the single - particle basis and included correlations of the so - called singles and doubles types .",
    "it means that one - particle - one - hole and two - particle - two - hole correlations acting on a many - body slater determinant were summed to infinite order .",
    "recently , results with three - particle - three - hole correlations have also been obtained  @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed in a harmonic oscillator basis containing up to fifteen major shells and resulted in basically converged ground state properties for a given hamiltonian .",
    "another method with a strong potential for performing _ ab initio _ calculations of nuclei beyond @xmath16 is self - consistent green s functions theory . differently from the coupled - cluster and no - core shell model ,",
    "this method does not construct the wave function but evaluates directly the energies and transition matrix elements for the transfer of one or more nucleons .",
    "another important point is that the self - energy ",
    "the central component of the formalism  has been shown to be an exact optical potential .",
    "on the one hand , one can employ the formalism for pure _ ab initio _ studies .",
    "on the other , the strong link with the response to experimental probes can be used to constrain and improve phenomenological models .",
    "an example of this approach is the dispersive optical model recently derived for chain of calcium isotopes  @xcite .",
    "this global optical potential reproduces with high accuracy the known elastic scattering data , up to energies of 200  mev .",
    "thus , green s functions hold a promise of _ both _ bridging nuclear structure and reactions and for connecting the ( relatively few ) isotopes amenable of _ ab initio _ calculations to the rest of the nuclear landscape .    in practical applications of green s functions theory ,",
    "one expands the self - energy in terms of resummations of feynman diagrams and truncates the series in a way that allows for further systematic improvements of the formalism .",
    "a powerful scheme for non - perturbative expansions is the so called faddeev random phase approximation ( frpa ) that explicitly accounts for particle - vibration couplings  @xcite .",
    "first applications of this approach were devoted to @xmath17o .",
    "one single calculation yielded the basic information to be used for microscopic studies of spectroscopic factors  @xcite , the excitation spectrum  @xcite , two - nucleon emission  @xcite and the nucleon - nucleus optical potential  @xcite .",
    "thus , the frpa method pursues a global description of the many - body dynamics , far beyond ground state properties alone .",
    "another difference with the coupled - cluster approach is that green s functions allow , via a diagrammatic approach , to directly introduce the correlations outside the model space that are associated with short - range degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "it can therefore be applied to interactions with strong short - range cores ( for example , the argonne model  @xcite was employed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "self - consistent frpa calculations of @xmath17o were first performed by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , and subsequently extended to fully _ ab initio _ calculations in spaces up to eight oscillator shells  @xcite . to our knowledge , the combination of the random phase approximation phonons and the proper treatment of the energy dependence of the interaction vertex , makes this the most accurate evaluation of single - particle states available for this nucleus . in this work",
    "we extend the range of applications of this formalism to studies of quasiparticle states around @xmath0ni , as a first application of faddeev random phase approximation to @xmath2 shell nuclei .",
    "as mentioned above , there is quite some experimental interest in single - particle properties around @xmath0ni .",

    "the object of interest is the single - particle propagator , instead of the many - body wave function . in the following",
    ", greek indices @xmath18 label the orthonormal basis set of single - particle states included in the model space , while latin indices @xmath19 refer to many - body states .",
    "we employ the convention of summing over repeated indices , unless specified otherwise .",
    "the single - particle propagator can be written in the so - called lehmann representation as  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21   ( @xmath22 ) are the spectroscopic amplitudes , @xmath23  ( @xmath24 ) are the second quantization annihilation ( creation ) operators and @xmath25  ( @xmath26 ) . with these definitions ,",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are the eigenstates , while @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the corresponding energies of the ( @xmath31)-nucleon system .",
    "therefore , the poles of the single - particle propagator reflect the energy transfer observed in pickup and knockout reactions .",
    "the single - particle propagator @xmath32 enters the dyson equation as @xmath33 it depends on the irreducible self - energy @xmath34 .",
    "the latter can be written as the sum of two terms .",
    "the first terms describes the average mean - field ( mf ) while the second term contains dynamic correlations , @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dys ] ) , @xmath36 is the so - called unperturbed single - propagator , corresponding to nucleons moving under the effect of the kinetic energy part of the total hamiltonian .",
    "the localization of the single - particle states in the nuclear mean - field is due to the term @xmath37 , which extends the hartree - fock potential to that of a fully correlated density matrix .",
    "the term @xmath38 represents the antisymmetrized matrix elements of the nucleon - nucleon interaction . in this work ,",
    "these will be approximated by an effective interaction , eq .",

    "( [ eq : sigma1 ] ) introduces the two - particle - one - hole ( _ 2p1h _ ) and two - hole - one - particle ( _ 2h1p _ ) irreducible propagator @xmath39 . in its feynman expansion",
    ", this propagator contains all diagrams with any number of particle and hole lines _ except _ those that allow the intermediate propagation of one single line .",
    "it can therefore be interpreted as carrying the complete information on all configurations that can not be reduced to a nucleon interacting with the average nuclear field . in particular",
    ", it includes the coupling of single - particle states to collective vibrations like giant resonances .",
    "the theoretical spectroscopic factors @xmath40 and @xmath41 for removal and addition , respectively , of a nucleon , are given by the normalization integral of the corresponding overlap wave functions .",

    "it must be stressed that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dys ] ) and  ( [ eq : sigma1 ] ) do not involve any approximation .",
    "therefore , the full knowledge of @xmath37 and @xmath39 would be equivalent to the exact solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "in practical calculations , it is always necessary to truncate the full space of available single - particle states to a finite model space and to select a limited set of many - body correlations .",
    "the approximations employed in the present work to evaluate these quantities are discussed in the rest of this section .",
    "the present calculations were performed within a large but finite set of harmonic oscillator states , including single - particle states up to ten major shells . in order to treat the short - range part of the nucleon - nucleon interaction ,",
    "one must resum explicitly the series of ladder diagrams for two nucleons outside this model space .",
    "these contributions are included in the self - energy in two different ways .",
    "firstly , they are explicitly added to the mean - field part , @xmath37 , in order to reconstruct the contribution of short - range correlations in the full hilbert space .",
    "secondly , they are included in a regularized effective hamiltonian which is used to calculate the long - range part of correlations  described by @xmath39inside the chosen model space .",
    "this approach leads to calculating the well known @xmath46-matrix  @xcite , which is then used as an energy dependent effective interaction inside the model space   in which _ all _ states belonging to the model space are pauli blocked since diagrams among them are already included in the many - body calculation of @xmath39 . ] . in this case",
    "the @xmath37 part of the self - energy will also depend on energy .",
    "this is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the matrix elements of the @xmath46-matrix interaction .",
    "( [ eq : h_bhf ] ) differs from the standard brueckner - hartree - fock potential in the fact that the mean - field is not represented by a set of independent nucleons filling various orbits .",
    "rather , the medium is described by the hole spectroscopic amplitudes @xmath49 that lead to the fully correlated density matrix .",
    "since the latter are obtained by solving the dyson equation , they must be obtained iteratively in a self - consistent way . whenever the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma1 ] ) is neglected , this procedure simply reduces to solving the standard brueckner - hartree - fock equations .",
    "however , as soon as the response of the medium @xmath39 is accounted for , the single - particle propagator becomes fragmented and @xmath37 describes the interaction of a particle with the `` correlated '' medium .",
    "we remind that using the @xmath46-matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_bhf ] ) corresponds to summing the mean - field term form eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma1 ] ) and ladder diagrams with intermediate two - particle states outside the chosen model space .",
    "this partitioning procedure has two main consequences .",
    "first , the effects of short - range physics at the two - body level on the total energy are included in the renormalized interaction .",
    "this leads to a softer force that can be applied within a `` low - momentum '' model space . secondly , due to the explicit energy dependence",
    ", the term @xmath50 contributes as well to the normalization of spectroscopic factors , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sf ] ) .",
    "this provides a natural way to determine the amount of strength that the free interaction would admix into configurations outside the model space , see for example the discussion of refs .",
    "thus , the present approach differs from methods based on the renormalization group , where instead an explicit renormalization of the effective operators would be required  @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath46-matrix becomes cumbersome in calculating the polarization propagator .",
    "we define therefore a static effective interaction for our model space to be used in our calculations of the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma1 ] ) . to do this we evaluate the average energy for the _ harmonic oscillator _ single - particle states according to @xmath51 where the sum is limited to those states that correspond to filled orbits in the independent particle model .",

    "the polarization propagator @xmath39 can be expanded in terms of simpler green s functions that involve the propagation of one or more quasiparticle states .",
