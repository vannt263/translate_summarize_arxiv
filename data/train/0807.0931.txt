    "systems consisting of a single atom coupled to a high - finesse optical cavity are of fundamental importance to quantum optics and quantum information science .",
    "such cavity qed systems have been experimentally implemented using neutral atoms @xcite and ions @xcite , and have been the subject of numerous theoretical studies @xcite . in particular , such systems play a key role in proposals for scalable quantum computation @xcite and distributed quantum networks @xcite .",
    "an important requirement for many of these proposals is the ability to coherently control the internal and motional degrees of freedom of the trapped atom , and raman transitions provide the means for meeting this requirement .",
    "raman transitions are powerful tools that have diverse applications in atomic physics , including spectroscopy @xcite , precision measurement @xcite , and coherent state manipulation @xcite , and have been used to coherently control the motional degrees of freedom of trapped ions @xcite and of neutral atoms trapped in optical lattices @xcite . until recently",
    ", however , raman transitions had not been incorporated into cavity qed .",
    "the practical challenge of implementing a free - space raman scheme in cavity qed lies in the presence of the cavity itself , which offers limited optical access to the atom within , especially in the strong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "as first proposed in @xcite , these optical access limitations can be circumvented by implementing a cavity - based raman scheme , in which the raman coupling is generated by standing - wave fields inside the cavity .    in this paper",
    ", we provide the theoretical background behind two such cavity - based schemes for driving raman transitions between the hyperfine ground state manifolds of a single atom optically trapped within a high - finesse cavity .",
    "both schemes have been recently implemented and validated experimentally , and have been used to extend the trapping lifetime of a near - resonantly driven atom @xcite , to cool the axial motion of an atom to the quantum ground state of its trapping potential @xcite , and to optically pump an atom into a specific zeeman state @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : trapping ] , we describe how a single atom is trapped inside the cavity by means of an optical dipole trap . in section [ sec : raman - three - level ] , we present the two schemes for driving raman transitions in the trapped atom . we treat the atom using a three - level model , and show that the internal and motional degrees of freedom of the atom can be described using an effective hamiltonian that has the same form for both schemes . in section [ sec : quantize - axial ] ,",
    "we quantize the axial motion of the atom , and show how the raman couplings allow one to drive transitions that change the vibrational quantum number for motion along the cavity axis .",
    "we present both analytic results , which apply to atoms that are sufficiently cold , and numerical results , which apply to atoms of arbitrary temperature . in section [ sec : raman - cesium ] , we describe how the raman couplings are modified when we take into account the multiplicity of levels in a physically realistic cesium atom .",
    "we show that the raman schemes drive transitions between individual zeeman states in the two hyperfine ground state manifolds , and we derive the rabi frequencies for these zeeman transitions . finally , in section [ sec : cooling ] , we show how raman transitions can be used to cool the axial motion of the atom to the quantum ground state , and we present computer simulations of the cooling process .",
    "the optical cavity we will be considering consists of two symmetric mirrors separated by a distance @xmath0 ( details of the cavity are given in appendix [ sec : cavity - mode - structure ] ) .",
    "an atom is trapped inside the cavity by means of a far off - resonance trap ( fort ) , which is created by driving one of the cavity modes with light that is red - detuned from a dipole transition in the atom .",
    "the red - detuned light forms a standing wave inside the cavity , and the coupling of the atom to the light causes it to be attracted to the points of maximum intensity in the standing wave .    the operation of the fort can be understood by considering a simple two - level model in which the atom has a single ground state @xmath1 and a single excited state @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the frequency of the @xmath4 transition , and let @xmath5 denote the frequency of the fort light .",
    "we will assume that the fort resonantly drives mode @xmath6 of the cavity , so @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the free spectral range . the hamiltonian for the system is @xmath9 where @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the position of the atom , @xmath12 is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the shape of the cavity mode ( see appendix [ sec : cavity - mode - structure ] ) , and @xmath13 is the rabi frequency of the light at a point of maximum intensity . we can simplify this hamiltonian by making the rotating wave approximation and then performing a unitary transformation to eliminate the time dependence : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the detuning of the fort from the atom ( note that because the fort is red - detuned , @xmath16 ) .",
    "in the limit that the fort is far - detuned ( @xmath17 ) , we can adiabatically eliminate the excited state ( see @xcite ) to obtain an effective hamiltonian for the ground state : @xmath18 where @xmath19 describes a trapping potential with depth @xmath20 .",
    "for the experiments described in @xcite , the power in the fort beam is set such that @xmath21 . to describe the shape of the potential , it is convenient to use a cylindrical coordinate system centered on the cavity axis : we will let @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the axial and radial coordinates of the atom , where the cavity mirrors are located at @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "using equation ( [ eqn : mode - shape - general ] ) to substitute for the mode shape @xmath12 in this coordinate system , we find that @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the wavenumber for the fort mode @xmath6 .",
    "the minima of the potential occur at the points @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is defined such that @xmath31 since @xmath32 , we find that @xmath33 ; thus , there are @xmath6 distinct fort wells in which an atom can be trapped .",
    "let us assume that the atom is trapped in fort well @xmath34 .",
    "it is convenient to define a coordinate @xmath35 that gives the axial displacement of the atom from the potential minimum of this well .",
    "we can then express the trapping potential as @xmath36 near the bottom of the well the potential can be approximated as harmonic , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the radial and axial vibrational frequencies , are given by @xmath40 the corresponding periods @xmath41 and @xmath42 characterize the timescales for radial and axial motion . for the experiments described in @xcite , the vibrational frequencies are @xmath43 and @xmath44 , so the timescale for radial motion is much longer than the timescale for axial motion .",
    "we will be interested in describing the evolution of system over timescales that are short compared to the timescale for radial motion , but not necessarily short compared to the timescale for axial motion .",
    "for such timescales we can view the atom as being radially stationary , and take @xmath23 to be a constant parameter that enters into the potential for the axial motion .",
    "thus , dropping a constant term , we can express the potential for the axial motion as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the axial trap depth at radial coordinate @xmath23 .",
    "to show how a raman coupling can be generated in a trapped atom , let us now consider a three - level model in which the atom has two ground states @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which correspond to the ground state hyperfine manifolds of a multi - level atom , and a single excited state @xmath2 .",
    "the excited state has energy @xmath3 , and the ground states @xmath47 and @xmath48 have energies @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the ground state hyperfine splitting . the hamiltonian for the atom is @xmath52 where @xmath53    we can generate a raman coupling between the two ground states by driving one of the cavity modes with a pair of beams that are tuned into raman resonance with the ground state hyperfine splitting of the atom .",
    "let us denote the optical frequencies of these beams by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the average frequency and @xmath56 is the frequency difference ( see figure [ fig : raman - config - levels ] ) .",
    "also , let us define a parameter @xmath57 that gives the raman detuning of the beams ; we will assume that the beams are tuned close to raman resonance , so @xmath58 .",
    "the beams generate standing - wave fields inside the cavity , and the coupling of the atom to these fields is described by the hamiltonian @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is an atomic lowering operator . here @xmath11 is the position of the atom , @xmath62 is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the shape of the driven mode ( see appendix [ sec : cavity - mode - structure ] ) , and @xmath63 are the rabi frequencies of the fields at a point of maximum intensity . for simplicity , we have assumed that the @xmath64 and @xmath65 transitions couple to the light fields with equal strength .",
    "the total hamiltonian for the system is @xmath66 .",
    "we can simplify this hamiltonian by making the rotating wave approximation and then performing a unitary transformation : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 describes the overall detuning of the optical fields from the excited state .",
    "we will assume that the fields are far - detuned from the atom ( @xmath70 ) , so we can further simplify the hamiltonian by adiabatically eliminating the excited state to obtain an effective hamiltonian for the ground states : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 we will assume that the optical fields are weak enough that @xmath74 , so the first term of @xmath75 dominates and to a good approximation the eigenstates of @xmath75 are @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the second term of @xmath75 describes a state - independent level shift , which is analogous to the fort potential we derived in the previous section .",
    "the third term of @xmath75 gives a state - dependent correction to the level shift , which is of order @xmath78 and may therefore be neglected .",
    "the fourth term of @xmath75 describes a modulation of the state - independent level shift at frequency @xmath56 . because we have assumed that the system is tuned near to raman resonance , @xmath56 is of the same order as the hyperfine splitting @xmath51 . for cesium ,",
    "the atom used in the experiments described in @xcite , the hyperfine splitting is @xmath79 , which is much larger than the harmonic frequencies @xmath38 and @xmath39 that characterize the timescales for atomic motion .",
    "thus , over the motional timescales the fourth term of @xmath75 averages to zero and may also be neglected . after making these approximations ,",
    "we are left with @xmath80 we can further simplify the effective hamiltonian by making the rotating wave approximation and then performing a unitary transformation to eliminate the time - dependence : @xmath81 this hamiltonian describes an effective two - level atom with ground state @xmath47 and excited state @xmath48 , which is driven by a classical field with rabi frequency @xmath82 and detuning @xmath83 .",
    "we will now use this effective hamiltonian to describe two schemes for driving raman transitions in a trapped atom .     and @xmath48 , the excited state @xmath2 , and the pair of optical fields at frequencies @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "]      in the first scheme , which we will call the fort - raman configuration , the fort itself forms one leg of a raman pair . to form the other leg of the pair we add a much weaker beam , which we will call the raman beam , that drives the same cavity mode as the fort but is detuned from the cavity resonance by @xmath56 .",
    "this configuration was first proposed in @xcite , and formed the basis of the optical pumping scheme described in @xcite and of the cooling scheme used in @xcite to extend the lifetime of a trapped atom .",
    "let us denote the optical frequencies of the fort and raman beams by @xmath5 and @xmath86 , and their maximum rabi frequencies inside the cavity by @xmath13 and @xmath87 .",
    "we can then apply the results of section [ ssec : raman - three - level - effective - hamiltonian ] to obtain an effective hamiltonian @xmath75 that describes the fort - raman pair .",
    "we will assume that the raman beam is blue - detuned from the fort ( @xmath88 ) , so we take the @xmath89 field to be the raman field and the @xmath90 field to be the fort field ; if the raman beam is red - detuned from the fort ( @xmath91 ) then we reverse these identifications .",
    "as was discussed in section [ sec : trapping ] , we treat the atom as being radially stationary , and consider only the axial motion .",
    "thus , the total hamiltonian for the atom is given by @xmath92 here @xmath93 is the momentum of the atom in the axial direction , and @xmath75 is given by equation ( [ eqn : effective - hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the maximum level shifts due to the fort and raman fields individually , and @xmath98 is the overall detuning of the fort and raman beams from the atom .",
    "it is convenient to express @xmath99 as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 describes the axial motion of the atom , and @xmath102 describes the internal state of the atom .",
    "typically the powers of the fort and raman beams are such that @xmath103 and @xmath21 , and for these values @xmath104 .",
    "thus , we can neglect the level shift of the raman beams and approximate @xmath105 as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the fort trapping potential . as in section",
    "[ sec : trapping ] , we will assume that the atom is trapped in fort well @xmath34 , and define a coordinate @xmath35 that gives the axial displacement of the atom from the well minimum . note that @xmath108 where we have substituted for the fort mode shape @xmath12 using equation ( [ eqn : mode - shape - general ] ) and for @xmath109 using equation ( [ eqn : fort - well - locations ] ) .",
    "thus , we can express the internal hamiltonian as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the effective rabi frequency for an atom at radial coordinate @xmath23 .",
    "for the second configuration , which we will call the raman - raman configuration , the fort drives mode @xmath6 of the cavity at frequency @xmath5 , and a pair of raman beams drives mode @xmath112 of the cavity at frequency @xmath113 .",
    "this configuration was used to perform the ground - state cooling described in @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the raman beams have equal powers and are tuned symmetrically about the cavity resonance , so the frequencies of these beams can be expressed as @xmath114 .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the maximum rabi frequency for the fort beam , and let @xmath87 denote the maximum rabi frequency for one of the raman beams . using the results of section [ ssec : raman - three - level - effective - hamiltonian ]",
    ", we can describe the coupling of the atom to the pair of raman fields in terms of an effective hamiltonian @xmath75 .    as was discussed in section [ sec : trapping ] , we treat the atom as being radially stationary , and consider only the axial motion .",
    "thus , the total hamiltonian for the system is @xmath115 the first term describes the kinetic energy of the atom due to axial motion , and the second term describes the fort potential @xmath107 , where @xmath96 is the fort depth .",
    "the third term is given by equation ( [ eqn : effective - hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the overall detuning of the raman pair from the atom .",
    "it is convenient to express @xmath99 as @xmath100 , where @xmath120 describes the motion of the atom , and @xmath121 describes the internal state of the atom .",
    "note that because the fort and raman beams drive different cavity modes , the registration of the standing waves corresponding to the two beams depends on the axial position of the atom , and therefore on the particular fort well in which the atom is trapped .",
    "this is in contrast to the fort - raman configuration , for which the fort and raman standing waves are always perfectly registered .",
    "one consequence of the well - dependence of the registration is that the level shift @xmath122 due to the raman pair distorts different fort wells in different ways .",
    "we calculate this effect in appendix [ sec : potential - distortion ] , but for now we note that for the typical parameters @xmath103 , @xmath21 the ratio of the level shifts due to the fort and raman beams is @xmath123 .",
    "thus @xmath124 , so we can neglect the @xmath122 term and approximate @xmath105 as @xmath125 as in section [ sec : trapping ] , we will assume that the atom is trapped in fort well @xmath34 , and define a coordinate @xmath35 that gives the axial displacement of the atom from the well minimum .",
    "note that @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the phase difference between the fort and raman beams at the bottom of fort well @xmath34 .",
    "here we have substituted for the fort mode shape @xmath12 using equation ( [ eqn : mode - shape - general ] ) and for @xmath109 using equation ( [ eqn : fort - well - locations ] ) .",
    "we will assume that the fort and raman beams drive nearby modes of the cavity , so @xmath128 .",
    "in this limit @xmath129 and @xmath130 , so we can approximate equation ( [ eqn : raman - intensity - profile ] ) as @xmath131 thus , we can express the internal hamiltonian as @xmath132 where @xmath111 is the effective rabi frequency for an atom at radial coordinate @xmath23 .",
    "we have shown that that for both the fort - raman and the raman - raman configurations the hamiltonian has the form @xmath100 , where @xmath133 for the fort - raman configuration @xmath134 , and for the raman - raman configuration @xmath127 for an atom trapped in fort well @xmath34 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath105 describes the motion of the atom in the axial potential and is independent of the atomic state , and the hamiltonian @xmath135 describes a raman coupling between the ground states that depends on the axial position of the atom .    for either the fort - raman or the raman - raman configuration , the raman coupling described by @xmath135 can be turned off by turning off one of the beams in the raman pair ( note that for fort - raman configuration the fort beam must always be on in order to maintain the trapping potential , so for this configuration one must turn off the raman beam ) .",
    "alternatively , one can keep the beams in the raman pair on at all times and turn off the raman coupling by tuning the pair out of raman resonance ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "as we have seen , there is a small level shift due to the raman beams , which we neglected when writing down the above expression for @xmath105 , and this detuning - based method has the advantage that these level shifts are always present regardless of whether the raman coupling is on or off . with the first method",
    ", these level shifts cause a slight change in the trapping potential whenever the raman coupling is turned on or off , which could potentially heat the atom or cause other problems .",
    "for many applications , such as raman sideband cooling , it is necessary to quantize the axial motion ; that is , to treat the axial position @xmath137 and momentum @xmath93 as quantum operators .",
    "we first show how this is achieved for cold atoms , and then discuss some numerical results that apply to atoms of arbitrary temperature .      for cold atoms",
    "the axial trapping potential is nearly harmonic , where the harmonic frequency @xmath138 is given by @xmath139 we can quantize the axial motion by introducing phonon creation and annihilation operators operators @xmath140 and @xmath48 , which are related to @xmath137 and @xmath93 by @xmath141 from these relations , we find that @xmath142 where @xmath143 , the lamb - dicke parameter , is given by @xmath144 .",
    "note that because @xmath138 depends on the radial coordinate @xmath23 , the lamb - dicke parameter also depends on @xmath23 .",
    "if the atoms are sufficiently cold , we can obtain a reasonable approximation to @xmath145 by expanding in @xmath143 and retaining terms only up to second order ; from equations ( [ eqn : h - ext ] ) , ( [ eqn : h - int ] ) , and ( [ eqn : kf - x ] ) , we find that @xmath146 it is convenient to form a basis of states @xmath147 for the system by taking tensor products of the internal states @xmath76 and @xmath77 with the motional fock states @xmath148 . to order @xmath149 these product states are eigenstates of @xmath105 , where pairs of states @xmath150 , @xmath151 with the same vibrational quantum number @xmath152 are degenerate and have energy @xmath153 the raman coupling described by @xmath135 drives transitions between the product states . by taking matrix elements of the raman coupling , we find that state @xmath150 is coupled to states @xmath151 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 , where the rabi frequencies for these transitions are given by @xmath156 note that @xmath157 transitions are suppressed relative to @xmath158 transitions by @xmath159 , and @xmath160 transitions are suppressed relative to @xmath158 transitions by @xmath161 . to resonantly drive the @xmath162 transition we set @xmath163 , and to resonantly drive the @xmath164 and @xmath165 transitions we set @xmath166 and @xmath167 , where @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "for a harmonic trap @xmath170 and the frequencies of these transitions are independent of @xmath152 , but because the fort is shallower than its harmonic approximation , @xmath171 decreases with increasing @xmath152 .    recall that for the fort - raman configuration @xmath172 , whereas for the raman - raman configuration the value of @xmath173 depends on the fort well in which the atom is trapped .",
    "thus , in the fort - raman configuration the rabi frequencies are the same for all the fort wells , whereas in the raman - raman configuration the rabi frequencies vary from well to well .",
    "also , note that in the fort - raman configuration the @xmath157 transitions are always forbidden .",
    "this follows from symmetry considerations : since the trapping potential is symmetric under @xmath174 the motional eigenstates are also parity eigenstates , and since the raman coupling is symmetric under @xmath174 it can not couple an even parity state to an odd parity state .",
    "the harmonic approximation we described in the previous section only applies to fock states @xmath175 for which @xmath176 . for higher - lying energy levels",

    "following the same reasoning that was used in sections [ sec : raman - raman - three - level ] and [ sec : fort - raman - three - level ] , we can use the effective hamiltonian given in equation ( [ eqn : effective - hamiltonian - cesium ] ) to write down the total hamiltonian @xmath99 for the fort - raman and raman - raman configurations . in both cases the total hamiltonian has the form @xmath100 , where @xmath241 here @xmath242 and @xmath243 are the axial trap depth and the effective rabi frequency at radial coordinate @xmath23 , and the parameters @xmath244 and @xmath240 are calculated for the fort - raman and raman - raman configurations in the following sections [ sec : fort - raman - cesium ] and [ sec : raman - raman - cesium ] .      as was discussed in section [ sec : fort - raman - three - level ] , in the fort - raman configuration the fort forms one leg of the raman pair , and a weak raman beam is added to form the second leg .",
    "the fort resonantly drives mode @xmath6 of the cavity , and the raman beam drives the same mode as the fort but is detuned from the cavity resonance by @xmath245 .",
    "we can obtain expressions for the fort depth @xmath244 and the effective rabi frequency @xmath240 by using equations ( [ eqn : v - eff - cesium ] ) and ( [ eqn : omega - eff - cesium ] ) , which relate these quantities to the maximum intensities of the fort and raman beams inside the cavity , together with equation ( [ eqn : intracavity - intensity ] ) from appendix [ sec : cavity - mode - structure ] , which relates these maximum intensities to the optical powers of the fort and raman beams at the input of the cavity ( note that because the raman beam is detuned from the cavity resonance , its coupling into the cavity is suppressed ) .",
    "we find that @xmath246 here @xmath247 and @xmath248 are the powers of the fort and raman beams at the input of the cavity , @xmath249 is a reference power that is set by the cavity geometry and is defined in equation ( [ eqn : power - c ] ) of appendix [ sec : cavity - mode - structure ] , @xmath250 is the total energy decay rate for the fort mode @xmath6 , and @xmath251 and @xmath252 , the detuning parameters at the fort wavelength @xmath253 , are given by equation ( [ eqn : detuning - parameters ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that for fixed powers in the fort and raman beams , the effective rabi frequency @xmath240 monotonically increases as the cavity decay rate @xmath250 is reduced .    in deriving the expression for @xmath244 given in equation ( [ eqn : fort - depth ] )",
    ", we assumed that the detuning of the fort from the cesium @xmath230 and @xmath231 lines was the same for the @xmath196 and @xmath197 ground state hyperfine manifolds .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation , because these detunings are much larger than the hyperfine splitting @xmath51 .",
    "however , because the detuning of the @xmath196 manifold is slightly larger than the detuning of the @xmath197 manifold , the fort potential is slightly weaker for @xmath196",
    ". thus , the fort squeezes the two manifolds together , causing a small reduction in the effective hyperfine splitting .",
    "this effect , which is calculated in appendix [ sec : differential - stark ] , gives a slight position - dependence to the effective raman detuning , but this can be neglected for many applications .",
    "as was discussed in section [ sec : raman - raman - three - level ] , in the raman - raman configuration the fort resonantly drives mode @xmath6 of the cavity , and pair of raman beams drives mode @xmath112 of the cavity .",
    "we will assume that the two raman beams have equal powers @xmath248 and are tuned symmetrically about the cavity resonance .",
    "the fort depth @xmath244 is given by equation ( [ eqn : fort - depth ] ) , and we can obtain an expression for the rabi frequency @xmath240 by using equation ( [ eqn : omega - eff - cesium ] ) , which relates the rabi frequency to the maximum intensities of the raman beams inside the cavity , together with equation ( [ eqn : intracavity - intensity ] ) from appendix [ sec : cavity - mode - structure ] , which relates these maximum intensities to the optical powers of the raman beams at the input of the cavity ( note that because the raman beams are detuned from the cavity resonance , their coupling into the cavity is suppressed ) .",

    "note that for fixed powers in the raman beams there is an optimal cavity decay rate @xmath259 that maximizes the effective rabi frequency @xmath240 .      the operator @xmath239 that appears in @xmath135 couples individual zeeman transitions between the @xmath196 and @xmath197 ground state hyperfine manifolds . in this section",
    ", we calculate the matrix elements for these transitions .",
    "let us introduce an arbitrary coordinate system @xmath260 and define a set of zeeman states @xmath261 relative to this coordinate system .",
    "we can express the unit vector @xmath211 that lies along the cavity axis as @xmath262 where @xmath263 is the angle between the cavity axis @xmath211 and the quantization axis @xmath264 .",
    "note that @xmath265 where @xmath266 are angular momentum raising and lowering operators .",
    "thus , the state @xmath267 couples to states @xmath268 and @xmath269 , and the matrix elements corresponding to these transitions are @xmath270 where we have used that the matrix elements of @xmath271 are given by @xcite @xmath272 note that if the quantization axis is aligned along the cavity axis then @xmath273 transitions are forbidden , and if the quantization axis is transverse to the cavity axis then @xmath274 transitions are forbidden .",
    "we have shown that the raman coupling can drive transitions that raise or lower the axial vibrational quantum number @xmath152 . in this section ,",
    "we show how one can exploit these @xmath152-changing transitions to cool the axial motion to the vibrational ground state .",
    "we will first show how the cooling works using the three - level model , and then discuss cooling for a physically realistic cesium atom .",
    "one way to cool the atom is to alternate coherent raman pulses tuned to an @xmath152-lowering transition with incoherent repumping pulses . to see how this works ,",
    "let us assume that we start out with the atom in state @xmath150 .",
    "we can lower the vibrational quantum number by driving the atom with a coherent raman pulse tuned to the @xmath275 transition , which transfers some of the population from @xmath150 to @xmath276 .",
    "the atom can then be repumped to ground state @xmath47 by driving the @xmath65 transition with near - resonant light . the repumping light drives the atom to the excited state , from which it spontaneously decays to either ground state @xmath48 , where it continues to interact with the repumping light , or to ground state @xmath47 , where it is dark to the light .",
    "if the atom is sufficiently cold to begin with , then the repumping process is unlikely to change the atom s vibrational state , because the matrix elements for @xmath152-changing transitions are suppressed relative to the matrix elements for @xmath152-preserving transitions by at least @xmath277 , where @xmath278 .",
    "thus , the net effect of the raman and repumping pulses is to move some of the population from state @xmath150 to state @xmath279 . by iterating the pulse sequence ,",
    "the atom can be cooled to a state that has a mean vibrational quantum number @xmath280 that is close to zero .",
    "the same type of scheme can be used to cool a multi - level alkali atom . for a cesium atom ,",
    "the @xmath196 ground state manifold plays the role of state @xmath47 and the @xmath197 ground state manifold plays the role of state @xmath48 : we start with the atom in a random zeeman state in @xmath196 , drive the atom with a coherent raman pulse tuned to the @xmath281 transition , and then repump the atom to @xmath196 .",
    "it is easiest to understand the effects of these pulses if we choose the quantization axis to lie along the cavity axis , so that only @xmath274 transitions are allowed and the raman coupling drives transitions between pairs of states @xmath282 .",
    "if the ambient magnetic fields are nulled , then these zeeman transitions are all degenerate , so the transition frequency of the @xmath281 transition is independent of @xmath283 .",
    "thus , the coherent raman pulse is effective at lowering the vibrational quantum number regardless of which zeeman state in @xmath196 the atom started in : each zeeman pair behaves equivalently , except for a slight @xmath283-dependence in the rabi frequency that is given by equation ( [ eqn : zeeman - zero ] ) .",
    "the zeeman state of the atom is then scrambled during the repumping phase , so at the beginning of the next cooling cycle the atom starts out in a potentially new zeeman state .    the amount of time it takes to cool the atom is determined by the amount of time it takes to repump the atom , which is set by the spontaneous decay rate of the excited state , and by the amount of time it takes to perform the coherent raman pulse , which is set by the rabi frequency @xmath284 .",
    "the cooling rate can be increased by increasing the rabi frequency , but as we increase the rabi frequency we begin to off - resonantly drive the @xmath162 transition , and this sets an upper limit to the rabi frequency that can be used .",
    "off - resonant driving of the @xmath285 transition becomes important when @xmath286 , so the upper limit to the rabi frequency is given by @xmath287 .",
    "there is also a lower limit to the value of @xmath280 that can be achieved with this cooling scheme , which is set by two different factors .",
    "first , when we resonantly drive the @xmath288 transition with the coherent raman pulse , we can also off - resonantly drive the @xmath289 transition .",
    "this mechanism gives a lower limit of @xmath290 .",
    "we can reduce this limit by reducing the rabi frequency , but since the rabi frequency determines the cooling rate , this also slows down the cooling .",
    "in addition , there are problems with using small rabi frequencies that are due to the anharmonicity of the fort , which will be discussed later .",
    "ideally , one would gradually reduce the rabi frequency as the atom cools , so as to balance the conflicting demands for a high cooling rate and a low value of @xmath280 . a second factor that limits @xmath280",
    "is the fact that when the atom is repumped it will not always remain in the same vibrational state it started out in , since the lamb - dicke suppression of @xmath152-changing transitions is not perfect .",
    "this mechanism gives a lower limit of @xmath291 .",
    "the cooling scheme described above can be modified in several ways .",
    "first , rather than alternating raman pulses with repumping pulses , it is also possible to continuously drive the atom with both raman and repumping light , and this is the method that was used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "second , the cooling scheme we described relies on @xmath292 transitions , but it is also possible to cool the atom using @xmath293 transitions . indeed , for the fort - raman configuration the @xmath292 transitions are forbidden , so the atom can only be cooled using @xmath293 transitions .",
    "cooling via @xmath293 transitions tends to be slower than cooling via @xmath292 transitions , since the condition @xmath286 gives an upper limit on the rabi frequency of @xmath294 . also , for @xmath293 transitions",
    "both the state @xmath295 and the state @xmath296 decouple from the raman pulse , so the state to which the system cools depends on the initial state : if we start in a state @xmath150 with @xmath152 even then the system cools to @xmath295 , and if we start in state @xmath150 with @xmath152 odd then the system cools to @xmath296 .",
    "note that because the fort is anharmonic , the resonant frequency of the @xmath292 and @xmath293 transitions depends on the value of @xmath152 .",
    "this means that if we keep the raman detuning @xmath83 set at at a fixed value throughout the cooling process , then the detuning of the raman pulse from the atom will change as the atom cools .",
    "we can estimate the importance of this effect by considering @xmath292 and @xmath293 transitions as separate cases .",
    "first we will consider @xmath292 transitions .",
    "let us assume that we set the raman detuning to @xmath297 , so the detuning of the raman pulse from the @xmath275 transition is @xmath298 as we have shown , the maximum rabi frequency that can be used is @xmath299 , and for this maximum value the ratio of the detuning to the rabi frequency is @xmath300 , which is small for cold atoms .",
    "thus , for @xmath292 transitions the dependence of the detuning on @xmath152 is a small effect ; we can simply set the raman detuning to @xmath301 , and as long as the atoms start out reasonably cold the cooling will always be efficient .    now consider @xmath293 transitions .",
    "we will assume that the raman detuning is set to @xmath302 , so the detuning of the raman pulse from the @xmath303 transition is @xmath304 as we have shown , the maximum rabi frequency that can be used is @xmath294 , and for this maximum value the ratio of the detuning to the rabi frequency is @xmath305 .",
    "thus , for @xmath293 transitions the dependence of the detuning on @xmath152 is a significant effect . to compensate for this problem , one could slowly decrease the raman detuning @xmath83 during the cooling process to ensure that the raman pulse remains in resonance as the atom cools .",
    "although we have focused on cooling the axial motion of the atom , it is possible to implement the axial cooling schemes in such a way that they cool the atom s radial motion as well .",
    "this is accomplished by configuring the repumping light so that it provides polarization gradient cooling @xcite in the plane transverse to the cavity axis .",
    "specifically , the repumping light is tuned blue of the @xmath306 transition , and is delivered to the atom via two pairs of counter - propagating beams .",
    "the two pairs of beams are perpendicular to one another and to the cavity axis , and therefore provide cooling in both transverse directions .",
    "one can characterize the effectiveness of the cooling schemes described in the previous section by using raman spectroscopy to measure the temperature of the atom . in what follows",
    ", we will assume that @xmath292 transitions are used to cool the atom , although the same methods can also be applied to cooling via @xmath293 transitions .    to measure a raman spectrum ,",
    "we cool the atom , pump it into ground state @xmath47 , and then drive it with a coherent raman pulse with detuning @xmath83 .",
    "we then check if the atom was transfered to @xmath48 . by iterating this sequence",
    "one can measure the probability that the atom is transfered from @xmath47 to @xmath48 by the raman pulse , and by repeating this measurement for raman pulses of different detunings one can map out a raman spectrum . for an atom in vibrational state @xmath152 , the raman spectrum will exhibit a peak at @xmath163 , which corresponds to @xmath285 transitions , and peaks at @xmath307 , which correspond to @xmath164 transitions .",
    "we will refer to the peak at @xmath163 as the carrier , and the peaks at @xmath308 and @xmath309 as the red and blue sidebands . because of the fort anharmonicity @xmath171 depends on @xmath152 , but we will assume that the atoms are cold enough that this effect can be neglected and simply take @xmath310 .    one way to determine the axial temperature of the atom is to measure the ratio of the red to the blue sideband ; this is the same technique as was used in @xcite to determine the temperature of a trapped ion . for a thermal distribution ,",
    "the probability that the atom has axial vibrational quantum number @xmath152 is given by @xmath311 where @xmath312 is the mean vibrational quantum number .",
    "if we start with the atom in state @xmath47 and resonantly drive the blue sideband with a raman pulse of duration @xmath313 , the probability that the atom is transfered to state @xmath48 is given by @xmath314 if we start in state @xmath47 and resonantly drive the red sideband , the probability that the atom is transfered to state @xmath48 is given by @xmath315 note that @xmath316 so the ratio of the transfer probabilities for the red and blue sidebands is @xmath317    an alternative way to quantify the cooling is to measure the population in the vibrational ground state .",
    "this can be accomplished by pumping the atom to state @xmath47 and applying a raman pulse whose detuning is adiabatically swept across the red sideband . if the atom started in the vibrational ground state @xmath318 then it will remain in state @xmath47 , and if the atom started in a vibrational state @xmath319 then the raman pulse will adiabatically transfer it to state @xmath48 . thus , the population in the vibrational ground state is given by the probability that the atom remains in state @xmath47 after the adiabatic sweep has been completed .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it does not rely on assuming that the atoms are thermally distributed .",
    "it is also possible to use raman spectroscopy to say something about the radial temperature : since the axial frequency @xmath320 depends on the radial coordinate @xmath23 , the width of the sidebands depends on the radial temperature .",
    "the probability that the atom has axial frequency @xmath321 is given by @xmath322 where @xmath323 is the potential for radial motion , and @xmath324 if the radial temperature is small compared to the trap depth ( @xmath325 ) , then we can make a harmonic approximation and perform the integral analytically : @xmath326 thus , if the blue sideband has width @xmath327 , one can put an upper limit on the radial temperature of @xmath328 .",
    "the cooling schemes discussed in section [ ssec : cooling - schemes ] can be simulated on a computer .",

    "this research is supported by the national science foundation , the army research office , and the disruptive technology office of the department of national intelligence .",
    "here we describe the mode structure of the optical cavity .",
    "the cavity we will be considering consists of two symmetric mirrors of radius @xmath352 that are separated by a distance @xmath0 . it is convenient to define a cylindrical coordinate system that is centered on the cavity axis : we will denote the distance from the cavity axis by @xmath23 and the displacement along the cavity axis by @xmath22 , where the mirrors are located at @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the cavity supports a set of discrete modes with resonant frequencies at integer multiples of the free spectral range @xmath8 , where for each frequency there are two degenerate modes corresponding to the two polarization states transverse to the cavity axis .",
    "consider one of the polarization modes with mode order @xmath152 .",
    "we will let @xmath353 denote the resonant frequency of the mode , and let @xmath354 and @xmath355 denote the corresponding wavelength and wavenumber .",
