    "dna is not the static double helix that structural pictures show . at biological temperature",
    "its thermal fluctuations are very large , leading to temporary openings of the base pairs , and when temperature is increased up to @xmath0 or @xmath1c , depending on the sequence , the two strands separate in a transition often called `` dna melting '' @xcite .",
    "these phenomena have been the object of many experimental and theoretical studies in the last few decades but there are still open questions .",
    "one of them is the understanding of the role of the base - pair sequence .",
    "there are many aspects in this problem , depending on the scale at which it is observed , i.e.  the length of the dna molecule which is considered .",
    "most of the earlier studies investigated natural dna molecules , with thousands or hundreds of thousands of base pairs @xcite .",
    "recording the melting curves of such dna samples , for instance through the variation of the uv absorbance of a solution , analyzes the phenomena with a resolution of hundreds of base pairs or more .",
    "single molecule experiments observing the mechanical denaturation of a long dna segment @xcite , which is thermally assisted , find a good correlation between the richness of the sequence in gc base pairs , harder to break than at pairs , and the force necessary to open the molecule , but the resolution is again of the order of 100 base pairs .",
    "thus all these studies are not able to analyze sequence effects at the scale of a few base pairs , which is the relevant scale for the genetic code .    on another hand",
    "it is now possible to perform a systematic study of the fluctuations and melting of short dna sequences ( typically 20 to 60 base pairs ) , which can be specifically designed to study a particular effect and synthesized .",
    "this allows new experimental studies , which , in turn raise interesting theoretical questions .",
    "this is the object of the present paper .",
    "section [ sec : experiments ] presents experimental results .",
    "some of them have been obtained by other authors but they are briefly reviewed here because they provide interesting test results for the theoretical analysis presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] .",
    "others are new and demonstrate that the large fluctuations of at - rich regions of dna are affecting the properties of the molecule several base pairs away .",
    "this result must be taken into account to satisfactorily describe the melting of some dna sequences with a mesoscopic model , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] .",
    "the study of some sequences which pose a particular challenge to the theories of dna melting confirms the need to include the non - local effects of the at - rich segments of dna to properly model the thermal denaturation .",
    "this gives a second indication that the influence of highly fluctuating regions of dna on their neighborhood can extend to some distance .",
    "the famous double - helix structure of dna is made of two strands that carry organic bases that are bound in pairs by hydrogen bonds , keeping the two strands together .",
    "there are 4 types of bases , called a , t , g , c , but only at and gc pairs are part of the structure of dna .",
    "the at pairs are bound by two hydrogen bonds , while the stronger gc pairs are bound by three hydrogen bonds .",
    "the covalent bonds that bind the atoms in the backbones and inside the bases are very strong whereas the hydrogen bonds that connect the two bases in a pair are much weaker .",
    "they can be broken by thermal fluctuations at biological temperature , exposing the bases to the surrounding solvent before the base pair closes again .",
    "these large fluctuations which are called the `` breathing of dna '' are well known by biologists .",
    "early studies of these fluctuations relied on deuterium - proton exchange .",
    "if dna is dissolved into deuterated water , when the opening of a base pair exposes to the solvent the protons that form the hydrogen bonds , the so - called imino protons , those protons can be exchanged with deuterium from the water molecules of the solvent .",
    "the exchange rate can be accelerated by a catalyst .",
    "then nmr can be used to detect the deuterium atoms within the dna molecule @xcite .",
    "kinetic experiments show that the lifetime of base pairs ( time during which they stay closed ) is in the range of milliseconds at @xmath2c and 10 times more at @xmath3c . at biological temperatures",
    "the experiments show that _ single base pair opening events are the only mode of base pair disruption .",
    "_ this indicates that the large amplitude conformational change that is able to break a pair and expose a base to the solvent is a _ highly localized phenomenon_. the lifetime of the open state , estimated from kinetics data , is of a few tens of nanoseconds @xcite . at higher temperatures the picture changes .",
    "thermal fluctuations can break the base pairs in large regions of dna , leading to the so - called `` dna bubbles '' , which grow when temperature is raised , until the full separation of the strands .",
    "this _ melting transition _ of dna is very sharp for homogeneous sequences .",
    "it can be easily studied because the absorption of uv light at @xmath4 nm increases drastically when the base pairs are unstacked .",
    "the melting transition shows up therefore as a sharp rise of the uv absorption of the dna solution , which only occurs within a few degrees for a short dna homopolymer .    for heteropolymers , such as dna with a natural base sequence ,",
    "the melting profile is different because at - rich regions tend to melt at lower temperature than the gc - rich regions .",
    "this leads to melting curves which are very sensitive to the details of the sequence , and not yet fully understood although some empirical models can give rather accurate predictions , at a resolution of a few hundreds of base pairs for long sequences @xcite . for long molecules the thermal separation of the two strands",
    "is probably well described by a zipper mechanism .",
    "this is different for short dna sequences of less than 100 base pairs .",
    "very short oligomers melt in a two - state process in which they are either fully closed as double helices or fully separated in individual strands .",
    "longer molecules can exist in intermediate states in which a part of the molecule is open and the other part is closed .",
    "for instance they can have either open ends or open `` bubbles '' in the middle .",
    "this raises a question to experimentalists .",
    "measuring the uv absorbance gives the fraction @xmath5 of open base pairs , but should a fraction of say @xmath6 be interpreted as meaning that 50% of the molecules are fully closed and the other 50% fully open , or does it means that all the molecules are in an intermediate state where half of their base pairs are open .",
    "this question can only be answered by also determining the fraction @xmath7 of fully open molecules .    using a clever trick , made possible by the availability of artificial dna sequences that can be tailored for a particular purpose , montrichok et al .",
    "@xcite managed to do such a measurement .",
    "the idea is to use sequences which are partly self - complementary .",
    "each strand is such that a set of bases at one end are complementary of the bases pairs at the other end . as a result , when it is free , such a strand tends to fold into a hairpin , the two ends forming a short dna double helix closed by a loop made by the central section of the strand , which does not include self - complementary sequences .",
    "when a solution containing double helices made of such strands is heated until a complete melting of all the molecules , and then cooled down , the strands can either form hairpins or get together in pairs to reform the double helix .",
    "but the formation of the hairpins from single strands is much faster because two strands do not have to find each other by diffusing in the solution .",
    "the experimental process used by montricok et al .",
    "is the following .",
    "they slowly heat a solution of the dna under study and record its uv absorbance that gives @xmath5 versus temperature . at selected temperatures",
    "they take an aliquot and cool it down quickly .",
    "all molecules which are fully melted lead to the formation of hairpins while those which are only partly open reclose as double helices .",
    "this allows them to determine @xmath7 at these selected temperatures .",
    "this study @xcite provides an interesting set of experimental results on dna melting because , from the data , it is possible to extract the average length of the denaturation bubbles as a function of temperature and the statistical weight of bubble states . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , owing to peculiar properties of some of the investigated sequences , these experiments raise very challenging questions for the theoretical analysis of dna melting .",
    "proton - deuterium exchange measurements , and melting studies measuring @xmath5 and @xmath7 provide a good set of experimental data of dna fluctuations and melting , but they lack an essential piece of information , the spatial information that says precisely where the fluctuations occur .",
    "this is why we performed a set of experiments , using an original method , that can provide a mapping of the strength of the fluctuations of the double helix as a function of the position of along the sequence .",
    "this adds a new dimension to the melting curves .    usually extracting local information on dna fluctuations",
    "relies on a dye or fluorophore probe inserted in a special molecular construct , which reports on the properties of dna in its vicinity @xcite .",
    "this method has two major drawbacks .",
    "first it provides information on a single point in the sequence , the place where the probe is located .",
    "second the probe is probably not innocuous and it can perturb the dynamics of dna in its vicinity .",
    "_ our method asks dna itself to report on its internal state .",
    "_ it uses the propensity of the guanine bases g to be ionized by biphotonic excitation from a strong uv laser pulse .",
    "two guanine modifications , oxazolone and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2-oxoguanine ( 8-oxodg ) have been identified as the major one - electron oxidative dna lesions .",
    "their formation depends on the local dna conformation and charge - transfer efficiency @xcite which is affected by local fluctuations .",
    "while oxazolone is the unique product resulting from one - electron oxidation of the free @xmath8-deoxyguanosine , 8-oxodg appears as soon as the nucleoside is incorporated in a helical structure .",
    "hence the measurement of the relative yield of these photoproducts at each g site tells us whether this g was in an helical structure ( closed ) or whether it was open when the molecule was hit by the laser pulse .",
    "therefore it gives a snapshot of the opening of dna at each g site . as the experiment is not performed on a single molecule but in solution the results",
    "are obtained on a statistical ensemble and they give the opening probability at each g site at the temperature of the study .    to measure the relative yield of the production of oxazolone and 8-oxodg we can rely on standard biological methods .",
    "piperidine cleaves dna at the sites where it has oxazolone , i.e. where the guanine was unstacked ( open base pair ) , whereas fpg protein cleaves it as sites which have 8-oxodg .",
    "one end of the molecule is marked by a radioactive marker , and , after cleavage by piperidine or fpg , performed on different aliquots at the same temperature , the lengths of the fragments that carry the marker are measured by gel electrophoresis .",
    "the labelled fragments of length @xmath9 are those which were cleaved at a guanine situated at distance @xmath9 from the marked end .",
    "the ratio @xmath10 of the number of radioactively labeled fragments of length @xmath9 produced by fpg cleavage or by piperidine cleavage indicates the probability of closing for this particular guanine . as the gel image contains the data for fragments of all lengths , a single experiment measures the opening probability at all guanine sites .    since our goal was to study sequence effects we performed these studies on two artificial sequences , specially designed to investigate the role of an at - rich region in dna .",
    "such at - rich regions , called tata boxes , exist in the transcription - initiation regions of the genes of various species .",
    "as the at base pairs bound by only two hydrogen bonds are weaker than the gc pairs , they are expected to exhibit large fluctuations even at biological temperature because they are closer to their melting temperature . depending on its length a poly - at dna melts around 55@xmath11c while a poly - gc melts around 80@xmath11c .",
    "figure [ fig : sequv ] shows two sequences that we investigated .",
    "sequence @xmath12 contains a tata box and two guanines , highlighted in the sequence , that were monitored as probes of the fluctuations of the dna molecule .",
    "probe @xmath13 is separated from the tata box by a buffer region which contains 7 bases , while probe @xmath14 is adjacent to the tata box , in the @xmath15 direction of the dna strand . in sequence @xmath16 probe @xmath17",
    "is surrounded by two small at - rich regions but the larger tata box and the guanine @xmath14 have been eliminated . in both cases",
    "these short dna molecules are terminated by gc rich domains which act as clamps to prevent large fluctuations of the free ends of the molecules , and hold the two strands together even when we heat the sample up to 60@xmath11c . in principle",
    "the guanines in these terminal parts could also be monitored in our analysis , but the spatial resolution near the end of the strands is not very good so that it is hard to separate two adjacent guanines in this region .",
    "this is why we have not studied them .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     .",
    "the probability that a given base pair is open at a particular temperature is shown as a function of the index of the base pair .",
    "indices are those listed in fig .",
    "[ fig : seq48 ] , the at - rich region starting at index 1.,width=340 ]    however the comparison with the experimental results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : montrichok48 ] shows that all theoretical approaches are _ qualitatively wrong ! _ it is important to stress that this is not a simple weakness of a particular model because all ising models , irrespectively of the parameter set that they use provided it is consistent with experiments for simple sequences , as well as our theoretical model which is very different , face the same problem .",
    "moreover the discrepancy between theory and experiment is not a small effect .",
    "the experiment finds that , although the opening occurs in two stages , the first stage extends well inside the gc rich region ( up to @xmath18 i.e.  base pair 36 ) .",
    "therefore , to understand this property one must look for a deep explanation rather than considering that it could be minor problem due , for instance , to incorrect parameters . this particular sequence , which seems to challenge all theoretical models is therefore particularly interesting .",
    "a solution to this challenge can be provided by the experiments that we presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiments ] .",
    "they indicate that an at - rich region , which fluctuates widely , is able to influence the opening of base pairs which are at least 8 base pair away in the sequence . in the case of the experiment on sequence @xmath19",
    "this effect could even be larger because the molecule opens at one end , so that the at - rich region can be expected to fluctuate even more than in our experiments , where it is clamped at both ends by one or several gc pairs .",
    "this suggests that , in the presence of a large at - rich region _ the model should include non - local effects to describe its influence on parts of the sequence which are not right next to it .",
    "_ in the experiments discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiments ] we noticed a lowering of the local melting temperature in the vicinity of an at - rich region , which is particularly strong right next to it and weaker further away . in the model",
    "this effect can be described phenomenologically by a local rescaling of the parameters .",
    "we know that the melting temperature decreases when the strength of the stacking interaction decreases @xcite .",
    "moreover the large fluctuations in an at - rich region can be expected to disrupt the stacking in the vicinity .",
    "this is why we decided to model the effect of an at - rich region by introducing a softening of the stacking interactions in the neighboring regions .",
    "we selected the following rules    * only at - rich regions which exceed a given size of @xmath20 consecutive at pairs are taken into account .",
    "* inside the at - rich domain , the parameters are not modified .",
    "* for all stacking interactions which are less than @xmath21 bonds from the at - rich region , the coupling constant @xmath22 is multiplied by a factor @xmath23 , * for all interactions which are @xmath24 bonds away from the at - rich region , @xmath25 , @xmath22 is multiplied by @xmath26 in order to reach smoothly the value 1 @xmath27 bonds away from the at - rich region .",
    "* for all stacking interactions which are at least @xmath27 bonds away from the at - rich region , the parameters of the interaction potential are not modified . * if a stacking bond is affected by more than one at - rich region , which could be the case for the stacking interactions which are between two at - rich domains , only the largest correction is considered .    from our experimental data on various sequences @xcite and from the theoretical studies of several cases , we set @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , but these parameters could certainly be refined by more extensive experimental studies .",

    "the derivative of the dsdna melting curve still shows a two - stage melting but , contrary to the first calculation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : montrichok48 ] ) , _ the first stage is now the dominant one , in agreement with experiments . _",
    "the three - dimensional melting curve indicates that , in the first stage , the melting that starts in the at - rich end of the molecule extends inside the gc region until approximately 75% of the molecule , and the last part opens then at higher temperature .",
    "the results are now in fairly good quantitative agreement with experiments , although the transition given by the model is still not as sharp as the experimental curve .",
    "this could certainly be improved by optimizing the parameters , but the one - dimensional model is affected by strong finite - size effects which tend to broaden the denaturation transitions for short sequences .",
    "nevertheless the results exhibit a qualitative change with respect to a calculation which only considered local properties of the molecule to determine the melting profile .",
    "this is an important point because this improvement can not be achieved by adjusting parameters while simultaneously preserving the correct melting temperatures of at or gc homopolymers .",
    "the sequence @xmath19 was particularly challenging .",
    "most of the other short sequences are much less sensitive to subtle non - local effects , and therefore less demanding on the model to reach a satisfactory agreement between theory and experiments .",
    "this is for instance the case for sequence @xmath33 of ref .",
    "@xcite which has 60 base pairs .",
    "it was designed with a 36 base pairs at - rich region in the middle , sandwiched by two gc rich domains .",
    "the at - rich center is however interrupted by a few gc pairs , the largest consecutive span of at base pairs containing only 8 pairs . according to our experiments",
    "@xcite a few isolated gc pairs scattered in an at domain are able to reduce significantly the fluctuations of this domain .",
    "this is certainly the case for sequence @xmath33 , which explains why the small gc rich domains at the ends of the sequence are sufficient to stabilize the molecule and prevent a full separation of the strands in spite of the large open domain .",
    "figure [ fig : open60 ] shows the melting profile given by the model , with the same parameters as for the sequence @xmath19 .",

    "the structure of the melting curve of dna molecules of a few tens of base pairs contains information at a scale which is relevant for the genetic code , and this why its analysis is very interesting .    in this work we showed that it is possible to add a spatial dimension to the melting curve through experiments that record the state of the guanines along the sequence",
    "this is still incomplete because only one type of bases can be monitored but it nevertheless brings useful data on the interplay between different parts of the molecule during the melting . in particular the results indicate that an at - rich region , which fluctuates widely even at moderate temperature , can affect the fluctuations of the double helix several base pairs away .",
    "this experimental result could be questioned because it is based on a measurement of the local fluctuations of the guanines which is not a direct observation , but involves complex transformations of the dna molecule , including electron transfers and further chemical reactions .",
    "but it is important to notice that a theoretical analysis of independent measurements converges to the same conclusion .    for this theoretical analysis we significantly modified the nonlinear model of dna that was introduced earlier .",
    "adding a barrier for closing to the intra - pair potential @xmath34 is essential to get correct time scales for the lifetime of the open states . as long as one computes statistical quantities such as the mean stretching of base pairs at a given temperature , it could seem irrelevant to care about dynamics .",
    "but this is however an important information which should not be neglected , and which is useful even for the calculation of static equilibrium properties because the model with a modified potential has different properties , such has a sharper melting transition .",
    "the second evolution of the model was to introduce the sequence in the stacking interactions because these ineractions depend even more drastically from the sequence than the intra - base potential .",
    "the analysis of the melting curve of the sequnce @xmath19 , which is challenging because standard ising models , as well as our model restricted to local effects , fail to give a correct melting curve , even at a qualitative level , showed the need of the introduction of the non - local effects of an at - rich region to get satisfactory results .",
