    "the recent discovery of a higgs - like boson at the lhc  @xcite represents a remarkable success for the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "however , within the sm the higgs mass is subject to additive renormalization , implying that a large hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the planck scale is technically unnatural  @xcite .",
    "one of few motivated models beyond the standard model ( bsm ) addressing this so - called fine - tuning problem is the framework of composite higgs models  @xcite with the higgs as a pseudo - nambu - goldstone - boson associated with the spontaneous breakdown of an approximate global symmetry of a sector which becomes strongly coupled at a scale @xmath4 .",
    "the global symmetry is explicitly broken by yukawa couplings of the higgs to the quarks and their composite partner states .",
    "integrating out the quark partners yields an effective potential for the higgs .",
    "the effective potential strongly depends on the embedding of the top quark partners into the global symmetry group as well as the top partner mass , while the lighter quark partners typically play a minor role .",
    "concrete realizations of composite higgs models @xcite , electroweak precision constraints @xcite , and top - partner phenomenology @xcite have already been studied , while only few articles focussed on bottom partners @xcite or partners of other light quarks @xcite .",
    "although typically not majorly contributing to electroweak symmetry breaking , light quarks need to be accompanied by composite partners in order to generate ( small but non - vanishing ) masses of the sm - like light quarks . the quark partner phenomenology depends on the embedding of the quarks and their partners into the global symmetry group of the composite sector , as well as their masses and couplings . in ref .",
    "@xcite , quark partners of the up and charm quarks were studied within the minimal composite higgs model based on @xmath0 .",
    "the right - handed quark partners were embedded in the @xmath5 of @xmath6 , which comprises of a @xmath7 and a singlet under the @xmath1 which is unbroken by strong dynamics .",
    "while bounds for the partners in the @xmath7 were obtained , the singlet partner remained unconstrained because of its suppressed couplings to electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "it was furthermore shown , that the presence of a light singlet state can substantially weaken the constraints on the partners in the fourplet , due to a combination of smaller production rates of fourplet states , and the opening of cascade decay processes of fourplet states via the singlet state .    in this article , we focus on constraints of quark partners in the @xmath1 singlet in composite higgs models based on the minimal coset @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] we discuss the two basic phenomenologically viable setups for composite quarks in the @xmath1 singlet , where the right - handed quark is either realized as an elementary quark which mixes with a composite partner ( partial compositeness ) or as a chiral state of the composite sector ( full compositeness ) .",
    "we establish effective lagrangians for both these models and use those in order to discuss their lhc phenomenology in in sec .",
    "[ sec : pheno ] . in particular we show that both setups can result in a substantial increase of di - higgs production above the sm background if the quark partners are light . in the current absence of direct bounds on the di - higgs production channel at the lhc",

    ", we are studying the singlet partner and therefore take the limit @xmath20 in which the fourplet partners decouple , while the singlet partner @xmath21 remains as the only bsm particle .",
    "the interactions of the @xmath21 depend on the embedding of the right - handed quarks .",

    "such an interaction can only arise from the @xmath60 component of the @xmath50 in the first term , but as the mixing in the left - handed sector is small ( of order @xmath61 ) , the `` mixing '' couplings are negligible .",
    "the same holds for mixing couplings of the @xmath62 gauge boson which follow from the analogous charged current interactions .",
    "the higgs couplings to the quark mass eigenstates follow from _ yuk = -_3 h |_l u_r+ = -^eff_mixh|u_h , lu_l , r- ^effh|u_h , lu_h , r+ with ^eff_mix&=&_3 ( ) = y_r g(),[lambdapceff ] + ^eff&=&_3 ( ) = y^2_r g()g ( ) .",

    "as long as the quark partner multiplet contains one @xmath1 singlet , and in the limit in which all other partner states are decoupled , the only dependence on the chosen representation enters through the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 in eq .   via the functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 in eq .   into the effective coupling @xmath64 in eq .  .",

    "<S> the presence of @xmath1 singlet partners leads to an enhancement of the di - higgs production cross section at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> this will be an interesting experimental signature in the near future , but , unfortunately , there are no direct bounds available yet from the experimental analyses . however , we find that the currently available standard model - like higgs searches can be used in order to obtain the first constraints on partially and fully composite quark models with light quark partners in the @xmath1 singlet . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a flavor- and composition parameter independent bound on the quark partner mass of @xmath2 for partially composite quark models and @xmath3 for fully composite quark models . </S>"
