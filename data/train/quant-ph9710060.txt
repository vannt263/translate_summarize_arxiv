    "during the recent years high - order harmonic generation ( hg ) has become one of the major topics of super intense laser - atom physics .",
    "generally speaking , high harmonics are generated when a short , intense laser pulse interacts with matter .",
    "although hg has been in the course of recent years mainly studied in atomic gases , it has also been investigated in ions , molecules , atom clusters and solids .",
    "apart from its fascinating fundamental aspects , hg has become one of the most promising ways of producing short - pulse coherent radiation in the xuv range .",
    "hg has already been a subject of several review articles @xcite .",
    "one can point out the following milestones in the short history of this subject :    * _ first observations _ high harmonic generation is an entirely nonlinear and non - perturbative process .",
    "the spectrum of high harmonics is characterized by a fall - off for the few low order harmonics , followed by an extended _ plateau _ , and by a rapid _ cut - off_. the first experimental observations of the plateau were accomplished by @xcite and @xcite in the end of 1980 s . * _ plateau extention _ most of the early work has concentrated on the extension of the plateau , i.e. generation of harmonics of higher frequency and shorter wavelength @xcite . by focusing short - pulse terawatt lasers in rare gas jets , wavelengths as short as 7.4 nm ( 143rd harmonic of a 1053 nm nd - glass laser @xcite ) , 6.7 nm ( 37th harmonic of a 248 nm krf laser @xcite ) and 4.7 nm ( 169th harmonic of an 800 nm ti - sapphire laser @xcite ) have been obtained . very recently , with ultra short intense infrared pulses , it has become possible to generate xuv radiation extending to the water window ( below the carbon k - edge at 4.4 nm ) @xcite . *",
    "_ simple man s theory _ a breakthrough in the theoretical understanding of hg process in low frequency laser fields was initiated by @xcite who have shown that the cut - off position in the harmonic spectrum follows the universal law @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the ionization potential , whereas @xmath2 , is the ponderomotive potential , i.e. the mean kinetic energy acquired by an electron oscillating in the laser field . here",
    "@xmath3 is the electron charge , @xmath4 is its mass , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the laser electric field and its frequency , respectively .",
    "pretty soon an explanation of this universal fact in the framework of `` simple man s theory '' was found @xcite . according to this theory ,",
    "harmonic generation occurs in the following manner : first the electron tunnels out from the nucleus through the coulomb energy barrier modified by the presence of the ( relatively slowly varying ) electric field of the laser .",
    "it then undergoes oscillations in the field , during which the influence of the coulomb force from the nucleus is practically negligible .",
    "finally , if the electron comes back to the vicinity of the nucleus , it may recombine back to the ground state , thus producing a photon of energy @xmath1 plus the kinetic energy acquired during the oscillatory motion .",
    "according to classical mechanics , the maximal kinetic energy that the electron can gain is indeed @xmath7 .",
    "a fully quantum mechanical theory , that is based on strong field approximation and that recovers the `` simple man s theory '' , was formulated soon after @xcite .",
    "* _ ellipticity studies _ the `` simple man s theory '' leads to the immediate consequence that harmonic generation in elliptically polarized fields should be strongly suppressed , since the electron released from the nucleus in such fields practically never comes back , and thus can not recombine @xcite . several groups have demonstrated this effect @xcite , and have since then performed systematic experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies of the polarization properties of harmonics generated by elliptically polarized fields . * _ optimization and control _ progress in experimental techniques and theoretical understanding has stimulated numerous studies of optimization and control of hg depending on various parameters of the laser and the active medium .",
    "these studies involved among others : * * _ optimization of laser parameters _ these studies concern for instance laser polarization ( discussed above ) , pulse duration or wavelength dependence @xcite .",
    "although typically infrared ( nd - glass or ti - sapphire ) lasers are used , generation by shorter wavelength intense krf lasers is also very efficient ( @xcite , for theory see @xcite ) . * * _ generation by multicolored fields _ harmonic generation in combined laser fields of two frequencies was studied in the context of ( i ) enhancement of conversion efficiency ( for theory see @xcite , for experiment cf .",
    "@xcite ) , ( ii ) access to new frequencies and tunability , if one of the fields is tunable ( for theory see @xcite , for experiments @xcite ) , and ( iii ) the control of hg process in general @xcite .",
    "* * _ optimization of the generating medium _ first of all , optimization with respect to atomic gases was studied @xcite .",
    "other active media apart from noble gases have been used to generate harmonics : ions ( these involve ionized noble gas atoms @xcite , and alkaline ions @xcite ) , molecular gases @xcite , atomic clusters @xcite etc . at this point",
    "it is worth adding that harmonic generation from solid targets and laser induced plasmas has also been intensively studied in the recent years ( for theory see @xcite , for experiments cf .",
    "@xcite ) . * * _ optimization and characteristics of spatial and temporal properties _ those studies concern spatial , temporal , and spectral properties of harmonic radiation , and in particular their coherence properties @xcite ; they are closely related to the subject of this review and will be discussed separately below .",
    "other examples of such studies involve spatial control of hg using spatially dependent ellipticity @xcite , control of phase matching conditions for low @xcite and high harmonics @xcite , role of ionisation and defocusing effects @xcite . * * _ other control schemes_. other control schemes of harmonic generation have been proposed that involve for example the coherent superposition of atomic states @xcite * _ applications _ high harmonics provide a very promising source of coherent xuv radiation , with numerous applications in various areas of physics . in particular , applications in atomic physics are reviewed by @xcite .",
    "harmonics have already been used for solid state spectroscopy @xcite , and plasma diagnostics @xcite .",
    "further applications that employ directly coherence properties of harmonics will be discussed in this review . *",
    "_ attosecond physics",
    "_ future applications of high harmonics will presumably involve attosecond physics , i.e. the physics of generation , control , detection and application of sub - femtosecond laser pulses .",
    "two types of proposals how to reach the subfemtosecond limit have been put forward over the last few years : those that rely on phase locking between consecutive harmonics @xcite , and those that concern single harmonics @xcite .",
    "both from the fundamental and practical points of view it is very important to know and understand the spatial and temporal coherence properties of high harmonics .",
    "informations on the spatial coherence of the beam and on its focusability , its spectrum and time profile are of direct interest for applications .",
    "but they also help in understanding the physics of the process , since there are many possible causes for distortion of the spatial and temporal profiles , and their interpretation implies a rather refined and deep study of the problem .",
    "the spatial distribution of the harmonic emission has been investigated by several groups in various experimental conditions .",
    "peatross and meyerhofer @xcite used a 1 @xmath8 m 1 ps nd - glass laser loosely focused ( f/70 ) into a very diluted gaseous media ( 1 torr ) in order to get rid of distortions induced by phase matching and propagation in the medium .",
    "the far - field distributions of the harmonics ( 11 to 41 ) generated in heavy rare gases were found to be quite distorted , with pedestals surrounding a narrow central peak .",
    "these wings were attributed to the rapid variation of the harmonic dipole phase with the laser intensity .",
    "tisch _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied high - order harmonics ( 71 to 111 ) generated by a similar laser , focused ( f/50 ) in 10 torr of helium .",
    "complex spatial distributions are found for harmonics in the plateau region of the spectrum .",
    "however , in the cutoff , the measured angular distributions narrow to approximately that predicted by lowest - order perturbation theory .",
    "the broad distributions with numerous substructures observed in the plateau are attributed to the influence of ionization , and in particular of the free electrons , on phase matching .",
    "the influence of ionization on spatial profiles has also been investigated experimentally by lhuillier and balcou @xcite for low - order harmonics in xenon , and , more recently , by wahlstrm _",
    "@xcite for harmonics generated by rare - gas - like ions . generally speaking",
    ", ionization induces a significant distortion of the harmonic profiles , thus complicating their interpretation . in a recent letter @xcite",
    ", we presented results of an experimental study of spatial profiles of harmonics generated by a 140 fs cr : lisralf6 ( cr : lisaf ) laser system .",
    "thanks to this very short pulse duration , it was possible to expose the medium to high intensities while keeping a weak degree of ionization . under certain conditions , the resulting harmonic profiles were found to be very smooth , gaussian to near flat - top , without substructure .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we present systematic experimental studies of harmonic angular distributions , investigating the influence of different parameters , such as laser intensity , nonlinear order , nature of the gas and position of the laser focus relative to the generating medium .",
    "we show that , when the laser is focused before the atomic medium , harmonics with regular spatial profiles can be generated with reasonable conversion efficiency .",
    "their divergence does not depend directly on the nonlinear order , the intensity or even the nature of the generating gas , but rather on the region of the spectrum the considered harmonic belongs to , which is determined by the combination of the three preceding elements .",
    "when the focus is drawn closer to the medium , the distributions get increasingly distorted , becoming annular with a significant divergence for a focus right within or after the jet .",
    "a first endeavour to measure the degree of spatial coherence of the harmonic radiation has been recently made by ditmire _",
    "@xcite with a young two - slit experiment .",
    "they investigated how the coherence between two points chosen to be located symmetrically relative to the propagation axis depends on the degree of ionization of the medium .",
    "finally , very recently far - field interference pattern created by overlaping in space two beams of the 13th harmonic , generated independently at different places in a xenon gas jet was observed @xcite .",
    "the experimental studies of temporal and spectral properties of high - order harmonics have also been carried out in different experimental conditions .",
    "temporal profiles of low harmonics generated by relatively long pulses ( several tens of ps ) were measured using a vuv streak camera by faldon _",

    "@xcite developed a cross - correlation method in which they ionize helium atoms by combining two pulses : the fundamental ( 800 nm , 150 fs ) from a ti : sapphire laser , and its 21-st harmonic ( 38 nm ) .",
    "these pulses generate characteristic electron spectra whose sidebands scale as the cross - correlation function which can be mapped out by varying the delay between the two pulses . using variants of this method bouhal",

    "the blue shift due to ionization has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas spectral properties of harmonics generated by chirped pulses have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of spatial distributions and temporal profiles of harmonics requires to combine a reliable single atom theory that describes the nonlinear atomic response to the fundamental field , with a propagation code that accounts for phase matching , dispersion etc .",

    "temporal profiles of low - order harmonics were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite performed calculations outside the slowly varying envelope approximation by solving simultaneously the equations for the atomic dynamics and propagation , using a one dimensional approximation .",
    "temporal and spectral profiles were studied in the strongly ionizing regime .    in the series of papers @xcite , we have developed a single atom theory which is a quantum - mechanical version of the two - step model of kulander _ et al .",

    "this theory has been combined with the theory of hg by macroscopic media @xcite to describe experimental results in a realistic manner . in a recent letter",
    "@xcite we have stressed the role of the dynamically induced phase of the atomic polarization in phase matching and propagation processes . in particular",
    "we have demonstrated the possibility of controlling the spatial and temporal coherence of the harmonics by changing the focusing conditions of the fundamental . we have performed numerical simulations of the angular distributions .",
    "the simulated profiles reproduced remarkably well the experimental trends and are thus used to interpret them in ref .",
    "the role of the intensity dependent phase of atomic dipoles was elaborated in more detail in ref .",

    "@xcite we present a short review of the various consequences of the intensity dependent phase .      as already stated above",
    ", the knowledge of the coherence properties of high harmonics is of major importance both for applications and from the fundamental point of view . although experimental and theoretical work has been already devoted to this subject , a systematic study of the spatial and temporal coherence properties of harmonics is still lacking . in particular , the implications of the existence of a phase of the harmonic dipole have not been fully explored .",
    "the aim of this review is to present a detailed theoretical study of this important subject .",
    "the theoretical approach used in this paper is very well established , and has been confronted numerous times with experimental results with great success .",
    "some of the results presented in this review have been published before and compared with experiments .",
    "many of the results , however , are either new , or have been only reported in the phd thesis of p. salires @xcite . nevertheless , we feel that very soon these results will find their experimental confirmation .    to some extent",
    "this review has a character of a case study , i.e. we discuss here in great detail quantitative coherence properties of a specific high harmonic in specific conditions etc .",
    "it is important , however , to keep in mind that the presented results are not only qualitatively , but also quantitatively valid in more general cases .",
    "we hope that these results will turn out usefull for anybody interested in applications of harmonics in general , and their extraordinary coherence properties in particular .",
    "the plan of the review is the following .",
    "in chapter 2 , we give an overview of theoretical approaches and describe our theoretical method : the single atom theory based on strong field approximation , and the propagation equations . since our theory has been discussed in detail in other publications , we limit ourselves to present the final expressions that we use for calculations of the physical quantities . in chapter 3",
    "we discuss the phase matching problem stressing the role of the dynamically induced phase of the atomic polarization @xcite .",
    "the combined effects of this phase and the phase of the fundamental beam depend on the atomic jet position relative to the focus .",
    "we investigate the influence of the jet position on the conversion efficiency .",
    "we show how the phase matching effects modify the cut - off law .",
    "chapter 4 starts with a short section devoted to the general definitions of the degree of coherence and characteristics of partially coherent beams .",
    "we then concentrate on the emission profiles and quality of the wavefronts of harmonics , both in the near - field and in the far - field zones .",
    "we also present calculations of the degree of spatial coherence of the harmonics .",
    "in chapter 5 we turn to the discussion of the temporal and spectral coherence .",
    "we show how the intensity dependence of the phase of the atomic polarization leads to a temporal modulation of the harmonic phase and to a chirp of its frequency . in both chapters 4 and 5 ,",
    "we relate our theoretical findings to experimental results .",
    "in particular , we use the parameters corresponding to experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite , and discuss systematically the dependence of the coherence properties of harmonics on the focus position of the fundamental .",
    "this parameter , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , allows us to control the degree of coherence ; optimal coherence properties are obtained when the fundamental is focused sufficiently before the atomic jet . in the final part of chapter 5 ,",
    "we discuss the possibility of optimizing and/or controlling the temporal and spectral properties of harmonics by making use of the dynamically induced chirp : temporal compression with a grating pair and spectral compression by using a chirped fundamental pulse .",
    "these ideas are confronted with the recent experiment of zhou _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and to the theoretical proposal of kulander @xcite .    in chapter 6",
    "we discuss future applications of harmonics with the special emphasis on their coherence properties .",
    "in particular we focus on applications in interferometry and on the short pulse effects .",
    "we discuss the possibility of generating and applying attosecond pulses .",
    "finally , we conclude in chapter 7 .",
    "the theory of harmonic generation in macroscopic media must necessarily contain two components : ( i ) a single atom theory that describes the response of an atom to the driving fundamental laser field , and ( ii ) a theory of propagation of the generated harmonics in the medium . in this chapter",
    "we outline various approaches to describe these two components of the theory .",
    "the single atom theory should describe the single atom response to a time - varying field of arbitrary intensity , polarization and phase .",
    "in other words , it should allow to calculate the induced atomic polarization , or dipole acceleration , which then can be inserted as a source in the propagation ( maxwell ) equations . in principle",
    "it is sufficient to describe the atomic response in the framework of the single active electron ( sae ) approximation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; for a discussion of two - electron effects see for instance @xcite ) . also for relatively long laser pulses ( of duration down to @xmath11 fs for nd - glass or ti - sapphire lasers ) one can use the adiabatic approximation , i.e. calculate the atomic response for the field of constant intensity , and only at the end integrate the results over the `` slowly '' varying envelope of the laser pulse .",
    "the discussion of the validity of the adiabatic approximation is presented in more detail in chapter 5 .",
    "there are essentially four methods that have been used to solve the problem of the single atom response :    * _ numerical methods _ these methods allow to solve the time dependent schdinger equation ( tdse ) describing an atom in the laser field . since ( at least in the adiabatic case ) the field oscillates periodically , one of the possible approaches is to use the floquet analysis ( @xcite ; for a recent review see @xcite ) , but the direct integration of the tdse is far more often used ( for a review see @xcite ) . in 1d such integration",
    "can be performed using either the finite element ( crank - nicholson ) , or split operator techniques ; in the context of harmonic generation it has been first used by the rochester group @xcite , but then employed by many others as a test method .",
    "+ in 3d the numerical method has been initiated by kulander @xcite , who used a 2d finite element ( `` grid '' ) method .",
    "pretty soon it was realized that basis expansion methods that employ the symmetry of the problem ( i.e. the spherical symmetry of a bare atom , or the cylindrical symmetry of an atom in the linearly polarized field ) work much better @xcite .",
    "modern codes use typically expansions in angular momentum basis , and solve the coupled set of equations for the radial wave function using finite grid methods ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , sturmian expansions @xcite or b - spline expansions @xcite .",
    "most of those codes are quite powerful and allow to calculate the atomic response directly without adiabatic approximation ( cf .",
    "unfortunately , they are quite time consuming , and it is therefore very hard to combine the results obtained from the numerical solutions of tdse with the propagation codes .",
    "the reason is that the single atom response in the physically interesting regime is typically a rapidly varying function of the laser intensity and other laser parameters .",
    "the propagation codes thus require very detailed data from single atom codes .",
    "this problem becomes even more serious in the absence of cylindrical symmerty ; real 3d numerical codes ( such as the ones describing generation by elliptically polarized fields ) have been developed only recently ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and obviously are even more time and memory consuming .",
    "+ nevertheless , many seminal results concerning harmonic generation has been obtained using direct numerical methods : from the first observation of the @xmath0 law @xcite , to the recent proposal of attosecond pulse generation @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting are the contributions of the oxford - imperial college group ( for a review see @xcite ) that concern among others hg by short wavelength lasers @xcite , pulse shape and blue shifting effects @xcite , role of strong ionization in hg @xcite , temporal aspects of harmonic emission @xcite , and the generation from the coherent superposition of atomic states @xcite .",
    "the tdse method has also been applied to molecules aligned in the laser field @xcite . * _ classical phase space avaraging method _ a lot of useful information about high harmonic generation processes can be gained from a purely classical analysis of the electron driven by the laser field . in order to mimic quantum dynamics ,",
    "classical newton equations are solved here for an ensemble of trajectories generated from an initial electron distribution in the phase space .",
    "this distribution is supposed to mimic the true quantum initial state of the system , so that averages over this distribution are analogs of quantum averages . such approach has been developed in the context of hg by maquet and his collaborators @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "* _ strong field approximation _ as already mentioned , the seminal paper on the @xmath0 law @xcite stimulated the formulation of the `` simple man s theory '' @xcite .",
    "originally , this theory has been formulated as a mixture of quantum and classical elements : first , the tunneling of the electron out from the nucleus was described using the standard adk @xcite theory of tunneling ionization .",
    "the subsequent oscillations of the electron in the laser field were described using classical mechanics .",
    "finally , electron recombination back to the ground state was calculated using the classical cross - section for the collision and the quantum mechanical recombination probability .",
    "+ a fully quantum mechanical theory , that recovers the `` simple man s theory '' in the semi - classical limit was formulated soon after @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on the strong field approximation ( sfa ) to the tdse .",
    "it is a generalization of the keldysh - faisal - reiss approximation @xcite , applied to the problem of harmonic generation .",
    "it was for the first time formulated in the context of harmonics by ehlotzky @xcite ; it is also strongly related to the , so called , becker model of an atom with a zero range pseudo - potential interacting with the laser field ( see below ) .",
    "+ in our formulation , the theory is based on the following assumptions : ( i ) it neglects all bound states of the electron in an atom with exception of the ground state ; ( ii ) all the states in the ionization continuum are taken into account , but in their dynamics only the part of the hamiltonian responsible for the oscillations of the free electron in the laser field is kept . technically , we disregard all off - diagonal continuum - continuum transitions that change electronic velocity . with this two assumptions ,",
    "the tdse becomes exactly soluble , and the resulting solutions are valid provided @xmath12 . in most of applications we treat the electronic states in the continuum as volkov plane waves , which additionally limits the validity of our approximation to electronic states with high kinetic energy , and thus to the description of the generation of high harmonics ( with photon energy @xmath13 ) .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that a heuristic scheme of accounting for coulomb potential effects in the continuum within the framework of sfa was proposed by @xcite . +",
    "originally our method has been formulated for linearly polarized laser fields in the adiabatic ( slowly varying intensity ) approximation @xcite .",
    "we have since then generalized it to elliptically polarized fields @xcite , two - color fields @xcite , and the fields with periodically time - dependent polarization @xcite , where all of those results were obtained in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "finally , the method has been generalized to the fields with arbitrary time - dependence without adiabatic approximation ( see chapter 5 ) .",
    "we have also performed intensive studies of the semiclassical approximation applied to our method in order to understand the harmonic emission in terms of semiclassical electron trajectories and feynman path integrals @xcite .",
    "these studies were essential for understanding the role of the intensity dependent phase of the nonlinear atomic polarization @xcite .",
    "they allowed also to understand the mechanism of electron trajectory selection in propagation , responsible for the generation of attosecond pulse trains @xcite .",
    "the advantage of our method , apart from its very transparent physical sense , is that it gives partially analytic results , allowing rapid calculation of the very precise data required for propagation codes .",
    "last , but not least , our method combined with propagation codes gives results in very good agreement with experiment ; it has become the standard theoretical method of analysis of experimental data in the saclay and lund groups ; it is also used by other groups @xcite . *",
    "_ pseudo - potential model _",
    "many important results in the theory of harmonic generation have been obtained by becker and his collaborators who have solved exactly ( and to a great extent analytically ) the zero range pseudo - potential model @xcite . in this model",
    "the electron is bound to the nucleus via the potential @xmath14 where @xmath4 is the electron mass .",
    "this potential supports a single bound state with the energy @xmath15 .",
    "+ this model , originally formulated in the case of a linearly polarized field , was also extended to one - color @xcite , and two - color @xcite fields with arbitrary polarization .",

    "the regular behaviour of the dipole in the cutoff region is due to the existence of only one main electron trajectory leading to the emission of the considered harmonic . on the contrary , in the plateau",

    "the dominant contribution is typically from the trajectory with the longer return time @xmath75 ( see section 2.2 )  it is the action along this trajectory which determines the mean slope of the intensity dependence of the phase .",
    "one should mention , however , that the mean slope of the intensity dependence is not always a good measure of the phase variations in the macroscopic medium .",
    "the reason is that propagation and phase matching may lead to a single trajectory selection that depends on the relative position of the atomic jet with respect to the focus @xcite . for the case",
    "when the jet is before , or close to the focus , phase matching usually selects the dominant trajectory with the return time @xmath75 , and the intensity dependence of the phase after the selection follows the mean slope of the total phase .",

    "we recall here some notions of the theory of partial coherence ( see , for example , born and wolf @xcite ) .",
    "the coherence of a beam is related to the correlation of the temporal fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields inside this beam .",
    "it is thus characterized by its mutual coherence function , defined for any two points inside the beam by : @xmath99 , where @xmath100 , @xmath101 are the complex amplitudes of the electric field in these two points , and the angular brackets denote an appropriate time average ( here , over the harmonic pulse ) .",
    "the normalized form of the mutual coherence function is the complex degree of coherence : @xmath102 whose modulus is known as the degree of coherence .",
    "the temporal coherence is described by @xmath103 , while the spatial coherence is described by @xmath104 .",
    "note that the latter , despite its name , is related to the correlation _ in time _ of the fields emitted in two points .",
    "these quantities determine the ability of the fields to interfere , and can be measured in interferometry experiments : in young s two - slit experiment , with both slits uniformly illuminated , @xmath105 at the slit positions is simply given by the fringe visibility , defined as @xmath106 ( where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the maximum and minimum intensities of the fringe pattern ) .",
    "the spatial coherence length of a beam at a given distance from its focus is defined as the length over which the degree of spatial coherence is larger than some prescribed value ( between 0.5 and 0.9 , depending on the authors , and on the coherence of their own source ... ) .",
    "another important aspect related to the coherence of a beam is the quality of its wavefront , an aspect that is often confused with the preceding description .",

    "[ nfphase3 ] we present the radial phases corresponding to these profiles .",
    "they all present a regular parabolic behavior , whose dependence is between @xmath112 and @xmath113 rad , @xmath91 being the radial coordinate in @xmath8 m . to understand the origin of these curved phase fronts , let us consider the phase of the polarization at the exit of the medium .",
    "given the low density , the harmonic field is obviously not mainly generated there , but this gives an estimate of what happens in the medium and can be directly compared to the phase of the generated harmonic field .",
    "there are two main contributions to the polarization phase : the first one is the gaussian fundamental field phase multiplied by the order : @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 is the beam waist , related to the confocal parameter by @xmath117 .",

    "this contribution can then be written as : @xmath119 we can here assume @xmath120 , since the harmonic profiles are much narrower than the fundamental . in chapter 3 , we have considered the first terms of both contributions , that correspond to variations _ on axis_. the second terms of these contributions , related to radial variations , both present a quadratic behavior .",
    "the term due to the focusing of the fundamental ( eq .",
    "( [ phasgauss ] ) ) is in fact the phase corresponding to a gaussian harmonic field with the same confocal parameter .",
    "its radial dependence is equal to @xmath121 rad and is thus significantly slower than the ones observed for the harmonic fields .",
    "the reason for the bigger curvature of the phase fronts is thus the additional radial variation introduced by the dipole phase ( second term in eq .",
    "( [ phasdip ] ) ) , which lies between @xmath122 and @xmath123 rad , depending on the considered intensity .",
    "these curved phase fronts have important consequences , as we shall see below .",
    "the harmonic fields emitted at 4 @xmath80 and 5 @xmath80 w/@xmath81 present gaussian profiles and quadratic phases at the exit of the medium , and thus correspond to lowest order gaussian modes , whose characteristics ( beam waist position and confocal parameter ) can be easily calculated .",
    "we find , in both cases , a virtual focus located at the laser focus ( like in the perturbative case ) but with an extremely small size : about 1.6 @xmath8 m ( even smaller than the perturbative 3.7@xmath8 m ) the corresponding confocal parameters are also very small ( about 1 mm ) , so that the harmonic fields at the exit of the medium are already as if they were in the far - field : spherical phase front centered at the focus and linear increase of the beam size with the distance from the focus .",
    "note that the radial variation of the phase of a spherical wave at a distance of @xmath110 mm is : @xmath124 rad , close to the observed variations .",
    "if we calculate the angular spread of these beams far from the jet , we find similar profiles , with half angle in @xmath125 between 3 and 5 mrad , that can be superimposed on the `` near - field '' profiles if their spatial dimension is calculated at a distance of @xmath110 mm .",
    "this is shown in dashed lines for the three intensities in fig .",
    "[ nfprof3 ] , where the horizontal scale is interpreted as the divergence ( half angle at half maximum ) and is simply related to the radial coordinate by : divergence(mrad)=0.26 @xmath126 m ( or @xmath127 divergence ) .",
    "note that the profile corresponding to 6 @xmath80 w/@xmath81 is more distorted by the propagation , due to its multimode structure , but its divergence is still governed by its curved phase front at the exit of the medium .",
    "finally , we can check the preceding conclusions concerning the virtual source size , and extend them to the case 6 @xmath80 w/@xmath81 , by `` back propagating '' these beams to their virtual focus .",
    "the solution of the propagation equations in free space for the complex conjugated field is formally equivalent to a time reversal , hence a `` back propagation '' .",
    "[ focus3 ] presents the profiles and phases of the harmonic beams corresponding to the preceding intensities , calculated at the laser focus position ( @xmath72 ) .",

    "the spot sizes are very small , close to the above estimates , with a minimum at 6 @xmath80 w/@xmath81 with a 1.4 @xmath8 m radius at @xmath125 .",
    "the very small size of the virtual source of the harmonic beams is a valuable information since it gives an indication on the size they can be refocused to ( assuming ideal refocusing without aberrations introduced by the optics , and no reduction factor ) . from this , we can estimate the achievable _ harmonic _ intensities , in view of applications .",
    "if we take an harmonic pulse duration of 66 fs ( see section v ) and an optimized number of photons of 10@xmath95 ( obtained by optimizing the pressure @xcite ) , the intensity at 18.3 nm ( 45th harmonic ) reaches about 5 @xmath128 w/@xmath81 .",
    "note that if argon is used as generating medium instead of neon , a much higher conversion efficiency is obtained for lower order harmonics : e.g. 10@xmath129 photons for the 19th harmonic @xcite .",
    "since the behaviour of the dipole moment is very general , whatever the ( sufficiently high ) order or the generating gas , we can extend our results to the 19th harmonic in argon , and we thus find an harmonic intensity of 2 @xmath130 w/@xmath81 at 43.4 nm . if a reduction factor is introduced by the refocusing optics , the very nice harmonic phase front should allow one to reach an even smaller focus size , and thus a higher intensity , provided that the surface figure of the optics is good enough .",

    "close to the propagation axis , the laser intensity , and thus the free electron density , varies slowly radially , preserving the coherence .",

    "note that in traditional , i.e. perturbative , low - order harmonic generation , where the harmonic dipole moment does not exhibit an intrinsic phase and depends regularly on the laser intensity , the coherence of the laser beam is simply transmitted to the harmonic beam . in conclusion , the dynamically induced phase plays a central role in determining the spatial characteristics of the generated harmonic beams , and especially their coherence properties , which are very sensitive to the focusing conditions .",
    "we have shown in the preceding chapter that the dynamically induced phase results in a dynamic phase matching due to the intensity distribution in the laser pulse .",

    "[ convstat ] ) , which leads to narrow peaks in the harmonic profile at half maximum of the laser envelope ( shown in dotted lines ) .",

    "[ spec ] . for a focusing sufficiently before the medium ,",
    "the spectra are quite narrow ( e.g. 0.4   fwhm at @xmath109 mm ) .",
    "when the jet is located at @xmath93 mm , the base of the profile gets broadened with superimposed oscillations . in @xmath72 , the profile is very broad with a fwhm of 4  .",
    "finally , in @xmath92 mm , the profile is again regular with a width of 2.2  .",
    "these large variations in spectral width can not be explained by variations in the intensity temporal profiles .",
    "note for example that in @xmath92 and @xmath109 mm , the temporal profiles are very similar with the same fwhm , whereas there is a factor of 5 between the corresponding spectral widths .",

    "phase_. calculations performed without taking into account their phase , i.e. assuming that the fields are fourier transform limited , give indeed much narrower spectra , with widths smaller than 0.15  .",
    "the origin of this phase modulation is the temporal variation of the dipole phase during the laser pulse .",
    "let us model the intensity dependence of the dipole phase by a linear decrease , whose slope @xmath118 depends on the region of the spectrum : in the cutoff @xmath138 rad/(w/@xmath81 ) and in the plateau @xmath139 rad/(w/@xmath81 ) .",
    "the induced modulation of the emitted harmonic field reads : @xmath140 where @xmath27 is the fwhm of the gaussian laser envelope .",

    "this phenomenon is thus very similar to self - phase modulation of an intense laser pulse in a kerr medium with a negative index @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "however , the phase modulation is here induced on the harmonic , whose temporal profile is different from that of the laser , and we shall see the consequences below .    the rising edge of the harmonic pulse is thus shifted to the blue , and the falling edge , to the red .",

    "the maximal broadening of the spectrum should thus be observed at focus , which experiences the largest intensity variation ( @xmath146 w/@xmath81 ) and where the intensity at the inflection points is still in the plateau region , ensuring the larger slope @xmath147 .",
    "this results in @xmath148  , close to the broadening observed for @xmath72 . however , this spectrum does not exhibit the characteristic grooved shape of the self phase modulation spectra .    let us recall the main features of self phase modulation @xcite .",
    "close to the inflection points , the instantaneous frequency varies slowly , unlike in the vicinity of the pulse maximum .",
    "the spectral density is thus maximum on the sides ( in @xmath149 ) and minimal at the central frequency . on the @xmath150 curve , there exist two points of the same slope , located on either side of the inflection point .",

    "the near - field spatial profile is annular due to an efficient phase matching off axis ( cf chapter 4 ) .",
    "let us consider the harmonic field in @xmath153 m at the exit of the medium , where the emission is efficient . the intensity profile , shown in dot - dashed line in fig .",

    "these fluctuations do not appear in the spatially integrated temporal profile of fig .",
    "[ temp ] , which is very regular .",
    "this implies that they are compensated by opposed oscillations of the emission in neighboring points .",
    "this can be understood by the variation of the phase front curvature in time , which leads to fluctuations of the angle of the emission cone .    in a given position ,",
    "one then sees the radiation going back and forth , hence these oscillations .",
    "the phase of the harmonic field , shown in solid line , varies much more rapidly than in @xmath109 mm .",
    "since the position considered is far from the axis , the maximum intensity corresponds to the cutoff region : @xmath154 w/@xmath81 , and the polarization phase at that point ( short - dashed line ) varies too slowly to explain the harmonic phase behavior .",
    "a good agreement is obtained if we take an intensity of @xmath155 w/@xmath81 , with the plateau slope @xmath147 ( long - dashed line ) .",
    "this implies that the harmonic radiation which exits the medium at that point has mainly been generated in a deeper region , close to the axis .",
    "the phase front curvature makes it diverge and exit at that position .",
    "the frequency chirp , presented in fig .",
    "[ mod1](b ) , shows the phase sudden changes of slope , reflecting the intensity fluctuations .",
    "the corresponding spectral width is about 2.2  , close to that of the full spectrum .",
    "the origin of the difference by a factor 5 of the spectral widths in @xmath109 and @xmath92 mm appears thus clearly : in @xmath109 mm , the harmonic emission corresponds to the cutoff region , hence a small slope @xmath147 and a low intensity . in @xmath92 mm , it is mainly in the plateau , with a slope twice as large , and for intensities at least two times larger .",
    "the spatial and spectral coherence properties are thus closely linked , and are both governed by the variations of the atomic phase .",
    "when the jet is placed several mm away from the focus , the intensity in the medium is sufficiently low to neglect the effects of ionization . in @xmath109 mm for example ,",
    "the profiles are only slightly modified .",
    "we will thus concentrate on the case @xmath92 mm , and try to separate the different effects : depletion of the atomic population , defocusing of the laser and phase mismatch both due to the generated free electrons .",
    "[ ioni](a ) presents the distortions of the temporal profile induced by the different effects . in short - dashed line",
    "is shown the profile corresponding to a peak pressure of 3 torr .",
    "this low pressure ensures that the free electron density is low enough to neglect its effects .",
    "this profile thus characterizes the incidence of the depletion of the medium on harmonic generation ( the susceptibility of the generated ions is supposed to be negligible compared to the atoms ) . at the center of the jet , ionization reaches 67% at the end of the laser pulse .",
    "the resulting profile is clearly asymmetric , with a rising edge hardly modified and a decrease of the efficiency on the falling edge .",
    "the fwhm is slightly decreased , from 67 to 63 fs .    at a pressure of 15 torr ,",
    "the effects of the free electrons are not any more negligible .",
    "we have first made the calculations by neglecting the defocusing of the laser : we suppose a gaussian propagation and we only solve the propagation equation for the harmonic field in the ionized medium .",
    "the temporal profile ( dot - dashed ) is even more distorted on the falling edge : the width decreases to 58 fs .",
    "this is due to the phase mismatch induced by the free electron dispersion , that reaches @xmath156 mm@xmath157 at the center of the jet and at the maximum of the pulse .",
    "the study of the propagation of the laser in the ionizing medium shows clearly an effect of defocusing : at the exit of the medium ( 0.2 mm from the focus ) , the maximum intensity is reduced by 17% , to 5 @xmath80 w/@xmath81 . the reduced intensity experienced by the medium results in a smaller ionization degree : 54% at the center of the jet and at the end of the pulse ( vs 67% ) .",
    "a consequence of the defocusing is thus to reduce the amplitude of the preceding effects : less depletion and smaller free electron density .",
    "however , the corresponding temporal profile ( long - dashed ) is the most distorted one .",
    "the efficiency drops abruptly after the maximum of the pulse , leading to a width of 46 fs .",
    "two elements can explain this decrease in efficiency .",
    "first , the reduced intensity induces a decrease of the polarization amplitude .",
    "second , the defocusing changes the intensity distribution in the medium compared to the gaussian .",
    "the atomic phase distribution is thus modified , which may result in a less efficient phase matching .    in fig .",
    "[ ioni](b ) we show the incidence of these phenomena on the spectrum .",
    "a striking feature is that , whatever the effect considered , the distortions of the spectrum simply follow the distortions of the temporal profile .",
    "the blue side of the spectrum is weakly affected , whereas its red side is progressively cut off .",
    "the fwhm decreases first from 2.2 to 1.9    due to the depletion ( 3 torr ) , then to 1.6   due to the phase mismatch induced by the free electrons at 15 torr , and finally to 1.5   when the defocusing of the laser is taken into account .",
    "this is a clear illustration of the phase modulation phenomenon . since the rising edge of the harmonic pulse",
    "is weakly affected by ionization , it is also the case for the blue side of the spectrum it is associated to . on the contrary the falling edge , and consequently the red side of the spectrum , are strongly distorted .",
    "this results in a blueshift of the central frequency of the spectrum .",
    "note that this phenomenon is different from the blueshift induced by the temporal variation of the free electron density , and thus of the refractive index @xcite . in our conditions , the latter effect shifts the fundamental spectrum by 2.4  , which results for the 45th harmonic in a shift of only 0.05  .",
    "the phase modulation studied below can be used to control the temporal and spectral properties of the harmonic radiation . in the time domain , the regular close - to - quadratic phase , and the corresponding linear chirp ,",
    "lead to the possibility of compressing the harmonic pulse with a pair of gratings , as is done in cpa lasers .",

    "we will discuss the short duration problem in the next section , and we concentrate here on the study of the compression of the _ macroscopic _ harmonic beam .    to simulate the compression",
    ", we subtracted a mean quadratic phase from the phase of the spectrum emitted at each point at the exit of the medium .",

    "the profile is very narrow , with a fwhm of 10 fs ( vs. 66 fs before compression , dashed line ) .",
    "this is close to the fourier transform limit .",
    "the short duration is maintained when the pressure is increased to 15 torr ( dot - dashed line ) . in @xmath92 mm , the compressed profile for a pressure of 3 torr is even narrower , as shown in solid line in fig .",
    "[ compress](b ) : 6 fs vs. 67 fs before compression .",
    "note that on the basis of the spectral width which is more than three times larger than in @xmath109 mm , we would have expected a smaller duration .",
    "however , this optimal compression is not reached due to temporal fluctuations in the phase ( see fig . [ mod1 ] ) and to spatial inhomogeneities of the phase modulation .",
    "phase matching has thus to be considered carefully in order to get the shortest harmonic pulses . at a pressure of 15 torr , not only",
    "is the spectral width reduced ( due to defocusing of the laser , see preceding section ) , but also the free electron dispersion introduces a temporally - varying phase shift on the harmonic emission .",

    "this is certainly caused by phase fluctuations induced by the free electron dispersion .    in conclusion",

    "_ @xcite : for negative fundamental chirps , they observe a very pronounced broadening whereas for positive chirps , the peaks remain relatively narrow .",
    "however , the experiments were performed in argon at a relatively high intensity , thus with a higher degree of ionization than considered here .",
    "harmonic generation occurs then only on the rising edge of the laser pulse , resulting in significant redshifting or blueshifting ( depending on the fundamental chirp ) of the harmonic radiation .      so far , we have considered harmonic generation by laser pulses of 150 fs duration .",
    "the recent advent of lasers of duration 25 fs and less , sufficiently intense to generate harmonics , motivates the investigation of shorter pulse effects .",
    "except for the influence of ionization which depends directly on time , our results are simply scalable to shorter durations as long as the approximations made still apply : for example , going from 150 to 25 fs laser pulses ( while keeping the same peak intensity ) would result in a shortening of a factor 6 of the harmonic temporal profile and a corresponding broadening of the same factor of the spectrum .",
    "what about our approximations ?",
    "the slowly varying envelope approximation _ for the propagation _ of the harmonic field is valid for very short laser pulses since the harmonic period is much less than 1 fs .",
    "however , the very broad spectra of the generated harmonics may overlap and interfere , making the propagation calculations more difficult .",
    "but the main problem is to take into account the nonadiabatic response of the nonlinear polarization to the fast driving field . in our calculations ,",
    "we consider that the harmonic dipole moment follows adiabatically ( or reacts instantaneously to ) the intensity distribution of the laser pulse . in particular",
    ", we consider that the laser field amplitude does not vary significantly over the optical period . for the very short pulses mentionned above",

    "in fact , harmonics in the cutoff are created close to the peak of the laser pulse , where the intensity varies slowly .",
    "nonadiabatic phenomena may play a role in the plateau region , where the harmonics are also generated on the edges of the laser envelope . in the cutoff",
    ", the main nonadiabatic effect seems thus to be the shift in time of the atomic response .",
    "note that if we take a sine laser field instead of a cosine , the harmonic temporal profile is slightly modified , exhibiting a double peak structure for the same width .",
    "this is an indication that we are close to the limit of validity of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "another important element is the width of the spectrum .",
    "it spans one laser photon energy ( 1.5 ev ) on either side of the harmonic frequency .",
    "this means that for shorter pulse durations , the spectra of adjacent harmonics will overlap and interfere , leading to a perturbed behaviour also in the cutoff region .",
    "note that a nonadiabatic effect has been invoked by christov _",
    "_ to explain the delayed ionization with short laser pulses ( 25 fs ) and the corresponding increase in harmonic plateau extension @xcite .",
    "high order harmonics are currently used in a number of applications such as atomic and molecular spectroscopy , solid state physics ...",
    "( for a review , see ref .",
    "we focus here on potential applications involving their coherence properties .",
    "indeed , the main message of the studies presented in chapters 3 - 5 is that harmonics can be generated in the form of short , but spatially and temporally coherent pulses .",
    "moreover , the properties of such pulses can be to a great extent and on many aspects controlled .",
    "therefore , one can foresee three very interesting classes of possible applications of harmonic pulses : applications in nonlinear optics in the xuv , that employ the high refocused harmonic intensities , applications in interferometry , that employ spatial coherence properties , and applications in attosecond physics , that employ the phase modulation and other phase properties to reduce the duration of harmonic pulses . in this chapter",
    "we present a somewhat speculative discussion of these three classes of applications , since none of them has been realized so far .      in chapter 4",
    ", we have shown that the good wavefront quality of the harmonic beam could allow us to refocus it quite easily to very small spots of a few @xmath8 m in diameter using simply a spherical mirror . recently",
    ", the saclay group has confirmed this prediction by measuring the size of the focal spot , and its dependence on the medium characteristics @xcite .",
    "even better focusing could be achieved by using a schwarzschild objective @xcite .    if the short pulse character of the emission is preserved , which implies the use of multilayer mirrors to select and refocus the harmonic beam , unprecedented high intensities could be reached in the xuv region .",
    "for instance , if argon is used as generating medium , an optimized number of 10@xmath158 photons could be generated around 30 ev .",
    "schafer and kulander @xcite found that the conversion efficiency at the single atom level increases roughly as quickly as the laser pulse duration decreases , resulting in the emission of about the same number of harmonic photons . using the intense 25 fs infrared lasers currently available , an harmonic pulse duration of less than 10 fs could be obtained ( note that the generation of sub - femtosecond pulses is under consideration , see below ) .",
    "the refocused harmonic intensity would thus reach 10@xmath159 w/@xmath81 , enough to induce multiphoton processes .",
    "some attempts have already been done to observe non - resonant two - photon ionization of rare gases @xcite .",
    "they are for the moment unsuccessfull , except for moderate - order harmonics @xcite , but the rapid progress in short pulse laser technology ( repetition rate , pulse duration and energy ) will improve the performances of the harmonic sources and should make possible the observation of such processes in the near future .",
    "interferometry with harmonics is particularly interesting because of their high frequency and short duration .",
    "coherent harmonics of high frequencies would pass many interesting media without significant absorbtion .",
    "of particular interest are the dense laser - induced plasmas .",
    "short wavelengths are much less sensitive than visible ones to refraction by the large density gradients involved , and correspond moreover to higher critical densities .",
    "furthermore , due to their short duration , the harmonics may probe dynamics of many systems in a quasi - instantaneous way .",
    "interferometry with harmonics thus appear as a powerful diagnosis for different medias , and in particular plasmas .",
    "the broad harmonic bandwith ( correlated to the short pulse duration ) makes rather difficult to use an amplitude division interferometer ( michelson s type ) at the harmonic frequency , but the good spatial coherence is well suited for wavefront division interferometers ( young s type ) .",
    "two kinds of possible interferometry experiments are discussed by experimentalists : in one kind , two correlated harmonic beams are used ( like in @xcite ) , out of which one may , and the other does not pass through the medium to be diagnosed ; both beams interfere thereafter .",
    "realization of such experiment may pose , however , difficulties in achieving sufficient spatial and temporal overlap of the two harmonic pulses .",
    "the other kind of experiment involves only one harmonic beam which would pass through a region of spatially non - uniform index of refraction , and produce a self - interference pattern thereafter .",
    "numerous applications of this last scheme in solid state and plasma diagnostics are currently being considered by experimentalists in saclay .",
    "note finally that the harmonic spatial coherence could be used in holographic or phase - contrast imaging .",
    "in particular , the harmonic generation spectrum has now reached the water window ( between the k - edges of carbon at 4.4 nm and oxygen at 2.3 nm @xcite ) .",
    "this region is of particular interest for biological applications since it provides the best contrast for hydrated carbonated structures such as living cells .",
    "the shortest pulses achieved today ( 5 fs in the infrared @xcite ) are limited by the long period of the radiation .",
    "shorter wavelengths are required for further pulse shortening .",
    "high - order harmonics are the most promising way to generate subfemtosecond , i.e. attosecond ( as ) , pulses .",
    "different schemes have been proposed to reach these extremely short durations .",
    "the first one deals with the relative phase of the harmonics generated in the plateau region @xcite .",
    "if they were emitted in phase , the corresponding temporal profile would consist of a _",
    "train _ of pulses separated by half the laser period and of duration in the attosecond range .",
    "there is a clear analogy here with mode - locked lasers .",
    "however , early calculations of the single atom response showed that the high harmonics were , in general , not in phase , due to the interference of various energetically allowed electronic trajectories leading to the harmonic emission .",
    "recently , antoine _ et al .",
    "_ revived this proposal by showing that the propagation in the atomic medium could select one of these trajectories , resulting in the macroscopic emission of a train of @xmath160 200 attosecond pulses @xcite .    in principle , the proposals based on phase locking require filtering of the phase locked harmonics from the entire spectrum ; in particular they require suppression of the low harmonics from the fall - off region of the spectrum .",
    "it is worth mentioning that trains of attosecond pulses could also be generated in laser - induced plasmas from the surface of a solid target .",
    "harmonic generation from solid targets has been intensively studied in the recent years both experimentally @xcite , and theoretically @xcite , but only very recently have the temporal aspects of such a generation process been studied @xcite . using a simple model of the oscillating plasma surface , as well as a 1d `` particle  in  cell '' code",
    ", these authors have shown that the reflected signal obtained in the case of normal incidence of the driving laser has the form of a train of ultrashort pulses of duration @xmath161 times shorter than the optical period ( i.e. @xmath162 attoseconds for the case of ti- sapphire laser ) .",
    "this is quite surprising because the harmonic spectrum is monotonically decreasing and does not exhibit any plateau , and moreover , the production of those pulses does not require any filtering",
    ".    furthermore , corkum _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a way of generating a _ single _ pulse by using the high sensitivity of harmonic generation in gases to the laser polarization @xcite . by creating a laser pulse whose polarization is linear only during a short time , close to a laser period",
    ", the emission could be limited to this interval .",
    "propagation calculations validated this idea @xcite . in their original proposal ,",
    "corkum _ et al .",
    "_ suggested to use two cross polarized fundamental beams of slightly different frequencies in order to obtain the desired form of the time dependent polarization .",
    "very recently , the lund group has realized this idea in a somewhat different way @xcite , by using a flat birefringent crystal and a short input pulse that is chirped in frequency and polarized at 45 degrees relative to the optical axis of the crystal .",
    "the input chirped pulse in such a system is split into two orthogonally polarized chirped pulses delayed in time .",
    "when the phase difference between the two polarizations is zero , linear polarization is produced .",
    "this enables a single ultrashort time window to be selected for efficient harmonic generation .",
    "moreover , two or more ultrashort time windows with controllable delay may be selected .",
    "another scheme of ultrashort pulse generation has been described in the preceding section , and concerns a single harmonic . the compression of the dynamically induced frequency chirp of an harmonic located at the end of the plateau and generated by a 27 fs laser pulse can result in a pulse of 1.7 fs duration . moreover",
    ", schafer and kulander proposed to compress three adjacent harmonics to generate @xmath160 400 as pulses @xcite .",
    "this is made possible by the fact that harmonics located close to the cutoff exhibit approximately the same frequency chirp .",
    "finally , the last scheme uses very short duration laser pulses to shorten even more the harmonic emission , thanks to the rapid ionization of the medium ( less than one cycle ) .",
    "as already mentioned , with 5 fs infrared pulses it has become recently possible to generate soft xuv radiation extending to the k - edge of carbon at 4.4 nm ( water window ) @xcite .",
    "simulations show that the generated pulses could be of sub-500 attosecond duration @xcite .",
    "although the problem of generating attosecond pulses is already difficult , it is even more challenging to consider their detection , and applications .",
    "so far , the literature on those subjects hardly exist , but theoretical studies have begun .",
    "corkum and his collaborators @xcite discuss possible applications of subfemtosecond pulses in physical chemistry .",
    "these authors discuss , for instance , coulomb explosion measurements for molecules in strong laser fields ; such measurements allow to measure time - dependent molecular structures .",
    "the use of attosecond pulses for such measurments would allow to `` freeze '' the nuclear motion for even highly charged molecular ions by their inertia for the duration of the pulse , and thus achieve much better temporal resolution than it is possible so far .",
    "an experimental detection of the train of attosecond pulses is equivalent to the detection of phase locking .",
    "the latter can be studied for instance in the process of two - photon ionization of helium atoms by a filtered harmonic signal consisting of 5 - 10 harmonics .",
    "the ionization yield in such a process should depend on the relative phases between the harmonics @xcite .",
    "maquet and his collaborators in a series of papers has investigated the possibility of determining the relative phases between the harmonics and the fundamental field from the above threshold ionization ( ati ) spectra . in refs .",
    "@xcite ati in a two color field ( fundamental plus one high harmonic frequency ) was cansidered .",
    "the spectra in that case may be strongly affected by quantum interferences between different ionization and electron redistribution channels , and depend on the relative phase between the two fields . in further publication",
    "@xcite the authors considered ati in a mixed multicolor field consiting of the fundamental and several high harmonic components .",
    "the detailed study of photoionisation spectra provides in this case more , or less direct information on the phase differences between successive harmonics .",
    "comparison with experimental results @xcite suggests that indeed harmonics generated in rare gases are phase locked .",
    "another possibility of detection and application of attosecond pulses would be to develop the time resolved attosecond spectroscopy ( tras ) .",
    "this could be done in analogy with femtosecond spectroscopy , using a pump and probe attosecond pulses , for example to excite and then ionize a coherent sub - rydberg wave packet in an atom .",
    "the result of such pump  probe process should depend on the time delay between the pump and the probe .    in the review",
    "@xcite we suggested that tras could also be realized by mixing an attosecond pulse train ( the probe ) with the strong fundamental laser beam ( the pump ) .",
    "in particular , we have considered harmonic generation by such multicolored fields , expecting that the resulting harmonic signal would depend on the time delay ( modulo one fundamental period ) between the train and the pump . unfortunately , as we already pointed out in @xcite , the estimates presented in that paper , based on sfa , are too optimistic .",
    "we have checked , using tdse method , that the dependence of the harmonic signal on the time delay in such process is much weaker in the experimentally accessible regime of parameters .",
    "nevertheless , the scheme allows at least to study temporal interference between the train of pulses focused in the medium ( probe ) , and the train of pulses generated in the medium by the fundamental laser ( pump )",
    ". this interference can be particularly efficient due to phase matching effects , such as trajectory selection via propagation @xcite .",
    "other processes than harmonic generation , can be considered in order to make tras with attosecond pulse trains , or separated attosecond pulses possible . in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors consider ati process by a fundamental laser pulse that leads to the resonant excitation of dynamically stark - shifted rydberg states .",
    "short harmonic pulse ( of duration much shorter than the fundamental one ) is applied during that process , and its delay with respect to the front of the fundamental pulse is controlled . as a result , the highly structured ati spectra depend on the delay of the probe , and provide thus the first example of time - resolved spectrocopy of dynamically induced resonances .",
    "the quest for other forms of tras remains , in our opinion , one of the most interesting challenges of super - intense laser atom physics .",
    "we have used a theory of high order harmonic generation by low frequency laser fields in the strong field approximation to study the spatial and temporal coherence properties of the harmonic radiation .",
    "we show that the intensity dependence of the atomic dipole phase predicted by this model plays a central role in the way phase matching is achieved in the medium . in particular , it introduces an asymmetry relative to the position of the jet compared to the laser focus . when the laser is focused sufficiently before the jet , phase matching is optimized on axis , leading to very regular gaussian emission profiles . when it is focused in or after the medium , harmonic generation is prevented on axis but can be efficient off axis resulting in annular profiles .",
    "moreover , the dipole phase induces a big curvature on the generated harmonic phase front , leading to quite diverging harmonic beams .",
    "consequently the virtual source of the emission presents a very small size .",
    "temporal fluctuations of the harmonic phase front can degrade the spatial coherence of the radiation , in particular for a focusing after the jet .",
    "however , before the jet , the spatial coherence can be very high indicating that high order harmonics could be a useful coherent source in the xuv",
    ".    induced by the intensity distribution in the laser pulse , the dynamic phase matching results in very regular , narrow temporal profiles for focus positions sufficiently before or after the jet . at intermediate positions ,",
    "the harmonic profiles are distorted and almost as large as the fundamental .",
    "the corresponding spectra are very broad and far from the fourier transform limit .",
    "this is due to the intensity dependence of the dipole phase , which results in a phase modulation of the emitted harmonic field .",
    "this phase modulation is all the more important as the peak intensity is high and the harmonic emission is in the plateau region , where the slope of the intensity dependence is the larger .",
    "the harmonic beam thus presents a negative chirp , with a rising edge shifted to the blue and a falling edge , to the red . in our conditions , ionization is quite limited and affects mainly the falling edge , and thus the red part of the spectrum .",
    "the regular phase modulation can be used to control the temporal and spectral properties of the harmonic radiation .",
    "temporally , the chirped pulse could be recompressed by a pair of gratings to very small durations .",
    "spectrally , an appropriately designed chirp on the fundamental can compensate ( or increase , depending on its sign ) the harmonic dynamic chirp , resulting in a narrow ( or extremely broad ) spectrum .",
    "finally , we show that cutoff harmonics generated by pulses as short as 27 fs can be described by an adiabatic calculation , the nonadiabatic phenomena being negligible .    in conclusion ,",
    "the spatial and temporal coherence properties of high order harmonics are closely related , and depend strongly on the atomic dipole phase .",
    "however , the regular behavior of the latter makes it possible to control them by using relatively simple means .",
    "these unprecedented coherence properties in the xuv region open the way to a new class of potential applications which are attracting more and more interest . the good wavefront quality , that allows focusing to very small focal spots , together with the short pulse duration could result in the high focused intensities necessary to perform nonlinear optics in the xuv",
    ". the high spatial coherence makes it possible to realize xuv interferometry experiments , such as ultrashort plasmas diagnostics .",
    "finally , the harmonic phase characteristics in time could be used to generate attosecond pulses , the shortest ever , opening the way to `` attosecond physics '' .",
