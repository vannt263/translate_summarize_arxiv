    "lattice qcd has made enormous progress over the last years due to computational and algorithmic advances @xcite . this has led to significantly improved lattice calculations of many low - energy observables .",
    "present - day unquenched lattice calculations are performed with quark masses close to or at their physical value @xcite .",
    "uncertainties associated with the chiral extrapolation are essentially eliminated in these simulations .    however , dynamical lattice qcd with small quark masses may face new problems .",
    "one feature of unquenched lattice simulations is the presence of multi - particle states in the correlation functions measured to obtain observables . with the up and down quark masses getting closer to their physical values",
    "one expects multi - particle states with additional pions to become a significant excited - state contamination in many correlation functions . as a simple example consider the two - point function @xmath0 of a nucleon interpolating field , as it is measured to extract the nucleon mass @xmath1 . from the spectral decomposition",
    "the two - point function in a finite spatial volume , projected to zero momentum , is a sum of exponentials , @xmath2 the first exponential provides the exponential decay with the nucleon mass , @xmath3 .",
    "all the other terms stem from states with the same quantum numbers as the nucleon , either genuine single - particle excited states or multi - particle states . for sufficiently small pion masses",
    "one expects a nucleon - pion state to be the state with lowest total energy next to the ground state , @xmath4 . for symmetry reasons the nucleon and the pion can not be at rest .",
    "both have non - zero but opposite spatial momenta determined by the spatial volume and the boundary conditions imposed in the spatial directions .",
    "still , for sufficiently large spatial volumes the exponent @xmath5 can be smaller than the first one - particle excited state , associated with the roper resonance @xmath6 in infinite volume .",
    "moreover , near physical quark masses the three - particle state containing the nucleon and two pions at rest will have a smaller energy than the one - particle excited state .",
    "the way to deal with multi - particle states in spectroscopy calculations is well - known .",
    "the well - established variational method @xcite can be used provided interpolating fields for the multi - particle states are taken into account .",
    "still , the more states one takes into account the larger is the generalized eigenvalue problem one has to solve numerically , and the error bounds for the energies derived in @xcite get worse the denser the spectrum is .    in this paper we provide some analytical results concerning the nucleon two - point function . as has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) can be employed to obtain an estimate for the ratio @xmath7 . moreover , to leading order in the chiral expansion one expects the ratio @xmath7 to be independent of the a priori unknown low - energy constant ( lec ) associated with the particular choice for the interpolating field . in that sense lo chpt makes a rather definite prediction for @xmath7 .",
    "even if this result will receive substantial higher order corrections we do obtain a reliable first estimate for the impact of the nucleon - pion - state contribution to the two - point function .",
    "the results we find for @xmath7 are small .",
    "for example , for a pion mass satisfying @xmath8 and @xmath9 we find @xmath10 .",
    "taking into account the additional exponential suppression the two - particle - state contribution in ( [ expansatz ] ) contributes at the few - percent level for euclidean times of about 0.5 fm . for larger @xmath11 and in the effective mass the contribution is even smaller . whether it is noticeable in practice is then a question of the size of the statistical errors in the lattice data .",
    "the nucleon - pion - state contribution to the two - point function has been independently computed in ref .",
    "the computation in that reference is performed in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) , while here we employ the covariant formulation . in particular the chiral expressions for the interpolating fields",
    "differ in these two formulations , thus the final results are not the same . however , performing the appropriate expansion of our results we reproduce the results given in ref .",
    "throughout this article we consider qcd in a finite spatial box .",
    "@xmath12 denotes the box length in each direction and periodic boundary conditions are assumed . the euclidean time extent , however ,",
    "is taken infinite .",
    "this choice implies an exponential decay of two - point functions and simplifies our calculations .",
    "still , this simplification is a good approximation for many lattice qcd simulations .",
    "another simplification concerns the masses of the up and down type quarks which we assume to be equal .",
    "consequently , all three pions as well as the nucleons ( proton and neutron ) are mass degenerate .",

    "@xmath13 itself is an interpolating field with the quantum numbers of the nucleon .",
    "various choices are possible and we discuss concrete examples in the next subsection . for the moment we do not need to specify @xmath13 any further .",
    "let us consider the positive parity correlator .",
    "the integration over the spatial volume in eq .",
    "( [ defncorr ] ) projects on states with zero total momentum .",
    "hence , in the spectral decomposition of the correlator for large euclidean times @xmath18 the dominant contribution comes from the single - particle state with the particle being the nucleon at rest , @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the nucleon state and @xmath21 denotes the nucleon mass .",
    "the interpolating field excites other states with the same quantum numbers as well .",
    "the contribution of an excited nucleon has the same form as eq .",
    "( [ spcontr ] ) with the appropriate mass @xmath22 .",
    "in addition we expect contributions from multi - hadron states . for sufficiently small pion masses",
    "the dominant multi - hadron states are those containing additional pions .",
    "for the two - particle nucleon - pion state contribution one finds @xmath23 is the total energy of the state and @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the individual energies of the nucleon and the pion , respectively . for weakly interacting pions",
    "@xmath26 equals approximately the sum @xmath27 .",
    "the sum over momenta runs over all momenta allowed by the boundary conditions imposed for the finite spatial volume , e.g.  @xmath28 with @xmath29 having integer - valued components .",
    "a simple dimensional analysis can be employed to make the volume suppression more quantitative .",
    "assume the interpolating fields are local 3-quark - operators without derivatives .",
    "in that case the mass dimension of the matrix elements in ( [ spcontr ] ) and ( [ tpcontr ] ) are 7/2 and 5/2 , respectively . making the naive assumption",
    "@xmath30 we can estimate the ratio of the two - particle and one - particle contributions as @xmath31 if we assume the values @xmath32 mev and @xmath33 fm we roughly find @xmath34^{-1}\\approx 1/30 $ ] .",
    "the additional factors suppress the two - particle state contribution further , so we expect its contribution to the correlator to be rather small .",
    "states with more than one pion contribute analogously to ( [ tpcontr ] ) , but each additional pion contributes an additional factor @xmath34^{-1}$ ] , i.e.  the more pions in the state the larger the suppression of its contribution with the spatial volume .",
    "our discussion applies to the negative parity correlator as well . in this channel",
    "the lightest single - particle state is , in infinite volume , the @xmath35 . however , the state with the lowest energy is the nucleon - pion state with both particles at rest , provided the pion mass is sufficiently small .",
    "thus the two - particle state dominates the long time behaviour and the ratio analogous to the one in ( [ naiveest ] ) will diverge for @xmath36 in the negative parity channel .",
    "as already mentioned , there exist many choices for the interpolating field ( `` operator '' ) @xmath13 with the quantum numbers of the nucleon .",
    "the number is significantly reduced if we consider local operators composed of three quark fields at the same point @xmath37 . if , in addition , we constrain ourselves to operators without derivatives there exist only five different ones . as a consequence of fierz identities only two are independent @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and we focus on those . in order to write them down",
    "it is convenient to introduce the quark field doublet @xmath38 as @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the isospin doublet of the quark fields , @xmath41 denotes the dirac spinor charge conjugation matrix satisfying @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the second ( isospin ) pauli matrix . with these definitions",
    "the two nucleon operators can be written as @xmath44   n_2\\,=\\ , ( \\tq \\gamma_5 q ) \\gamma_5q\\ , .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] this compact form suppresses the contraction of the isospin and dirac indices in the bilinear quark fields @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( `` diquarks '' ) and the summation over the color indices with an @xmath47 to form a color singlet .",
    "the nucleon operators @xmath48 are still isospin doublets . to project onto the quark content of the proton and neutron we need to contract with the isospin basis vectors @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "however , in our case with preserved isospin symmetry any unit vector would be equally good .    in the next section",
    "we need the counterparts of the nucleon operators @xmath48 in chpt .",
    "the mapping follows the standard procedure and rests on the transformation properties of @xmath48 under chiral and parity transformations .",
    "the transformation properties under ( singlet and non - singlet ) chiral transformations have been studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we simply summarize the relevant results .",
    "we decompose the quark fields into right- and left - handed components , @xmath51 , with the usual chiral projectors @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "it then follows that the field in ( [ qtilde ] ) also decomposes according to @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the group of non - singlet chiral transformations is @xmath57 , and under transformations @xmath58 the chiral quark fields transform according to @xmath59 \\tilde{q } & = &   \\tilde{q}_r + \\tilde{q}_l & \\xrightarrow{\\,r , l\\ , } & \\tilde{q}_r \\,r^{\\dagger }   + \\tilde{q}_l \\,l^{\\dagger}\\ , .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] the diquarks decompose into @xmath60 and @xmath61 , hence they transform as singlets under chiral transformations . consequently , the transformation behavior of the nucleon operators is determined by the third quark field contribution @xmath62 and @xmath63 , given in ( [ chiraltrafoq ] ) .",
    "decomposing this quark field into right- and left - handed components the complete nucleon fields @xmath64 itself can be written as a sum of a right - handed and a left - handed term with the following transformation behavior under chiral transformations : @xmath65 concerning parity one finds that @xmath66 and @xmath67 transform as a scalar and a pseudo scalar , respectively .",
    "thus , both @xmath68 and @xmath69 transform as a dirac spinor under parity , @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71    so far we considered local interpolating fields only . in lattice",
    "qcd so - called smeared interpolators are very often used , mainly to suppress excited - state contributions in the correlation function . smeared nucleon interpolating fields",
    "are formed as in ( [ defn12 ] ) but with the local quark fields replaced by smeared ones , which are generically of the form @xmath72 with some gauge covariant kernel @xmath73 which is essentially zero for @xmath74 larger than some `` smearing radius '' @xmath75 .",
    "the kernel depends on the details of the smearing procedure .",
    "gaussian and exponential smearing @xcite is local in time and the kernel contains a delta function in the euclidean time coordinate . in contrast , the gradient flow @xcite is a truly four - dimensional smearing .",
    "what matters here are the transformation properties of the smeared quark fields . provided the kernel is diagonal in spinor space ( as it is for gaussian smearing and the gradient flow ) the smeared quark fields transform just as the unsmeared ones under parity and global chiral transformations .",
    "consequently , also the nucleon interpolating fields formed with the smeared quark fields transform according to ( [ ntrafolr ] ) and ( [ ntrafop ] ) , just as their local counterparts .",
    "since the symmetry properties of the interpolating fields essentially determine their expression in chpt we can already conclude that both local and smeared interpolating fields are mapped onto the same effective operator , differing in their values for the lecs only .",
    "we come back to this issue in section [ ssecefffields ] .    the two interpolating fields in eq .",
    "( [ defn12 ] ) were originally discussed in the context of qcd sum rule calculations , and in lattice qcd simulations the discretized version of these continuum interpolaters are used .",
    "an alternative approach for the construction of baryonic operators starts directly from the irreducible representations of the cubic group of the space - time lattice @xcite . in order to discuss this type of operators",
    "one first has to perform a mapping to the symanzik effective theory , the leading part being continuum qcd followed by corrections proportional to powers of the lattice spacing @xcite . to the lattice operators",
    "whose leading symanzik term is given by the interpolating fields in ( [ defn12 ] ) the following discussion equally applies up to corrections proportional to the lattice spacing . or @xmath69 .",

    "should be reasonably smaller than 1 . if we restrict ourselves to momenta satisfying @xmath105 we find values for @xmath106 ranging between 2 and 5 .",
    "for the coefficients @xmath107 with @xmath108 we expect the chiral expansion to be applicable .",

    "the smaller @xmath91 and @xmath109 is the better the chiral expansion behaves . for @xmath110",
    "one does not expect a fast rate of convergence , and the lo results for the coefficients @xmath111 associated with these rather high momenta will probably receive rather large higher order corrections .",

    ". the error will be smaller for the coefficients associated with the smaller momenta .",
    "note that the exponential suppression due to the exponential @xmath112 $ ] is stronger for the contributions with larger momentum , so the contributions with a larger uncertainty in the two - point function are more suppressed .",
    "another reason to constrain the momenta @xmath109 and @xmath91 stems from the requirement that the nucleon - pion - state energy should be sufficiently well separated form the first one - particle resonance energy . if that is not the case one expects large mixing between these two states that significantly alter the coefficents @xmath111 @xcite . in practice",
    ", however , this seems to be almost automatically satisfied once the momenta are constrained by the bound ( [ boundpn ] ) , because the energy of the first resonance is about 0.5gev higher than the nucleon mass .",

    "the sum over @xmath109 is truncated at @xmath106 given in table [ tab : expansion ] .",

    "even with this uncertainty we can conclude that the nucleon - pion - state contribution to the effective mass is at the few - percent level . whether this plays",
    "a role in practice depends on the statistical errors in the lattice data and the source - sink separations accessible in the simulation . for statistical errors of 1% and below",
    "the nucleon - pion - state contribution should be noticeable in the data , at least for euclidean times below @xmath121 fm .",

    "the results we find for the nucleon - pion - state contribution to the nucleon correlation function is small .",
    "whether it is too small to be seen in lattice qcd data is not easy to answer and depends on various parameters of the simulation , among others on the range for the euclidean time and the size of the statistical errors in the data .",

    "the lo results are universal for all the various nucleon interpolating fields considererd here . in order to discuss and describe differences caused by using different interpolating fields one has to go at least one order higher in the chiral expansion .    here",
    "we studied the dominant nucleon - pion - state contributions to the nucleon two - point function .",
    "the same framework can be used to study the nucleon - pion - state contribution to higher @xmath91-point functions .",
    "the nucleon axial charge , for example , is obtained from the three - point function involving the axial vector current . in that case the contamination with excited and multi - particle states is expected to be larger , because more than one euclidean time difference are present in these correlation functions , and these are usually smaller than the source - sink separation in the two - point function .",
    "preliminary results concerning the nucleon - pion - state contributions in the determination of @xmath122 can be found in @xcite .",

    "as mentioned at the end of section [ ssect : qcdinterpolaters ] non - relativistic interpolating nucleon fields can be constructed from their relativistic counterparts . here",

    "it is sufficient to discuss the local interpolating field only , the generalization to the smeared fields is completely analogous to the discussion at the end of section [ ssect : qcdinterpolaters ] .    in our discussion of the relativistic interpolating fields there was no need to specify a particular representation for the @xmath76-matrices .",
    "for the non - relativistic limit it is useful to assume the dirac representation with @xmath123 being diagonal .",
    "the reason is that in this basis the projectors @xmath124 can be used to decompose a quark spinor @xmath62 into its _",
    "upper _ ( large ) spinor component @xmath125 and its _ lower _ ( small ) spinor components @xmath126 .",
    "the latter vanish in the non - relativistic limit .",

    "let us call this part @xmath127 .",
    "this field completely breaks charge conjugation but it still transforms according to ( 2.8 ) and ( 2.9 ) under chiral transformations and parity .",
    "so this field is mapped onto the expression ( [ neffexp ] ) in the chiral effective theory but the nucleon interpolating field @xmath128 in the terms of table [ table : nop ] are replaced by @xmath129 . using this we find the expression @xmath130 for the interpolating field in the chiral effective theory .",
    "in addition to a different lec the parity projectors appear explicitly in this expression , in contrast to the result in ( [ neffexp ] ) .",

    "due to the parity projector @xmath131 in the definition of the correlator only the first term in ( [ nnreffexp ] ) contributes , the second vanishes identically . in terms of feynman diagrams this",
