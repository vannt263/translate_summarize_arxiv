    "strange quark matter ( sqm ) has been suggested as a possible stable or metastable phase of nuclear matter @xcite , which might be realized in form of small droplets ( stranglets ) or in the interior of superdense stars @xcite . applying the fermi gas model for quarks , the energy per baryon of such",
    "a system might be lower than the one of @xmath0 due to the conversion of up and down quarks into strange quarks by the weak interaction .",
    "the equation of state of this system has been described as a non - interacting gas of quarks at zero temperature , taking into account the bag constant @xcite .",
    "also quark interactions within lowest order perturbative qcd have been considered @xcite .",
    "in condensed matter as well as in nuclear physics medium effects play an important role .",
    "one of the most important medium effects are effective masses generated by the interaction of the particles with the system . in a gluon gas at high temperature",
    "the consideration of an effective mass for the gluons within the ideal gas approximation leads to an excellent description of the equation of state found in lattice calculations @xcite .    here",
    "we want to apply the idea of an ideal gas of quasiparticles with effective masses to the case of quark matter . instead of gluons at finite temperature",
    "we consider up , down , and strange quarks at zero temperature but finite chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "the aim of the present section is the derivation of an effective quark mass in an extended , dense system of quarks at zero temperature .",
    "this effective mass is defined as the zero momentum limit of the quark dispersion relation following from the poles of the effective quark propagator @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the current quark mass and @xmath4 the quark self energy .",
    "the self energy is calculated within the hard dense loop ( hdl ) approximation @xcite , where only hard momenta of the order of the quark chemical potential @xmath1 for the internal quark and gluon lines in the one - loop quark self energy are used . as in the high temperature case @xcite the vacuum contribution and the contribution from integration over soft momenta",
    "are of higher order .",
    "this approximation is equivalent to the leading term in the high density approximation analogously to the finite temperature case @xcite . in this way",
    "we arrive at a gauge invariant expression for the self energy , complete to leading order in the coupling constant @xmath5 . of course , due to the perturbative nature of this approximation , the resulting expressions are only valid for small coupling constants , corresponding to a large chemical potential @xmath1 , i.e. high density , according to asymptotic freedom .",
    "however , as shown in the case of a hot gluon gas , the equation of state using effective masses calculated perturbatively agrees very well with lattice results even at temperatures where the coupling constant is not small @xcite .    in the case of a vanishing current quark mass ,",
    "as it can be assumed for up and down quarks , the effective mass following from the hdl quark self energy is given by @xcite @xmath6    for strange quarks we adopt an effective quark mass following from the dispersion relation of massive quarks , where we used the hdl self energy assuming the current quark mass to be soft ( @xmath7 ) @xcite : @xmath8",
    "at temperature @xmath9 the particle density @xmath10 and energy density @xmath11 of a fermi gas are given by @xcite    @xmath12    @xmath13\\ ] ]    here @xmath14 denotes the degree of degeneracy ( e.g. @xmath15 for @xmath16 flavors ) .",
    "up to the additional function @xmath17 , which can be regarded as a @xmath1-dependent bag constant , these are the ideal fermi gas formulas at temperature @xmath9 for quasiparticles of mass @xmath18 and chemical potential @xmath19 . the fermi momentum is @xmath20 . due to the @xmath19-dependence of @xmath21 the functions @xmath22 are necessary to maintain thermodynamic self - consistency @xcite .",
    "in the case of @xmath23 given by ( [ defmq ] ) we found @xcite    @xmath24 \\mu_q^4 \\ , , \\ ] ]    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the equations of state ( [ defrhogeneral])-([defepsgeneral ] ) then assume the simple form    @xmath27    @xmath28    they are the well known equations for massless fermions up to the factor @xmath29 ( ) .",
    "note that @xmath30 and @xmath31 decrease with increasing coupling constant @xmath5 .    in the case of an effective strange quark mass",
    "the additional function @xmath32 assumes a more complicated form given in ref.@xcite .",
    "now we use the equations of state derived in the last section to calculate the energy per baryon of strange quark matter assuming a finite s - quark mass :      here @xmath34 denotes the bag constant .",
    "the baryon density is now given by @xmath35 .",
    "as usual @xcite we define the strangeness fraction as @xmath36 .",
    "fig.1 shows the minimum energy per baryon ( corresponding to a vanishing pressure ) over @xmath37 for various values of @xmath5 .",
    "the bag constant is assumed to be @xmath38 mev and the current s - quark mass as @xmath39 mev .",
    "one sees that @xmath40 increases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , the absolute minimum of the energy ( fig.2 ) , obtained from the optimal @xmath37 , increases for example from 874 mev ( @xmath41 ) to 943 mev ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "therefore , for the chosen parameters and realistic values of the coupling constant sqm is not bound with respect to @xmath43 . for larger @xmath44 and @xmath45 even larger values for @xmath40",
    "are obtained .",
    "furthermore , the baryon density is found to decrease with increasing @xmath5 while the energy density @xmath11 stays approximately constant @xcite .",
    "the strangeness fraction @xmath37 decreases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "it is not possible to describe the influence of medium effects just by altering the bag constant @xcite .",
    "the same observation holds for a variation of @xmath44 instead of @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , the eos of sqm has been computed including @xmath46-corrections , i.e. one - gluon exchange @xcite .",
    "increasing @xmath47 there leads to an increase of @xmath40 as in our approach .",
    "however , at the same time @xmath37 increases in contrast to our case .",
    "hence , we conclude that the influence of the effective quark masses on sqm can not be simulated by taking into account @xmath47-corrections or changing @xmath34 or @xmath44 .    concluding , our investigations suggest that sqm is not absolute stable if medium effects are taken into account . however , it might still be metastable , i.e. stable against decays caused by the strong interaction , which might have interesting consequences for the formation of strangelets in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .    finally ,",
    "applying our results to strange quark stars , we observe @xcite that the radius - mass relation of these stars is hardly changed by the presence of an effective quark mass since the pressure as function of the energy density , entering into the oppenheimer - volkoff - tolman equations , depends only very weakly on it . however , owing to the increase of @xmath40 in the entire star a phase transition to hadronic matter will take place at a smaller radius in the interior of the star ."
