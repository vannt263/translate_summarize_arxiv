    "an accurate description of the evolution of matter in a fully dynamical spacetime in complete generality is a longstanding and still unresolved problem in numerical relativistic astrophysics . with many important problems in urgent need of study , such as multidimensional core collapse , neutron star collisions or black hole formation",
    ", this outstanding problem represents a major gap in our ability to understand some of the most highly energetic processes in relativistic astrophysics .",
    "numerous attempts have been made to develop such capabilities over the years , but only the spherical case can be considered essentially solved  @xcite , and even there it has not yet been widely applied . in higher dimensions ,",
    "most of the studies have been restricted to the axisymmetric two dimensional ( 2d ) case , and there much of the work has been devoted to hydrodynamical integrations on _ fixed _ general relativistic backgrounds@xcite . even in axisymmetry",
    ", only a few attempts have been made to consider a fully self - gravitating , dynamic background  @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional case is also being studied , but the number of fully relativistic simulations is even smaller , with only a handful of fixed background hydrodynamical codes  @xcite and fully self - gravitating codes  @xcite developed to date . in view of the difficulty of a fully relativistic treatment , approximations to a complete general relativistic approach",
    "are also being developed recently  @xcite .",
    "the reasons for the reduced number of multidimensional ( 2d and 3d ) computations are diverse , but we can enumerate the two most obvious ones : first , the inherent difficulties and complexities of the system of equations to integrate , the einstein field equations coupled to the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations , which make this computation one of the most challenging ones in physics .",
    "second , the immense computational resources needed to integrate the equations for 3d evolutions were not available in the past and are only starting to be achieved at present",
    ".      in the axisymmetric case there exist a number of interesting astrophysical applications that can be addressed numerically , such as the rotational collapse of stellar cores in the supernova explosion scenario , the implosion of matter shells onto a black hole , the dynamics and stability of accretion disks or the fully dynamical spacetime version of the so - called relativistic bondi - hoyle accretion onto a moving black hole .",
    "some of these problems have already tentatively been studied in the past within the framework of general relativity ( see references below ) although many scenarios still await for first ( and detailed ) computations . in this paper",
    "we take some early steps on that direction focusing on the methodology we will be using in the future for the study of those systems .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned scenarios , one of the most interesting systems to consider is the head - on collision of a neutron star with a black hole .",
    "the correct understanding of this simplified head - on model will undoubtedly serve as an important testbed for future three - dimensional codes .",
    "hence , it is an important step that will aid in development of simulations of more complex scenarios , such as the coalescence and merging of spiral compact binaries .",
    "these catastrophic events are believed to be among the most promising sources of gravitational radiation to be detected by the gravitational wave interferometers to be operating around the turn of the century ( ligo , virgo , tama , geo600 ) .",
    "the use of general relativistic axisymmetric codes in numerical relativity has been largely devoted to the study of the gravitational collapse and bounce of a rotating stellar core and the subsequent emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "these investigations started with the work of nakamura  @xcite , who was the first to calculate a general relativistic rotating stellar collapse . in his calculation",
    ", he was able to track the evolution of matter and the formation of a black hole but the scheme was not accurate enough to compute the emitted gravitational radiation .",
    "later , stark and piran  @xcite revisited this problem studying the collapse of rotating relativistic polytropic stars to black holes and succeeded in computing the gravitational radiation emission .",
    "their code used the radial gauge and a mixture of polar and maximal slicing .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations were solved with standard finite difference methods with artificial viscosity  @xcite .",
    "evans  @xcite also studied the gravitational collapse problem but for non - rotating matter configurations .",
    "his numerical scheme to treat the matter fields was more sophisticated than previous approaches as it included monotonic upwind reconstruction procedures and flux limiters .",
    "evans  @xcite was able to show that newtonian gravity and the quadrupole formula for gravitational radiation were inadequate to study the problem .",
    "more recently , abrahams et al .",
    "@xcite have solved the einstein equations numerically for rotating spacetimes where the source of the gravitational field is a configuration of collisionless ( dust ) particles .",
    "they used the code to evaluate the stability of polytropic and toroidal star clusters . because they did not have to take pressure forces into account",
    ", they could reduce the hydrodynamic computation to a straightforward integration of the geodesic equations .",
    "on the other hand , a few groups have concentrated on building codes to handle dynamical , axisymmetric gravitational fields in vacuum , without the complications of the matter fields .",
    "these have been applied notably to the collapse of gravitational waves to form a black hole  @xcite and to the evolution of distorted , rotating , and colliding black holes  @xcite .",
    "but , even without the presence of matter fields , these calculations have proven very difficult for a number of reasons , not the least of which are the choice of appropriate gauge conditions and the presence of numerical instabilities encountered near the axis of symmetry .",
    "these are among the reasons that work in this area has been fairly limited .",
    "we have embarked on a program to develop a series of fully relativistic codes to solve the coupled set of equations in multiple dimensions .",
    "this work builds on some years of experience in dynamic vacuum relativity ( see , for example  @xcite ) and in fixed background general relativistic hydrodynamics ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "in spherical symmetry , we have developed a code@xcite exploiting advances in hyperbolic treatments of both general relativistic hydrodynamics  @xcite and the einstein equations themselves  @xcite . in the 3d case ,",
    "a code is under development specifically for the study of neutron star collisions  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we report first results obtained with a 2d axisymmetric numerical code designed to evolve rotating black hole spacetimes with self - gravitating matter .",
    "we believe that this code can have a number of interesting applications in the numerical modeling of accretion processes in black hole astrophysics .",
    "in addition , it will provide important testbeds for fully 3d codes now under development .",
    "this axisymmetric code is the result of the _ coupling _ of two previously developed production codes : an advanced general relativistic hydrodynamical code for stationary spacetimes and an axisymmetric black hole code to solve the dynamic einstein field equations in vacuum .",
    "the integration of the different variables , spacetime and hydrodynamical quantities , is , hence , performed with a unique code .",
    "the two basic building blocks of the new code are extensively described in previous work  @xcite .",
    "the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics are integrated with a modern _ high - resolution shock - capturing _ numerical scheme which relies on the knowledge of the characteristic information of the system of equations in order to build up a _",
    "riemann solver_. these equations have been recently written as a hyperbolic system of conservation laws ( with sources ) for a general @xmath0 metric  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic information of the system has been explicitly obtained .",
    "the jacobian matrices are found to have real eigenvalues and a complete set of right - eigenvectors , therefore satisfying the definition of hyperbolicity  @xcite .",
    "the use of these methods , also referred to as godunov - type methods ( after the seminal idea by godunov  @xcite ) is becoming more important in recent years , due to a number of nice properties that other finite difference methods do not share ( e.g. , artificial viscosity methods ) .",
    "those include a consistent treatment of discontinuous solutions ( shock - capturing property ) combined with being high - order methods in regions where the numerical solution is smooth .",
    "recently , the use of these methods in relativistic hydrodynamics has permitted , for the first time , an accurate description of ultrarelativistic flows in different astrophysical scenarios ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite,@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the black hole piece of the code was originally developed by brandt and seidel  @xcite and is based on the standard arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm )  @xcite formulation of the einstein equations as an initial value ( or cauchy ) problem .",
    "the metric and extrinsic curvature components are evolved for the full set of the einstein equations using a @xmath0 explicit second order runge - kutta scheme with centered differencing .",
    "this code has a black hole built into the initial hypersurface of the spacetime .",
    "this avoids possible coordinate problems at the origin of the spherical coordinate system , since the black hole is constructed with an _ isometry _ that maps its interior , which contains a singularity at the origin , to the exterior , across a sphere at a finite radius .",
    "hence , no reference need be made to the origin ( as discussed in more detail below ) .",
    "this code can evolve a variety of spacetimes including rotating , distorted black holes .",
    "it also has a number of utilities built - in , such as routines to extract the various gravitational radiation modes and to track the motion of apparent and event horizons .",
    "the effective coupling of the two systems is through the source terms of the einstein field equations .",
    "this allows us to integrate the whole system in a straightforward way  the metric and matter codes can simply take turns updating the variables .",
    "first , the hydrodynamical code takes a step , treating the spacetime metric as fixed and then the black hole code takes a step treating the matter fields as fixed .",
    "we regard this coupling of two mature codes as a starting point for algorithm development and forthcoming work in numerical relativistic astrophysics that will be explored in the near future .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section  [ preliminaries ] we briefly review the adm formulation of the spacetime , discuss our particular choice of spacetime and hydrodynamical variables and describe the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "the initial value ( cauchy ) problem with the presence of matter fields is discussed in section  [ initdat ] .",
    "we describe the details of the numerical code in section  [ code ] , where we address the specific issues concerning the coupling of the hydrodynamic equations and einstein equations , as well as the gauge conditions used .",
    "results and convergence tests of the simulations are presented in section  [ results ] .",
    "these include the spherical ( bondi ) accretion of matter and the implosion ( accretion ) of a dust shell with the black hole . in the latter case",
    ", we also extract the waveforms of the gravitational waves induced by the presence of matter .",
    "although in the present paper we mainly focus on the non - rotating case we will also present some results for rotating black hole spacetimes at the end of section  [ results ] . finally , section  [ conclusions ] summarizes our main conclusions and outlines future directions of this work .",
    "we use the standard adm  @xcite formulation of the einstein equations as the basis for our numerical code .",
    "pertinent details of the formalism are summarized here , but we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a general treatment .",
    "a separate description of the theoretical details of both parts of the code can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "although for the sake of completeness we outline the most important points here , we refer the interested reader to these references as they will be extensively used throughout the present paper .    in the adm formulation",
    ", spacetime is foliated into a set of non - intersecting spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "there are two kinematic variables which describe the evolution between these surfaces : the lapse function @xmath1 , which describes the rate of advance of time along a timelike unit vector @xmath2 normal to a surface , and the spacelike shift vector @xmath3 that describes the motion of coordinates within a surface ( throughout the paper greek ( latin ) indices run from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ( @xmath6 to @xmath5 ) ) .",
    "the choice of the lapse function and shift vector is essentially arbitrary ( i.e. , four degrees of freedom embodying the coordinate freedom of general relativity ) , and our choices will be described in section  [ gauge ] below .",
    "the line element is written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the 3metric induced on each spacelike slice .",
    "given a choice of lapse @xmath1 and shift vector @xmath9 , the einstein equations in the @xmath0 formalism split into evolution equations for the 3metric @xmath8 and constraint equations that must be satisfied on any time slice .",
    "the evolution equations are @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the extrinsic curvature of the 3dimensional time slice , @xmath12 is the ricci tensor of the induced 3metric and @xmath13 is the covariant three - space derivative . the matter terms involving @xmath14 and @xmath15 are defined below .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint equation is @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the ricci scalar .",
    "the three momentum constraint equations are @xmath18    in the above equations , the quantities @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath15 , the spatial components of the stress - energy tensor , the momenta and the total energy , respectively , are obtained by projecting the four stress - energy tensor using @xmath21 , the normal to the slice : @xmath22    note that latin indices are raised and lowered with the induced 3metric , e.g. , @xmath23 , @xmath24 . as we discuss in section  [ initdat ] , the constraint equations are used to obtain the initial data , and the evolution equations are used to advance the solution in time .      the matter fields appearing in the constraint and extrinsic curvature equations are computed via the local conservation laws of baryon number and energy - momentum , @xmath25 @xmath26    the rest - mass current and the perfect fluid stress - energy tensor of eqs .",
    "( [ j ] ) and  ( [ t ] ) have the following definitions @xmath27 and @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the rest - mass density , @xmath30 is the pressure , @xmath31 is the four - velocity of the fluid and @xmath32 is the specific enthalpy , defined by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the specific internal energy .",
    "the spatial part of the fluid velocity is defined according to @xmath35 such that @xmath36 .",
    "given this condition , it follows that @xmath37 is the lorentz factor , @xmath38 and @xmath39 in ref .",
    "@xcite the general relativistic hydrodynamical equations are written , explicitly , as a hyperbolic system of balance laws in the framework of the adm formulation .",
    "starting from eqs .",
    "( [ j ] ) and ( [ t ] ) and choosing an appropriate basis vectors for the spacetime @xmath40 , adapted to the eulerian observers it is possible to cast the conservation equations into a more useful form  @xcite : @xmath41 = \\left[0 , t^{\\mu\\nu } \\nabla_\\mu e^{(i)}_\\nu , t^{\\mu\\nu } \\nabla_\\mu n_\\nu \\right]\\ ] ] we can adopt a more compact notation as follows : @xmath42\\\\ { \\bf s } & = & \\left[0 , t^{\\mu\\nu } \\nabla_\\mu e^{(i)}_\\nu , t^{\\mu\\nu } \\nabla_\\mu n_\\nu \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , this may be written in flux form by defining @xmath43 giving us @xmath44 in the above equation @xmath45 stands for the determinant of the 3-metric and @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the matter variables that are actually evolved in time are @xmath47 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\left [ j^\\mu n_\\mu , -\\perp^i{}_\\nu t^{\\nu\\mu } n_\\mu , t^{\\mu\\nu } n_\\mu n_\\nu - j^\\mu n_\\mu \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\left [ \\rho w , \\rho h w^2 v^i,\\rho h w^2-\\rho w - p \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for numerical applications we give the equations the form of a _",
    "canonical _ balance law .",
    "hence , we move quantities related to the spacetime metric to the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath48 with @xmath49      let us here introduce the notation for the spacetime variables , writing down the particular expressions used in axisymmetry from the general case considered in section iia .",
    "explicit details about this axisymmetric coordinate choice can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the metric variables are given by :    @xmath50    and @xmath51    in these expressions @xmath52 is a logarithmic radial coordinate , and ( @xmath53,@xmath54 ) are the usual spherical angular coordinates .",
    "the relation between @xmath52 and the standard radial coordinates used for schwarzschild and kerr black holes is given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath58 its angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath59 a generalization of the schwarzschild isotropic radius and @xmath60 is the usual boyer - lindquist radial coordinate .",
    "this logarithmic coordinate allows one to impose outer boundary conditions at very large values of the standard radial coordinate .",
    "the conformal factor @xmath61 is determined on the initial slice , as explained in section [ initdat ] below . since we do not use it as a dynamical variable , it remains fixed in time afterwards .      conceptually , the computational domain consists of the region between two nested spheres , the throat of a black hole and a constant radius that is very far away ( several hundred adm masses ) . at the throat",
    "there is an _",
    "isometry _ condition , which says that all variables ( the metric and gauge variables , the matter fields , etc ) at the interior of the throat can be calculated from their exterior values .    across the throat of the black hole , labeled by @xmath62",
    ", we can demand the condition that the spacetime has the same geometry for positive @xmath52 as for negative @xmath52 .",
    "this condition will build a wormhole into our spacetime .",
    "if we formulate the symmetry correctly , we will obtain simple boundary conditions for the throat that apply not only initially , but throughout the evolution .",
    "this boundary condition may be stated in one of two ways ( in axisymmetry ) to allow for different slicing conditions .",
    "each choice must result in a symmetric @xmath63 and an anti - symmetric @xmath64 to be consistent with the kerr solution .",
    "thus , the form of the isometry condition must be different for spacetimes sliced with a symmetric or an anti - symmetric lapse .",
    "for an anti - symmetric lapse the condition is @xmath65 while for a symmetric lapse the condition reads @xmath66 .",
    "if a lapse that is anti - symmetric across the throat is desired , the metric elements with a single @xmath52 index are anti - symmetric across the throat , while those with zero or two indices are symmetric .",
    "the extrinsic curvature components have the opposite symmetry of their corresponding metric elements .",
    "the shift @xmath67 is anti - symmetric across the throat , while all other shifts are symmetric .",
    "the scalar matter fields , e.g. , density or pressure , are simply symmetric across the throat , producing the same value at @xmath68 as at @xmath69 .",
    "the momentum fields , @xmath20 are proportional to the shift divided by the lapse ( @xmath70 ) and therefore have the same symmetry as this quantity",
    ".    if a symmetric lapse is desired , the metric elements with a single @xmath52 index or single @xmath54 index ( but not both ) will be anti - symmetric at the throat and all others will be symmetric .",
    "the extrinsic curvature components will have the same symmetries as their corresponding metric elements .",
    "the @xmath67 and @xmath71 shifts will be anti - symmetric , and the @xmath72 shift will be symmetric .",
    "with these symmetries enforced , the initial data and all subsequent time slices will be isometric across the throat .",
    "one can verify that all einstein equations respect these symmetries during the evolution if they are satisfied initially .    in the @xmath53-direction we can either evolve the whole region from @xmath73 to @xmath74 or we can use an equatorial plane symmetry to increase the effective resolution of our simulation .",
    "all metric elements , extrinsic curvature components , shift components , and the @xmath20 momentum components , with a single @xmath53 index are anti - symmetric across the symmetry axis .",
    "the remainder fields are symmetric .",
    "if we are not using an equatorial plane symmetry this condition applies both at the axis @xmath73 and at @xmath74 .    at the equator ( @xmath75 )",
    "there are two possible symmetries , the kerr symmetry and the `` cosmic screw '' symmetry . for the kerr symmetry , @xmath76 , all metric components , extrinsic curvature components or shifts with a single @xmath53 index are anti - symmetric .",
    "the remainder fields are symmetric . for the cosmic - screw type boundary conditions the symmetry at the equator is @xmath77 and those metric elements , extrinsic curvature components , or shift components that contain one @xmath53 or one @xmath54 index ( but not both ) are anti - symmetric .",
    "the remainder are symmetric .",
    "finally , at the outer boundary a robin condition is used for @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "this condition gives the correct asymptotic behavior in the conformal factor to order @xmath78 .",
    "for the metric given in the form ( [ threemetric ] ) @xmath61 has the form @xmath79 and therefore obeys the differential equation @xmath80 .",
    "the conformal factor is always symmetric at the throat , axis , and equator .      following ref .",
    "@xcite , we will utilize the gauge freedom provided by the shift vector to reduce the number of spacetime variables that are evolved .",
    "two of the shift components are used to eliminate the off - diagonal metric variable @xmath81 and one shift component is used to eliminate the off - diagonal metric element@xmath82 .",
    "we note that this leaves one degree of gauge freedom unexploited .",
    "also , due to the presence of both even- and odd - parity gravitational wave modes ( or in other language , the `` plus '' and `` cross '' modes ) , the metric can not be made completely diagonal .",
    "the @xmath83 component @xmath84 carries information about the odd - parity wave modes that must be accounted for when rotational effects are included .    as for the lapse choice",
    ", the code uses the time honored maximal slicing  @xcite(that is , one of most commonly used slicing conditions in evolutions of black holes to date ) .",
    "the singularity avoiding properties of this slicing are characterized by the appearance of a limit surface at a distance from the black hole singularity that is dependent on the angular momentum  @xcite , and , to a minor extent , on the form of gravity waves contained within the spacetime  @xcite .",
    "maximal slicing is derived from the freely imposable condition that the trace of the extrinsic curvature should vanish throughout the evolution .",
    "we note that the kerr solution in standard form is already maximally sliced with antisymmetric lapse , i.e. one which has the negative isometry sign across the isometry surface going into the black hole . setting tr@xmath85 in the evolution for tr@xmath86",
    "gives @xmath87 this elliptic equation is solved numerically on each time slice during the evolution using a multigrid solver .",
    "this elliptic equation solver  @xcite is a semi - coarsening multigrid solver which does tridiagonal solves along the radial direction .",
    "it has proved quite robust and reliable in our numerical work to date .",
    "for the purposes of our numerical evolution , the previous considerations leave the metric variables @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath84 , and all six @xmath91 s as dynamical variables to be evolved .",
    "the various factors of sin@xmath53 are included in the definitions to explicitly account for some of the behavior of the metric variables near the axis of symmetry and the equator .",
    "the condition on the shift used in our evolutions is , as in previous work on vacuum black hole spacetimes , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this choice simplifies the numerical equations and stabilizes the code .",
    "since the kerr shift allows the stationary rotating black hole metric to be manifestly time independent , one expects that for the dynamical case a similar shift will be helpful , and our procedure recovers the kerr shift given the kerr lapse , metric , and extrinsic curvature .",
    "we construct the shift condition by means of the evolution equations for the two metric variables we are setting to zero .",
    "let us now consider how to implement the condition @xmath92 , @xmath93  or , in terms of our variables , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the relevant metric evolution equations are :    @xmath96     + these equations can be combined to produce a single equation involving @xmath97 and @xmath98 : @xmath99    we can solve this equation by introducing an auxiliary function @xmath100 through the definitions :    @xmath101    [ defshift ]     + ( following ref .",
    "@xcite ) , producing an elliptic equation for the function @xmath100 : @xmath102 this equation is then solved by finite differencing using a numerical elliptic equation solver . the solution @xmath100 is then differentiated by centered derivatives to recover the shift components @xmath67 and @xmath72 according to eqs .  ( [ defshift ] )",
    "in practice , these shifts remain fairly small during the evolution .",
    "their main function is to suppress the axis instability , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite where a similar shift was used .",
    "once @xmath100 is known , @xmath71 can be calculated by integrating eq .",
    "( [ evohe ] ) : @xmath103 only one boundary condition needs to be set ( the outer boundary condition is most convenient ) , and it is generally set equal to the kerr value . the inner boundary condition , that @xmath71 must be symmetric across the throat , is guaranteed by eq .",
    "( [ evohe ] ) .",
    "this shift component is needed to keep the coordinates from becoming `` tangled up '' as they are dragged around by the rotating hole .",
    "without such a shift the coordinates would rotate , leading to metric shear  @xcite .",
    "this shift component , @xmath71 , is typically larger than @xmath67 or @xmath72 .      within the axisymmetric coordinate system defined before , the adm mass and angular momentum about the @xmath104-axis",
    "are defined to be  @xcite    @xmath105     + in terms of the variables defined in this paper these expressions yield    @xmath106     + because of this , the variable @xmath107 is extremely important .",
    "it determines whether or not angular momentum is present in the spacetime .",
    "although the adm mass is defined strictly only at spatial infinity @xmath108 , in practice we evaluate it at the edge of the spatial grid . as we use a logarithmic radial coordinate @xmath52 ,",
    "this is in the asymptotic regime . while the angular momentum is , in principle ,",
    "also measured at @xmath108 , the presence of the azimuthal killing vector makes it possible to evaluate @xmath109 at any radius .",
    "however , unlike the vacuum case , the presence of matter does make it possible to transfer angular momentum through the motion of matter if there is angular momentum present in the matter initially . in all simulations in this paper , however , the angular momentum of the matter field is initially zero ( i.e. @xmath110 by choice ; note that this does _ not _ mean that @xmath111 is zero , because that may include rotation of the coordinates ) .",
    "therefore we expect that integration at any radius will yield @xmath109 .",
    "we monitor this quantity during our simulations and use it as a test of the accuracy of our code .",
    "because the einstein equations require initial values of the metric and extrinsic curvature which satisfy constraints ( see eqs .",
    "( [ hamconstrnt ] ) and ( [ momconstrnt ] ) ) , and because these constraints consist of four coupled non - linear partial differential equations , obtaining a good starting point for an evolution requires a special technique  a conformal decomposition of the hydrodynamic and spacetime variables .",
    "the basics of this conformal decomposition of the initial data problem was first given by lichnerowicz  @xcite and later elaborated by bowen and york  @xcite .",
    "essentially , if one makes the following ansatz    @xmath112     + and if a trace - free extrinsic curvature is used , then the hamiltonian constraint decouples from the momentum constraints , greatly simplifying the problem .",
    "next , one normally assumes a form for the conformal metric , typically that it is flat , and then constructs a solution to the extrinsic curvature .",
    "since this amounts to solving three equations for six unknowns it is customary to decompose the extrinsic curvature into a vector potential , @xmath113 , ( see  @xcite ) thereby reducing the number of unknowns to three : @xmath114 standard solutions to this equation with appropriate asymptotic behavior for linear or angular momentum have been obtained .",
    "see  @xcite where solutions for single boosted or rotating black holes are described .",
    "another simple solution to the momentum constraints can be found by simply inventing a form for @xmath115 , plugging it into the extrinsic curvature solution and then solving for the matter current term @xmath116    because the momentum constraint equations are linear in @xmath117 it is possible to combine them with the matter current solution obtained by inventing a @xmath115 simply by adding them together .",
    "one can add the form of the extrinsic curvature for a rotating black hole to the simple method described above , for example , to obtain a solution for initially flowing matter surrounding a rotating black hole .",
    "at this point we have nearly solved the problem .",
    "we have only two quantities left to determine : the conformal factor @xmath61 and the conformal mass energy density @xmath118 .",
    "we shall consider @xmath118 first .",
    "our primary consideration in choosing @xmath118 will be to avoid unrealistic configurations of matter , i.e. , matter which does not obey the energy condition @xmath119 and secondarily to find a solution which has matter flowing with a certain desired speed and along a chosen direction .    for dust ,",
    "the total velocity of the system can be calculated ( thanks to the choice of the conformal factor made above ) by the formula , @xmath120 this is guaranteed to be less than one if we specify the conformal energy density in the following manner : @xmath121 here @xmath122 is an arbitrarily chosen function that respects the boundary conditions of our problem , and is everywhere greater than zero .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath122 the slower the matter will move .",
    "the situation is slightly different for the case of a perfect fluid . in this case",
    "we can not know the precise value of the velocity until we have completely solved the problem . at this point",
    "the only unsolved quantity that remains is the conformal factor , @xmath61 , and the only unsolved equation is the hamiltonian constraint",
    ". we will solve the hamiltonian constraint ( a non - linear elliptic equation ) for the conformal factor numerically using the multigrid solver mentioned above .",
    "once this is done we can use eq .",
    "( [ deftse ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ trhoup ] ) to obtain the following relations : @xmath123 we can then solve numerically these equations for @xmath29 and @xmath37 assuming a polytropic equation of state ( i.e. , constant spatial entropy condition ) @xmath124 with @xmath125 being the ( constant ) adiabatic index of the fluid .",
    "it is assured by eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) that if a solution is found , @xmath126 as in the case of dust considered above .",
    "now we turn to the description of the numerical code with which we solve the coupled set of equations presented in section  [ preliminaries ] .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , this code is the result of the merging of two previously existing independent codes . each of these two matching pieces",
    "was originally developed to solve only one part of the problem .",
    "the final _ merged _ code is therefore capable of evolving either a vacuum spacetime , matter flows in a fixed background or a fully dynamic spacetime with evolving matter fields . due to the adm formulation of the einstein equations , which we are adopting here for our numerical evolutions ,",
    "the equations are a mixture of hyperbolic and elliptic equations . in consequence",
    ", it is not possible to write the full system as a single , unique system .",
    "hence , the code evolves both fields in an alternate , almost independent , way .",
    "however , as we shall show below , we can still get second order convergence to the real solution using this approach . on the other hand ,",
    "the alternate integration in time of both systems of equations allows one to use different numerical techniques for each one of them , choosing the best method for each piece .",
    "this is in fact what we do as we will explain later in this section .",
    "as stated previously , the hydrodynamical piece of the code makes use of a state - of - the - art modern high - resolution shock - capturing scheme .",
    "these methods are able to handle discontinuous solutions ( e.g. , shock waves ) that could , eventually , develop in the flow , without using artificial viscosity to damp post - shock oscillations . to this aim",
    "they rely on the so - called _ approximate riemann solvers_. the code is capable of using either roe s  @xcite or marquina s  @xcite methods . in addition , the code can employ one of several different cell - reconstruction algorithms to increase the spatial accuracy of the hydrodynamic evolutions .",
    "mathematically , these numerical schemes are built upon the characteristic information of the general relativistic hydrodynamics equations .",
    "hence , the equations have to be written , explicitly , as a hyperbolic system of balance laws ( as eqs .",
    "( [ f ] ) or  ( [ hydrosystem ] ) ) .    in the hydrodynamic integration of eq .",
    "( [ hydrosystem ] ) the solution is updated in time , from time @xmath127 to time @xmath128 , according to the following canonical conservative algorithm ( written in 1d for simplicity ) @xmath129 where index @xmath130 indicates cell centers and indices @xmath131 indicate cell interfaces .",
    "in particular , and in order to increase the temporal order of the scheme , a high - order ( typically second or third ) monotonicity preserving runge - kutta method  @xcite is used to update the solution in time . for a third - order scheme",
    "the algorithm looks like this :    @xmath132     + with @xmath133    a monotonic linear reconstruction of the cell centered values of the primitive variables provides second - order accuracy in space  @xcite .",
    "finally , the _ numerical fluxes _ across interfaces , @xmath134 , are calculated , in the frame of the local characteristic approach , according to @xmath135    where @xmath136 and @xmath137 represent the values of the _ primitive variables _ at the left and right sides , respectively , of the corresponding interface .",
    "this state vector is defined as @xmath138 .",
    "in addition , @xmath139 are , respectively , the eigenvalues and right - eigenvectors of the jacobian matrix of the system calculated at the interfaces from @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "explicit general expressions can be found in  @xcite .",
    "finally , the quantities @xmath140 , the jumps of the characteristic variables across each characteristic field , are obtained from @xmath141 the tilde in some of the previous quantities indicates averaged quantities at the cell interfaces , algebraically computed from @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "further information can be obtained in  @xcite and  @xcite .    for the spacetime part of the code we do not use a shock - capturing scheme . in our studies",
    "to date the metric variables are generally smooth so this presents no problem .",
    "however , in principle , any hydrodynamical shock can affect the spacetime part in terms containing first ( time ) derivatives of the extrinsic curvature components , as shown by eq .",
    "( [ excurv ] ) .",
    "hence , a shock - capturing scheme could still be a good choice .",
    "in addition , due to the slicing conditions and as an attempt to avoid any singularity appearing on the spacetime , the metric quantities can ( and in fact do ) develop large gradients ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in practice , these closely resemble the steep ones which characterize any real hydrodynamical shock .",
    "the use of shock - capturing schemes for the spacetime is , however , restricted to the recently developed hyperbolic formulations of the einstein equations ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we are also presently exploring the use of such advanced methods on the fully coupled equations in hyperbolic form  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the spacetime variables are evolved for the full set of einstein equations using an explicit second order runge - kutta scheme .",
    "schematically the evolution looks like this :    @xmath142    spatial derivatives needed in the above equations are calculated using centered , second order finite differencing .",
    "this is a different scheme than we have employed in the past  @xcite .",
    "we switched the procedure in order to simplify the alignment of time levels .",
    "this different evolution procedure has proved to be as stable and reliable in our simulations as our previous scheme .",
    "now we discuss the use of several tools we have developed to extract the physics from a fully relativistic simulation of dynamic spacetimes involving black holes . unlike the standard cases involving hydrodynamics , where density , pressure and fluid velocities have well defined meanings , in a dynamic spacetime , the metric functions themselves , which are the functions actually evolved , do not carry direct physical or geometric meaning .",
    "rather , they are related to the coordinate system and gauge in which the simulations are carried out .",
    "therefore , physically relevant information about important quantities such as gravitational radiation or the mass of the black hole must be derived from the metric functions .",
    "the gravitational radiation emitted is one of the most important quantities of interest in many astrophysical processes .",
    "however , the radiation is generated in regions of strong and dynamic gravitational fields , and then propagated to regions far away where it can be detected .",
    "we take the approach of computing the evolution of the fields in a fully nonlinear way , while analyzing the radiation emitted in the regions where the system can be considered as a perturbation propagating on a fixed background .    under these conditions",
    ", one can appeal to the well developed theory of black hole perturbations . in this case one",
    "identifies certain perturbed metric quantities that evolve according to wave equations on the black hole background .",
    "however , the perturbed metric functions are also dependent of the gauge in which they are computed .",
    "fortunately , there is a _ gauge - invariant _ prescription for isolating wave modes on black hole backgrounds , developed first by moncrief  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that although the first order perturbed metric functions transform under first order coordinate transformations ( gauge transformations ) , one can identify certain linear combinations of these functions that are invariant under such transformations .",
    "these gauge - invariant functions are clearly more directly related to true physics ( which does not depend on coordinate systems ) , and in fact these functions obey the wave equations describing gravitational wave modes in linear theory .",
    "there are two independent wave modes , even- and odd - parity , corresponding to the two degrees of freedom , or polarization modes , of the waves .",
    "the metric used in this work allows both modes , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ gauge ] above .    in principle",
    ", one can consider a full set of gauge - invariants including both matter and gravitational wave fields , but our interest here is in evolving the hydrodynamics and spacetime within the fully nonlinear theory , and simply extracting the gravitational wave information assuming a vacuum region away from the black hole .",
    "a waveform extraction procedure has been developed that allows one to process the metric and to identify the wave modes .",
    "the gravitational wave function ( often called the `` zerilli function '' for even - parity or the `` regge - wheeler function '' for odd - parity ) can be computed by writing the metric as the sum of a background black hole part and a perturbation : @xmath143 , where the perturbation @xmath144 is expanded in spherical harmonics and their tensor generalizations . to compute the elements of @xmath144 in a numerical simulation ,",
    "one integrates the numerically evolved metric components @xmath145 against appropriate spherical harmonics over a coordinate 2sphere surrounding the black hole .",
    "the resulting functions can then be combined in a gauge - invariant way , following the prescription given by moncrief@xcite , leading to the gravitational wave functions denoted by @xmath146 .",
    "then for each @xmath147 mode , one can extract the waveforms of gravitational waves as they pass a `` detector '' at some fixed radius .",
    "this procedure has been described in detail for the case in this paper in  @xcite , and more generally in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now turn to the topic of black hole horizons in numerical relativity and their application to the spacetimes considered in this paper .",
    "horizons can be used in various ways to analyze the physics of a black hole system , and also as a check on the accuracy of the spacetime .",
    "we briefly discuss these issues below , and then apply horizon finders in testbed simulations below .",
    "there are two definitions of black hole horizons of interest to us : ( a ) the _ event _ horizon ( eh ) is the most commonly encountered term , defined loosely as the ( closed , 2d ) surface that separates those light rays that can escape the black hole s gravitational pull from those light rays that can not .",
    "exactly on this critical surface are light rays that never fall in to the black hole , and never escape to infinity .",
    "this surface is impossible to find on a given time slice , as photons that appear to be propagating ( expanding ) away from the black hole at one time may later find themselves falling back into the black hole if more mass - energy falls in , increasing its gravitational pull .",
    "thus , the eh is generally an expanding surface composed of photons that will eventually find themselves trapped .",
    "hence , locating the _ event _ horizon requires an entire evolution of a black hole spacetime .",
    "methods do exist for finding event horizons  @xcite and can be applied to spacetimes like those considered here , but we shall employ that application in future work .",
    "( b ) the _ apparent _ horizon ( ah ) is defined loosely as the ( outermost , closed , 2d ) surface on which all outgoing photons normal to the surface are not _ instantaneously _ expanding away or converging towards each other : they have zero expansion . in stationary black hole systems , where no mass - energy will fall into the black hole ,",
    "the ah and eh coincide , but generally the ah lies inside the eh .",
    "it is a convenient surface to locate on a given time slice , since one only needs to find a closed surface such that the expansion of all outgoing photon bundles have zero expansion .",
    "the expansion @xmath148 of a congruence of null rays moving in the outward normal direction to a closed surface can be shown to be  @xcite @xmath149 where @xmath13 is the covariant derivative associated with the 3-metric @xmath8 , @xmath150 is the normal vector to the surface , @xmath11 is the extrinsic curvature of the time slice , and @xmath151 is its trace .",
    "an ah is then the outermost surface such that @xmath152 this equation is not affected by the presence of matter , since it is purely geometric in nature , and so we can use standard horizon finders without modification for our current non - vacuum spacetimes .",
    "the key is to find a surface with normal vector @xmath150 satisfying this equation .",
    "there are many methods designed by now to locate apparent horizons in 2d , and we shall use the horizon finder developed for the black hole code used in this work , described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to those papers for details of the algorithm . in those references",
    "it was shown how one can use the dynamics and geometry of the ah surface to study the physics of dynamic , rotating vacuum black hole spacetimes .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , the most important physical quantity to be used is the area @xmath88 of the apparent horizon . from this",
    "we compute an effective mass @xmath153 of the black hole , defined in axisymmetry  @xcite by @xmath154 we know that as the black hole approaches a stationary state at late times , the apparent and event horizons will coincide , and in that case the mass of the black hole is rigorously defined by the above formula .",
    "one can use this black hole mass to study energy accounting : the total adm mass of the spacetime , defined by eq .",
    "( [ admmass ] ) above , should be equal to the final black hole mass plus any mass energy carried away by gravitational waves to infinity .",
    "this gives a powerful check on the overall global accuracy and consistency of the code , testing several crucial and independent aspects of the code and physics extraction models .",
    "these were very powerful tests in the vacuum case  @xcite .",
    "we shall apply such tests below and show to what extent they are useful in these spacetimes with matter flows onto black holes .",
    "in this section we present a summary of consistency checks and testbed computations that the code has successfully passed .",
    "we have first verified that the code reproduces previous results when either the matter fields are set to zero , or the evolution of the spacetime is turned off .",
    "we start by describing convergence tests of the code , for some particular initial matter configurations , to see the order of the method .",
    "this is a necessary requirement as no exact solutions to compare with exist .",
    "we then move on to consider simulations of the spherical accretion of dust and perfect fluid matter onto a dynamic black hole . in this application",
    "we show the differences between integrating the hydrodynamical equations fully coupled to the spacetime or in the simplified case of a sliced spacetime which does not react to the presence of matter .",
    "as expected , for sufficiently low energy density initial distributions , the spacetime evolution is totally unaffected by the matter content .",
    "finally , we explore a few axisymmetric spacetimes and make some preliminary explorations of matter accreting onto both rotating and nonrotating black holes .",
    "we have performed a series of convergence tests on our code .",
    "we measure convergence along the line @xmath155 for the constraints and other functions .",
    "because we do not have data placed along this value of @xmath53 we interpolate it from our existing data using a third order interpolation scheme .",
    "the convergence rate of the hamiltonian and momentum constraints is based on data at two resolutions and the assumption that the true value is zero , and for any other quantity the convergence is calculated by comparing results obtained at three resolutions ( keeping the ratio @xmath156 fixed ) in a similar manner as reported in  @xcite . in all cases , we assume that our functions are converging according to the formula @xmath157 where @xmath158 is a constant and @xmath159 is either @xmath6 , @xmath160 , or @xmath161 depending on whether we are using high , medium , or low resolution .",
    "the constraints are thus measured by substituting the numerically computed constraint for @xmath162 , zero for @xmath163 and the ( radial ) grid resolution for @xmath164 .",
    "the convergence of the constraints is given by @xmath165 when we are not converging toward a known answer , for example when testing the convergence of the values of the field variables for the matter and the spacetime metric , we use the standard three point convergence formula @xmath166 in all cases that we show in this paper , we find that the convergence rate @xmath167 is approximately @xmath160 for most quantities , i.e. , the code is globally second order accurate .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the two starting codes from which the present code has been built upon , that is the matter and the vacuum spacetime codes , were also , originally , second order accurate .",
    "the coupling of them both into a unique code has not diminished the final convergence order .    for a sample case , analyzed in detail in section  [ rotating ] below ,",
    "we show convergence numbers in table  [ tab : converge ] and two plots of the constraint violation ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : ham ] , [ fig : mom1 ] ) .",
    "the convergence is measured after an evolution time of @xmath168 .",
    "the resolutions used for this test are @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 zones , in the radial and polar directions , respectively .",
    "the parameters describing the conformal density of the initial model are @xmath172 and the angular momentum of the spacetime is @xmath173 ( to understand the meaning of these parameters we refer to eq .  ( [ shell ] ) ) . in the plots",
    ", we show the violation of the hamiltonian constraint and the @xmath52-component of the momentum constraint for the medium ( @xmath174 ) and high resolution runs .",
    "if the equations are converging at second order , then the two lines in each figure should be right on top of one another  as they are .",
    "we have first tested the hydrodynamical piece of the code against the analytic , spherically symmetric , bondi accretion solutions  ( @xcite , see also  @xcite for its relativistic extension ) .",
    "we have verified that the code reproduces them , both for dust and a perfect fluid , when the background metric is kept fixed , to within a few percent for evolutions of @xmath175 .    however ,",
    "in dynamic spacetimes , one will not normally use a slicing that maintains a static metric , even if the underlying geometry has evolved to a stationary state .",
    "therefore it is important to develop testbeds of known results , like the spherical bondi accretion solution , but in non - analytic slicings which are commonly used in numerical relativity .",
    "we shall employ maximal slicing , but with different boundary conditions than those found in the stationary schwarzschild metric .",
    "therefore we compare the evolution of matter in a _ dynamically _ sliced spacetime which does not react to the presence of that matter distribution . in other words ,",
    "the metric variables evolve completely independent of the hydrodynamical quantities ( just as in vacuum spacetimes ) whereas the latter evolve in a dynamic spacetime .",
    "this is a new type of testbed that we are developing for matter flows accreting onto dynamic , and dynamically sliced , black holes .",
    "we now wish to compare the analytic solution to the numerical one obtained in this dynamic slicing .",
    "it is nontrivial to do this in general , since one must compare invariant quantities at the same spacetime points in the two systems .",
    "coordinate values will not suffice , since in the dynamically sliced case they are moving through spacetime . in the original",
    "slicing everything is a function of @xmath60 only , while in the new slicing everything depends on space and time , i.e. on the new coordinates @xmath176 and @xmath177 . the rest - mass density , for example ,",
    "is given by @xmath178 in the analytic solution , but in the new slicing it is an evolving quantity @xmath179 .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to reconstruct @xmath60 from @xmath176 and @xmath177 and thus to compare the time - evolved quantity , @xmath179 , with the analytic solution , @xmath178 .",
    "the value of @xmath60 is simply the areal radius @xmath180 . in fig .",
    "[ bondicomp ] we see the result of an evolution with a non - schwarzschild slicing . we plot the numerically evolved value of @xmath29 ( i.e. @xmath179 ) with a dotted line . for reference",
    ", we also plot the initial value with a solid line .",
    "note that when @xmath181 it is true that @xmath182 .",
    "the line marked with circles ( @xmath183 ) represents the value of @xmath29 as a function of the reconstructed @xmath60 ( i.e. @xmath184 ) .",
    "the solid line and the line for @xmath183 are really the same function , therefore , plotted with the areal radius as calculated at the times @xmath185 and @xmath186 respectively . clearly the numerically evolved solution ( dotted line )",
    "agrees with the analytic ( @xmath183 ) solution to a high accuracy ( and the constraints converged to second order ) .",
    "we now increase the complexity of the problem by  switching on \" the matter fields appearing in the spacetime equations .",
    "we start showing the effects of a full coupling with the same matter fields of the previous section .",
    "hence , initially , we assume a spherical distribution of dust with zero velocity and constant conformal energy density .",
    "then , we solve the hamiltonian and momentum constraint equations in order to obtain initial thermodynamic profiles satisfying einstein equations .",
    "first , we consider a small uniform density , @xmath187 , and solve the hamiltonian constraint at @xmath185 , which , in turn , modifies the spacetime geometry . in fig .",
    "[ dynslice1 ] we show the evolution of the radial metric function @xmath88 up to a final time of @xmath188 in intervals of @xmath189 .",
    "we use a coarse radial grid of @xmath190 zones and only one angular zone , with the outer boundary placed at @xmath191 .",
    "the solid line in this figure corresponds to the dynamically sliced schwarzschild evolution discussed previously ( a _ partly coupled _ evolution ) .",
    "now we find , of course , a very different behavior from the standard bondi accretion , where this metric function would remain time independent , which is merely a manifestation of the singularity avoiding maximal slicing used .",
    "the evolution of the radial metric function @xmath88 for the fully coupled case is shown as a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ dynslice1 ] .",
    "note that for such a small density distribution , the effects of the matter on the spacetime geometry evolution are negligible .",

    "however , in the fully coupled evolutions , matter falls onto the black hole increasing its radius and causing the lapse to collapse more quickly in a larger interior region . as a result of this , the grid stretching effect which creates the peak in @xmath88 occurs , in the high density run , at a more distant part of the grid than for the low density case .",

    "one can again see the characteristic collapse of the lapse in the inner regions and the growth of the metric component @xmath88 .",
    "the behavior of the total velocity is also similar to that found in the spherical accretion problem .",
    "the non - spherical aspect of this simulation is the initial distribution of the matter density .",
    "as this initial distribution has equatorial plane symmetry we only plot the results in the first quadrant .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ shell2 ] profiles of the density along the axis ( @xmath73 ) and for different times of the evolution . clearly noticeable is the infall of the shell towards the hole accompanied by its collapse .",
    "as the shell does not have spherical symmetry , this implosion induces the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "we compute the even - parity @xmath223 and @xmath224 modes of the emitted radiation and they are plotted in figs .  [ shell3 ] and  [ shell4 ] , respectively ( odd - parity modes are absent in these non - rotating simulations ) .",
    "we also show in these plots a fit against the first two harmonics of the corresponding quasinormal modes .",
    "clearly , they agree quite closely with the wave one expects to see for a black hole with a mass comparable to the entire dust - shell - plus - black - hole system . we emphasize that these quasinormal mode fits are not perturbative evolutions , as discussed above , but rather comparisons with known complex oscillation frequencies of black holes .",
    "the phase and amplitude of the two lowest modes are adjusted for a best fit to the obtained waveforms .",
    "we also compute the total energy radiated away by these two modes . for the @xmath223 we find @xmath225 and for the @xmath224 we get @xmath226 .",
    "these values are normalized to the adm mass of the spacetime .",
    "next , we turn to another technique for studying a black hole accreting matter : examining the horizon dynamics .",
    "as discussed above , the black hole apparent horizon can give important information about the system .",
    "its area is related to the black hole mass , and combining the study of radiation emitted by gravitational waves can provide powerful checks on the overall energy accounting of the system .",
    "energy conservation is very important in traditional hydrodynamics , but for dynamic spacetimes we must develop new techniques to account for radiation and the difficulty of localizing energy in general relativity . in this case",
    "one can use several completely independent measures of the energy in the system that should be related : the final mass @xmath153 of the black hole , after all mass - energy has fallen in , will be given by the horizon area through eq .",
    "( [ mah ] ) and the total energy radiated , @xmath227 can be computed from the zerilli function @xmath146 . in principle",
    "these should add up to the total adm mass of the spacetime , @xmath228 , computed at large radius .",
    "this has been used extensively in vacuum .",
    "we now apply these techniques to black holes surrounded by matter .",
    "we consider a black hole plus matter spacetime with a non - flat background metric , hence inducing a more significant contribution of radiation energy .",
    "the specific non - flat background metric we employ is called the brill wave metric , and it allows us to place a packet of gravitational wave energy of any desired width at any distance from the central black hole . for details of the construction of this metric see  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ account ] we show various energy measures for this system .",
    "the thick lines shows the mass of the apparent horizon as a function of time .",
    "it grows as matter and gravitational wave energy fall in rapidly , and then settles down at roughly @xmath229 .",
    "it is actually still growing slowly here because some matter is still falling in , but the amount is negligibly small . in order to compute the apparent horizon mass to the accuracy desired for this plot it was necessary to run at very high resolutions  in the final case shown",
    "the evolution was performed using 900 radial zones . as noted previously ,",
    "this resolution is not needed to accurately compute the position of the apparent horizon , nor the energy in the radiation zone .",
    "we also show the adm mass as a solid thin line , indicating the total mass of the spacetime . in principle",
    ", the black hole mass can not exceed this limit , although it does at late times due to numerical error .",
    "finally , we indicate the total radiated energy , computed through the zerilli function , by a dotted thin line .",
    "the distance between the solid and dashed lines equals @xmath227 .",
    "if all mass energy has gone into the black hole , one should see @xmath230 .",
    "[ account ] shows that this is quite closely achieved numerically , even though the total energy radiated is only @xmath231 .",
    "the small gap between the energy radiated and the horizon mass is attributed to two effects : first , not all matter has actually fallen into the horizon by this time , and second , the apparent horizon mass will always be less than the event horizon mass in such cases .",
    "we regard this energy accounting issue as an important test and diagnostic of the physics of black hole accretion in dynamic black hole spacetimes .",
    "however , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ account ] , our studies indicate that this test is a very sensitive measure of global error .",
    "the crucial difficulty lies in resolving the peak in the metric function @xmath88 that develops near the horizon .",
    "small errors there translate into large deviations in the area calculation .",
    "apparent horizon boundary conditions will aid this kind of study greatly .      finally , we present some results concerning the evolution of matter in rotating spacetimes .",
    "the way in which these spacetimes are constructed and evolved is the same as in  @xcite . in a rotating spacetime",
    ", constant @xmath52 observers along the equator are spinning around the black hole . in consequence ,",
    "their fall through the horizon is slower and grid stretching is less near the equator .",
    "this is noticeable in the plots we show below . for the rotating cases below",
    "we generally choose a lapse which is symmetric across the throat , although in principle either choice ( symmetric or antisymmetric ) is possible .    to show the behavior of the code when rotation is present we choose the same shell as in the previous section .",
    "the initial data set for the spacetime is based on a rotating bowen and york  @xcite black hole .",
    "we use this construction instead of kerr for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we should note , however , that it contains radiation in the initial slice due to the construction of the initial data .",
    "however , the process of adding matter to a kerr black hole and solving the initial constraints would also introduce radiation .",
    "therefore , we choose the simpler initial data set provided by bowen and york  @xcite .    following  @xcite , we choose @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the total angular momentum of the spacetime .",
    "we set initially @xmath234 .",
    "we use a grid of @xmath235 radial zones and @xmath236 angular zones , with @xmath237 . with the same shell parameters of the previous section we have an adm mass of @xmath238 which gives a maximum rotation parameter of @xmath239 . for comparison",
    ", we note that without the presence of matter this black hole system has an adm mass of @xmath240 .",
    "hence , the surrounding matter has a significant effect on the black hole spacetime .",
    "however , the resulting black hole is not necessarily highly distorted , as it could result in a larger black hole with a small perturbation .",
    "we evolve the initial data up to a time of @xmath203 . by this time",
    "the final aspect of the lapse , metric function @xmath88 , total velocity and density look very similar to the non - rotating run displayed in fig .",
    "[ shell1 ] .",
    "however , at much earlier times of the evolution , all variables present a more clear angular dependence as a consequence of the rotation .",
    "this is more pronounced as @xmath109 increases . as an example we plot in fig .",
    "[ rotshell0 ] the metric component @xmath88 at @xmath241 .",
    "the complexity of our system is now clearly greater than in previous models as we have additional quantities to evolve , e.g. , the metric function @xmath84 or the @xmath54 component of the shift . the @xmath54 component of the proper 4-velocity of the fluid is now different from zero as well .",
    "however , the corresponding 3-velocity component , as defined by @xmath242 should be zero , after being corrected by the shift .",
    "we find this to be the case in our numerical integration .",
    "we also use this run to test the ability of the code to conserve angular momentum as measured by eq .",
    "[ angularmom ] .",
    "we find that the initial angular momentum of the spacetime is accurately maintained to within @xmath243 of the initial value , @xmath234 , at all points on the grid after @xmath244 and converges away to second order .",
    "this behavior is indeed what one expects as there is no physical viscosity in the dust shell that could transfer the angular momentum .",
    "in fact , as stressed previously , the matter in this case is not carrying angular momentum , which can be seen from our initial data choice @xmath245 . the matter fields actually are measured by to the so - called zero - angular - momentum - observers ( zamo s ) , which although rotating , do not carry angular momentum .",
    "we also compare the effects of the rotation and matter fields on the shape of the horizon .",
    "this is a further analysis technique that proved very useful in vacuum spacetime , which has also seen some use in matter spacetimes as well .",
    "smarr  @xcite showed that for vacuum kerr spacetimes , the horizon had an oblate shape parameterized by the spin parameter @xmath58 . for larger @xmath58 ,",
    "the horizon becomes more oblate , as one might expect from naive considerations of spinning objects bulging at the equator .",
    "previously , we found that for dynamic rotating black holes , the horizon oscillates about this oblate shape , settling down to its equilibrium value expected for a kerr black hole of the appropriate mass and angular momentum .",
    "in fact , simply by measuring the horizon shape , one could determine its mass , angular momentum , and oscillation frequency  @xcite .",
    "we now apply this technique to black holes surrounded by accreting matter .    for this purpose",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ rotshell0_1 ] the ratio of the polar to the equatorial horizon circumference ( @xmath246 ) for a sample of four runs : a vacuum run with @xmath247 , a run with low mass density and @xmath247 , a run with high mass density and @xmath247 , and a run with high mass density and @xmath248 . for each plot",
    "we also include a straight horizontal line corresponding to the value of @xmath249 for a kerr black hole with the same value of @xmath250 .",
    "the low density matter distribution is given by eq .",
    "( [ shell ] ) with parameters @xmath215 , @xmath251 , @xmath219 and @xmath252 .",
    "correspondingly , the high density matter distribution has the same values of @xmath212 and @xmath210 but the parameters @xmath214 and @xmath211 are ten times bigger .    the point to notice in fig .",
    "[ rotshell0_1 ] is that only the vacuum case settles down to the expected value of @xmath249 for the kerr spacetime given its angular momentum and adm mass .",
    "the others settle down to something slightly different . in the low mass density case",
    "it is a little less spherical whereas in the high mass density case it is something a little more spherical . we expect that if all matter had fallen in the black hole , the standard kerr result would be obtained . clearly , the spacetime must be settling down to some quasi - stationary solution that corresponds to kerr surrounded by matter .",
    "this is a very interesting point that should be explored further in future work .",
    "the effect of matter around a black hole on its geometry and oscillation structure has not received much attention , yet it could have important astrophysical consequences . as gravitational wave detectors begin to see waves from black holes ,",
    "a particularly intriguing possibility is that they may carry information about not only the black holes themselves , but also about the astrophysical environment surrounding them  @xcite .",
    "the rotational implosion of the shell induces the emission of odd - parity gravitational waves in addition to even - parity modes .",
    "we plot in figs .",
    "[ rotshell1 ] , [ rotshell2 ] and [ rotshell3 ] the @xmath253 and 5 modes of the emitted radiation with a fit against the first two harmonics of the corresponding quasinormal modes .",
    "again we note that these fits are made to the known quasinormal modes of _ vacuum _ black holes , although not all matter has crossed the horizon by this time .",
    "further work should be done to study the effect of a `` dirty '' environment on the mode structure of black holes  @xcite .",
    "we have presented a new numerical code to study the evolution of matter in black hole axisymmetric spacetimes in general relativity . despite the",
    "well known  axis instability \" of general relativistic axisymmetric codes we are able to evolve , during a reasonable amount of time into the future , different initial matter configurations .",
    "the two building blocks of the code , spacetime and hydrodynamics , are fully coupled through the source terms ( and fluxes ) of both systems .",
    "the extreme dynamical range of variation of the metric quantities , as shown typically in the peak of the radial function @xmath88 , the grid stretching or the formation of singularities , make the hydrodynamical integration quite a difficult enterprise . within a dynamical spacetime framework ,",
    "the computation becomes much more challenging than in the unrealistic case of an static background gravitational field , but it allows one to study the complete problem , including the effects of the matter on the black hole evolution and its corresponding structure and emission of gravitational waves . as this paper focuses on the development and testing of such a code and associated analysis tools to study the resulting physics , we defer detailed application to astrophysical scenarios to future investigations .    the integration scheme used in the code is based on finite differencing the partial differential equations . for the hydrodynamic equations we have used an advanced _ high - resolution shock - capturing _ scheme built on approximate riemann solvers .",
    "the integration of the adm field equations was done with an standard explicit second order runge - kutta scheme with centered differencing .",
    "we have presented convergence tests of the code as well as a sufficient set of astrophysical applications .",
    "these include the spherical accretion of matter onto a black hole , the implosion of dust shells and the evolution of matter in a rotating black hole spacetime .",
    "we have also computed the waveforms induced by the presence of the matter in some of the aforementioned simulations .",
    "because dynamic black holes accreting matter have not been studied previously , we developed a new series of testbeds appropriate for this problem and applied them to our code .",
    "( a ) building on the standard bondi accretion on static black hole metric , which is an analytic solution , we showed how one can compare the numerical solution obtained by on a dynamically sliced background .",
    "( b ) we also showed how one can computed radiation waveforms from the fully coupled matter - black hole system , which are emitted as the accretion induces oscillations in the black hole spacetime .",
    "( c ) we applied a set of analysis tools developed to study the properties of black hole horizons in vacuum spacetimes to the accretion problem , and found them to be useful in studying the energy accounting of the entire black hole plus matter plus radiation system .",
    "we also studied the geometry of the black hole horizon as it is distorted by the presence of matter falling in .",
    "one particularly interesting point which emerges from these studies is the possibility that the matter surrounding the black hole perturbs it in a measurable way .",
    "the geometry of the hole is seen to be changed by the presence of matter , and it is possible that the radiation structure that one hopes to measure ultimately may be affected as well@xcite .",
    "this will need much more study in the future ; a fully coupled hydrodynamics and spacetime code like the one developed here can address this problem in its full non - linearity .",
    "in subsequent work we plan to extend the results presented here performing detailed comparative and parametric studies of the different scenarios just outlined in the present investigation , including axisymmetric ( non - spherical ) accretion onto black holes and its effect on the structure of the black hole geometry and on the gravitational radiation emitted , the head - on collision of stars with black holes and a detailed comparison with recently developed perturbative treatments of matter flows around black holes  @xcite .",
    "we also plan to use these results and this code as a testbed for future computations with the three - dimensional coupled code , called cactus , we are currently developing  @xcite .",
