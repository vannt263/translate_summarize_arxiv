    "the watt balance , which was originally proposed by dr .",
    "b p kibble at the national physical laboratory ( npl , uk ) in 1975 @xcite , is an experiment currently for precision measurement of the planck constant @xmath5 , and in future for maintaining one of the seven base units , the kilogram @xcite .",
    "the operation of a watt balance is divided into two independent measurement modes , respectively known as the weighing mode and the velocity mode . in the weighing mode , a magnetic force generated by current - carrying coil in a magnetic field",
    "is balanced by the weight of a test mass @xmath6 as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the local gravitational acceleration , @xmath9 the magnetic flux density at coil position , @xmath10 the wire length of the coil , and @xmath11 the current in coil . in the velocity mode",
    ", the coil is moved in the magnetic field with a velocity @xmath12 in vertical direction , inducing a voltage @xmath13 on the coil terminals . by a combination of the weighing and velocity modes , the geometrical factor @xmath14",
    "is eliminated and a virtual watt balance equation , i.e. , @xmath15 , would be obtained . as a result",
    ", the planck constant @xmath5 can be related to the test mass @xmath6 by comparing the electrical power to the mechanical power in conjunction with the quantum hall effect @xcite and the josephson effect @xcite .",
    "since the proposal in 1975 , the watt balance has been widely spread and persuaded at many national metrology institutes ( nmis ) @xcite .",
    "the detailed principle and recent progress of watt balance experiments at nmis can be found in several review papers , e.g. , @xcite .    in order to obtain enough magnetic force ,",
    "e.g. , 5n , and in the meanwhile keep the power assumption of the coil as low as possible , a strong magnetic field is preferred in watt balance . in realization ,",
    "the watt balance usually employs permanent magnets as the magnetic flux source and uses soft yokes to guide the generated flux through a small air gap where the coil is placed . as most of the magneto motive force ( mmf ) in such magnetic circuits would drop across the air gap ,",
    "the magnetic flux in the air gap would be strong . besides , the field boundary on yoke - air surfaces is sharp with high - permeability yokes , and hence the field uniformity in the air gap is good .",
    "but one disadvantage for such magnetic circuit is that the magnetic field gradient in the horizontal direction is obviously increased , which may bring difficulties for the alignment @xcite .",
    "as is noticed , the alignment is one of the most difficult procedures in operating a watt balance , and several techniques that can relax the alignment have been proposed : the simultaneous measurement of two operating modes has been carried out in watt balance at the bureau international des poids et mesures ( bipm ) @xcite , which has been further developed by dr .",
    "i a robinson in @xcite ; new experimental designs of watt balances , of course , can relax the alignment @xcite .    here in this paper , a misalignment correction idea based on measurement of coil position and representation of magnetic field in the air gap , is considered .",
    "the merit of the correction method is that it would relax the alignment and can be applied on all the existing watt balances without redeveloping new apparatus .",
    "the coil position in both modes of a watt balance can be well measured as a necessary requirement of the experiment . in order to eliminate the misalignment error to a level below @xmath16 by correction ,",
    "a key procedure is to know the three - dimensional ( 3d ) magnetic profile in the operating interval of the air gap .",
    "however , limited to the mechanical realization , only several vertical profiles of @xmath0 at different horizontal coordinates can be determined by the gradient coil ( gc ) method @xcite or a high resolution magnetic probe .",
    "knowing a set of subjected information , a natural question is : how can we solve the whole filed in the air gap by using minimum measurable quantities ? to answer this question , in this paper , we present an algorithm that can represent the 3d magnetic profile of the air gap based on @xmath1 additional measurements of @xmath0 profiles .    the outline for the rest of this paper is organized as follows : the algorithm principle is presented in section 2 which is originated from polynomial estimation of the @xmath2 function following maxwell s equations in the static magnetic circuit , and in section 3 , numeral verifications by a cubic estimation of the @xmath2 function with one additional @xmath0 measurement are shown ; in section 4 , the equations for misalignment correction are reviewed and discussed ; a conclusion is drawn in section 5 .",
    "a typical magnetic structure employed in watt balance with one coil and two permanent magnet rings has been shown in figure [ fig.1 ] . the magnetic circuit was first presented in the bipm watt balance group @xcite , and later followed by the metas mark ii watt balance at the federal institute of metrology , switzerland @xcite , the nist-4 watt balance at the national institute of standards and technology , usa @xcite , the msl watt balance at the measurement standards laboratory , new zealand @xcite , and the kriss watt balance at the korea research institute of standards and science , south korea @xcite .",
    "the shown magnet structure is preferred due to the advantages including generation of a strong magnetic field in the air gap , a good magnetic shielding , and the possibility of a compact size realization .    in the shown symmetrical magnetic structure ,",
    "two permanent magnet rings are arranged with opposite magnetization poles and their flux , guided by high - permeability yokes , runs horizontally through the air gap where the coil is suspended .",
    "the air gap is located between two parallel cylindrical yokes , i.e. , the inner yoke and the outer yoke , and its width is conventionally several centimeters .",
    "the height of the air gap is typically tens of centimeters and the central part with several centimeters is the applied measurement interval in the velocity mode",
    ". normally , both the weighing and velocity modes are operated in a chosen measurement interval along the central @xmath0 profile , which can be well adjusted with a relative filed change of several parts in @xmath17 .",
    "note that there are some other realizations of watt balance magnets , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "although the model and analysis presented in this paper is based on the magnet shown in figure [ fig.1 ] , they can be also applied in other magnet structures .",
    "we first present the generalized magnetostatic equations to describe the field in the air gap for further discussion of the proposed algorithm . for a static magnet circuit shown in figure [ fig.1 ] ,",
    "the differential forms of maxwell s equations for the magnetic field in the air gap are written respectively as @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes a three dimensional vector of the current density , @xmath21 is the vector of the magnetic flux density in the air gap , and @xmath22 is the permeability in vacuum ; @xmath23 is the del operator defined as @xmath24 where ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) is a unit vector in the cylindrical coordinate ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) .",
    "writing the vector @xmath21 in equation ( [ eq.max1 ] ) in forms of three components in the cylindrical coordinate , i.e. , @xmath31 , we obtain @xmath32}{\\partial r}+\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial b_\\phi(r,\\phi , z)}{\\partial \\phi}+\\frac{\\partial b_z(r,\\phi , z)}{\\partial z}=0 .",
    "\\label{eq.maxi}\\ ] ] since the presented magnet in figure [ fig.1 ] has a @xmath33 symmetrical structure , it meets the following relations for the magnetic flux density in the air gap that @xmath34 as a result , equation ( [ eq.maxi ] ) can be rewritten in a two dimensional form as @xmath35}{\\partial r}+\\frac{\\partial b_z(r , z)}{\\partial z}=0 .",
    "\\label{eq.maxi2d}\\ ] ]    similarly , if @xmath36 , equation ( [ eq.max2 ] ) can be expressed by three components in the cylindrical coordinate respectively as @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39}{\\partial r}-\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial b_r(r,\\phi , z)}{\\partial \\phi}=\\mu_0j_{z}(r,\\phi , z ) . \\label{eq.maxii3}\\ ] ]    note that equations ( [ eq.maxii1])-([eq.maxii3 ] ) are written in the space of the air gap , where the current density should equal zero , i.e. , @xmath40 . besides , based on equation ( [ eq:3zeros ] ) , both left sides of equation ( [ eq.maxii1 ] ) and equation ( [ eq.maxii3 ] ) equal zero , therefore , equations ( [ eq.maxii1])-([eq.maxii3 ] ) can be simplified by an equation in two dimensional form as @xmath41    equations ( [ eq.maxi2d ] ) and ( [ eq.maxii2d ] ) , which present the basic relations between two components of the magnetic flux density , i.e. , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , are the magnetostatic equations for the magnetic field in the air gap of the shown watt balance magnet .       profile along the radical direction between two surfaces of the inner and outer yokes at a certainty vertical position @xmath44.,width=307 ]    in this section , some discussions on the fringe field effect of the air gap are prepared for the algorithm .",
    "based on the electromagnetic knowledge , the vertical component of the magnetic flux density in the air gap , i.e. , @xmath43 , is generated by a finite height of the air gap , which is known as the fringe filed effect .",
    "the schematic of the fringe field for the magnetic filed in the air gap has been shown in figure [ fig.2](a ) , and it is known that the fringe effect would bend the magnetic flux at both upper and lower ends of the air gap . as a result , the absolute value for the vertical magnetic component @xmath4 will increase along a vertical axis departing the center position ( @xmath45 ) . in theory ,",
    "if the upper and lower magnets are symmetrical , only the magnetic field line at the radical center has zero vertical magnetic component , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "as high - permeability yokes are used , the boundary on the yoke - air surface is very sharp , and it is reasonable to consider the magnetic flux at both yoke - air surfaces to be ideally radical , i.e. , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the air gap width . it can be proved in mathematics , as well as in conjunction with maxwell s equations , the @xmath2 function is a typical one - extremum function . a typical @xmath2 function curve with @xmath49 has been shown in figure [ fig.2](b ) , which usually has two approximate zero values at surfaces and one extremum @xmath50 around the central air gap .",
    "the proposed algorithm employs @xmath51 measurements of @xmath0 profiles at different radii , i.e. , @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "the central profile @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is the central radius of the air gap ) , conventionally being measured in the velocity mode of a watt balance , is included and indexed as @xmath56 .",
    "the other @xmath57 measurements of @xmath0 profiles indexed form 1 to @xmath57 are specially designed for supplying additional information for the algorithm .",
    "it should be noted that a larger number of @xmath57 will obtain a better estimation accuracy but it would obviously increase the complexity of the measurements , e.g. , a multi - coil with @xmath57 upper coil and @xmath57 lower coils is required if the gc method is applied .",
    "the goal of this paper is to represent the whole air gap magnetic field by very small numbers of additional @xmath0 measurements , e.g. , @xmath58 , with acceptable accuracy for relaxing the alignment .    in the calculation ,",
    "@xmath51 measurements of @xmath0 profiles are taken , and hence @xmath51 values of @xmath59 along the radical direction of the air gap can be calculated by equation ( [ eq.maxii2d ] ) . as discussed in section",
    "[ 2.3 ] , it is reasonable to make the vertical component of the magnetic flux density at both yoke - air surfaces equal zero , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "when @xmath57 is a small number , the information with knowing @xmath51 differential values and 2 initial values at yoke - air surfaces for the @xmath2 function , however , is still not enough for solving the magnetic flux density along the radical direction .    in order to make up the information lacking and ensure the field representation accuracy , a pre - estimation of @xmath2 is applied .",
    "it has been pointed out in section [ 2.3 ] and shown in figure [ fig.2](b ) that the @xmath2 function is a one - extremum function with two zero values at yoke - air surfaces . a polynomial estimation of @xmath2 function should be feasible and can be applied in the algorithm .",
    "the polynomial estimation employs the @xmath60 profile and the other @xmath57 additional @xmath0 measurements at different radii for best estimating the vertical magnetic component in the radical direction , which can yield a polynomial estimator with maximum order @xmath61 .",
    "the main idea of the proposed approach is to fit the @xmath2 function at every vertical coordinate by a @xmath62 order polynomial function in dimension @xmath28 of the air gap as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a gain factor ; @xmath65 is the @xmath66th solution of @xmath67 while @xmath68 and @xmath69 are considered as its first and second solutions .",
    "it can be seen from equation ( [ eq.times ] ) that @xmath43 is expressed by a product of two functions with separated directions , i.e. , the two dimensions ( @xmath28 and @xmath30 ) of the @xmath4 function is decoupled , therefore , the calculation of the magnetic field in the air gap is greatly simplified . for each @xmath52 measurement , it can be written by equation ( [ eq.maxii2d ] ) as @xmath70    the left part of equation ( [ eq.brm ] ) is directly measured while the right part of equation ( [ eq.brm ] ) can be expressed by the estimator following equation ( [ eq.times ] ) . as a result , @xmath51 unknown parameters , i.e. , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , can be solved by @xmath51 equations in ( [ eq.brm ] ) . substituting the solved parameters back into equation ( [ eq.times ] ) ,",
    "the @xmath4 function on the whole air gap is obtained .    knowing the @xmath4 function in the air gap",
    ", we can directly calculate values of the differential function @xmath73 at any single point @xmath74 . according to equation",
    "( [ eq.maxi2d ] ) , @xmath75/\\partial r$ ] is solved as @xmath76}{\\partial r}=-r\\frac{\\partial b_z(r , z)}{\\partial z}. \\label{eq.brd}\\ ] ]    to ensure the calculation accuracy in the actual operation area of a watt balance , the initial condition of @xmath77 is applied in the algorithm , the @xmath78 function and hence the @xmath3 function in the air gap is solved .    in summary , both @xmath4 and @xmath42 , i.e. , a 3d magnetic field representation in the air gap , can be solved by polynomial estimation of @xmath2 function .",
    "the minimum number of additional @xmath0 measurements for the estimation equation ( [ eq.times ] ) in theory can be zero , i.e. , @xmath79 .",
    "note that this case is established only when a @xmath0 profile with @xmath80 is known . for watt balance experiments ,",
    "the @xmath54 profile is preferred to obtain a larger vertical interval with good uniformity but the gain factor @xmath72 in this case can not be solved .",
    "therefore , in order to represent the 3d magnetic field in the air gap for watt balance , at least one additional @xmath0 profile measurement should be taken .",
    "in order to evaluating the model accuracy presented in section [ section2 ] , here some numeral simulations based on finite element method ( fem ) are performed . in the simulation ,",
    "the geometrical parameters of the magnet have been shown in figure [ fig.4 ] .",
    "the relative permeability of the yoke is set as @xmath81 and the magnetic strength of the permanent magnet is set as 800ka / m in the vertical @xmath30 direction .",
    "note that in the simulation of a watt balance magnet , the nonlinearity of the yoke permeability , instead of a constant number , should be considered .",
    "however , in our approach , the nonlinear information has already been contained in measurements of @xmath52 profiles . in such cases ,",
    "the real magnet can be simplified by a constant - permeability one and no obvious error would be generated in evaluating the model accuracy . in the simulation , five magnetic profiles @xmath82mm@xmath83 , @xmath84mm@xmath83 , @xmath85mm@xmath83 , @xmath86mm@xmath83 , and @xmath87mm@xmath83 shown in figure [ fig.5 ] , are firstly calculated as possible known conditions of the presented model to simulated the actual measurements of either a gc coil or a magnetic probe .",

    "this relationship can be physically explained : the total flux through the air gap , @xmath111 , is a fixed number only determined by the mmf of the permanent magnet and the magnetic reluctance of the circuit ; since the magnetic flux on each surface is approximate uniform , the total flux can be expressed as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the height of the air gap .",
    "therefore , @xmath114 , i.e. , @xmath109 decays along @xmath28 direction with @xmath110 .",
    "besides , the calculation of @xmath115 also clearly shows the fringe filed effect , i.e. , @xmath116 increases quickly in the air gap when @xmath30 is departing from the central radical surface @xmath45 .    in order to show the calculation accuracy of the proposed algorithm ,",
    "the errors in the focused space , compared to fem simulations , are calculated .",
    "the error maps for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 with different choices of the additional @xmath97 profile , i.e. , @xmath105 respectively equals to 201 mm , 205 mm , 215 mm , and 219 mm , have been shown in figure [ fig.7 ] .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ fig.7 ] that the calculation error is closely related to the choice of the additional @xmath117 profile .",
    "the maximum relative error in different cases when @xmath58 is about 0.1%0.4% for @xmath3 and about 4%16% for @xmath4 .",
    "the calculation result shows that the error when the additional @xmath0 is taken at @xmath118 is smaller than that when the additional @xmath0 is taken at @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , it is suggested to take an additional @xmath0 measurement in the outer half of the air yoke , e.g. , @xmath120 , when a cubic estimator is applied .      .",
    "additional @xmath0 profiles are adopted at two radii , @xmath105 and @xmath121 .",

    "two valuable conclusions have been found from the calculation : firstly , two additional measurements , @xmath117 and @xmath126 , can not be set symmetrical on @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath127 . otherwise , an infinite value for the gain factor @xmath72 would obtained . in this case , @xmath72 is expressed as @xmath128}{\\partial z}-\\delta_0 ^ 2\\delta_2\\frac{\\partial [ b_r(r_c , z)-b_r(r_1,z)]}{\\partial z}+12\\delta_1\\delta_2(\\delta_1-\\delta_2)\\frac{\\partial b_r(r_c , z)}{\\partial z}}{4\\delta_0 ^ 2\\delta_1\\delta_2(\\delta_1-\\delta_2)(\\delta_1+\\delta_2)},\\ ] ] where @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "obviously , the condition @xmath131 is not allowed .",
    "secondly , the calculation error with @xmath105 and @xmath121 chosen in the same half side of the air gap , either outer or inner parts , is smaller than the cases with @xmath105 and @xmath121 in different halves of the air gap .",
    "therefore , if the measurement with @xmath125 is taken , it is better to choose a same half of the air gap in radical direction , e.g. , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , or @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "higher order estimators with @xmath136 measurements of @xmath0 profiles contain more filed information , and in theory can improve the calculation accuracy .",
    "however , it would synchronously increase the complexity for both measurement and analytical solving unknown parameters of the estimator .",
    "limited to the paper length , no further calculation with higher order estimators is presented .",
    "the misalignment error @xmath137 of a watt balance has been presented in @xcite , expressed as @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are magnetic forces and torques generated in the weighing mode .",
    "note that @xmath141 and @xmath142 are results of the interaction between the coil current @xmath11 and the magnetic flux @xmath143 , which can be written respectively as @xmath144 @xmath145 in above equations , @xmath146 is the rotation angle of coil , and @xmath147 is a unit vector in @xmath148 space",

    "further , in conjunction with optical measurements of the velocity @xmath150 and the angular velocity @xmath151 , the misalignment error @xmath137 in equation ( [ eq.error ] ) can be determined , and a correction of misalignment errors in theory can be applied .",
    "it should be noted that all terms on the right side of equation ( [ eq.error ] ) are tinny values compared to 1 , which conventionally should be adjusted below @xmath16 by alignment .",
    "as presented , the proposed algorithm is expected to represent the 3d magnetic profile with an accuracy of several parts in @xmath152 with few additional measurements of @xmath0 profiles . on the one hand , under such situations",
    ", a whole field parameter can be supplied for alignment analysis .",
    "on the other hand , if the field information is used for misalignment correction , the alignment would be relaxed , e.g. , several parts in @xmath153 .",
    "an algorithm employing a polynomial estimator for functional fit of @xmath2 is presented to characterize the 3d magnetic field of a watt balance . based on maxwell s equations , the relations of two magnetic components in air gap of a watt balance magnet , @xmath3 and @xmath4",
