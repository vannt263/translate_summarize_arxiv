    "there has recently been much interest in coupling light with atomic ensembles to develop a quantum interface .",
    "several proposals have been published to utilise this kind of coupling for spin squeezing @xcite , quantum memories @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , entanglement @xcite , magnetometry @xcite and atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "many of these proposals have been realised experimentally using samples of alkali atoms in vapour cells and in magneto - optical traps ( mot ) @xcite .",
    "spin squeezing is the simplest of these applications , and is often regarded as a benchmark of the light - atomic - ensemble interaction .",
    "it has been demonstrated a few times : first in a mot by mapping squeezed states of light onto the atomic spin @xcite , then in vapour cells via a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement @xcite , and recently using the same method in a mot but with the help of feedback @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study the conditions for generating spin squeezing via a qnd measurement @xcite in a cold ensemble of @xmath0rb atoms using the @xmath1 ground state of the d@xmath2 transition .",
    "we show that this system is formally equivalent to a spin-1/2 system when suitable zeeman substates and quantum operators are used to define a pseudo - spin . in this scheme",
    ", we expect to have a higher light - atomic - ensemble coupling than in previous work even when possible sources of decoherence and loss arising from these choices are identified and taken into account .    this article is organised into five sections .",
    "the next and second section describes the interaction between atoms and light considered here . shows how the complicated @xmath0rb system can be reduced to an effective spin-1/2 system . in",
    ", we calculate the degree of squeezing attainable in the presence of decoherence and loss",
    ". finally , we present the conclusions in .",
    "spin squeezing can be created by using a polarised off - resonant pulse of light to perform a qnd measurement of the spin @xcite .",
    "first , the stokes vector @xmath3 ( polarisation ) of the probe pulse and the spin vector @xmath4 of the atomic ensemble are prepared in a coherent state pointing in the @xmath5-direction ( ( a ) ) .",
    "as we send the pulse through the sample , the light and atoms interact via the dipole interaction , which in this kind of schemes is described by the hamiltonian @xmath6        where @xmath7 is a coupling strength , @xmath8 is the @xmath9 component of the stokes vector @xmath10 of light , and @xmath11 is the @xmath9 component of the atomic spin vector @xmath12 . in this interaction , the polarisation of the light",
    "is rotated due to the faraday effect and there is a back action of the light onto atoms which rotates the orientation of the spin ( ( b ) ) , and at the same time , their quantum fluctuations become entangled @xcite .",
    "if this interaction acts for a time @xmath13 , then for small @xmath14 , it produces the following relation between the fluctuations of @xmath10 and @xmath15 @xcite : @xmath16 as can be seen , a measurement of @xmath17 with a polarimeter ( ( c ) ) contains information about the spin component @xmath18 .",
    "this qnd measurement leads to squeezing of the fluctuations @xmath19 .",
    "if we ignore decoherence and loss mechanisms , the degree of squeezing has been shown @xcite to be @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the resonant optical density and @xmath22 the integrated spontaneous emission rate ( number of photons scattered per atom over a probe pulse ) .",
    "the degree of squeezing is defined such that @xmath23 for a coherent state and @xmath24 for a squeezed state .",
    "the ideal case of a spin-@xmath25 system as the one depicted in ( a ) is simple to consider @xcite . in this system ,",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 modes of the field interact with four - level atoms of spin 1/2 .",
    "after adiabatically eliminating the excited states , this interaction is described by an interaction hamiltonian of the form ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , resulting in the typical relations ( [ eq : qnd ] ) between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . finally , we can squeeze the atomic spin by performing a qnd measurement through a measurement of @xmath28 .",
    "rb system ( solid arrows show the effective spin-1/2 system).,width=566 ]    when realising this kind of interaction in a realistic system like rb , one has to consider a more complicated , high - spin - number system , and therefore reformulate the problem . in our particular case of @xmath0rb ,",
    "the lowest spin number is 1 ( see ( b ) ) .",
    "one possible realisation in @xmath0rb is to use a coherent superposition of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 levels ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 from now on ) as shown in ( b ) . in this case , the chosen quantum observables are components of the alignment tensor , namely @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and @xmath35 @xcite . in fact @xmath36    we can now define a collective pseudo - spin @xmath37 by @xmath38 where the superscript @xmath39 denotes the single - atom operators and we sum over all atoms .",
    "this definition fulfils the angular - momentum commutation relations @xmath40 = i \\epsilon_{ijk } \\hat{j}_k,\\ ] ] when @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the levi - civita tensor .",
    "hence , one could squeeze the pseudo - spin @xmath37 along the @xmath9-axis , as in the ideal case , if a qnd - type interaction ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) exists between @xmath37 and @xmath3 .",
    "this interaction can be derived as follows .",
    "consider the dipole interaction hamiltonian for an off - resonant field @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the positive and negative frequency field operators of the probe field , @xmath45 is the detuning of the probe from the @xmath46 transition of the d@xmath2 line in @xmath0rb , and @xmath47 is the atomic polarisability tensor of the transition .",
    "the latter is a rank-2 spherical tensor , which can be decomposed into the direct sum of a scalar , a vector and a tensor term : @xmath48 .",
    "this leads to the decomposition of the interaction hamiltonian into @xmath49 , that can be expressed as @xcite @xmath50,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when we consider the transitions from the ground states @xmath51 to all the excited states @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath53 is the rank-@xmath54 unitless polarisability coefficient of the @xmath46 transition , @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is the photon ( atom ) number operator , and @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the spontaneous decay rate , @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) the transition wavelength ( frequency ) , and @xmath61 the interaction volume .",
    "the components of the stokes vector can be expressed in terms of the annihilation and creation operators of the @xmath62 modes of the field @xmath63 which can be related to the field operators @xmath64 .    as can be seen from ( [ eq : h0 ] ) , @xmath65 is proportional to @xmath66 and can be viewed as a global phase shift common to both polarisation modes of the probe pulse , which does not produce any signal on the output of the polarimeter , and therefore can be omitted .",
    "the term @xmath67 in the rank-2 hamiltonian ( [ eq : h2 ] ) corresponds to raman transitions between @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the other term is also proportional to @xmath66 , and can be omitted .",
    "furthermore , for the case of detunings much larger than the hyperfine splitting of the excited states ( @xmath70 can be neglected .",
    "a similar situation occurs for @xmath71 in ( [ eq : h1 ] ) , but this time only the contributions from @xmath72 tend to zero when @xmath73 system formed by the @xmath74 ground states and the @xmath75 excited state ( solid arrows in ( b ) ) , which does nt exhibit raman transitions , and therefore is formally equivalent to the simple spin-1/2 system of ( a ) .",
    "the remaining effective hamiltonian is @xmath76 which is of the form ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) necessary for the qnd interaction .",
    "we now consider the degree of squeezing for a general spin-@xmath77 system .",
    "the degree of squeezing defined by wineland @xcite for a frequency standard based on the ramsey method is @xmath78 which implies entanglement between the individual atomic spins when there is squeezing @xcite .    in the presence of scattering",
    ", atoms can be lost when they are pumped out of the initial atomic system , or can undergo decoherence when they stay within the system .",
    "these two cases are discussed in the following subsections , where we denote by @xmath79 the number of scattered photons which produce loss , and by @xmath80 those that produce decoherence , with @xmath81 .",
    "the case of atom loss occurs when the atoms are pumped out of the initial atomic system due to e.g. collisions with the background or spontaneous decay into a state not participating in the interaction .    in this case",
    ", it can be shown @xcite that the variance @xmath82 of the remaining @xmath83 atoms is @xmath84 using equation , the degree of squeezing for the remaining atoms is @xmath85    we now assume that @xmath86 atoms undergo decoherence due to scattering within the initial coherent superposition .",
    "the total variance of @xmath87 in this case is transformed in the same way as ( [ eq : lostvar ] ) , but with the added variance @xmath88 of the individual decohered atoms : @xmath89 and the degree of squeezing will be @xmath90      if we now consider the spin-1/2 system of ( a ) , we notice that in this scheme , atoms can only undergo decoherence due to photon scattering ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "hence , the degree of squeezing can be promptly calculated from and , and taking into account that the variance of each of the decohered atoms is @xmath93 .",
    "shows the calculated degree of squeezing as a function of the integrated scattering rate ( blue curves ) for ( a ) a standard mot with @xmath94 and ( b ) a typical far off - resonant trap ( fort ) with @xmath95 .     as a function of the integrated scattering rate @xmath22 for ( a ) a standard mot ( @xmath94 ) and ( b ) a standard fort ( @xmath95 ) , and for a coherent state ( red curve ) , the spin-1/2 system ( blue curve ) and the @xmath0rb system ( green curve).,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   as a function of the integrated scattering rate @xmath22 for ( a ) a standard mot ( @xmath94 ) and ( b ) a standard fort ( @xmath95 ) , and for a coherent state ( red curve ) , the spin-1/2 system ( blue curve ) and the @xmath0rb system ( green curve).,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    the case of @xmath0rb is again more complicated . assuming the probe light interacts only with the @xmath96 ground state , i.e.@xmath97 ,",
    "if the atoms decay into the @xmath98 hyperfine ground state , they do not interact with the light any more .",
    "furthermore , if they decay in the @xmath99 zeeman substate , they interact with both polarisation modes equally ( see ( b ) ) and do not produce any signal at the polarimeter .",
    "hence all these atoms have fallen out of the considered pseudo - spin system , and from the perspective of the light - atom interaction , these atoms are simply lost . on the other hand ,",
    "if the atoms are excited and decay back to the relevant states @xmath100 they will reduce the coherence of the system .    generalising the expressions above for the pseudo - spin @xmath37 and putting , and together , we can arrive to the following expression for the degree of squeezing in the presence of decoherence and loss @xmath101 where we have used @xmath102 . in our @xmath0rb system @xmath103 , according to the branching ratios that determine how @xmath22 splits .",
    "this expression is shown as green curves on .",
    "notice that although this system is an effective spin-1/2 system , it outperforms the ideal spin-1/2 system , illustrating the fact that spin squeezing is more robust against loss than against decoherence , as can be seen by comparing equations ( [ eq : lostvar ] ) and ( [ eq : decovar ] ) .",
    "as it is shown on , for a given value of @xmath21 there is an optimum value of @xmath22 for which @xmath104 is minimum .",
    "this arises from the fact that although scattering produces decoherence and loss , a certain degree of scattering is needed for the atoms to interact with the probe light .",
    "as much as 55% squeezing can be achieved for @xmath105 in a standard mot ( @xmath106 ) and 75% for @xmath107 in a typical fort ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "we have presented a scheme in @xmath0rb to perform spin squeezing of an atomic ensemble via a qnd measurement and compared it to an ideal spin-1/2 system .",
    "we have found that the rubidium system can be reduced to an effective spin-1/2 system for large detunings ( @xmath109 ) by considering the different tensor components of the atomic polarisability and choosing suitable optical polarisation and atomic states , and with the help of a pseudo - spin defined in terms of the alignment tensor .",
    "the degree of squeezing is derived for the rubidium system in the presence of scattering causing decoherence and loss , showing that it is more robust to loss than to decoherence .",
    "we describe how the system can decohere and lose atoms , and identify a minimum on @xmath104 for a given value of @xmath21 , which arises from the competition between the destructive scattering of photons and the desirable coupling between light and atoms . as much as 75% squeezing at @xmath107 is predicted for a typical fort with @xmath108 .",
