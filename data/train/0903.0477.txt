    "the disk undergoes a transition to a low-@xmath1 disk from the outer radii , and the whole disk becomes a low-@xmath1 disk when @xmath234 .",
    "the low-@xmath1 disks consist of two parts , an inner optically thick part and an outer optically thin part . in an optically thick low-@xmath1 disk , since @xmath235 , we obtain the radial dependence of the effective temperature , @xmath236 .",

    "we obtained thermal equilibrium curves for optically thin and optically thick accretion disks incorporating the mean azimuthal magnetic fields .",
    "we prescribed that the azimuthally averaged maxwell stress is proportional to the total ( gas , radiation , and magnetic ) pressure .",
    "consequently , the heating rate can be large if the magnetic pressure is high even when the gas pressure and the radiation pressure are low . to complete the set of basic equations",
    ", we specified the magnetic flux advection rate rather than the plasma @xmath1 at each radius .",
    "hence , a decrease in temperature via the cooling instability results in an increase in magnetic pressure due to the conservation of the azimuthal magnetic flux @xmath31 .    under these assumptions",

    "the slopes of the thermal equilibrium curves plotted in the @xmath93 vs. @xmath56 plane in figure [ x005al05sifoo ] and figure [ x005al01sifoo ] indicate that the low-@xmath1 disk is thermally stable .",
    "the borders between the optically thin and thick parts of the low-@xmath1 branches depend on @xmath140 which specifies the magnetic flux at each radius . as the magnetic flux advection rate increases ,",
    "the magnetic pressure becomes higher , therefore the magnetic heating rate increases .",
    "hence the equilibrium temperature becomes higher , and the surface density decreases .",

    "the adaf / riaf undergoes a transition to the low-@xmath1 disk from the outer radii as the mass accretion rate increases .",

    "@xcite carried out mhd simulations of the buoyant escape of the magnetic flux due to the parker instability .",
    "they showed that once a disk is dominated by the magnetic pressure , it can stay in the low-@xmath1 state because the strong magnetic tension suppresses the growth of the parker instability .",
    "@xcite suggested that such low-@xmath1 disks emit hard x - rays .",
    "when @xmath248 in the surface of the low-@xmath1 disk , the buoyant escape of the magnetic flux from the surface layer will reduce the total azimuthal magnetic flux of the disk .",
    "this loss of magnetic flux can balance the amplification of magnetic fields due to the mri in this layer .",
    "the results of three - dimensional global mhd simulations by @xcite indicate that low-@xmath1 disks stay in a quasi - equilibrium state at least for a thermal time scale .",
    "the longer time scale evolution of the low-@xmath1 disk is a subject to be studied in near future .",
    "one of the main aims of this paper is to explain the bright hard state observed in rising phases of the outbursts of bhcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ x005al05mdfoo ] shows that the optically thin part of the low-@xmath1 branch extends to @xmath249 for @xmath169 . in the adaf / riaf branches ,",
    "the disk temperature is independent of the mass accretion rate and remains nearly at the virial temperature .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the cutoff energy observed in the low / hard state of bhcs is independent of their luminosity .",
    "in contrast , the disk temperature roughly anti - correlates with the mass accretion rate in the optically thin low-@xmath1 branches .",
    "this indicates that the electron temperature in the hard x - ray emitting optically thin low-@xmath1 disks anti - correlates with the luminosity .",
    "this feature is consistent with the anti - correlation observed in the bright hard state of bhcs .",
    "in addition , the optically thin low-@xmath1 disks explain the bright / slow transition reported by @xcite . for small @xmath140",
    ", the adaf / riaf directly undergoes a transition to the optically thick disks emitting the soft x - rays at @xmath250 for @xmath157 ( panel ( h ) @xmath251 ( g ) @xmath251 ( f ) in figure [ disks ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to the dark / fast transition ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , for large @xmath140 , the adaf / riaf first undergoes a transition to the optically thin low-@xmath1 disk , which can be identified as the bright hard state .",
    "subsequently , this disk undergoes a transition to the optically thick disk at a mass accretion rate higher than the rate for small @xmath140 .",
    "this transition corresponds to the bright / slow transition .",
    "( panel ( h ) @xmath251 ( j ) @xmath251 ( i ) @xmath251 ( e ) in figure [ disks ] )    it is anticipated that if the magnetic flux escapes from the disk due to magnetic buoyancy or dissipates due to magnetic reconnection , the equilibrium curve may shift to the one for smaller @xmath140 .",
    "in such a case , the optically thin low-@xmath1 disk immediately undergoes a transition to the standard disk or the optically thick low-@xmath1 disk .",
    "this transition may accompany the ejection of jets observed during the hard - to - soft transition of bhcs because magnetic energy stored in the low-@xmath1 disk is released .",
    "although we have adopted the single temperature model ( @xmath252 ) , it has been pointed out that the electron temperature becomes lower than the ion temperature ( @xmath253 ) in such a low density , high temperature region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , cooling via the synchrotron emission and the inverse - compton effect can be efficient .",
    "by contrast , the electron temperature and the ion temperature coincide ( @xmath254 ) in low temperature and high density disks such as optically thick low-@xmath1 disks , standard disks , and slim disks . in subsequent papers",
    ", we will take into account the decoupling of ions and electrons in the low density , high temperature region and incorporate the synchrotron emission and the inverse - compton effect , in addition to the bremsstrahlung emission as the cooling mechanism .",
    "we obtained solutions for the optically thick low-@xmath1 disks emitting blackbody radiation ( panel ( f ) in figure [ disks ] ) .",
    "the radial distribution of the effective temperature in the optically thick low-@xmath1 disk is roughly the same as that for the standard disk ( @xmath255 ) because it does not depend on whether the gas pressure or the magnetic pressure is dominant as long as the heating rate balances the blackbody cooling .",
    "this indicates that the optically thick low-@xmath1 disk will be observed as a thermal disk .",
    "the seed photons incident on the compton corona ( the low density , high temperature region , that is , the adaf / riaf or the optically thin low-@xmath1 region ) have been thought to be provided by a cool disk or by synchrotron emissions .",
    "the optically thick low-@xmath1 disk can also be the source of seed photons . when @xmath256 , the adaf / riaf undergoes a transition to the optically thick low-@xmath1 disk from the radially outer region as the mass accretion rate increases .",
    "thus , the inner adaf / riaf region is surrounded by the outer optically thick low-@xmath1 disk ( panel ( g ) in figure [ disks ] ) .",
    "an increase in seed photons can result in a decrease in the temperature of the compton corona .",
    "furthermore , the hard x - rays comptonized in the corona can be incident on the optically thick low-@xmath1 disk and can be partly reflected . as a result",
    ", the existence of such region will enhance the compton continua with a reflection component in the x - ray spectrum .    to sum up",
    ", the optically thick low-@xmath1 disk not only provides seed photons to the compton corona but also produces a soft spectral excess and a reflection component observed in the low / hard state of cyg x-1 @xcite and gro j1655 - 40 @xcite at the suzaku x - ray observatory .",
    "so far , we have focused on the hard - to - soft transition of bhcs .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this object frequently exhibits state transitions and quasi - regular x - ray flares .",
    "it has been thought that the latter effect may be driven by limit cycle oscillations between the standard disk and the slim disk ( panel ( a ) @xmath257 ( b ) in figure [ disks ] ) .",

    "* ) approximation for the radiation transfer and the phenomenological @xmath21 viscosity for the angular momentum transfer and the viscous heating .",
    "however , such rhd simulations do not follow the formation of the low-@xmath1 disk presented in this paper .",
    "we first consider a transition from a slim disk to an optically thick low-@xmath1 disk .",
    "we suppose that the disk is initially in the slim disk state in which magnetic heating balances the heat advection ( the photon trapping ) and that these are greater than the radiative cooling ( @xmath258 ) .",
    "figure [ x005al05sifoo ] shows that as the mass accretion rate decreases , the slim disk branches disappear . at this point ,",
    "the magnetic heating ( and the heat advection ) become less than the radiative cooling ( @xmath259 ) .",

    "the disk shrinks in the vertical direction along the cooling timescale and undergoes a transition to an optically thick low-@xmath1 disk ( panel ( e ) @xmath251 ( f ) in figure [ disks ] ) .",
    "this situation is similar to the transition from the adaf / riaf to the optically thin low-@xmath1 disk found by @xcite .",
    "subsequently , as the mass accretion rate increases , the disk undergoes a transition back to a slim disk because the optically thick low-@xmath1 branches disappear ( panel ( f ) @xmath251 ( e ) in figure [ disks ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that an optically thick low-@xmath1 disk undergoes a transition to a slim disk at higher mass accretion rates ( @xmath260 for @xmath261 and @xmath233 ) than those at which a standard disk undergoes a transition to a slim disk ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "this results in a small variation in luminosity for quasi - regular x - ray flares compared to that expected from the limit cycle between a standard disk and a slim disk .",
    "we have obtained low-@xmath1 solutions for optically thin and optically thick disks incorporating the mean azimuthal magnetic fields .",
    "the key assumptions are ( 1 ) we prescribed the maxwell stress to be proportional to the total ( gas , radiation , and magnetic ) pressure , and ( 2 ) we specified the magnetic flux advection rate instead of the plasma @xmath1 at each radius . as a result , the strong magnetic fields mainly contribute to the heating and increase the half thickness of the disk . in the low-@xmath1 disks , the heating enhanced by strong magnetic pressure balances the radiative cooling rather than the heat advection .",
    "optically thin low-@xmath1 disks explain the bright hard state undergoing the bright / slow transition observed in bhcs .",
    "the optically thick low-@xmath1 disk can be observed as a thermal disk , which can supply seed photons into the compton corona ( the adaf / riaf or the optically thin low-@xmath1 region ) and reflect incident photons from the compton corona .",
