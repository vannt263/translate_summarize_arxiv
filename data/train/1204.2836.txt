    ".    @xcite report on _ rosat _ , _ asca _ , _ einstein _ , _ swift _ , and _ xmm - newton _ observations of the region . while igr  j110146103 was the target for _ swift _ , the other satellites observed the region in order to study the supernova remnant msh  1161a ( snr  g290.100.8 ) . from the x - ray observations ,",

    "@xcite also search optical / ir , radio , and gamma - ray catalogs for counterparts , and they report a possible association with the radio source mgps-2 j110149610104 , which has a flux of @xmath4mjy at 843mhz .",
    "they suggest that igr  j110146103 may be a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) produced by a high - velocity pulsar but conclude that x - ray observations with better angular resolution are required to establish the nature of the source .    here , we report results of an observation with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , which provides the improved angular resolution .",
    "a _ chandra _ observation of igr  j110146103 occurred on 2011 september 6 ( obsid 12420 ) . we used the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis , * ? ? ? * ) as the detector with the _ integral _ position of igr  j110146103 at the acis - i aimpoint .",
    "the observation started at 1.43hr ut , and a net exposure time of 4,991s was obtained .",
    "the data were initially processed at the _ chandra _ x - ray center ( cxc ) with ascds version 8.4 . after obtaining the data from the cxc",
    ", we performed all subsequent processing with the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) version 4.3.1 software and calibration data base ( caldb ) version 4.4.6 .",
    "we used the ciao program chandra_repro to produce the `` level 2 '' event lists , which we analyzed as described below .",
    "an inspection of the 0.310kev acis image indicates the presence of the complex source that was previously reported , and the point source ( ps ) and north - east ( ne ) extension are , by far , the brightest sources in the field - of - view .",
    "figure  [ fig : j11014 ] shows ne in far more detail than in previous observations , indicating that the emission may , in fact , have a conical or cometary shape with its narrow end close to ps .",

    "the _ chandra _ position is @xmath10 away , which rules out the association .",
    "furthermore , we searched all of the source catalogs available in the vizier database with a search radius of @xmath11 , and the _ xmm - newton _ source is the only one that appears .",
    "finally , we obtained near - ir images from 2mass and optical images from the digitized sky survey .",
    "although there is no evidence for near - ir or optical sources at the _ chandra _ position of ps , the nearby 2mass source is relatively bright ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , making it difficult to obtain precise upper limits on the near - ir and optical brightnesses without higher quality images .",

    "figure  [ fig : rprofile ] shows that ps is consistent with being a point source .",
    "in fact , the simulated profile is slightly higher than the measurements for ps , and this is likely due to inaccuracies within chart or marx as has also been found by @xcite .",
    "we extracted an energy spectrum for ps using the ciao program specextract .",

    "we produced profiles of the counts along the long axis of the rectangle in two energy bands , 0.310kev and 210kev . while the number of 210kev counts is close to half the number in the full energy band , the profiles are not significantly different",

    "the length of the tail is several arcminutes , and it is nearly perpendicular to the ne extension .",
    "we searched for pulsations from igr  j110146103 on 2011 july 27 using the csiro parkes radio telescope .",
    "we obtained a 5.6hr observation with the 1.4ghz multibeam receiver and sampled every 1ms each of the 96 frequency channels spanning 288mhz of bandwidth ( for further data acquisition details , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we analyzed the data following standard pulsar search techniques using presto @xcite , but did not identify a convincing pulsar candidate .",
    "we dedispersed the data up to @xmath37pc@xmath38 , which is twice the maximum predicted in this direction by the @xcite model for the galactic distribution of free electrons .",
    "the sensitivity limit of this observation , assuming a pulsar duty cycle of 10% , is @xmath39mjy , corresponding to a luminosity ( @xmath40 ) limit of @xmath410.05mjykpc@xmath42 at a distance of 1kpc and @xmath415mjykpc@xmath42 at @xmath43kpc .",
    "if the source is at the larger distance , the non - detection is not surprising since approximately half of all young pulsars detected in the radio have luminosities below 5mjykpc@xmath42 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the results presented above are consistent with ( but do not prove ) the hypothesis that ps is a pulsar .",
    "position shows that the source does not have a bright optical / ir counterpart , which is consistent with a pulsar since isolated neutron stars are very faint in the optical and ir .",
    "the stability of the long - term flux and the power - law spectrum are also expected if the source is a pulsar .",
    "the _ chandra _ observation provides new information about the ne extension and its relationship to ps . in the scenario where ps is a pulsar , the natural explanation for ne is that it is a pwn as suggested by @xcite .",
    "for some pwne , a bow shock is created due to the motion of the pulsar through the ism . in the case of igr",
    "j110146103 , the morphology of ne suggests that the pulsar may be moving in the south - west direction at high speed .",
    "figure  [ fig : msh ] provides evidence in favor of this interpretation as it shows that ne is elongated in a direction that is co - aligned with ps and the center of the snr msh  1161a .",
    "thus , a strong possibility is that the compact object that is powering igr  j110146103 was produced when the supernova occurred .",
    "msh  1161a has a centrally bright x - ray morphology , but the location of the compact object produced in the supernova is unknown .",
    "the x - ray emission from the snr is thermal rather than being powered by a pwn @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that psr  j11056107 , which is @xmath44 from the center of the snr , may be associated with msh  1161a @xcite .",
    "applying snr evolution models to msh  1161a , @xcite argue that the snr is ( 12)@xmath45yr old and is at a distance of 811kpc .",
    "the thermal conduction and cloudy ism models would imply transverse velocities for psr  j11056107 of 4,500 and 5,300kms@xmath0 , respectively @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the known distribution of pulsar velocities includes groups near 175kms@xmath0 and 700kms@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the fastest pulsar with parallax and proper motion measurements has a velocity of 1,100kms@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "although there is evidence for pulsar or compact object velocities in excess of 1,100kms@xmath0 @xcite , @xmath461,000kms@xmath0 @xcite , and @xmath461,400kms@xmath0 @xcite , the velocities implied by an association between psr  j11056107 and msh  1161a are likely too high .",
    "igr  j110146103 is @xmath47 from the center of msh  1161a , and scaling from the calculations previously carried out for psr  j11056107 , we determine transverse velocities of 2,400 and 2,900kms@xmath0 for the thermal conduction and cloudy ism models , respectively , if igr  j110146103 was formed in the supernova event that produced msh  1161a . among known compact objects associated with snrs , these values are only rivaled by the recent estimate of 1,4002,600kms@xmath0 for xmmu  j172054.5372652 @xcite . thus , these two cases indicate that supernova models that can produce @xmath462,000kms@xmath0 kick velocities may be required .      if the interpretation that igr  j110146103 is a pwn and that ne is emission from a bow shock is correct , then the fact that ps is a point source along with the morphology of ne provide a constraint on the angular distance between the pulsar and the standoff shock , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the standoff shock radius , @xmath50 is the inclination angle of the pulsar velocity with respect to the plane of the sky , and @xmath51 is the distance to the source .",
    "the standoff shock location is set by the ram pressure balance between the pulsar wind and the pulsar passing through the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the shape of the entire bow shock in space is determined by @xmath49 according to @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the angle with respect to the direction of motion , and @xmath54 is the distance to the shock along each angle @xcite . while the observed shape of the bow shock will depend on @xmath50 , here",
    ", we make a rough estimate for @xmath55 using the @xmath56 case . figure  [ fig : profile]b compares the calculated shape of the bow shock to the _ chandra _ data for three values of @xmath55 .",
    "the data are best described by a value close to @xmath34 , and the lower and upper limits are approximately @xmath57 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , we derive @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the transverse velocity of the pulsar in units of @xmath60kms@xmath0 , @xmath61 is the distance to the pulsar in units of 10kpc , @xmath62 is the rotational energy loss of the pulsar in units of @xmath63ergs@xmath0 , and @xmath64 is the particle density of the ism near the source in units of 0.1@xmath38 .    from",
    "the spectral fits described above , the 0.310kev unabsorbed flux of ps and ne combined is @xmath65erg@xmath20s@xmath0 , which corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath66 @xmath67ergs@xmath0 , and as @xmath68 is the radiative efficiency of the pwn , @xmath69 .",
    "we obtain another constraint by considering that if ne is a pwn , then the emission has a synchrotron origin and will decay as the electrons age on a time scale of @xmath70 , where this is the exponential e - folding time for the x - ray flux in units of @xmath60yr .",
    "thus , the @xmath1@xmath71 transverse length of ne implies that @xmath72 , and the expression for the standoff shock radius becomes @xmath73 a significant caveat is that the synchrotron lifetime constraint assumes that any velocity imparted to electrons in the pwn by the pulsar is small relative to the pulsar space velocity .",
    "if ne has a magnetotail component @xcite , then the ejection velocities could be high enough to invalidate this assumption @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : pspace ] shows the distance-@xmath55 parameter space for the case of @xmath36 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 for several different values of @xmath68 that span values measured for @xmath160 pwn @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath74 is obtained in the @xcite study , and it is what would be predicted for a @xmath110@xmath76 g magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath75 is consistent with the intercloud ism density found in the vicinity of msh  1161a using the cloudy ism model @xcite .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "constraints on @xmath55 suggest a value of @xmath77 if the distance is @xmath12kpc and values of @xmath78@xmath79 if the distance is @xmath110kpc .",
    "although we can not use this information to formally constrain the distance , the larger distance is slightly favored since pwne with @xmath80@xmath81 are much more common than pwne with larger radiative efficiencies @xcite .    ) , if ne is indeed a bow shock . from the _ chandra _ image , we find that values of @xmath55 between @xmath57 and @xmath11 are allowed ( for @xmath36 ) .",
    "the solid lines show the calculated values for a range of pulsar efficiencies ( @xmath68 ) for the case where @xmath36 , @xmath75 , and @xmath74.[fig : pspace ] ]      whether igr  j110146103 is related to msh  1161a or not , if ps is a pulsar moving in a south - west direction as implied by ne being a bow shock , then the x - ray tail extends @xmath1@xmath82 in a direction that is @xmath1perpendicular to the motion of the pulsar .",
    "a chance alignment seems unlikely , especially since similar x - ray tails have been seen from other pwne .",
    "examples include the guitar nebula ( psr  b2224 + 65 ) and psr  j0357 + 3205 , which have @xmath83 and @xmath84 x - ray tails @xcite .",
    "the guitar nebula is noteworthy because its x - ray tail points in a direction that is @xmath85 from the measured proper motion direction for this pulsar @xcite .",
    "while these examples support the pwn nature of igr  j110146103 as discussed by @xcite and also the possibility that the igr  j110146103 x - ray tail may extend in a direction perpendicular to the pulsar s direction of motion , it is worth pointing out that the size of the x - ray tail may be an argument against a @xmath110kpc distance .",
    "while the x - ray tails for the other pulsars have lengths near 1pc , a 10kpc distance for igr  j110146103 would imply a @xmath110  pc length for the x - ray tail from this source .",
    "this work provides further evidence that igr  j110146103 is a pwn .",
    "the _ chandra _ position for ps eliminates the previously suggested 2mass counterpart , and the available near - ir and optical images do not indicate the presence of another counterpart , which is consistent with the faint levels of optical / ir emission expected from a pulsar .",
    "most significantly , the _ chandra _ observation has provided new information about the morphology of the extended source to the north - east of ps ( called ne in this work ) , and we argue that the most likely interpretation is that ne is shaped by a bow shock caused by ps moving in the south - west direction at a high rate of speed .    given the alignment of ps , ne , and the supernova remnant msh  1161a , we suggest the possibility that igr  j110146103 is a pulsar that was formed by the supernova event that produced msh  1161a . if correct , this would imply that igr  j110146103 is at the same distance as the snr , 811  kpc , and also that the supernova imparted a kick velocity of at least 2,4002,900kms@xmath0 .",
    "while we show that the _ chandra _ constraint on the standoff shock makes a scenario with a large distance and a high velocity plausible , caution is required due to uncertainties about the nature of the source , its orientation in space ( @xmath50 ) , and its environment . one possible counterargument to igr  j110146103 having a distance compatible with the snr is that this would imply a 10pc - long x - ray tail .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with j.  halpern , v.  kaspi , and s.  boggs .",
