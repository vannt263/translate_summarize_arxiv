    "> from several points of view it looks appealing to study processes with two large rapidity gaps in high energy hadron collisions . applications of such processes , generated , for example , by pomeron - pomeron  collisions , embrace both searches for new physics ( such as the higgs boson ) and dedicated analyses of conventional physics , including the investigation of subtle aspects of qcd .",
    "the attractiveness of the approach is motivated by the spectacularly clean experimental signatures and the possibility to clearly differentiate between different production mechanisms .",
    "events with large rapidity gaps may be selected either by using a calorimeter or by detecting leading protons with beam momentum fractions @xmath7 close to 1 .",
    "if the momenta of the leading protons can be measured with very high accuracy then a particle ( or system ) produced by the double - diffractive mechanism may be observed as a peak in the spectrum of the missing - mass ( @xmath8 ) distribution .",
    "indeed , it has recently been proposed to search for the higgs boson by measuring the outgoing fast proton and antiproton in run ii of the tevatron with extremely good precision corresponding to a missing - mass resolution @xmath9 @xcite . to ascertain whether the sought after higgs signal can be seen , it is crucial to evaluate the background . recall that the inclusive search for an intermediate mass higgs , that is @xmath10 or @xmath11 with @xmath12 , has an extremely small signal - to - background ratio , which makes this process impossible to observe .    in section  2",
    "we briefly recall the qcd mechanism for the double - diffractive production of a system of large invariant mass @xmath8 .",
    "we use this formalism in section  3 to study the background for double - diffractive @xmath12 production , and to show that the signal - to - background ratio can be estimated in a practically model - independent way .",
    "then in section  4 we discuss double - diffractive production of @xmath3 ( and @xmath2 ) mesons .",
    "we present their expected cross sections at the tevatron . in section  5",
    "we discuss another attractive possibility .",
    "that is , to use the double - diffractive production of a dijet system as a gluon factory , which generates huge numbers of essentially pure gluon jets in a clean environment . in section  6",
    "we emphasize that a high - resolution missing - mass measurement on its own may not yield a sharp peak for a rare process , if care is not taken to account for qed radiation .",
    "finally , in section  7 , we present our conclusions .",
    "we wish to estimate the cross section for high energy reactions of the type [ eq : a1 ] pp p + m + p , and similarly for @xmath13 , where the plus  signs indicate the presence of large rapidity gaps . to be precise , we calculate the rate for the double - diffractive exclusive production of a system of large invariant mass @xmath8 , for example , a higgs boson . in all models @xcite@xcite the amplitude for the double - diffractive process",
    "is described by fig .  1 , where the hard subprocess @xmath14 is initiated by gluon - gluon fusion and the second @xmath15-channel gluon is needed to screen the colour flow across the rapidity gap intervals .",
    "in other words the pomeron is modelled by two - gluon exchange .",
    "one major difference between the various theoretical approaches concerns the specification of the exchange gluons .",
    "_ either _ non - perturbative gluons are used in which the propagator is modified so as to reproduce the total cross section @xcite , _ or _",
    "a perturbative qcd estimate is made @xcite using an unintegrated , skewed gluon density that is determined from conventional gluons obtained in global parton analyses .",
    "however it has been emphasized @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the non- perturbative normalisation based on the value of the elastic or total cross section fixes the diagonal gluon density at @xmath16 where the transverse momentum @xmath17 is small , namely @xmath18 .",
    "thus the value of @xmath19 is even smaller than [ eq : a2 ] x^ x , where the variables are defined in fig .  1 .",
    "however , the gluon density grows as @xmath20 and so the use of a non - perturbative normalisation will lead to an overestimation of double - diffractive cross sections .",
    "of course the fusion of the two energetic gluons into the high mass state in fig .  1",
    "is generally accompanied by the emission of soft gluons which may populate the rapidity gaps . the basic mechanism to suppress this effect is shown in fig .  1 , where the second @xmath15-channel gluon , which screens the colour , does not couple to the produced state of mass @xmath8 and has typical values of @xmath21 which are much smaller than @xmath8 but yet are large enough ( for sufficiently large @xmath8 ) to screen soft gluon emission and to justify the applicability of perturbative qcd .",
    "recently the @xmath22 cross section has been calculated to single @xmath23 accuracy @xcite .",
    "the amplitude is [ eq : b2 ] m = a ^3 f_g ( x_1 , x_1^ , q_t^2 , m_h^2/4 ) f_g ( x_2 , x_2^ , q_t^2 , m_h^2/4 ) , where the @xmath24 vertex factor @xmath25 is given by ( [ eq : a4 ] ) below , and the unintegrated gluon densities are related to the conventional distributions by [ eq : c2 ] f_g ( x , x^ , q_t^2 , m_h^2/4 ) = r_g .",
    "the factor @xmath26 is the ratio of the skewed @xmath27 integrated gluon distribution to the conventional one .",
    "@xmath28 at lhc ( tevatron ) energies .",
    "the bremsstrahlung survival probability @xmath29 is given by [ eq : d2 ] t ( q_t , ) = ( - _ q_t^2^^2 _ 0 ^ 1 - k_t/ dz ) , and strongly suppresses the infrared contribution to the @xmath21 integration of ( [ eq : b2 ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath30 arises in ( [ eq : c2 ] ) because the survival probability is only relevant to the hard gluon exchanges in fig .  1 .",
    "in addition to this suppression due to the probability @xmath29  that the @xmath31 rapidity gaps survive population by extra gluons from the hard process , we must also include the probability @xmath32 that the gaps are not filled by secondaries produced in soft rescattering between the protons , that is by an underlying interaction .",
    "we estimate the @xmath33 event rate at the tevatron in section  3.3 .",
    "to use the missing - mass  method to search for an intermediate mass higgs boson , via the @xmath12 decay mode , we have to estimate the qcd background which arises from the production of a pair of jets with invariant mass about @xmath34 .",
    "if we assume that the higgs boson is produced by the @xmath24 fusion mechanism then the signal - to - background ratio is just given by the ratio of the appropriate matrix elements squared for the @xmath24 and @xmath35  dijet subprocesses .",
    "we begin by considering the double - diffractive colour - singlet production of a pair of high @xmath36 gluons with rapidities @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath39 subprocess cross section is @xcite [ eq : a3 ] & = & + & & + & = & ( - ) ^- , where @xmath8 is the invariant mass of the dijet system , @xmath40 is the transverse momentum of the jets , and @xmath41 is the jet rapidity difference .",
    "note that , since the outgoing proton and antiproton are at small angles relevant to the respective beams , @xmath42 .    the background ( [ eq : a3 ] ) should be compared to the double - diffractive @xmath43 signal [ eq : a4 ] = g_f _ s^2 g_f _ s^2 , where @xmath44 is the fermi coupling and @xmath45",
    "since we assume @xmath34 lies well below the @xmath46 threshold . here",
    "we use the framework and the notation of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "immediately we see a problem .",
    "the small @xmath40 divergence of the dijet cross section , ( [ eq : a3 ] ) , means that the background will be huge if just a missing - mass measurement on its own is performed .",
    "we thus also require a central detector to impose a jet @xmath47 cut .",
    "with such an additional detector we may select events with jets , say , with @xmath48 .",
    "in other words we trigger on double - diffractive events containing a pair of jets with angles @xmath49 from the beam direction in the higgs rest frame . for a scalar higgs boson",
    "this cut kills one half of the events , whereas the dijet cross section ( [ eq : a3 ] ) is reduced to [ eq : a5 ] = _ 3m^2/16^m^2/4 ( - ) ^- = 9.73 . with the same scale in the couplings @xmath50 in ( [ eq : a4 ] ) and ( [ eq : a5 ] ) , and neglecting the nlo corrections - factor",
    "is expected to be about the same , or a little larger , than that for higgs production . ]",
    ", we obtain the signal - to - background ratio [ eq : a6 ] & = & ( h b|b ) + & & + & & ( 4.3 10 ^ -3 ) ( h b|b ) ( ) ^3 ( ) . the factor @xmath51 accounts for the branching ratio of the @xmath12 decay and the @xmath49 cut of the low @xmath40 jets .",
    "( the @xmath12 branching ratio is about 0.7 if @xmath52 . )",
    "the ratio @xmath53 appears too small for the above approach to provide a viable signal for the higgs boson .",
    "however the situation is greatly improved if we are able to identify the @xmath1 and @xmath54 jets .",
    "if we assume that there is only a 1% chance to misidentify a gluon jet as a @xmath1 jet , then tagging _ both _ @xmath1 and @xmath54 will suppress the gluon background by @xmath55 . in this case",
    "only the true @xmath56 background will pose a problem .      for the double - diffractive central production of a @xmath56 pair ,",
    "the @xmath57 signal/@xmath56 background ratio is much larger than that of section  3.1 . here",
    "the ratio is strongly enhanced due to the colour factors , gluon polarisation selection and the spin @xmath58 nature of the quarks .",
    "first , the cross sections for inclusive colour - singlet dijet production are @xcite [ eq : a7 ] ( gg gg ) & = & ( 1 - ) ^2 + & & + ( gg b|b ) & & ( 1 - ) . since @xmath59 the @xmath56 background is suppressed relative to the @xmath60 background by [ eq : a8 ] < < 10 ^ -2 .",
    "moreover , we emphasize that for the exclusive process the initial @xmath60 state obeys special selection rules .",
    "besides being a colour - singlet , for forward outgoing protons the projection of the total angular momentum is @xmath61 along the beam axis - channel gluons by the protons , include leading order bfkl or dglap ladders . ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the born amplitude for light fermion pair production , with forward outgoing protons , the cancellation was first observed by pumplin @xcite , see also @xcite . ]",
    "vanishes in this @xmath61 state , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "this result follows from @xmath62- and @xmath63-invariance and fermion helicity conservation of the @xmath61 amplitude @xcite .",
    "thus , if we were to neglect the @xmath1-quark mass @xmath64 , then at leading order we would have no qcd @xmath56-dijet background at all . even beyond lo , the interference between the signal and background amplitudes is negligibly small , since they have different helicity structure .",
    "therefore the form of the peak , observed in double- diffractive exclusive @xmath12 production , will not be affected by interference with @xmath56 jets produced by the pure qcd background process .",
    "of course , a non - vanishing @xmath56 rate is predicted when we allow for the quark mass or if we emit an extra gluon .",
    "nevertheless in the former case we still have an additional suppression to ( [ eq : a8 ] ) of about a factor of @xmath65 , whereas in the latter case the extra suppression is about @xmath66 .",
    "note that events containing the third ( gluon ) jet may be experimentally separated from higgs decay , where the two jets are dominantly co - planar collisions , which was studied in detail in @xcite . ] .",
    "up to now we have discussed forward outgoing protons in the idealized case where their transverse momenta @xmath67 . in reality",
    "there is a strong correlation between these transverse momenta . in particular",
    ", it implies that factorization ( whereby the cross section is a product of pomeron emission factors multiplied by the pomeron - pomeron fusion subprocess ) is not valid @xcite .",
    "it is thus remarkable that the suppression of the double - diffractive @xmath56 dijet production ( the qcd background process ) is still valid for non - zero @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "indeed , the polarization vectors @xmath70 of the hard   gluons in fig .",
    "1 are directed along @xmath71 , where @xmath72 denotes the two transverse components of the momenta . in the case where we neglected @xmath73 and averaged over the direction of @xmath74 we obtained the polarization tensor [ eq : b8 ] _ j _ k ~",
    "q_j q_k ~ _ jk^(2 ) , which corresponds to the @xmath61 di - gluon state",
    ". however , for non - zero @xmath75 the tensor becomes [ eq : c8 ] _ j _ k ~ ( q + q_1)_j ( q + q_2)_k ~ _ jk^(2 ) + q_1j q_2k .",
    "the linear term in @xmath21 vanishes after the @xmath74 angular integration . in this way we obtain an admixture of @xmath76 di - gluon states , which leads to a contribution of the order of @xmath77 to the @xmath78 cross section .",
    "thus the integral over the @xmath21 loop in the amplitude ( that is the dijet counterpart to ( [ eq : b2 ] ) ) becomes less infrared safe .",
    "however the sudakov - like form factor ( [ eq : d2 ] ) and the effective anomalous dimension , @xmath79 , of the gluon @xmath80 still suppress the contribution from the infrared domain @xcite .",
    "if we use the mrs gluon @xcite , we find the integral typically samples @xmath21 values in the region @xmath81 at the tevatron ( lhc ) energy .",
    "thus the @xmath82 admixture does not contribute more than 5% ( 1.5% ) of the dijet cross section ; here we take a mean @xmath83 of 400  mev .",
    "of course the @xmath82 contribution may be suppressed by selecting forward protons with smaller @xmath83 .",
    "so finally we see that identifying the @xmath12 signal allows the background to be suppressed by more than a factor 3000 .",
    "the signal is thus in excess of the background , even for a mass resolution of @xmath84 .",
    "there is therefore an opportunity to see a clear peak at @xmath85 , _ provided _ the cross section for double - diffractive higgs production is large enough",
    ".      the cross section for double - diffractive higgs production at tevatron and lhc energies has been calculated by several authors @xcite . if our recent perturbative qcd determination @xcite is updated to incorporate the latest rapidity gap survival probability estimates at @xmath86 and @xmath87 at @xmath88 .",
    "] of ref .",
    "@xcite , then [ eq : a9 ] _ h ( p|p p + h + |p ) 0.06 = 2  tev for a higgs boson of mass 120  gev . note that the value of cross section ( [ eq : a9 ] ) is comparable to the cross section generated by the @xmath89 fusion subprocess . recall that this qed contribution comes from large impact parameters , where the corresponding gap survival probability @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "@xmath91 is estimated to be about 0.03  fb at @xmath92 and 0.3  fb at @xmath88 .",

    "however it may be checked experimentally , since exactly the same mechanism , and calculation , is relevant to double - diffractive dijet production .",
    "indeed , double - diffractive dijet production , for jets with @xmath94 , has been studied by cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "they find an upper limit for the cross section , @xmath95 , as compared to our prediction of about @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "using the dijet process as a monitor thus rules out the much larger predictions for @xmath97 which exist in the literature .",
    "unfortunately the prediction @xmath98 of ( [ eq : a9 ] ) means that run ii of the tevatron , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath99 , should yield less than an event .",
    "we should add that the double - diffractive higgs search can also be made in the @xmath100 and @xmath101 decay channels @xcite , but , due to the small branching ratios , then the event rate is even less .    on the other hand , the cross section @xmath102 , calculated in the perturbative qcd approach @xcite , grows with energy and at @xmath88 reaches @xmath103 ( corresponding to @xmath104 at @xmath105 ) .",
    "in fact , if we were to ignore the rapidity gap survival probability , @xmath32 , then @xmath102 would have increased by more than a factor of 100 in going from @xmath106 to @xmath88 .",
    "however at larger energies the probability to produce secondaries which populate the gap increases and so @xmath107 increases only by a factor of 40 .",
    "nevertheless there is a real chance to observe double - diffractive higgs production at the lhc , since both the cross section and the luminosity are much larger than at the tevatron .",
    "of course , the missing - mass method may be used , not only for higgs searches , but for many other double - diffractive exclusive reactions .",
    "particularly relevant examples are the production of scalar @xmath109 @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons @xcite .",
    "these processes will allow another check , albeit qualitative , of our perturbative qcd techniques has been calculated for a range of diffractive processes in , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite . ] for calculating double - diffractive processes @xcite .",
    "in addition there are two reasons why @xmath108 production processes are of interest in their own right .",
    "first , the production of @xmath108 mesons with a rapidity gap on either side ensures the selection of pure colour - singlet states , so there can be no admixture from a colour - octet production mechanism .",
    "this should illuminate the dynamics of the hadroproduction of mesons containing heavy quarks .",
    "second , the data on inclusive @xmath56 production at the tevatron lies about a factor of 3 above the conventional nlo qcd prediction .",
    "a measurement of @xmath3 diffractive production is thus of interest .",
    "as mentioned above , the cross section for double - diffractive @xmath108 meson production may be calculated by the same perturbative qcd approach that was applied to higgs and dijet production @xcite .",
    "the @xmath110 vertex is given in terms of the width of the @xmath108 meson .",
    "we assume @xmath111 , with an observed width of @xmath112  mev @xcite for the @xmath113 meson .",
    "for @xmath114 we used the qcd lattice result @xcite for the leading order @xmath115 width of 354  kev . to be more precise",
    ", we included the standard nlo correction @xmath116 for @xmath114 , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "we assume that the amplitude for @xmath108 production behaves as [ eq : a10 ] m e^b ( t_1 + t_2)/2 with slope @xmath117 , where @xmath118 are the momentum transfer squared at the proton ( antiproton ) vertices .",
    "for @xmath86 we take the rapidity gap survival probability to be @xmath119 @xcite . with these input values ,",
    "the double - diffractive cross sections estimated for run ii of the tevatron are [ eq : a11 ] ( _ c ( 0^++ ) ) & & 600  nb , + & & + ( _ b ( 0^++ ) ) & & 110  pb . the corresponding rapidity distributions @xmath120 are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "note that the double - diffractive production of exclusive axial vector ( @xmath121 ) and tensor @xmath122 quarkonium states are strongly suppressed and @xmath123 quarkonium production was recently pointed out by f.  yuan @xcite who used a non - relativistic formula for the evaluation of @xmath62-wave quarkonium decays .",
    "the former results from the landau - yang theorem @xcite which forbids the @xmath124 transition for massless gluons .",
    "the latter is directly related to the helicity - zero selection rule which we have discussed above .",
    "it was known for a long time that in the non - relativistic limit the @xmath61 amplitude for the @xmath125 decay of the @xmath123 @xmath126 positronium state vanishes @xcite .",
    "this , of course , remains valid for the helicity - zero transition of a heavy tensor quarkonium state into two gluons @xcite .    in reality",
    ", exclusive tensor @xmath108-meson production will occur due to corrections caused by relativistic effects ( which are expected to be numerically small @xcite ) , as well as by the off - mass - shell corrections to the helicity - zero transition and by the admixture of @xmath82 di - gluon states , which we explained in section  3.2 .",
    "the largest contribution is expected from non - forward corrections , arising from the second term on the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : c8 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath127 rate may therefore be as large as the fraction @xmath128 of the @xmath129 production cross sections of ( [ eq : a11 ] ) . as a consequence we anticipate a decrease of the @xmath127 cross section in the very forward region .",
    "note that the @xmath61 selection rule becomes redundant for _ inclusive _ double - diffractive processes , so , for example , @xmath123 @xmath108-production will become more significant .    of course",
    "the estimates of double - diffractive @xmath108 production are much less infrared stable than those for higgs production .",
    "for example ,",
    "using grv partons @xcite down to @xmath130 , rather than mrs partons @xcite with frozen anomalous dimension for @xmath131 , to calculate the gluon loop contribution at low virtuality is approximately independent of whether grv or mrs partons are used . ] , enlarges the cross section by about a factor of 3 for @xmath3 , and even larger for @xmath2 .",
    "it is known that the grv gluon is rather too large in this domain .",
    "however the comparison does demonstrate the infrared sensitivity of the estimates , which for such low mass particles should only be considered as an indication of the size of the cross section .",
    "nevertheless the @xmath108 cross sections are huge . for an integrated luminosity of @xmath132 in run ii of the tevatron we expect about @xmath133 events with a large rapidity gap on either side of the meson .",
    "the high event rate and the remarkable purity of the di - gluon system , that is generated in the exclusive double - diffractive production process , provides a unique facility at a photon linear collider could also allow an experimental study of gluon jets via the process @xmath134 in the @xmath135 initial state . ]",
    "environment to make detailed studies of high energy gluon jets .",
    "indeed we may speak of a gluon factory , since , as discussed in section 3.2 , double - diffractive quark di - jet production is strongly suppressed ( by the @xmath61 selection rule ) .",
    "recall that a precise comparison of quark and gluon jets requires that the two isolated gluon jets are produced from a point - like colour - singlet state subprocess to a hadronic reaction .",
    "in many cases this approach could be misleading since the @xmath60 events do not originate from a pure colour - singlet system .",
    "the interference between emissions from incoming and outgoing gluons leads to coherence effects which can strongly affect the final hadronic system , see , for example , @xcite . ]",
    " the counterpart of the celebrated @xmath136 process  see @xcite for recent reviews .",
    "note that for qcd studies of gluon jets , the requirement of high resolution on the dijet mass is not essential .",
    "based on the estimates performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we expect , for example , about @xmath137 events per day with @xmath138 , at the lhc , assuming a luminosity of @xmath139/day and neglecting corrections for acceptance and efficiency . this number should be compared with the present experimental studies of the so - called unbiased gluon jets performed by the opal collaboration at lep1 @xcite . here",
    "gluon jets are identified in double - tagged @xmath140 events . over about five years of running only 439 pure gluon events",
    "were identified .",
    "at first sight it looks attractive to use the missing - mass approach to search for ( non - standard model ) higgs bosons which decay into invisible modes , such as gravitinos , neutralinos or gravitons .",
    "the possibility of observing such an invisible higgs in inclusive processes at the lhc was discussed recently in ref .",
    "indeed in the exclusive channel , @xmath141 , one should observe just two outgoing protons and nothing else but a sharp peak in the missing - mass distribution .",
    "unfortunately it is not clear how accurately it is possible to eliminate the background caused , for example , by qed radiation from the protons , or maybe even from radiative decays of low mass proton excitations .",
    "the problem is that the probability to lose some energy by radiating photons of energy @xmath142 in the interval @xmath143 is of order @xmath144 @xcite , where @xmath83 is the transverse momentum of the outgoing proton of mass @xmath145 .",
    "therefore the cross section for @xmath146 , which may mimic a missing - mass event , is about [ eq : b11 ] .",
    "|_y = 0 ~ ( ) ^2 ( ) _ el ~ 0.8  pb , where we have assumed @xmath147 , and taken @xmath148 and @xmath149 at lhc energies .",
    "this is huge in comparison to the cross section @xmath150 for @xmath151 .",
    "of course some of the qed radiation may be detected by an additional dedicated forward electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "also it is necessary to allow for the radiative tail which will spread out the shape of the higgs peak .",
    "this illustrates a basic problem in searching for _ rare _ processes using _ high - resolution _ missing - mass measurements which observe _ only _ the forward protons .",
    "there will always be the possibility that part of the proton energy will escape undetected down , or near , the beam pipe .",
    "of course this deficiency would not exist if we were able to measure the products of the rare process with sufficient accuracy to confirm that their invariant mass coincides with the missing - mass measurement .",
    "in this case the main purpose of the forward proton missing - mass detector would be to considerably improve the @xmath152 resolution .",
    "for the gluon factory there is no problem , since high resolution is not essential and the event rate is enormous .",
    "the missing - mass detector is used just to select large rapidity gap events .",
    "similarly there is no problem for double - diffractive @xmath108 meson production if the various decay modes are observed .",
    "we have studied the proposal of triggering on forward going protons and antiprotons to perform a high resolution missing - mass search for the higgs boson at the tevatron , that is the process @xmath33 where a plus  denotes a large rapidity gap .",
    "however , we find that there is a huge qcd background arising from double - diffractive dijet production .",
    "a central detector to trigger on large @xmath36 jets is essential .",
    "even so , the signal - to - background ratio is too small for a viable missing - mass  higgs search .",
    "the situation is much improved if we identify @xmath1 and @xmath54 jets .",
    "the @xmath153 signal is now in excess of the qcd @xmath78 background , even for a mass resolution of @xmath154 .",
    "the only problem is that , when proper account is taken of the survival probability of the rapidity gaps , the @xmath33 event rate is too small at the tevatron . recall that the experimental limit on the cross section for double - diffractive dijet production confirms the predicted small rates .",
    "the pessimistic expectations of the missing - mass higgs search at the tevatron are , however , compensated by an interesting by - product of the double - diffractive proposal .",
    "the double - diffractive production of dijets offers a unique _ gluon factory _ , generating huge numbers of essentially pure gluon jets from a colour - singlet state in an exceptionally clean environment .",
    "recall that the exclusive production of @xmath155 dijets , with a large rapidity gap on either side , is strongly suppressed by the @xmath61 selection rule .",
    "finally , we give estimates for the double - diffractive production of @xmath3 and @xmath2 mesons at the tevatron .",
    "these mesons have smaller mass than the higgs boson or dijet systems that we have considered , and so the qcd cross section estimates are much more qualitative .",
    "nevertheless the rates are huge , and the observation of @xmath3 and @xmath2 production ( from colour - singlet states ) should illuminate intriguing features of heavy flavour dynamics .",
