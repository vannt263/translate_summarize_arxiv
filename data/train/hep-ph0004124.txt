    "<S> furthermore , the existence of a light higgs with a tree - level upper bound ( independent of the values of the soft masses of all other scalar partners ) on its mass , @xmath0 , is one of the most solid , and model independent , predictions of supersymmetric theories . </S>",

    "<S> we will see that the upper bound on @xmath24 ( i.e. on @xmath0 ) can be considerably enhanced with respect to the nmssm case . in the simplest example that we will explicitly work out , based on one - extra dimension compactified on the orbifold @xmath25 , the absolute upper bound is increased to @xmath6 gev . </S>",

    "<S> we compare it with the corresponding curve for the 4d nmssm unifying at @xmath15 and with logarithmic running of the couplings . to obtain the curves of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure ] we have used initial conditions for the gauge couplings , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , according to the corresponding experimental values for gauge couplings and the top and bottom - quark masses . </S>",
    "<S> radiative corrections are taken from the mssm , with @xmath127 tev and maximal stop mixing .    </S>",
    "<S> if one of the higgs fields , @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , is in the bulk and the other , @xmath73 ( @xmath72 ) , in the 4d boundary , one can still have the coupling ( [ superp ] ) consistent with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ condition ] ) if the singlet(s ) @xmath12 is in the 4d boundary . </S>",
    "<S> however we will not consider this case in detail since the obtained bound is weaker than in the previous one . </S>",
    "<S> in fact using ( [ wavedef ] ) and ( [ wave ] ) one can see that now @xmath128 and , assuming as before a model with @xmath63 , we get @xmath129 that yields , using ( [ upperapp ] ) , an absolute upper bound @xmath130  gev .    up to this point we have considered a genuine 5d mechanism by which the lightest higgs mass upper bound in the nmssm unifying at a given scale @xmath31 can be enhanced , i.e. the effect by which @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> there is also another possibility , in particular @xmath64 , that we have not yet considered . </S>",
    "<S> however this possibility , already existing in 4d models unifying at scales @xmath132  @xcite , will not be discussed in great length . </S>",
    "<S> we only wish to mention how it can be achieved in the class of the considered 5d models . </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the 4d boundary eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ unif ] ) can be satisfied for models with @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , considering right - handed quarks and leptons living in the bulk , @xmath76 ( two extra @xmath75-like hypermultiplets in the bulk ) @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( one hypermultiplet in the @xmath135 ) , one obtains a model that unifies at one - loop as the mssm but with @xmath136 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath137 and , using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ upperapp ] ) , one gets an absolute upper bound on @xmath0 as @xmath138  208 gev . however , as discussed earlier , in this class of models the condition for the dominance of the kk threshold effects @xmath139 can be endangered if @xmath140 .    </S>",
    "<S> a further interesting point is how robust is the present bound on the higgs mass , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure ] , with respect to the number of dimensions @xmath28   </S>",
    "<S> 4d supermultiplets . </S>",
    "<S> our results crucially depend on this assumption , which is naturally realized in models with @xmath141 . ] and also with respect to the regularization scheme used in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rge ] ) through ( [ rge2 ] ) . for an arbitrary number of dimensions @xmath28 and regularization scheme choice </S>",
    "<S> , we should replace in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rge ] ) through ( [ rge2 ] ) , @xmath142 , and in ( [ escala ] ) , @xmath143 , where the function @xmath144 depends on the chosen regularization scheme and orbifold projection . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5-function for @xmath1 behaves as @xmath145 , the running is faster than linear if @xmath34 and also depends on the regularization scheme @xmath144 . however using the resulting modified relation between @xmath32 and @xmath31 , @xmath146 </S>",
    "<S> we can see that one obtains the approximate relation at low energy , @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is given in ( [ erre ] ) , and so the relation ( [ upperapp ] ) , involving the lightest higgs mass @xmath0 , holds . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , a change in the number of dimensions @xmath28 and/or the renormalization scheme @xmath144 , that can modify the rate of running of all parameters of the theory , can be approximately encoded in a change of the value of the unification scale @xmath31 , while the prediction on the upper bound of the lightest higgs mass remains invariant .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we have considered how the presence of extra dimensions can change the absolute upper bound on the lightest higgs mass in extensions of the mssm with singlets . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we have found that if either of the higgs or singlet multiplets live in the bulk of the extra dimension , because of the absence of wave function renormalization of @xmath4 hypermultiplets to leading order , the @xmath5-function of the yukawa coupling involving the singlet and higgs superfields is suppressed , leading to a slower running of the coupling and to a larger value at low scale , with the corresponding enhancement of the tree - level contribution to the higgs mass . </S>",
    "<S> this effect raises the higgs mass from @xmath149 gev in 4d models to @xmath150 gev in models with extra dimensions and some matter fields living in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy behaviour of these models is like the nmssm but with an enhanced lightest higgs mass . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement corresponds to the range of energies that will be explored in the near future and can thus have an important phenomenological impact . </S>"
