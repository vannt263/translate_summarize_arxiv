    "high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) is a highly non - linear process in which a medium in an intense laser field emits coherent radiation at multiples of the driving frequency .",
    "the short time scale of the generation process makes hhg a promising source of coherent attosecond pulses in the xuv regime .",
    "when the target is isotropic , such as a gas of atoms or unaligned molecules , it follows from symmetry arguments that the emitted harmonics have to be polarized parallel to the polarization axis of a linearly polarized driving laser . breaking this isotropy by using a sample of aligned molecules for hhg allows for a non - vanishing perpendicular polarization component .",
    "this scenario is sketched in fig .",
    "the perpendicular component is generally heavily suppressed compared to the parallel component .",
    "this has lead to a focus in the literature on the parallel component .",
    "recent experiments on aligned n@xmath0 , o@xmath0 and co@xmath0 , however , have reported a non - vanishing perpendicular component  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "elliptically polarized harmonics have been measured from aligned n@xmath0 and co@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the presence of elliptically polarized harmonics opens up the possibility of generating elliptically polarized attosecond pulses in the xuv regime .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the observation of elliptically polarized harmonics is very interesting because it serves as an important benchmark for different models .",
    "several approaches are currently used to calculate the hhg response .",
    "ideally , one should propagate the tdse  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used for atoms and small molecules .",
    "an example is the prediction of comparable polarization components from aligned h@xmath1 near minima in the spectrum  @xcite . for systems beyond h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 one commonly uses the semi - classical simple - man s model  @xcite or the quantum mechanical lewenstein model  @xcite to describe hhg .",
    "both models provide a three - step picture of the process in which a single active electron is brought into the continuum due to its interaction with the laser field , propagates in the field , and subsequently recombines and emits radiation .",
    "the calculation of hhg spectra using the lewenstein model is generally combined with a stationary - phase method to reduce the computational cost . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ standard stationary - phase method ] , this procedure causes the resulting harmonics to be linearly polarized parallel to the polarization of the driving laser .",
    "this shortcoming has been attributed to the lewenstein model itself  @xcite .",
    "however , the standard stationary - phase method is not in general valid for molecular targets as it fails to take into account the spatial extent of the molecule  @xcite . instead",
    ", an extended stationary - phase method can be applied to evaluate the lewenstein model , which leads to so - called exchange harmonics  @xcite .",
    "these are contributions to the total harmonic emission that are caused by quantum orbits describing an ionization event at one atomic center followed by recombination at another atomic center [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ] .",
    "we show that the lewenstein model does lead to elliptically polarized high - order harmonics when exchange harmonics are included .",
    "exchange harmonics rely on a correlation between the ionization and recombination events in hhg .",
    "this is different to the perpendicular harmonic component reported in  @xcite , which is obtained using scattering states for the continuum dynamics , thus causing a spread in momentum of the returning electron .",
    "the derivation in  @xcite uses the standard stationary - phase method in order to separate the three steps of the hhg process .",
    "consequently , any correlation , in the sense of exchange harmonics , between ionization and recombination sites is lost .",
