    "the observation of static stripe correlations in @xmath6 renewed the interest in rare - earth - doped ( @xmath0 ) lanthanide copper oxides.@xcite the observation of static stripes is induced by a low - temperature ( lt ) structural transition from a low - temperature orthorhombic ( lto ) to a tetragonal low - temperature phase ( ltt ) .",
    "a static superlattice structure appears close to the structural transition , which can be accounted for by the appearance of evenly spaced static stripes.@xcite on the other hand , the incommensurability of the magnetic 2d correlations seen in neutron scattering experiments@xcite with la@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath4 can be viewed as a consequence of the formation of charged stripes separating antiferromagnetically ordered domains , because the magnetic order parameter suffers an antiphase jump across such a domain wall.@xcite the sr dependence of the antiferromagnetic incommensurability is consistent with the gathering of the doped carriers in domain walls.@xcite in la@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath4 the domain walls are expected to be very mobile objects,@xcite rendering the experimental proof of their existence extremely difficult .    the antiferromagnetic incommensurability is assumed to be the same in the lto and ltt phase.@xcite since in the ltt phase the incommensurability can be accounted for by the static stripes the obvious conclusion is that in the lto phase the incommensurability may be caused by dynamical stripes.@xcite a better understanding of the influence of the lto - ltt transition on the electronic system is thus desirable .",

    "the tilt axis is parallel [ 110]@xmath12 and rotates discontinuously by @xmath13 towards the [ 100]@xmath12 direction at the transition into the ltt phase ( we use the notation of the undistorted tetragonal high - temperature phase htt ) .",
    "note that the tilt angle @xmath14 is roughly the same in the lto and the ltt phase while the different directions of the tilt produce different buckling pattern of the @xmath15 plane .",
