    "in recent years , a number of multi - wavelength surveys have been completed in order to understand the evolution of the multi - wavelength properties of galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) throughout cosmic history .",
    "deep observations spanning from the ultraviolet to the radio are time consuming and obtaining spectroscopic follow - up observations of cataloged galaxies and agns requires many nights on the largest telescopes available .",
    "thus , the area covered by many of the deepest multi - wavelength surveys is fairly small . with the advent of new wide - field optical and near - infrared imagers and multi - object spectrographs , as well as superb new space facilities such as _ galex _ and",
    "_ spitzer _ , the amount of the sky observed at all possible wavelengths is growing steadily .",
    "one of the early deep , wide area , optical surveys , the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ; jannuzi et al .",

    "_ ) consists of two @xmath3 square degree fields ( the botes and cetus fields ) with excellent optical ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) and near - infrared ( @xmath7 ) photometry .",
    "the ndwfs botes field has become a popular target for many investigators and now has been observed across the full electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "deep galex pointings provide near and far - ultraviolet photometry for the field ; the ndwfs images consist of optical and near - infrared coverage , and the flamingos extragalactic survey ( flamex ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observed the field to deep limits in @xmath8 and @xmath9 . _",
    "spitzer _ has imaged the botes field with both irac ( * ? ? ?",
    "* spitzer shallow survey ; ) and mips .",
    "radio observations include deep westerbork observations at 1.4 ghz @xcite and imaging by the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters survey ( first ; * ? ? ?",

    "optical spectroscopy for several highly complete samples of galaxies and agn has been completed with the hectospec multi - object spectrograph on the mmt as part of the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages ; kochanek in prep ) . a small region in the botes field",
    "was observed as part of the lala survey to search for galaxies at very high redshifts @xcite .",
    "these data sets have allowed searches for high - redshift quasars and low mass stars using mid - infrared selection techniques @xcite , studies of the quasar luminosity function @xcite , the clustering of high - redshift galaxies @xcite , lyman alpha emitting galaxies @xcite , the broad band properties of agns @xcite , the x - ray properties of agns @xcite , the spectral properties of infrared sources @xcite and many other topics .    in this paper , we present new @xmath0-band observations of 7.6 square degrees in the ndwfs botes region .",
    "these catalogs reach several magnitudes deeper than the public imaging released by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and will provide a useful intermediate photometric measurement between the i band data from ndwfs and near - infrared photometry from flamex .",
    "we release the catalogs and reduced images for public use . throughout this paper ,",
    "all magnitudes are ab magnitudes @xcite .",
    "the imaging survey was completed with the 90prime wide - field imager @xcite at prime focus on the bok 2.3 m telescope located on kitt peak .",
    "this instrument consists of four 4096x4096 thinned ccds , providing excellent quantum efficiency in the blue , read out using eight amplifiers .",
    "the chips are arranged in a windowpane pattern with 10 gaps between each of the ccds .",
    "each ccd images a 30x30 field on the sky with 0.45 \" pixels .",
    "the south - east ccd has a large electron trap , making 13% of the area on that chip unusable for photometric measurements .",
    "these pixels are masked throughout the reduction process and are excluded when images are stacked .",
    "the data were obtained between 28 feb 2005 and 31 mar 2005 .",
    "sky conditions varied from photometric to moderate levels of cirrus throughout the observations .",
    "the typical seeing during these observations was 1.6 arcsec . in total , we completed observations for eight 90prime pointings within the ndwfs botes region . at each location",
    ", we obtained several dithered 300s exposures ( typically 12 exposures per field ) .",
    "the telescope was moved @xmath10 for each dither .",
    "the total number of exposures for each field was determined by the conditions at the time of the observations .",
    "all of the exposures for a single field were obtained on the same night .",
    "as the gaps between ccds on 90prime are rather large , we did not attempt to make our dither pattern large enough the fill the regions between each ccd .",
    "this strategy avoids having non - uniform depth across a single field but results in gaps in our photometric coverage of the ndwfs survey field .",
    "figure [ fig : fullcoverage ] shows the region covered in the zbotes survey compared to the ndwfs botes survey area . throughout the rest of this paper , each of the fields imaged by a single 90prime ccd is treated independently .",
    "all of the raw images were processed using a combination of home - grown idl routines and various tasks available within the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "each image was bias and overscan corrected and known bad columns are removed by interpolating neighboring columns . on each night of clear skies , observations of the twilight sky were taken to generate a flat field image that was divided into each object frame to correct for pixel - to - pixel variations in the ccd sensitivity .",
    "while the thinned - chip nature of the ccds on 90prime allows for high efficiency in the blue , it also results in strong fringing in the reddest bands where the night sky spectrum is dominated by a forest of emission lines . on each night of observation ,",
    "between 12 and 42 individual dithered images were obtained for this project in the @xmath0-band . to generate a master fringe frame , we first removed any large scale gradient in the background of each input image .",
    "the strength of the fringe pattern was then measured on each image and a multiplicative scale factor was applied to correct for any differences from the mean .",
    "we generated a master fringe frame by taking the median of all of the individual images taken on a single night of observations .",
    "this fringe frame was scaled to match the average strength of the fringes in each individual exposure and subtracted .",
    "this process was iterated ( typically twice ) until the fringe pattern was no longer present in each individual exposure .",
    "figure [ fig : reduction ] ( a ) and ( b ) shows a region of a single exposure before any processing and after the fringe pattern was been removed .",
    "the astrometry of each image was calibrated by locating stars with @xmath11 from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr4 @xcite .",
    "we fit the astrometric solution with a 5th order tnx world - coordinate system ( wcs ) using the iraf task ccmap .",
    "the images were then de - projected onto a rectilinear pixel system using the task mscimage in the mscred package in iraf .",
    "finally , aperture photometry of several stars in the magnitude range @xmath11 was performed on each of the input frames in order to determine offsets in the background level and photometric zeropoint between each of the frames .",
    "any variations in the mean background or transparency were corrected before the individual images were stacked to create the final coadded frame for each field .",
    "pixels with values more than @xmath12 from the mean were clipped when creating the final mosaic ; this clipping rejected any cosmic rays present in the individual frames .",
    "figure [ fig : reduction ] shows a portion of a final stacked image .",
    "the photometric zeropoint for each stacked image was determined by comparison with photometry publicly available from the sdss @xcite .",
    "aperture photometry for stars with @xmath13 was compared to sdss psf magnitudes .",
    "the mean magnitude offset between the two photometric measurements was adopted as the magnitude zeropoint of the field .",
    "in general , the dispersion around this median was on the order of @xmath14 mag , comparable to the photometric scatter expected due to errors in the sdss photometry @xcite .",
    "as the effective response of the @xmath0-band filter used in our work ( including the effects of mirror reflectance and sky absorption ) is likely different from that of the sdss system , we examined the residuals between the photometry and the sdss photometry as a function of the sdss @xmath15 color of each object .",
    "the photometric residuals showed no correlation with the object color , and thus no color term has been applied to the photometry .",
    "several of the fields overlapped significantly .",
    "these regions of significant overlap were coadded , weighted by seeing and signal - to - noise in each input frame , to create mosaiced images of the overlap regions . before coadding the individual images in the overlap regions , each of the input images were background subtracted and the measured counts per pixel were converted to a true flux density per pixel measurement using the photometric zeropoint determined from comparison with public sdss photometry discussed above .",
    "figure [ fig : coaddmap ] illustrates the area of the field included in these coadded observations compared to the object distribution in the ndwfs optical catalogs .",
    "we constructed catalogs for each field using source extractor ( sextractor ) version 2.3 @xcite .",
    "we detected objects using a 0.9 `` fwhm gaussian convolution kernel and enforced a @xmath12 detection threshold .",
    "pixels were weighted according to the number of input exposures that contributed to each in order to prevent the detections of a large number of spurious sources around the edges of each field which have fewer average observations and thus higher background noise than the centers . for each object detected in the catalog , we measured the flux in @xmath16 apertures ( with diameter 3 '' , 5 `` , and 7 '' ) in a 6 arcminute radius around the object .",
    "we used the interval containing 68.7% of the measurements as a measurement of the photometric error for each object .",
    "the simulated photometric errors we calculate from this method are about a factor of 2 larger than those measured by sextractor .",
    "catalogs were also constructed for each of the stacked images created for the overlapping fields using the same process as used for individual subfields .",
    "the final catalog was constructed by checking each object for duplicate observations . for any object that was observed multiply",
    ", we define the best observation to be the measurement with the smallest simulated photometric errors .",
    "the final catalogs consists of over 200,000 objects .",
    "objects in the final catalogs were matched to detections in the ndwfs catalogs ( dr3 ) .",
    "for each ndwfs subfield , we checked for systematic offsets in both right ascension and declination between the astrometric system and the ndwfs reference frame . after removing any net offset between the ndwfs catalogs and our catalogs ( which are discussed in more detail in  4.3 ) ,",
    "the two object lists were matched with a 1 \" match tolerance and the name and coordinates of the closest match ndwfs detection were recorded in the final catalog .",
    "the final residuals between and sdss photometric measurements for well detected stars whose photometry is not affected by non - linearity in the 90prime ccds are centered around zero with a @xmath17 dispersion of 0.035 mag .",
    "the average quoted photometric error for the sdss stars is 0.03 mag and thus the majority of the final calibration error in the catalog can be attributed to photometric scatter in the sdss photometry . the remainder of the scatter in the photometric calibration is likely due to errors in the large - scale flatfield corrections to each frame and imperfect subtraction of the strong fringing the 90prime ccds .",
    "since 1.25 square degrees were observed more than once in the @xmath0botes imaging , we can quantitatively estimate the error in our photometric measurements , both from calibration errors and reduction imperfections .",
    "the distribution of fluxes for the @xmath18 stars with @xmath19 observed two or more times within itself has zero mean and a @xmath17 dispersion of 0.03 mag , in good agreement with the scatter in photometric calibration estimated above .",
    "as the astrometry was calibrated to the sdss reference system , the agreement between sdss and astrometry is quite good .",
    "figure [ fig : astrometry ] shows the differences between sdss , , and ndwfs astrometry .",
    "the dispersion between the and sdss coordinates is @xmath20 50 milliarcsec ( mas ) per coordinate while the agreement with ndwfs is poorer with a dispersion of nearly 130 mas per coordinate .",
    "sdss astrometry has a 45 mas dispersion per coordinate @xcite , so the astrometric error is dominated by astrometric errors in the sdss catalogs .",
    "also , notice that the ndwfs and astrometric have systematic offsets in both directions , likely due to the different astrometric reference systems used by ndwfs and sdss imaging .",
    "robust comparisons between ndwfs and ( or sdss ) thus require the removal of these offsets to properly match objects in each catalog .",
    "table 1 lists the average shifts between the astrometry of each field and the ndwfs catalog .",
