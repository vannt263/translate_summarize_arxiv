    "these include consideration of magnetic field activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , superfluidity and superconductivity of the matter within pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and modifications of the power law and related quantities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "time dependence of the constants in the mdr model has also been considered @xcite . in particular ,",
    "time evolution of the inclination angle between spin and magnetic dipole axes has been recently addressed @xcite . however , there is no model currently available that would yield , consistently , the typical spread of values of @xmath3 as illustrated in table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "for example , energy loss through emission of accelerated charged particles , forming a massive wind from the surface of rotating stars @xcite , or emission of higher multipole electromagnetic radiation , including the gravitational quadrupole component @xcite , has been studied .",
    "competition of different mechanisms , mdr , emission of gravitational waves , and particle winds was also investigated by @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus on determination of the maximum deviation of the braking index from the value @xmath6 by introducing two modifications of the simple mdr model : frequency dependence of moi , related to the change of shape of a deformable star due to rotation , and superfluidity of the pulsar core .",
    "the correction to the expression for the braking index arising from these modifications following glendenning @xcite is derived , and included in the calculation , using four realistic equations of state ( eos ) over a range of baryonic mass ( m@xmath7 ) .",

    "an essential input to the calculation of macroscopic properties of rotating neutron stars is the eos .",
    "the eos is constructed for two physically different regimes , the high density core and the relatively low density crust .",
    "the microscopic composition of high density matter in the cores of neutron stars is not well understood .",
    "we have chosen two eos , which assume that the core is made only of nucleons , kde0v1 @xcite and nrapr @xcite .",

    "_ @xcite as being among the very few that satisfied an extensive set of experimental and observational constraints on properties of high density matter .",

    "the maximum mass of a static star , calculated using the tolman - oppenheimer - volkof equation , is 1.96 , 1.93 , 1.98 , and 1.98 m@xmath11 for kde0v1 , nrapr , qmc700 , and hv , respectively , which is close to the gravitational mass of the heaviest known neutron stars @xcite .",

    "[ fig2 ] , which shows pressure as a function of energy density @xmath41 in units of nuclear saturation energy density @xmath42 = 140 mev/@xmath43 .",
    "we observe that the pressure increases as a function of energy density almost monotonically for kde0v1 , nrapr and hv , whereas qmc700 eos predicts a change in the rate of increase at about 4 @xmath42 .",
    "this change , and the subsequent softening of the eos , happens at the transition energy density marking the threshold for appearance of hyperons in the matter .",
    "such a change is not observed in the hv eos .",
    "the main reason for the difference between the two hyperonic models is that the qmc700 distinguishes between the nucleon - nucleon and nucleon - hyperon interactions ( neglecting the poorly known hyperon - hyperon interaction ) , whereas the hv model uses a universal set of parameters for all hadrons .",
    "inclusion of both the qmc700 and hv eos in this work reflects the uncertainty in the theory of dense matter in the cores of neutron stars .    in order to ease the numerical calculation within the different architecture of the rpn and prns9 codes , two different eos in the low density region ( neutron star crust )",

    "the high density eos was matched to the harrison - wheeler @xcite , taken for the outer crust of the star , and negele - vautherin @xcite eos for the inner crust .",
    "as detailed in the previous section , the calculation of the frequency dependence of the braking index has been done for a multiple combination of codes , eos s and m@xmath7 of the rotating star .",

    "the two nucleon - only eos , kde0v1 and nrapr , behave in a very similar way and predict a larger value of n = 2.5 at this frequency .",
    "these trends can be directly related to the properties of the eos s . fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the sensitivity to m@xmath7 for the qmc700 eos .",
    "the effect clearly increases with decreasing m@xmath7 .",
    "we recall that the stiffness / softness of the eos relates to the rate of change of pressure with changing energy density @xmath41 . for each eos",

    "[ fig3 ] , observed for the hv eos , is seen to be associated with the smallest change in pressure with increasing @xmath41 , i.e. , the largest softness .",
    "the stiffest eos s , kde0v1 and nrapr , predict the smallest response to the pulsar s rotational deformation .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by results shown in fig .",
    "pulsars with the lowest m@xmath7 , governed by the softest eos , exhibit the largest change in the braking index at high frequency .",
    "the effects demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ]  @xmath12  [ fig4 ] were calculated assuming that the whole body of a pulsar contributes to the total ( core+crust ) moi . however , some theories suggest the conditions inside a pulsar are consistent with the presence of superfluid / superconducting matter , both in the crust and in the core @xcite",
    ". superfluid material would contribute to the rotation , thus reducing the moi .    in this work we considered an extreme case in which the whole contribution of the core to the total moi is removed .",
    "this scenario could be realized , for example , if either the whole core is superfluid or there is a layer of superfluid material between the core and the inner crust of the star , preventing an angular momentum transfer between the core and the crust .",
    "either scenario simply results in removal of the contribution of the core to the moi . to model",
    "this effect , it was necessary to locate the transition between the two phases of neutron star matter , which is assumed to occur roughly at 120 mev/@xmath43 .",
    "the corresponding pressure is dependent on the eos and is used to locate the physical position of the transition along the equatorial radius .",
    "the results are schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , which shows the proportion of the core radius in a static star and a star rotating at an arbitrarily chosen frequency of 600 hz as a function of m@xmath7 , as predicted by the kde0v1 eos .",
    "we observe that the proportion is different for a static and rotating star , mainly because of the varying shape of the star . the expansion ( compression ) along the equatorial ( polar ) direction with respect to the rotational axis leads to larger deformation of the less dense crust than that of the denser core .",
    "elimination of the core contribution can lead to a dramatic lowering of the total moi by more than a factor of three , as shown , for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for the 1.0  m@xmath11 baryon mass and the qmc700 eos .",
    "the difference between the total and crust - only moi shows a weak frequency dependence with a slight increase above about 600 hz .",
    "in turn , the reduction of the moi by removal of the core contribution leads to additional changes in the braking index , on top of the changes due to the frequency dependent moi ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) as shown in fig .",
    "this change is , as expected , larger for higher mass stars that contain a more significant proportion of dense core material than for lower mass stars that are more crustlike throughout .",
    "for the purpose of this work , we assumed that there is substantial superfluid material located in the core of the star but made no assumption on the superfluidity ( or not ) of the crust .",
    "the effects reported here should be taken as illustrative rather than definitive of the possible effects of superfluidity .",
    "the variation of braking index of isolated rotating neutron stars with m@xmath7 = 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , and 2.2  m@xmath11 with rotational frequency from zero to the kepler limit within the mdr model with frequency dependent moi has been investigated .",
    "the microphysics of the star was included through utilizing realistic eos of the pulsar matter .",
    "an illustration of the possible effect of superfluidity in the star core has been included in the study .",
    "compiling results of all models used in this work , including the superfluidity effect , we deduce a definitive upper and lower limit on the braking index as a function of frequency , shown in fig .",
    "the maximum change in the braking index is obtained with the qmc700 eos and 1.0 m@xmath11 ; the least effect is found for kde0v1 and the 2.2 m@xmath11 star .",
    "reduction of the braking index from the simple mdr model value @xmath6 happens only at frequencies that are some significant fraction of the kepler frequency .",
    "the calculation predicts that isolated pulsars with the braking index most deviating from @xmath6 have low m@xmath7 . for the frequencies of",
    "known isolated pulsars with accurately measured braking indices ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , the reduction away from @xmath9 found in this model , is negligible .",
    "in the model of isolated pulsars used in this work , the rate of change in rotational frequency of a spherical magnetized pulsar _ in vacuo _ depends on three factors : the moi ( constant or frequency dependent ) , the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment , and the inclination angle between the magnetic and rotational axes .",
    "the braking index is related to changes of these observables . in this work we considered effects due to changes to the moi and its variation and showed that any significant deviation from the @xmath6 value appears only at frequencies much higher than the frequency range of observed isolated pulsars with reliable braking index .",
    "as moi is related to the shape of the star , this result is consistent with the assumption of the simple mdr model that the pulsar is spherical at low frequencies .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] the correlation between the braking index and the deformation of the star in terms of the polar to equatorial radii ratio r@xmath47/r@xmath48 ( normalized to 3 for display ) .",
    "it follows that changes in moi alone can not explain the observed deviation of the braking index at low frequencies from the simple mdr model predictions .",
    "if the mdr model is to be sustained , attention has to be paid to changes in the magnitude magnetic dipole moment and/or in the inclination angle .",
    "as stated above , the lack of knowledge of the origin and properties of the pulsar s magnetic field makes the former task difficult but the latter may be worth pursuing , particularly in the view of recent work by lyne  _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "finally , we have shown that the simple exclusion of the core due to the superfluidity , or some superfluid barrier between the crust and core , does not have a strong effect on braking in the frequency range of observed isolated pulsars .",
    "further development of the idea of a macroscopic description of superfluidity would be interesting .",
    "change of the magnetic field due to superfluidity and possible magnetic field expulsion , and a consequential increase in surface magnetic field strength @xmath17 could also be usefully explored .",
