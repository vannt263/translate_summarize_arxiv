    "absorption processes and their signatures ( absorption lines ) imprinted on the spectra of bright background sources ( quasars , gamma - ray bursts , etc . ) are one of the main sources of information about the physical and chemical properties of intervening systems .",
    "it is well known that information about their temperature , density , chemical abundances , and kinematics can be extracted from the analysis of these absorption lines .",
    "for instance , a detailed insight into the physical state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is provided by the analysis of the absorption lines found in the spectra of distant quasars ( qsos ) ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these lines are due mainly to absorption by neutral hydrogen ( hi ) present in a class of low column density absorbers generally known as ly@xmath3 forest , and due to other elements in low ionisation stages ( cii , civ , si ii , mgii , feii , oii , etc . ) , which arise in higher column densities absorbing systems associated with galaxies , such as the lyman limit systems ( llss ) and damped ly@xmath3 absorbers ( dlas ) . a wealth of information about the distribution , density , temperature , metal content , etc .",
    "of these systems is now available as a result of exhaustive and extensive studies of qso absorption lines ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review on ly@xmath3 absorbers , and on metal systems and dlas , respectively ) .    in this type of analysis , and within the realm of a given cosmological model , the number and observed central wavelength of the absorption lines provide information on the spatial distribution of the absorbing systems .",
    "furthermore , knowledge about the actual physical state of these systems can be obtained basically from the line profiles .",
    "both line counting and line profile measurement are tricky tasks though , since the accuracy with which they can be performed highly depends on the resolution of the observed spectra .",
    "for instance , depending on the spatial distribution of the absorbing systems , lines can appear very close to each other or even superpose ( line blending ) , and a low spectral resolution may lead to the misidentification of the resulting composite profile as being a single , complex one . because of this same reason , the determination of the exact shape of each individual absorption profile is far from being trivial , and misidentified profiles may lead to wrong conclusions about the properties of the absorbing systems .",
    "if one assumes that the physical state of the absorbing medium is uniquely defined by its temperature and column density , single absorption line profiles are ideally described by voigt profiles .",
    "mathematically , a voigt profile is given in terms of the convolution of a gaussian and a lorentzian distribution function , known as voigt - hjerting function @xcite , and a constant factor that contains information about the relevant physical properties of the absorbing medium ( cf .",
    "[ sec : abc ] ) .",
    "any departure from a pure voigt profile in the observed lines is expected to yield information about the kinematic properties ( non - thermal broadening , rotational or turbulent macroscopic motions ) , as well as spatial information ( clustering ) of the absorbing systems .    the voigt - hjerting function has long been known and , consequently",
    ", various numerical methods to estimate and tabulate this function have been developed and presented @xcite .",
    "also , a great effort has been done in order to derive a semi - analytic approximation to this function that reproduces its behavior with high accuracy ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , being the latter by far the one with the highest accuracy . with the help of these methods ,",
    "computational subroutines have been developed that make it nowadays possible to numerically integrate this function for a wide parameter space ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "the aim of this work is to make a further contribution to the practical handling of the voigt - hjerting function in order to compute voigt profiles . starting with an exact expression for this function in terms of harris infinite series ,",
    "we argue why this series may be truncated to first order in @xmath4 in the context of intergalactic hi absorption lines .",
    "we then show that the second term of this series can be approximated with a non - algebraic polynomial function , which is mathematically simple to handle in the sense that is does not contain singularities .",
    "such an analytic , well - behaved expression in terms of simple functions as presented here is very attractive , since it allows one to replace the many steps and operations needed for numerical integration , or to read from look - up tables of values , by a single line with simple operations .",
    "it is also extremely flexible to implement in various types of codes and machines , and is particularly useful for computational routines in higher - level programming languages ( _ e.g. _ idl , _ mathematica _ , _ maple _ , etc . ) , in which numerical integration or look - up table reading is cumbersome , especially if absorption line profiles have to be calculated many times with moderate precision and relative high speed .",
    "for instance , such an analytic expression should be very useful to synthesise ly@xmath3 absorption spectra as in _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , or in line - fitting algorithms like autovp @xcite or fitlyman @xcite , used to obtain line parameters such as redshift , column density , and doppler width from absorption voigt profiles imprinted on observed spectra .    in the next section we briefly outline the origin of the voigt - hjerting function in the physics of absorption processes , and define the context in which the desired approximation of this function is of interest to us . in sections [ sec : dawson ] and [ sec : analyt ] we derive this approximation , and in section [ sec : ana ] we compare the accuracy and speed of a numerical method for computing voigt profiles based on our approximation to other existing methods . in section",
    "[ sec : app ] we present an application of our method to model voigt profiles , and in section [ sec : summ ] we summarise our main results .",
    "the probability of a photon with an energy @xmath5 to be absorbed within a gas with column density n and kinetic temperature @xmath6 , also known as absorption coefficient , is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a constant for the @xmath9th electronic transition caused by the photon absorption . here",
    "@xmath10 is the electron mass , @xmath11 is the oscillator strength , and @xmath12 the damping constant or reciprocal of the mean lifetime of the transition .",
    "the function @xmath13 is the so - called * voigt - hjerting function * and is given by @xmath14 let @xmath15 be the resonant wavelength of the corresponding transition , and @xmath16 the thermal or doppler broadening , which defines a doppler unit . here",
    ", the doppler parameter @xmath17 is related to the kinetic temperature of the gas via @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath20 is the proton mass .",
    "it follows from these definitions that the damping parameter @xmath21 quantifies the relative strength of damping broadening to thermal broadening , and that the variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 are just the wavelength difference relative to the resonant wavelength in doppler units , and the particle velocity in units of the doppler parameter , respectively .",
    "the particular form of the absorption coefficient ( [ eq : tau ] ) induces a characteristic absorption feature known as voigt profile .",
    "hence , the voigt profile , and consequently the voigt - hjerting function , naturally arise in the process of absorption - line formation , when one assumes that the physical state of the absorbing medium is uniquely defined by its density and kinetic temperature . generally speaking , it is the physical conditions what determines the shape of the absorbing features , _",
    "i.e. _ the line profiles .",
    "conversely , it is true that line profiles give information about the physical state of the absorbing medium . in particular",
    ", line profiles other than voigt profiles give information about the departure of the physical conditions assumed here .    the class of hi absorbers present in the igm ( ly@xmath3 forest clouds ) and associated with galaxies and larger structures ( llss , dlas ) can be characterised by their column density @xmath24 and kinetic temperature , and consequently their absorption features observed on _",
    "e.g. _ qso spectra are well described by voigt profiles .",
    "their observed column densities span a range of ten orders of magnitude , approximately from @xmath25 , and have temperatures that correspond to doppler parameters approximately in the range @xmath26 , with a median value around @xmath27 that decreases with redshift @xcite .",
    "for such a range in @xmath17 , the damping parameter @xmath4 for the lyman transitions of intergalactic hi spans a range of @xmath28 . in this case",
    ", high values of @xmath4 correspond to ly@xmath3 , while lower values are typical for higher order lyman transitions . transitions of other elements , such as c , si , mg , fe , o , etc . , and their various ionisation stages , are also typically found on qso spectra , and their damping parameters cover a range which strongly overlaps with that of hi .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig : adis ] , where we show the distribution of @xmath4 for different elements ( including hi ) in different ionisation stages , for a doppler parameter @xmath29 for hi , and assuming that the doppler parameter for other elements is related to @xmath30 via @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the mass of element @xmath33 . for clarity",
    ", we have grouped all different ionisation stages of a given element under a single label .",
    "the values of the atomic constants ( central wavelength of the transition and @xmath34-value ) have been taken from @xcite , is available in plain - text format at www.astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de/~tepper/hjerting/damping.dat",
    ". please consult this list in order to know the exact value of @xmath4 for a given element in a given ionisation stage . ] .",
    "the shaded area contains the values of @xmath4 above the range characteristic to intergalactic hi for which our approximation to the voigt - hjerting function  derived in the next sections ",
    "cannot be applied or should be applied with caution .",
    "note , however , that the region spanned by @xmath4 for intergalactic hi , _ i.e. _ the region underneath the shaded area , contains most of the @xmath4-ranges spanned by all other elements , especially those corresponding to c , o , mg , and fe .",
    "for other elements , such as cr or zn , the damping parameter has values right at the upper limit of this range .",
    "for this reason and for the sake of simplicity , in the following we will constrain our discussion to the lyman absorption lines of intergalactic hi , but the reader shall bear in mind that the the discussion and method to synthesise voigt profiles presented in this work can be directly applied to the transitions of other elements associated with hi absorbing systems , according to figure [ fig : adis ] .",
    "following @xcite , it is true that for @xmath35 , _",
    "i.e. _ when doppler broadening dominates over damping broadening , the voigt - hjerting function ( [ eq : vhf ] ) can be expressed as @xmath36 where the functions @xmath37 are defined by @xmath38 these functions are bounded with respect to @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and they have values of the order of unity .",
    "indeed , taking the absolute value of the integral , neglecting the cosine , which takes values of the order of unity , and computing the resulting integral one can show that @xmath41 for all @xmath42 and @xmath43 . from this",
    "it follows that if @xmath44 , the voigt - hjerting function can very well be approximated to zeroth order in @xmath4 by the first term of the series ( [ eq : vhf2 ] ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath45 as first noted by @xcite .",
    "note that this result is _ exact _ in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "taking the definition ( [ eq : vhf3 ] ) , it follows that @xmath47 and thus @xmath48 for @xmath44 .",
    "we call this the voigt - hjerting function to _ zeroth order_.    but what actually means that the condition @xmath44 be satisfied , so that this zeroth order approximation can be safely used to model absorption line profiles ? in order to address this , we compute for the extreme values of @xmath4 for intergalactic hi , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the departure of the voigt - hjerting function from a pure gaussian function . this",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : hvsh0 ] as the logarithmic difference between ) . ]",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath51 relative to @xmath13 as a function of @xmath40 , _",
    "i.e. _ the quantity .",
    "note how the zeroth order approximation completelly differs from the actual voigt - hjerting function at @xmath52 for @xmath53 , and at @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "thus , even a value of @xmath4 as small as @xmath56 is not a sufficient condition for the zeroth order term to be a good approximation of @xmath13 for an arbitrary range in @xmath40 .    in the context of the hi absorption coefficient",
    ", the condition on @xmath4 for which the approximation to zeroth order of the voigt - hjerting function is valid , translates into a restriction on @xmath24 , and more specifically on the quantity @xmath57 .",
    "this can be seen by taking a glance at equation ( [ eq : tau ] ) : despite the fact that the condition @xmath44 holds , the product @xmath58 can be very large for high enough is satisfied . ]",
    "column densities , and since the functions @xmath59 are of the order of unity , such terms can have a significant contribution to the absorption coefficient . along this line of reasoning , and taking into consideration that the constant @xmath60 in equation ( [ eq : tau ] ) is of the order of @xmath61 for all lyman transitions , it is clear that the departure of the voigt - hjerting function from its zeroth order approximation becomes significant in the wavelength ranges @xmath62 and @xmath54 ( in doppler units ) at column densities @xmath63 for a damping parameter @xmath64 , and at column densities @xmath65 for @xmath66 . since intervening hi absorbers typically have column densities in the range @xmath67 , a gaussian approximation to @xmath13 for modeling intergalactic hi absorption line profiles is only suitable for the low end of the column density range .",
    "in addition to the factor @xmath58 being large and even more decisive for the uselessness of the zeroth order approximation for an arbitrary range in @xmath40 , is the fact that the zeroth order term , @xmath68 , rapidly decreases for large values of @xmath40 and is therefore overwhelmed by higher order terms in harris expansion , which hence dominate the behavior of the absorption coefficient , as already seen in figure [ fig : hvsh0 ] . to shed some light on this ,",
    "consider the following numerical example : out to @xmath69 ( in doppler units ) , and for @xmath64 , the voigt - hjerting function is of the order of @xmath70 .",
    "the zeroth order term in the series ( [ eq : vhf2 ] ) satisfies @xmath71 , whereas the first order term @xmath72 .",
    "thus , at large enough @xmath40 , the behaviour of @xmath73 is evidently governed by the terms of order @xmath74 in the series ( [ eq : vhf2 ] ) .      due to the arguments stated above , and even though the damping parameter satisfies @xmath44 , it is clear that the absorption coefficient of intergalactic hi can not simply be approximated by a constant times @xmath68 for an arbitrary wavelength range and column densities grater than @xmath75 .",
    "one actually has to take into account terms of higher order in the series ( [ eq : vhf2 ] ) , at least to first order in @xmath4 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath76 in fact , one should take into account all terms up to @xmath77th order for values of @xmath78 that are nearly equal or greater than the absolute difference between the sum @xmath79 and the exact voigt - hjerting function .",
    "however , as we shall show next , the approximation to first order in @xmath4 in harris expansion is enough to model absorption line profiles with moderate to high accuracy for the range of parameters @xmath80 characteristic to intervening hi absorbers .    in order to prove the above statement , we look at the relative contribution of the zeroth and first order terms to the voigt - hjerting function for @xmath81 and an arbitrary range in @xmath40 .",
    "this is achieved , for example , by computing the logarithm of the quantity @xmath82 as a function of @xmath40 for the two extreme values of @xmath4 , as shown in figure [ fig : hvsh0h1 ] .",
    "here we have advanced the function @xmath83 which is being handled in the next section .",
    "note that the greater the contribution from the zeroth and first order term to @xmath13 , the smaller the quantity @xmath84 . in this case , as can clearly be seen , @xmath84 takes on values of the order of @xmath85 or less over the whole wavelength range shown here and for the whole range in @xmath4 for intergalactic hi .",
    "if one takes into account that @xmath86 for all @xmath40 , it is obvious that the relative difference is equal or greater than the _ absolute _ difference , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath87 .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath50 and @xmath88 , the departure of @xmath13 from its first order approximation becomes significant at column densities @xmath89 , and at even larger @xmath24 for @xmath90 and/or smaller @xmath84 .",
    "hence , the first two terms of harris expansion dominate the behaviour of @xmath13 over the whole wavelength range shown here , with an accuracy of @xmath85 or greater , for the range in @xmath4 characteristic to intergalactic hi . on this basis",
    ", we consider thar an approximation to first order in @xmath4 of the voigt - hjerting function in terms of the functions @xmath51 and @xmath83 is suitable to model voigt profiles .",
    "since the function @xmath51 is known and simple _ per se _ , we now turn to the task of finding an approximation to the function @xmath83 in terms of a simple , analytic expression .",
    "according to definition ( [ eq : vhf3 ] ) we have @xmath91 integrating this equation partially , and computing the resulting sinus transform of a gaussian it follows @xcite @xmath92 \\ , , \\ ] ] where we adopt the notation first introduced by @xcite @xmath93 @xmath94 is known as the _ dawson function _ @xcite .",
    "it is evident that finding an approximation for @xmath83 translates into the same problem for @xmath94 .",
    "we thus want to show that a simple analytic expression can be found which approximates the dawson function , and hence the function @xmath83 , accurately enough , in order for an approximation of the voigt - hjerting function in terms of these functions to be useful for synthesising voigt profiles .",
    "we briefly want to state some important properties of the dawson - function .",
    "first , this function is antisymmetric , _ i.e. _ @xmath95 for all @xmath96 .",
    "because of this , from now on we restrict our analysis to @xmath97 .",
    "besides , it has no roots in the positive semi - axis , and @xmath98 , as can easily be seen from its definition ( fundamental theorem of calculus ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath94 is bounded , since @xmath83 is bounded itself ( cf .",
    "[ sec : low ] ) .",
    "indeed , differentiation with respect to @xmath40 gives @xmath99 hence , the upper bound is given by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is defined by equating @xmath94 s derivative to zero and solving for @xmath40 .",
    "actually , @xmath94 has its maximum at @xmath102 with @xmath103 ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "from this last equation it follows also that equation ( [ eq : h_1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath104 we want to know how the function @xmath94 behaves asymptotically , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath105 as well as for @xmath106 . using the power series of the exponential we get @xmath107 in this case , the sum and the integral operator commute ,",

    "expressing the term @xmath68 by its corresponding power series and rearranging terms , this last equation reads in explicit form @xmath110 thus , for @xmath111 the dawson function behaves asymptotically up to third order as @xmath112 in order to investigate how @xmath94 behaves for @xmath106 , we first rewrite the function ( [ eq : daw ] ) with the replacement @xmath113 and the aid of the power series of the exponential as @xmath114 with the definition @xmath115 it is not hard to see that every term of the series ( [ eq : daw4 ] ) is separately bounded with respect to @xmath40 as well as @xmath39 . making the replacement @xmath116 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : i_n ] ) , and integrating for @xmath117 we get for @xmath118 @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a rather cumbersome polynomial function .",

    "it is also true that @xmath126 converges to unity for @xmath127 and that @xmath83 converges to @xmath128 in this limit .",

    "we therefore explore the possibility of finding an analytic expression which is easy to handle and which can be used to compute the value of @xmath131 for @xmath129 .",
    "in particular , we shall see if it is possible to truncate the series ( [ eq : daw4 ] ) in order to find an approximation to @xmath94 , which has all its properties ( antisymmetry , boundedness , etc . ) , which converges for @xmath132 as well as for @xmath133 , and which is well defined in the whole range @xmath134 .",

    "the precision of our method relative to the other methods mentioned above is determined in the following way : first , the values of the voigt - hjerting function computed using monaghan s algorithm for @xmath166 $ ] and @xmath167 $ ] are taken as fiducial .",
    "then , the value of @xmath13 for the same range in @xmath40 and @xmath4 is computed using each of these methods , and the logarithmic difference between each method and its fiducial value , _",
    "i.e. _ the quantity @xmath168 with @xmath169 , is calculated as a function of @xmath40 for each different @xmath4 .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : comp ] .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that harris @xmath158 is the second most precise method to compute @xmath13 , if one takes monaghan s algorithm as fiducial , but is six times slower than harris @xmath157 , and one - and - a - half times slower than our method , as stated in the previous section .",
    "our method has a precision of @xmath0 or better for @xmath170 . for all values of @xmath4 , the difference peaks around @xmath171 to a value of the order of 0.01 , and",
    "the precision increases again for values of @xmath172 .",
    "the precision is better for smaller @xmath4 , as expected , since the zeroth order term gains in importance in our approximation for decreasing @xmath4 . for @xmath173 and @xmath174 ,",
    "our method is more precise than harris @xmath157 or huml@xmath159ek s , and , as seen above , 1.5 times faster than the latter .",
    "we now turn to analyse how accurate is our method in order to model hi absorption profiles . taking the whole range in column density @xmath175 $ ] dex and doppler parameters @xmath176 \\ , \\mathrm{km \\ ,      s^{-1}}$ ] characteristic to intergalactic hi , we synthesise for each pair @xmath177 ( with a resolution of @xmath178 dex , and @xmath179 ) a single ly@xmath3 absorption profile in the range @xmath180 $ ]  with a resolution of @xmath181  .",
    "the absorption profile is synthesised according to equations ( [ eq : tau ] ) and ( [ eq : vhf ] ) , using both our method and monaghan s to compute @xmath13 .",
    "we then compute for each pair @xmath177 the absolute value of the difference between the profiles generated using these two methods relative to monaghan s , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath182 , with @xmath183 , as a function of wavelength for the whole wavelength range , and pick the _ maximum _ value of this difference in the _ entire _ range . we choose to do so in order to pick up the worst cases possible , _",
    "i.e. _ those with the lowest accuracy , and put in this way a stringent lower limit to the accuracy of our method .",
    "the result is shown as a contrast diagram on the @xmath184-plane in figure [ fig : map ] .",
    "note that , in this case , it is not the logarithmic , but the _ linear _ difference which is shown .",
    "the highest precision is of the order of @xmath185 or even better .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , any value below @xmath0 has been coded as zero . the largest discrepancy between both methods , _",
    "i.e. _ the lower limit in the precision of our method if one takes monaghan s as fiducial , amounts to 0.01 , in agreement with the result shown in figure [ fig : comp ] .",
    "as can clearly be seen , the ( lower limit in the ) precision of our method depends both on @xmath17 and @xmath24 . while the dependence on @xmath17 extends to the whole range @xmath186 , the dependence on @xmath24 is limited to the range @xmath187 dex . for a fixed @xmath17",
    ", there is a regime of values around 0.01 with a width of nearly 2 dex , which gives as a result a narrow region of low accuracy all across the plane . along this stripe",
    ", the difference reaches its highest value of the order of 0.01 or smaller for the combinations ( low @xmath17 , low @xmath24 ) or ( high @xmath17 , high @xmath24 ) , in the @xmath188 and @xmath189ranges stated above . outside this stripe ,",
    "the accuracy increases dramatically to values of the order of @xmath0 or even better .",
    "the origin of any inaccuracy in our method is obviously the fact that terms of order @xmath190 have been neglected in the series ( [ eq : vhf2 ] ) , and furthermore , that the second term is this series has been approximated as well .",
    "in particular , the origin of the low - accuracy stripe on the @xmath191-plane can qualitatively be understood in terms of the functional dependence of @xmath192 on @xmath17 and @xmath24 .",
    "considering that both our method and monaghan s take the zeroth order term exactly into account , it is legitime to state that the quantity @xmath193 has a least a dependence of first order on @xmath4 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath194 where @xmath195 is a function that may be of zeroth order in @xmath4 . hence",
    ", using equation ( [ eq : tau ] ) and this last expression , it follows that @xmath196 as can be seen , @xmath73 strongly depends on the ratio @xmath197 .",
    "therefore , an increase in @xmath17 of one order of magnitude ( from 10 to 100 @xmath198 ) is nearly compensated ( in the sense that the value of @xmath73 remains nearly constant ) by an increase in @xmath24 of two orders of magnitude , which accounts for the stripe of 2 dex in column density seen on the @xmath184-plane .",
    "why this happens precisely between @xmath199 dex , as well as the shape of this stripe , is non - trivially related to the exact value of the constant @xmath200 , the fact that @xmath195 may depend also on @xmath17 through the damping parameter @xmath4 , and the fact that the @xmath201 depends effectively not on @xmath202 , but on @xmath203 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , for higher - order lyman transitions , the precision of our method to compute voigt profile has the same behaviour on the @xmath184-plane , and is the same as or even better than the precision of the ly@xmath3 transition shown here .",
    "the reasons for this are , first of all , that the functional form of the absorption coefficient is obviously the same , irrespective of the transition .",
    "in addition , the lowest precision possible of 0.01 is the same for the whole range in @xmath4 spanned by the lyman transitions , according to figure [ fig : comp ] .",
    "furthermore , higher transitions have lower damping parameters and our approximation is better the lower @xmath4 , as already mentioned . finally , since the constant @xmath200 is smaller the higher the order of the transition , the critical range of lowest precision is shifted to higher column densities and higher doppler parameters . since the ranges in @xmath24 and @xmath17 are fixed for intergalactic hi , this has the net effect of increasing the high - precision region on the @xmath204-plane_i.e .",
    "_ the region to the left of the stripe  for higher order transitions . in other words , the precision of our method improves from ly@xmath3 to higher lyman transitions .    even though a discrepancy of the order of 0.01 when using our method to model voigt profiles may seem large , we want to emphasise again that this is merely an _ lower _",
    "limit for the precision in the _ entire _ wavelength range @xmath180 $ ]  , in the case of ly@xmath3 .",
    "it turns out that the range in wavelength for which the accuracy is lowest is negligible for practical purposes . in order to show this",
    ", we first choose three points on the @xmath184-plane along the stripe of lowest precision , _",
    "i.e. _ for which the maximum difference is largest . using these parameters , we synthesise ly@xmath3 absorption profiles using our method and monaghan s , and compute again for each of these  worst scenarios  the quantity @xmath192 for the whole wavelength range .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : dla ] .",
    "each row corresponds , from top to bottom , to the parameter pairs @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 chosen along the low - precision stripe .",
    "the upper panel of each row shows the ly@xmath3 absorption profile synthesised using our method , and the corresponding lower panel gives the logarithmic difference @xmath208 between our method and monaghan s as a function of wavelength .",
    "as can be seen , the smallest discrepancies are given at the line cores , as expected , since in this regime the zeroth order term dominates and both our approach and monaghan s exactly take this term into account .",
    "the largest discrepancies , of the order of 0.01 , are present in an extremely narrow range of @xmath209  for @xmath210 , of @xmath211  for @xmath212 , and of @xmath213  for @xmath214 .",
    "this discrepancies are found at the boundaries between gaussian core and lorentzian wings , due to the fact that our method neglects terms of order @xmath190 , which dominate the behaviour of @xmath13 in that regime .",
    "note , however , that the difference rapidly drops with increasing distance ( in  ) from the line center to values of the order of _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath215 at a distance @xmath216  for the first two rows , and @xmath217  for last row .",
    "hence , the effective accuracy of our method is far better than 0.01 in the wavelength range shown here . for the same reason mentioned in the last paragraph , the precision for higher order lyman transitions is of the same order as or even better than for the ly@xmath3 transition shown here",
    "as a further test of the quality of our approximation to model voigt profiles , and to show its accuracy in a less academic situation as in the last section , we consider fitting a synthetic spectrum to a real quasar absorption spectrum with a population of intergalactic hi absorbers spanning a representative range in @xmath17 and @xmath24 along a random line - of - sight .",
    "for this purpose we use the observed spectrum of the quasistellar source qso j2233 - 606 , a relatively bright ( @xmath218 ) quasar at an intermediate redshift @xmath219 .    the spectrum of the source qso j2233 - 606 , centered at the hdf - s ,",
    "was obtained during the commissioning of the uves instrument at the vlt kueyen telescope and reduced at the space telescope european coordinating facility .",
    "the high - resolution spectroscopy ( r @xmath220 45000 ) was carried out with the vlt uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) .",
    "the data were reduced in the echelle / uves context available in midas .",
    "the final combined spectrum has constant pixel size of 0.05  and covers the wavelength range 3050 - 10000  .",
    "the s / n ratio of the final spectrum is about 50 per resolution element at 4000  , 90 at 5000  , 80 at 6000  , 40 at 8000  .",
    "the data used here are publicly available and were retrieved from www.stecf.org/hstprogrammes/j22/j22.html , in its version of november 23 , 2005 .    with help of the midas package fitlyman @xcite , which performs line fitting through @xmath221 minimization of voigt profiles , @xcite determined the redshifts , column densities , and doppler widths of the identified absorption features imprinted in the spectra of qso j2233 - 606 . in this way",
    ", they found that the line of sight to qso j2233 - 606 intersects a total of 270 ly@xmath3 forest clouds , and identified other 24 absorption systems containing metal lines .",
    "the ly@xmath3 absorbers span a range in column density of @xmath222 , and a range in doppler parameters of @xmath223 .",
    "the distribution of the parameter pairs @xmath177 for these systems for @xmath224 \\ ,      \\mathrm{km \\ , s^{-1}}$ ] is shown in figure [ fig : nhi_b ] .    using this list of ly@xmath3 line parameters @xmath225 ,",
    "we generate a synthetic spectrum of the qso j2233 - 606 in the wavelength range @xmath226  with a higher resolution than that of the observed spectrum of @xmath227  , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) , ( [ eq : h_13 ] ) , ( [ eq : h_14 ] ) , and ( [ eq : vhf4 ] ) .",
    "we synthesise a second spectrum using monaghan s algorithm , and compute the logarithmic difference @xmath192 between these two synthetic spectra in the same fashion as in the previous section . in this way",
    ", we test again our method against the highest - precision method available , for a typical range in column densities and doppler parameters present in a qso spectrum . the result is shown in figure [ fig : specdiff ] .",
    "the upper panels of each row show the observed spectrum and the spectrum synthesised using our method , whereas the lower panels show the logarithmic difference between both synthetic spectra .",
    "we choose to cut off the logarithmic difference at @xmath185 , since differences smaller than these are out of the range of the highest available numerical precision .",
    "it can be seen again , as in figure [ fig : dla ] , that the smallest discrepancies are given at the line cores , and the largest , of the order of @xmath0 , are given at the wings ( cf .",
    "discussion of figure [ fig : dla ] , section [ sec : mod ] ) . as can be seen from the column density and doppler parameter distribution in figure [ fig : nhi_b ] ,",
    "the largest discrepancies in this wavelength range are consistent with the maximum absolute differences shown in figure [ fig : map ] .",
    "note that in the spectral regions where no apparent absorption features are found , the logarithmic difference does _ not _ fall to @xmath228 , as one would naively expect .",
    "these features are present in figure [ fig : dla ] as well .",
    "the reason for this valley - shaped features is that , even though having small values away from the line center , the function @xmath13 does _ not _ fall to zero , and thus in these regions the wings of two or more lines overlap . strictly speaking",
    ", in these regions there is always some absorption left , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath229 , and different methods to compute @xmath13 will account for this effect differently .",
    "again , since our method neglects terms of order @xmath190 , the absorption in these regimes differs from its fiducial value .",
    "the lack of this terms in our approximation to @xmath13 is also pointed out pictorially by the local maxima symmetrically placed around the deeps corresponding to the logarithmic difference at the line cores .",
    "the absorption lines imprinted in the spectra of background sources yield a wealth of information about the physical and chemical properties of the intervening absorbing material , as is the case of intervening neutral hydrogen ( hi ) systems embedded in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and associated with galaxies and larger structures . in order to extract the desired information from these absorption lines , their profiles have to be modeled in a proper way . in the case of absorption features found on qso spectra ,",
    "absorption line profiles are best modeled by voigt profiles , which are mathematically given in terms of the voigt - hjerting function .    in this work",
    ", we presented a simple analytic approximation to the voigt - hjerting function with which voigt profiles can be modeled for an arbitrary range in wavelength ( or frequency ) , column densities up to @xmath230 , and for damping parameters satisfying @xmath231 .",
    "starting with an exact expression for the voigt - hjerting function in terms of harris expansion that is valid for @xmath35 , we showed that the zeroth order term of this series , a gaussian function , is suitable for modeling absorption line profiles emerging in a medium with low column density @xmath232 .",
    "however , for higher column densities , terms of higher order have to be taken into account . a key point leading to this conclusion",
    "is the fact that it is not the damping parameter alone , but rather the factor @xmath156 that determines to which extent terms of order higher than zeroth in harris expansion may or may not be neglected .",
    "we showed that the departure of the actual voigt - hjerting function from the first two terms in harris expansion is of the order of @xmath85 or less for an arbitrary wavelength range and @xmath2 .",
    "hence , we concluded that with an approximation to first order in @xmath4 to the voigt - hjerting function voigt profiles can be modeled with moderate to high accuracy .    on this basis , we obtained a simple analytic expression for the voigt - hjerting function and consequently for the absorption coefficient of intergalactic hi , in terms of an approximation for the second term @xmath83 of harris expansion .",
    "the main advantages of the analytic expression we presented here are , first , that it is valid for an arbitrary wavelength range , in the sense that is has no singularities .",
    "in addition , it is simple and flexible to implement in a variety of programming languages to numerically compute voigt profiles with moderate speed and moderate to high accuracy . as a matter of fact ,",
    "our method to compute the voigt - hjerting function is faster with respect to other known standard methods , for instance , huml@xmath159ek s or monaghan s algorithm .",
    "furthermore , our approximation reaches an accuracy of @xmath0 or better in a wide wavelength range , and of the order of than @xmath233 only a negligible wavelength interval , for values of @xmath4 and @xmath24 characteristic to intergalactic hi absorbers .",
    "our method thus offers a great compromise between speed , accuracy , and flexibility in its implementation .",
    "even though we did not extend our discussion in this work to other transitions typically present in quasar absorption spectra and associated to hi absorbers , such as metal lines , our method to synthesise voigt profiles can certainly be applied to most of these elements as well , since their column densities are obviously the same , and their ranges in @xmath4 strongly overlap with the range of @xmath4 for intergalactic hi , for which our approximation to the voigt - hjerting function is valid . as a matter of fact , our approximation is valid to model absorption voigt profiles found in any type of spectrum ( stellar , solar , etc . ) , which arise in a medium whose damping parameter and column density satisfy @xmath2 and @xmath234 , respectively .",
