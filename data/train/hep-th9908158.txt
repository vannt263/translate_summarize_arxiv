    "the absence of an interacting continuum limit or triviality of abelian gauge theories in four dimensions such as qed is due to the screening of charged particles by their interactions with virtual fermion - antifermion pairs from the vacuum .",
    "such charge screening is described by the vacuum polarization @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_vacpol ] ) .",
    "the qed vacuum is not a perfect insulator and can be considered as a medium of dipoles representing the fermion loops in the vacuum polarization .",
    "within perturbation theory , the electromagnetic charge or gauge coupling is screened completely in the continuum limit ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the ultraviolet cutoff ) .",
    "this can be seen by considering the renormalization group ( rg ) transformation of qed @xcite , which relates the gauge coupling or fine - structure constant @xmath8 in the infrared ( ir ) region to the bare gauge coupling @xmath9 in the ultraviolet ( uv ) region via @xmath10 , \\qquad   { \\cal r}_{\\alpha}\\left[\\mu/\\lambda,\\alpha_0\\right ] = \\frac{\\alpha_0}{1+\\pi\\left[\\mu/\\lambda,\\alpha_0\\right]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in perturbation theory , the one - loop leading contribution to @xmath5 is @xmath11 = \\frac{2n\\alpha_0}{3\\pi } \\ln\\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu } , \\label{vacpol1loop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the number of fermion flavors .",
    "this logarithmic screening effect is sufficient to cause the complete screening of charge in the continuum limit @xcite .    from the rg point of view triviality",
    "is merely due to the absence of an uv stable fixed point or nontrivial root of the @xmath3 function @xmath12}{\\partial w}\\biggr|_{w=1}= \\lambda \\frac{{d}\\alpha_0}{{d } \\lambda } \\label{betaadef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the gauge coupling .",
    "equation  ( [ vacpol1loop ] ) gives rise to the @xmath3 function @xmath13 , which only has an ir stable fixed point or trivial root : @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "a nontrivial or interacting theory only arises whenever @xmath16 has a root which is an uv stable fixed point . in case of asymptotic free theories such as qcd the origin",
    "@xmath14 is an uv stable fixed point .",
    "in addition to its motivation only on the level of perturbation theory the above consideration is too naive . according to the rg methods of wilson @xcite , one should consider the rg flow in the space of all coupling constants ( respecting certain symmetries ) or at least for those coupling constants which can be classified as relevant close to a particular critical manifold in coupling constant space .",
    "for a possible nontrivial continuum limit of qed , critical and hence nonperturbative dynamical effects are required .",
    "therefore , the discovery of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath17sb ) in the strong coupling phase of qed ( @xmath18 ) @xcite and the existence of an uv stable fixed point in the quenched - ladder approximation @xcite sheds new light on the nonperturbative nature of qed and triviality .",
    "lattice simulations of so - called noncompact quenched qed have confirmed the existence of a continuous chiral phase transition @xcite .",
    "an important step was performed by bardeen , leung , and love in refs .",
    "these authors realized that , in quenched - ladder qed , attractive four - fermion interactions described by a dimensionless four - fermion coupling @xmath19 have a so - called scaling dimension 4 instead of 6 at the critical gauge coupling @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , these operators mix with the gauge interaction which also has dimension 4 in four space - time dimensions ; this means that qed is not a closed theory at the chiral phase transition .",
    "the scaling dimension of an operator is important in determining whether or not such an operator describes a long - range interaction .",
    "the model of bardeen , leung , and love is referred to as the gauged nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio ( gnjl ) model , and the mechanism of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking proposed by them should be regarded in the context of the rg methods of wilson .",
    "wilson pointed out that a nontrivial renormalizable model can only be formulated if the rg transformation exhibits uv stable fixed points .",
    "uv stable fixed points are `` singular '' points functions . ] of the rg transformation at which the model becomes scale ( conformal ) invariant .",
    "natural candidates for uv stable fixed points are critical points governing a continuous phase transition . since , at a continuous phase transition , the correlation length @xmath21 is infinite and the model is scale invariant .",
    "the most crucial observation of wilson is that in the rg transformation , _ i.e. _ , the `` coarse graining '' process , new types of local interactions are generated and that the new interactions can be classified as either irrelevant or relevant interactions . only relevant ( including marginal ) interactions are important in determining what kind of infrared dynamics characterized by a scale @xmath22 emerges from the microscopic or bare model characterized by the cutoff @xmath7",
    ". the effect of irrelevant interactions can always be absorbed by adapting the coupling constants of relevant and marginal interactions .",
    "especially , close to a continuous phase transition , the rg methods show that it is impossible , _ a priori _ ( without solving the equations of motion ) , to determine which interactions are relevant or irrelevant ; particular interactions can acquire anomalous dimensions and interactions which are irrelevant in a certain region of coupling constant space might become relevant in another region .    in this respect",
    "the gnjl model should be considered as the wilsonian effective ( or microscopic ) action of qed taking into account the four - fermion interactions describing neutral scalar and pseudoscalar fermion - antifermion composites .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that there is a critical line ( curve ) in the coupling constant plane @xmath23 of the gnjl model separating a chiral symmetric phase from the chiral broken phase .",
    "the critical line is given by @xmath24 in the neighborhood of the critical line four - fermion interactions acquire sufficiently large anomalous dimensions to become relevant operators .",
    "the existence of nontrivial scaling behavior of the model near criticality implies that these scalar and pseudoscalar composites are relevant degrees of freedom at both short and long distances .",
    "lattice simulations of noncompact quenched qed with an induced four - fermion coupling were performed by the illinois group in refs .",
    "the illinois group obtained a critical point @xmath25 in the @xmath23 plane , which fits nicely on the critical line eq .",

    "2 .    in nonzero - spin channels ( think of @xmath5 , @xmath164 , etc . ) containing vertices which anti - commute with the @xmath163 matrix , the situation is different : planar @xmath30 and @xmath31 exchanges contribute with identical sign . let us now consider a planar contribution to the ( photon ) vacuum polarization containing a @xmath31 exchange . if we again move the @xmath163 matrices to the right - hand side of the trace , we get an overall minus sign due to the anti - commutation of @xmath163 with @xmath168 .",

    ", are nearly independent of @xmath1 , and are described rather well by the mean - field approach . to the contrary , the cancellation of scalars against pseudoscalars degrees of freedom does not occur in the vacuum polarization @xmath5 which is a nonzero - spin channel .",
