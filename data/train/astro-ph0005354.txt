    "regarding calibration we find that the sky brightness in the c_90 data resulting from the isophot fcs calibration yields a sky background which is about 30% brighter than the dirbe annual average value ( see table 7 ) .",

    "assuming a grain emissivity index of 1.5 , a flux ratio @xmath29 actually corresponds to a dust temperature of @xmath32 k whereas a ratio of 3.1 corresponds to a temperature of about 25 k. this seems to indicate that our source , hunnsa57_1 , might have a dust component with a temperature of about 65 k , maybe harbouring an active galactic nucleus .",
    "the detailed characteristics of this and the other sources will be discussed further in paper ii dealing with the individual sources supplemented by optical images and spectra .",

    "first we have included 100 @xmath1 m counts from the iras psc ( beichman et al .",
    "@xcite ) which are the only published 100 @xmath1 m number counts from iras and secondly we have included source counts of the hh87 sources with moderate - quality 100 @xmath1 m flux excluding of course ngc 6543 and another source noted by hh87 to be cirrus .",
    "it is important to note that the 100 @xmath1 m sources from hh87 do not represent an independent sample but are instead 100 @xmath1 m fluxes determined at the positions of the detected 60 @xmath1 m sources .",
    "finally we have multiplied the flux scale of the 60 @xmath1 m counts shown in fig .",
    "10 by a factor of 2.4 .",

    "it has been confirmed to us that such a scaling is viable since the area coverage for the 60 @xmath1 m and 100 @xmath1 m number counts is identical ( t. chester , ipac , private communication ) .",
    "the iras 100 @xmath1 m and isophot c_90 filter exhibit fairly similar spectral response and we have verified that the scaling factor 2.4 is valid to within a few percent at least for low redshift galaxies ( @xmath37 ) with dust temperatures in the range 30 - 40 k and grain emissivity indices ranging from 1 to 2 .",
    "this also implies that the iras 100 @xmath1 m number counts can be directly compared with the isophot 90 @xmath1 m data . as in fig .",
    "10 the previously published source count data plotted in fig .",
    "11 are shown without error bars except for the faintest bin of the hacking & houck ( @xcite ) and gregorich et al .",

    "10 it can be seen that the sparseness of our data do not allow us to make any strong statements about the 60 @xmath1 m population . with our 60 @xmath1 m detection limit of 90 mjy at the formal snr of 6.75 it is noteworthy that we do not find any sources in the flux range from 236 mjy to 90 mjy",

    "<S> we present here the results of a deep survey in a 0.4 deg@xmath0 blank field in selected area 57 conducted with the isophot instrument aboard esas infrared space observatory ( iso ) at both 60 @xmath1 m and 90 @xmath1 m . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting sky maps have a spatial resolution of 15 @xmath2 23 arcsrc@xmath0 per pixel which is much higher than the 90 @xmath2 90 arcsec@xmath0 pixels of the iras all sky survey . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the main instrumental effects encountered in our data , outline our data reduction and analysis scheme and present astrometry and photometry of the detected point sources . </S>",
    "<S> with a formal signal to noise ratio of 6.75 we have source detection limits of 90 mjy at 60 @xmath1 m and 50 mjy at 90 @xmath1 m . </S>",
    "<S> to these limits we find cumulated number densities of 5@xmath3 deg@xmath4 at 60 @xmath1 m and 14.8@xmath5 deg@xmath4 at 90 @xmath1 m . </S>",
    "<S> these number densities of sources are found to be lower than previously reported results from iso but the data do not allow us to discriminate between no - evolution scenarios and various evolutionary models . </S>"
