    "[ tsacs ] ) . similar behavior",

    ", we showed that the scattering cross section at small angles @xmath118 is still dominated by the `` schwarzschild term '' @xmath119 [ cf .",
    "( [ wfscs ] ) ] .",
    "black hole charge leads only to a subdominant correction term proportional to @xmath120 at small angles .",
    "however , the black hole charge does have a significant effect upon the cross section observed at large angles ( figs .",
    "[ scs - wm1 ] and  [ scs - wm3 ] ) .",
    "we found that the angular width of the so - called spiral scattering oscillations increases with @xmath35 .",
    "in particular , the glory peak becomes wider as @xmath35 increases ( fig .",
    "[ glory comp ] ) .",
    "these effects are related to the fact that the radius of the photon orbit shrinks as @xmath35 increases .    in principle , highly accurate measurements of , for example , the gravitational wave flux scattered by a black hole could one day be used to estimate black hole s charge .",
    "a more immediate possibility is that scattering and absorption patterns may be observed with black hole analogue systems created in the laboratory  @xcite .",
