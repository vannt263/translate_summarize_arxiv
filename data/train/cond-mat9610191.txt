    "many amorphous substances exhibit linear behavior in an arrhenius plot of the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 , or the mobility @xmath1 of particles , where @xmath2 , or @xmath3 , is presented as a function of the inverse temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the observation of an arrhenian temperature - dependence is not easily understandable from the theory of diffusion in disordered crystals .",
    "the commonly used models of diffusion of particles in lattices with disordered transition rates predict different behavior : the random - trap model predicts generally convex ( downward ) curvature of @xmath2 versus @xmath5 , independent of the lattice dimension @xmath6 , while the random - barrier model gives concave ( upward ) curvature for three- and higher - dimensional lattices .",
    "limoge and bocquet @xcite suggested that the apparent arrhenius behavior of @xmath2 versus @xmath5 might be due to a compensation of the effects of random barriers and random traps .",
    "the aim of this paper is the examination of this appealing proposition by analytical and numerical methods .",
    "the analytical arguments given by limoge and bocquet @xcite in support of a compensation of the effects of random barriers and of random traps are only partially satisfactory .",
    "they employed continuous - time random - walk theory and used a decoupling approximation when performing the disorder average .",
    "this procedure gives correct results for the random - trap model .",
    "for the random - barrier model , however , the ensuing results are not correct , as a consequence of the neglect of important backward correlations in the transitions of the particles .",
    "the failure of the decoupling approximation for the random - barrier model in comparison to the monte carlo results was already discused in @xcite .",
    "recently a new exact result for the diffusion coefficient of particles in one - dimensional disordered chains has been found @xcite .",
    "the expression contains transition rates that are weighted by the equilibrium occupancies of the sites ; this is relevant for random site energies , i.  e. , random traps .",
    "the insight obtained from this result can serve as a basis for approximate treatments of models with site and barrier disorder in higher dimensions , as will be shown here in form of an effective - medium approximation ( ema ) .",
    "very recently limoge and bocquet @xcite tried to take the inherent backward correlations of the random - barrier model into account .",
    "the differences between their and our results will be discussed below .    in the remainder of the introduction we present qualitative arguments for the different curvatures in the simple models .",
    "the downward curvature of @xmath2 versus @xmath5 for the random - trap model is easily understood : the deepest trap sites with the lowest energies dominate the behavior at the lowest temperatures .",
    "the convex curvature can be deduced formally from the exact expression for the disorder - averaged diffusion coefficient @xmath0 ( see below ) , which is valid in all dimensions @xmath6 .",
    "the argument for the random - barrier model is more complicated . at the lowest temperatures , where the ratio of the width of the barrier energy distribution and the thermal energy is large , the diffusion coefficient is determined by the highest barrier along a critical path of bond percolation @xcite .",
    "the path may be constructed by selecting successively bonds with the lowest barriers possible until the `` infinite '' cluster in the lattice appears . if the temperature is raised , additional paths contribute to the diffusivity .",
    "these paths comprise also higher barriers , hence the apparent activation energy is increased .    in the following section we describe the derivation of the exact result for @xmath0 in disordered linear chains from an expression for the mean first - passage time . in sec .",
    "3 we give an analytical treatment of the combination of independent random barriers and random traps . sec .  4 contains the ema for the combined model in @xmath7 . in sec .",
    "5 we present our conclusions from the results .",
    "recently an exact expression for the asymptotic diffusion coefficient of single particles on linear chains with disordered transition rates has been derived @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a first - passage time method was used while in @xcite the mobility of particles on chains with periodic boundary conditions was derived from the linear response to a driving force .",
    "we follow reference @xcite for the derivation .",
    "the basis is an exact expression for the mean first - passage time of a particle from site 0 to site @xmath9 on a segment of a disordered chain @xcite .",
    "site 0 is regarded as reflecting , while site @xmath9 is an absorbing site .",
    "the expression reads @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the transition rate from site @xmath12 to site @xmath13 ; the transitions being restricted to nearest neighbors . note that ( [ gt0n ] ) gives @xmath14 for a particular ( quenched ) realization of the disordered segment .",
    "we now invoke the condition of detailed balance between two neighbor sites , @xmath15 the thermal occupation factors @xmath16 are defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy of site @xmath12 , counted negative from a common origin .",
    "the curly brackets in ( [ occ ] ) designate the average over the disordered site energies , for finite segments @xmath19 the occupation factors are proportional to the thermal equilibrium occupation probabilities of the sites ; due to the normalization used they can be larger or smaller than one .    the condition of detailed balance holds in equilibrium , and the occupation factors @xmath16 exist for finite segments when all nearest - neighbor transition rates @xmath20 .",
    "we have to require that unique occupation factors also exist in the limit @xmath21 .",
    "this requirement excludes certain interesting models , for instance the sinai model @xcite , from the further derivations .",
    "however , it is fulfilled for the models considered in the next section .    when the condition of detailed balance ( [ detb ] ) is introduced into expression ( [ gt0n ] ) a considerable simplification",
    "is achieved : @xmath22 taking the disorder average of the equation , we find as the leading term in the limit of long segments , @xmath23 , @xmath24 this equation can be interpreted as the inverted relation between time and mean - squared displacements of random walks on disordered lattices , @xmath25 .",
    "we hence deduce the following asymptotic diffusion coefficient from ( [ gt0nlimit ] ) @xmath26 under the assumption of the existence of unique occupation factors one can also derive , for large @xmath9 , using again detailed balance @xmath27 since @xmath28 , the relative dispersion of the disorder average of the mean first - passage times vanishes as @xmath29 for long segments .",
    "one can say that @xmath30 becomes `` sharp '' in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath9 . in this way",
    "the use of the inverted relation ( [ gt0nlimit ] ) to deduce the diffusion coefficient can be justified .",
    "the physical significance of the result ( [ dex1 ] ) is that the diffusion coefficient follows from thermally weighted transition rates .",
    "a numerical verification of ( [ dex1 ] ) for the miller - abrahams model @xcite in @xmath31 has been given in reference @xcite .",
    "we now investigate a model for hopping diffusion of particles in lattices with combinations of random barriers and random traps . the random - barrier ( rb ) model is defined with symmetric transition rates @xmath32 between neighbor sites , @xmath33 . an arrhenius form for the transition rates",
    "is assumed , @xmath34 the energetic barrier @xmath35 between sites @xmath12 and @xmath36 is a random variable and it is taken from a common distribution @xmath37 . to avoid problems with negative barriers",
    "we restrict the range of the barrier energies to @xmath38 .",
    "the random - trap ( rt ) model is defined by rates @xmath39 that originate from the sites @xmath12 and are independent from the final sites . also here",
    "the arrhenius form is assumed , @xmath40 where @xmath18 is the energy of site @xmath12 .",
    "the site energies will be counted negative and the range be restricted to @xmath41 . again",
    "the individual site energies are selected from a common distribution @xmath42 .",
    "we introduce a combination of the rt and rb models by specifying the transition rates between two neighbor sites as @xmath43\\ ] ] the energy @xmath35 with two site indices refers to the barrier @xmath44 while the energy @xmath18 with one index refers to the site @xmath12 .",
    "( to distinguish between barrier and site energies , we sometimes keep dummy site indices ) .",
    "a pictorial representation of the model is given in figure 1 .",
    "note that the model is different from the miller - abrahams model @xcite where the site energy of the terminal site @xmath36 appears explicitly .",
    "the occupation factors @xmath16 are required in the weighted transition rates that appear in ( [ dex1 ] ) ; they are given in ( [ occ ] ) .",
    "the weighted transition rates are then @xmath45 the numerator contains only barrier energies while the site energies only appear in the denominator , which can be evaluated directly . an immediate consequence of ( [ trw ] ) is the expression for the diffusion coefficient of the rt model , @xmath46 when barrier disorder is absent . equation ( [ rtd ] ) follows from ( [ dex1 ] ) in @xmath8 ; it is valid in all dimensions @xcite .",
    "another consequence of eq .",
    "( [ rtd ] ) is that the derivative of @xmath47 with respect to the inverse temperature @xmath48 is given by the mean thermal energy .",
    "since the mean thermal energy can only decrease with decreasing temperature , the slope of @xmath49 $ ] is decreasing with increasing @xmath48 .",
    "an exact result is obtained from ( [ dex1 ] ) for the diffusion coefficient of the combined rb and rt model in @xmath8 , @xmath50 equation ( [ comb1 ] ) can be cast into another form , @xmath51 the diffusion coefficient @xmath52 exhibits generally downward curvature in an arrhenius plot . since the average that determines the diffusion coefficient @xmath53 in @xmath8 has the same form as the one determining @xmath52 , downward curvature is also present in the arrhenius plot of this coefficient .",
    "also the diffusion coefficient of the combined model has then downward curvature in @xmath8 . in other words ,",
    "a compensation of the effects of random barriers and random traps is never possible in @xmath8 .      the diffusion coefficient of particles in the random - barrier model in simple - square lattices is exactly known for symmetric barrier - energy distributions @xmath37 @xcite . for symmetric energy distributions",
    "the diffusion coefficient is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the medium value of the energy distribution .",
    "hence @xmath53 does not show curvature in an arrhenius plot .",
    "consequently , the diffusion coefficient of the combined model will exhibit downward curvature in simple - square lattices .",
    "approximations are necessary to derive the asymptotic diffusion coefficients in higher - dimensional disordered lattices .",
    "it is very plausible that the weighted transition rates ( [ trw ] ) should also be used in approximate treatments .",
    "site - energy and barrier disorder can be treated independently when they are uncorrelated . under this assumption , the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ trw ] ) only contains uncorrelated barrier energies .",
    "the ema gives reasonably accurate results for the rb model when the disorder is not very strong .",
    "hence we will use this approximation to deal with the barrier disorder in @xmath56 . in the ema , an effective transition rate @xmath57",
    "is determined from a self - consistency condition @xcite , @xmath58 the transition rate @xmath59 is a random variable , here it is taken according to eq .",
    "( [ trw ] ) .",
    "the rate @xmath59 is symmetric as a consequence of detailed balance ; this symmetry is required for the application of eq .",
    "( [ self ] ) .",
    "the curly brackets indicate the disorder average which extends over the barrier disorder .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is identical to @xmath57 and the lattice constant in the hypercubic lattices that we study is set unity .    since the exact result ( [ rtd ] ) for @xmath52",
    "is contained as a factor in the weighted transition rates , we have in ema @xmath60 the ema becomes exact in the limit of coordination number @xmath61 , i.  e. , in infinite - dimensional disordered lattices .",
    "we obtain in this limit @xmath62 the second average is proportional to the average over the rates corresponding to the random barriers .",
    "for the rb model and in @xmath63 we have @xmath64 , hence the product form of @xmath65 ( [ comb2 ] ) is also valid in infinite dimensions",
    ". we conjecture that ( [ comb2 ] ) is generally valid if the site and barrier energies are uncorrelated .",
    "very recently limoge and bocquet incorporated the backward correlations of the rb model and derived a self - consistency condition for the effective transition rate .",
    "however , their self - consistency condition is different from the standard form ( [ gselfconsis ] ) of the ema and does neither reproduce the exact one - dimensional ( section [ kresult1d ] ) nor the exact two - dimensional result ( [ gdrb2dsym ] ) .      in this subsection we study the possibility for a complete compensation of the curvatures resulting from the rt and rb models . for this purpose",
    "we consider first the case of infinite dimensions , @xmath66 . to obtain complete compensation of the curvatures ,",
    "a special relationship between the site and barrier energy distributions must exist . to determine this relation",
    ", we require that the following equation represents simple arrhenian behavior of the diffusion coefficient , @xmath67 with a temperature - independent activation energy @xmath68 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath42 is restricted to the energy interval [ @xmath69 with @xmath70 a positive quantity .",
    "if we identify @xmath70 with @xmath71 we can show by simple manipulations of the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ req ] ) that it is satisfied when @xmath72 the barrier distribution is then restricted to the interval [ @xmath73 and it is simply the trap distribution shifted by @xmath71 .",
    "the argument implies that complete compensation , in @xmath74 , is only possible for energy distributions that are restricted to a finite interval .",
    "of particular interest are distributions that are symmetric about the midpoint of the interval .",
    "of course it is not necessary that the distributions are unequal zero on the whole interval .    for finite dimensions",
    "@xmath75 the diffusion coefficient @xmath53 has to be determined by approximations , for instance by the ema .",
    "it is a complicated functional of the energy distribution @xmath37 and no general result can be obtained .",
    "it seems very implausible that complete compensation can be achieved in general .",
    "however , it appears always possible , in dimensions @xmath7 , to choose the energy distributions @xmath42 and @xmath37 in such a way that an approximate arrhenian behavior is achieved in a restricted temperature interval .",
    "in this section we present ema results for the combined model in @xmath76 and 5 for different forms of the disorder and various temperatures .",
    "the results are compared with monte - carlo simulations of the diffusion coefficient by measuring the mean - square displacement @xmath77 where the asymptotic diffusion coefficient @xmath0 is given by @xmath78 actually we present the whole proportionality factor @xmath79 as the diffusion coefficient in the figures to make results in different dimensions comparable .",
    "compensatory effects between random barriers and random traps are now discussed .",
    "we first calculate @xmath80 for uniform distributions of energies ( for the rb model see @xcite ) , @xmath81 where @xmath82 by comparison with the numerical simulations we find that using @xmath83 approximate arrhenian behavior is reached . in figure 2",
    "results of monte carlo simulations are shown together with the ema results ( [ gemauni ] ) with parameters chosen according to ( [ gstsb ] ) .",
    "the upward curvature for the rb model is stronger in @xmath84 than in @xmath85 although the width of the distribution is the same .",
    "the compensation works in the case of a stronger curvature for the rb and rt models because for larger coordination numbers compensation becomes generally easier .",
    "the effect of the coordination number on the possibility of compensation of barrier and site - energy disorder was already noted in @xcite .",
    "we consider as a second energy distribution the gaussian distribution , @xmath86 we have to cut off the tails of one side of the distributions to get only negative respectively positive energy values .",
    "we decided to cut off 5% of the distributions .",
    "therefore we take @xmath55 according to @xmath87 where erf ( ) is the error function . for this",
    "distributions the self - consistency condition ( [ self ] ) has to be solved numerically .",
    "results are shown in figure 3 .",
    "for this example the two curves for the rt model lie on top of each other because we took the same width in @xmath85 and @xmath88 and then determined the width of the barrier distribution to get compensation in the combined model .",
    "again the upward curvature of the rb model is stronger in @xmath84 than in @xmath85 although we took a smaller width of the barrier distribution in the higher dimension .",
    "nonetheless compensation of the curvature is still possible and the numerical procedure to find the correct parameters of the distribution for the best possible compensation is even more stable in the higher dimension . though the curves of the combined model in figure 3 look linear , the numerical results show that no perfect compensation is possible .",
    "our theory of the diffusion coefficients of models with combined site - energy and barrier disorder was based on weighted transition rates where the thermal site occupancies enter explicitly . due to the exponential form of the assumed arrhenius law for the individual transition rates , the contributions from the site energies and the barrier energies factorize .",
    "if the site - energy and barrier disorder are uncorrelated , the resulting diffusion coefficient factorizes into the random - trap and random - barrier contributions .",
    "a consequence is that compensation of the effects of random site - energies and random barriers on the curvature in an arrhenius plot of @xmath65 versus @xmath5 is not possible in @xmath8 and @xmath89 .",
    "the simple - square lattice represents a boundary case .",
    "partial compensation is possible in a finite temperature interval in 3 and higher dimensions , if the strength of the disordered site and barrier energies is adjusted properly ( stronger disorder in the barriers than in the site - energies for finite dimensions @xmath7 ) .    in this context we should mention that our conclusions refer to the hypercubic lattices ( square , simple - cubic , etc . ) .",
    "the relevant parameter for the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient in the rb model is the coordination number @xmath90 .",
    "lattices with @xmath91 were investigated by limoge and bocquet @xcite .",
    "point i ) may be somewhat alleviated by including short - range correlations , but point ii ) seems to be generally necessary .",
    "we leave the question open whether the points i ) and ii ) are reasonable descriptions of real amorphous substances .",
    "instead we point to one serious deficiency of the present theories of diffusion in disordered system .",
    "the present theories are based on regular lattices with the disorder put into the transition rates .",
    "real materials have topologically disordered structures .",
    "there exist a range of coordination numbers of the equilibrium sites , and the jump distances vary considerably .",
    "the treatment of these effects remains as a task for the future .",
