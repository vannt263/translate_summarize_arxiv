    "the purpose of this article is to continue the investigation , initiated in [ rh ] , of the relationship between the representation theories of the hecke algebra @xmath3 of type @xmath1 and of the blob algebra @xmath4 .",
    "the hecke algebra @xmath5 of type @xmath1 is a well - known two - parameter deformation of the hyperoctahedral group whereas the blob algebra @xmath6 , introduced in [ ms ] from motivations in statistical mechanics , is a diagram algebra of marked ( blobbed ) temperley - lieb diagrams .",
    "a main point of our work , already present in [ rh ] , is that @xmath2 can also be realized as a quotient of @xmath7 thus making the @xmath2-representations @xmath7-representations by inflation .",
    "viewing @xmath2 as a quotient of @xmath7 is analogous to viewing the temperley - lieb algebra @xmath8 as a quotient of the hecke algebra of type @xmath9 , and indeed @xmath2 is also sometimes called the temperley - lieb algebra of type @xmath10 .",
    "dipper - james - murphy introduced in [ djm ] for each bipartition @xmath11 of total degree @xmath12 a specht module @xmath13 for @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the kernel of the quotient map @xmath15 .",
    "we then showed in [ rh ] that @xmath16 as long as @xmath17 is a one - line bipartition and so these @xmath13 factor over the quotient map to become @xmath2-modules .",
    "one might now suspect that @xmath18 is a standard module for the quasi - hereditary algebra @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , we showed that many properties of the standard modules are shared by the @xmath18 , but somewhat surprisingly we could prove in [ rh ] that they do not verify the relevant universal property and so do not identify with standard modules , except in trivial cases .",
    "recall that g. lusztig s monograph [ lu2 ] on the representation theory of hecke algebras with unequal parameters contains a construction of cells in the associated weyl group , generalizing the construction for one - parameter hecke algebras from [ kl ] . as a matter of fact",
    ", he gives for each choice of a total order on an abelian group @xmath19 , such that @xmath20 , a construction of a kazhdan - lusztig type basis of @xmath7 that induces a corresponding cell partition of the weyl group .",
    "to each of these cells there is an associated cell module of the hecke algebra . in [ bgil ] a series a conjectures were formulated for type @xmath1 which , if true , would put a high degree of structure on this .",
    "assume that @xmath21 and that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are positive in @xmath24 . according to the conjectures",
    ", the setting should give rise to a _ cellular algebra _",
    "datum on @xmath7 in the sense of graham and lehrer , where the underlying poset @xmath25 should be the set of bipartitions @xmath26 of total degree @xmath12 with partial order and map @xmath27 defined in terms of a certain _ domino insertion _ algorithm , depending on @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , by the work of bonnaf and jacon [ bj ] , the different cellular algebra structures on @xmath7 should account for the different ways of parameterizing the simple modules for @xmath7 that are given by ariki s theorem in [ a ] .",
    "these conjectures have only been fully proved in the so - called asymptotic case @xmath28 , see [ bi ] , where the cell modules turn out to be the ones given by dipper - james - murphy . in this work",
    "we focus on the case @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this is another extreme case since @xmath32 and so @xmath33 in the [ bgil ] notation .",
    "we show that the poset structure on @xmath26 in this case is compatible with the quasi - hereditary order on the category of @xmath34-modules when restricted to one - line bipartitions , the map being given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we show that the ideal @xmath14 is generated by the set of kazhdan - lusztig elements @xmath38 for which @xmath39 does not correspond to a one - line bipartition .",
    "we moreover show that the cell module given by the one - line bipartition @xmath40 is isomorphic to the @xmath2 standard module @xmath41 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 . to summarize our findings : the @xmath42 case of the [ bgil ] conjectures induces the blob algebra category when restricted to one - line bipartitions .",
    "this given , the algorithm described in [ ja ] can be used to answer the question that was raised in [ rh ] , namely to describe the kleshchev bipartition that corresponds to the simple @xmath2-module @xmath43 .",
    "let us indicate the layout of the article .",
    "the first section contains a combinatorial analysis of the domino insertion algorithm already mentioned above .",
    "the main result is a characterization of the elements @xmath44 of the weyl group @xmath45 of type @xmath1 that go to two - line tableaux under domino insertion .",
    "this characterization uses the coxeter presentation of @xmath45 .",
    "the section relies on results of taskin , [ t ] .    in the next section we recall the presentation of @xmath2 as a quotient of @xmath7 and",
    "show that the defining ideal is given by the kazhdan - lusztig type elements @xmath46 where @xmath47 . in the following section we show our main results , identifying the cell modules with the standard modules . to be more precise ,",
    "we show that the cell modules verify the universal property for the standard modules , given within the framework of the globalization - localization formalism .",
    "for this to work we rely on lusztig s results in [ lu1 ] that we combine with the results of fan and green [ fg ] on type @xmath9 .",
    "finally , in the last section we show how the fock space approach to the representation theory of @xmath7 can be used to reprove the main results of [ mw ] and to obtain the kleshchev bipartitions of the simple modules of @xmath2 .",
    "in this section we first fix some basic notation that shall be used throughout the article .",
    "we then investigate the domino insertion algorithm for the weyl group of type @xmath1 .",
    "we describe the elements that are mapped to two - line partitions , that is domino tableaux in less than two lines .",
    "let @xmath45 be the weyl group of type @xmath48 .",
    "it is a coxeter group on generators @xmath49 with relations @xmath50 let @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "then @xmath45 can also be described as the subgroup of the symmetric group on the elements @xmath54 generated by @xmath55 and @xmath56 in cycle notation .",
    "we shall adopt the convention that cycles are multiplied from right to left .",
    "the subgroup of @xmath45 generated by @xmath57 is the symmetric group @xmath58 .    for elements @xmath59 we shall also use word notation @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "by this we mean that @xmath39 acts in the following way on @xmath62 @xmath63 and then also necessarily @xmath64 .",
    "in this setting we use the standard notation @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "thus @xmath67 appears in @xmath68 if and only if @xmath69 does not not appear .",
    "it is normally clear whether a given @xmath59 is written as a product of coxeter generators or as a word over @xmath70 and we shall therefore generally not mention explicitly the chosen form . for example @xmath71",
    "we denote by @xmath72 the bruhat - chevalley order on @xmath73 where by convention the neutral element @xmath74 is the smallest of all .",
    "assume that @xmath75 .",
    "then the following conditions describe the right descent set of @xmath39 with respect to @xmath72 see eg .",
    "[ bb ] @xmath76 if @xmath59 is written in word from , its right descent set can be used to write it as a reduced expression in the coxeter generators @xmath77 . .",
    "assume that @xmath78 .",
    "then @xmath79 is a reduced expression for @xmath39 obtained from the above description of the right descent set . indeed , @xmath80 moves @xmath81 past @xmath82 , then @xmath83 changes @xmath84 to @xmath85 and finally @xmath86 changes @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",
    "we shall throughout be specially interested in @xmath89 which we define as the subset of @xmath45 consisting of those @xmath39 that have no reduced expressions @xmath90 that contain a subexpression @xmath91 of the form @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "thus the subexpression @xmath94 is allowed whereas @xmath86 is not .",
    "our aim is to describe the image of @xmath95 under the domino insertion correspondence described for example in [ bgil ] . in order to do",
    "so we first need a description of @xmath95 in terms of words",
    ". this description will only be indirect , but for our purposes this will be sufficient .",
    "[ first_lemma ] assume that @xmath59 and assume that it can be written as follows @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "then @xmath98 if and only if @xmath99    proof suppose that @xmath98 and define @xmath100 by @xmath101 using the above description of the right descent set we get that @xmath39 has a reduced expression of the form @xmath102 and the second statement follows , since any reduced expression for @xmath103 can be extended to a reduced expression for @xmath104 .",
    "if now @xmath105 is not satisfied then by the description of the right descent set there will be an index @xmath106 such that @xmath107 .",
    "but by formula ( @xmath108 ) this contradicts the assumption that @xmath98 .    to show the other implication we assume that @xmath109 holds , that @xmath110 and that @xmath111 .",

    "define @xmath125 .",
    "then it is known that @xmath126 corresponds under the robinson - schensted correspondence to pairs of partitions of at most two lines .",

    "proof suppose first that @xmath98 .",
    "we generalize @xmath134 as follows @xmath136 by the proof of the previous lemma we have @xmath137 for all @xmath120",
    "and so we get the inequalities @xmath133 by using the previous lemma recursively .",
    "but @xmath138 and so we have proved one implication of the theorem .",
    "the other implication follows in a similar way from the previous lemma .",
    "the notion of domino tableaux shall be important to us .",
    "a domino tableau is the young diagram of an integer partition of @xmath139 with node set partioned into dominoes , that is horizontally or vertically neighboring nodes .",
    "the dominoes are labeled with numbers @xmath140 .",
    "a domino tableau is called standard if the labeling is increasing from left to the right and from top to bottom .",
    "let @xmath141 denote the set of standard domino tableaux in @xmath12 dominoes .",
    "below is an example from @xmath142 .",
    "we define @xmath143 . for @xmath144",
    "we let @xmath145 denote the shape of its underlying partition .",
    "let @xmath146 be the set @xmath147 the domino insertion algorithm establishes a bijection between @xmath45 and @xmath146 .",
    "it can be viewed as a generalization of the robinson - schensted algorithm . we shall not here give a precise description of the algorithm , but refer the reader to for instance [ bgil ] .",
    "let us denote by @xmath148 the pair of domino tableaux associated with @xmath59 under domino insertion .",
    "we say that @xmath39 and @xmath103 belong to the same knuth ( plactic ) class , or @xmath149 , if @xmath150 .",
    "dually , we say that @xmath39 and @xmath103 belong to the same dual knuth ( coplactic ) class , or @xmath151 , if @xmath152 .    in this",
    "setting , taskin considers in [ t ] the following relations on the elements of @xmath45 in word form , generalizing the knuth relations @xmath153",
    "@xmath154 @xmath155 where @xmath156 is any bijection such that @xmath157 .",
    "he proves the following theorem .",
    "[ taskin ] suppose @xmath158 .",
    "then they belong to the same plactic class if and only if there is a sequence @xmath159 such that @xmath160 and @xmath161 or @xmath162 for @xmath163 .",
    "the dual knuth relations are defined by @xmath164 if @xmath165 .",
    "if @xmath39 and @xmath103 are written in word form , they do not act on neighboring elements , and as a matter of fact , they do not admit as simple a description as in the symmetric group case . on the other hand , since @xmath166 the previous theorem has an obvious dual version :    [ dual_taskin ] suppose @xmath158 .",
    "then they belong to the same coplactic class if and only if there is a sequence @xmath167 such that @xmath160 and @xmath168 or @xmath169 for @xmath170",
    ".    the following lemma will be useful .",
    "[ w_b stable ] @xmath171 is stable under the knuth relations ( [ first_knuth ] ) , ( [ second_knuth ] ) and ( [ third_knuth ] ) .",
    "proof assume that @xmath98 and write it in the form @xmath172 where @xmath173 are words , possibly empty , over @xmath128 for @xmath174 and @xmath175 for @xmath174 . write @xmath176 let us first verify that the knuth relations ( [ first_knuth ] ) and ( [ second_knuth ] ) map @xmath39 to another element of @xmath171 .",
    "assume first that ( [ first_knuth ] ) acts in the @xmath177 part of @xmath104 .",
    "we know from theorem [ first_thm ] that all @xmath178 are increasing sequences over @xmath128 and that @xmath179 where the inequalities hold for all elements of the subsequences , and so the pattern @xmath180 can only occur if @xmath181 for some @xmath182 and @xmath183 for some @xmath184 .",
    "but then clearly ( [ first_knuth ] ) takes @xmath131 to another element of @xmath44 .",
    "likewise we see that ( [ first_knuth ] ) acting in the pattern @xmath185 of @xmath186 takes @xmath187 to another element of @xmath95 .    in the case of the knuth relation ( [ second_knuth ] ) acting in @xmath177 we argue similarly . by the inequalities ( [ we_know ] ) , the only decreasing subsequences of @xmath186 are of the form @xmath188 for some @xmath189 and so in the pattern @xmath190 we have that @xmath191 for some @xmath192 whereas @xmath193 for some @xmath194 .",
    "but since @xmath195 is less than @xmath196 it must be @xmath197 for some @xmath198 and so changing @xmath190 to @xmath199 gives another element of @xmath44 .",
    "we argue similarly in case of the pattern @xmath199 .",
    "certainly , only the knuth relations ( [ first_knuth ] ) and ( [ second_knuth ] ) can act in the @xmath103 part of @xmath39 .",
    "but by the theory of the usual robinson - schensted algorithm , the knuth relations ( [ first_knuth ] ) and ( [ second_knuth ] ) preserve the length of the longest decreasing subsequence when acting on words over @xmath128 .",
    "hence we get from theorem [ first_thm ] that they map @xmath131 to @xmath95 .",
    "we finally consider the case where the action of the knuth relations involves both @xmath200 and @xmath103 .",
    "the relevant knuth relations are then only ( [ first_knuth ] ) and ( [ second_knuth ] ) and @xmath201 must occur in first or second position of the relation .    * case @xmath202 * : this case does not occur since @xmath195 would belong to @xmath103 and would be less than @xmath201 , which contradicts the fact that @xmath103 is a word over @xmath203 .",

    ". thus also @xmath216 .",
    "the application of the knuth relation ( [ second_knuth ] ) changes @xmath210 to @xmath217 and hence @xmath208 changes to @xmath218 . but no element of @xmath208 can be bigger than @xmath212 for if @xmath219 were such an element than we may assume it is the last one of @xmath208 and @xmath220 would be a decreasing subsequence longer than three , inside @xmath221 . thus @xmath218 is increasing and we are done in this case as well .",
    "* case @xmath217 * : we have @xmath211 . using the knuth relation ( [ second_knuth ] ) it changes to @xmath210 and thus @xmath222 changes to @xmath223 which is clearly increasing .",
    "we now finally check that also the third knuth relation ( [ third_knuth ] ) takes @xmath39 to an element of @xmath44 . using theorem [ first_thm ]",
    "we see that it only acts in @xmath39 if the first two elements of @xmath39 are either on the form @xmath224 with @xmath225 or @xmath226 with @xmath227 .",
    "but the relation ( [ third_knuth ] ) interchanges these two , thus finishing the proof of the lemma .",
    "@xmath44 is a union of plactic classes and also a union of coplactic classes .",
    "proof the previous lemma amounts to saying that @xmath95 is a union of plactic classes . but",

    "there is @xmath100 related to @xmath39 through a series of knuth or dual knuth relations such that @xmath235 and @xmath236 both have one of the forms         depending on the parity of the first line of @xmath237 . under the domino insertion algorithm",
    ", the first tableau corresponds to @xmath238 whereas the second tableau corresponds to @xmath239 since they both belong to @xmath95 we deduce from lemma [ w_b stable ] that @xmath39 also belongs to @xmath95 and one implication of the theorem is proved .    to prove the other implication we take @xmath98 and",

    "if @xmath261 must also be entered in the two - line part of the tableau , the resulting tableau will look as follows        where once again a vertical domino becomes horizontal and a horizontal becomes vertical . since the sequence @xmath246 is increasing this pattern is repeated until arriving at the elements that must be inserted in the one - line part of the tableau .",
    "these are inserted by bumping horizontal dominoes to the second line , giving tableaux of the form        we next describe the insertion of the other elements of @xmath254 , those from @xmath249 .",
    "but this is much simpler , since the element to be inserted will always be bigger than those so far inserted .",
    "it is therefore inserted as a horizontal domino at the end of the first line , without bumping .",
    "this last description also shows that in general , when @xmath254 is a more complicated shuffle of @xmath246 and @xmath249 , the insertion of the elements of @xmath249 , does not influence the insertion of the elements of @xmath246 .",
    "we have thus proved that the insertion of all elements of @xmath254 gives a two - line domino tableau .",

    "but the elements of @xmath262 are all bigger than the elements of @xmath263 and so they are inserted as horizontal dominoes at the end of @xmath264 . to be precise ,",
    "the resulting domino tableau is simply the concatenation of the lines of @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "the theorem is proved .    in the remaining part of this section ,",

    "the proof of our next theorem is essentially the same as the proof of theorem 4.7 of [ bj ] , but notice that theorem 4.7 of [ bj ] requires the validity of the conjectures a , b and @xmath718 of [ bj ] .",
    "as already mentioned , conjecture a holds in the @xmath0 case whereas , as we shall see , we can replace conjecture b by theorem [ main ] and conjecture @xmath718 by our previous theorem [ grothendieck ] .",
    "[ bonnafe - jacon ] let @xmath719 be as above and let @xmath720 be the largest integer such that @xmath721 and set @xmath722 . then for @xmath723 we have @xmath724 moreover , identifying @xmath725 with @xmath726 we have for @xmath727 that @xmath728 = d_{\\lambda , \\mu}^s(1)\\ ] ]    proof by the choice of @xmath184 we have formula ( [ crystal_order ] ) as in the proof of theorem 4.7 of [ bj ]",
    "notice now that @xmath729 .",
    "thus we have that @xmath275 and @xmath691 of ( [ flotw ] ) are flotw bipartitions , that is they belong to @xmath716 , see [ bj ] .",
    "take now @xmath730 corresponding to @xmath731 . according to ariki s theorem",
    "there exists @xmath723 such that the decomposition number @xmath732 $ ] satisfies @xmath733 =   d_{\\lambda , \\nu }   = d_{\\lambda , \\mu}^s(1)\\ ] ] for all @xmath734 where we used theorem [ grothendieck ] for the first equality . setting @xmath735 we get that @xmath736 and setting @xmath737 we get that @xmath738 . hence @xmath739 and the theorem is proved .",
    "the next step is now to calculate the numbers @xmath740 for @xmath741 .",
    "uglov s proof of the existence of @xmath742 is not straightforward , but still constructive ; notice that the algorithm has been simplified by yvonne in [ y ] . on the other hand ,",
    "since we only focus on bipartitions in @xmath743 actually the properties of @xmath742 already mentioned are sufficient to calculate @xmath742 and hence @xmath740 .    indeed , set @xmath744 and recall from [ mw ] that the choices of @xmath745 and @xmath746 determine an alcove geometry in @xmath747 with zero dimensional walls in the integral points @xmath748 and fundamental alcove @xmath749 being the one that contains @xmath635",
    "the associated weyl group @xmath750 is infinite dihedral , generated by @xmath751 and @xmath752 where @xmath751 ( @xmath753 ) is the reflection in the right ( left ) wall of the fundamental alcove .",
    "set @xmath754 and for @xmath755 write @xmath756 for the alcove containing @xmath275 . for @xmath755 we define @xmath757 by the condition @xmath758 .",
    "thus @xmath759 in the bruhat - chevalley order implies @xmath760 in the quasi - hereditary order .",
    "we can now formulate the next theorem .",
    "the second part of it was proved in [ mw ] using completely different methods .",
    "proof following [ mw ] we enumerate the elements of @xmath750 as follows @xmath764 and define @xmath765 .",
    "then , @xmath766 is the alcove at distance @xmath67 from @xmath749 , positioned to the right if @xmath67 is positive and to the left if @xmath690 is negative .",
    "write @xmath767 such that @xmath768 .",
    "set furthermore @xmath769 .",
    "then the fundamental alcove is limited by @xmath770 and @xmath771 .",
    "assume now that @xmath772 belongs to @xmath773 with @xmath774 .",
    "let @xmath775 be the residues modulo @xmath745 of @xmath776 .",
    "we now act with elements of the form @xmath777 in @xmath670 and consider the images in @xmath778 where @xmath779 .",
    "these images move towards the right wall of @xmath766 .",
    "the wall will be reached when @xmath780 and the image will be @xmath781 where @xmath782 , i.e. with @xmath783 power equal to @xmath784 since @xmath785 .",
    "notice here that the wall @xmath786 of @xmath749 corresponds exactly to the second case in the definition of the order relation on the nodes .",
    "acting with @xmath787 in @xmath781 and considering the images in @xmath778 the result is @xmath788 where @xmath789 and @xmath790 and once again we get correspondence with the translation functor formalism .",
    "similarly , we go through the other cases and find that translation upwards through the wall behaves as above whereas translation downwards through the wall @xmath791 is given by @xmath792 where @xmath793 and @xmath794 are chosen analogously to the first case .    using these rules , together with ( [ crystal_order ] ) and theorem [ coideal ] it us now straightforward to calculate @xmath711 modulo @xmath795 for @xmath796 to obtain formula ( [ decom1 ] ) .",
    "finally , formula ( [ decom2 ] ) then follows from the previous theorem .",
    "let us finish by mentioning another application of our results .",
    "recall that the kleshchev bipartitions are those of @xmath797 where @xmath798 and @xmath799 , this is the so - called asymptotic case .",
    "the kleshchev bipartitions give the simple modules when we use the dipper - james - murphy specht modules to parameterize .    the question raised in [ rh ] of determining the kleshchev bipartition @xmath800 that corresponds to the simple @xmath2-module with parameter @xmath801",
    "can now be solved by applying kashiwara s operators to the crystal graphs of the fock spaces .",
    "consider as an example @xmath802 .",
    "then @xmath803 . in the crystal graph of @xmath804",
    "we have @xmath805 whereas the same sequence of crystal operators sends @xmath806 to @xmath807 in @xmath808 .",
    "jacon has constructed in [ ja ] an algorithm for converting between such crystal graphs .",
    "the following tables have been calculated using an implementation of his algorithm in the gap system .",
    "they convert between the bipartitions in @xmath809 and the corresponding kleshchev bipartitions , denoted @xmath810 .",
    "it can be seen that the correspondence between @xmath811 and @xmath812 works as the identity in the top @xmath813 lines of all of these tables .",
    "this is no coincidence .",
    "in fact it follows from lemma 2 of [ rh ] that the standard modules and the dipper - james - murphy specht modules coincide in these cases and hence also the simple modules .",
    "notice that the conditions of that lemma on @xmath814 to be odd and @xmath815 mod @xmath814 can be replaced by @xmath815 mod @xmath745 , as can easily be seen from the proof of the lemma .",
