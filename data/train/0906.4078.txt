    "the decay to muons of a light dilaton at the lhc can be a privileged channel to search for new physics .",
    "in particular , we consider conformal models with dilaton @xcite , in which the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is triggered by a spontaneously broken , nearly conformal sector .",
    "the dilaton , @xmath1 , is the pseudo - goldstone boson associated to the spontaneous breaking of the conformal symmetry and has higgs - like properties .",
    "when an explicit breaking of the conformal symmetry is introduced , dilaton couplings to light fermions , like muons , can receive significant enhancements that can notably improve the rate of a dilaton decaying to muons .",
    "the presence of enhancements in the dilaton couplings to light fermions is possible also when the dilaton is interpreted as the randall - sundrum radion @xcite ; the analysis we perform is perfectly applicable to this case .",
    "+ the dilaton higgs - like properties allow us to start the analysis from the study of a light higgs boson decaying to muons at the lhc .",
    "we retrace and optimize the analysis carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite . this process profits by the distinguishing dimuon signature @xcite . ] , but , in the sm , it is disadvantaged by the low branching ratio ( br ) for the higgs decaying to muons . however , the ewsb mechanism in the sm and , in particular , the sector concerning the higgs couplings to fermions is not explained and there are several hints , among which the excessive fine - tuning ( hierarchy problem ) for the higgs mass , to suggest an ewsb mechanism different from the usual one based on a single higgs doublet .",
    "the conformal model we investigate arises from these considerations . in the optics of possible variations from the sm in the higgs couplings to fermions ,",
    "the decay to muons of a light higgs becomes a very interesting channel of analysis and studies for the decay to muons of a light higgs produced via vector boson fusion ( vbf ) @xcite , gluon fusion @xcite and in association with @xmath2 pairs @xcite have been carried out .",
    "the results of these studies show comparable significance values ( about @xmath3 , for an integrated luminosity of @xmath4 at the lhc ) for the three different production channels , in the higgs mass range @xmath5 ; on the contrary , for greater higgs mass values , @xmath6 , the production in association with @xmath2 pairs display significance values smaller than those from the vbf and gluon fusion . among the latter production channels , we choose to focus on the vbf . the vbf production , contrary to what happens for the gluon fusion , does not proceed via loop induced couplings to the dilaton .",
    "this allows a study less affected by the unknown contribution from heavy resonances in the loop induced couplings @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we study , firstly , the decay to muons of a light higgs boson produced , in the sm , via vbf at the lhc , checking and optimizing the analysis in ref . @xcite . on the basis of the results obtained and taking into account theories beyond the sm predicting variations of the signal cross sections , we calculate the normalization factors @xmath7_{np}}{\\left[\\sigma(pp\\rightarrow h)br(h\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-})\\right]_{sm}}$ ] , needed to obtain a @xmath8 and a @xmath9 significance observation of the process , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath0 at the lhc .",
    "then , we focus on the conformal model with dilaton , taking into account the possibility of shifts in the dilaton yukawa coupling to muons .",
    "the normalization factors are correlated to the parameters of this new physics model .",
    "so , we find the discovery regions in the parameter space , for an integrated luminosity of @xmath0 at the lhc .",
    "we also take into account the tevatron @xmath10 upper limit for the process @xmath11 cross section @xcite and we derive exclusion zones for the conformal model parameters .",
    "we study in this section the higgs decaying to muons in vbf , @xmath12 , at the lhc with the center of mass energy @xmath13 .",
    "the signal selection criteria we apply in this analysis are also valid for the dilaton .",
    "we find the enhancement factors to the signal cross section necessary to obtain a @xmath8 and a @xmath9 observation , with @xmath0 at the lhc .",
    "we indicate such values as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "we ignore the reducible backgrounds : the @xmath19 production , the @xmath20 production and the @xmath21 production , that have negligible cross sections , once cuts are applied ( like it is shown in ref .",
    "the cuts we use to reduce these backgrounds are the following : @xmath22 these cuts have been fixed taking into account the detector acceptances @xcite and exploiting the distinguishing features of the production via vbf @xcite .",
    "indeed , the signal process is characterized by a particular topology , with two energetic jets , one forward and the other backward , emitted , on average , at high rapidity ( the limit on the jet rapidity is fixed at the value @xmath23 , taking into account the limitation on the hadronic calorimeter , @xmath24 , and the spread of the jets cone ) and with two isolated muons produced , on average , in the central rapidity region between the two tagging jets .",
    "then , the invariant mass of the jets generated by vbf mechanism is , on average , higher than the invariant mass of the jets coming from qcd background .",
    "the cuts also include limits on the muons transverse momentum , that derive from trigger issues , and a limitation on the muons invariant mass , that we impose to be included in the mass region centered on the higgs mass , @xmath25 , which is anticipated to capture @xmath26 of the signal cross section(like estimated in @xcite ) .",
    "the cuts on eq .",
    "( [ set_b ] ) are the same cuts adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite with the exception of the cuts on the jets transverse momentum , @xmath27 , and on the jets invariant mass , @xmath28 , that we have better optimized .",
    "we have taken into account several @xmath27 limit values higher than the @xmath29 value used in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to analyze the effects on signal - background ratios ( @xmath30 ) and significances .",
    "indeed , provided that significance and @xmath30 values do not suffer of remarkable reductions , it is preferable to have final jets with an high transverse momentum , because there is more distinction among signal and minimium bias events .",
    "we find that the limit on @xmath27 can be extended up to @xmath31 , without entailing reductions on significance values greater than @xmath32 and leading , instead , to increases up to @xmath33 on @xmath30 ratios .",

    "is included , due to the constraint on the muons invariant mass .",

    "then , the relevant parameters for our phenomenological study are : the dilaton mass , @xmath80 , the ratio @xmath81 between the electroweak scale , @xmath64 , and the scale of the conformal spontaneous breaking , @xmath62 , the shifts in the dilaton yukawa couplings to fermions , @xmath79 , the dilaton loop induced couplings to massless gauge bosons , @xmath82 , for the photons , and @xmath83 , for the gluons .",
    "these couplings depend sensitively on assumptions about ultraviolet physics , less sensitive to @xmath83 variations . ] .",
    "+ because of the presence of the shifts @xmath79 , the ratio between the partial width for the dilaton decaying to fermions and the analogous width for the higgs in the sm depends on a factor @xmath84 so , depending on @xmath79 values , there can be significant increases in the partial widths for the decays to light fermions . instead ,",
    "because of the presence of the scale @xmath62 , cross sections for the dilaton production , in all channels , are suppressed by a factor @xmath85 with respect to the cross sections for the higgs production .",
    "therefore , signal cross sections are affected by a suppression to the vbf , given by a factor @xmath85 .",
    "however , this suppression can be compensated by the possible increase of the br for the light dilaton decaying to muons . in the following",
    "we take into account two different possibilities , corresponding to the presence of shifts only in the dilaton yukawa coupling to muons and of analogous shifts for all the dilaton yukawa couplings to leptons .",
    "we now take into account the possible presence of shifts in the dilaton yukawa couplings to muons , @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) , and we find , for different gluons - dilaton couplings @xmath83 , the values of the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath88 necessary to obtain a @xmath9 significance for the process @xmath89 , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath0 at the lhc .",
    "+ we consider a @xmath83 parameter variation that goes from a minimum value of @xmath90 , which corresponds to the case of a sm - like coupling , to a value @xmath91 , which corresponds to the case of a qcd completely embedded in the conformal sector .",
    "we neglect , instead , the possible @xmath82 variation from its sm value , which has a negligible influence on the br for the dilaton decaying to muons .",
    "we make use of the @xmath15 values , found in [ k_factor ] .",
    "we can relate these values to the conformal model parameters , considering that the variation of the signal cross section from the higgs signal in the sm can be expressed by the ratio : @xmath92 where @xmath93(@xmath94 ) is the cross section for the dilaton ( higgs ) production and @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) is the br for the dilaton ( higgs ) decaying to muons .",
    "the ratio @xmath97 depends on the conformal model parameters ; for example , in the case of a shift only for the muons and @xmath98 , the @xmath99 ratio becomes @xmath100 we indicate as @xmath101 the values of the @xmath88 parameters that give a @xmath9 significance , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath0 at the lhc . + in tab .",

    "we find a quite soft dependence of the @xmath101 values on dilaton mass values , within the range @xmath102 $ ] ; instead , there is a strong dependence on @xmath81 parameter .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ y_vf_cg ] , referred to a dilaton with @xmath103 , the @xmath101 values , for different dilaton - gluons couplings @xmath83 , as a function of the @xmath81 parameter . for the different @xmath83 values ,",
    "the regions above the lower curves of the plot represent the discovery regions ( significance values higher than @xmath9 ) for the process @xmath89 , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath0 at the lhc .",
    "[ y_vf_cg ] shows that greater @xmath88 shifts are needed for the @xmath9 observation , when smaller @xmath81 and greater @xmath83 values are taken into account .",
    "this trend reflects the fact that signal cross sections are disadvantaged by @xmath81 reductions , because the dilaton production is suppressed by a factor @xmath85 compared to the higgs production , and by @xmath83 increases , because @xmath95 decreases when the width for the dilaton decaying to gluons increases .",
    "the upper curves of the plot denote the exclusion regions for the model parameters .",
    "these regions can be obtained considering the tevatron lepton pairs data @xcite .",
    "indeed , the not discovery at the tevatron for the process @xmath11 fix an upper limit on the process cross section from which we derive upper limits on the conformal model parameters . on the basis of the results shown in fig .",
    "[ y_vf_cg ] , it is predictable that , in the case of a qcd completely embedded in the conformal sector ( @xmath104 ) , the lhc can extend the exclusion zone down to the underside curve related to a @xmath9 significance , or it can discover a signal in correspondence of the possible discovery region .",
    "then , in the cases of smaller @xmath83 values , the possible discovery region expands and it becomes quite wide when the dilaton coupling to gluons is like the sm one ( @xmath98 ) .    finally , we have considered the possibility of analogous shifts for all the dilaton yukawa couplings to leptons , that is @xmath105 and @xmath106 . even when we consider , in this less advantageous assumption , the most unfavorable case that corresponds to a maximum @xmath83 value , @xmath91 , we can obtain at the lhc , like fig .",

    "in this paper , we have shown that the decay to muons of a light cp even scalar produced via vbf can be an interesting channel of study at the lhc . considering new physics models ,",
    "we have shown that , in the higgs mass range , @xmath107 , signal cross section increases of about one order of magnitude are sufficient to obtain a @xmath9 significance , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath0 at the lhc .",

    "our study could be extended considering the other relevant production channels , gluon fusion and the production associated with @xmath2 pairs .",
