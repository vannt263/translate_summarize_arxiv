    "a striking feature of sn  2006jc is the early dust formation ( @xmath4 d ) indicated by the infrared emission of hot ( @xmath5 k ) dust after about day 50 ( di carlo et al .",
    "2008 ; smith et al . 2008 ; mattila et al . 2008 ) and blue shift of emission lines ( smith et al . 2008 ; mattila et al .",
    "although dust might form in the unshocked ejecta as shown by nozawa et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the dust formation in the shocked cool dense shell ( cds ) seems to be preferred ( mattila et al .",
    "in fact , dust condensation in the cds has been invoked already for type iil supernova 1998s ( pozzo et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "a general wisdom is that the light of sn 2006jc is powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath6ni similar to normal sne  ibc ( tominaga et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the x - ray emission is explained by tominaga et al .",
    "( 2008 ) as a result of interaction of sn  ibc ejecta with smoothly distributed rarefied csm with the total mass of @xmath7 . in this model both reverse and forward shocks are adiabatic , i.e. , the dust formation in the shocked gas is precluded . in scenario proposed by mattila et al .",
    "( 2008 ) sn  2006jc ejecta collide with a massive @xmath8 cs shell at the distance of @xmath9 cm . the massive cds formed in the forward shock was presumably the site where the dust condensed after day 50 ( mattila et al .",
    "unfortunately authors did not discuss a possible contribution of cs interaction in the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the present study is motivated by the unsettled issue of the dust - forming site and striking facts presently escaped the detailed analysis , viz . , ( a ) luminous maximum and fast pre - maximum flux rise of sn  1999cq ; ( b ) smooth early continuum of sn  2000er ; and ( c ) odd blue continuum of sn  2006jc .",
    "the goal of the paper is to propose a model that could account for the above properties and some other observational data , including the dust formation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "arguments in favour of a strong cs interaction in sne  ibn at the early stage are considered in section [ sec - general ] .",
    "the interaction models with and without @xmath6ni are then applied to account for the bolometric light curve , x - ray emission , and moderate expansion velocity of outer layers ( section [ sec - interact ] ) .",
    "the parameters of the cds recovered in these models are used to study the dust formation in terms of the theory of homogeneous nucleation ( section [ sec - dust ] ) .",

    "hereafter we adopt for sn  2006jc the explosion date 2006 sep .",

    "pastorello et al . ( 2008 ) emphasise the remarkable homogeneity in the spectral properties among sne  ibn .",
    "this fact provides us a confidence that the conclusions made from the analysis of particular objects can be applied to other members of the family .",
    "here i consider observational data which suggest a dominant contribution of cs interaction in the early luminosity and spectra of sne  ibn .",
    "unusually high luminosity of sn  1999cq ( type ibn ) at the light maximum with the absolute magnitude @xmath11 mag ( matheson et al .",
    "2000 ; pastorello et al .",
    "2008 ) and the fast pre - maximum flux rise by @xmath12 mag in four days ( matheson et al .",
    "2000 ) are unprecedented for sne  ibc including luminous sn  1998bw .",
    "both high luminosity and fast brightening suggest that early sn  1999cq was powered by the ejecta interaction with a dense csm , a scenario similar to that proposed for the early light curve of type iil sn  1998s ( chugai 2001 ) .",
    "sn  2006jc was detected on day 17 after the adopted explosion date ( nakano et al .",
    "2006 ; pastorello et al . 2008 ) and its absolute magnitude at the discovery was similar to that of sn  1999cq at the same age .",
    "it seems plausible , therefore , that the prediscovery light curve of sn  2006jc was similar and the early luminosity of sn  2006jc was also affected by the cs interaction .",
    "the early interaction should lead to the deceleration of outer layers of ejecta which is supported by the fact that the early ( @xmath13 d ) hei 5876   emission of sn  2000er shows the maximal expansion velocity of only @xmath14 km s@xmath1 ( pastorello et al .",
    "2008 ) , rather moderate value for early sn  ibc .    the total energy radiated by sn  1999cq during the first 10 days after the light maximum is about @xmath15 erg according to the available light curve ( matheson et al . 2000 ; pastorello et al .",
    "to produce that energy a shock wave with velocity of @xmath16 km s@xmath1 had to interact with the cs mass of about @xmath17 assuming 100% radiation efficiency .",

    "is overplotted on the observed spectrum ( fooley et al . 2008 ) .",
    ", width=302 ]      the earliest spectrum of sn 2000er shows a smooth continuum ( pastorello et al .",
    "2008 ) , very unlike bumpy continua of any early sn  ibc .",
    "i suggest that the smooth continuum forms in a thin cds likewise in early sn  1998s ( chugai 2001 ) .",
    "the smooth continuum of sn 2000er grows bumpy on the time scale of five days after the first spectrum ( pastorello et al . 2008 ) , which means that the continuum forms in a partially transparent regime , i.e. , the optical depth is @xmath23 . for the luminosity of @xmath24 erg s@xmath1 on day 10 ( pastorello et al .",
    "2008 ) and photospheric radius @xmath18 cm the effective temperature of the continuum turns out to be @xmath25 k.    a question arises , whether a helium - rich cds with a mass of @xmath22 is able to maintain a smooth continuum at the age of @xmath26 days ? to illustrate the possibility i consider the radiation transfer in the isothermal helium slab with thomson scattering and absorption taken into account . to facilitate estimates",
    "i adopt the lte approximation . with the boundary condition @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the radiation density )",
    "is then @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the extinction optical depth and @xmath32 is the thermalization parameter , i.e. , absorption to extinction ratio ; both @xmath31 and @xmath32 are functions of frequency .",
    "this expression permits us to calculate luminosity of the cds for a certain gas temperature using kramers - unzold approximation for the absorption coefficient of the helium - rich matter .",
    "the density in the cds is found from the pressure equilibrium adopting the wind density parameter @xmath33 g cm@xmath1 , shell velocity of @xmath16 km s@xmath1 , and the radius of @xmath34 cm . to produce the continuum luminosity of @xmath24 erg",
    "s@xmath1 the equation ( [ eq - slab ] ) requires the gas of @xmath35 k for the cds mass of @xmath36 . in the range",
    "  the model spectrum is close to black - body with the temperature @xmath38 k. although the extinction optical depth of the shell at 6000    is only @xmath39 the equilibration is rather efficient because thermalization parameter is large @xmath40 in the range @xmath41   .",
    "we thus conclude that the smooth continuum may arise in early sn  ibn .",
    "the epoch of the early smooth continuum of sn  2006jc preceeded the discovery and therefore was missing .",
    "the smooth continuum of sn 2000er grew bumpy on a time scale of about one week ( pastorello et al .",
    "2008 ) , although the short period of sn  2000er observations does not permit one to follow the early evolution from smooth till fully developed bumpy continuum we see in sn  2006jc on day 22 . no doubt ,",
    "the bumpy continuum is composed by numerous lines , presumably of feii as suggested by foley et al .",
    "however , unlike any normal sn  ibc , including sn  1998bw , the spectum of sn  2006jc is unusually blue : the colour @xmath43 ( foley et al .",
    "2007 ) compared with 0.48 of sn  1998bw at the light maximum ( galama et al .",
    "the spectrum also does not show broad absorption lines characteristic of sn  ibc .",
    "this indicates that the configuration of `` photospere '' surrounded by an extended free expansion atmosphere is irrelevant in this case .",
    "following the picture invoked for the early smooth continuum i assume that the bumpy blue continuum of sn  2006jc arises from the same cds but this time with the dominant emission in metal lines .",
    "this picture is similar to sn  2002ic ( chugai et al .",
    "2004a ) , so to demonstrate the possibility i use the same model and the same line list of @xmath44 lines of iron - peak elements in the range of 3500 - 10000  .",
    "the calculated continuum and observed sn  2006jc spectrum on day 22 ( foley at al .",
    "2007 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - synt ] .",
    "the model suggests the emission of randomly oriented plane sheets distributed in the shell @xmath45 .",
    "the total mass of cold fragments is @xmath36 and the solar mass fractions of iron peak elements ( ti , v , cr , fe , ni ) are assumed .",
    "the adopted expansion velocity is @xmath46 km s@xmath1 , ionization temperature 7000 k , excitation temeperature 8000 k , and the area ratio @xmath47 .",
    "just to recall , the area ratio is the ratio of cumulative surface area of fragments to the surface area of the cds ; this parameter characterizes a mixing degree .",
    "the model spectrum is sensitive to the variation of the excitation temeperature within 10% and in lesser extent to to the shell mass and thickness , which may vary within 30% without pronounced change of the spectrum .",
    "the adopted value of the shell thickness @xmath48 corresponds approximately to the width of mixing layer formed as a result of a rayleigh - taylor instability of the thin shell ( chevalier & blondin 1995 ) .",
    "the model qualitatively reproduces the observed spectrum and bolometric luminosity @xmath49 erg s@xmath1 ( cf .",
    "mattila et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the high relative intensity of the blue continuum is the result of a larger number of lines per unit wavelength interval in the blue compared to the red part of the spectrum and a weak saturation of intensity in the blue for a moderate area ratio .",
    "given satisfactory fit and sensible values of model parameters , the proposed picture for the blue continuum provides us indirect support for the conjecture of the strong early cs interaction in sne  ibn .",
    "spectra of sn  2006jc ( foley at al . 2007 ;",
    "pastorello et al .",
    "2007 ) suggest that the velocity of hei line - emitting gas lies in the range of @xmath50 km s@xmath1 with the velocity of the bulk of emitting material in the range of @xmath51 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the minimal velocity of @xmath52 km s@xmath1 could be associated with the cloud shocks speed and perhaps with the velocity of the undisturbed csm .",
    "the latter is about @xmath53 km s@xmath1 as indicated by the absorption minimum of narrow lines of oi 7773   and hei 6678   ( anupama et al .",
    "interestingly , the expansion velocity of csm of sn  2000er indicated by narrow hei absorption components in early spectra is 800 - 900 km s@xmath1 ( pastorello et al .",
    "2008 ) , close to this value .    to account for the velocity spectrum of the hei line - emitting gas",
    "i suggest that the bulk of the hei emission originates from shocked cs clouds .",
    "two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of interstellar cloud engulfed by the blast wave ( klein et al .",
    "1994 ) prompt us a picture in which the velocities of the line - emitting gas are produced by slow ( because of density contrast ) radiative shocks of cs clouds in combination with the fragmentation cascade of shocked clouds and acceleration of fragments .",
    "this scenario is similar to that proposed for the h@xmath2 emission in sn  2002ic ( chugai et al . 2004a ) .",
    "the total optical luminosity of hei lines is about @xmath54 erg s@xmath1 on day 22 ( smith et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the corresponding radiation efficiency of the forward shock kinetic luminosity is @xmath55 . with the forward shock velocity @xmath56 km s@xmath1 , wind density parameter @xmath33 g cm@xmath1 the required efficiency should be @xmath57 , a reasonable value .",
    "the other emission lines seem to originate from the same line - emitting gas .",
    "this is demonstarted by the synthetic spectrum of sn  2006jc on day 22 in which profiles and intensities were adjusted to fit the observed spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ f - mg ] ) .",
    "apart from hei , oi , and caii lines the synthetic spectrum includes mgii lines ( pastorello et al . 2007 ; anupama et al .",
    "2008 ) and two ci lines 9088    ( @xmath58p@xmath59@xmath58p ) and 9406    ( @xmath60p@xmath59@xmath60d ) , which are also pronounced in novae ( williams et al .",
    "there is a vague hint of a week ni 7452   emission with the intensity ratio ni 7452  / oi 7773   of @xmath61 ( fig .",
    "[ f - mg ] ) .",
    "the fact that profiles of all the lines are identical confirms that these emissions originate from the same line - emitting gas , which i associate with the shocked cs clouds .",
    "the cs interaction and bolometric light curve are simulated using the model described earlier ( chugai 2001 ) . to recap ,",
    "the hydrodynamics of the interaction is treated in the thin shell approximation ( chevalier 1982a ) .",
    "the x - ray emissions of the reverse and forward shocks are calculated assuming a homogeneity of each post - shock layer and adopting the cooling function of sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) .",
    "the electron temperature in the postshock gas is calculated taking into account partial coulomb equilibration .",
    "the absorbed and emergent x - ray luminosity is computed assuming the unabsorbed emissivity spectrum to be @xmath62 and taking into acount the absorption by the cool gas ( sn ejecta , cds and unshocked csm ) .",
    "the model despite many simplifying assumptions seems to be reasonable which is confirmed by the modelling of sn  1999em x - ray flux ( chugai et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the absorbed x - ray luminosity is reprocessed into the ultraviolet ( uv ) , optical , and infrared photons .",
    "we adopt that the bulk of this radiation falls in the band in which the observed bolometric light curve is sampled .",
    "this assumption is sensible at the early epoch ( @xmath63 month ) , when the cool gas is opaque in uv region and rather crude at the late epoch ( @xmath64 yr ) , when significant fraction of the reprocessed radiation can escape in uv lines ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) .",
    "the interaction luminosity combined with the diffusion luminosity of the ejecta produces the model bolometric luminosity . in turn , the diffusion luminosity is modelled using the arnett ( 1980 ) approximation .",
    "a smooth csm is assumed , neglecting clumpiness , which implies that the calculated luminosity and temperature of the x - ray emission from the forward shock perhaps are not reliable .",
    "i present two versions of the interaction model : with @xmath6ni and without @xmath6ni .",
    "the gamma - ray deposition is calculated assuming that @xmath6ni is mixed in the inner 90% of the ejecta mass .",
    "the ejecta density distribution is approximated by the exponential law @xmath65 , while the radial density distribution of the csm is adjusted to describe the bolometric and x - ray luminosities and the radii of the dusty shell associated with the cds .",
    "the composition of major elements is assumed to be he : c : o = 0.9 : 0.06 : 0.04 .",
    "this choice , called a `` standard abundance '' , is similar to that of mattila et al .",
    "the pre - sn radius @xmath66 is assumed ; the exact value is irrelevant , unless the radius is very large , @xmath67 .",
    "the table 1 shows model parameters : the explosion energy , ejecta mass , @xmath6ni mass , mass of the cs envelope , mass of the cds formed in the reverse shock by day 50 , and the wind density parameter @xmath68 in the inner region @xmath69 cm .",
    "our models admit formation of the cds with a mass of @xmath70 in the forward shock during initial phase of 5 - 15 days depending on the model . in a more realistic case of clumpy csm",
    "the situation with the forward shock cds would become more complicated .",
    "radiative cloud shocks would result in the formation of cool cs gas in a forward shock .",
    "however , the expected kinematics and distribution of this cool gas would be essentially different compared to the model of a smooth wind",
    ". models with @xmath6ni differ by the ejecta parameters and the wind density .",
    "it should be stressed that ejecta mass and energy are poorly constrained by the light curve and spectrum .",
    "the high energy model a2 corresponds to the preferred model of tominaga et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , while the models a1 and a3 have moderate explosion energy .",
    "the csm density distributions for all the models are presented in fig .",
    "[ f - den ] .",
    "all the models satisfactorily reproduce the observed bolometric light curve ( fig .",
    "[ f - dyn]a ) including the maximal luminosity of sn  1999cq estimated from @xmath71 magnitude ( pastorello et al . 2008 ) .",
    "note , we do not plot the low - mass model a3 since its behavior repeats that of the model a1 in all the panels of fig .",
    "[ f - dyn ] .",
    "models with @xmath6ni ( a1 and a3 ) reproduce the x - ray flux within @xmath72 errors ( fig .",
    "[ f - dyn]b ) , while the model a2 with the high energy lies beyond @xmath72 range .",
    "the model b predicts too high x - ray luminosity that exceeds by a factor of @xmath73 the observed x - ray luminosity around day 50 .",
    "this is a serious problem for the model without @xmath6ni .",
    "yet one can not rule out that the clumpiness of csm , ignored here , might modify the interaction zone in such a way that x - rays were efficiently absorbed .",
    "the observed x - ray flux seem to show a drop by a factor 2.5 between the maximum on day @xmath74 and the epoch of @xmath75 d ( immler et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this drop can not be reproduced in any of our interaction model , although models a1 and a3 are consistent with observations within @xmath72 errors .",
    "if the drop is real then shocks in cs clouds engulfed by the forward shock layer contribute significantly to the x - ray emission . in this case",
    "the drop of x - ray flux could be related with the disappearence of cs clouds beyond the radius @xmath76 cm .    a massive ( @xmath77 ) cds forms by day 50 in all the models ( table 1 ) ; the expansion velocity at the age of 50 - 100 days is @xmath25 km s@xmath1 in models a1 , a3 and b and @xmath78 km s@xmath1 in the high - energy model a2 ( fig .",
    "[ f - dyn]c ) .",
    "accordingly , for models a1 , a3 and b the cds radii are close to photometric radii of the dusty shell ( fig .",
    "[ f - dyn]d ) reported by mattila et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , while the high - energy model a2 has essentially larger cds radius .",
    "interestingly , for the considered models the cds mass at @xmath79 d falls in the range @xmath80 , the value used in section 2 to analyse the smooth continuum of sn  2000er .",
    "i explored also the model in which the csm with the mass of @xmath81 has a structure of a dense thin shell with the radius of @xmath82 cm .",
    "this choice corresponds to a scenario in which the cs shell was violently ejected with the velocity of @xmath83 km s@xmath1 during the outburst two years prior to the sn explosion . in this case",
    "the bolometric light curve is notably affected by the cs interaction and the model light curve with or without @xmath6ni is inconsistent with observations .    to summarize ,",
    "the bolometric light curve of sn  2006jc can be explained by models with and without @xmath6ni ; both cases suggest the dense wind at the distance @xmath84 cm . in all the models",
    "massive cds forms which might become the dust formation site .",
    ".parameters of models of sn ejecta and csm [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t - prof ]",
    "the proposed scenario of sn  ibn with the strong early cs interaction turns out successful in explaining some unusual observational properties of sne  ibn .",
    "however , until now we ignored some questions that might have interesting consequences for our model .",
    "it is worthy , therefore , to pose and briefly discuss challenging issues and , if possible , to impose additional constraints for the model .",
    "the proposed interpretation of the blue bumpy continuum suggests that the most emergent optical radiation originates from the cds . in case , when the interaction luminosity dominates , the energy from the reverse and forward shocks is deposited into the cds in a usual way via absorption of x - rays and , perhaps , the thermal conductivity in the mixing zone of the forward shock",
    ".    another possibility could be that the dominant source is @xmath6ni decay . in this case",
    "the energy is deposited into cds owing to the compton scattering of gamma - quanta and the absorption of ultraviolet radiation emitted by the unshocked ejecta in turn powered by the radioactive decay .",
    "the efficiency of the gamma - ray deposition to the cds is of the order of the ratio of the cds mass to the mass of ejecta , which is small unless ejecta mass is low @xmath85 .",
    "alternatively , the cds gas could be ionized and excited by the absorption of the ultraviolet radiation from the unshocked ejecta .",
    "the problem with this mechanism is that in the unshocked freely expanding sn  ibc envelope the ultraviolet radiation is strongly reprocessed by the photon scattering and splitting in numerous ultraviolet metal lines , so the emergent ultraviolet flux gets strongly suppressed relative to visual .",
    "the situation in this respect is similar to sne  ia ( cf . pinto $ eastman 2000 ) . at first glance",
    "the ultraviolet flux might become stronger , if the ejecta mass is low .",
    "however , for this to be the case the mass should be much lower than that of sne  ia , i.e. , @xmath86 . we thus conclude that in the radioactive model the cds can be the source of the blue continuum , if the ejecta mass is low , @xmath85 .      helium lines ( e.g. 3889  ) in the blue part of sn  2006jc spectrum show p cygni profiles with the absorption minimum at @xmath87 km s@xmath1 and a comparable equivalent width of absorption and emission components ( foley at al . 2007 ) . a natural explanation of this phenomenon is that the continuum in blue region is strong , so the scattering component dominate or comparable with the net line emission .",
    "in fact absorption components are also seen in oi 7773   and in hei 6678   lines ( anupama et al .",
    "the maximal velocity observed in the blue absorption wing of hei 3889    line is @xmath88 km s@xmath1 , three times larger than the wind velocity , @xmath89 km s@xmath1 .",
    "apart from the wind , therefore , an absorbing high velocity component ( @xmath90 km s@xmath1 ) is needed to account for the line absorption .",
    "three possibilities are conceivable for the line - absorbing gas in the range of 600 - 2000 km s@xmath1 : ( a ) the csm in fact has the free expansion kinematics @xmath91 with the most material in the range of 600 - 2000 km s@xmath1 ; ( b ) the line - absorbing gas is simply the same line - emitting gas in the forward shock ; ( c ) the csm is flow with the constant velocity of @xmath92 km s@xmath1 but in the preshock zone the cs gas is accelerated up to 1900 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the first option predicts that the emission lines related with the csm should get broader with time .",
    "in fact , the absorption of hei 3889   does not show this trend according to spectra taken by foley et al .",
    "the second option suggests that fragments of cs clouds in the forward shock should have large covering factor @xmath93 , which is unlikely , although is not rulled out .",
    "the third possibility is similar to that suggested for the h@xmath2 high velocity cs absorption component in early sn  1998s ( chugai et al .",
    "2001 ) , where this feature was attributed to the preshock gas accelerated by either radiation or cosmic rays generated in the forward shock . at the distance of @xmath94 cm the radiative force in case of sn  2006jc is weak and can not accelerate the preshock gas up to more than 100 km s@xmath1 in the wind frame and this mechanism should be rejected .    as to cosmic rays ,",
    "the situation is more optimistic .",
    "the point is that in case of clumpy csm the cosmic ray pressure is build up by the overall shock kinetic luminosity , while the acceleration is applied primarily only to the intercloud gas with a small mass fraction of the inflowing csm .",
    "the intercloud gas , therefore , can acquire significant velocity in the preshock zone .",
    "let @xmath95 is the density of the intercloud gas that is substantially lower than the average cs density @xmath96 . momentum and mass conservation result in the maximal preshock velocity of the intercloud gas @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the forward shock speed , @xmath99 is the ratio of the energy density of cosmic rays to the density of the shock kinetic energy @xmath100 . for @xmath56",
    "km s@xmath1 and @xmath101 one needs @xmath102 to produce the preshock velocity of @xmath103 km s@xmath1 in the wind frame .",
    "this estimate demonstrates that velocities of absorbing gas up to 1900 km @xmath1 might be explained , if the line - absorbing gas is associated with the intercloud gas accelerated in the cosmic ray precursor .      between days 22 and 60 intensities of mgii 7889   and oi 7773    lines in sn  2006jc are comparable ( cf .",

    "is that the abundances of oxygen and magnesium are comparable .",
    "this indicates that we perhaps see the matter in which oxygen is strongly depleted by cno burning .",
    "indeed , massive stars at the boundary between helium core and hydrogen envelope have a zone , in which oxygen is depleted owing to cno burning by a factor of 10 - 20 ( cf .",

    "the low abundance of hydrogen in the csm around sn  2006jc is consistent with the conjecture that we might see the matter with strongly depleted oxygen .",
    "an alternative explanation is that mg / o ratio is cosmic , and intensities of mgii and oi lines are comparable because these lines are thermalized , i.e. , level populations are close to boltzmann distribution and lines are optically thick .",
    "the thermalization in a certain line occurs if @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the average number of conservative scattering in the line before the photon escape , @xmath106 is the thermalization parameter , and @xmath107 is the collisional de - excitation rate . using estimates based on the csm density , pressure equilibrium , hei line intensity , and boltzmann excitation of the lower level",
    "i estimate @xmath108 for the mgii 7889   line on day 22 .",
    "this confirms the possibility of the thermalization of mgii and oi emission lines .",
    "what explanation of the comparable intensities of mgii and oi lines  similar abundances of oxygen and magnesium or thermalization  is correct remains an open question .",
    "the conjecture of the similar abundances of mg and o seems to contradict to the fact that the narrow absorption is absent in mgii 7889  , while it is present in oi 7773    ( cf .",

    "our modelling of light curve and other properties of sn  2006jc does not permit us to constrain the ejecta mass and explosion energy , although models with the moderate energy @xmath109 erg are preferred , if one admits that the dust forms in the cds with the velocity of @xmath25 km s@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , models of sn  2006jc with and without @xmath6ni are plausible , although both have its own drawbacks .",
    "the model of a standard sn  ibc powered by @xmath6ni decay faces problems if we identify the blue continuum with the emission of the cds .",
    "only the low mass ejecta @xmath85 could reconcile the radioactive model with the proposed scenario of the blue continuum . on the other hand",
    "the drawback of the model without @xmath6ni is that it predicts unacceptably strong x - ray luminosity .",
    "a more certain judgement on the source of sne  ibn luminosity at the nebular epoch could be made in principle on the basis of the late time ( @xmath110 d ) photometry and spectra of sn  ibn .",
    "a deviation of the bolometric light curve from that predicted by the radioactive model would favour the cs interaction as a primary energy source . on the other hand uniformity of light curves and their correspondance to",
    "that expected for the radioactive model would favour the radioactivity .",
    "if the radioactivity as a primary energy source will be confirmed the second crucial question would remain , whether the ejecta is a standard sn  ibc or the object similar to our low mass model a3 with @xmath111 ejecta and @xmath6ni mass of @xmath112 .",
    "this issue could be elucidated by the late time spectra that may or may not reveal strong [ oi ] 6300 , 6364   emission , the canonical feature of sn  ibc , at the nebular stage .",
    "the strength of this emission relative to feii line continuum would confirm or reject a picture of explosion of a standard sn  ibc slighly spoiled by cs intraction .",
    "the dust absorption could hamper this test , although it may well be that due to clumpiness of the dusty shell the attenuation will not be large at the late nebular epoch .",
    "the csm mass around sn  2006jc at the distance @xmath84 cm in our models ( table 1 ) is in the range of @xmath113 . with the outflow velocity @xmath114",
    "km s@xmath1 this mass had to be lost by pre - sn during the last year before the explosion with the rate of @xmath115 yr@xmath1 and kinetic luminosity of @xmath116 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the outflow characteristics suggest extraordinary behavior of pre - sn . the pre - sn mass loss might be related with the bright outburst two years before the sn  2006jc explosion ( nakano et al .",
    "2006 ; foley et al . 2007 ;",
    "pastorello et al .",
    "however , if the ejection episode was as brief as the optical outburst then the cs shell should be narrow and reside at the distance of about @xmath82 cm in contrast to our model which suggests a significant fraction of csm in the close vicinity , at @xmath69 cm . assuming the cs shell expansion velocity of 2400 km s@xmath1 one gets the cs shell even farther out , at the distance of @xmath117 cm ( mattila et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "a problem of a vigorous mass loss that preceeds the sn explosion is familiar in relation with sne  iin .",
    "following the conjecture invoked for sn  1994w ( chugai et al .",
    "2004b ) one might suggest that in some cases , including sne  ibn , the mass ejection by pre - sn is initiated by the flash of nuclear burning , e.g. , of neon .",
    "however , the current theory of stellar evolution does not predict the violent mass loss of pre - sne with initial masses @xmath118 ( heger et al .",
    ". only models of massive stars in the range of @xmath119 reveal the instability that could result in the strong nuclear outbursts and mass ejection ( heger et al .",
    "the physics is in pair production , which leads to infall , explosion of carbon and oxygen followed by mass ejection .",
    "these stars can experience several ejection episodes before the ultimate collapse and collisions between consecutively ejected shells could produce optical outburst resemblant supernovae events ( heger et al .",
    "recently , extremely luminous sn  2006gy was identified with a similar phenomenon ( woosley et al .",
    "it is not clear , whether such a scenario is applicable to sne  ibn .",
    "if does , then these supernovae should be attributed to the cs interaction in the absence of @xmath6ni .",
    "an important implication of this scenario is that the luminous massive helium star should remain at the position of sn  ibn .",
    "an alternative scenario , in which sn explosion might be preceeded by the vigorous mass loss , is a binary system in which a black hole experiences a merging with the helium core of a red supergiant . the supernova explosion in this case is presumably driven by the non - relativistic jets generated by the rapid disk accretion of the helium core material onto the black hole .",
    "in fact this possibility is a version of a merger scenario of gamma - ray bursts ( fryer & woosley 1998 ; fryer et al .",
    "the merging of a neutron star with a red supergiant leads to the similar scenario because the inspiraling neutron star that accrete at the bondi - hoyle accretion rate grows black hole already in the hydrogen envelope ( chevalier 1993 ; fryer et al .",
    "the binary scenario predicts asphericity of ejecta caused by jets and of the csm caused by the equatorial outflow from the common envelope .",
    "the goal of this study was to present a model that might account for the unusual properties of sneibn including sn  2006jc .",
    "i argue that the cs interaction with a dense csm is essential energy source for the early light curve of sn  ibn .",
    "i demonstrated that the cs interaction at the early stage leads to the formation of the cds which in turn is responsible for the smooth continuum of early sn  2000er and unusual blue bumpy continuum of sn  2006jc .",
    "i showed that the dust can form in the cds at about day 50 in accord with observations .",
    "the modelling of the hei line profile affected by the dust absorption confirms a picture in which the line - emitting gas is associated with the cs clouds shocked and fragmented in the forward shock , while the dust is related with the fragmented cds .",
    "it should be stressed that scenario in which sn  ibn supernova is the explosion of a standard or luminous sn  ibc sligtly modified by the cs interaction remains unconfirmed and photometry and sectroscopy of sne  ibn at the late nebular stage are needed to clarify the issue .",
