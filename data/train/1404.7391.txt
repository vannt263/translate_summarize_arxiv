    "monitoring a quantum system  i.e. observing it repeatedly and frequently  induces stochastic evolutions , or _ _ quantum trajectories__@xcite , where the uncertainty of the outcomes is the source of the randomness .",
    "quantum jumps@xcite , which consist in the sharp transitions of a system from one quantum state to another , are fundamental illustrations of this behaviour .",
    "they have been observed for the first time in fluorescent systems@xcite and nowadays in almost everyday meso- or nano - scale experiments@xcite .",
    "they emerge naturally as a consequence of the interplay between system evolution and continuous measurement and are very abrupt yet not strictly instantaneous . aside from their use in quantum monte",
    "carlo methods@xcite , quantum trajectories are instrumental to control small quantum systems@xcite .",
    "feedback control consists in using the measurement record to act on the system in order to constrain or control its evolution .",
    "the action on the system can be carried out through a hamiltonian drive ",
    "the most common and historical method@xcite  yet it was underlined recently@xcite that measurements themselves could be used as they inevitably have a back - action on the system . a minimal version of this second method deals with adjusting the measurement intensity ( or rate ) but not the measured observables .",
    "quantum zeno dynamics@xcite , in which the dynamics of the system is frozen in a subspace selected through strong measurement , is an archetypal example .",
    "however control by measurement is multi - faceted because the latter picture is true only for a system evolving unitarily and breaks down for a system evolving dissipatively .",
    "indeed , hamiltonian and thermally - activated quantum jumps behave very differently with respect to a varying measurement intensity . in the first case",
    ", the zeno effect makes the average time between two jumps increase with the measurement strength whereas in the dissipative case it converges to a constant which is intrinsic to the system - reservoir coupling . in this paper",
    "we consider a model system , idealising a double quantum dot in contact with two electron reservoirs , where both a unitary and a dissipative evolution compete.this is the simplest system where the effect we are ultimately interested in can be seen .",
    "the tunnelling rate between dots can be controlled by adjusting the intensity of the particle position measurement without impacting the dot - reservoir jump rates .",
    "available pathways can thus be controlled through measurement , and this is the basic principle making flux control possible . by monitoring the particle position , we may choose to measure strongly when the particle is in the right dot and mildly otherwise .",
    "as a consequence , when the particle is in the right dot , the jump rate to the right reservoir is not modified but its tunnelling rate to the left dot is frozen and the probability to backtrack is thereby reduced .",
    "this creates a non - zero extra average particle flux from the left reservoir to the right , and a macroscopic effect is obtained from what seemed to be a very innocent measurement method .",
    "the physical system we have in mind is that of a double quantum dot ( dqd ) , or rather an abstract idealisation of a dqd with an architecture similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : ideal ] , coupled to two electron reservoirs at given chemical potentials .",
    "we may schematically picture our model system as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ideal ] , in which electrons can either jump to the left / right dots from the left / right reservoirs , back and forth , or tunnel through the potential barrier from one dot to the other .",
    "the position of the electron is continuously monitored with a non - specified measurement apparatus , which in the dqd architecture can be implemented through an auxiliary quantum point contact ( qpc ) as in @xcite .",
    "we further assume that the coulomb repulsion between two electrons in the quantum dots is high enough to be able to neglect double occupancy in our idealised description .",
    "we write @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , the system space vectors where there is no electron in the dqd , one in the left dot , and one in the right dot , respectively .",
    "three processes are at play : tunnelling between the dots ; quantum hopping between dots and reservoirs ; and back - action of the measurement .",
    "they generate the dqd density matrix evolution , called the quantum trajectory : @xmath6 during a time duration @xmath7 .",
    "the tunnelling evolution is unitary , @xmath8 dt$ ] with inter - dots hamiltonian , @xmath9 the dot - bath hopping generated evolution @xmath10 is dissipative , and we model it through a deterministic evolution of the form @xmath11 with @xmath12 a lindblad operator@xcite linear in @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that , in the absence of tunnelling , the left reservoir would thermalise the left dot into a gibbs steady state of chemical potential @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath15 for the right reservoir and right dot ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) the hopping rate from the left dot to the left reservoir ( resp . from the left reservoir to the left dot ) in absence of tunnelling , and by @xmath18 and @xmath19 the respective right dot - reservoir hopping rates ( @xmath20 being the inverse temperature ) . a possible implementation of this prescription",
    "is to write @xmath21 where the associated lindblad generators @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 take the form @xmath26 with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the left / right dot occupancy is monitored continuously via a weak measurement apparatus .",
    "we write @xmath31 the measurement operator ( in the following , we take @xmath32 because only the differences matter ) , the strength of the measurement , i.e. the intensity of the _ look _ , increases with the values of @xmath33 .",
    "the measurement result is a random process , which we denote @xmath34 .",
    "physically , @xmath34 may represent the total charge going through the quantum point contact monitoring the dqd , the state being read from the local average intensity ( the instantaneous intensity being , strictly speaking , singular ) as was done in @xcite .",
    "it is known@xcite that quantum mechanical rules for measurement imply that @xmath34 varies in time according to : @xmath35 . here",
    ", @xmath36 is a standard wiener process , i.e. @xmath37 is the usual white noise in - time process , and its randomness is an echo of the random nature of quantum measurements .",
    "a given realisation of this wiener process corresponds to a given realisation of a time - series of weak measurements .",
    "it is also known@xcite that the back - action of the measurement on the system density matrix reads @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the lindblad generator associated to @xmath40 and where @xmath41 is the stochastic innovation term , @xmath42 .",
    "it is worth noticing that any given realisation of a time - series of weak measurement , i.e. a time - series of observation , corresponds to a realisation of the process @xmath34 , and hence that the process @xmath34 is the only information our model observer possesses on the dqd .    as a further simplification",
    "we take the dqd density matrix @xmath13 to be of the following form , @xmath43.\\ ] ] this choice can actually be made with no lack of generality as a diagonal density matrix is naturally prepared and as the form ( [ eq : rho ] ) is preserved by the evolution ( [ eq : evol ] ) .",
    "this parametrisation of the density matrix simply shows the probabilities @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the dqd to be in the basis states @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , plus a ( real ) phase @xmath47 encoding the delocalisation due to the tunnel coupling between the dots .",
    "we now have everything needed to expand eq .",
    "( [ eq : evol ] ) and get explicit evolution equations for @xmath44 , @xmath46 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , see eq .   .",
    "we have used the compact notation @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . @xmath51",
    ", @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    equation ( [ eq : evol ] ) is a set of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) for the dqd density matrix coefficients .",
    "it is very complicated , there is no hope to solve it exactly , and the description may look a bit complicated at this point .",
    "however it is obvious from fig.[fig : trajectory ] that the behaviour of the system is very peculiar in the large @xmath55 limit . indeed ,",
    "if the measurement strength is strong enough the system has a tendency to collapse most of the time onto one of the three states @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , and do random jumps between them .",
    "these are the quantum jumps , and we can _ approximately _ describe the dqd evolution as a time - series of random jumps between those three states . this limiting description , which is often assumed from the start and which is admittedly much simpler but only valid in an appropriate regime , is actually not trivial to derive from the full description we have provided . proving rigorously that it does so will not be done in this paper , rather we will invoke heuristic arguments and numerical simulations . because @xmath56 , the diagonal coefficients of the density matrix evolve inside a triangle .",
    "when the monitoring is not strong enough , their random trajectory explores the whole bulk but when it is intense , they spend most of their time near the corners . from a physical point of view this is completely expected : indirectly measuring the particle position has a tendency to make the wave packet collapse onto one of the position eigenstates .",
    "we thus have an approximated effective markov chain description of our system in the strong measurement limit ( see fig . [",
    "fig : markov ] ) , in which the dqd system is described by the probabilities @xmath57 for the dqd density matrix to be near one of those triangle vertices , that is , the probabilities for the dqd state to be close to @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the time evolution of these probabilities is fully characterised by the transition rates between the different states . their direct computation from eq .",
    "is technical , and will be done properly in @xcite . as suggested by the numerics ,",
    "let us assume that the @xmath58 transition process is dominated by trajectories close to the @xmath59 boundary of the simplex for which @xmath60 ( and hence @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) .",
    "under these approximations , eq.([eq : expanded ] ) then becomes @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this evolution encodes the competition between the bath coupling and the measurement back - action , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the sharp transitions can be understood by analogy with kramers theory where a particle excited by white noise fluctuations shows a jumpy behaviour because it evolves in a bimodal effective potential .",
    "the jump statistics from @xmath66 to @xmath67 ( or the reversed ) becomes poissonian in the large @xmath68 limit , the transition rates , defined as the mean time between two jumps , were shown to converge to @xmath69 , @xmath70 ( and similarly @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) for @xmath68 large .",
    "similar methods along the lines of @xcite enable one to estimate the transition rates in the @xmath73 region .",
    "however , these arguments assume a decoupling between the different processes which has to be proved @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we will only use the fact ( see @xcite ) that in the strong measurement limit , these transition rates are : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the point to notice is that the rates @xmath79 and @xmath80 , induced by the tunnelling transition @xmath81 , vanish as @xmath82 for strong measurement in accordance with the quantum zeno effect , while the rates @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , activated by the dissipative contacts @xmath87 , are not renormalised neither by the tunnelling nor the measurement and remain finite in the strong measurement limit .",
    "by monitoring the particle position continuously in time we have access to the electron flux",
    ". however the only information our model observer has on the dqd is the measurement output @xmath34 , and thus she / he has to read out the flux from this process . since for strong enough measurement , the particle position is approximately well defined , it is possible to rely on a classically inspired characterisation of the flux .",
    "one can simply define the electron transfer during a time duration @xmath88 as the difference between the number @xmath89 of quantum jumps from state @xmath4 to state @xmath5 and the number @xmath90 of quantum jumps from @xmath5 to @xmath4 during this time period .",
    "this can be read out from the numbers of break points in the time - slope of @xmath34 , see fig.[fig : trajectory ] .",
    "this is a random number whose statistics is induced from that of the dqd density matrix components .",
    "hence , the mean flux that the observer is measuring is the",
    " statistical mean \" of the electron transfer ( and not a quantum average in the usual sense , see below ) . by ergodicity , averaging in time yields the mean , and the  statistically computed \" mean flux is naturally defined as : from the event @xmath91 . ]",
    "@xmath92 we numerically solved the system of sdes ( [ eq : evol ] ) for the dqd quantum trajectory  and not the approximate markov chain  and computed the measured average flux we described in ( [ eq : statj ] ) .",
    "as the equations are strongly non linear , we used an adaptive runge - kutta discretisation method which is described in more details in @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : flux ] ) .",
    "the flux decreases as a function of the measurement strength : strong measurements tend to zeno freeze the tunnelling transition between @xmath4 and @xmath5 thus making it harder for the electrons to go through the dqd .     and @xmath54 * a ) * constant difference of potential @xmath93 and the measurement strength varies .",

    "* b ) * constant measurement strength @xmath94 and the difference of potential varies.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    within the markov chain approximation this mean flux can be easily computed .",
    "standard results from probability theory @xcite allow the flux to be expressed as @xmath95 with @xmath96 ( resp .",
    "@xmath97 ) the markov chain stationary probability to be in @xmath98 ( resp .",
    "@xmath99 ) .",
    "the stationary probabilities can be easily computed from the markov master equation implied by the transitions rates ( see @xcite for more details ) which gives : @xmath100 in the strong measurement limit and with @xmath101 .",
    "this expression is plotted in fig.[fig : flux ] for comparison with the exact numerical result , and clearly confirms the accuracy of our effective description in the strong measurement limit .",
    "how would one compute the electron flux in the standard way without taking into account the measurement records ?",
    "a reasonable electron flux operator in our setting is the following : @xmath102 quantum mechanically , the average flux is then obtained by taking the trace of this operator against the steady dqd density matrix : @xmath103 .",
    "one has to pick the mean dqd density matrix because one is not recording the measurement outputs ( and taking the mean means averaging over all possible dqd quantum trajectories ) . as expected and shown in fig.[fig : flux ] , @xmath104 , but for this to hold one has to include the back - action effect of the continuous monitoring on the dqd density matrix ( even though we did not record the measurement results ) .",
    "this result is admittedly expected , but the way it emerges from completely different descriptions and equations is nevertheless surprising , and as far as we know , this connection has never been made explicitly before .",
    "the statistical definition for the flux has the advantage of being usable also in the case where there is no steady density matrix , for example in the presence of a general feedback scheme .",
    "the peculiarity of the present situation which allows for feedback is that our model observer gets information on the flux continuously in time and realisation by realisation , i.e. not as an ensemble average .",
    "the main idea behind the feedback rests on the fact that the transition rates for the hamiltonian junction or the dissipative coupling do not scale in the same way as the measurement strength increases . by measuring more strongly when the particle is on the right we increase its probability to jump in the right reservoir rather than backtrack to the left dot . if we continuously monitor the particle position we can increase the measurement intensity only when it is on the right thus breaking the symmetry of the system and creating a flux from left to right .    ,",

    "is formally driven dt + d_{\\mathcal{o}}(\\rho_t ) dx_t$ ] where the deterministic part of @xmath110 is collected in @xmath111 . ] by @xmath34 , one could theoretically extract exactly @xmath13 from @xmath34 .",
    "however it is more practical@xcite and more robust to estimate it using the fact that @xmath13 is given by the slope of the measurement records in the strong measurement limit .",
    "indeed , the drift term in the time evolution of @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 , overcomes the noise for strong measurement .",
    "it is equal to @xmath112 when @xmath113 , @xmath114 when @xmath115 and @xmath116 when @xmath117 .",
    "so when the density matrix is concentrated on one of the natural basis states and if @xmath118 and @xmath119 are big enough , i.e. the measurement is strong enough , the dqd density matrix @xmath13 can be approximately read out from the time - slope of the measurement results . besides , this instantaneous slope is ( formally ) infinite because of white noise properties , and it consequently needs to be averaged over a small time window @xmath120 .",
    "we thus write @xmath121 .",
    "further we take a measurement operator that discriminates equally l and r from 0 , i.e , we choose @xmath122 .",
    "we then measure as strongly as we can when the electron is likely to be in the right dot and keep measuring mildly when it is not to keep track of its position .",
    "this can be enforced by taking : @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is an arbitrary threshold that can be optimised numerically and @xmath125 is the indicator function , equal to @xmath126 if the inequality is satisfied and @xmath112 otherwise . a snapshot of a trajectory is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : feedback ] .",
    "the evolution of the system now obeys an even more complicated stochastic differential equation .",
    "however , assuming that the measurement stays strong enough for the markovian approximation to be faithful , we can estimate the maximum flux that would be obtained with a perfect feedback by simply changing the jump rates , i.e. computing @xmath79 , @xmath84 , @xmath83 , @xmath86 with @xmath127 and @xmath80 , @xmath85 with @xmath128 .",

    "this result is valid only for a perfect feedback scheme , that is if the system state is perfectly known at all times . as a result",
    "it is unfortunately just an upper bound for practical feedback schemes .",
    "however , this feedback scheme is robust enough for the existence of an induced current to persist away from the strong measurement regime .    .",
    "the analytic upper bound previously found is shown by a dashed line . here",

    "the analytic expressions in the markovian limit are shown by dashed lines .",
    "the feedback scheme indeed increases the flux in the dqd and is even able to counter a small difference of potential .",
    "( @xmath131 , @xmath54 , @xmath106 , @xmath107),scaledwidth=48.0% ]    using the same numerical method as before , we estimate the electron flux going through the idealised dqd for various feedback strengths , i.e. for various maximum measurement rates .",
    "we compared the numerical flux with the upper bounds we have just found .",
    "the numerical computation were done with complete sdes , including feedback , and not with the markovian approximation .",
    "the results are shown on fig.[fig : feedbackflux ] .",
    "in particular , they clearly show that this feedback procedure is able to generate a flux in the absence of a chemical potential difference .",
    "the disagreement between the upper bound and the practical feedback scheme for strong feedback is a consequence of the finite window of integration of the measurement records : as the jumps get sharper it becomes increasingly difficult to know the system state in time and to switch the measurement strength fast enough .",
    "using a simple feedback scheme , in the sense that it relies on the measurement strength of the apparatus only , we have shown that it is possible to create , control or reverse a particle flux in a quantum system . even if our study has been done in a simple setting , the effect we have discovered is undoubtedly very general . the way we monitor a quantum system",
    "not only modifies its perceived fluctuations or correlations but also changes its non - equilibrium properties in a dramatic way ( changing the sign of a flux in our example ) .",
    "this remains true even if the measurement itself has a completely symmetric back - action on the whole system . in this respect ,",
    "the effect we described bears similarities with the parrondo paradox@xcite or flashing ratchets @xcite because it amounts to the production of an asymmetric output by oscillating between two different yet symmetric situations .",
    "this effect could be used to engineer out - of - equilibrium quantities in systems where the measurement intensity is the only control parameter .",

    "we further take @xmath144 to simplify the equations and make the assumption that the measurement rate is much bigger than the characteristic coupling rate with the baths , i.e. @xmath145 . then @xmath146 .",
    "note that these equations are still redundant as the conservation of probability , i.e. the fact that @xmath56 , yields @xmath147 .",
    "positivity of the dqd density matrix imposes @xmath148 and @xmath149 . the stochastic flow generated by ( [ eq : expanded ] ) takes place on the simplex @xmath148 and @xmath149 with @xmath150 .",

    "different mechanisms are in competition in eq.([eq : expanded ] ) , and the typical behaviour of the dqd quantum trajectories results from this competition .",
    "the hamiltonian flow induces a rotation on @xmath47 and @xmath154 at a frequency of order @xmath155 and the lindladian terms @xmath156 a relaxation the dqd matrix towards the diagonal gibbs density matrix .",
    "the @xmath68-dependent terms describe the random progressive collapses on eigen - vectors of @xmath157 due to the measurement .",
    "they thus force the dqd density matrix to converge to one of the corners of the simplex .",
    "the characteristic time for collapsing is of order @xmath82 , and therefore very small in the limit of interest .",
    "there is thus a separation of time scales , the shortest one being that associated to the measurement collapse , and this is the origin of the jumpy behaviour of the dqd trajectories .",
    "echoes of these competitive mechanisms can be seen in the invariant measure of the process ( [ eq : expanded ] ) . as can be seen in fig.[fig : pdf ] , it is highly concentrated on the corners @xmath158 of the simplex @xmath148 . by ergodicity",
    "this means that a typical trajectory spends a large amount of time close to the corners , and abruptly jumps at random times from one corner to the other .",
    "the time duration of these jumps are of order @xmath82 up to logarithmic corrections .",
    "there are two types of transitions , either between @xmath112 and @xmath99 or @xmath98 , or between @xmath99 and @xmath98 , which are generated by two different mechanisms : the transitions @xmath159 or @xmath59 are generated by the dissipative lindbladian evolution , while the transitions @xmath160 or @xmath161 are hamiltonian generated .",
    "we now give estimations of the transition rates for the transitions from one corner to another which yield to the approximate @xmath162-state markov chain description of the dqd quantum trajectories .",
    "the states of the markov chain are in one - to - one correspondence to the corners of the simplex , so that we safely index them as @xmath112 , @xmath99 or @xmath98 .      here",
    "we give an estimate ( at @xmath68 large ) of the transition rates assuming we can deal with the different transition processes independently .    :",
    "as suggested by the numerics , and in particular by the shape of the invariant measure , let us assume that the @xmath58 transition process is dominated by trajectories close to the @xmath59 boundary of the simplex for which @xmath60 ( and hence @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) .",

    ". this evolution codes for the competition between the bath coupling and the measurement back - action , and it was studied in full details in @xcite .",
    "the sharp transitions emerge from an extension of kramers theory where a particle excited only by white noise fluctuations shows a jumpy behaviour because it evolves in a bimodal effective potential .",
    "the jump statistics from @xmath66 to @xmath67 ( or the reversed ) becomes poissonian in the large @xmath68 limit , the transition rates , defined as the mean time between two jumps , were shown to converge to @xmath69 , @xmath70 ( and similarly @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) for @xmath68 large .",

    ": similarly , we assume that the trajectories involved in this transition are predominantly close to the @xmath161-boundary , i.e. @xmath164 ( and hence @xmath165 ) , so that the evolution is dominated by the competition between the measurement back - action and hamiltonian evolution . with those simplifications in mind ,",
    "the set of equations ( [ eq : expanded ] ) simplifies to : @xmath166 these equations , but in the limit where @xmath167 and for @xmath168 and @xmath18 so that @xmath146 , describe continuous measurement of an observable non - commuting with the hamiltonian evolution of a two level system .",
    "they of course induce quantum jumps between the observable eigen - states , and were studied with mathematical details in @xcite . for large @xmath68 ,",
    "the jump statistics becomes poissonnian and the average time between two jumps gives a transition rate @xmath169 .",
    "notice that this rate goes to 0 when the measurement strength goes to infinity as expected from the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) .",
    "we here describe an alternative decomposition of the dynamics of dqd quantum trajectories in two intrinsically different processes which take places on different time scales : those associated to the behaviour when the dqd trajectory is close to one the corner , and those associated to the jumps from one corner to the other . the later",
    "are dominated by the measurement process ( for @xmath68 large ) , and hence by the collapse of the dqd density matrix .",

    "let us slice the simplex @xmath173 by cutting the @xmath112-corner with a surface at an intermediate scale , defined say by @xmath174 , with @xmath175 ( or equivalently by @xmath176 ) .",

    "for @xmath68 large , the dominating process acting on the dqd trajectory in the neighbourhood of a surface @xmath174 at an intermediate scale is the measurement process .",
    "thus , once the dqd trajectory has reached the surface @xmath174 , it collapses to one of the corners , either back at the @xmath112-corner or towards the @xmath99- or @xmath98-corner , and this collapse takes place on a microscopic time scale of order @xmath82 .",

    "this is justified because the elementary processes which are involved here are those associated to the collapse and they take place on very small time scales of order @xmath82 . ] .",
    "taking into account that after having hit the intermediate surface the trajectory may go back to @xmath112 an arbitrary number of times ( these correspond to interrupted attempts to transit from @xmath112 to @xmath98 or @xmath99 ) , we get for the transition probabilities as @xmath181 recall that @xmath150 and hence @xmath172 .",
    "we now need an estimation of the mean hitting position @xmath182 . to get it ,",
    "we pick @xmath183 small enough so that the noisy terms in eq.([eq : expanded ] ) become sub - dominant and the dqd trajectories are then governed ( approximatively , but more and more exactly as @xmath183 is decreased ) by the deterministic drift terms . for @xmath184 small , that is to leading order in @xmath183 , the sdes ( [ eq : expanded ] ) become @xmath185 and @xmath186 , so that @xmath187 and @xmath188",
    ". hence , @xmath189 we actually get a bit more because we can also estimate the mean time @xmath190 the dqd trajectories stay near the @xmath112-corner . indeed ,",
    "within the above approximation scheme , the typical time to reach for the first instance the intermediate surface starting from @xmath112 is of order @xmath191 .",
    "taking again into account the fact that the dqd trajectories may go back to @xmath112 an arbitrary number of times after having hit the intermediate surface , we get @xmath192    we here implement the same strategy by slicing the simplex at an intermediate scale @xmath183 away from the @xmath98-corner .",
    "we similarly get that the transition probabilities starting from @xmath98 are @xmath193 where @xmath180 now denote averages with respect to the probability distribution of the hitting position on the intermediate surface at a distance @xmath183 from @xmath98 .",
    "we still have to evaluate the mean hitting positions @xmath194 , the only difference compared to the previous discussion is that now the @xmath47-dynamics is relevant . as above",
    "we estimate this mean position by linearizing the dynamics for @xmath195 small . to leading order",
    ", we have @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "hence , asymptotically @xmath199 and the mean hitting position is at @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "thus @xmath202 the mean time @xmath203 the qdq trajectories spend near the @xmath98-corner is evaluated as above : @xmath204 the transition rates starting from the @xmath99-corner are evaluated similarly by exchanging @xmath16 and @xmath18 .      all formulas for @xmath205 or @xmath206 or @xmath207 , as well as for the mean times",
    "spend around each of the corners , correspond to the transition probabilities for a markov chain with transition rates @xmath208 we thus conclude that the dqd trajectory may approximatively be described by an effective @xmath162-state markov chain whose master equation reads @xmath209 with @xmath210 the probabilities for the dqd trajectory to be in the state @xmath112 , @xmath99 or @xmath98 ; that is , @xmath57 are the probabilities for the dqd quantum trajectory to be near the @xmath112- , @xmath99- , or @xmath98-corners .",
    "notice that equations ( [ eq : expanded ] ) for the dqd quantum trajectories do not contain any counting process . for a strong measurement intensity",

    "fluctuations of charge transfer can be approximatively computed using large deviation techniques for markov chains .",
    "standard results of probability theory therefore apply , and in particular the fluctuation relations@xcite apply to the charge transfer statistics at least within the markov chain approximation .",
    "computing numerically the average flux directly from the stochastic differential equation is an easy but cumbersome task . for a finite measurement strength , the system will not be exactly in the basis state vectors , i.e. the quantum trajectory will not remain exactly on the vertices of the triangle we previously defined .",

    "fortunately , the results do not depend on this cutoff at the strong measurement limit .",

    "a strong measurement intensity also means that the jumps get sharper thus requiring a small discretisation step . as a consequence , naively discretising the sde using a euler scheme and a constant step proves to be insufficient to compute the flux in a reasonable amount of time .",

    "the situation can be further improved using an adaptive discretisation scheme .",
    "indeed , the system spends most of the time evolving slowly around basis state and very rarely jumps in a sharp evolution .",

    "the error bars provided in this paper are thus pure monte - carlo errors .",
