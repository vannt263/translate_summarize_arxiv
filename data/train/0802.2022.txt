    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are short - period , semi - detached compact binaries in which the primary star , a white dwarf ( wd ) , accretes matter and angular momentum from the secondary , a main - sequence star filling its roche lobe ( the mass donor ) @xcite . the matter is transferred by means of either an accretion disk around the wd , or an accretion column or curtain - when the wd has a strong magnetic field .",
    "ongoing accretion at a low rate ( quiescence ) can be interrupted every few weeks to months by intense accretion ( outburst ) of days to weeks ( a dwarf nova accretion event ) , and every few thousand years by a thermonuclear runaway explosion ( tnr - the classical nova event , due to the ignition of the accreted layer of hydrogen - rich material ) .",
    "cvs are divided in sub - classes according to the duration , occurrence and amplitude of their outbursts .",
    "the two main types of cvs are dwarf nova systems ( dns ; weakly- or non - magnetic disk systems found mostly in their quiescent state which lasts much longer than their outburst ) , and nova - like ( nl ) systems which form a less homogeneous class .",
    "nls includes disk systems found mostly in their high state , intermediate polars ( ips ; with a magnetically truncated inner disk ) , polars ( devoid of disk due to the strong magnetic field of the wd ) , and other systems e.g. that never go into outburst or which can not be classified as dns @xcite ( this includes the helium systems - am cvn - with the shortest period ) .",
    "dwarf nova systems includes the u gem systems , the su uma systems , and the z cam systems .",
    "the u gem systems are the typical dns , i.e. those systems exhibiting normal dn outbursts ; the su umas exhibit both normal dn outbursts , and superoutbursts , which are both longer in duration and higher in luminosity than normal dn outbursts ; and the z cam systems have standstills where they remain in a state of intermediate optical brightness for a long time ( here we adopt the classification according to @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly enough , while the binary orbital period in cv systems ranges from a fraction of an hour ( am cvn systems ) to about a day ( e.g. gk per ) , there is a gap in the orbital period between 2 and 3 hours where almost no systems are found ( hereafter the `` period gap '' ) . for example u gem and z cam dn systems are found above the period gap , while the su uma dn systems are found below the period gap .",
    "it is not known whether the systems are evolving from a longer period to a shorter period ( across the gap ) or whether the systems above the gap are altogether different from the systems below the gap .",
    "the now widely accepted interpretation of the quiescence / outburst cycle is the disk instability model ( dim , @xcite ) .",
    "it is assumed that during the quiescent phase the matter in the disk is cold and neutral and the disk is optically thin because of its low density , while during outburst the matter in the disk is ionized and becomes optically thick as the mass accretion rate within the disk increases .",
    "the basic principle of the dim theory depends heavily on the unknown viscosity parameter @xmath0 @xcite and on the mass transfer rate during the different phases .",
    "dns , unlike other cvs , offer a fairly reliable estimate of their distances via the absolute magnitude at maximum versus orbital period relation for dns found by @xcite .",
    "this relationship is consistent with theory @xcite .",
    "the mass accretion rate within the disk has been taken from @xcite , which is , however , only a first order estimate . in the last decade",
    ", the disk mass accretion rate of many systems has been deduced more accurately at given epochs of outburst or quiescence using spectral fitting techniques .",
    "the accretion rate is usually a function of time ( especially during the outburst itself ; and it is also a function of radius @xmath1 due to wind - outflow from the disk ) and , consequently , it is difficult to assess its time - averaged value accurately .",
    "recent advances in theory @xcite have shown that the average mass accretion rate onto the wd in dns can be deduced if one knows the mass of the accreting wd and its effective surface temperature during quiescence , therefore providing an additional and independent way to assess @xmath2 ( or more precisely @xmath3 - the mass accretion rate at one stellar radius @xmath4 _ onto _ the stellar surface , which might be different than the mass accretion rate in the disk @xmath5 at a radius @xmath1 if there is an outflow from the disk : @xmath6 . ) .",
    "consequently , in order to put more constraints on the theories we need to know the properties ( mainly the temperature and mass of the wd ) of these systems above as well as below the period gap .",
    "there is , however , a critical shortage in knowledge of the wd properties ( effective temperature @xmath7 , gravity @xmath8 , projected rotational velocity @xmath9 , chemical abundances , accretion belts ? ) in dns above the period gap .",
    "thus , detailed comparisons of accreting wds above and below the gap can not be made .",
    "for systems below the gap , with orbital periods near the period minimum @xcite , the distribution of temperatures are centered at @xmath1015,000k with only a narrow range identified at present .",
    "this distribution appears to manifest the effect of long term compressional heating at a time averaged accretion rate of @xmath11yr@xmath12 ( townsley and bildsten 2002 ; sion et al .",
    "it appears that wd @xmath13 s for systems above the gap are higher than wd temperatures in systems below the gap , due to the systems above the gap having larger disks ( with higher mass transfer rates ) and more massive ( somewhat earlier - type ) secondaries .",
    "some disks may remain optically thick even during quiescence so that the wds are heated to a greater extent than systems below the gap .",
    "it is not yet known whether the wds in systems above the gap are rotating more slowly than wds in systems below the gap where presumably the cvs are older and with a longer history of angular momentum transfer via disk accretion .",
    "thus far the only dns above the gap whose wds and disks / boundary layers have been analyzed with _",
    "_ iue _ and _ hst _ have been z cam @xcite , rx and @xcite , u gem @xcite , ss aur @xcite , ey cyg @xcite , ru peg @xcite and ww cet @xcite ; a total of 2 z cam systems , 4 u gem systems and the peculiar dn ww ceti ( although classified as a u gem , others suggest it is a z cam ) .    under our broader _ hst _ archival research we have started to secure accurate system parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath13 , @xmath9 , chemical abundances , etc .. ) for cvs ( dns and nls ) above and below the period gap by fitting synthetic spectral models ( wds and accretion disks ) to combined _ fuse_+_hst _ spectra from the mast archive .",
    "we have identified 25 cv systems for which the _ fuse _ and _ hst _ ( stis , fos or ghrs ) spectra match and can be combined . as a part of this _ hst _ archival research , we present in this paper the analysis of _ hst_/stis and ( _ fuse _ ) archival spectra of 5 dns during quiescence using synthetic stellar spectra together with the _ fuse _ spectrum of ru peg .",
    "the five dns are listed in table 1 with their system parameters as follows : column ( 1 ) name , ( 2 ) cv subtype , ( 3 ) reddening value e(b - v ) , ( 4 ) distance , ( 5 ) orbital period in days , ( 6 ) orbital inclination in degrees , ( 7 ) spectral type of the secondary , ( 8) mass of the primary in solar masses , ( 9 ) mass of the secondary in solar masses , ( 10 ) apparent magnitude in outburst , and ( 11 ) apparent magnitude in quiescence .",
    "the references are listed below the table .",
    "three systems are above the period gap : ey cyg , ss aur and ru peg ; and two systems are below the period gap : vw hyi and ek tra",
    ".    among these 5 objects , 4 dns in quiescence are directly from our _ hst _ archival program with matching _ fuse _ and _ hst_/stis spectra : ey cyg , ss aur , vw hyi , and ek tra .",
    "we supplement this study here with the analysis of ru peg s _ fuse _ spectrum . for ss aur , vw hyi and ek tra",
    "we assess the wd parameters by modeling for the first time for these 3 objects the combined _",
    "fuse_+stis spectra . for ru peg s",
    "_ fuse _ spectrum , and ey cyg s combined _ fuse_+stis spectrum we improve the fittings that were carried out previously .    for all the spectra we present here",
    ", we use the latest versions of the stellar model atmospheres and synthetic spectra codes ( see section 3 ) ; this includes options for the treatment of the hydrogen molecular satellite lines ( for modeling cooler wds ) , and nlte atmosphere models ( for modeling hotter wds ) .",
    "we also adopt the extinction values e(b - v ) given in @xcite for the 5 objects and we deredden the spectra accordingly . for some systems we identify the ism molecular absorption lines in the _ fuse _ spectra ; this greatly helps improve the fitting of the chemical abundances and wd s temperature .",
    "ru peg has stronger ism absorption lines and , for this system only , we model the ism atomic and molecular hydrogen opacities . for these 5 systems",
    "we obtain the temperature , projected rotational velocity and chemical abundances ( of c , n , s and si ) of the exposed wd atmosphere .",
    "we also give upper and lower limits for the mass of the wd and the distance to the system .",
    "the observations log is presented in table 2 . from the _ aavso _ ( american association of variable stars observers ) data",
    ", we found that all the systems were in optical quiescence at the time of the observation ( see the last column of table 2 ) .",
    "the stis spectra of ey cyg and ss aur are snapshots ( lasting 600 - 700s ) with a lower resolution and s / n than the stis spectra of vw hyi and ek tra . with fluxes @xmath16ergs@xmath17s@xmath12@xmath18@xmath12 ,",
    "both ey cyg and ek tra are actually weak _ fuse _ sources , and ru peg ( though with a _ fuse _ flux ten times higher ) is under - exposed with an exposure time of only 2800s .        _ fuse _ s optical system consists of four optical telescopes ( mirrors ) , each connected to a rowland spectrograph .",
    "the four diffraction gratings of the four spectrographs produce four independent spectra on two detectors .",
    "two mirrors and two gratings are coated with sic to provide wavelength coverage below 1020  , and the other two mirrors and gratings are coated with al and lif .",
    "the al+lif coating provides about twice the reflectivity of sic at wavelengths @xmath191050  , and very little reflectivity below 1020  .",
    "these are known as the sic1 , sic2 , lif1 and lif2 channels .",
    "all the _ fuse _ spectra presented here were obtained through the 30``x30 '' lwrs large square aperture in time tag mode .",
    "the data were processed with calfuse version 3.0.7 @xcite , which automatically handles event bursts .",
    "event bursts are short periods during an exposure when high count rates are registered on one or more detectors .",
    "the bursts exhibit a complex pattern on the detector , their cause , however , is yet unknown ( it has been confirmed that they are not detector effects ) .",
    "the main change from previous versions of calfuse is that now the data are maintained as a photon list ( the intermediate data file - idf ) throughout the pipeline .",
    "bad photons are flagged but not discarded , so the user can examine , filter , and combine data without re - running the pipeline .",
    "a number of design changes enable the new pipeline to run faster and use less disk space than before .",
    "processing time with calfuse has decreased by a factor of up to 10 .    to process _ fuse _ data ,",
    "we follow the same procedure used previously for the analysis of other systems ( such as ww ceti , @xcite ) ; consequently we give only a short account of this procedure .",
    "the spectral regions covered by the spectral channels overlap , and these overlap regions are then used to renormalize the spectra in the sic1 , lif2 , and sic2 channels to the flux in the lif1 channel .",
    "we then produced a final spectrum that covers the full _ fuse _ wavelength range @xmath20  .",
    "the low sensitivity portions of each channel were discarded . in most channels there",
    "exists a narrow dark stripe of decreased flux in the spectra running in the dispersion direction .",
    "this stripe has been known as the `` worm '' and it can attenuate as much as 50% of the incident light in the affected portions of the spectrum ; - this is due to shadows thrown by the wires on the grid above the detector . because of the temporal changes in the strength and position of the `` worm '' , calfuse can not correct target fluxes for its presence .",
    "therefore , we carried out a visual inspection of the _ fuse _ channels to locate the worm and we _ manually _ discarded the portion of the spectrum affected by the worm .",
    "we combined the individual exposures and channels to create a time - averaged spectrum weighting the flux in each output datum by the exposure time and sensitivity of the input exposure and channel of origin .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectra of dns in quiescence exhibit mainly absorption lines from the wd itself , as the exposed wd is the main fuv component of the system .",
    "a second fuv component is sometimes present as a flat and featureless continuum contributing in the very short wavelengths of _ fuse _ ( @xmath21  ) .",
    "this second component could be a hot region of the accretion disk ( the inner disk ) or the boundary / spread layer .",
    "sharp absorption lines from circumstellar ( or circumbinary ) material and/or the ism are also often seen and , if the system is a weak _ fuse _ source , sharp emission lines from air glow ( geo- and helio - coronal in origin ) are present    since the wd is the main component of the fuv spectra of dns in quiescence , the main characteristic of the _ fuse _ spectra is the broad ly@xmath22 absorption feature due to the gravity ( @xmath23 ) and temperature ( @xmath24k@xmath25k ) of the exposed wd ( in the disk this feature is usually smoothed out due to velocity broadening , unless the disk is almost face - on ) .",
    "the other most common absorption features observed in the spectra of dns wds are due to ciii ( 1175  ) , cii ( 1066  ) , siiii ( @xmath261108 - 1114   and @xmath261140 - 1144  ) , and nii ( 1085   when not contaminated by air glow ) . at higher temperatures ( t@xmath27k ) , as the continuum rises in the shorter wavelengths , the higher orders of the lyman series also become visible ; however , they become narrower . at these temperatures",
    "the siv ( 1073  ) absorption line starts to appear , and , as there is more flux in the shorter wavelengths , the cii ( 1010  ) absorption line also becomes visible . at still higher temperature ( t@xmath28k ) , the cii and siiii lines disappear , and the spectrum becomes dominated by high order ionization lines such as niv ( @xmath26923  ) , svi ( 933.5 & 944.5  ) , siv ( 1063 & 1073  ) , siiv ( 1066.6  ) , and oiv ( 1067.8  ) .    on top of the spectrum of the wd",
    ", broad emission lines are found in quiescent dn systems , usually the ovi doublet and ciii ( 977  and 1175  ) .",
    "these , together with broad emission lines from niv ( @xmath26923  ) and svi ( 933.5 & 944.5  ) are often observed in nova - like systems ( e.g. such as ae aqr , v347 pup , dw uma , see the mast _ fuse _ archives ) and are not usually present in low - inclination dn systems in quiescence .",
    "this implies that the gas could possibly be heated by a shock ( e.g. in the boundary layer ) and the broadening and variation of the lines suggests they are originating in the disk .",
    "this scenario has recently been supported by @xcite who for the first time modeled the broad h and he emission lines _",
    "ab initio _ as irradiation of the inner disk by the hot boundary layer and/or white dwarf .",
    "one fully expects that the metallic emission lines form in the same way .",
    "the dn system here that exhibits the strongest emission lines is ek tra ( i=58@xmath29 ) .",
    "ru peg ( i=33@xmath29 ) does have some strong emission lines too , but lacks a stis spectrum for complete comparison ; however , its _ iue _ spectrum clearly show strong emission lines such as civ ( 1550 ) and siiv ( 1400 ) .",
    "+ the _ fuse _ spectra of the dn systems ( and cvs in general ) often show some ism molecular hydrogen absorption , which appears as sharp lines at almost equal intervals ( 12 ) starting at wavelengths around 1110  and continuing towards shorter wavelengths all the way down to the hydrogen cut - off around 915  . in the affected _ fuse _ spectra , we identified the most prominent molecular hydrogen absorption lines by their band ( werner or lyman ) , upper vibrational level ( 1 - 16 ) , and rotational transition ( r , p , or q ) with lower rotational state ( j=1,2,3 ) .",
    "all the stis spectra were processed with calstis version 2.19 . except for the spectrum of ek tra ( obtained in time tag operation mode ) ,",
    "all the spectra were obtained in accum operation mode .",
    "all the stis spectra used the fuv mama detector and all were centered on the wavelength 1425  .",
    "the stis snapshots ( with an exposure time of about 600 - 700s , for ey cyg and ss aur ) were obtained through the 52x0.2 aperture using the g140l optical element .",
    "these snapshots consist of one spectrum .",
    "the stis spectra of vw hyi and ek tra ( with an exposure time of 4,000s and above ) were obtained through the 0.2x0.2 aperture using the e140 m optical elements , and with 42 echelle spectra each , are of a much higher resolution than the snapshots . towards the longer wavelengths ,",
    "the echelle spectra do not overlap and five gaps are apparent around @xmath301634 , 1653 , 1672 , 1691 , and 1710 .",
    "the stis spectra of quiescent dns are also dominated by the wd and their main characteristic is the broad ly@xmath0 absorption feature at @xmath261216  .",
    "the other very common absorption lines are the carbon lines ci ( 1266  , 1561  , 1657  ) , cii ( 1335  ) , and ciii ( 1175  ) ; and the silicon lines siii ( 1260  , 1300  , 1530  ) , siiii ( 1300  ) , and siiv ( 1400  ) .",
    "the _ hst_/stis spectrum also exhibits some broad emission lines .",
    "the most prominent ones are ciii ( 1175 ) , civ ( 1550 ) , siiii ( 1206 ) , nv ( 1240 ) , heii ( 1640  balmer @xmath0 ) , and siiv ( 1400 ) . with their broad emission lines , both the _ fuse _ and",
    "_ hst_/stis spectra show evidence of hot gas .      for four objects ( ey cyg ,",
    "ss aur , vw hyi and ek tra ) we wish to combine the _ fuse _ spectrum with the _ hst_/stis spectrum in order to have a larger wavelength coverage and improve the synthetic spectral modeling .",
    "however , for each object , before combining the _ fuse _ spectrum with the stis spectrum we must make sure that ( i ) the system was observed in the same ( high or low ) state ; ( ii ) the shape of the spectra ( continuum and lines ) is similar ( if the spectra are not too noisy ) ; ( iii ) the flux level in the _ fuse _ and _ hst_/stis spectra do not differ more than about 50% ( _ fuse _ and _ hst_/stis are very different instruments , we do not expect their flux level to match exactly ) ; ( iv ) for long period systems for which only short exposure time spectra exist , the _ fuse _ and stis spectra have most probably been obtained at a different binary orbital phase and it is not clear one can combine such spectra .",
    "we address these points here in detail as follows .",
    "\\(i ) the observations listed here were not coordinated and consequently some were carried out during early quiescence while others were carried out in late quiescence .",
    "for ey cyg , the outburst recurrence time is believed to be about 2000 days and the _ fuse _ and stis spectra were obtained in deep quiescence .",
    "ek tra has also a long outburst recurrence time and it was observed in deep quiescence ( 45 days and 155 days after outburst ) . for ss aur , both spectra were obtained about a month into quiescence . for vw hyi",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum was obtained 11 days into quiescence while the main stis spectrum was obtained 15 days into quiescence ( we discuss vw hyi in some more detail in the results section ) .",
    "\\(ii ) for all the systems , a visual analysis shows that the shape of the continuum and lines is similar in the _ fuse _ and stis spectra .",
    "\\(iii ) 0nly 2 systems ( ey cyg and ss aur ) have _ fuse _ and stis flux levels that do not match exactly . for ey",
    "cyg the stis spectrum had to be multiplied by 1.5 to match the flux level of the continuum in the _ fuse _ spectrum , while for ss aur it was multiplied by 0.93 . at temperatures of about 25,000k",
    "a change of 2,000k can produce a change of 50 percent in the flux ; the accuracy of the temperature we obtained for ey cyg is therefore of this order ( i.e. @xmath312,000k ) .",
    "\\(iv ) since the systems were observed in quiescence , we expect mainly to see the exposed wd with basically no contribution or occultation from the accretion disk ( none of these systems is eclipsing ) .",
    "the spectra , whether observed at a given phase or averaged over an entire orbit , should not differ significantly .",
    "only for spectra with a high s / n ratio and a high inclination do we expect the absorption and emission lines to exhibit some red- or blue- shift if they were obtained at a given orbital phase , while the orbit - averaged spectra will have broader absorption and emission features .    except for ru peg ,",
    "all the _ fuse _ spectra exposure times cover a significant fraction of the orbital period ( and in some cases several periods ) ; therefore , the _ fuse _ spectra are averaged over a significantly large fraction of the orbit .",
    "the stis spectra of vw hyi and ek tra are also averaged over the orbit , and for these two systems one can therefore combine the _ fuse _ and stis spectra .",
    "the stis snapshots of ey cyg and ss aur are very short ( less than 1ksec ) and were taken at a particular orbital phase .",
    "one might therefore argue that the stis and _ fuse _ spectra of ey cyg and ss aur can not be combined because of that .",
    "however , for both ey cyg and ss aur , they fit except that the absorption lines in the stis range are not as deep as in the _ fuse _ range .",
    "the effect of observing the systems at a particular orbital phase is not very pronounced , and this might be due to the lower resolution of the stis snapshots ( in comparison to vw hyi and ek tra s stis spectra ) and the moderate inclination of ey cyg and ss aur .",
    "therefore , for ey cyg and ss aur , we also combine the _ fuse _ and stis spectra without concern about the orbital phase .",
    "the only object for which we find a significant shift in the lines is the long period system ru peg , for which we only have a _ fuse _ spectrum of 2,800s .",
    "finally , we deredden the spectra according to the e(b - v ) values given in @xcite .",
    "we create model spectra for high - gravity stellar atmospheres using codes tlusty and synspec @xcite .",
    "atmospheric structure was computed ( using tlusty ) assuming a h - he lte atmosphere ; the other species were added in the spectrum synthesis stage using synspec . for hot models ( say @xmath32k ) we switched the approximate nlte treatment option in synspec ( this allows to consider and approximate nlte treatment even for lte models generated by tlusty ) .",
    "we generate photospheric models with effective temperatures ranging from 12,000k to 75,000k in increments of about 10 percent ( e.g. 1,000k for t@xmath2615,000k and 5,000k for t@xmath2670,000k ) .",
    "we chose values of @xmath8 ranging between 7.5 and 9.5 for consistency with the observed mass .",
    "we also varied the stellar rotational velocity @xmath9 from @xmath33km@xmath17s@xmath12 to @xmath34km@xmath17s@xmath12 in steps of @xmath33km@xmath17s@xmath12 ( or smaller if needed ) . in order to try and fit the absorption features of the spectrum",
    ", we also vary the chemical abundances of c , n , s and si . for any wd mass",
    "there is a corresponding radius , or equivalently one single value of @xmath8 ( e.g. see the mass radius relation from @xcite or see @xcite for different composition and non - zero temperature wds ) .",
    "our suite of stellar spectra generator codes has been implemented and includes also the treatment of the quasi - molecular satellite lyman lines .",
    "the satellite hydrogen lines appear as strong absorption features near 1400 and 1600   ( ly@xmath0 , in the iue and stis range ; @xcite ) and are somewhat weaker near 1060 and 1078   ( ly@xmath22 , in the _ fuse _ range ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "following @xcite , we used opacity tables computed by @xcite to take into account the quasi - molecular satellite line opacities of h@xmath35 and h@xmath36 for ly@xmath0 , ly@xmath22 , and ly@xmath37 .",
    "the quasi - molecular lines are expected to appear when the temperature of the wd is @xmath2620,000k or lower , though the gravity , pressure and magnetic field of the wd can also play a role in the formation of these lines ( larger electronic density will favor recombination , see e.g. @xcite for a more complete discussion ) .      for all the systems showing ism atomic and molecular hydrogen absorption lines , we identify these lines in the figures to avoid confusing them with the wd lines . for ru peg , however , some ism lines are deep and broad and we decided to model them , especially since some of the wd lines ( such as siv @xmath381062.6 & 1073 ) are located at almost the same wavelengths .    for ru peg only , we model the ism hydrogen absorption lines to assess the atomic and molecular column densities .",
    "this enables us to differentiate between the wd lines and the ism lines , and helps improve the wd spectral fit .",
    "the ism spectra models are generated using a program developed by p.e .",
    "this program uses a custom spectral fitting package to estimate the temperature and density of the interstellar absorption lines of atomic and molecular hydrogen .",
    "the ism model assumes that the temperature , bulk velocity , and turbulent velocity of the medium are the same for all atomic and molecular species , whereas the densities of atomic and molecular hydrogen , and the ratios of deuterium to hydrogen and metals ( including helium ) to hydrogen can be adjusted independently .",
    "the model uses atomic data of @xcite and molecular data of @xcite .",
    "the optical depth calculations of molecular hydrogen have been checked against those of @xcite .",
    "the ratios of metals to hydrogen and deuterium to hydrogen are fixed at 0 and @xmath39 , respectively , because of the low signal - to - noise ratio data .",
    "the wings of the atomic lines are used to estimate the density of atomic hydrogen and the depth of the unsaturated molecular lines for molecular hydrogen .",
    "the temperature and turbulent velocity of the medium are primarily determined from the lines of molecular hydrogen when the ism temperatures are @xmath40k .",
    "the ism absorption features are best modeled and displayed when the theoretical ism model ( transmission values ) is combined with a synthetic spectrum for the object ( namely a wd synthetic spectrum ) .      before carrying out a synthetic spectral fit of the spectra , we masked portions of the spectra with strong emission lines , strong ism molecular absorption lines , detector noise and air glow .",
    "these regions of the spectra are somewhat different for each object and are not included in the fitting .",
    "the regions excluded from the fit are in blue in figures 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 .",
    "the excluded ism quasi - molecular absorption lines are marked with vertical labels in figures 2 , 4 , and 9 . for ru peg , we model the ism absorption features and the wd separately ; namely , we also mask the ism absorption features when we model the wd .",
    "after having generated grids of models for each target , we use fit @xcite , a @xmath41 minimization routine , to compute the reduced @xmath42 ( @xmath41 per number of degrees of freedom ) and scale factor values for each model fit . while we use a @xmath41 minimization technique ,",
    "we do not blindly select the least @xmath41 models , but we examine the models that best fit some of the features such as absorption lines ( see the fit to the _ fuse _ spectrum alone ) and , when possible , the slope of the wings of the broad lyman absorption features .",
    "we also select the models that are in agreement with the known distance of the system .",
    "however , in the model fitting , for a given wd mass and radius , the resulting temperature depends mainly on the shape of the spectrum in the _ fuse _ range .",
    "the flux level at 1000  ( between ly@xmath43 and ly@xmath37 ) is close to zero for temperatures below 18,000k , at 30,000k it is about 50% of the continuum level at 1100  and it reaches 100% for t@xmath1945,000k . at higher temperature ( t@xmath1950,000k )",
    "the spectrum becomes pretty flat and there is not much difference in the shape of the spectrum between ( say ) a 50,000k and a 80,000k model .",
    "when fitting the shape of the spectrum in such a manner , an accuracy of about 500 - 1,000k is obtained , due to the s / n . in theory , a fine tuning of the temperature ( say to an accuracy of about @xmath3150k ) can be carried out by fitting the flux levels such that the distance to the system ( if known ) is obtained accurately .",
    "however , the fitting to the distance depends strongly on the radius ( and therefore the mass ) of the wd . in all the systems presented here",
    "the error on the measured mass of the wd is so large ( see table 1 ) that it produces an error in the temperature much larger than 1,000k .",
    "this is because the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath22 profiles depend on both temperature and gravity .",
    "for example @xcite derived a best fit temperature for ek tra @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the ( unknown ) surface gravity of the wd ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "additional errors are further introduced as the distance and reddening are rarely known accurately , therefore increasing significantly the inaccuracy of assessing the temperature by scaling the synthetic flux to the observed flux . for these , we decided to fit the temperature of each model , based on the shape of the _ fuse _ spectrum in the shorter wavelengths , for a temperature accuracy of only about 5% , namely accurate to within 500k for t@xmath47k ; 1,000k for 20,000k@xmath48t@xmath4835,000k ; and 2,000k for t@xmath1940,000k ( see the results section ) .",
    "while the error in temperature is only 500k for a 18,000k model and 2,000k for a 50,000k model , the relative error @xmath49 is the same for all the models .    for all models we first tried fitting solar abundance models and then tried changing the abundances of some species to improve the spectral fit .",
    "in particular , for each system we fit obvious absorption features which can determine the abundance of some specific element ( c , si , s , n ) . for example , the cii ( @xmath261065   ) , the siiii ( @xmath261110   ) and the si - c blend ( @xmath261138 - 1146   ) are the main absorption features in the _ fuse _ range of a t=20,000k wd that help assess the si and the c abundances ( these are discussed in detail for each system in the next section ) .",
    "the wd rotation ( @xmath9 ) rate is determined by fitting the wd model to the spectrum while paying careful attention to the line profiles in the _ fuse _ portion of the combined spectrum .",
    "we did not carry out separate fits to individual lines but rather tried to fit the lines and continuum in the same fit while paying careful attention to the absorption lines .",
    "it is important to note that , in the modeling , the depth of the absorption features depends not only on the abundances but also on the rotational velocity . increasing the rotational velocity decreases the depth of the absorption features , but broadens the wings - the net effect being that higher metal abundances result with faster rotational velocity . with sufficiently high s",

    "an additional characteristic which makes ey cyg a peculiar dn is its anomalous nv / civ ratio .",

    "the stis snapshot spectrum was binned at the default value of 0.58 .",
    "consequently the relative weight of the _ stis _ spectrum is about twice as large as that of the _ fuse _ spectrum . in preparation for the model fitting we had to multiply the stis flux by 1.5 to match the _ fuse _ flux level ; this change of 50% in flux corresponds to a @xmath55 10% in the value of @xmath56 .",

    "we found that the stis spectrum gave the same temperature , however with a distance about 20 percent larger as the main driving elements in choosing the best fit model were the same , namely : the ly@xmath0 profile and the longer wavelengths of stis .",
    "fitting the _ fuse _ spectrum alone gave a temperature about 2,000k higher than for the combined spectrum .",
    "we therefore inferred for ey cyg @xmath68k@xmath69k assuming @xmath59 .",

    "also we found that the inclusion of the quasi - molecular satellite hydrogen line opacity improves the fit significantly , especially in the _ fuse _ range where the flux suddenly drops shortward of the nitrogen absorption line at 1184  . in the stis range",
    "this is not as pronounced but the drop in flux is also apparent shortward of the si emission lines ( 1400 ) .",
    "the distance we obtained is at most 137pc ( @xmath120 ) , somewhere between @xcite estimate and @xcite .",
    "the temperatures we obtained here are lower than @xcite .",
    "the differences between our result and @xcite are probably due to the fact that , in their analysis , @xcite did not include the opacity of the quasi - molecular satellite hydrogen lines , and they did not deredden the spectrum ( it has e(b - v)=0.03 ; @xcite ) . they interpreted the excess of flux in the longer wavelengths of stis ( @xmath191,550 ) as possible emission from an optically thin accretion disk during quiescence , while we found , after dereddening the spectra , no evidence of flux excess .",
    "we note here that the complete absence of ism molecular hydrogen absorption lines in the _ fuse _ spectrum of ek tra suggests that the system might indeed be located rather nearby ( say @xmath48150pc ) . for comparison , in the present work",
    ", only the _ fuse _ spectrum of vw hyi at 65pc shows such a complete absence , while ss aur at 200pc clearly shows some molecular hydrogen lines .",
    "we therefore speculate that the system is probably located at about 125pc , as supported by our results .",
    "ru peg is a u gem type dn with an orbital period @xmath85 = 8.99 hrs , a system inclination @xmath122 , a secondary spectral type k2 - 5v , and a primary ( wd ) mass @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "the near - chandrasekhar mass for the wd has been corroborated by the sodium ( 8190 ) doublet radial velocity study of @xcite .",
    "they obtained a mass of 1.24 m@xmath124 for the wd and also found very good agreement with the range of plausible inclinations , found in the study by @xcite .",
    "recently , a hubble fgs parallax of @xmath125 mas was measured by @xcite implying a distance of 282pc .",
    "@xcite analyzed 4 iue spectra of ru peg obtained in deep quiescence , and found a wd temperature t@xmath126k with a distance of @xmath10 250 pc , assuming @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "more recently , a _ fuse _ spectrum of ru peg was obtained 60 days after outburst .",
    "the _ fuse _ observation lasted for a little more than 3000s ( raw exposure time ) .",
    "from all the 5 systems in this analysis , ru peg is the most affected by ism absorption lines .",
    "we show the _ fuse _ spectrum of ru peg with line identifications in figure 9 , where we have marked only the most prominent molecular hydrogen lines .",
    "two modelings have been carried out @xcite for the _ fuse _ spectrum of ru peg ; and both found a wd temperature similar to @xcite assuming @xmath129 .    while we are confident that the wd in ru peg is actually massive and that its temperature is very large ( @xmath1950,000k ) , the _ fuse _ spectrum has never been modeled in detail as many of the ism molecular hydrogen lines were misidentified .",
    "in addition , since this _ fuse _ analysis was carried out , calfuse has been updated and we are making use of this implementation . for ru peg , we decided to also model the ism molecular and atomic hydrogen absorption lines to help improve the model fit .    in figure 10",
    "we show the best - fit model to the _ fuse _ spectrum of ru peg ( binned at 0.1 ) .",
    "this model consists of a synthetic wd spectrum model multiplied by the transmission values obtained from the ism model .",
    "this wd model has a temperature of 70,000k , a rotational velocity of 40km / s , @xmath101 , subsolar carbon and silicon abundances and supra solar nitrogen and sulfur abundances as follows .",
    "the silicon abundance was set to 0.2 times solar to match the siiv ( 1066  ) line .",
    "the nitrogen abundance was set to solar to match the niii ( 980 , 1183 , & 1184.5  ) lines .",
    "the carbon abundance was set to 0.2 times solar to match the feature at 1108   and the flat portion of the spectrum at 1160 - 1170  .",
    "the sulfur abundance was set to 10 times solar to match the strong absorption of the svi and siv lines .",
    "it is worth noting that if the n / c ratio is anomalous in the wd photosphere then this would imply recent thermonuclear processing in the wd , because the disk emission lines do not indicate a n / c ratio larger than one , but rather the opposite @xcite .",
    "however , our abundances determination is not robust because the nitrogen and carbon absorption lines are afffected by broad emission lines and ism molecular hydrogen absorption lines .",
    "the projected rotational velocity was found by matching the profile of the carbon , oxygen , silicon and sulfur lines , and in particular the square - shaped bottom of the ciii 1175   absorption feature .",
    "the ism model ( in figure 10 ) has zero metallicity , a temperature of 100k , a turbulent velocity of b=30km@xmath17s@xmath12 , a molecular hydrogen column density of @xmath130@xmath18 and an atomic hydrogen column density of @xmath131@xmath18 .",
    "this ism model fits best the stronger ( molecular hydrogen ) absorption lines but does fit the sharper and weaker ( molecular hydrogen ) absorption lines .",
    "it is worth noting that all the synthetic wd spectra we generate between @xmath132k up to @xmath133k ( with an approximate nlte line treatment option switched on in synspec and using lte stellar atmosphere models from tlusty ) fit the data similarly , the main difference is the radius ( and therefore mass and gravity ) of the wd which is fixed by scaling the model to the data assuming a distance of 282pc .",
    "consequently , the 50,000k model had @xmath134 , while the 70,000k model had @xmath101 .",
    "in order to agree with a mass of @xmath135 we ran models with @xmath136 with increasing temperatures and found that the model that agrees with the distance of 282pc has a temperature of 110,000k . at such a high temperature the siv , siiv and oiv lines",
    "between 1060and 1080are not deep enough to match the observed features .",
    "in addition , since we performed only the simplest nlte approximation , and also obtained @xmath137 ( against 0.539 for the t=70,000k model ) , we decided not to chose the 110,000k model as a best fit model .    on the other hand , at 50,000k , the oiv line and the nominally strong niv and svi lines are not pronounced .",
    "the temperature had to be increased to 70,000k to clearly show the appearance of these lines in the synthetic spectrum ( including the oiv line at 1067.8 ) .",
    "therefore , we chose the 70,000k model as our best fit model",
    ".    however , the siiv and oiv lines ( between 1066 and 1068  ) are contaminated by sharp ism absorption lines from molecular hydrogen ( l3p2 1066.90 , & l3r3 1067.48 ) and the ari 1066.66  line ( the other argon line ari 1048.20  is also present ) .",
    "however , these sharp ism lines were not modeled accurately in the ism model presented in figure 10 . consequently , in order to fit the sharper absorption lines of the ism we generated a second ism model .",
    "this model fits the sharp lines better but does not fit the stronger lines as well ( it is likely that the ism has more than one component ) .",
    "the second ism model has zero metallicity , a temperature of 300k , a turbulent velocity of b=10km@xmath17s@xmath12 , a molecular hydrogen column density of @xmath130@xmath18 and an atomic hydrogen column density of @xmath138@xmath18 and a blueshift velocity of -35km@xmath17s@xmath12 . in figure 11",
    "we present the 70,000k wd synthetic spectrum including the second ism model in the region 1060  - 1080  . from this model",
    "we see that the oiv line is distinct from the molecular hydrogen line ( l3r3 ) but it is not very strong . as for the siiv lines , they are contaminated by argon and a molecular hydrogen line ( l3p2 ) .",
    "since argon ( and iron , and all the metals ) is not included in the ism model , we can not confirm whether the siiv line is present .",
    "we also note that siv is shifted to the red compared to the wd model .",
    "indeed , a close look at all the lines from the system reveals that some of the ( broader ) lines are shifted by as much as 0.5  to the red ; this is especially the case for the svi , ovi , siv and ciii lines .",
    "this could be due to the motion of the wd in the binary , as the red shift is close to the maximum radial velocity shift of the wd in the system and the _ fuse _ spectrum had a duration much shorter than the binary period .",
    "it is possible that these strong absorption lines do not form in the stellar photosphere , but possibly in a corona above it or in a hot boundary layer in front of it .",
    "this can be determined only if we have line velocities in phase - resolved fuv spectra to compare with the velocity derived for photospheric lines in the white dwarf s rest frame .",
    "one of the improvements we made in the present work is the modeling of the quasi - molecular satellite lines of hydrogen in the _ fuse _ spectra of vw hyi and ek tra .",
    "such modeling has been carried out previously for cv wds such as wz sge @xcite and am her @xcite , and also for da wds @xcite and zz ceti wds @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with these results as the presence / absence of the quasi - molecular hydrogen lines in fuv spectra of wds is not yet fully understood .",
    "quasi - molecular satellite transitions take place during close collisions of the radiating hydrogen atom with a perturbing atom or proton .",
    "these absorption features are present in the red wings of the lyman series lines ( ly@xmath0 in stis and iue spectral ranges at 1400 & 1600  ; ly@xmath22 at 1058 & 1076  and ly@xmath37 around 995  - in the _ fuse _ spectral range ) and provide a noticeable source of opacity in the hydrogen - rich atmosphere of wds @xcite . in theory",
    "the h@xmath36 satellite appearance is very sensitive to the degree of ionization and may be used as a temperature diagnostic . on the other hand , since the quasi - molecular opacity is proportional to the proton and hi densities , the quasi - molecular satellite lines are expected to be observed at higher effective temperatures in wds with larger surface gravities @xcite .",
    "we summarize in table 6 the occurrence of the quasi - molecular satellite lines in a number of wds , covering a wide range of temperatures and gravities , listed in order of increasing temperature .",
    "we are aware that these wds belong to different types ( cvs , da and zz ceti ) and that the detection of the quasi - molecular satellite line also depends on the s / n of the data . however , this table might help put restrictions on the upper and lower limits of the gravity and temperature of wds , especially when the mass and distance are relatively unknown . for example",
    "it is clear that the wd of ey cyg must have @xmath139 , otherwise one would expect to see the quasi - molecular satellite lines in the _ fuse _ range . for ww",
    "cet the opposite is true and one can therefore expect @xmath140 .",
    "in fact one could argue that for ww cet @xmath141 while for ey cyg @xmath142 , as this would be even more consistent with table 6 and with the errors on the wd masses of these systems .",
    "however , the system that really stands out in the list is am her which exhibits the 1076  feature but not the one at 1058  .",
    "@xcite suggest that the magnetic field plays a role in the formation of these lines , and cite the fact the magnetic da wd pg 1658 + 441 has a weaker than expected 1058   @xmath143 absorption feature",
    ". however , @xcite mentioned that the treatment of the quasi - molecular satellite opacities could be improved , especially in the range of ionic densities encountered in the atmosphere of ultramassive wds .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum of pg 1658 + 441 actually shows that both the 1058  and 1076  absorption features are rather weak , contrary to am her where the 1058  feature is completely absent .",
    "we see the importance of generating a large database of wds exhibiting the quasi - molecular satellite lines of hydrogen , as it could be used to assess the wd s temperature and/or gravity more accurately .",
    "we have analyzed the fuv spectra of five dns in quiescence with the aim of securing more accurate values of system parameters , such as the wd surface temperatures @xmath13 , their projected rotational velocities @xmath144 ( derived mainly from the _ fuse _ data ) , their chemical abundances , their surface gravities and the distances to the systems .",
    "four of these systems ( ey cyg , ss aur , vw hyi , and ek tra ) were part of our broader _ hst _ archival program with matching _ fuse _ and _ hst_/stis spectra , while ru peg has only one _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "we carried out the analysis including options for the treatment of the hydrogen molecular satellite lines ( for modeling cooler wds ) and nlte atmosphere models ( for modeling hotter wds ) , dereddening the spectra and identifying the ism molecular absorption lines in the _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "the following improvements ( in methods and results ) were achieved .    for ey cyg , we disregarded the noisy portion of the _ fuse _ spectrum ( @xmath145 ) , which turned out to be an artifact of the re - processing and thus improved the fit . from the",
    "hst_/stis + _ fuse _ spectrum we found @xmath82k and d=530pc assuming @xmath78 ; and @xmath146k and d=310pc assuming @xmath147 .",
    "we derived for the first time evidence of cno processing in the photosphere of the wd itself in ey cyg .",
    "previously , only the emission line strengths implied suprasolar",
    "n and subsolar ( deficient ) c. therefore ey cyg s wd is only the third wd known to have anomalous n / c in its photosphere , the other objects being vw hyi and u gem .    for ss aur ,",
    "we re - evaluated and improved the wd parameters by modeling for the first time for this object the combined _",
    "fuse_+stis spectra .",
    "we improved the fitting in the _ fuse _ short wavelength range without the need to introduce a second component , contrary to @xcite s result where the second component actually gave too much flux .",
    "this might be due to the fact that @xcite did not deredden the _ fuse _ spectrum of ss aur , while we assumed e(b - v)=0.08 .",
    "in addition this result is in excellent agreement with the distance and we found no deficiency in carbon .",
    "we also improved the line identifications over the previously published _",
    "fuse _ analysis .    for vw hyi",
    ", the _ fuse _ and stis spectra were combined together for the first time .",
    "the opacity of the quasi - molecular satellite lines of hydrogen were included , and the spectrum was dereddened assuming e(b - v)=0.01 .",
    "our best model fit has @xmath13=22,000k , @xmath91 and @xmath148pc . both the projected rotational velocity ( 400km / s ) and the chemical abundances are determined quite accurately due to the high s / n of the _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "we find a ratio c / n=0.25/3=1/12 and the silicon abundance is almost twice solar .",
    "a second component is detected in the very short wavelengths contributing only a few percent of the total flux . even though we deliberately decided not to model the second component , our results are in complete agreement with all the results from previous analyses of the system @xcite .    for ek tra",
    "we re - evaluated and improved the wd parameters by modeling for the first time the combined _ fuse_+stis spectrum .",
    "we found a wd temperature of 17,000k@xmath311,000k assuming @xmath149 leading to a distance of @xmath26125pc .",
    "@xcite carried out a similar analysis , but found a somewhat higher temperature and a flux excess in the longer wavelengths , assuming a distance d@xmath19180pc .",
    "the difference in results is probably due to our different modeling ; namely we combined the _ fuse _ and stis spectra , included the opacity of the quasi - molecular satellite lines for hydrogen , and dereddened the spectrum .",
    "for ru peg we improved the line identifications over the previously published _",
    "analysis and we show that the large mass of the wd gives a better agreement with a higher temperature than previously estimated ; namely the @xmath101 model gives a temperature of 70,000k for a distance of 282pc .",
    "we find that the projected rotational velocity is rather small ( @xmath4870km / s ) and the carbon and silicon abundances are sub - solar ; while sulfur and nitrogen are over - abundant .",
    "we assessed the molecular hydrogen column density ( @xmath150@xmath18 ) , the atomic hydrogen column density ( @xmath151@xmath18 ) , and found that the lines are blue shifted with a velocity of -35km@xmath17s@xmath12 .",
