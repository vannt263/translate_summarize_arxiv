    "formation of multidimensional solitons and solitary vortices ( solitons with embedded vorticity ) has drawn a great deal of attention in studies of nonlinear optics and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , see review review .",

    "also reported were spatial solitons , vortices , and dipole - mode states in photorefractive crystals with a photo - induced lattice , where the nonlinearity is saturable @xcite .",
    "however , truly 2d or 3d solitons have not yet been observed in media with the generic cubic ( @xmath1 ) nonlinearity , the problem being their instability against the collapse @xcite .",
    "vortex solitons are subject ( in the uniform space ) to a still stronger azimuthal instability , which occurs even in the absence of the collapse @xcite .",
    "a relevant ingredient of both optical and bec settings which may stabilize multidimensional solitons and vortices is an effective periodic potential . in optics",
    ", it implies a periodic modulation of the refractive index in the transverse plane , as in photonic - crystal fibers ) , and in bec it is induced by optical lattices ( ols ) . in the medium with the self - focusing ( sf ) @xmath2",
    "nonlinearity , the stabilization of fundamental and vortical 2d solitons ( those with topological charges @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ) under the action of the square - lattice potential was predicted in works @xcite and @xcite ( see also works @xcite ; stable solitons were found too in photonic - crystal - fiber models @xcite ) .",
    "the action of the stabilization mechanism can be summarized as follows . in the free 2d space ,",
    "the @xmath1 nonlinearity supports a family of townes solitons ( tss ) , which have the same norm , @xmath5 , at all values of the propagation constants , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "although there are no unstable eigenvalues in the spectrum of small perturbations around townes solitons , a specific zero eigenvalue accounts for the instability against sub - exponentially growing perturbations , which is a manifestation of the _ critical character _ of the collapse induced by the @xmath1 nonlinearity in the 2d space . as demonstrated by numerical findings and the variational approximation ( va ) , the action of the ol potential with small strength @xmath7 lifts the degeneracy of the townes - soliton family , stretching the single point , @xmath5 , into interval @xmath8 of width @xmath9 , which is filled by stable solitons , that obey the vakhitov - kolokolov ( vk ) criterion , @xmath10 .",
    "this criterion is well known to be a necessary condition for the stability of solitons in media with sf nonlinearities @xcite .    as concerns vortex solitons supported by the square ol , the most compact  crater - shaped \" ones , represented by a single density peak with a vorticity - induced hole in the center , are unstable @xcite .",
    "stable vortices with @xmath11 can be built as sets of four ( or eight ) peaks , with the phase shift @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 , respectively ) between adjacent ones @xcite .",
    "stable vortices of higher orders , up to @xmath14 , built of up to @xmath15 peaks , were found too , as well as stable  supervortices \" , i.e. , ring chains of @xmath15 ( or more ) compacts vortices carrying local spins @xmath16 , with global vorticity @xmath17 imprinted onto the entire ring .",
    "these patterns were found in models with cubic and saturable sf nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "stable vortices of the gap - soliton type were also found in the model combining the ol and self - repulsive nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "a general mathematical classification of various localized states with an intrinsic phase structure ( in particular , vortices ) in the 2d model with the square - lattice @xmath18 potential and cubic nonlinearity was developed in @xcite .    in the 2d geometry , _ supercritical collapse _ is generated by the sf quintic ( @xmath19 ) nonlinearity , which may occur in a combination with @xmath20 terms . in optics , the cubic - quintic ( cq ) nonlinearity with the sf @xmath19 part was predicted @xcite and recently observed @xcite in aqueous colloids .",
    "it was also observed in dye solutions @xcite , and recently predicted , through the cascaded mechanism , in two - level media @xcite .",
    "it is relevant to mention that the @xmath21 nonlinearity with the self - defocusing sign is observed in various uniform optical media @xcite .    besides the context of nonlinear optics",
    ", the cq nonlinearity of the sf type appears in the description of bec with attraction between atoms trapped in a  pancake \" configuration .",
    "strictly speaking , the reduction of the underlying 3d gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) to the 2d form produces a more complex nonpolynomial nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "however , for 1d configurations corresponding to a cigar - shaped trap , it was demonstrated that the respective gpe with the sf quintic term , which represents a  vestige \" of the underlying multi - dimensionality , provides for an appropriate description of the soliton dynamics , unless one is interested in the collapse per se @xcite .",
    "another straightforward interpretation of the quintic term in the gpe is the contribution of three - body collisions , provided that the lossy part of this interaction ( kicking out atoms from the condensate ) may be neglected @xcite .",
    "the ol potential is not necessary for the stability of 1d solitons in the sf cq model , as they are stable in the free 1d space , despite the possibility of the collapse @xcite . on the contrary , in the 2d model with the sf @xmath20 and @xmath19 nonlinearities , the ol is a crucial factor for the stabilization of solitons against the supercritical collapse . in the normalized form",

    "note that the norm of stable solitons attains the largest value , which is @xmath67 , for @xmath66 ; with the growth of @xmath63 , the largest norm of the stable solitons decreases , which demonstrates the increasing difficulty in the stabilization of the solitons with the transition from the critical ( cubic ) to supercritical ( quintic ) nonlinearity in the 2d geometry . in accordance with this trend , all solitons in the pure quintic model ( the one without the cubic term ) are unstable ( as per the vk criterion ) , as the @xmath68 curve for the quintic model ( the dashed - dotted curve in fig .

    "solitons can also be found in finite bandgaps ; however , as well as in the 2d kp model with the self - repulsive @xmath19 term @xcite , all gap solitons turn out to be unstable .    as shown above , the supercritical collapse imposes an upper bound on the norm of stable fundamental solitons [ undoing rescalings leading to eq .",
    "( nls ) , one can conclude that the number of atoms in the respective matter - wave soliton is @xmath73 .",
