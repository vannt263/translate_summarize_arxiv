    "the covariance assignment problem was first explicitly described in  @xcite ; since then it has been extensively studied in the stochastic control literature , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for covariance assignment comes from the fact that many stochastic systems have performance goals that are expressed in terms of the variances ( or covariance matrix ) of the system states .",
    "so by assigning an appropriate matrix value to the system state covariance , desired performance goals could be achieved .",
    "the theory of covariance assignment has applications in model reduction , system identification , and state estimation .",
    "an analogous idea of covariance assignment has recently been used in the context of quantum systems for the generation of pure gaussian states  @xcite .",
    "a pure state is a state about which we can have the maximum amount of knowledge allowed by quantum mechanics .",
    "pure gaussian states are key resources for continuous - variable quantum information processing and quantum computation  @xcite . a gaussian state ( with zero mean ) is completely specified by its covariance matrix",
    "mathematically , an @xmath0-mode gaussian state is pure if and only if its covariance matrix @xmath1 meets @xmath2 .",
    "the generation of a zero - mean pure gaussian state is in fact a covariance assignment problem where the goal is to construct a linear quantum system that is asymptotically stable and achieves a steady - state covariance matrix corresponding to a desired pure gaussian state . unlike the classical covariance assignment problem , which typically involves designing feedback controllers ,",
    "pure gaussian states may be generated via synthesis of a linear quantum system that achieves an assigned covariance matrix , without using any explicit feedback control .",
    "it was shown in references  @xcite that given any pure gaussian state , a linear quantum system can be designed to achieve the covariance matrix corresponding to this pure gaussian state .",
    "furthermore , parametrizations of the system hamiltonian @xmath3 and the dissipation @xmath4 were also developed for the system ; see  @xcite for details . according to this result , for most pure gaussian states , linear quantum systems that generate pure gaussian states might have a complex structure that is difficult to realize in practice .",
    "that is , the system hamiltonian @xmath3 may have too many couplings or the dissipation @xmath4 contains too many dissipative processes .",
    "thus , one would like to characterize the class of pure gaussian states that can be generated by a simple class of linear quantum systems .    in this paper , we impose some constraints on a linear quantum system to ensure that the resulting system is relatively easy to realize .",
    "the first constraint is imposed on the system hamiltonian @xmath3 ; we assume that the system hamiltonian @xmath3 is of the form @xmath5 , where each @xmath6 can be an arbitrary real number and @xmath7 are the position and momentum operators for the @xmath8th mode .",
    "this describes a collection of @xmath0 independent quantum harmonic oscillators . if we write the system hamiltonian @xmath3 as a quadratic form , i.e. , @xmath9 , where @xmath10^{\\top}$ ] and @xmath11 , we will find that @xmath12 is a diagonal matrix , describing a passive system hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "another constraint is imposed on the dissipation @xmath4 ; we assume that the system is only coupled to a single designed dissipative environment . under the constraints above",
    ", the resulting linear quantum system will be relatively easy to implement in practice .",
    "we then parametrize the class of pure gaussian states that can be generated by this particular type of linear quantum system .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ preliminaries ] , we define the linear quantum systems under consideration",
    ". then we review some relevant properties of pure gaussian states and recall some recent results on covariance assignment corresponding to pure gaussian states . in section  [ constraints ] , we give the system constraints explicitly .",
    "we also explain their physical meanings . in section  [ characterization ] , we parametrize the class of pure gaussian states that can be generated by linear quantum systems subject to the constraints described in section  [ constraints ] . in section",
    "[ example ] , we provide three examples to illustrate the main results . in these examples , we also consider the impact on the system of uncontrolled couplings to additional dissipative environments .",
