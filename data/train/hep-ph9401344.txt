    "the nontrivial ground state structure of qcd with gluon condensates at zero temperature @xcite has been generalised here to finite baryon densities with three quark flavour .",
    "we have here included the charge neutrality condition to obtain the equation of state for strange quark matter .",
    "the equation of state so obtained is seen to be stiffer than the perurbative equation of state .",
    "the gluon condensate appears to vanish for baryon density greater than a critical value .    to derive the equation of state we have however not included the effects of vacuum structure with quark condensates associated with chiral symmetry breaking , the reason for this being that the contribution of quark condensates to the energy density is expected to be small compared to that of the gluons .",
    "however inclusion of the same might throw a light on relationship between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we have applied the equation of state so obtained to study structural properties of quark stars .",
    "they seem to be larger and in general more massive than neutron stars or hybrid stars with masses being around @xmath186 to @xmath187 and radii around 15 to 17 kilometers .",
    "we may note that this is a reflection of a stiffer equation of state of strange quark matter as obtained here .",
