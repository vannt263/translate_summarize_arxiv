    "fossil galaxy systems are group and cluster mass objects characterized by extended , relaxed x - ray isophotes and an extreme magnitude gap in the bright end of the optical luminosity function of their member galaxies .",
    "typically , fossils are identified with the criteria of a halo luminosity of @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 and a first ranked galaxy more than 2 @xmath7-band magnitudes brighter than the second brightest galaxy within half the virial radius @xcite .",
    "fossil systems comprise 8 - 20 per cent of groups and clusters in the same x - ray luminosity regime @xcite , and thus determining the origin of the features characterizing these systems is important for understanding the nature and evolution of a significant fraction galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "the features of fossil systems seem to fulfil theoretical predictions that the milky way luminosity ( @xmath8 * ) galaxies in a group will merge into a central bright elliptical in less than a hubble time , but the time - scale for the cooling and collapse of the hot gas halo is longer @xcite . indeed the first fossil group discovered , rx j1340.6 + 4018 @xcite , appeared as a solitary bright elliptical located in the centre of a group - sized x - ray luminous halo .",
    "it was thought the central galaxy of this group was the final merger remnant of the former group galaxies , and hence this object was named a ` fossil group ' . since then , deeper observations have found this system to consist of galaxies other than the bright central galaxy ( bcg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and as a result the magnitude gap criterion of fossils has been established .",
    "the motivation for this criterion is that over time , an increasingly growing difference between the two brightest galaxies will form as a result of the merging of the most massive galaxies into a single bright central elliptical if no infall occurs .",
    "this formation scenario is well suited for group mass fossils where the velocity dispersion is low and the dynamical friction time - scale is short .    a number of objects meeting the fossil criteria have also been observed in the cluster mass regime as well @xcite .",
    "it is possible fossil clusters may form as the result of two systems merging , where one group has had its bright galaxies merge due to dynamical friction , and the other has comparatively fainter galaxies @xcite .",
    "should merging occur between systems with similarly bright galaxies , any previously existing magnitude gaps may become filled in .",
    "therefore , meeting the fossil criteria may only be a transitory phase in the evolution of a group or cluster @xcite .",
    "numerical and hydrodynamic simulations indicate the large magnitude gaps characterizing fossil groups and clusters are associated with an early formation time : fossil systems have been found to assemble more of their total dynamical mass than non - fossil systems at every redshift @xcite , where half the dynamical mass is assembled by @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "evidence that fossils have formed and evolved in a different manner than normal groups and clusters should then manifest in differences in their respective properties .    the bright central galaxy which dominates the optical output of fossil systems has a number of unique characteristics , although whether this demonstrates a clearly distinct formation scenario from non - fossil bcgs is still uncertain",
    ". the bcgs of fossils are more massive in both the stellar component and in total than the central ellipticals in non - fossil systems of the same halo mass @xcite .",
    "@xcite find fossil bcgs are consistent with the fundamental plane of non - fossil bcgs , but show lower velocity dispersions and higher effective radii when compared to non - fossil intermediate - mass elliptical bcgs of the same @xmath10-band luminosity .",
    "these results suggest the fossil bcg has experienced a merger history of early gas - rich dissipational mergers , followed by gas - poor dissipationless mergers later .    on the global scale ,",
    "the scaling relations of fossil systems remain a point of contention due to limited data and inhomogeneities between studies .",
    "* hereafter kpj07 ) performed a comprehensive analysis of a sample of group mass fossil systems and found their sample fell on the same @xmath11@xmath3 relation as non - fossils .",
    "however , the fossil groups were found to have offset @xmath11 and @xmath3 for a given optical luminosity @xmath12 or velocity dispersion @xmath13 when compared to normal groups , which was interpreted as an excess in the x - ray properties of fossil systems for their mass . in a comparable study , @xcite found similar deviations between fossils and non - fossils .",
    "this offset , however , was interpreted as fossils being underluminous in the optical which is supported by their large mass - to - light ratios .",
    "these features would not result from galaxy - galaxy merging in systems with normal luminosity functions , and thus this analysis calls into question the formation scenario commonly attributed to generating the characteristic large magnitude gap of fossil systems .",
    "later studies , such as @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g14 ) , find no difference in the @xmath11@xmath12 relation of fossil systems and non - fossils .",
    "even so , most recently @xcite present a sample of groups , one of which qualifies as a fossil , that lies above the @xmath11@xmath12 relation of non - fossil systems , reopening the debate on fossil system scaling relations .    in this paper",
    "we have undertaken an x - ray study of 10 candidate fossil systems , never previously studied with detailed pointed observations in the x - ray regime . using _",
    "suzaku _ data , we present the first measurements of intracluster medium ( icm ) temperatures , bolometric x - ray luminosities , and estimates of the @xmath14 masses of our systems .",

    "global optical luminosities of our fogo sample are measured in fogo iii and used to construct the global @xmath11@xmath12 relation which reveals no difference between the fossil and non - fossil fits .",
    "deep @xmath15-band observations and an extensive spectroscopic database were used to redetermine the magnitude gaps of the fogo sample and reclassify our fossil candidate catalogue in fogo iv ( * ? ? ?",

    "our sample of 10 observed galaxy groups and clusters was selected from the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s07 ) catalogue of candidate fossil systems .",
    "the catalogue was assembled by first identifying luminous @xmath2019 mag red galaxies in the luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) catalogue @xcite , and selecting only those galaxies associated with extended x - ray emission in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) .",
    "sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 5 was then used to spatially identify companion galaxies to these bright galaxies .",
    "group or cluster membership was assigned to galaxies identified within a radius of 0.5 @xmath21 mpc from one of the bright lrgs and with a redshift consistent with that of the lrg .",
    "while spectroscopic redshifts were used when available , galaxy membership was primarily determined using photometric redshifts .",
    "groups and clusters with more than a 2 @xmath15-band magnitude difference between the brightest and second brightest member galaxies within the fixed 0.5 @xmath21 mpc system radius were then selected , and those with an early - type bcg were identified as fossils .    observed the fossil candidate list with the nordic optical telescope , the isaac newton telescope , and the telescopio nazionale galileo to obtain deeper @xmath15-band images and spectroscopic redshifts for candidate group members allowing for improved system membership .",
    "additionally , the search radius for galaxy system members was extended to the virial radius of the system as calculated from the rass x - ray luminosity .",
