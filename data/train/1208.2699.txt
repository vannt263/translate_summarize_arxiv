    "since superconductivity was discovered in the layered perovskite @xmath0 in 1994  @xcite , there has been much speculation as to the nature of the superconducting order parameter .",

    "chiral superconductivity breaks time - reversal symmetry with order parameters describing cooper pairs with nonzero magnetic moments . for chiral @xmath5-wave superconductivity ,",
    "the time - reversal symmetry breaking triplet order parameter is _ c^_c^_-~k_x ik_y , corresponding to a nonzero angular momentum @xmath8 in the @xmath9-direction per cooper pair .",
    "apart from the intrinsic interest in observing and understanding such an unusual quantum state , the quest to find chiral @xmath5-wave superconductors has generated enormous interest since they have been predicted to harbour majorana bound states  @xcite , quasiparticles which are their own antiparticles and which may play an important role in quantum computation .",
    "one important feature of @xmath0 that can impact the nature of the possibly chiral order parameter is the fact that it is multiband  @xcite .",
    "three atomic orbitals dominate the electronic structure of @xmath0 close to the fermi surface : ru @xmath10 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 orbitals ( strongly hybridized with o @xmath5 orbitals ) .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 orbitals hybridize to form the quasi - one - dimensional @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands , while the @xmath10 orbital predominates the @xmath11 band , which has an approximately isotropic two - dimensional dispersion .",
    "spin - orbit coupling leads to some hybridization between the @xmath12 and @xmath10 orbitals , which otherwise would not hybridize  @xcite .",
    "importantly for @xmath0 , the fermi surface crosses all three of the bands resulting from this orbital structure .    where does superconductivity arise amongst these three bands ?",
    "the most widely - held viewpoint holds that superconductivity arises primarily on the @xmath11 band ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . a persistent contrarian position , however , maintains that superconductivity instead arises primarily on the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands  @xcite .",
    "the latter model has one very appealing feature insofar as it may give rise to negligible spontaneous supercurrents at sample edges  @xcite .",
    "such edge currents have been predicted to arise in one - band chiral @xmath5-wave superconductors  @xcite , but bafflingly , have never been observed  @xcite .",
    "( for a recent review of experimental probes of the order parameter in @xmath0 , see ref .",
    "non - topological chiral superconductivity on the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands could explain this .    amongst experiments purporting to show evidence for time - reversal symmetry breaking in @xmath0 , one of the most direct probes is the kerr rotation experiment carried out in the group of kapitulnik at stanford  @xcite . in this experiment , a near - infrared beam ( @xmath13ev )",

    "it is the point of this paper to expand on this idea and suggest ways for future experiments to make further progress in answering questions related to the nature of the order parameter .    on its own , time - reversal symmetry breaking is not sufficient to have a nonzero hall conductivity in the absence of an applied magnetic field and hence , a non - zero kerr angle . as pointed out by read and green  @xcite , for instance",
    ", the hall conductivity of a translationally - invariant chiral @xmath5-wave superconductor is identically zero  @xcite . since the publication of kapitulnik s group s data in 2006  @xcite",
    ", two credible mechanisms have emerged in which chiral @xmath5-wave superconductivity in @xmath0 can give rise to a nonzero anomalous hall conductivity .",
    "first , a purely extrinsic mechanism due to impurity scattering was suggested by goryo  @xcite and lutchyn _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",

    "( a previously identified intrinsic contribution from chiral p - wave collective modes  @xcite is estimated to be several orders of magnitude too small to explain the experiments  @xcite and will not be discussed here . )    very usefully for the questions identified above , the intrinsic mechanism gives rise to a nonzero anomalous hall conductivity if and only if there are multiple chiral order parameters spanning multiple optically active bands . for @xmath0 ,",
    "this means that there _ must _ be superconductivity on the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands in order for the intrinsic @xmath14 to be nonzero .",
    "in contrast , the extrinsic mechanism contributes as well when chiral superconductivity occurs on the @xmath11 band .",

    ", we suggest two ways in which experiments can deduce the relative importance of the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms . first , the intrinsic mechanism produces a very strong spectral feature in the frequency - dependent anomalous hall conductivity ( and kerr angle ) close to twice the inter - orbital @xmath18 hopping energy , near @xmath19ev .",
    "the detection of this feature , robust to temperature and impurity effects in clean samples of @xmath0 , would provide nearly unequivocal evidence in our opinion for strong superconductivity on the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands .",
    "second , by measuring the dependence of @xmath14 on the impurity concentration , knowing the dependence of the superconducting gap on this quantity as well , one could estimate the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions .",
    "following our earlier work  @xcite , we analyze a two - orbital model in order to make clear the physics of the anomalous hall conductivity in a multiband superconductor at finite temperatures .",
    "we will use this model later to describe the physics of @xmath0 since , although three orbitals are needed to account for the fermi surface properties  @xcite , only two orbitals  the ru @xmath1 and @xmath2 ones  are directly relevant for the hall conductivity .",

    "in particular , the sharp features emerging due to the van hove singularities near the minimum of @xmath43 ( see figs .",
    "[ sigmaomegateq0fig ] and [ sigmaomegateq1pt4fig ] ) will not be appreciably smoothed out at nonzero temperatures .",
    "this is because , relative to @xmath78 , the temperature , @xmath79 , is always very small in the superconducting phase where the anomalous hall effect arises .",

    "the van hove singularities represent a resonance condition for these transitions . in this way , the detection of a strong increase in the hall conductivity at frequencies on the order of the inter - orbital hopping energy would provide strong evidence in favour of multiband / multiorbital cooper pairing in a chiral superconductor , such as has been proposed in @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , features in the hall conductivity arising at frequencies on the order of the gap , such as impurity scattering contributions which yield a nonzero hall conductivity in a single band system  @xcite , are comparatively insensitive to whether or not superconductivity is a multiband phenomenon .",

    "consequently , the conclusions reached from our two orbital model are still valid .",
    "in particular , the intrinsic , anomalous hall effect in @xmath0 is only nonzero when there is complex inter - band pairing and this pairing must involve the @xmath1 and @xmath2 orbitals to a significant extent .",
    "higher order spin - orbit coupling , of order @xmath87 ( where @xmath88 is the spin - orbit coupling parameter ; see e.g. ref .",

    "this reduction is offset somewhat by the larger value of @xmath177 ( where @xmath178k ) used in the present work as a result of solving the bcs gap equation appropriate for our model , instead of using the @xmath115-wave bcs result @xmath179    although the kerr angle is additionally very sensitive to the low - temperature optical properties of @xmath0 , and more information about these are needed to reliably make contact with experiment , there are a few ways in which experiments should be able to distinguish between the two contributions  extrinsic  @xcite and intrinsic  to the hall conductivity identified by theory .",
    "first , as we have noted in this paper , the intrinsic mechanism will exhibit a strong frequency dependence in the vicinity of twice the inter - orbital hopping , around 40 mevs .",
    "unfortunately , this seems to be outside the range of the current experimental setup at stanford  @xcite .",
    "secondly , experiments could probe the dependence of the kerr angle on the impurity concentration .    to a good approximation ,",
    "the intrinsic mechanism discussed here leads to a hall conductivity that depends on the impurity concentration only through its approximately quadratic dependence on the order parameter , eq .",
    "( [ propid ] ) . in turn , the impurity dependence of @xmath68 , and hence , @xmath101 , has been studied  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the extrinsic contribution to the hall conductivity  @xcite will exhibit an additional , stronger dependence on the impurity concentration .    in summary , a more detailed understanding of the anomalous hall conductivity in @xmath0 ,",
    "either by probing its frequency dependence or its dependence on the concentration of non - magnetic impurities , would contribute significantly to understanding this material .",
    "in particular , the hall conductivity is sensitive to the way in which the different bands crossing the fermi energy of @xmath0 enter into the chiral @xmath5-wave order parameter .",
