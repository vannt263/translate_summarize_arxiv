    "the no - slip boundary condition is known to be valid for many continuum scale problems . however , in some cases , such as spreading of fluid on a solid surface @xcite , corner flow @xcite and extrusion of polymer melts from capillary tubes @xcite , assuming no - slip at the boundary leads to velocity and stress singularities , and the breakdown of the no - slip boundary condition . while steady flow boundary conditions for simple regular interfaces are fairly well understood ,",
