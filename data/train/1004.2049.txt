    "the cosmic electromagnetic backgrounds at most of these frequencies  ) radiation is easily absorbed by neutral hydrogen , euv has been detected from agns and galaxy clusters at wavelengths of @xmath9 ( see the euv review by @xcite ) .",
    "closer to the lyman limit , not even a galactic background has been detected yet @xcite , and the galactic neutral hydrogen would much more effectively block incoming euv radiation .",
    "however , the extragalactic ionizing background at a variety of redshifts is indirectly measured by the ionization state of lyman-@xmath2 forest clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . ]",
    "have now been measured ( as reviewed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "searches are underway for very - high energy photons , including those with pev @xcite and even eev energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these searches face several challenges . at pev energies ,",
    "extragalactic searches are hampered by @xmath10 opacity , in which pev photons interact with the cmb to produce @xmath11 pairs , and the universe is highly opaque at these energies @xcite .",
    "eev photons are predicted to exist ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the universe is possibly transparent to several mpc at these energies @xcite , but very low number statistics are a problem . finally , above @xmath12 ,",
    "the galaxy becomes completely opaque , as single photons pair produce @xmath11 off the galactic magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the only other frontier in terms of photon energy is at the other end of the electromagnetic spectrum , the lowest frequency radio waves .",
    "the universe is filled with tenuous plasma , the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , which prevents radio propagation below the plasma frequency @xmath13 .",
    "waves below this frequency evanesce within one wavelength , reflecting off the medium .",
    "the mean baryonic density of the universe is @xmath14 , although regions in the igm may have higher or lower densities .",
    "for igm with electron density @xmath15 , the plasma frequency is @xmath16 the density distribution in the universe can be approximated as a lognormal distribution , with most of the volume being relatively empty @xcite .",
    "roughly @xmath17 of the universe s volume at @xmath18 is predicted to have @xmath19 @xcite , which corresponds to a plasma frequency of @xmath20 .",
    "this is essentially the low end of the cosmic electromagnetic spectrum , below which no electromagnetic wave can ever travel .",
    "although there might be electromagnetic radiation with @xmath21 in the universe , direct observations at these frequencies are impossible .",
    "observations down to @xmath22 will soon be routine with lofar @xcite .",
    "however , the earth s ionosphere has a typical plasma frequency of @xmath22 , depending on the time of day and other conditions .",
    "similarly , the moon may have an ionosphere with a plasma frequency of a few hundred khz , which sets a lower limit to the frequency of lunar - based observatories @xcite .",
    "satellites have measured the galactic radio emission down to @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "space - based observatories near the earth , such as the proposed alfa @xcite , can potentially observe down to @xmath24 , which is the plasma frequency of the solar wind at earth s orbit .",
    "further out from the sun , the plasma frequency continues to drop , and the _ voyager _",
    "probes took advantage of this to detect khz emission @xcite .",
    "however , the interstellar medium itself has a plasma frequency of 2 khz , which serves as a hard limit for direct observations of galactic and extragalactic sources .",
    "the situation is even worse for extragalactic and distant galactic sources . the warm ionized medium ( wim )",
    "forms a disc with scale height @xmath25 and a typical density of @xmath26 .",
    "the wim is opaque to low frequency radio emission because of free - free absorption .",
    "although this absorption has uses for tomography of the galactic ism @xcite , it prevents all direct extragalactic observations at @xmath27 .",
    "there may be a few low density ` chimneys ' that allow in some lower frequency radio emission @xcite , but for practical purposes , the extragalactic sky at the lowest radio frequencies will be shrouded from our direct view for the foreseeable future .",
    "but there are ways around this limit to locate or place bounds on _ extragalactic _ sub - mhz radio sources .",
    "free - free absorption and other opacity sources become more effective at low frequency ; this is why they prevent sub - mhz radiation from reaching earth . yet",
    ", this also means that the lowest frequency radio waves are tightly coupled with the matter in the universe .",
    "observations of intergalactic matter therefore constrain these radio waves .",
    "synchrotron absorption and inverse compton scattering also place bounds on sub - mhz radio in regions with cosmic rays and magnetic fields , like galaxy clusters .",
    "i will argue that sub - mhz radio emission does not need to reach us , because _ the universe is our detector_.    i will first discuss our expectations for the sub - mhz sky (   [ sec : submhzsky ] ) , including postulated sub - mhz radio sources (   [ sec : submhzsources ] ) , the igm phases that can interact with sub - mhz radio waves (   [ sec : igmphases ] ) , and sub - mhz radio propagation through the igm (   [ sec : igmpropagation ] ) .",
    "i then set new limits on the extragalactic background at sub - mhz frequencies .",
    "the first limit i consider is the weak bound from the expansion history of the universe (   [ sec : omegar ] ) .",
    "the second bound is from the heating of the igm by free - free absorption of sub - mhz radio waves (   [ sec : ffabsorption ] ) .",
    "a third bound on incident radiation at the lowest frequencies comes from the radiation force exerted on igm clouds (   [ sec : cloudcrush ] ) .",
    "two more bounds can be set for clusters with cosmic rays : bounds on synchrotron heating by low frequency radio waves (   [ sec : synchheat ] ) and bounds on inverse compton upscattered radio waves (   [ sec : icbound ] ) .",
    "finally , if extragalactic photons with energy @xmath28 are ever detected , they will set extremely strong limits on the khz to mhz radio background (   [ sec : uhelimits ] ) .",
    "my goal throughout this paper is to derive upper bounds on the sub - mhz emission with order of magnitude accuracy , where possible with current knowledge . in some cases",
    "even this is not possible  the radio scattering properties of the igm over large distances are not well known , and this is a huge source of uncertainty in arguments that rely on radiative transfer .",
    "future theoretical work may reduce these uncertainties . throughout this work ,",
    "i consider the time - averaged sub - mhz background at @xmath29 , though these methods may be applied to other redshifts .",
    "the mhz to ghz radio emission of galaxies and some galaxy clusters is dominated by synchrotron emission from cosmic ray ( cr ) electrons and positrons ( @xcite reviews the synchrotron radio emission of non - agn galaxies , while @xcite reviews the synchrotron radio emission of galaxy clusters ) .",
    "this emission should continue down to lower frequencies , where mostly lower energy electrons and positrons are radiating .",
    "non - relativistic electrons and positrons emit at the cyclotron frequency @xmath30 at ghz wavelengths , the radio spectrum falls off steeply as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 for galaxies and @xmath33 for clusters , implying greater spectral densities at low frequency and greater power at low frequency for clusters .    however , the radio spectra of galaxies are unlikely to continue down to the sub - mhz range for a number of reasons .",
    "first , cr spectra tend to be flattened at low energies , because of escape , ionization , or bremsstrahlung losses , or simply because the low energy cr electrons are not old enough to be cooled by synchrotron emission .",
    "second , free - free absorption will prevent sub - mhz radiation from escaping galaxies , just as it prevents it from entering the galaxy .",
    "third , at the razin frequency , the index of refraction of the plasma the crs traverse suppresses the relativistic beaming of synchrotron emission . below the razin frequency",
    ", the synchrotron spectrum falls off precipitously . in the galaxy , the razin frequency is @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite calculated the khz to ghz radio background , including synchrotron emission . in terms of energy density",
    ", the spectrum falls off at frequencies below about a mhz .",
    "the prospects for strong sub - mhz synchrotron radiation from clusters are a bit more encouraging .",
    "galaxy clusters have much lower densities than galaxies , so bremsstrahlung and ionization losses are weaker .",
    "the low density and high hot temperature of the gas that fills clusters also means that free - free absorption will be much less effective at blocking sub - mhz radio emission ( discussed further in   [ sec : igmpropagation ] ) .",
    "finally , the low density means that the razin frequency will be much lower . for typical galaxy cluster densities and magnetic field strengths ,",
    "the razin cutoff is @xcite @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we may expect that synchrotron emission in clusters may extend all the way down to khz frequencies .",
    "in addition , there can be low frequency synchrotron emission from more diffuse structures .",
    "there appear to be radio structures associated with poor galaxy groups or filaments of galaxies @xcite .",
    "shocks from large scale structure formation are also predicted to produce low frequency radio emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "synchrotron emission is expected to have a brightness temperature limited to @xmath38 , because of inverse compton scattering by the synchrotron emitting particles among other concerns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this would imply a low energy density of synchrotron radio emission at low frequencies , @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "this limit only applies to steady - state sources ; transients can have much greater brightness temperatures .",
    "a number of plasma processes generate low frequency radio emission .",
    "these processes are often coherent and can evade the @xmath42 limit on incoherent synchrotron emission . many of these processes are observed in the sun ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the solar system .",
    "langmuir waves in plasma can be converted into radio emission near the plasma frequency and its first harmonic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "_ voyager _ has detected 1  4 khz radio emission @xcite , now known to be emitted somewhere near the heliopause @xcite . since its frequency is comparable to the plasma frequency of the ism and the solar wind at the heliopause , it is generally believed to be powered by langmuir wave conversion ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "coherent plasma processes have been suggested to generate radio emission in agns , but it is not clear that coherent emission can escape from the agns @xcite .    when the cyclotron frequency ( eq .  [ eqn : nub ] ) exceeds the plasma frequency ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : nup ] ) , and when the electron velocity distribution function grows with perpendicular velocity , the cyclotron maser instability can also generate bright radio emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cyclotron maser mechanism is believed to be the main source of jupiter s bright decametric radio emission @xcite and earth",
    "s auroral kilometric radiation @xcite , and may operate around exoplanets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the cyclotron maser is also believed to operate in stars , being responsible for the sun s microwave spike bursts and stellar radio bursts @xcite , and coherent periodic radio emission from brown dwarfs , though at higher frequencies @xcite .",
    "the same cosmic rays that produce the bulk of the synchrotron emission can also produce radiation by interacting with plasma .",
    "electrons travelling through an inhomogeneous plasma can emit transition radiation below the razin frequency , caused by a varying index of refraction @xcite .",
    "transition radiation is expected to be the main source of galactic emission below @xmath43 @xcite .      _ pulsar waves _ ",
    "pulsars are expected to generate magnetic dipole radiation of enormous amplitude as they spin down @xcite .",
    "the pulsar wave would have a frequency equal to the pulsar spin frequency , which would be less than a khz for a millisecond pulsar ( msp ) and @xmath44 for the crab pulsar .",
    "however , the environment around pulsars is expected to be filled with dense plasma , which might prevent the escape of these pulsar wave into intergalactic space @xcite .",
    "there are roughly 40000 msps in the galactic disc ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and 1000 in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "assuming they have an average luminosity of @xmath45 , each lasting 10 gyr @xcite , and scaling from the stellar mass of the milky way ( @xmath46 ; @xcite ) to total stellar mass of the local universe ( @xmath47 ; @xcite ) , msps can provide a maximum energy density of @xmath48 from galactic discs and @xmath49 from globular clusters .",
    "young pulsars are born at approximately the supernova rate , or @xmath50 for milky way - like galaxies , and have a spin energy of @xmath51 , yielding a maximum @xmath44 background of @xmath52 .",
    "the young pulsars and msps in the galactic discs are unlikely to contribute to the extragalactic background , however , because of free - free absorption in the galactic discs and the interstellar plasma frequency is often above 1 khz",
    ". some pulsars may contribute if they are kicked out of their galactic disc during the supernova .",
    "most likely , intergalactic absorption will reduce the energy densities further from these maximum estimates , so these energy densities are upper limits .",
    "_ conversion of gravitational waves _ ",
    "possibly one of the most exciting sources of low frequency radio waves would be gravitational waves ( gws ) .",
    "typical sources of gravitational waves have frequencies of less than about a kilohertz .",
    "@xcite showed that if they passed through a magnetized plasma , they can generate radio waves of the same frequency .",
    "even if non - linear plasma effects generate radio waves of higher frequency , the resulting frequency can still be below mhz @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves can also excite cyclotron resonances @xcite .",
    "black hole ringdown is predicted to be an important source of these converted gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "ligo s frequency range ( @xmath53 ) is above the plasma frequency of several igm phases , meaning that sources detectable by ligo may excite radio waves .",
    "these sources can include compact object mergers and cosmic strings .",
    "transients like merging stellar - mass black holes will produce bursts of gravitational waves .",
    "the cosmic energy density in gravitational waves is roughly @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the rate of observed gravity wave bursts , @xmath56 is the duration of the burst , and @xmath57 is the gravitational wave energy density within the burst itself .",
    "this can be evaluated approximately as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the strain at earth .",
    "ligo has constrained the rate of @xmath60 bursts with @xmath61 to be @xmath62 @xcite , implying that the cosmic energy density of bright gravitational wave bursts is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "an associated radio background is likely to have a much smaller energy density , because only a small fraction of the gravitational waves is converted into radio and because intergalactic absorption will convert the radio background into heat .",
    "however , faint gravitational wave bursts are not as well constrained by ligo .",
    "ligo has also constrained the @xmath66 stochastic gravitational wave background ( sgwb ) to have @xmath67 , assuming they have a power law spectrum , which should apply to cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "again , any related radio background would probably have a much lower energy density , especially considering intergalactic absorption .",
    "gravitational waves detectable by lisa , such as those from supermassive black hole mergers , will be below the plasma frequency of any reasonable density medium",
    ". they will be detectable only if they excite radio waves of much higher frequency .",
    "the phases of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) are believed to fall into three main categories : a low density ( @xmath68 ) , relatively cold ( @xmath69 ) photoionized phase visible as the lyman @xmath2 forest ; a denser , ( @xmath70 ) collisionally ionized phase that is hotter ( @xmath71 ) , known as the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) ; and condensed structures ( @xmath72 ) associated with galaxies and clusters @xcite .",
    "since each of these phases have different temperatures and densities , they interact with radio waves in different ways , with different absorption properties and thermal contents .",
    "i shall consider the effects that a sub - mhz background would have on these igm phases .",
    "a large enough background would alter the properties of these phases , and would indirectly be in conflict with observation .",
    "i now discuss the phases i will be considering in further detail ( properties summarised in table [ table : igmsummary ] ) :    * _ the lyman-@xmath2 forest _ : the lyman-@xmath2 forest is detected as weak lyman-@xmath2 absorption lines ( by definition @xmath73 , but typically @xmath74 ) in the spectra of bright background objects , such as quasars .",
    "the lyman-@xmath2 forest is particularly prominent at @xmath75 , where it dominates the baryonic content of the universe .",

    "_ warm - hot intergalactic medium _",
    ": the whim is one of the more elusive phases of the igm , despite being presumed to contain about @xmath82 of the baryonic content of the universe at @xmath18 ( see the review by @xcite ; also see @xcite ) .",
    "its presence is none the less inferred from uv and x - ray absorption lines of highly ionized species , such as collisionally ionized o vi absorbers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the whim is believed to be associated with structure formation ; as gas gravitationally collapses to form large - scale structure , it is shocked and heats up @xcite .",

    "_ cluster gas _ : an extremely hot ( @xmath88 ) phase of gas pervades galaxy clusters , and is easily visible in free - free x - ray emission .",

    "i consider strong mg ii absorbers with @xmath97 and @xmath98 with @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "weak metal line absorbers are also present around smaller , dwarf galaxies @xcite , and possibly in intergalactic space .",
    "photoionized weak metal - line absorbers include dense structures with @xmath100 and @xmath101 , detected in low ionization lines like mg ii and fe ii ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; kiloparsec - scale structures with @xmath102 that are observed in c iv at @xmath103 and mg ii at @xmath29 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; and possibly high - ionization absorbers with @xmath104 and @xmath105 seen in high ionization lines , such as c iv haloes at @xmath29 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and intergalactic o vi clouds at @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "i consider examples of all these structures , with a typical photoionized temperature of @xmath106 .",
    "these phases span a wide range of density , temperature , and locations near structures ; from lyman @xmath2 clouds that often appear in voids , to metal line absorbers that are concentrated very near galaxies .",
    "however , most of the volume of the universe is filled with voids with extremely low density gas ( @xmath107 ) . thus , if there was sub - mhz radio that somehow filled _ only _ voids , then it may not have a great effect on detected igm phases .",
    "even though there are some lyman-@xmath2 clouds in voids , they would have a plasma frequency greater than the background igm ; thus they would reflect incident radio waves of the lowest frequencies rather than being directly heated by them .",
    "even so , the pressure exerted by the exterior radiation background on the cloud could still have an effect if it was too high .",
    "[ table : igmsummary ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : bigfigkey ] + the pev @xmath108-ray limits do not correct for pair - production absorption from the cmb .",
    "+    low frequency radio waves can heat the igm through free - free absorption .",
    "observations of the igm thermal state constrain the amount of heating from the extragalactic sub - mhz radio background . free - free absorption bounds (   [ sec : ffubound ] ) are potentially the strongest of all of the limits , but are highly model dependent at low frequencies .",
    "if we are considering a radio bath that pervades the entire cloud evenly ( _ dashed red lines _ ) , then the entire cloud is heated up and the bounds are very strong at low frequency in terms of energy density .",
    "in fact , the energy density constraints within the lyman-@xmath2 forest just above its plasma frequency would be the strongest of any photon energy , as seen in figure  [ fig : embackgrounds ] .",
    "if a background was simply incident on the igm clouds , then when the cloud becomes optically thick , the outside of the cloud will be heated but the interior will not . in this case , if there is no scattering of radio waves within the cloud ( _ solid red lines , light pink shading _ ) , the clouds usually remain optically thin down to sub - khz frequency , and the energy density bounds remain strong . however , scattering will increase the effective absorption optical depth . naively applying the scattering",
    "mean free path in equation  [ eqn : mfpscattering ] considerably weakens the energy density bounds ( _ dotted red lines , darker pink shading _ ) .",
    "however , the approximations in equation  [ eqn : mfpscattering ] may break down at high scattering optical depth ( [ sec : igmpropagation ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "i have also not considered the opacity of any remaining shell of ` evaporated ' material around an optically thick cloud . in order to set firm limits from free - free absorption , we need to understand the radiative transfer of sub - mhz radio waves through the igm better .",
    "i have also set an upper limit on the luminosity density _ within _ each igm phase from free - free absorption (   [ sec : ffepsilonbound ] ) , assuming the radio waves fill the igm cloud evenly . from the existence and temperature of the lyman-@xmath2 forest ,",
    "i infer that at frequencies of @xmath109 hz , these clouds have a maximum emissivity of @xmath3 .",
    "again , a better understanding of the radiative transfer and the scattering in particular of sub - mhz radio waves is needed to set more firm limits on the luminosity density of the universe at low frequencies .    at the lowest frequencies ,",
    "there is a window in the free - free absorption constraints .",
    "this is because voids are extremely underdense , with a very low plasma frequency .",
    "sub - hz radio could be generated in the voids and would simply reflect off the more condensed structures that would otherwise be heated by them .",
    "free - free absorption constraints are weak because scattering or absorption of the radio waves shields the interior of each igm cloud . at the very lowest frequencies , below the plasma frequency of the cloud ,",
    "the radio waves simply reflect off it .",
    "there are none the less constraints even at these lowest frequencies , because the reflection , scattering , or absorption of these waves squeezes igm clouds (   [ sec : cloudcrush ] ) .",
    "these radiation pressure bounds ( figure  [ fig : embackgrounds ] , _ brown _ ) are somewhat weak but are still strong enough to rule out an average sub - hz background as large as the starlight backgrounds . unlike the free - free absorption bounds , the maximum @xmath110 are not model dependent .",
    "however , the frequency range over which they are applicable also depends on the radio scattering properties of the igm . at the very least",
    ", the radiation pressure bounds apply until the cloud is optically thin to free - free absorption .",
    "galaxy clusters have hot and dense gas , which makes them poor free - free absorption detectors for any sub - mhz radio waves within them .",
    "however , they also contain magnetic fields and cosmic rays , which can interact with sub - mhz radio waves in additional ways and provide additional limits ( figure  [ fig : clusterlimits ] ) .",
    "low frequency radio waves above the razin frequency ( @xmath111 ) can actually heat cr electrons / positrons , and would create a peak into the observed mhz to ghz synchrotron radio spectra of clusters (   [ sec : synchheat ] ) .",
    "the lack of such a peak rules out sub - mhz radio backgrounds as small as @xmath112 in the coma cluster , comparable to the energy density in starlight .",
    "cr electrons / positrons can also inverse compton scatter low frequency radio waves to observable mhz to ghz frequencies (   [ sec : icbound ] ) .",
    "the observed radio spectrum again constrains the sub - mhz radio background in coma to be as small as @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "some relatively weak statements can be made about whether the backgrounds described in   [ sec : submhzsources ] exist .",
    "the most exotic sources of sub - mhz radio waves are constrained . the radiation pressure bound from weak mg ii",
    "/ c iv absorbers are sufficiently strong to exclude a radio background as large as the ligo upper limits on a 100 hz stochastic gravitational wave background .",
    "a background of pulsar waves , if they somehow escaped into the igm and did not suffer absorption , would be weaker still ; the free - free absorption bounds without scattering are strong enough to rule out such backgrounds from all young pulsars and all msps in galactic discs .",
    "these maximum estimates of the sub - mhz radio background are probably unrealistic anyway ( see the discussion in   [ sec : exoticsources ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , a more realistic synchrotron background also seems to be out of reach by the free - free absorption bounds ; a @xmath114 background is ruled out only for @xmath115 , which can already be directly observed . however , if the scattering properties of the igm are similar to those in the ism , such that eq .",
    "[ eqn : mfpscattering ] holds , then the radiation pressure bounds from the lyman-@xmath2 forest will rule out maximal synchrotron backgrounds at @xmath23 .",
    "there are several ways to reduce the uncertainties in these bounds .",
    "knowledge of the low frequency scattering properties of the igm is essential for the free - free absorption bounds , which would otherwise be strong ( _ solid red lines _ in figure  [ fig : embackgrounds ] ) .",
    "this knowledge can also help us determine the frequency range the radiation pressure bounds apply over .",
    "strong scattering will _ weaken _ the free - free absorption bounds , because radiation can not diffuse deep into the cloud and heat it ; but strong scattering _ strengthens _ the radiation pressure bounds , because radiation can then efficiently couple with the cloud exterior and squeeze it .",
    "low frequency radio observations of galaxy clusters and other environments with crs are especially useful for the inverse compton and synchrotron heating bounds . observations of extragalactic ultra high energy photons , if they exist , would set extremely strong constraints on the extragalactic sub - mhz background (   [ sec : uhelimits ] ) , especially at high frequencies where the other bounds are weakest",
    ".    it would be a simple matter to apply similar constraints to sub - mhz emission within the galaxy itself , which will be done in a future paper .",
    "not only are the thermal properties of the interstellar medium relatively well characterised , but the galaxy has a well known cr electron spectrum and magnetic field .",
    "therefore , we could apply synchrotron heating and ic upscattering arguments , which are not dependent on the scattering of low frequency radio waves .",
    "this would allow us to probe distant regions of the galaxy that are not visible at low radio frequencies because of free - free absorption , such as the galactic centre , which is obscured by free - free absorption at frequencies as high as 330 mhz ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although the bounds in this paper may not strongly constrain expected sources like a synchrotron background , the extragalactic sub - mhz sky is not _",
    "completely _ unknowable . instead of disregarding the low frequency emission of radio sources",
    ", it is possible to consider the effects of the emission on their surroundings .",
    "these effects may prove to be important to our understanding of the regions around sub - mhz sources .",
    "even if the extragalactic sub - mhz sky is forever invisible to us directly , its presence can still be seen .",

    "<S> the galactic disc is opaque to radio waves from extragalactic sources with frequencies @xmath0 less than @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , radio waves with khz , hz , and even lower frequencies may propagate through the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . </S>",
    "<S> i argue that the presence of these waves can be inferred by using the universe as our detector . </S>",
    "<S> i discuss possible sub - mhz sources and set new non - trivial upper limits on the energy density of sub - mhz radio waves in galaxy clusters and the average cosmic background . </S>",
    "<S> limits based on five effects are considered : ( 1 ) changes in the expansion of the universe from the radiation energy density ( 2 ) heating of the igm by free - free absorption ; ( 3 ) radiation pressure squeezing of igm clouds by external radio waves ; ( 4 ) synchrotron heating of electrons in clusters ; and ( 5 ) inverse compton upscattering of sub - mhz radio photons . </S>",
    "<S> any sub - mhz background must have an energy density much smaller than the cmb at frequencies below 1 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the free - free absorption bounds from the lyman-@xmath2 forest are potentially the strongest , but are highly dependent on the properties of sub - mhz radio scattering in the igm . </S>",
    "<S> i estimate an upper limit of @xmath3 for the emissivity within lyman-@xmath2 forest clouds in the frequency range @xmath4 hz . </S>",
    "<S> the sub - mhz energy density in the coma cluster is constrained to be less than @xmath5 . at present , none of the limits is strong enough to rule out a maximal @xmath6 sub - mhz synchrotron background , but other sources may be constrained with a better knowledge of sub - mhz radio propagation in the igm .    </S>",
