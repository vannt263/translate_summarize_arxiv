    "the analysis of correlations and entanglement in interacting quantum many body systems has attracted strong attention in recent years @xcite , motivated by their deep implications for quantum information processing and transmission @xcite , the impressive advances in techniques for controlling and measuring quantum systems @xcite and the new perspective they provide for the analysis of quantum phase transitions @xcite . while the conventional mean field ( mf ) approximations",
    "@xcite provide a basic starting point for studying such systems over a broad range of the pertinent control parameters , they are not directly suitable for the description of entanglement , since they are based on completely factorized states .",
    "more sophisticated treatments have been developed to include and compute quantum correlations , like for instance density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) techniques @xcite , matrix product states and tensor network methods @xcite , variational valence bond based approximations @xcite , quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite , and inclusion of static and quantum fluctuations around mf @xcite .",
    "in addition , non - conventional mf approaches , able to intrinsically include some essential correlations , have also been proposed and recently improved and revisited @xcite , which start from the so - called cluster mf approach , also known as bpw ( bethe - peierls - weiss ) approximation @xcite .",
    "the essential point in these schemes is the consideration of composite sites containing more than one `` body '' as the basic independent units .",
    "their application to specific spin systems @xcite has shown their capability for determining phase diagrams and critical temperatures , as well as for describing the main features of observables such as magnetization and susceptibility . their ability to predict entanglement measures",
    "has so far not been investigated .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate a general self - consistent variational mf treatment , based on the selection of an arbitrary subset of operators for representing the system density matrix @xcite , and its potential for describing basic entanglement measures in spin systems .",
    "the approach can be applied at both zero or finite temperatures and contains as particular cases the conventional as well as the cluster - type mf approaches .",
    "in contrast with other variational treatments , the generalized mf scheme does not require an explicit ansatz for the approximate gs , as the latter is naturally determined by the self - consistency relations according to the chosen set of operators .",
    "the scheme may be also used as a convenient starting point for more sophisticated treatments .",
    "we will examine in particular its capability for describing entanglement , both within the defined units as well as between them , the latter emerging through symmetry restoration or perturbative corrections .    as a specific example , we will consider a pair mf approximation to the ground state ( gs ) of dimerized spin @xmath0 systems with anisotropic @xmath1 or @xmath2 couplings in a transverse field . in order to test its accuracy",
    ", we first examine the case of dimerized @xmath1 chains with first neighbor couplings , where the exact results for any size @xcite can be obtained through the jordan - wigner fermionization @xcite .",
    "we then examine dimerized chains with longer range couplings , dimer lattices and dimerized @xmath2 systems , where exact results for finite samples were obtained by numerical diagonalization .",
    "dimerized systems are of great interest in both condensed matter physics and quantum information @xcite , and can be realized in different ways , including recently cold atoms trapped in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "spin @xmath0 systems have the additional advantage of permitting a direct computation of the pairwise entanglement through the concurrence @xcite .    while conserving the conceptual simplicity of the conventional mf scheme",
    ", we will show that in contrast with the latter , the pair mf approach is able to provide a reliable yet still analytic and simple description of dimerized arrays .",
    "its phase diagram differs significantly from that of the conventional mf , and clearly identifies , for a wide range of systems , a fully dimerized phase for weak fields , a partially aligned phase for strong fields and an intermediate @xmath3-parity breaking degenerate phase",
    ". it then predicts , in particular , the two transitions exhibited by the gs of the dimerized @xmath1 chain for increasing fields @xcite , providing a clear approximate picture of the gs in each phase .",
    "the approach also leads to a reduced pair density which correctly describes not only the internal entanglement of the pair , but also ( through symmetry restoration ) its entanglement with the rest of the system , which shows a prominent peak precisely in the parity breaking sector . by means of simple perturbative corrections",
