    "2002 ) show near - complete absorption of flux at wavelengths short - ward of lyman-@xmath2 ( gunn & peterson 1965 ) , indicating that the universe is optically thick to this line , and that the neutral fraction of hydrogen is much greater than at lower redshifts .",
    "_ wmap _ results from the cosmic microwave background indicate that the universe was completely neutral at redshifts of @xmath6 ( spergel et al .",
    "there is an ongoing debate as to what reionized the universe at @xmath3 : is it agn or ionizing photons ( produced in hot , massive , short - lived stars ) escaping from star forming galaxies ?",
    "agn appear to be very under - abundant at these epochs ( e.g. , dijkstra , haiman & loeb 2004 ) , so to address the reionization issue it is crucial to know the global star formation rate at high redshifts , along with the escape fraction for these ionizing photons . in this review talk",
    "i will outline the work done in identifying star - forming galaxies within the first billion years of the big bang through deep imaging in the optical and near - infrared with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and spectroscopy with large telescopes from the ground .",
    "i will also discuss what can be learned about the stellar masses and formation epochs of these galaxies , and what role they may have played in the reionization of the universe .",
    "the standard `` concordance '' cosmology is used throughout ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and use @xmath9 ) .",
    "all magnitudes are on the @xmath10 system .",
    "to address the contribution of star - forming galaxies to reionization , we need to reliably identify galaxies at @xmath11 and measure their integrated rest - frame uv flux .",
    "magnitude - limited spectroscopic surveys have shown that the high - redshift tail is small , so simply taking spectra of everything in a deep field is an expensive way of discovering a handful of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "some way of isolating candidate high - redshift galaxies from the foreground population is required to provide targets for follow - up spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "one technique is to use narrow - band imaging to identify galaxies where highly - redshifted line emission falls within the passband .",
    "after many years of fruitless searches in the 1980s and early 1990s , this method is now yielding great results , although the lyman-@xmath2 line typically targetted is a poor measure of the star formation rate . in the past decade ,",
    "deep imaging in several different broad - bands ( typically spanning the optical and near - infrared ) has also been used to estimate the redshifts of galaxies on the basis of their observed colours  essentially using the few photometric datapoints at different wavelengths as a crude low - dispersion spectrum . in this article",
    "i will focus on a particular variant of these  photometric redshifts \" , which relies on a strong spectral break arising from absorption by neutral hydrogen in intervening clouds along the line of sight ( the lyman-@xmath2 forest ) .",
    "this `` lyman break technique '' was originally pioneered at @xmath12 by steidel and co - workers ( steidel , pettini & hamilton 1995 ; steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) who identified @xmath13-band drop - outs . at @xmath12",
    "the technique involves the use of three filters : the @xmath13-band below the lyman limit ( @xmath14 ) ; the @xmath15- or @xmath16-band in the lyman forest region and a third filter , the @xmath17-band , long - ward of the lyman-@xmath2 line ( @xmath18 ) . at @xmath0",
    ", we can efficiently use only two filters , above ( @xmath19-band 9000 ) and below ( @xmath1-band 8000 ) the continuum break at the lyman-@xmath2 line ( @xmath20 ) ; since the integrated optical depth of the lyman-@xmath2 forest at @xmath0 is @xmath21 ( see figure  1 ) , there is essentially no flux at shorter wavelengths , rendering the shortest - wavelength filter below the lyman limit redundant .",
    "the key issue is to work at a sufficiently - high signal - to - noise ratio that lyman break `` drop - out '' galaxies can be safely identified through detection in a single redder band ( i.e. , @xmath19-band ) .",
    "this approach has been demonstrated to be effective by the sdss collaboration in the detection of @xmath0 qsos using the @xmath1- and @xmath19-bands alone ( fan et al .",
    "2002 ) , using wide - area but shallow ground - based imaging , which is sensitive to bright but rare quasars .",
    "several deep imaging programmes with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on _ hst _ use the sharp - sided sdss f775w ( @xmath1 ) and f850lp ( @xmath19 ) filters , which can be used to locate the``@xmath22-drop '' candidate @xmath0 galaxies ( fainter but more numerous than the qsos ) . figures  1&2 illustrates how a colour cut of @xmath23 can be effective in selecting sources with @xmath24 .",
    "the acs images of the _ chandra _ deep field south from the _ hst _ treasury `` great observatory origins deep survey '' ( goods ; giavalisco & dickinson 2003 ) have been used to discover this @xmath1-drop population of @xmath0 galaxies ( stanway , bunker & mcmahon 2003 ; dickinson _ et al .  _ 2004 ; giavalisco _ et al .",

    "the relation between the flux density in the rest - uv around @xmath51  and the star formation rate ( @xmath52 in @xmath53 ) is given by @xmath54 from madau , pozzetti & dickinson ( 1998 ) for a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf with @xmath55 .",

    "a tantalizing result from our work so far is that at @xmath4 there are far fewer uv - luminous star forming galaxies than would have been predicted if there was no evolution , based on a comparison to the well - studied @xmath42 lyman break population ( steidel et al.1999 ) .",
    "in fact , the volume averaged ( comoving ) star formation rate in galaxies with @xmath60 is @xmath61 _ less _ at @xmath0 than at @xmath30 .",
    "so it would appear that at this crucial epoch , where abundant sources of uv photons are needed to reionize the universe , there is in fact a deficit of luminous star forming galaxies .",
    "the bright end of luminosity function has evolved greatly from @xmath4 to @xmath12 .",

    "at the relatively bright cut of @xmath56 used in stanway , bunker & mcmahon ( 2003 ) from the goodsv0.5 survey , the udf data is 98% complete for sources as extended as @xmath69arcsec .",
    "interestingly , we detect no extended ( low surface brightness ) @xmath1-drops to this magnitude limit in addition to the targetted @xmath1-drop sbm03#1 in the deeper udf data .",
    "this supports our assertion that the @xmath1-drop population is predominantly compact and there can not be a large completeness correction arising from extended objects ( c.f .",
    "lanzetta et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the acs imaging is of course picking out hii star forming regions , and these uv - bright knots of star formation are typically @xmath70kpc ( @xmath71arcsec at @xmath0 ) even within large galaxies at low redshift .",
    "it is interesting that the level of stellar contamination in the udf @xmath1-drops is only 2% , compared with about one in three at the bright end ( @xmath56 ; stanway , bunker & mcmahon 2003 ; stanway et al.2004 )",
    ". this may be because we are seeing through the galactic disk at these faint limiting magnitudes to a regime where there are no stars ( see also pirzkal et al .",
    "we compare our @xmath1-drop luminosity function with the work of madau , haardt & rees ( 1999 ) for the density of star formation required for reionization .",

    "@xmath74 is the concentration factor of neutral hydrogen , @xmath75 .",
    "simulations suggest @xmath76 ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "even if we take @xmath77 ( no absorption by h  i ) this estimate of the star formation density required is a factor of @xmath78 higher than our measured star formation density of @xmath66 at @xmath0 from galaxies in the udf with sfrs@xmath67 . for faint end slopes of @xmath79 galaxies with @xmath80 account for @xmath81% of the total luminosity , so would fall short of the required density of lyman continuum photons required to reionize the universe .",
    "if the faint - end slope is as steep as @xmath82 then there would just be enough uv lyman continuum photons generated in star forming galaxies at @xmath0 ( assuming a salpeter imf ) , but the required escape fraction for complete reionization would still have to be implausibly high ( @xmath83 , whereas all high-@xmath39 measurements to date indicate @xmath84 : fernnadez - soto , lanzetta & chen 2003 ; steidel , adelberger & pettini 2001 ) .",
    "if star forming galaxies at redshifts close to @xmath85 were responsible for the bulk of reionization , then a very different initial mass function would be required , or the calculations of the clumping factor of neutral gas would have to be significantly over - estimated ( see also stiavelli , fall & panagia 2004 ) . alternatively another low - luminosity population ( e.g. , forming globular clusters ; ricotti 2002 ) could be invoked to provide some of the shortfall in ionizing photons .",
    "it is also plausible that the bulk of reionization occurred at redshifts well beyond @xmath85 : the wmap polarization data indicate @xmath86 ( spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) , and it is possible that the gunn - peterson troughs seen in @xmath87 qsos ( becker et al .  2001 ; fan et al .",

    "measurements of the stellar masses of individual @xmath4 galaxies can also constrain structure formation paradigms ; in a simple hierarchical model , massive galaxies assemble at later times through merging , so it might be expected that in this scenario the number density of massive evolved galaxies in the first gyr would be low .    obtaining",
    "such observational evidence of old stars at high redshift is challenging : the initial work on @xmath4 galaxies was based on optical and near - infrared imaging and explored the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) in these galaxies , which is completely dominated by recent or ongoing star formation .",
