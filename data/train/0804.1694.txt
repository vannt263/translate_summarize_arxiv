    "in the last few years , there has been a surge of interest in modeling complex systems as networks or graphs , with nodes representing typical system units and edges playing the role of interactions between connected pairs of units .",
    "thus , complex networks have been used to model several types of real - life systems ( social , economic , biological , technological ) , and to study various processes taking place on them @xcite . in this context",
    ", some models of networks have been designed to explain empirical data in several fields , as is the case of the so - called small - world networks , introduced by watts and strogatz in 1998 @xcite .",
    "these small - world networks are well suited to study systems with underlying topological structure ranging from regular lattices to random graphs @xcite , by changing a single parameter @xcite .",
    "they are based on a regular lattice , in which a fraction @xmath0 of the links between nearest - neighbor sites are replaced by new random connections , creating long - range `` shortcuts '' @xcite . in the networks",
    "so generated one has at the same time a local neighborhood ( as in regular lattices ) and some global properties of random graphs , such as a small average topological distance between pairs of nodes .",
    "these networks are suitable to study different kinds of physical systems , as neural networks @xcite and man - made communication and transportation systems @xcite .",
    "the importance of a short global length scale has been emphasized for several statistical physical problems on small - world networks . among these problems ,",
    "one finds the spread of infections @xcite , signal propagation @xcite , random spreading of information @xcite , as well as site and bond percolation @xcite .",
    "cooperative phenomena in this kind of networks are expected to display unusual characteristics , associated to their peculiar topology @xcite .",
    "thus , a paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition of mean - field type was found for the ising model on small - world networks derived from one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattices @xcite .",
    "this phase transition occurs for any value of the rewiring probability @xmath7 , and the transition temperature @xmath1 increases as @xmath0 is raised .",
    "a similar mean - field - type phase transition was found in small - world networks generated from 2d and 3d regular lattices @xcite , as well as for the @xmath8 model in networks generated from one - dimensional chains @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the ising model has been thoroughly studied in complex networks , such as the so - called scale - free networks , where several unusual features were observed @xcite .",
    "here we study the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ising model in small - world networks generated by rewiring a 2d square lattice .",
    "one expects that the afm ordering present in the regular lattice at low temperature will be lost when random connections are introduced , for an increasing number of bonds will be frustrated as @xmath0 rises .",
    "in particular , this model includes the two basic ingredients necessary to have a spin glass ( sg ) , namely , disorder and frustration .",
    "the former appears due to the random long - range connections introduced in the rewiring process , and the latter because half of these rewired links connect sites located in the same sublattice of the starting regular lattice .    in some spin - glass models , such as the sherrington - kirkpatrick model , all spins are mutually connected @xcite .",
    "an intermediate step between these globally connected networks and finite - dimensional models consists in studying spin glasses on random graphs with finite ( low ) connectivity @xcite . a further step between random graphs with finite mean connectivity and regular lattices is provided by small - world networks , where one can modify the degree of disorder by changing the rewiring probability @xmath0 .",
    "then , for the afm ising model on small - world networks , we expect to find features close to those of short - range spin - glass systems . in this line ,",
    "a spin - glass phase has been recently found and characterized for the afm ising model in scale - free networks @xcite . in this paper , we employ monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to study the paramagnetic to spin - glass phase transition occurring in small - world networks .",
    "apart from temperature and system size , another variable is the rewiring probability , which controls the degree of disorder , and allows us to interpolate from a paramagnetic - afm transition at @xmath9 to a paramagnetic - sg transition in a random graph at @xmath10 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the networks and the computational method employed here . in sec.iii",
    "we give results for the heat capacity , energy , and spin correlation , as derived from mc simulations .",
    "in sec.iv we present and discuss the overlap parameter , transition temperature , and absence of long - range ordering .",
    "the paper closes with the conclusions in sec.v .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian : @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , and the coupling matrix @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 this means that each edge in the network is an afm interaction between spins on the two linked nodes .",
    "note that , contrary to the usually studied models for spin glasses , in this model all couplings are antiferromagnetic .",
    "this model with afm couplings can be mapped onto one in which all unrewired bonds are ferromagnetic ( fm ) , and the rewired links are 50% fm and 50% afm . in the limit @xmath16 , this mapping is the well - known correspondence between afm and fm ising models on bipartite lattices @xcite . in the limit @xmath5 ,",
    "our afm ising model is equivalent to a spin - glass model on a random graph of mean connectivity @xmath17 , with 50% afm and 50% fm bonds .",
    "small - world networks have been built up according to the model of watts and strogatz @xcite , i.e. , we considered in turn each of the bonds in the starting 2d lattice and replaced it with a given probability @xmath0 by a new connection . in this rewiring process ,",
    "one end of the selected bond is changed to a new node chosen at random in the whole network .",
    "we impose the conditions : ( i ) no two nodes can have more than one bond connecting them , and ( ii ) no node can be connected by a link to itself . with this procedure",
    "we obtained networks where more than 99.9% of the sites were connected in a single component .",
    "moreover , this rewiring method keeps constant the total number of links in the rewired networks , and the average connectivity @xmath18 coincides with @xmath19 .",
    "this allows us to study the effect of disorder upon the physical properties of the model , without changing the mean connectivity .",
    "we note that other ways of generating small - world networks from regular lattices have been proposed @xcite .",
    "in particular , instead of rewiring each bond with probability @xmath0 , one can add shortcuts between pairs of sites taken at random , without removing bonds from the regular lattice .",
    "this procedure turns out to be more convenient for analytical calculations , but does not keep constant the mean connectivity @xmath18 , which in this case increases with @xmath0 .",
    "spin glasses on such small - world networks , generated from a one - dimensional ring , have been studied earlier by replica symmetry breaking @xcite and transfer matrix analysis @xcite .    from the 2d square lattice",
    ", we generated small - world networks of different sizes .",
    "the largest networks employed here included 200 @xmath20 200 nodes .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were assumed .",
    "for a given network , we carried out monte carlo simulations at several temperatures , sampling the spin configuration space by the metropolis update algorithm @xcite , and using a simulated annealing procedure .",
    "several variables characterizing the considered model have been calculated and averaged for different values of @xmath0 , @xmath21 , and system size @xmath22 . in general , we have considered 300 networks for each rewiring probability @xmath0 , but we used 1000 networks to determine accurately the transition temperature from paramagnetic to sg phase . in the following , we will use the notation @xmath23 to indicate a thermal average for a network , and @xmath24 $ ] for an average over networks with a given degree of disorder @xmath0 .",
    "the heat capacity per site , @xmath25 , was obtained from the energy fluctuations @xmath26 at a given temperature , by using the expression @xmath27 } { n t^2 }   \\ ,   , \\ ] ] where @xmath28 .",
    "we have checked that the results coincide within numerical noise with those derived by calculating @xmath25 as @xmath29 / n$ ] .",
    "note that we take the boltzmann constant @xmath30 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath25 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for saveral values of the rewiring probability @xmath0 and for networks built up from a @xmath31 2d lattice . for increasing @xmath0 ,",
    "one observes two main features : the maximum of @xmath25 shifts to lower @xmath21 and the peak broadens appreciably .",
    "this broadening agrees with the behavior expected for systems with increasing disorder , similarly to that found for the fm ising model in these networks @xcite .",
    "however , in the afm model , the shift of the peak to lower temperature suggests a phase transition with a temperature @xmath1 that decreases as @xmath0 is raised , contrary to the fm case , where an increase in @xmath1 with @xmath0 was observed .",
    "this difference between both ising models on small - world networks occurs in addition to the nature of the transition itself , which in the fm case is a paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition vs a paramagnetic - sg transition in the afm model ( see below ) .",
    "a decrease in @xmath1 for the afm ising model in this kind of networks was also suggested in ref . from the behavior of the heat capacity for several values of @xmath0 .",
    "the increase in disorder as @xmath0 is raised is accompanied by an increase in frustration of the links at low temperatures .",
    "this can be quantified by the low - temperature energy of the system , which will rise as the rewiring probability is raised . to obtain insight into this energy change for @xmath0 near zero ( low disorder ) ,",
    "let us remember that the square lattice is bipartite , in the sense that one can define two alternating sublattices , say a and b , so that neighbors of each node in sublattice a belong to sublattice b , and vice versa . in the rewiring process , one introduces links between nodes in the same sublattice , and the resulting networks are no longer bipartite .",
    "however , for small rewiring probability @xmath0 , we can still speak about two sublattices , with some `` wrong '' connections . since",
    "each link is rewired with probability @xmath0 , each connection in the starting regular lattice will be transformed into a wrong connection ( of types a  a or b  b ) with probability @xmath32 .",
    "the remaining links are of a  b type , and",
    "the number of wrong connections is on average @xmath33 .",
    "then , for small @xmath0 , the lowest energy can be approximated by @xmath34 , under the assumption that the afm long - range ordering of the square lattice is still preserved . for z = 4",
    ", we have an energy per node : @xmath35 .",
    "note that for finite @xmath0 the low - temperature long - range ordering in fact decays due to the appearance of domains driven by the rewired connections ( see below ) , but the afm ordering is a good reference to obtain insight into the energy change as a function of rewiring probability @xmath0 .",
    "we now turn to the results for the minimum energy reached in our simulations for different @xmath0 values , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for rising @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath36 increases from the value corresponding to afm ordering in the regular lattice , @xmath37 . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] displays the behavior expected for small @xmath0 , in the case of a strict afm ordering on the underlaying lattice .",
    "this estimation is close to the minimum energy obtained in our simulations for @xmath38 . for larger @xmath0 values",
    ", it departs appreciably from the results of the simulations , and @xmath39 lies below the dashed line . in the limit @xmath10",
    "we find a value @xmath40 . in this limit ,",
    "our small - world networks are very close to random networks with a poisson distribution of connectivities , but are not identical to the latter because of the restriction that no nodes have zero links , imposed in the rewiring process @xcite . for a @xmath6 ising spin glass on random graphs with a poisson distribution of connectivities and @xmath17 ,",
    "boettcher @xcite found a ground - state energy @xmath41 by using extremal optimization .",
    "this value is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as a dotted line close to @xmath10 , and is near the minimum energy we found for the small - world networks in this limit . for a more direct comparison with random networks ,",
    "we have carried out some simulations for small - world networks with @xmath10 , where we allowed the presence of isolated sites ( with connectivity @xmath42 ) .",
    "for the afm ising model in these networks , we found a minimum energy @xmath43 , between those of our standard networks ( with minimum connectivity @xmath44 ) and random networks in ref .  .",
    "note that our error bar in @xmath39 corresponds to a standard deviation in the distribution of minimum energy obtained for different networks .",
    "we emphasize that the energy @xmath39 found here for each value of @xmath0 is an upper limit for the lowest energy of the system .",
    "even though the random connections present in small - world networks introduce disorder in the starting regular lattice , these networks still keep memory of the original bipartite lattice , but the actual meaning of the partition in two sublattices is gradually reduced as @xmath0 rises .",
    "this can be measured by the number of wrong links , which amounts to a fraction @xmath32 of the total number of links , as indicated above . in the limit @xmath10 , half of the links",
    "connect sites in the same original sublattice , and the memory of the partition in sublattices has completely disappeared .",
    "one can visualize the loss of afm ordering on the 2d lattice , by plotting the spin correlation vs distance for several values of @xmath0 .",
    "we define @xmath45 as @xmath46    \\ ; ,   \\label{xi}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath47 indicates that the average is taken for the ensemble of pairs of sites at distance @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath48 refers here to the dimensionless distance between sites in the starting regular lattice , not to the actual topological distance or minimum number of links between nodes in the rewired networks ( @xmath49 is the distance between nearest neighbors ) .",
    "the correlation @xmath50 is shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] for several values of the rewiring probability @xmath0 , at temperature @xmath51 .",
    "this temperature is below the critical temperature @xmath1 of the paramagnetic - sg transition for all values of @xmath0 ( see below ) .",
    "as expected , @xmath50 decreases faster for larger @xmath0 , and vanishes at @xmath10 for any distance @xmath52 . in general , after a short transient for small @xmath47 , we find an exponential decrease of the spin correlation with the distance .",
    "this indicates that , in spite of the disorder present in the networks for @xmath53 , there remains some degree of short - range afm ordering on the starting regular lattice , which is totally lost in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "as is usual in the study of spin glasses , we now consider two copies of the same network , with a given realization of the disorder , and study the evolution of both spin systems with different initial values of the spins and different random numbers for generating the spin flips @xcite .",
    "it is particularly relevant the overlap @xmath54 between the two copies , defined as @xmath55 where the superscripts ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) denote the copies .",
    "obviously , @xmath54 is defined in the interval @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "we have calculated the overlap parameter @xmath54 for small - world networks with various rewiring probabilities @xmath0 , and obtained its probability distribution @xmath57 from mc simulations .",
    "this distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for @xmath0 = 0.1 and 0.5 at several temperatures . at high temperature",
    ", @xmath57 shows a single peak centered at @xmath58 , characteristic of a paramagnetic state .",
    "the width of this peak is a typical finite - size effect , which should collapse to a dirac @xmath59 function at @xmath58 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath60 .",
    "when the temperature is lowered , the distribution @xmath57 broadens , as a consequence of the appearance of an increasing number of edges displaying frustration . at still lower temperatures , two peaks develop in @xmath57 , symmetric respect to @xmath9 , and characteristic of a spin - glass phase @xcite .",
    "information on the `` freezing '' of the spins as temperature is lowered can be obtained from the evolution of the average value of @xmath61 , for a given degree of disorder @xmath0 .",

    ", we find a decrease in the low temperature @xmath61 values , due to an increasing degree of frustration .",

    "it is interesting the approximately linear decrease in @xmath1 for increasing @xmath0 up to @xmath73 .",
    "this decrease could be expected from the larger number of frustrated links appearing as @xmath0 is raised",
    ". for increasing frustration , the paramagnetic phase is favored , and the spin glass appears at lower temperature ( @xmath1 is reduced ) .",

    "[ fig1 ] . for @xmath3 ,",
    "small - world networks behave in this respect similarly to poissonian random networks , in the sense that the transition temperature is roughly independent of @xmath0 , and is close to that found for the strong - disorder limit @xmath74 .      even though all data indicate that the afm ising model in small - world networks yields a spin - glass phase at low temperature",
    ", one can ask if such disordered phase appears for any finite value of the rewiring probability .",
    "one could argue that some residual long - range afm ordering could be present for finite but small @xmath0 values . from our considerations in the preceding sections",
    ", one could think that , for small @xmath0 , the low - temperature phase still keeps the long - range ordering characteristic of the 2d regular lattice , with some defects caused by the long - range connections . to analyze this question , we consider a staggered magnetization defined for the square lattice as usual : @xmath75 with @xmath76 and similarly for @xmath77 .",
    "our question then refers to the possibility of a finite value for @xmath78 for small - world networks with @xmath53 .",
    "to check this point , we have carried out simulations starting from an afm ordered configuration and followed the evolution of @xmath78 .",
    "we prefer this procedure to directly calculating the low - temperature staggered magnetization from simulated annealing , since in this case a long - range ordering can be difficult to find for large nerworks , due to the appearance of different spin domains . thus , we analyzed the decay of @xmath78 at temperatures lower than the transition temperature @xmath1 for different system sizes .",
    "in particular , in fig .",
    "8 we show the relaxation of @xmath79 on networks with @xmath80 at a temperature @xmath81 , well below the transition temperature for this rewiring probability ( @xmath82 ) . for each system size , @xmath79 decreases from unity to reach a plateau at a finite value , which is clearly a finite - size effect , as seen in the figure . as the system size increases ,",
    "such a plateau appears after longer simulation times , and the corresponding value of @xmath79 decreases .",
    "these results are consistent with the decay of the spin correlation @xmath50 at temperatures below @xmath1 , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for several values of @xmath0 .    for @xmath83",
    ", a relaxation of @xmath78 is expected to appear for larger system sizes and longer simulation runs .",
    "everything indicates that at low @xmath21 the long - range ordering disappears in the thermodynamic limit @xmath60 for any @xmath7 .",
    "this is in line with earlier results for the fm ising model on this kind of networks , in the sense that the paramagnetic - fm transition occurring in those systems changes from an ising - type transition at @xmath84 to a mean - field - type one ( typical of random networks ) for any finite value of the rewiring probability @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the observation of this mean - field character for the paramagnetic - fm transition requires system sizes that increase as the rewiring probability is lowered @xcite , similarly to the decay of the staggered magnetization in the afm case shown here .",
