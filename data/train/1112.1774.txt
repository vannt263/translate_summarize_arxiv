    "<S> the extended galileon models possess tracker solutions with de sitter attractors along which the dark energy equation of state is constant during the matter - dominated epoch , i.e. @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a positive constant . </S>",
    "<S> even with this phantom equation of state there are viable parameter spaces in which the ghosts and laplacian instabilities are absent . using the observational data of the supernovae type ia , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and baryon acoustic oscillations , we place constraints on the tracker solutions at the background level and find that the parameter @xmath1 is constrained to be @xmath2 ( 95 % cl ) in the flat universe . in order to break the degeneracy between the models we also study the evolution of cosmological density perturbations relevant to the large - scale structure ( lss ) and the integrated - sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect in cmb . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , depending on the model parameters , the lss and the isw effect is either positively or negatively correlated . </S>",
    "<S> it is then possible to constrain viable parameter spaces further from the observational data of the isw - lss cross - correlation as well as from the matter power spectrum . </S>"
