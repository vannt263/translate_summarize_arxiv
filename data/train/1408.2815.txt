    "<S> we perform first - principle calculations of elemental cerium and compute its pressure - temperature phase diagram , finding good quantitative agreement with the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations indicate that , while a signature of the volume - collapse transition appears in the free energy already at low temperatures , at larger temperatures this signature is enhanced because of the entropic effects , and originates an actual thermodynamical instability . furthermore , we find that the catalyst determining this feature is  in all temperature regimes  a pressure - induced effective reduction of the @xmath0-level degeneracy due to the spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis suggests also that the lattice vibrations might be crucial in order to capture the behavior of the pressure - temperature transition line at large temperatures .    at ambient temperature </S>",
    "<S> elemental cerium undergoes a pressure - induced first - order isostructural transition , which is accompanied by a volume collapse of about @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical pressure where this transition occurs increases linearly with the temperature , and the corresponding transition line in the pressure - temperature phase diagram ends at a critical temperature @xmath2 . since 1949 , </S>",
    "<S> when the @xmath3-@xmath4 transition was discovered , it has stimulated a lot of experimental and theoretical work , but a complete theoretical description of this phenomenon is still lacking . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , two theoretical pictures are still nowadays under debate : ( i ) the kondo volume collapse model ( kvc ) , that was proposed by allen and martin  @xcite and independently by lavagna , lacroix , and cyrot  @xcite , and ( ii ) the orbital - selective mott transition ( hm ) , that was proposed by johansson  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference between these two models is that , while the kvc attributes the @xmath3-@xmath4 transition of cerium to a rapid change of the degree of hybridization between the @xmath0 electrons and the @xmath5 conduction bands ( and consequently of the kondo temperature ) , within the hm transition the key quantity whose rapid variation is repsonsible of the transition is the kinetic energy of the @xmath0 electrons , while the itinerant electrons are inert spectators of the transition . </S>",
    "<S> consistently with both the hm and the kvc , photoemission experiments  @xcite have demonstrated that the @xmath0 electrons are correlated both in the @xmath3 phase and in the @xmath4 phase . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> calculations of the optical spectrum  @xcite have enabled to interpret the experiments  @xcite in favor of the kvc .    in our view , there are few fundamental questions that have to be answered in order fully understand the physics underlying the @xmath3-@xmath4 transition or cerium . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) why does @xmath6 vary rapidly only within a narrow window of volumes rather than varying smoothly ? ( 2 ) how does the rapid variation of @xmath6 affect the free energy and , in particular , generate the @xmath3-@xmath4 isostructural transition ? ( 3 ) is the fact that the @xmath3-@xmath4 isostructural transition ends at @xmath2 purely due to electronic effects or does it require to take into account the temperature - induced lattice vibrations ?    </S>",
    "<S> recent first principle calculations of cerium  @xcite within the gutzwiller approximation in combination with the local density approximation ( lda+ga ) have suggested a possible solution to the first of the questions listed above . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , these calculations have shown that a clear signature of the @xmath3-@xmath4 isostructural transition of cerium can be observed at zero temperature if ( and only if ) the spin - orbit coupling is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , they have shown that the reason underlying this result is that the spin - orbit coupling effectively reduces the @xmath0-level degeneracy from @xmath7 to @xmath8 when the hybridization strength is reduced by increasing the volume , thus causing a crossover in the evolution of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> on the contrary , if the spin - orbit couping is not taken into account @xmath6 evolves smoothly as a function of the volume . </S>",
    "<S> this point of view has been further clarified in a following work  @xcite making use of the `` principle of maximum entanglement entropy '' . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the spin - orbit coupling for the determination of the thermodynamical properties of cerium has been finally confirmed also within the framework of lda in combination with dynamical mean field theory ( lda+dmft )  @xcite , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the spin - orbit coupling was neglected because of the great computational complexity of the problem . in fact , the lda+dmft low - temperature pressure - volume phase diagram  that is in very good quantitative agreement with the lda+ga calculations of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite  does not display any signature of the transition at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it was shown that , if the spin - orbit coupling is neglected , not even the entropy is sufficient to induce a thermodynamical instability , but only a softening of the bulk modulus .    </S>",
    "<S> the second of the questions listed above is particularly challenging , as a rapid variation of @xmath6 affects differently the internal energy @xmath9 and the entropy @xmath10 of the system . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , at small volumes ( where @xmath11 ) the kondo - stabilization effect decreases the internal - energy  @xcite , while the entropy is small ; on the contrary , at large volumes ( where @xmath12 ) the entropy of the system is large , thus decreasing considerably the free energy and stabilizing the @xmath3 phase . because of these reasons , it is rather complicated to predict quantitatively the behavior of the free energy @xmath13 in concomitance with a rapid variation of @xmath6 , and accurate first - principles calculations are essential in order to study this problem .    since the spin - orbit coupling and </S>",
    "<S> the entropic effects are both important at finite temperatures , it is clear that in order to fully understand the @xmath3-@xmath4 transition at finite temperatures ( and in particular to answer the second and the third questions listed above ) it is essential to perform first principles calculations able to take into account both of these physical effects . in this work , besides taking into account the spin - orbit coupling , we describe the entropic effects at finite temperatures by employing a charge self - consistent combination of lda with the rotationally - invariant slave - boson ( sb ) mean - field theory  @xcite , that we have implemented following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that this method is equivalent to lda+ga at zero temperature  @xcite and , although it is not as accurate as lda+dmft , it has the advantage to be much less computationally demanding . for completeness , in the supplemental material is given a brief introduction of the lda+sb method .    as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we employ the `` standard '' prescription for the double - counting functional and the general ( rotationally - invariant ) slater - condon parametrization  @xcite of the on - site interaction , assuming that the hund s coupling constant is @xmath14 and that the value of the interaction - strength is @xmath15 .     where the pressure @xmath16 achieves it s maximum ( positive ) value . </S>",

    "<S> [ figure1 ] is shown the evolution of the free energy @xmath13 at different temperatures @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> while at small volumes @xmath18 is not very sensitive to @xmath17 , at larger volumes it is considerably reduced by the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> because of this effect , at @xmath19 the @xmath3 phase is stable at zero pressure , while at lower temperatures the @xmath3 phase is stable only at negative pressures . in other words , consistently with the experiments , our calculations indicate that at @xmath19 the volume - collapse transition occurs at positive pressures . </S>",
    "<S> the boundaries of the transition have been evaluated within the common - tangent construction , and are indicated by the dots in the inset of the upper panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the pressure - volume curves , that are calculated from the free energy @xmath18 using @xmath20 , are shown in the middle panel of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the critical pressures ( at different temperatures ) are here identified by the equal - area construction , and are indicated by horizontal lines . </S>",
    "<S> the volumes @xmath21 where @xmath16 reaches the maximum value are indicated by vertical lines . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , our finite - temperature calculations are in very good agreement with the room - temperature experimental pressure - volume phase diagram . in particular , note that the entropic effects improve the comparison with the experiments at large volumes , which confirms that they are very important to describe the thermodynamical properties of cerium , especially in the @xmath3 phase .    in the lower panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] is shown the evolution as a function of the volume of the gutzwiller quasi - particle renormalization weights of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath0-electrons . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the overall qualitative behavior of the quasi - particle weights is similar for all temperatures : both @xmath24 and @xmath25 are significantly smaller than @xmath26 already at high pressures , and in this regime they monotonically decrease as a function of the volume ; on the contrary , at volumes larger than a temperature - dependent crossover volume @xmath21 we observe that @xmath25 increases while @xmath24 rapidly decreases . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior was already discussed in the zero - temperature calculations of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and reflects the above - mentioned effective reduction of the @xmath0-level degeneracy from @xmath7 to @xmath8 due to the spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , here we find that the crossover of the @xmath27 s takes place for all temperatures at the same volume @xmath21 where @xmath16 reaches its maximum value . </S>",
    "<S> this finding indicates that , also at finite temperatures , the @xmath3-@xmath4 volume - collapse transition is induced by the rapid reduction of the kondo temperature , which occurs because the spin - orbit coupling effectively reduces the @xmath0-level degeneracy from @xmath7 to @xmath8 at @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> note that , while at zero temperature we find that @xmath29 even at large volumes , at @xmath30 we find that @xmath31 for all volumes larger than a critical value @xmath32 , which approaches @xmath21 when the temperature is increased . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is suggestive respect to the considerations of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which partially reconciliate the hm and the kvc pictures at finite temperatures . on the other hand , we believe that the second - order selective mott transition found in our calculations does not reflect an actual physical effect , but is an artifact of the sb approximation scheme . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we do not expect that in cerium a transition should be observed as a function of the volume , but only as a function of the pressure . in any case , we point out that the thermodynamical properties or cerium are determined exclusively by the free energy , which does not display any singular behavior at @xmath33 in our calculations .     </S>",
    "<S> and negative pressures indicates the signature of the transition identified by a maximum ( but negative ) value of @xmath16 , while the other points indicate actual thermodynamical instabilities identified by a positive value of @xmath16 . </S>",

    "<S> [ figure2 ] the theoretical pressure - temperature phase diagram extrapolated from the free - energy curves of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] is shown in comparison with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> note that at zero temperature no transition is observed in our calculations with @xmath15 , but only a signature identified by a maximum ( but negative ) value of @xmath16 , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the empty square at @xmath34 and negative pressures indicates this signature . remarkably , the behavior of the transition line in the pressure - temperature phase diagram is in good agreement with the experiments , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , note that the critical pressure @xmath35 increases as a function of the temperature , and it is positive for @xmath19 . on the other hand , our calculations do not reproduce the experimental behavior of the transition line at high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , while experimentally the transition line ends at @xmath2 , our calculations indicate that the transition line continues far beyond the range of temperatures displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] , as a volume - collapse transition is observed even at @xmath36 .     as a function of the volume evaluated at different temperatures @xmath17 by fixing the corresponding critical pressures @xmath37 of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the continue curves are obtained by fitting the free energy data of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ figure3 ] are shown the thermodynamical potentials @xmath40 as a function of the volume , which are evaluated at different @xmath17 by fixing the corresponding critical pressures @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> consistently with the definition of the common - tangent construction , @xmath41 displays a double - minima structure , indicating that the system is unstable at @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the energy - barrier @xmath43 between the @xmath4 and @xmath3 phases is smaller than @xmath44 for all of the temperatures considered , and it increases monotonically with @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> note also that @xmath43 increases rapidly only at low temperatures , while it remains almost unchanged between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> we point out that , within the born - hoppenheimer approximation , the function @xmath47 represents the effective potential experienced by the cerium atoms at fixed temperature @xmath17 and pressure @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this observation suggests that the lattice vibrations  which were not taken into account in our calculations  might be the actual reason why the transition line ends at the finite temperature @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , since the energy - barrier @xmath43 is very small even at high temperatures , it might be possible that , because of the temperature - induced lattice vibrations , the atom - configurations `` sample '' simultaneously both the @xmath4 and the @xmath3 phase not only at the critical pressure @xmath35 defined above , but also within a small interval of pressures @xmath49 , thus transforming the volume - collapse transition in a crossover when the temperature is sufficiently high .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated from first principles the phase diagram of fcc cerium , finding good agreement with the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis suggests that the iso - structural pressure - induced @xmath3-@xmath4 transition is induced by a rapid variation of the kondo temperature , which occurs because of the interplay between the spin - orbit coupling and the @xmath0-electron correlations . </S>",
    "<S> while a signature of the volume - collapse transition appears in the free energy already at low temperatures , at higher temperatures this signature is enhanced because of the entropic effects , and originates an actual thermodynamical instability . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the theoretical thermodynamical potential at constant pressure indicates that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 phases are separated by a very small energy barrier at all temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this observation suggests an appealing possible explanation of why the pressure - temperature transition line ends at @xmath2 : at @xmath50 the atom configurations might be able to overcome the above - mentioned barrier and sample simultaneously the @xmath3 and @xmath4 phases even slightly before the critical pressure , thus transforming the @xmath3-@xmath4 transition in a crossover . in order to clarify this point , and thus answer the third of the questions listed in the introduction of this work </S>",
    "<S> , it would be interesting to perform molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite , e.g. , using effective atomistic potentials extrapolated from the free - energy curves of this work . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , this issue could be investigated by performing direct monte carlo simulations ( iterating lda+sb calculations of cerium with a large unit cell ) . </S>"
