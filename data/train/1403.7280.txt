    "currently , some 180 different molecules have been detected in dense inter- and circumstellar clouds , largely in radio- and submilimeter surveys , with this number growing with several new species per year .",
    "however , only about ten simple molecules are observed in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum as absorption features originating in translucent clouds , transparent for optical wavelengths . among them",
    "are homonuclear species , such as h@xmath9 , c@xmath9 and c@xmath0 , which are not accessible to radio observations .",
    "bare carbon chains do not exhibit pure rotational transitions , because of the lack of a permanent dipole moment , and thus only their electronic or vibrational spectral features can be observed .",
    "the latter cover the spectral range from the vacuum uv until the far infrared .",
    "determination of the abundances of simple carbon molecules in interstellar clouds is important , as they are considered building blocks for many already known interstellar molecules with a carbon skeleton .",
    "after the @xmath10 century discovery of the 4052   band in the spectrum of comet tebbutt @xcite and the assignment of this blue absorption feature to the c@xmath0 molecule @xcite , the triatomic carbon chain radical was detected in the circumstellar shell of the star irc+10216 @xcite and subsequently , albeit tentatively , in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected nine lines of the @xmath11 bending mode towards sgr b2 and irc+10216 , observed in the laboratory by  @xcite .",
    "this spectral range is , however , not applicable to observations of translucent clouds .",
    "high resolution observations using the herschel / hifi instrument detected transitions of c@xmath12 originating in the warm envelopes of massive star forming regions  @xcite ; in these environments high densities of @xmath13 @xmath14 prevail , whereas in diffuse clouds densities are limited to @xmath15 @xmath14 .",
    "the presence of c@xmath0 in the diffuse interstellar medium was proven by @xcite , based on the detection of the @xmath16x@xmath17 000000 band close to 4052    towards three reddened stars . up to now the highest resolution study of c@xmath0 in such environments",
    "was reported by  @xcite , although restricted to a few objects only .",
    "these observations provided the only reliable estimates so far of the abundance of this molecule , yielding values an order of magnitude below that of c@xmath9 .",
    "other observations of c@xmath0 in translucent clouds  @xcite suffered from lower signal - to - noise ratios , giving rise to large uncertainties in the deduced column densities .    the existing data for linear carbon molecules longer than c@xmath0 , like c@xmath18 @xcite , or c@xmath19 @xcite , fail to provide firm evidence for their existence in the interstellar medium @xcite . for a systematic investigation of the conditions under which carbon - based molecules are produced in the interstellar medium , a larger class of targets exhibiting a variety of optical properties and physical conditions in the intervening clouds",
    "has to be observed .",
    "the targeted objects should be selected for translucent clouds with the carbon - bearing molecules producing a single doppler - velocity component , thus allowing for an unambiguous analysis of the spectrum , and resulting in accurate column densities .",
    "the identification of the carriers of diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) remains , since their discovery by @xcite , one of the persistently unresolved problems in spectroscopy .",
    "the current list of unidentified interstellar absorption features contains more than 400 entries @xcite .",
    "the presence of substructures inside dib profiles , discovered by @xcite and by @xcite , supports the hypothesis of their molecular origin . the established relation between profile widths of dibs and rotational temperatures of linear carbon molecules",
    "@xcite makes the latter interesting targets for observations .",
    "both c@xmath9 and c@xmath0 may show different rotational temperatures along different lines of sight , as shown by @xcite .",
    "this is associated with the fact that their rotational transitions are forbidden and thus cooling of their internal degrees of freedom is inefficient . for this reason ,",
    "an accurate determination of rotational excitation temperatures of short carbon chains may help to shed light on the origin of the mysterious carriers of the dibs @xcite .",
    "observationally , the spectral features originating from either c@xmath9 or c@xmath0 typically turn out to be rather shallow and thus high s / n ratios and high spectral resolution are required to establish accurate values for the excitation temperature .",
    "the aim of the present investigation is to use the superior capabilities of uves - vlt to obtain high quality spectra of c@xmath0 .",
    "all previous studies were based solely on the strongest 000000 band of the @xmath16x@xmath17 electronic system . here",
    "additional vibronic bands in the @xmath16x@xmath17 electronic system of c@xmath0 are identified along sight lines towards objects hd  169454 , hd  73882 , and hd  154368 .",

    "the astronomical observations are supported by a high - quality laboratory investigation , using cavity ring - down laser spectroscopy , producing fully rotationally resolved c@xmath0 spectra of the vibronic bands in the   x system .",
    "the combined information of laboratory and observed spectra is used to deduce column densities and a rotational temperature of c@xmath0 in hd  169454 the results are interpreted in terms of excitation models for c@xmath0 @xcite and a chemical model of a translucent cloud towards hd  169454 .",
    "the observational material , of which a target list is presented in table  [ table1 ] , was obtained using the uves spectrograph mounted on the eso very large telescope at paranal ( chile ) with resolution @xmath20 in the blue arm ( 3020  4980",

    "as a consequence , the initial population of the highest rotational levels in the formation process may not change significantly by collisions before the molecule is destroyed by photodissociation . for a quantitative estimate of the population distribution two crude approximations",
    "were made .",
    "first , it was assumed that the destruction rate of c@xmath12 is the same in each energetic state .",
    "second , c@xmath12 is assumed to be formed in rotational states following a boltzmann distribution characterized by a formation temperature , @xmath28 .    for the analysis of our data",

    "the calculations are performed with the radex code of  @xcite .",
    "minor modifications are necessary to include production and destruction terms into the statistical equilibrium equations .",
    "there is some degeneracy in the model parameters providing good fits to the observed populations .",
    "a one parameter family of models may be constructed as a function of the gas density , here assumed to be composed of molecular hydrogen .",

    "a @xmath30-test of the goodness - of - fit was used for the determination of the best fits among the family of models assuming a 1 percent significance level .",

    "the models are also characterized by the gas kinetic temperature @xmath32 , the formation temperature @xmath28 , and the destruction rate @xmath33 of c@xmath0 per particle in s@xmath34 .",
    "the best fits for fixed densities @xmath29 are described by the following sets of ( @xmath29 , @xmath35 , @xmath33 ) parameters : ( 400 @xmath14 , 12 k , 0.5@xmath3610@xmath37 s@xmath34 ) , ( 500 @xmath14 , 13 k , @xmath38 s@xmath34 ) , ( 1000 @xmath14 , 16 k , 1@xmath3610@xmath37 s@xmath34 ) , and ( 5000 @xmath14 , 18 k , 5@xmath3610@xmath37 s@xmath34 ) . the formation temperature @xmath28 is not well determined and may vary between 150 and 750 k , with a highest probability at 300 k. we estimate uncertainties of 2 k in the gas temperature and up to 30 % in the destruction rate for each model . for higher densities above @xmath39 @xmath14 , one observes that the population distribution depends on the ratio of the collisional rate to the destruction rate , @xmath40 , with @xmath41 the rate coefficient . a representative model for @xmath39 @xmath14",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ figrotdiagram ] with the red line .",
    "the distribution of column densities in the other models cited above are virtually the same and are not shown .",
    "recently , @xcite computed collisional rates of c@xmath12 colliding with helium for low rotational states @xmath42 and for a gas temperature in the range of 5 to 15k . in our model",
    "the rate coefficients are scaled by 1.38 to represent collisions with h@xmath43 instead of he and used in a second tier of calculations based on these collision rates .",
    "de - excitations from higher levels are fixed at values from the highest available @xmath44 rotational level .",
    "the de - excitation collisional rates of rotational levels of the ground vibrational state are an order of magnitude larger than the @xmath45 @xmath46s@xmath34 assumed by @xcite . as a result",
    ", the models with the new collisional rates require a much higher destruction rate to fit the observed column densities well .",
    "this is shown in the two exemplary models characterized by set of ( @xmath29 , @xmath35 , @xmath33 ) parameters : ( 500 @xmath14 , 18 k , @xmath47 s@xmath34 ) and ( 1000 @xmath14 , 18 k ,",
    "@xmath48 s@xmath34 ) . also in this set of models the broad range of formation temperatures between 150 and 750 k with peak probability around 250 k is acceptable . in a large range of densities",
    "the gas temperature is virtually constant and amounts to 18 k with a higher uncertainty of 3 k. the representative model corresponding to @xmath29=500 @xmath14 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figrotdiagram ] as a blue line .",
    "even if the conversion of collisional rates to collisions with h@xmath43 is inaccurate , collisions with only he ( 20 percent of the molecular hydrogen density ) require an increase of the destruction rate @xmath33 by over a factor two with respect to the original model of @xcite .",
    "the presented models can not determine uniquely the gas density nor the destruction rate or the formation temperature without additional assumptions made for these parameters .",
    "the first set of excitation models requires that @xmath29 must be higher than 2000 @xmath14 to produce a gas kinetic temperature @xmath32 in agreement with the excitation temperature @xmath8 , here 22k , derived from the low-@xmath6 curve in the boltzmann plot .",
    "the second set of models does not allow to put any such constraints on the density .",
    "if the destruction of c@xmath12 is mainly caused by photodissociation then the photodissociation rate in the radiative field defined by @xcite amounts to @xmath49s@xmath34 @xcite .",
    "assuming that the center of the cloud for a total extinction a@xmath50 of 2.8 - 3.4 ( see section 7 ) is penetrated by such a radiation field and that in the uv - range extinction is twice as high as in the visible range , a destruction rate of @xmath51 follows .",
    "hence , a significant enhancement of the radiation field is necessary to explain the results of models with collisional rates based on computations by  @xcite . another possibility , not further discussed here , is that other c@xmath12 destruction processes are decisive . clearly",
    ", more detailed research on collisional rates is necessary before the physical conditions of the molecular gas can be deduced in detail from the c@xmath0 column densities .",
    "since the first identification of c@xmath0 in diffuse clouds by @xcite estimations of c@xmath0 abundances are prone to large uncertainties due to low signal - to - noise ratios of the astronomical observations .",
    "available determinations of column densities for c@xmath12 towards hd  169454 are summarized in table  [ table6 ] .",
    "@xcite were able to extract populations of only five rotational levels up to @xmath52 .",
    "an estimate of the column density was made by @xcite on the basis of the contour shape of the pile of q - lines . in the present high resolution analysis individual transitions",
    "are resolved in the @xmath16 x@xmath17 000000 band and complementary information from the vibronic bands is used , yielding accurate column densities for c@xmath0 .",
    "the chemical formation pathway of c@xmath12 in diffuse clouds is closely related to two other molecules commonly observed in the optical range , c@xmath43 and ch ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the c@xmath43 molecule provides also information on the gas temperature , analogous to c@xmath12 .",
    "the column density of c@xmath9 in the sight line to hd  169454 was analyzed previously .",
    "@xcite derived n@xmath53(c@xmath9 ) @xmath54 @xmath4 and a gas temperature of 19 k. recently , @xcite redefined the c@xmath9 excitation model by  @xcite , and based on new collisional rates of  @xcite it was suggested that this diffuse cloud must be composed of two spatial components . from an analysis of the observational c@xmath9 data of  @xcite , they identified a dense component with @xmath55 @xmath14 and a more diffuse component of 50 @xmath14 assuming background galactic radiation as in  @xcite .",
    "the gas temperatures in the two components were estimated at 20 and 100 k , respectively .",
    "the parameters of the dense component are very close to those determined by @xcite , @xmath56 @xmath14 and @xmath57 = 19 k , using the original model by @xcite .",
    "column densities of ch based on the strong 4300  line in the sight line to hd  169454 have been reported previously ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "here we determine a column density from the weaker ch b - x system , which is in agreement with the previous result , but more accurate .",
    "the column density of molecular hydrogen towards hd  169454 was never directly determined .",
    "we estimate n(h@xmath9 ) at @xmath58 @xmath4 indirectly from the correlation of h@xmath9 with ch using a relation found by @xcite . the total column density of n(c@xmath0 ) = @xmath59 @xmath4 then corresponds to a fractional abundance c@xmath0/h@xmath9 = @xmath60 .",
    "the present determination of the collisional temperature of @xmath61 k for c@xmath0 compares well with the value of @xmath62 k obtained for c@xmath9 towards the same line of sight @xcite .",
    "excitation models for c@xmath0 @xcite and for c@xmath9 @xcite assume that the lowest rotational levels from which the excitation temperature is determined are close to thermal .",
    "this suggests that the gas temperature for both species should be about the same , i.e. @xmath63  k. a detailed analysis in terms of excitation models for c@xmath0 shows that the value of 21 k lies in acceptable range of parameters , with some exceptions for when the gas density @xmath29 is lower than 2000 @xmath14 in the first set of models . at lower gas densities of 350 - 500 @xmath14 , as suggested by the analysis of excitation of c@xmath9 towards hd  169454 @xcite , a lower value for the gas temperature is necessary .",
    "this may be attributed to the fact that c@xmath0 should form in the central part of the diffuse cloud toward hd  169454 , at a slightly lower gas kinetic temperature . in view of the many uncertainties in the prevailing excitation models we consider these values as in acceptable agreement .",
    "the derived value of the gas temperature is close to that found in detailed models of diffuse molecular clouds including processes on grains  @xcite . for a@xmath64 = 1.7 the gas kinetic temperature for @xmath65",
    "@xmath14 and radiation field expressed in units of the draine field intensity g@xmath66 = 1 is in the range between 15 and 20 k ( see fig . 11 in @xcite ) and similarly for @xmath67 @xmath14 and g@xmath66=10 ( see fig . 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "the excitation model for c@xmath9 allows an estimation of the ratio of @xmath68 to g@xmath66 and does not constrain the radiation field .",
    "@xcite observed c@xmath9 and ch ( as well as cn ) towards hd  169454 detecting two slightly separated ( by @xmath69 km s@xmath34 ) velocity components in the c@xmath9 lines .",
    "the possible presence of multiple clouds in the sight line does not impair the obtained results , because the lines are optically thin and the excitation conditions and gas densities derived by @xcite are quite similar .",
    "however , presence of multiple clouds may influence the chemical analysis , effectively lowering the optical depth to the external radiation field in each cloud .",
    "the observational data offer another opportunity to analyze the chemical abundances of small carbon chains in a molecular cloud in the sight line to hd  169454 .",
    "such a model was presented in an extensive analysis by @xcite .",
    "here we use the meudon pdr code @xcite for the computation of the chemical composition of the plane - parallel cloud irradiated by the average galactic background radiation field .",
    "hd  169454 is a b1 ia star @xcite with b - v determined at 0.90 @xcite .",
    "this translates to e(b - v ) = 1.09 according to @xcite . assuming the typical total to selective extinction ratio r=3.1",
    ", we find that a@xmath70=3.4 .",
    "the standard mean galactic extinction curve @xcite is used in the model , which seems to reproduce the extinction curve towards hd  169454 @xcite well .",
    "we further assume , that the translucent cloud is irradiated from both sides by the far ultraviolet radiation field . the resulting field in the central part of the cloud of total thickness a@xmath70",
    "is then reduced by extinction of only half of that . in the case of asymmetric illumination , or of a special arrangement of the cloud in the line of sight",
    ", a@xmath64 may be even smaller .",
    "we have performed a calculation for a single cloud with a total density of 500 @xmath14 and a gas temperature of 20  k illuminated by the radiation field enhanced with a factor g@xmath66 of 4 relative to the standard value of @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figchem ] . with these parameters",
    "we reproduce the observed abundance ratio of c@xmath9/c@xmath0 @xmath1 10 for a@xmath64=2.36 .",
    "the prediction for the abundance of c@xmath18 at this a@xmath64 value is two orders lower than the abundance of c@xmath0 suggesting that more observational efforts are necessary to detect also c@xmath18 in translucent clouds .",
    "the calculated abundance of ch is slightly higher than the observed value .",
    "assuming that the optical extinction a@xmath64 lower than the value is estimated from e(b - v ) , good agreement may be reached also for other combinations of a@xmath64 and g@xmath66 : e.g. a@xmath64=1.86 and g@xmath66=2 , a@xmath64=2.66 and g@xmath66=6 .    , c@xmath0 , and c@xmath18 carbon species computed as a function of the total visual absorption a@xmath64 . , width=317 ]",
    "it is a very complex task to make reasonable assumptions concerning the internal structure of any interstellar cloud .",
    "clouds are likely non - homogeneous and asymmetrically irradiated by neighbouring stars . another problem is the dust content . as demonstrated recently by @xcite the abundance ratio of the simple radicals ch and cn also depends on the shape of the extinction curve .    to illustrate the strong dependence on far - uv extinction we display spectra with very distinct c@xmath9 spectral features toward two stars that have practically the same e(b - v ) .",

    "as far as the rate coefficients and photodissociation rates are established , the model depends on the ratio of gas density to intensity of radiation field .",

    "the regular pattern of c@xmath0 bands allows for an unambiguous identification , as shown in the present study .",
