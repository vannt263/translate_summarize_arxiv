    "globular clusters ( gcs ) can be used to probe the properties of their host galaxies field stars .",
    "this is especially important for distant systems whose field stars are unresolved but whose gcs can be observed with integrated - light ( il ) spectroscopy .",
    "detailed abundances of gcs are useful for examining the formation and evolution of a galaxy , particularly whether its gcs formed in a massive galaxy or were accreted from dwarf satellites .",
    "this process of chemical tagging is possible with high - resolution il spectroscopy , and can be applied to a variety of gc systems .",
    "this talk showcases the results from @xcite , who determined integrated abundances of seven outer halo ( @xmath2 kpc ) m31 gcs , five of which were discovered in the pan - andromeda archaeological survey ( pandas ; @xcite ) .",
    "the location of these gcs in the outer halo , their kinematics @xcite , and/or their projected locations along stellar streams @xcite strongly suggest an accretion scenario for many of these gcs .",
    "detailed abundances can also be useful for determining the properties of the host dwarf galaxies .",
    "spectra of the seven target gcs were obtained with the high resolution spectrograph on the hobby - eberly telescope , yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath3 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "s / n ratios ranged from @xmath4 per resolution element . _ hubble space telescope _ partially resolved",
    "photometry ( down to the horizontal branch ) was used to constrain the ages and metallicities of the gc stellar populations ; the final adopted ages and metallicities were then determined spectroscopically ( see @xcite ) .",
    "basti isochrones @xcite were adopted to model the underlying populations .",
    "integrated abundances were determined with the ilabunds code @xcite .",
    "+ detailed abundances of a variety of elements ( fe , na , mg , ca , ti , ni , ba , and eu ) are given in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows integrated [ ca / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] in the pandas gcs compared to the abundances from individual field stars in the milky way and various satellite galaxies . note that the gc ca abundances follow the chemical evolution profile of field stars that formed in the same birth environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; the integrated [ ca / fe ] is therefore a useful abundance ratio for chemical tagging purposes .",
    "several of the pandas gcs have low [ ca / fe ] ( and other ratios , such as high [ ba / eu ] ) indicating that they likely formed in dwarf galaxies that are currently being accreted by m31 .",
    "the abundances themselves are also useful for constraining the mass of the progenitor dwarf galaxies  for example , pa17 ( the most metal - rich target ) has abundances that are more consistent with a galaxy like the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) or the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal ( sgr ) than with the fornax dwarf ( for ) .",
    "these detailed abundances can be combined with kinematic and spatial information to link gcs with specific progenitor streams and/or other gcs .",
    "pa17 s high [ fe / h ] and low [ ca / fe ] suggest that it may be associated with the metal - rich giant stellar stream ( gss ; see , e.g. , @xcite)though it does not lie along the gss , models suggest that the stream may have multiple wraps around m31 @xcite .",
    "the moderate - metallicity gc h10 lies on an extension of the sw cloud , and has similar abundances and kinematics to its gcs @xcite .",
    "h10 s [ ca / fe ] implies that the sw cloud progenitor likely had a similar mass as sgr .",
    "finally , the more metal - poor gcs pa53 and pa56 have similar abundances to each other , plus similar kinematics to two gcs that lie along the nearby eastern cloud @xcite .",
    "the abundances of pa53 and pa56 indicate that the progenitor of the eastern cloud was likely similar to the fornax dwarf galaxy .",
    "+ together , the combination of resolved photometry and il spectroscopy has demonstrated that m31 s outer halo is at least partially been built up by the accretion of satellite dwarfs .",
    "studies of the outer halo field stars and the gcs have provided essential information about the masses of the satellites that are being accreted to form m31 s outer halo .",
    "this level of detail will be difficult to achieve in more distant galaxies , particularly when the field stars can not be resolved .",
    "when resolved photometry is no longer feasible , il spectroscopy of gcs remains a powerful tool for unraveling the assembly histories for distant , unresolved systems .",
