    "the gonihedric string was introduced by savvidy et .",
    "@xcite as a new action for random surfaces . for triangulated surfaces ,",
    "the action reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 is the angle between the neighbouring triangles with common link @xmath3 .",
    "this string model can be considered as a natural extension of the feynman integral over paths to an integral over surfaces in the sense , that both amplitudes coincide in cases , when the surface degenerates into a single particle world line .",
    "the simulation of ( [ gonihedric ] ) shows flat surfaces @xcite , although some problems arise from the failure to suppress the wanderings of vertices @xcite .",
    "one possibility to regularize the gonihedric action is to formulate the model on the euclidean lattice , which has been done by wegner and savvidy .",
    "there are two essentially distinct cases which correspond to non - self - avoiding surfaces @xcite and to soft - self - avoiding ones @xcite . in the former case self - inter \"- sections of the surface do not produce any additional energy , while in case of soft - self - avoiding surfaces , the energy contribution of a link , where self - intersection occurs was defined by @xmath4 times the number of pairs of plaquettes which meet under a right angle .",
    "it was shown , that in both cases a @xmath5 ising model can be constructed , which reproduce the same surface dynamics and an extension to @xmath6-dimensional hypersurfaces on a @xmath7-dimensional lattice was also given .",
    "in this paper we consider the case of @xmath8-dimensional soft - self - avoiding surfaces on a @xmath7-dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "the statistical weight of each surface configuration is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of links , where two @xmath8-dimensional plaquettes meet under a right angle ( i.e.  the mean extrinsic curvature ) and @xmath11 is the number of plaquettes , where four plaquettes meet .",
    "this additional term arises , when two surfaces touch each other and is responsible for the soft - self - avoidance .",
    "the equivalent spin systems contain just ferromagnetic nearest neighbour and antiferromagnetic next nearest neighbour couplings .",
    "if one wants to allow arbitrary self - intersection coupling @xmath12 , i.e.  @xmath13 , the corresponding spin - hamiltonian contains also a plaquette term . the two dimensional model for @xmath14 does not seem to show a phase phase transition @xcite @xcite , whereas in three dimensions a second order phase transition occurs at @xmath15 which is close two the critical temperature of the two dimensional ising model .",
    "these results were obtained by numerical simulations .",
    "the three dimensional gonihedric ising system was also discussed for arbitrary @xmath12 in @xcite using mean field methods and simulations .",
    "the authors find a second order phase transition for @xmath12 and a qualitatively different behaviour for the case @xmath16 .",
    "the critical temperature for @xmath12 was shown to increase with increasing @xmath17 .    in this work",
    "we prove the existence of an ordered low temperature phase for @xmath12 in @xmath18 dimensions using a suitable extension of peierls contour method @xcite .",
    "after recapitulating the model , we adapt peierls argument to the case @xmath14 .",
    "an upper bound for @xmath19 for the three dimensional model is found , which is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "finally we show , how to generalize the argument for arbitrary @xmath12 .",
    "consider a @xmath7-dimensional euclidean lattice , with lattice points @xmath20 . we define a @xmath6-dimensional hyperplaquette @xmath21 ( all @xmath22 different ) by @xmath23 for convenience we call a @xmath8-dimensional hyperplaquette simply a plaquette , a @xmath24-dimensional hyperplaquette a link and a @xmath25-dimensional hyperplaquette a vertex .",
    "a closed surface on the lattice is a collection of plaquettes , where at each link an even number of plaquettes meet . in @xcite a hamiltonian for closed surfaces @xmath26 on the lattice",
    "is defined in the following way :    attach plaquette variables @xmath27 to each plaquette @xmath28 of the lattice and define @xmath29 the energy of @xmath26 is given as a sum over all links @xmath30 where @xmath31 contributes @xmath32 if four plaquettes meet at the corresponding link , @xmath33 if two plaquettes meet perpendicular and zero in all other cases .",
    "note that @xmath34 is always the maximum number of plaquettes , which can meet at a link , independent of the dimension of the lattice . in terms of the link variables",
    "this can be written as @xmath35    ( 10,4.5 ) ( 5.5,1 ) ( 6.8,0.5 ) ( 6.8,4.3 ) ( 4.7,2.5 ) ( 9,2.5 )     + @xmath36 can not be chosen independently since the surface is closed .",
    "this condition requires @xmath37 to resolve this constraint , spin variables @xmath38 were attached to the sites of the dual lattice .",
    "+    ( 10,4.5 ) ( 5.5,1 ) ( 6.8,0.5 ) ( 6.8,4.3 ) ( 4.7,2.5 ) ( 9,2.5 ) ( 4.7,3.5 ) ( 9,1.6 ) ( 4.7,1.6 ) ( 9,3.5 )     + the plaquette variables can then be represented as @xmath39 and the full hamiltonian becomes equivalent to @xmath40.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression @xmath41 runs over all sites of the dual lattice , where the spins are located and @xmath42 denote unit vectors parallel to the @xmath7 cubic axes .",
    "one sees that the equivalent spin system ( [ spin - h ] ) contains ferromagnetic nearest neighbour and antiferromagnetic next nearest neighbour couplings , where the ratio between them is fixed and given by @xmath43 for arbitrary self - intersection coupling @xmath12 , the energy contribution of a link , where four plaquettes meet is equal to @xmath44 . in this case equation ( [ hlink ] ) must be replaced by @xmath45 and the corresponding spin - hamiltonian becomes @xmath46.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this hamiltonian also contains a plaquette term as long as @xmath47 .    because in ( [ plaquette_rep ] ) the plaquette variables were represented as products of nearest neighbour spins , we can restore the original surface @xmath26 from the spin configuration by simply choosing all plaquettes between spins of opposite sign . in this sense",
    ", the surface @xmath26 can be considered as a domain wall , which separates spins of positive from spins of negative sign .",
    "in contrast to the ordinary ferromagnetic ising model , the energy of a spin configuration is not given by the total number of plaquettes of @xmath26 , i.e.the surface , but by @xmath48 , where @xmath10 is the number of links contained in @xmath26 , where two plaquettes meet perpendicular and @xmath11 is the number of links , where 4 plaquettes meet .",
    "because of this , one can always insert plain domain walls by swaping a whole ( @xmath8-dimensional ) spin layer without changing the total energy , provided the inserted walls do not cross any existing surface . in particular the ground state of the finite lattice system containing @xmath49 spins ( @xmath7-dimensional cubus ) is @xmath50-fold degenerate .",
    "in this section we will prove , that the model defined in the previous section shows a phase transition , provided @xmath18 .",
    "this will be done with a method which is due to peierls @xcite .",
    "the argument proceeds in two steps .",
    "( i ) we show that the spontaneous magnetization @xmath52 for a finite system with special boundary conditions is bounded from below , if the temperature is lower than a critical temperature @xmath53 , i.e.@xmath54 the hat indicates the special boundary conditions and the index @xmath55 refers to the finite system containing @xmath55 spins .",
    "@xmath56 is independent of @xmath55 , but sensitive to the special boundary conditions we impose .",
    "( ii ) the free energy @xmath57 is concave as a function of the magnetic field @xmath58 , i.e.@xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the thermodynamic limit @xmath62 exists in the sense of van hove and is independent of the boundary conditions .",
    "the limiting free energy is concave as well .",
    "this implies that equation ( [ concav ] ) remains valid in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "since the magnetization is antisymmetric in @xmath58 , it follows that @xmath63 is not analytic in @xmath64 if @xmath60 .",
    "to get an idea how equation ( [ magnetization ] ) can be shown , consider a 3-dimensional finite volume with @xmath55 spins and fix the spins at the boundary to + 1 .",
    "the ground state of this system is given by the spin configuration , in which all spins are positive , since then no domain walls are present and hence the total energy is zero .",
    "if we now swap a little ` island ' of spins inside the volume to -1 , we need an amount of energy @xmath65 , which is essential proportional to the total number of edge elements of the domain wall , which was established by swaping the spins .",
    "therefore , the probability of occurrence of a domain wall with @xmath66 edge elements is of order @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the total number of possible edge configurations with @xmath66 edge elements .",
    "now for @xmath69 , the total number of negative spins inside a domain wall is bounded by @xmath70 ( volume of a cube ) , hence the mean number of negative spins will be bounded by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is some constant . if @xmath68 does not increase too rapidly for increasing @xmath66 , the right hand side of ( [ p1 ] ) will be smaller than @xmath73 for large enough @xmath74 .",
    "thus the spontaneous magnetisation will be strictly non zero , if @xmath74 .",
    "the argument can easily be extended to @xmath18 , if @xmath70 is replaced by @xmath75 .",
    "it does not work in two dimensions , since in this case , the edge elements are vertices and the total number of negative spins inside a domain wall with a given number of vertices can be arbitrary large . indeed , in two dimensions , the model does not seem to show a phase transition @xcite .",
    "we now proceed with the details for the case @xmath14 .",
    "consider a finite volume of the dual lattice containing @xmath55 spins in its interior @xmath76 and fix the spins at the boundary : @xmath77 if a certain configuration @xmath78 of the @xmath55 spins is given we denote by @xmath79$}}$ ] the corresponding closed surface on the original lattice which separates regions of negative from regions of positive spins .",
    "we call a link contained in @xmath79$}}$ ] an edge element , if one of the following two conditions is fulfilled :    * four plaquettes of @xmath79$}}$ ] meet at the given link . *",
    "two plaquettes of @xmath79$}}$ ] meet perpendicular at the given link .",
    "the set @xmath80 of all edge elements of @xmath79$}}$ ] can be divided into connected edge diagrams @xmath81 in a unique way @xmath82 the energy @xmath83$}}$ ] of the spin configuration can then easily be expressed in terms of connected edge diagrams since @xmath79$}}$ ] is the original interacting surface and therefore only the edge elements of @xmath79$}}$ ] contribute to @xmath83$}}$ ] .",
    "we define the energy contribution @xmath84 $ ] of a connected edge diagram @xmath72 as @xmath85=j(l_{2}+4\\,l_{4}),\\ ] ] where @xmath10 denotes the number of edge elements of @xmath72 , where two plaquettes meet and @xmath11 the number of edge elements , where four plaquettes meet .",
    "the total energy of a spin configuration can then be written as @xmath86$}}=\\sum_{c}e\\left[\\:\\!c\\right].\\ ] ] clearly , the number of all connected edge diagrams with a given energy contribution @xmath65 that fit into the finite volume @xmath87 is finite .",

    "the connected edge diagram @xmath90 belongs to a domain wall , which encloses a certain number of spins . by reversing all these spins",

    "we get an upper bound for the thermodynamical expectation value of @xmath107$}}$ ] : @xmath109 note that the right hand side of ( [ nminus ] ) is not defined for @xmath110 . to proceed with the argument",
    ", we need an upper bound for @xmath88 .",
    "consider the following construction method , which can be used to build up every possible diagram :    * first we number all the vertices ( @xmath25-dimensional hyperplaquettes ) of the lattice and keep this numbering once for all fixed .",
    "* next we choose one of the @xmath55 lattice points and attach 3 edge elements , pointing in three given directions .",
    "for example if @xmath111 denotes the chosen point , we can attach the edge elements + @xmath112 , + @xmath113 , + @xmath114 , + @xmath115 .",
    "this can be done since such an edge configuration must occur at least once in any possible connected edge diagram .",
    "we think of this vertex as a corner of the closed surface .",
    "this fixes the 8 spins surrounding the vertex @xmath116 . *",
    "imagine that a connected subdiagram exists already .",
    "now we choose the vertex with the lowest number , which occurs in the construction so far , i.e.  where at least one edge element ends and where the configuration of the edge elements surrounding this vertex has not been specified yet .",
    "next we do this specification by choosing the values of not more than four of the eight spins , surrounding the vertex , since we know that at least one edge element ends at this vertex already . * finally by repeating construction step 3 .",
    ", all possible connected edge diagrams can be constructed .    to find an upper bound for @xmath88 , we estimate the maximum number of possible outcomes of the construction procedure just given .",
    "if the considered finite lattice volume contains @xmath55 spins , we have @xmath55 choices for construction step 2 . each time we perform",
    "construction step 3 , we have different numbers of choices how to specify the remaining spins .",
    "this depends on how many edge elements and what kind of edge elements are already ending at the vertex under consideration .",
    "the maximum number of choices arises , if just one edge element , surrounded by two or four plaquettes , is already present at the vertex , leaving four spins to specify , i.e.  16 possibilities .",
    "these possibilities are shown in figure 1 , together with the corresponding energy contribution of the specified vertex .",
    "edge elements where two plaquettes meet are indicated by a simple edge .",
    "edge elements , where four plaquettes meet are indicated as double edges .",
    "the left column shows all cases , where one simple edge coming from the left was already present and correspondingly the right column shows all cases , where one double edge coming from the left was already present . from this picture we read of the maximum numbers of choices @xmath117 , how to specify the spins , such that a vertex of energy @xmath65 arises : +    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "+    the function @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is defined by @xmath120 can now be interpreted as a generating function which counts the number of all connected edge diagrams with energy @xmath65 at least once , which can be constructed by repeating construction step 3 @xmath121-times , i.e.  the coefficient of @xmath122 in an expansion of @xmath123 is an upper bound for the number of those diagrams .",
    "since all edge elements were counted @xmath124 times , we have to calculate the coefficient of @xmath122 and not simply @xmath125 .",
    "summing @xmath123 over all possible numbers of steps @xmath126 we get a generation function , which counts all connected edge diagrams at least once .",
    "therefore @xmath127 provides an upper bound for @xmath88 .",
    "we can write @xmath128 as @xmath129 putting this expression in equation ( [ bound1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath130 if we denote the smallest @xmath131 by @xmath132 , which clearly dominates the increase of @xmath88 for large @xmath65 , we can further approximate this expression as follows : @xmath133 where @xmath134 substituting this result into equation ( [ nminus ] ) , we find an upper bound for the density of negative spins : @xmath135 this inequality remains valid in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "the sum on the right hand side converges , if @xmath136 is larger than @xmath137ln(c ) and approaches zero , if @xmath136 goes to infinity .",
    "therefore for @xmath74 , it will be smaller than @xmath138 , which implies a non zero spontaneous magnetisation .",
    "this proves the existence of a phase transition .",
    "equation ( [ nminus ] ) together with an upper bound for @xmath88 given in ( [ bound2 ] ) also provides a lower bound for the critical temperature @xmath53 .",
    "we find @xmath139 the value for @xmath69 is in agreement with the critical temperature found in @xcite , which was @xmath140    the method used above to prove the existence of an ordered low temperature phase for @xmath14 can easily be generalized to arbitrary @xmath141 , where @xmath142 .",
    "we have @xmath143 therefore equation ( [ nminus ] ) remains unchanged if @xmath144 , whereas in case @xmath145 we have to replace it by @xmath146 an upper bound for @xmath88 can be found by expanding the generating function @xmath147 @xmath148 in powers of @xmath149 , i.e. @xmath150 from this we obtain @xmath151 the estimate for @xmath88 becomes smaller for increasing @xmath17 and diverges for @xmath152 .",
    "for @xmath153 the behaviour of @xmath88 for large @xmath65 is dominated by the smallest zero of the function @xmath154 , which gives @xmath155",
    "we have proven the existence of an ordered low temperature phase for the spin systems defined in section 2 , which can be considered as the lattice regularization of the gonihedric string .",
    "each spin configuration corresponds to a particular random surface which is simply the domain wall separating regions of spin with opposite sign .",
    "this observation was crucial , since it allowed us to apply peierls contour method .",
    "however the naive application of the argument would yield an inequality of the following form in @xmath69 dimensions : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the expectation value of the number of negative spins , calculated for the finite system with boundary condition @xmath158 .",
    "the factor @xmath159 is the maximum number of negative spins that a closed surface with @xmath160 plaquettes can enclose and @xmath161 denotes the number of closed surfaces with @xmath160 plaquettes .",
    "this number is known to grow exponentially , in fact @xmath162 for @xmath163 we have to put the minimum energy of a closed domain wall with @xmath160 plaquettes which is @xmath164 this shows , that the right hand side of ( [ naiv ] ) actually diverges for every @xmath136 due to the exponential growth of @xmath161 .",
    "we therefore had to modify the argument as discussed in section 3 .",
    "this was possible since the energy of a closed surface is essentially proportional to the number @xmath66 of edges and the number of negative spins inside is bounded by @xmath70 . instead of ( [ naiv ] ) we arrived at @xmath146 for @xmath165 and @xmath166 for @xmath144 .",
    "finally we proved that the number of connected edge diagrams with given energy @xmath88 does not grow faster than exponentially for any @xmath12 .",
    "as pointed out before , the argument does not work in two dimensions , because in this case the ( @xmath167-dimensional ) edges are not connected and therefore do not give a restriction for the number of negative spins .",
