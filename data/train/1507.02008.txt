    "it was first predicted by bruno pontecorvo in 1957 that if neutrinos are massive the neutrino flavor should be unstable , that is called neutrino ( flavor ) oscillations @xcite .",
    "briefly put , neutrino oscillation is a phenomenon that a neutrino produced in a definite flavor is observed in a different flavor after traveling some distances . in other words , neutrinos are able to oscillate among the three available flavors while they propagate through space .",
    "nowadays there are compelling evidences for neutrino oscillations from a variety of experimental data on solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrinos .",
    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations implies that neutrinos have small but non - zero masses , with at least two species being non - relativistic today .",
    "however , the present experimental results on neutrino oscillations only measure the difference of two squared masses , such as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , but give no hint on their absolute mass scales .",

    "for example , in the framework of one - parameter extensions to the base @xmath11cdm model the planck 2015 results @xcite give 95% upper limits on the sum of neutrino masses , i.e. , @xmath33 ev for a combination of planck tt+lowp+lensing+ext , and @xmath34 ev for planck tt , te , ee+lowp+lensing , where `` tt '' denotes the combination of the tt likelihood at multipoles @xmath35 and a low-_l _ temperature - only likelihood , `` te '' denotes the likelihood at @xmath35 using te spectra , and `` ee''denotes the likelihood at @xmath35 using ee spectra,``lowp '' denotes the low-_l _ planck polarization data , `` lensing '' is the planck lensing data , and `` ext '' represents the external data including the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , and @xmath36 . in @xcite , the power law and exponential types of viable @xmath37 theories along with massive neutrinos are studied .",

    "peebles and ratra   proposed a scalar field that is slowly rolling down with a potential @xmath59 at a large @xmath0 , where @xmath60 and @xmath4 are nonnegative parameters .",
    "this inverse power - law potential can not only lead to the late - time acceleration of the universe but also partially solve the cosmological constant problems .",

    "what is more , the parameter @xmath60 depends on @xmath4 ( see @xcite for its dependence on @xmath4 ) .",
    "the friedmann equation of the @xmath0cdm model with massive neutrinos can be written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66and @xmath67 denote the energy densities of baryons , cold dark matter ( cdm ) , scalar field dark energy , photons and neutrinos , and @xmath68 is the hubble parameter .",

    "an ap measurement is carried out by comparing the observed transverse and radial dimensions of objects . while the ap test is equally valid for an isotropic process such as the two - point statistics of galaxy clustering .",
    "the apparent anisotropy of the two - dimensional correlation function of galaxies mainly arises from the geometry and expansion of the universe which should be correctly embodied in the fiducial cosmological model , and the rsd effect which is supposed to be marginalized by using appropriate rsd model ( see @xcite for a recent review of rsd models ) .",
