    "recent technological advances in manufacturing almost ballistic semiconductors of mesoscopic size ( two dimensional electron gas , 2deg ) coupled to a superconductor has initiated a growing interest in considering the phase - coherent transport and the excitation spectrum in hybrid superconducting nanostructures . in these systems",
    "the electron can coherently evolve into a hole ( and vice versa ) at the interface between the semiconductor and the superconductor .",
    "this mechanism had been discovered by andreev@xcite .",
    "classically , the particle momentum is conserved and the hole is reflected back in the same direction as the incoming electron . this scattering process is known as retro - reflection or andreev reflection .",
    "the overview of the recent progress in this field can be found in several works@xcite .",
    "the andreev scattering resulting in a discrete spectrum of single - particle excitations of a layer of normal metal in contact with superconductors on both sides was first discussed by andreev@xcite .",
    "based on the bogoliubov - de gennes equation@xcite ( bdg ) the excitation spectrum ( andreev states ) of a normal metal ( n ) attached to a superconductor ( s ) was first considered by p.  g.  de  gennes and d.  saint - james @xcite .",
    "a ballistic normal metal weakly coupled to a superconductor is commonly called an andreev billiard .",
    "such systems have been extensively studied over the past ten years @xcite .",
    "the bound states were studied e.g. for sns junctions@xcite .",
    "a semi - infinite n region in contact with a semi - infinite s region in a strong magnetic field was investigated by hoppe et al .",
    "@xcite    the excitation spectrum of andreev billiards depends on whether the n region is classically chaotic or integrable@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a gap opens in the spectrum for chaotic billiards , while for integrable billiards the spectrum is most likely to be gapless@xcite . in these works the spectrum was calculated only close to the fermi level .",
    "however , the spectrum shows interesting features throughout the entire energy range below the superconducting gap . the excitation spectrum is determined in this paper for two specific andreev billiards , namely the ns box and disk systems . in ns box systems",
    "a rectangular n region is in contact with the superconductor , while the ns disk system consists of a circular s region surrounded concentrically by a circular n region .",
    "both systems are integrable and , in accordance with earlier findings , the density of states ( dos ) is gapless .",
    "we shall show , however , that for higher energies the dos has singularities located at equal distances from each other .",
    "one of the central issues in this paper is the investigation of these singularities in the dos .",
    "we calculate the spectra of these systems exactly by solving the bdg equations , taking into account the non - perfect interface ( mismatch in the fermi wave numbers and the effective masses of the normal metal and the superconductor , and tunnel barrier at the interface ) . for a narrow ns junction",
    "it is justified @xcite that the pairing potential can be approximated by a step - like function ( zero in the n region and some constant value in the s region ) .",
    "note that the two systems have the common feature that the bdg equation is separable and one of the separated wave function sets ( ` transverse modes ' ) is the same in the n and the s region .",
    "the exact quantization condition can be very simply expressed in terms of a phase @xmath0 which is shown to be related to the classical action of an electron moving inside the n region between two successive bounces at the ns interface ( see eq .",
    "( [ phi_m ] ) ) .",
    "several authors @xcite have already derived the bohr - sommerfeld approximation for the density of states .",
    "the dos can be written in terms of the probability distribution @xmath1 of the classical path length @xmath2 between two subsequent bounces of the electron at the ns interface .",
    "starting from our exact quantization condition expressed in terms of the phase @xmath0 we re - derive the commonly used bohr - sommerfeld approximation@xcite of the dos in the case of ns box and disk systems .",
    "moreover , we give an analytical expression for the probability @xmath1 in terms of the phase @xmath0 .",
    "it is shown that , in the framework of bohr - sommerfeld quantization , the singularity of the dos is a direct consequence of the singular behavior of @xmath1 . using the expression for @xmath1 we can reproduce the counting function very accurately in the entire range of the spectrum and locate the singularities of the dos for ns box and disk systems .",
    "the probability @xmath1 depends on the geometry of the n region and the location of the ns interface .",
    "we shall show that from a semiclassical point of view some special trajectories of the electron play crucial roles in the singular character of the dos . based on our semiclassical analysis a simple formula",
    "is given for the location of these singularities .",
    "this formula gives an excellent agreement with our numerically exact calculation of the spectrum .",
    "furthermore , it predicts very accurately the number of the singularities and their location in the system studied by de gennes et al .",
    "@xcite we propose an explanation , based on our theory about the singularities , for the pronounced peaks found by ihra et al .",
    "@xcite ( for ns systems ) in their numerical calculations of the dos .",
    "we believe that the singularities found by lodder and nazarov@xcite ( for andreev billiards ) , and ipr et al .",
    "@xcite ( for sns systems ) are related to some special classical trajectories of the electron for which the probability @xmath1 is singular .",
    "the other issue studied in this paper is the weyl formula for our ns systems . in the quantization of a normal billiard ,",
    "the counting function @xmath3 gives the number of levels whose energy is less than or equal to @xmath4 .",
    "the smooth part of the counting function @xmath3 is given by the weyl formula@xcite , which has already been calculated for billiards of various shapes .",
    "we present a new weyl formula for our ns box and disk systems .",
    "as expected , the counting function obtained from the exact ( numerical ) calculations ` oscillates ' around the curve given by our weyl formula .",
    "our exact quantum mechanical results reveal a more complex energy level structure for ns disk systems than for box systems .",
    "semiclassically , two kinds of modes exist in the disk geometry .",
    "first , the electron can hit the superconductor undergoing an andreev reflection ( hereafter called andreev states ) , and second , the electron trajectory may not reach the superconductor ( hereafter called whispering gallery modes ) .",
    "the two modes play crucial roles in the energy levels of the system .",
    "contrary to ns box systems where the dos is proportional to the energy close the fermi level , in the case of ns disk systems it is constant due to the whispering gallery modes . in studying the spectrum of the disk geometry ,",
    "we have been motivated by bruder and imry s recent work@xcite .",
    "based on whispering gallery modes , they proposed a physical picture to interpret the significant paramagnetic effect observed in recent experiments@xcite",
    ". thus , a careful analysis of andereev and whispering gallery states as presented in this paper and the inclusion of the flux induced phase may shed further light on the issue raised by bruder and imry@xcite .",
    "our work on this problem is in progress .",
    "we also found that , depending on the parameters of the ns disk system , the spectra can belong to either of three classes : ( a ) ` mixed phase ' , in which andreev states coexist with whispering gallery modes and the energy dependent coherence length @xmath5 in the superconductor is much less than the radius @xmath6 of the s region , while the dos is singular ; ( b ) the opposite case , i.e.  @xmath7 when the spectrum is identical to that of a normal billiard whose radius is that of the outer circle ; ( c ) when @xmath8 is order of one ( here @xmath9 is the fermi wave number ) or the ns interface is not perfect , and so the energy spectrum corresponds to that of an annular billiard ( the circular s region is cut out ) .",
    "it turns out that there are two relevant parameters to make this classification , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . using these parameters we sketch a so - called ` phase diagram ' for the three above classes .",
    "it was reported in the works on the paramagnetic effect@xcite that the coherence length exceeds the size of the superconducting region .",
    "thus , according to our phase diagram it is possible that the whole ns disk system behaves as a full normal disk",
    ". then a larger paramagnetic effect can be expected than that predicted by bruder and imry who included only the whispering gallery states . however ,",
    "further work is necessary to clarify this scenario .",

    ", we found that for @xmath270 the ns disk system behaves as a normal full disk , while in the opposite case the energy levels of the system have a ` mixed phase ' character , in which andreev states and whispering gallery states coexist ( see sec .",

    "we shall call the first case a ` full disk phase ' ( fd ) . according to our numerical results , it is safe to say that the mp and fd can be distinguished very well by the ratio @xmath271 .",

    "equation ( [ phi_m ] ) is a central result and serves as a starting point for further theoretical studies in this paper . using this quantization condition ( a ) we derived for both ns systems with perfect interfaces a weyl formula for the counting function , ( b ) by re - deriving the commonly used bohr - sommerfeld approximation to the dos we presented an explicit expression for the probability @xmath1 in terms of the classical action of the electron moving in the n region between two successive bounces at the ns interface .",
    "the numerically exact calculations are in very good agreement with our weyl formula and the bohr - sommerfeld approximation .",
    "the singularities in the dos obtained from our exact calculations can be successfully explained by using the correct probability function @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 is a singular function of @xmath2 both for ns box and disk systems . according to our theory concerning the singularities",

    "we demonstrated that it can be applied for the system studied by de gennes et al .",
    "@xcite , and it may as well give the reason for the significant peaks observed by ihra et al .",
    "@xcite in their numerical calculations .",
    "we show that the singularities in @xmath1 are related to some special classical trajectories of the electron moving in the n region hitting the ns interface .    in the case of ns disk systems",
    "the dos is constant as the energy gets close to the fermi level .",
    "this is , at first sight , in contrast to the common belief that for integrable billiards the dos should go to zero as the energy tends the fermi level .",
    "we pointed out that in this ns disk system the whispering gallery states give the non - vanishing dos at the fermi level .",
    "however , the andreev states still have no contribution to the dos . in the disk system the andreev and the whispering gallery states coexist ( so - called mixed phase ) . depending on the geometry of the disk and the material parameters",
    ", we sketch a kind of phase diagram to classify the energy spectra into three classes : ( i ) mixed phase , ( ii ) full disk , ( iii ) annular disk .",
    "if the coherence length is much larger than the diameter of the superconducting region , the spectrum corresponds to the full disk phase .",
    "the electrons travel thorough the s region without andreev reflection .",
    "when the andreev approximation fails , the normal reflection is enhanced at the ns interface and the system behaves as an annular circular billiard .",
    "this is also the case when there is a tunnel barrier at the ns interface or a mismatch between the effective masses and the fermi wave numbers of the normal and superconducting regions .",
    "an interesting extension of the study presented in this paper may be the investigation of the role that the geometry of the normal billiard plays in the singularities of the dos . under",
    "what conditions do such singularities exist ? does the energy spectrum at higher energies show some special structure in chaotic billiards ? how can the weyl formula ( derived for ns box and disk systems ) be extended for other integrable and chaotic billiards ?",
    "our quantization method can also be applied for ns disk in the presence of a magnetic field . in this case , besides andreev states and whispering gallery states ( more specifically edge states ) one has to take into account the landau levels that appear in the spectrum in the presence of strong magnetic fields .",
    "these give rise to a much more complex energy spectrum than a zero magnetic field .",
