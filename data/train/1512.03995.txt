    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , one of the most luminous stellar explosion , could explode within a similar mechanism : complete explosive destruction of carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( c - o wd ) reaching the chandrasekhar mass limit ( i.e. , @xmath81.4 m@xmath9 for the c - o wd without rotation ) , most likely via accretion in a binary system , although other channels have been proposed ( see e.g. , the review by @xcite ) .",
    "they show strikingly similar photometric and spectroscopic behavior in optical ( i.e. , @xcite ) , and the remaining scatter can be better understood in terms of an empirical relation between light - curve width ( i.e. , @xmath1m@xmath2(b ) ) and luminosity ( i.e. , width - luminosity relation [ wlr ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "based on that relation , sne ia have been successfully applied as luminosity distance indicators for measuring the expansion history of the universe @xcite .",
    "observationally , sne ia could be divided into several different subclasses according to their spectral characteristics @xcite .",
    "for example , sn 1991 t @xcite is spectroscopically different from the bulk of sneia , lying at the luminous end of luminosity distribution .",
    "its featureless spectra at early phase are characterized by appearances of strong fe  iii  lines and weak or absent lines of intermediate - mass elements ( imes , e.g. , si  ii , s  ii  and ca  ii ) which are usually strong in the spectra of normal sne ia .",
    "it had a slowly declining light curve ( e.g. , @xmath10(b ) = 0.94 , @xcite ) and is @xmath80.6 mag more luminous than normal ones @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that sn1991 t is indistinguishable from normal sneia in luminosity .",
    "@xcite also showed that sn 1991 t fits in the wlr and that its peculiarities are only spectroscopic . through modeling of a series of early spectra",
    ", @xcite found that the absence of fe  ii , si  ii , and ca  ii  lines and the presence of strong fe  iii  lines are due to the low abundance of imes and the high ionization caused by the high luminosity .",
    "superluminous sne  ia such as 2003fg @xcite , 2006gz @xcite , 2007if @xcite and 2009dc @xcite are called super - chandrasekhar ( sc ) snia candidates .",
    "these sne  ia are required to have progenitor masses exceeding the chandrasekhar - mass limit if their luminosities are entirely attributed to the radioactive decay of @xmath6ni .    in this paper",
    ", we present observations of sn 2011hr ( r.a.=@xmath11.03 , decl.=@xmath123216.1 ) which was discovered on ut nov . 8.54 2011 (",
    "ut time is used throughout this paper ) by the katzman automatic imaging telescope , lick observatory , usa @xcite .",
    "the supernova is located 3.4  west and 3.7 north of the centre of ngc 2691 , which is equivalent to a projected distance @xmath81.5 kpc using the distance of the host adopted in this paper ( i.e. , d@xmath1360.0 mpc ) .",
    "two days after the discovery , an optical spectrum was taken with the li - jiang 0.8 m telescope ( hereafter is ljt ) of yunnan observatories ( ynao ) , china , showing that it was a young sn1991t - like sn ia at about ten days before the maximum light , with prominent iron lines in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "a follow - up photometric and spectroscopic observing campaign was immediately established for sn2011hr .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "photometric observations and data reductions are described in section [ sect : ph ] , where the light and color curves are investigated .",
    "section [ sect : sp ] presents the spectroscopic observations . in section [",
    "sect : discu ] we derive the bolometric luminosity and the mass of @xmath6ni  synthesized in the explosion , and model the early - time spectra using abundance tomography .",

    "the photometric observations of sn 2011hr were performed in broad @xmath16 bands with the tsinghua - naoc 0.8 m telescope ( hereinafter tnt , @xcite ) at xing - long observatory of naoc .",
    "this telescope is equipped with a 1340@xmath171300 ccd ( pi versarray : 1300b ) , providing a field - of - view ( fov ) of @xmath18 with a spatial resolution of @xmath80@xmath19.52 pixel@xmath20 .",
    "the typical exposure times are 180s in the bvri bands and 300s in the u band when taking images of sn 2011hr .",
    "these images have typical full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of about 2@xmath19.5 .",
    "the ccd images were reduced using standard iraf routines .",
    "the data collections started from @xmath21 days and lasted until @xmath22 days relative to the @xmath23 band maximum light .",
    "all ccd images were reduced using the iraf standard procedure .",
    "since sn2011hr exploded near the center of its host galaxy , the step of subtracting the galaxy template from the sn images is necessary for accurate photometry , in particular when the sn became faint and/or the images were taken under poor seeing conditions .",
    "higher quality template images were obtained with the tnt on may 11 , 2013 , when the sn was sufficiently faint . using the galaxy - subtracted images , we measured the instrumental magnitudes of the sn and the local standard stars ( labeled in figure [ < img > ] ) by aperture photometry , performed using the iraf daophot package ( stetson 1987 ) . the radius for the photometric aperture is set as 2.0 times the fwhm ; the sky background light was determined from the median counts at a radius that is 5.0 times the fwhm .",
    "twelve local standard stars in the field of sn 2011hr are labeled in figure [ < img > ] .",
    "we transformed the instrumental magnitudes of these reference stars to the standard johnson @xmath24 @xcite and kron - cousins @xmath25 @xcite systems through the following transforming equations @xcite :    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    where @xmath16 represent the magnitudes in the standard system and @xmath31 represent the instrumental magnitudes .",
    "the color term coefficient was determined by observing @xcite standards on photometric nights .",

    "the reddening due to the host galaxy can be estimated by several empirical methods .",

    "the observed peak b @xmath35 v color is 0.23@xmath30.04 mag , which suggests a host - galaxy reddening of e(b - v ) = 0.32@xmath30.06 mag .",

    "combining the results from both photometry and na  i  d  absorption , a host - galaxy reddening of @xmath53 = 0.25@xmath30.10 can be obtained for sn 2011hr . on the other hand , the spectral modeling presented in section [ subsect : spmo ] suggests a moderate host - galaxy reddening , i.e. , @xmath53 = 0.15 mag , which seems to be more reasonable as it matches the observed colors .",
    "therefore , a mean value @xmath55 mag is adopted as the total reddening of sn 2011hr in this paper .",
    "the actual luminosity of sn 2011hr is affected by the uncertainty in the distance to the sn .",
    "table [ tab : disct ] lists the measurements obtained using different methods .",
    "one can see that these measurements show significant dispersion .",
    "for example , the distance derived from the redshift of the host galaxy ngc 2691 and the hubble flow is 59.3@xmath34.0 mpc @xcite , which agrees with the result from the tully - fisher relation ( 60.2@xmath310.0 mpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "these two values are larger than the luminosity distance derived for the sn using the original @xcite relation but is close to that derived from the modified relation for 91t - like events in @xcite , as listed in table [ tab : disct ] .    on the other hand",
    ", we can also estimate the distance to sn 2011hr based on its near - infrared ( nir ) magnitude , since the @xmath56band luminosities of sne ia are relatively insensitive to the reddening and are more uniform around the peak compared to the corresponding values in the optical bands @xcite . additionally , some peculiar sne ia like sne 1999aa , 1999ac , and 1999aw are found to have normal luminosities in the nir bands @xcite , though they appear somewhat peculiar in optical bands . based on the nir photometry of 13 sne ia ( including sn 2011hr ) , @xcite estimated their mean absolute peak magnitude as @xmath57 mag in the @xmath58 band .",

    "we have presented extensive observations and studies of the luminous ( e.g. , @xmath106(b ) = @xmath107 mag ) , spectroscopically peculiar type ia supernova sn 2011hr .",
    "it exhibits light curve evolution that is similar to sn 1991 t , with a post2.4 maximum decline rate @xmath10(b)=0.92@xmath30.03 mag .",
    "the spectra of sn 2011hr are characterized by strong fe - group lines and weak absorptions of imes , showing close resemblances to that of sn 2007if at all phases .",
    "note , however , that the absence of c  ii   absorption in the early - time spectra of sn 2011hr suggests that there should be difference between these two sne ia .",
    "moreover , sn2011hr has narrower light curve peaks and its light - curves decline more rapidly at late phases compared to sn 2007if .",
    "overall , sn 2011hr shows more similarities with sn 1991 t in morphology of the light curves , while it bears more common features with sn 2007if in the spectral evolution .    computing the detailed abundance distribution of the imes and iron - group elements helps further reveal the nature of this peculiar sn ia .",
    "mapping the abundances in the outer ejecta with the abundance tomography method we found that a lower mass of imes ( i.e. , 0.07 @xmath108 ) and a larger mass of @xmath6ni   ( i.e. , @xmath8  0.94 @xmath108 by spectral modeling or @xmath8  1.11 @xmath108 by arnett law ) can be inferred for sn 2011hr .",
    "the corresponding values inferred for sn1991 t is @xmath8 0.18 @xmath108 for imes and @xmath80.78 @xmath108 for @xmath6ni .",
    "our models suggest that a very efficiently burned chandrasekhar - mass progenitor is the favoured scenario for this overluminous sn ia .",
    "the weaker absorptions of the imes might indicate a lower abundance of these elements in the outer ejecta .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of similar features in sn2011hr and sn2007if may indicate that sn2011hr represents a transitional object linking 91t - like sne ia to some superluminous sneia .",
