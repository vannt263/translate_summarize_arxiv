    "we are motivated to explore this signal because of its narrow resonance over a smoothly falling background . despite the enormous background and the somewhat low number of expected events ,",
    "this decay channel is extremely relevant to the favored , low - mass higgs search as long as the resolution of the peak can be measured with reasonable resolution .",
    "our background can be categorized in two components : irreducible and reducible .",
    "irreducible background is more difficult to eliminate because these are events which have two real photons in them .",
    "reducible background events are typically poorly reconstructions electrons or jets which are mistakenly taken to be photons . in the final selection invariant mass plot (  figure  [ mgg ] )",
    "one can see the various components from each .",
    "cms is a general purpose detector .",
    "it is designed to detect and reconstruct numerous physics objects ( e.g. photons , electrons , muons , hadronic jets , etc ) . from this general design",
    "we are compatible of seeking out new physics ( e.g. higgs and susy ) . below (  figure  [ cms_xsec ] )",
    "is a cross sectional schematic of the detectored with the relevant components highlighted ( i.e. the trackers and the electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) ) .",
    "the ecal is made of @xmath176k @xmath2 crystals in the barrel ( @xmath3 ) and the endcap ( @xmath4 ) of cms .",
    "it was reconstructed in order to determine the energy of photons and electrons to high precision .",
    "the design resolution of unconverted photons in the barrel with energy greater than 100 gev was @xmath10.5%    there are two main critical issues that impact the resolution that cms is able to determine .",
    "one is the calibration of the crystals .",
    "two techniques , which are exploited , are @xmath5 events for inter - crystal calibration and @xmath6 for global energy scale calibration .",
    "the other critical issue is transparency corrections for radiation damage .",
    "an integrated laser system measures the transparency of crystals and that information is used to correct the transparency loss .",
    "below is a schematic of the ecal (  figure  [ ecal_sch ] ) and a photo of one of the crystals (  figure  [ ecal_cry ] ) .",
    "photon identification is important for removal of reducible background . the primary tools used to distinguish between signal and background are isolation , cluster shape and electron veto .",
    "the cuts set in these photon identification variables are set separately for in categories defined by the photon being in the barrel or one of the endcaps and by whether or not the photon converted to an electron - positron before before reaching the ecal .",
    "the efficiency versus @xmath7 is plotted below for these four categories (  figure  [ mc_eff ] ) .",
    "also , note that our selection contains minimum thresholds on the transverse momentum of the two photons ( 40 and 30 gev ) .     with simulated higgs photons.,width=302 ]      in our data , numerous proton - proton interactions occur each time bunches of protons pass through each other .",
    "if the wrong vertex is chosen to reconstruct the photons then the energy of the photons and the mass of the di - photon will be incorrect . effectively smearing the mass of the higgs signal .",
    "we use the following quantities to increase our probability of determining the correct vertex .",
    "for unconverted photons we use @xmath8 , projection of tracks onto @xmath9 and the balance between @xmath9 and vertex s tracks . for converted @xmath10 s",
    "the conversion - tracks are used to point back to vertex .",
    "the efficiency of this method is plotted below as a function of di - photon transverse momentum (  figure  [ vertex_eff ] ) .",
    "making the basic assumption that electrons and photons have similar shower properties we use the tag and probe method with @xmath6 electrons to determine the efficiency of our photon selection .",
    "first events with robustly identified electrons are selected and we seek an additional electron passing a minimal transverse energy requirement , the probe .",
    "the photon reconstructed with the same energy deposit has the photon cuts applied to it and efficiency of passing events to selected events is measured in each category .",
    "below is a table of these efficiencies .",
    "please note the majority of our photons are in the unconverted , barrel category , which is more than 90% efficient .    to measure the efficiency of the electron veto cuts , photons from @xmath11 events have",
