    "we use a quantum optical implementation that combines elements that have been experimentally realized or can be expected to be realized in the near future . for example , significant process has been reported in experimental quantum optics with trapped ions and in cavity qed , both in the optical and in the microwave regime ( nobel symposium 1997 ) .",

( 200,70 ) ( 0,0 )    the optical cavity - fiber system , together with the laser pulses constitutes what we abstractly call a _ noisy quantum channel_. before we talk about noise processes in more detail , let us briefly discuss the ideal situation .    ideally , the scheme realizes the following transmission @xmath0|0\\rangle_b    \\longrightarrow    |0\\rangle_a\\big[\\chi_0|0\\rangle_b+\\chi_1|1\\rangle_b\\big ] \\label{swap}\\ ] ] where an unknown superposition of internal states @xmath1 and @xmath2 in atom @xmath3 in the first cavity is transferred to atom @xmath4 in the second cavity .",
    "the cavities may be part of a larger network , so we often refer to them as node a and node b , respectively .",
    "the selected internal states @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the atoms define , in the language of quantum information theory , the ` computational basis ' for the qubit .",
    "it is important to realize that the atom @xmath3 may be entangled to other atoms in the same cavity or at other nodes of the network . in that situation ,",

    "the second arrow transfers the state of @xmath8 to @xmath4 , thereby transfering the entanglement between the atoms @xmath3 and @xmath8 to an entanglement between atoms @xmath3 and @xmath4 . at the end of this composite transformation , the state of the auxiliary atom @xmath8 is the same as initially and",
    "_ factors out_. for @xmath9 , an ideal epr pair is created .    from this simple consideration",
    "we conclude : the creation of a distant epr pair is possible if 1 .  the local cnot operation and 2 .",
    "the transfer operation ( [ swap ] ) can be realized without errors , or if these errors can be corrected .",
    "corresponding to these operations , two different kinds of errors need to be corrected : 1 .",
    "local ( gate ) errors , 2 .",
    "transfer errors .",
    "when the photons are sent along optical fibers , then photoabsorption will be a dominant transfer error .",
    "losses may also occur by incoherent scattering on the surface of the cavity mirrors and at the coupling segments between the cavities and the fiber .",
    "another typical transfer error will be caused by imperfectly designed laser pulses for the raman transition .",
    "an example for a local gate error is spontaneous emission in one of the atoms during the gate operation .    in this paper",
    ", we will assume that local gate operations can be performed without errors , and concentrate on errors that occur during the photon transfer .",
    "a discussion of error correction for 2-bit gate operations can be found in the paper by van enk _ et al . _",
    "( 1997c ) .",
    "in a realistic model , we have to consider the possibility that the transfer of the atomic state from cavity a to b is imperfect .",
    "there is a certain probability that the atom in b will not be excited , even though a was excited .",
    "this is due to the interaction of the compound atom - cavity - fiber system with the environment which , even if small , in principle always exists .",
    "this results in an entanglement of the atomic states in ( [ swap ] ) with the environment , i.e. the cavity walls , the fiber , and the radiation field of the free space .    in the following",
    ", we assume that photons can be absorbed but not created by the channel .",
    "this is a very good approximation for optical photons , where the mean thermal number of photons in the cavities and the fiber is exceedingly small .",
    "in this situation , the most general expression for an imperfect transfer operation is of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 denote unnormalized states of the environment .",
    "it is expedient to write @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , thereby introducing operators that entangle the system with the environment . with this notation , ( [ swape ] ) can be expressed in the compact form @xmath15 which defines the photonic channel ( van enk _ et al . _",
    "1997b ) .    the optical cavities together with the fiber form a compound optical system with a certain resonant structure that defines its spectrum of quasi modes , its relaxation constants , etc .",
    "in the special case when only photoabsorption plays a role , the operators in ( [ photonic_channel ] ) have a simple form . for optical frequencies ,",
    "the state of the environment can be very well approximated by the vacuum state , so one can write @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , with @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the damping rate of the total ( atom-)cavity - fiber system , and @xmath21 is the transfer time . the operators @xmath22 , @xmath23 are amplitude operators of the @xmath24 th oscillator mode of the environment .",
    "more generally , the operators @xmath25 in ( [ photonic_channel ] ) may describe spontaneous emission processes , photon absorption , as well as transitions to and repumping from other internal states of the atoms .",
    "thus , all complicated physics is hidden in the three operators . in this",
    "general ( non - stationary ) situation , the time dependence of the environmental terms has to be taken into account .",
    "the operators @xmath25 then depend on the initial time when the transfer starts . as a consequence , when iterating the channel ( [ photonic_channel ] ) , the temporal ordering of the operators becomes important , e.g. @xmath26 .",

    "in particular , @xmath34 decreases exponentially with the transfer time and the corresponding length of the fiber .    in order to create an epr pair over a distance comparable or larger than the absorption length of the photonic channel , we need to find a method to _ detect and correct _ a photon loss that may occur during the transfer . loosely speaking",
    ", we are seeking to eliminate the absorption term @xmath35 in ( [ ekertt ] ) , and to minimize the other term @xmath36 .    in the following ,",
    "we outline a method that uses one resp .",
    "two auxiliary atoms in each cavity .",

    "( 1997b ) .",
    "the main idea is to entangle the atom in the first cavity with auxiliary ( backup ) atoms , before transmitting the information .",
    "this is reminiscent of a redundant coding scheme , with the fundamental difference that our scheme allows to correct errors to _ all orders _ in the photoabsorption probability . by measuring a certain joint state of two atoms in the receiver cavity ,",
    "one is able to _ detect _ a photon loss while _ maintaining _ the initial coherence of the atomic state that was sent .",
    "therefore , the transmission can be repeated as often as necessary until no error is detected .    in detail , this requires three steps:(1 ) _ encoding _ of the atomic state into a three - particle entangled state @xmath37 \\nonumber\\\\   & & +   \\chi_1\\big[|0\\rangle_a|0\\rangle_{a_2}|1\\rangle_{a_3 }            + |1\\rangle_a|1\\rangle_{a_2}|0\\rangle_{a_3 } \\big]\\ , .",

    "this allows for an iterative purification protocol ( van enk _ et al . _",
    "at each purification step , the pair is temporarily entangled with two auxiliary atoms , one at each node , using both local cnot operations and the afc . in some sense , this creates an auxiliary epr pair that is used to purify ( [ ekertse ] ) .",

    "it is quite remarkable that this describes a finite system that iteratively purifies itself .",
    "we note that standard purification protocols ( bennett _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , deutsch _",
    "_ 1996 , gisin 1996 ) , assume a large number of epr pairs which need to be coherently manipulated ( connected ) .",
    "in contrast , the present scheme uses iterated operations on _ few _ atoms .",
    "with the methods discussed in the previous sections , it is possible to create an epr pair of high fidelity by sending single photons through a dissipative and noisy channel that connects the atoms .",
    "there is , however , a limitation to the method when the transmission time through the channel becomes much larger than its relaxation time , i.e.   if @xmath63 . as the absorption probability grows exponentially with @xmath21 ,",
    "so will the required number of repetitions for one successful transmission .",
    "we have to keep in mind that in the implementation of the afc ( [ afc ] ) , we have assumed that all local operations are error free . in reality",
    ", these operations will never be perfect , but there will be small probabilities for failure . as the number of required transmissions increases , the error probabilites will eventually add up and spoil the coherence - preserving action of the afc .",
    "absorption losses are well - known in problems of electric signal transmission through classical channels where , at regularly spaced intervals , amplifiers are put in the channel . in classical ( digital ) communication technique",
    "such amplifiers are not only used to amplify but also to restore the signal .",
    "the distance between the amplifiers is then determined by ( 1 ) the damping rate of the fiber and ( 2 ) the bit rate of the transmission ( dispersion effects ) . in the classical case ,",
    "dispersion effects are more important whereas in the quantum case , when we send _ single photons _ , damping will be the main problem .    in",
    "order build up the epr correlations , single qubits ( photons ) need to be transmitted which can not be amplified ( wootters & zurek 1982 , glauber 1986 ) .",
    "all we can do here is to detect whether a photon has been absorbed and , whenever that is the case , repeat the transmission .    for any practical implementation of the scheme , it is crucial to know how the the number of operations scales with the length of the channel , i.e. the distance between the atoms . for the following discussion ,",
    "let us assume that the dominant transmission error is given by photoabsorption .",

    "[ secafc ] by using a few ions in a cavity .",

    "an example : the fiber used in the recent cryptographic experiments by the geneva group ( zbinden _ et al .",

    "_ 1997 ) has a half length @xmath69 of the order of 10 km .",
    "using such a fiber for establishing an epr pair between innsbruck and oxford , say , ( @xmath80km@xmath81 ) requires @xmath82 transmissions if one uses a compound fiber with 100 checkpoints . for a simple fiber , with no checkpoint ,",

    "the total time needed in the first case would be of the order of 1 millisecond ; in the latter case it would be larger than the age of the universe .",
    "so far we have only talked about ` successfully sending a photon across the fiber . '",
    "what we really have in mind , however , is not to directly send arbitrary states of photons , but to establish an epr pair between distant atoms @xmath3 and @xmath4 with the aid of this fiber .",
    "although these two problems are closely related , there is an important difference . to build up the epr correlations , we need only to send very specific states of photons , namely , according to ( [ ekerts ] ) , those which correspond to the atomic state @xmath84 .",
    "this has the advantage that we do not need to trace the evolution of some arbitrary qubit throughout the channel , including the checkpoints , simply because there is no information processing .",
    "the channel may be used for quantum communication _",
    "after _ we have established the epr correlations between @xmath3 and @xmath4 but , at that stage , the state of the channel is irrelevant .",

    ", we ( 1 ) establish @xmath73 ( short - distance ) epr pairs , one pair across every segment ; ( 2 ) connect the epr pairs by making bell measurements at each checkpoint , followed by classical communication between the checkpoints . as a result , a ( long - distance ) epr pair is created between the uttermost atoms .    for a compound fiber consisting of just two segments ,",
    "this scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ flbconnect ] .",
    "the connection process , i.e.  step ( 2 ) , is equivalent to a teleportation of the state of particle @xmath85 , which is entangled with particle @xmath3 , to @xmath4 .",
    "( 300,100 ) ( 0,20 )    to study the connection process in more detail , let us go back and relax our previous assumption that only absorption errors occur , while maintaining the assumption that local 2 bit operations can be performed without error .",
    "for example , suppose the timing of the raman pulses at the beginning and at the end of the transmission is not perfect . in this case , on each segment an epr pair of the form ( [ ekertsen ] )",
    "is created as the result of an @xmath73 step process , with a fidelity @xmath62 that may be high but is not equal to unity . will be determined by the maximum number of purification steps one is willing to apply , or by the limitation inherent in the implementation of the afc , due to imperfections of the local operations in step ( 1 ) that leads to ( [ encoding ] ) . ]    when connecting two epr pairs of the form ( [ ekertsen ] ) , with fidelity @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ flbconnect ] , the resulting pair has a fidelity that is smaller than @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "a brief calculation shows that the fidelity @xmath34 of the new pair satisfies @xmath90 upon connecting @xmath73 pairs of fidelity @xmath91 , we obtain one distant pair of fidelity @xmath92 which can be seen by iterating ( [ connect ] ) @xmath73 times .",
    "note that the connecting need not be done sequentially , i.e. first at checkpoint one , then at two , and so on . a faster ( or rather the fastest ) way to do",
    "this would be in step 1 to simultaneously connect the pairs at every second checkpoint , which leaves one with @xmath93 pairs of fidelity @xmath94 . in step 2",
    "the remaining pairs are again connected at every second checkpoint , which results in @xmath95 pairs with fidelity @xmath96 . if @xmath97 , then the final epr pair with fidelity ( [ f0n ] ) is obtain by iteration after a total of @xmath98 steps .",
    "the lesson to be learned from ( [ f0n ] ) is the following .",
    "the fidelity decreases exponentially with the number of segments unless the initial fidelity @xmath91 on every segment is unity . by dividing the fiber into shorter segments , we have thus eliminated the effect of exponentially increasing transmission losses while , at the same time , introducing an exponential decrease in the fidelity .",
    "the drawback of the second effect , however , does not completely ruin the gain from the first effect .",
    "since the purification protocol described by the sequence ( [ ekertsen ] ) converges towards unit fidelity exponentially fast , one can compensate for the exponential decrease of @xmath34 in ( [ f0n ] ) by starting from a higher initial value @xmath91 .",
    "this requires only a few extra purification steps on each segment , before they are connected .",
    "there is a limit to this , which is given by the maximum fidelity attainable on each segment .",
    "furthermore , the connection process itself will in general be imperfect .",
    "even if we started from @xmath73 epr pairs of unity fidelity , any imperfection in the connection operation would decrease the fidelity of the connected pair , and therefore the fidelity of the connection operation would enter exponentially and reduce the final fidelity .    in summary , any imperfections in local operations ( i.e.  2 bit , 1 bit and measurements ) result in a fidelity that decreases exponentially with the length of the channel .",
    "conversely , the number of operations required to produce an epr pair of a given fidelity increases exponentially with the distance of the particles .",
    "this poses a severe limitation to any distant quantum communication .",
    "we just report here that there is a way around this exponential scaling property by using a purification protocol which re - purifies the obtained epr pairs after a number of connecting steps ( cirac _ et al . _",
    "unpublished ) .",
    "the idea of the procedure is similar to what has been called a ` concatenated quantum code ' by knill & laflamme ( 1996 ) in the context of fault tolerant quantum computing .",
    "however , the problem of creating an epr pair via a noisy channel -consisting of a sequence of imperfect gate operations and transfer operations- is different from fault tolerant quantum computation .",
    "the crucial difference is that we are not , in the first place , sending an arbitrary qubit through the channel . in other words , _ while creating the epr correlations , there is no quantum information being processed _ , although the epr pair may subsequently be used for communication via teleportation .    as a result",
    ", we obtain fidelity requirements on the local operations which are in the few - percent region .",
    "this should be compared with the number of @xmath99 ( knill & laflamme 1996 ) for fault tolerant quantum computing .",
    "we have outlined a procedure for creating maximally entangled pairs of atoms which are connected by a noisy quantum channel .",
    "the essential features of this procedure are ( 1 ) the usage of _ finite means _ i.e. a few ions in two resonators ; ( 2 ) the implementation of an _ absorption - free channel _ that is used for non - local entanglement operations between ions in different resonators ; and ( 3 ) a _ concatenated purification _ algorithm that allows for communication beyond a certain distance that , in usual approaches , is imposed the by exponential transmission losses .",

    "<S> we show how to create maximally entangled epr pairs between spatially distant atoms , each of them inside a high - q optical cavity , by sending photons through a general , noisy channel , such as a standard optical fiber . </S>",
    "<S> an error correction scheme that uses few auxiliary atoms in each cavity effectively eliminates photoabsorption and other transmission errors . </S>",
    "<S> this realizes the ` absorption free channel . ' </S>",
    "<S> a concatenation protocol using the absorption free channel allows for quantum communication with single qubits over distances much larger than the coherence length of the channel .    </S>",
