    "with all three electrons residing in n@xmath122 shells leaving the k shell empty , the three - electron atomic system constitutes an interesting multi - excited atomic problem .",
    "these are ideal for examining the delicate interelectronic correlation of three electrons under the influence of a nucleus , the well - known four - body coulombic problem .",
    "a large majority of these triply excited hollow states are autoionizing and have found important practical applications in the field of high - temperature plasma diagnostics . ever since their first observation in an electron - helium scattering experiment by kuyatt _",
    "[ 1 ] and the same for li in a beam - foil experiment by bruch _ et al . _",
    "[ 2,3 ] , many subsequent attempts were made to study the spectra of these challenging systems over the past three decades .",
    "however the lowest 2s@xmath62p @xmath6p@xmath8 resonance of li in a photoabsorption experiment was reported by kiernan _",
    "[ 4 ] only in 1994 with the aid of a dual - laser plasma technique . in recent years , continuing impressive developments in the synchrotron radiation technology has spawned a great upsurge of interest to measure the position , width and lifetime of these hollow atomic and ionic resonances with greater accuracy and precision .",
    "some of these include for example , but not limited to , the measurement of ( a ) the various even- and odd - parity hollow resonances using photolectron , photoion spectroscopy [ 5 - 9 ] , ( b ) the photoionization cross section [ 10 ] , ( c ) the rydberg series [ 11 ] as well as ( d ) both k and l shell vacancy states , the so - called doubly hollow states [ 6,12 ] , etc",
    ".    from a theoretical perspective , due to the presence of strong and subtle electron correlation effects as well as an infinite number of open channels associated with these resonances , accurate and dependable calculation of their energies and widths have posed formidable difficulties to the theoreticians .",
    "this in addition with the availability of numerous powerful and sophisticated quantum mechanical formalisms have stimulated an extensive amount of theoretical works in the recent years . in one of the earliest attempts , ahmed and lipsky [ 13 ] calculated the lowest triply excited resonances of li - like atoms by a configuration - interaction ( ci ) type formalism . in a later work , safronova and senashenko [ 14 ] performed a detailed and systematic study on the n=2 intrashell states of li isoelectronic series employing a 1/z expansion approach for a wide range of z. thereafter , a multitude of theoretical methodologies have been proposed which provide results in fairly good agreement with the experimental works , _ viz .",
    "_ , the joint saddle point ( sp ) and complex coordinate rotation ( ccr ) method [ 15 - 18 ] , the state - specific theory [ 19,20 ] , the space partition and stabilization approach [ 21 ] , the r - matrix theory along with many of its variants [ 22,23 ] , the truncated diagonalization method ( tdm ) [ 24 - 26 ] , the hyperspherical coordinate formalism [ 27,28 ] , etc .    while a number of formally attractive and elegant methodologies are now available within the traditional wave function based framework , attempts within a density functional viewpoint have been surprisingly very rare .",
    "the latter can be advantageous and desirable in the sense that the former often requires large basis sets and also possibly the mixing of continuum states . also whereas a substantial amount of experimental and theoretical results exist for li , only a few theoretical studies [ 17 - 19,21,25,26,29 - 33 ] and no experimental results exist as yet for the higher members of the isoelectronic series .",
    "moreover , almost all the publications on these ions have dealt exclusively only with the @xmath13 intrashell states ; the only reported results on the @xmath14 resonance series such as those considered in this work , are due to the recent tdm tabulations of conneely _ et al . _",
    "[ 25,26 ] .",
    "furthermore to the best of my knowledge , we are not aware of any density - based results so far for the hollow resonances of these three - electron ions .",
    "the objective of this article is therefore to provide results for such spectra in the lesser explored li - isoelectronic series using a density functional theory ( dft)-based approach with an aim to judge the performance of this formalism in comparison to the commonly used wave function based methodologies in the literature .",
    "earlier an attempt was made to calculate all the 8 n=2 intrashell triply excited states of the li - isoelectronic series ( z=24,6,8,10 ) [ 34 ] with reasonably good accuracy within the realm of nonrelativistic hohenberg - kohn - sham ( hks ) dft . in this scheme ,",
    "a local nonvariational work - function - based exchange potential [ 35 ] and the nonlinear correlation energy functional of lee - yang - parr ( lyp ) [ 36 ] containing the gradient and laplacian of the density was utilized .",
    "the resulting ks type differential equation was numerically solved in the usual self - consistent manner exploiting the numerov s type finite difference ( fd ) scheme . within a single - determinantal approach ,",
    "this has shown to deliver fairly accurate results for various multiply excited states of closed- and open - shell many - electron atoms and ions , e.g. , the low and high as well as the valence and core excitations , bound and autoionizing states , the satellite states , etc . , ( [ 37 - 42 ] , and the references therein ) . however because of the coulomb singularity at r=0 and the long - range @xmath15 behavior , the fd schemes for the radial discretization often requires significantly larger number of grid points to achieve reasonable accuracy even for the ground states and are not feasible for the high - lying rydberg states . to circumvent this problem , subsequently a generalized pseudospectral ( gps ) technique",
    "was suggested for the numerical solution of the ks equation for purposes of greater accuracy and efficiency [ 43 ] .",
    "recently the gps method has been applied quite successfully in the context of electronic structure and dynamics calculation of the coulombic singularities including atoms , molecules as well as other systems like the spiked harmonic oscillators with stronger singularities , the logarithmic potentials , etc [ 43 - 48 ] . using this gps implementation ,",
    "the singly excited state energies for he , and li and be were calculated within 0.01% and 0.02% compared to the best available literature data ; while the doubly excited states of he deviated by a maximum of 3.60% . furthermore the calculated single and double excitation energies were within the ranges of 0.0090.632% and 0.0851.600% respectively .",
    "this provided the motivation to apply this procedure to the more complicated and arguably more interesting triply excited hollow resonance series of the three - electron atoms and ions .",
    "the validity and usefulness of this formalism has been amply demonstrated in a recent study [ 49 ] on the 12 @xmath3n@xmath4 ( n@xmath122 ) hollow resonance series of li covering a total of about 270 low- and high - lying states ( with a maximum of n=25 ) .",
    "the excited state energies were found to remain well within 0.98% ( with one exception ) whereas the excitation energies showed discrepancies in the range of 0.021%0.058% .",
    "additionally 37 @xmath16n@xmath4 ( n@xmath123 ) doubly hollow states were reported , most of them for the first time ever .",
    "here we first compare the dft excitation energies for all the 8 @xmath13 triply excited states , _ viz . , _",

    "comparisons with the available experimental and other theoretical results have been made , wherever possible .",
    "the article is organized as follows : section ii summarizes the basic formalism as well as the computational strategy .",
    "section iii gives a discussion of the computed results while a few concluding remarks are presented in section iv .",
    "the calculation of atomic excited states within the work - function formalism [ 37 - 42,34 ] and its gps implementation [ 43,49 ] has been presented in detail previously and will not be repeated here . in the following",
    "therefore we present only a brief overview of it while addressing the essential problems associated with the excited state dft and some recent developments in this direction .",
    "atomic units are used throughout the article unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "ever since the formal inception in the works of hohenberg - kohn - sham [ 50,51 ] nearly four decades ago , dft has emerged as a powerful practical tool for studying the ground - state properties of many - electron systems such as atoms , molecules , solids etc .",
    "this is chiefly due to its ability to incorporate the electron correlation effects in a clever and computationally inexpensive way .",
    "however inherent difficulties were recognized almost immediately for excited state calculations for the following reasons .",
    "no hohenberg - kohn like theorem exists for a general excited state as the wave function can not be bypassed through the pure - state density in this case .",
    "this is easily realizable from the hydrodynamic formulation [ 52 ] of the wave function ; the phase part of the hydrodynamic function is not constant for a general excited state , although it is constant for the ground and some static stationary excited states . in other words ,",
    "the complex - valued wave function can not be replaced by the real pure - state density function alone and consequently both the charge and current densities have to be taken into consideration .",
    "also an accurate ( not to speak of the exact ) functional form of the exchange - correlation energy in terms of the density ( incorporating the symmetry dependence ) is as yet unknown and may not necessarily have the same dependence on density as for the ground states .",
    "thus although it is advantageous to work in terms of density for the ground states , it is not possible to characterize an individual excited state solely in terms of density ( angular momentum quantum numbers are required to classify them ) .",
    "despite all these problems , a variety of promising and appealing formalisms have been suggested in the past years and this continues to remain a very fertile and demanding area of research .",
    "here we mention a few of the notable ones ; others can be found in the review [ 42 ] . in the subspace formulation of dft [ 53 ] for example , the intuitive idea of slater s transition state theory was put into a rigorous foundation by invoking the concept of ensemble density instead of the pure - state density .",
    "later , a formulation of the ks theory based on the constrained search method was developed [ 54 ] bypassing the hohenberg - kohn theorem and defining the functionals in terms of the slater determinants .",
    "several applications of the ensemble density approach have been made in recent years [ 55,56 ] using a variety of approximate functionals .",
    "further a rayleigh - ritz type variational principle of unequally weighted ensemble has been developed [ 57 ] as a generalization of the ensemble approach , where the lowest m eigenstates are weighted unequally . a time - dependent ( td ) formulation of dft for excited states",
    "[ 58 - 60 ] , based on the td density functional response theory , has shown considerable promise for excited states lately .",
    "the linear response of the fermionic system to a td perturbation leads to the frequency dependent dynamic dipole polarizability whose poles give the excitation energies .",
    "a perturbative treatment has been proposed as well [ 61,62 ] , where the non - interacting ks hamiltonian corresponds to the zeroth - order hamiltonian and the differences in the ks eigenvalues simply give the zeroth - order excitation energies .",
    "recently multiplet energies for transition metal atoms , ions with @xmath18 configurations have been reported [ 63 ] using the scf ks orbitals to construct the atomic multiplet determinantal combinations .    despite all these attempts , a general prescription that can yield the bound and resonance states of a many - electron system reliably and accurately in a simple and uniform way for both low and high excitations , would be highly desirable .",
    "this is partly because , although some of the above methods produce good - quality results for certain states , cause significantly large errors for other states making them unsuitable , presumably due to the fact that the potentials used are the ones obtained for the ground states and also importantly lacking the correct asymptotic behavior .",
    "some others are difficult to implement computationally .",
    "furthermore applications have been mostly restricted to the single excitations and low - lying states ; results for double , triple or other multiple excitations as well as for higher lying states like the rydberg series studied here , have been very scanty [ 43,49 ] . the work - function formulation of excited states as used in this work , either bypasses or partly overcomes the above mentioned problems of dft in dealing with the excited states via an amalgamation of the conventional wave function based quantum mechanics within dft such that the atomic orbital and the electronic configuration features are retained and we summarize its essential features below .",
    "the point of central interest is the following ks type differential equation of the form , @xmath19 \\phi_i({\\mathrm{\\mathbf{r } } } ) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathit{i } } \\phi_{\\mathit{i}}({\\mathrm{\\mathbf{r}}}),\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath20 signifies the usual hartree electrostatic potential including the electron - nuclear attraction and the interelectronic coulomb repulsion , @xmath21 while @xmath22 , the total exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential is partitioned as , @xmath23 now making the assumption that a unique exchange potential exists for a given excited state , one can physically interpret it as the the work done to move an electron against the electric field @xmath24 arising out of the fermi - hole charge distribution , @xmath25 , which can be expressed by the following line integral , @xmath26 where the field @xmath24 has the following form , @xmath27 in order that the potential is well defined , the work done must be path - independent , ( irrotational ) and this is rigorously the case for spherically symmetric systems .",
    "this work against @xmath24 can be determined exactly as the fermi hole is known explicitly in terms of the single - particle orbitals .",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the single - particle density matrix spherically averaged over coordinates of the electrons of a given orbital angular momentum quantum number .",
    "now within the central - field approximation , the orbitals expressed as @xmath30 , give the total electron density as the sum of the occupied orbitals , @xmath31    at this point we note that the usual dft route of obtaining the potential as a functional derivative is avoided by introducing the physical interpretation that the dynamic fermi - coulomb hole charge determines the potential .",
    "the exchange potential does not have an explicit density functional form ( unlike the usual practice in dft ) and it is universal ; the electronic configuration of a particular state defines it so that the same ks equation now equally valid for both ground and excited states .",
    "although this formalism is in the spirit of slater s interpretation of exchange energy based on the notion of fermi hole , this is expected to offer better results compared to the hfs scheme as it incorporates the dynamic nature of the charge distribution .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the fully correlated potential ( both @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) is that of @xmath32 only and falls off as @xmath15 for atomic systems .",
    "however although this path allows an accurate determination of @xmath34 as elaborated , an analogous procedure leading to the accurate form of @xmath35 valid for a general excited state is as yet unknown , because the coulomb hole is not known explicitly in terms of orbitals and therefore requires to be approximated .",
    "several approximate forms have been proposed in the literature ever since dft s inception ; this work uses the well - known lyp [ 36 ] functional which has been found to be quite a good choice for the problem at hand . with this choice of @xmath32 and @xmath33 ,",
    "the ks equation is solved numerically to obtain the self - consistent set of orbitals and the densities therefrom . because @xmath32 is local ,",
    "the solution of the resultant ks equation is computationally much easier than the hf case .",
    "from this set of orbitals , various slater determinants are constructed and different multiplet energies corresponding to a particular electronic configuration are calculated by following slater s diagonal sum rule [ 64 ] .",
    "various other aspects of this formalism can be found in the references [ 37 - 43,34,49 ] .",
    "now a few words about the gps discretization technique is in order .",
    "the commonly used equal - spacing fd schemes often require a significantly large number of spatial grid points because of the coulomb singularity as well as the long - range nature of these physical systems ; even for the accurate calculation of their ground states .",
    "the present legendre pseudospectral discretization approach alleviates this uncomfortable feature in our calculation in three steps : ( a ) the semi - infinite domain @xmath36 $ ] is mapped onto the finite domain @xmath37 $ ] by the transformation @xmath38 , ( b ) then an algebraic nonlinear mapping [ 65,66 ] is used , followed by a ( c ) symmetrization procedure leading to a set of coupled equations .",
    "the overall process gives rise to a symmetric matrix eigenvalue problem which can be accurately and easily solved to yield the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions by using the standard routines .",
    "this allows therefore nonuniform and optimal discretization , maintaining similar accuracies at both small ( denser mesh ) and large ( coarser mesh ) @xmath39 regions with a significantly smaller number of grid points with the promise of a fast convergence .",
    "we used a consistent convergence criteria of @xmath40 and @xmath41 a.u .",
    ", for the potential and eigenvalues respectively ; while a maximum of 500 radial grid points proved to be sufficient to achieve convergence for all the states reported in this work .",
    "at first we present the computed density functional results for the nonrelativistic ground state energies ( in a.u . ) of the li - isoelectronic series , _ viz . , _",
    "be@xmath42 , b@xmath0 , c@xmath43 , n@xmath1 , o@xmath44 , f@xmath2 and ne@xmath45 ions in table i. these are compared with the three best theoretical results in the literature , _ viz . , _ the fully correlated hylleraas type variational method [ 67 ] , the full core plus correlation using multiconfiguration interaction wave functions [ 68 ] , and large expansion of the hylleraas - type functions [ 69,70 ] .",
    "our results show fairly good agreement with all of these .",
    "slight overestimation is observed in the range of 0.0016% for be@xmath42 to 0.0002% for ne@xmath45 .",
    "here we note that within the variationally founded hks dft , all many - body interactions are incorporated into the local multiplicative potential @xmath46/\\delta \\rho$ ] , whose exact form remains unknown as yet .",

    "finally we singled out the 2s@xmath6ns @xmath6s@xmath7 series to demonstrate the feasibility and viability of this formalism for the high - lying rydberg series by calculating the latter for all members with n up to a maximum of 25 .",
    "literature results for these systems have been recently reported for a maximum n of 17 for f@xmath2 ( @xmath47 for other ions ) and thus all the resonances lying above are presented here for the first time . out of about 380 states considered in this work , the excitation energies show a maximum absolute deviation of 0.57% ( for 2s@xmath63p @xmath6p@xmath8 state of be@xmath42 ; excepting this lone case the latter remains below 0.50% ) , which further consolidates the validity of the present density functional formalism in the domain of atomic excited states .",
    "although a substantial amount of results are currently available for the higher resonances in li , the same for the higher members of the isoelectronic sequence are very rare , and we hope that these results will provide helpful references in future theoretical and experimental works .",
    "naturally more accurate theoretical calculations and experimental measurements would be required which could shed more light on our understanding of these triply excited resonances .",
    "the use of local nonvariational work - function based exchange potential and the nonlocal lyp correlation energy functional helps retaining the features of traditional wave function based quantum mechanics within dft , that lies at the success of this approach .",
    "the nonuniform spatial gps discretization of the pertinent ks - type equation in conjunction with the nonlinear mapping and the symmetrization procedure within an essentially single determinantal framework , offers results that are quite comparable in accuracy to other sophisticated and elaborate theoretical methodologies existing in the literature .",
    "given the fact that these are strongly correlated systems , and the work - function exchange potential offers almost hf - quality results for ground and excited states of a variety of physical systems [ 42,72,73 ] including atoms , ions , metals etc .",
    ", a major and obvious source of error in our work is the correlation energy functional , which is designed mainly for the ground states .",
    "while we are forced by the current inadequate status of dft to use this potential , development of a universal prescription for the correlation potential , if possible , in the same spirit as the work - function exchange , would be highly desirable and challenging .",
    "put differently , the correlation functional may be either improved or replaced to describe the intricate correlation effects in a transparent way leading to better accuracy . a secondary and lesser contributing source of inaccuracy may be due to the tacit assumption of spherical symmetry in the work - function exchange .",
    "the extension of this method to other hollow resonances , as well to higher photon - energy hollow series where all the three electrons reside in the shells with @xmath48 are equally straightforward and simple . in conclusion",
    ", this work emphasizes the applicability and feasibility of a simple general and efficient dft - based formalism for the accurate and reliable calculation of the hollow resonances in multiply excited atomic systems .",

    "<S> in this sequel to our work on triply excited hollow resonances in three - electron atomic systems , a density functional theory ( dft)-based formalism is employed to investigate similar resonances in li - isoelectronic series ( z=410 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a combination of the work - function - based local nonvariational exchange potential and the popular gradient plus laplacian included lee - yang - parr correlation energy functional is used . </S>",
    "<S> the generalized pseudospectral method provides nonuniform and optimal spatial discretization of the radial kohn - sham equation to obtain self - consistent set of orbitals and densities in an efficient and accurate manner . </S>",
    "<S> first , all the 8 n=2 intrashell states of b@xmath0 , n@xmath1 and f@xmath2 are presented , which are relatively less studied in the literature compared to the remaining 4 members . </S>",
    "<S> then calculations are performed for the 8 @xmath3n@xmath4 ( 3@xmath5n@xmath56 ) hollow resonance series ; _ viz . , _ </S>",
    "<S> 2s@xmath6ns @xmath6s@xmath7 , 2s@xmath6np @xmath6p@xmath8 , 2s@xmath6nd @xmath6d@xmath7 , 2s2pns @xmath9p@xmath8 , 2s2pnp @xmath9d@xmath7 , 2p@xmath6ns @xmath9p@xmath7 , 2p@xmath6np @xmath9d@xmath8 and 2p@xmath6ns @xmath6d@xmath7 , of all the 7 positive ions . </S>",
    "<S> next , as an illustration , higher resonance positions of the 2s@xmath6ns @xmath6s@xmath7 series are calculated for all the ions with a maximum of n=25 . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation energies calculated from this single - determinantal approach are in excellent agreement with the available literature data ( for the n=2 intrashell states the deviation is within 0.125% and excepting only one case , the same for the resonance series is well below 0.50% ) . with an increase in z , </S>",
    "<S> the deviations tend to decrease . </S>",
    "<S> radial densities are also presented for some of the selected states . the only result available in the literature for the lower resonances ( corresponding to a maximum of n=17 ) </S>",
    "<S> have been reported very recently . </S>",
    "<S> the n@xmath1016 ( @xmath11 for f@xmath2 ) resonances are examined here for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a promising viable and general dft scheme for the accurate calculation of these and other hollow resonances in many - electron atoms . </S>"
