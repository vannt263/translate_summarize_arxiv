    "we present the inclusion of the latter @xcite . for decay modes , we focus on the leptonic decay with electron and muon in the final state .",
    "if sneutrinos decay invisibly into the lsp and a neutrino , this channel provides tools to determine sneutrino masses .",
    "such decays , common in many scenarios within the mssm , preclude threshold scans since sneutrinos can not be reconstructed directly . the only possibility to access the sneutrino mass in such",
    "a case is to select a cascade decay where the precise determination of kinematic distributions gives access to the sneutrino mass .",
    "although this idea has already been exploited  @xcite , a thorough study of how precise the mass determination for the sneutrino in the environment of an ilc can be has as yet not been made .",
    "we study the pollution effects of all reducible and irreducible sm and susy backgrounds on the visibility of the signal as well as the precision of the sneutrino and the chargino mass measurements .",

    "the collinear and infrared singularities are regulated by @xmath6 and the photon mass @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the dependence on @xmath7 is eliminated by adding the soft real photon contribution @xmath8 with a universal soft factor @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we break the ` hard ' contribution @xmath10 , i.e.  the real - radiation process @xmath11 , into a collinear and a non - collinear part , separated at a photon acollinearity angle @xmath12 relative to the incoming electron or positron .",

    "this approach runs into the problem of negative event weights  @xcite : for some values of @xmath18 , the @xmath19 part of the nlo - corrected squared matrix element is positive definite by itself only if @xmath20 is sufficiently large . to obtain unweighted event samples ,",
    "an ad - hoc approach is to simply drop events with negative weights before proceeding further .",
    "negative event weights can be avoided by resumming higher - order initial radiation using an exponentiated structure function @xmath21  @xcite . in order to avoid double - counting in the combination of the isr - resummed lo result with the additional nlo contributions @xcite , we have subtracted from the effective squared matrix element the soft and virtual photonic contributions that have already been accounted for in @xmath22 .",

    "convoluting this with the resummed isr structure function for each incoming beam , we obtain a modified @xmath19 part of the total cross section which contains all nlo contributions and in addition includes higher order soft and collinear photonic corrections to the born / one - loop interference .",
    "this differs from the standard treatment in the literature ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) where higher order photon contributions are combined with the born term only ( `` born+ '' ) .",
    "the complete result also contains the hard non - collinear @xmath24 part convoluted with the isr structure function : @xmath25 the resummation approach eliminates the problem of negative weights such that unweighting of generated events and realistic simulation at nlo are now possible in all regions of phase - space .",
