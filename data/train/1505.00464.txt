    "the scattering of waves by disorder is more the rule than the exception in condensed materials .",
    "scattering is the source of electrical resistance and makes materials opaque to classical waves . whereas , all ordered samples of a given material are alike",
    ", every disordered sample is disordered in its own way .",
    "this can be seen directly in the distinct grainy pattern of intensity of scattered laser light for each sample @xcite .",
    "the speckle pattern within or beyond an illuminated sample arises from the interference of waves following all possible paths to any point .",
    "though the wave field appears to be completely random in disordered samples , it is still possible to manipulate the incident wavefront to control the net transmission and to focus the transmitted wave .",
    "this was first achieved by focusing light to a point utilizing feedback from the transmitted wave to manipulate the input wave @xcite . in principle , a considerable measure of control over the output wave can be exerted by tailoring the incident wave if the field transmission coefficients between all incident and outgoing channels are known @xcite .",
    "these coefficients are the elements of the transmission matrix ( tm ) . in this review ,",
    "we consider the use of the tm to describe the propagation and control of classical waves in random media .",
    "this will be placed in the electronic context in which the tm in the quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) wire geometry was first utilized by fisher and lee @xcite to describe electronic conductance and by dorokhov to describe the scaling of the eigenvalues of the transmission matrix and the conductance @xcite .",
    "because of the strong analogy between electronic and classical wave transport , it is possible to demonstrate fundamental predictions for electron transport in equivalent settings for classical waves in cases in which the predictions have not been demonstrated for electrons .",
    "in addition , consideration of the tm for classical waves has stimulated the investigation of universal aspects of transmission eigenvalues such as the dynamics and spatial profiles of the energy density of transmission eigenchannels , which can not be explored directly in conductance measurements .",
    "the tm is a powerful tool for studying transport in disordered media in which the random field pattern excited by a monochromatic wave is coherent in time throughout the sample @xcite . for classical waves , thermal fluctuations in position of the sample s constituents in static samples",
    "are much smaller than the wavelength so that the wave may be temporally coherent even on a macroscopic scale . in contrast",
    ", the electron wave is only phase - coherent in micron - sized conductors at ultralow temperature .",
    "such samples lie between the microscopic atomic scale and macroscopic lengths .",
    "the suppression of diffusion @xcite and the enhancement of fluctuations in conductance @xcite due to interference in samples of intermediate or mesoscopic dimensions have been the focus of studies of electronic transport .",
    "anderson @xcite showed that electrons in an unbounded lattice would be exponentially localized when the range of random values of the electron energy at a site is sufficiently large even when they are not trapped energetically .",
    "this leads to the absence of electron diffusion . unlike the speckle pattern that is washed out by averaging over disorder ,",
    "anderson localization is an interference effect that survives averaging over random configurations .",
    "the suppression of average transport is a consequence of the constructive interference of partial waves that follow the same path returning to a coherence volume in the sample but in time - reversed order @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . the transverse dimensions of the coherence volume is the field correlation length @xmath0 . because the amplitudes and phases associated with such time - reversed partial waves are identical , the amplitude for return for paths following the loop for both senses is twice that for a single partial wave following the loop in either direction .",
    "the probability of return of a particle is therefore four times that for a single path and thus twice the probability given by the incoherent sum of probabilities for the two partial waves of each loop .",
    "this is the basis of weak localization @xcite which reduces average transport .",
    "when the probability of return to a coherence volume reaches unity , the wave becomes localized .",
    "the effect of weak localization is observed directly as coherent backscattering in the domain of the reflected wavevector @xcite .",
    "reflection is enhanced by a factor of two over the background level in the retroreflection direction .",
    "the angular distribution of backscattered light is the fourier transform of the intensity distribution of the point spread function for light incident on the incident surface .",
    "the enhancement falls in an angular range of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the wavenumber and @xmath3 the transport mean free path .",
    "measurements of coherent backscattering therefore allow for the determination of the mean free path .",
    "in three dimensions and its time - reversed partner.,width=192 ]    ioffe and regel @xcite suggested that , an electron can not be considered to be freely propagating if the scattering mean free path were only a fraction of the wavelength .",
    "this yields the localization criterion in three dimensions , @xmath4 .",
    "this condition is also given by a calculation of the return probability based on diffusion theory in three dimensions .",
    "subsequently , thouless @xcite argued that localization in any dimension should depend only upon the dimensionless ratio of the average width and spacing of energy levels , which has come to be known as the thouless number , @xmath5 .",
    "electronic levels correspond to quasi - normal modes or resonances for classical waves in open systems .",
    "the width of levels , which in units of angular frequency is equal to the leakage rate of energy from the sample , is closely linked to the sensitivity of level energies to changes at the boundary since both are proportional to the ratio of the strengths of the mode at the boundary relative to the interior of the sample .",
    "when the wave is localized within the interior of a sample , the amplitude of the wave is exponentially small at the boundary and the mode is weakly coupled to the surrounding medium .",
    "its lifetime is then long and its linewidth correspondingly narrow , so that , @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the wave is diffusive , modes extend throughout the medium ; the wave then couples readily to its surroundings and the width of a typical level overlaps several modes , @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the localization threshold occurs at @xmath8 .",
    "thouless @xcite showed that for diffusive samples , @xmath9 is equal to the conductance in units of the quantum of conductance @xmath10 .",
    "since the level width falls inversely with the square of sample length for diffusive samples while the spacing between levels falls only inversely with the sample length in the quasi-1d wire geometry of constant cross section , @xmath9 falls inversely with sample length .",
    "thus there will always be a crossover from diffusive to localized wave transport as the length of a wire increases .",
    "the crossover will occur at a sample length @xmath11 , at which @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath13 is the localization length of the sample and @xmath14 is the number of channels .",
    "the channels can be the propagating transverse modes in the ideal leads attached to a conductor at a given voltage .",
    "the total number of channels is approximately @xmath15 including two electronic spin states , where @xmath16 is the constant cross sectional area of the sample and @xmath17 is the electron wavelength .",
    "_ @xcite argued that the variation of average _ g _ with the dimensions of the sample should depend only upon the value of _ g _ and the dimensionality .",
    "a localization transition is predicted to exist only in 3d in which _",
    "g _ falls essentially exponentially with increasing sample size for @xmath18 and increases for @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "since the conductance exhibits large fluctuations for localized waves , the mean value of the conductance is insufficient to characterize the nature of electronic transport and the full distribution of the conductance needs to be given .",
    "_ @xcite hypothesized that the logarithm of the conductance of localized waves in one - dimensional ( 1d ) samples follows a gaussian distribution with a variance approaching the average of the logarithm of the conductance , @xmath20 .",
    "the scaling of the distribution of conductance for localized waves in 1d would then be completely specified by the single parameter @xmath21 .",
    "electronic conductance in disordered 1d conductors and transmission of classical waves in mesoscopic media are seen to have equivalent descriptions in the 1d landauer relation , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the transmission @xcite .",
    "the landauer relation was extended to multichannel mesoscopic systems via the tm @xcite .",
    "the elements @xmath24 of the transmission matrix @xmath25 are the field transmission coefficients between incoming channels it a and output channels _ b_. the dimensionless conductance in quasi-1d samples is equal to the sum of @xmath26 pairs of intensity transmission coefficient , which is the transmittance , @xmath23 , @xmath27",
    ". the dimensionless conductance or transmittance can also be expressed as the sum of the transmission eigenvalues , @xmath28 . here , the @xmath29 are the eigenvalues of the matrix product @xmath30 .",
    "the transmission eigenvalues can also be obtained via the singular value decomposition of the tm , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are unitary matrices with columns which are the singular vectors yielding the output and input of the transmission eigenchannels and @xmath34 is the diagonal matrix with elements @xmath35 .",
    "dorokhov @xcite considered the scaling of _ g _ in samples made up of @xmath36 parallel 1d disordered chains with transverse coupling to create a quasi-1d sample .",
    "he found that , instead of a single localization length @xmath13 , there exists @xmath36 auxiliary localization lengths , @xmath37 , which describe the scaling of the averages of each of the transmission eigenvalues vs. length via the relation , @xmath38 the inverse auxiliary localization lengths are are given by @xmath39 for integers @xmath40 so that these are equally spaced with spacing @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "an intuitive coulomb gas model @xcite was developed to describe the statistics of transmission eigenvalues .",
    "this is based on the model originally introduced by dyson @xcite to visualize the logarithmic repulsion between eigenvalue of a large random hamiltonian matrix @xcite . in the coulomb gas model , the @xmath29",
    "are associated with the positions of parallel lines of charges at @xmath42 for @xmath40 and image charges of the same sign at @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the line charges in the model are embedded in a compensating continuous charge background of opposite sign .",
    "the background charge tends to screen the line charges from the interaction with other line charges . for diffusive waves ,",
    "the spacing between neighboring charges is small compared to the screening length . as a result , there exists a logarithmic repulsion between the transmission eigenvalues due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "the roughly uniform distribution of @xmath44 imposed by the mutual repulsion of charges leads to the bimodal distribution of transmission eigenvalues @xmath45 with peaks in the probability distribution for @xmath45 near unity and at exponentially small values of @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the repulsion between charges for diffusive waves leads to universal conductance fluctuations . in quasi-1d disordered systems with time - reversal symmetry , @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "universal conductance fluctuations were first measured in mesoscopic conductors at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of conductance of a gold wire at 10 mk as a function of magnetic field applied perpendicular to the wire are shown in fig .",
    "dorokhov @xcite showed that transport through disordered conductors is dominated by _",
    "g _ eigenvalues with @xmath48 and so transmission through these channels is of order unity .",
    "the number of such open eigenchannels with @xmath49 , which is essentially the conductance for diffusive quasi-1d samples , is inversely proportional to the sample length in accord with ohm s law . for localized waves , however , the spacing between charges in the coulomb gas model is greater than the screening length so that the coulomb interaction between charges is diminished .",
    "the smallest of the @xmath44 , @xmath50 , is larger than unity for localized waves so the transmission eigenvalues fall exponentially with @xmath51 , @xmath52 . as a result ,",
    "the conductance is dominated by the highest transmission eigenchannel @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to electronic systems , for which only the conductance can be measured , it is in principle possible to measure the elements of the tm for classical waves .",
    "thus the transmission coefficients for the field , @xmath24 , intensity @xmath54 , total transmission @xmath55 and transmittance @xmath23 can be measured .",

    "in contrast , for localized waves @xmath60 , distinct peaks appear when the incident radiation is on resonance with a quasi - normal mode .",
    "the resonance condition holds for all source and detector positions and therefore sharp peaks remain even when transmission is integrated over space.,width=384 ]    the first question that was addressed in bounded samples was the scaling of conductance .",

    "the profile of the complete transmission eigenchannel with @xmath255 is found to be closely related to the probability of a wave returning to a cross - section at a depth _ x _ in an open disordered medium @xcite .",
    "we have found that the profile of an eigenchannel with @xmath256 can be expressed as a product of the profile of the fully transmitting eigenchannel and a function governed only by the auxiliary localization length @xmath257 , which was previously used to parameterize the corresponding transmission eigenvalues via @xmath258 .",
    "these results not only give a physical meaning to the set of @xmath257 but also enable control of the energy deposition inside the opaque media .     for eigenvalues @xmath259 , 0.5 , 0.1 , and 0.001 for a diffusive sample with @xmath260 .",
    "@xmath261 is the energy integrated over the transverse dimension and is normalized to equal @xmath45 at the output surface .",
    "( b ) ensemble averages of energy density profiles for all transmission eigenchannels with the eigenchannel indices _",
    "n _ from 1 to _",
    "n_. the linear falloff of the average of the energy density over all eigenchannels is in accord with the diffusion theory .",
    "( from ref .",
    "in this review , we have discussed the power of the transmission matrix to describe the statistics of transmission and control of waves propagating through disordered systems .",
    "we have shown that the joint probability distribution @xmath262 determines the statistics of transmission over a random ensemble up to second order , while the statistics within a single sample of given @xmath23 depends only on @xmath96 .",
    "the statistics of transmission in multi - channel disordered systems approach predictions for 1d , when the transmission is dominated by a single transmission eigenchannel and so @xmath85 . in this limit , the sps hypothesis for scaling in random 1d system holds for multi - channel disordered samples .",
    "the contrast of optimal focusing through and within a scattering sample is equal to @xmath96 of the measured tm , provided that the number of the measured channels of the tm is much greater than _ g_. the spatial profile of the focused wave is given in terms of the degree of long - range intensity correlation and the spatial field correlation function while the temporal profile of a focused pulse is equal to the square of the field - field correlation function in time .",
    "in addition to the transmission eigenvalues , which describe static transmission , there exists a complementary set of parameters , which gives the dwell time and the integrated intensity inside the sample for transmission eigenchannels , and the contribution of each eigenchannel to the dos .",
    "the tm approach allows us to determine the dos of a disordered material without finding each of the qnms in the system , which can be difficult for diffusive samples because of the modal overlap .",
    "the ability to deposit energy deep within the sample via high - transmission eigenchannels may find applications in deep tissue imaging , depth profiling , photodynamic therapy and random lasing .",
    "we thank chushun tian , xiaojun cheng , and jerome klosner for stimulating discussions and howard rose for construction of the microwave sample holder .",
    "the research was supported by the national science foundation ( dmr-1207446 ) ."
