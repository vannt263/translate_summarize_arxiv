    "inspired by the application as a standard cosmological candle , the progress in understanding type ia supernovae ( sneia ) has grown in leaps and bounds . however , the understanding of their weakest subluminous cousins has been purposefully overlooked as their atypical light curve and atypical spectra make them contaminants for cosmological studies .",
    "we suggest here some characteristics that make the physics of the explosions of faint sneia intriguing in their own right .    in this paper , we present sn2007ax which , with a peak absolute magnitude of m@xmath0 = @xmath115.9 and ( @xmath2)@xmath3 = 1.2 , is the faintest and reddest type ia supernova yet discovered .",
    "although the class of sneia is remarkably homogenous , subluminous sneia show atypical spectral and light curve features ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "photometrically , not only do they fade much faster than predicted by the phillips relation , they are also very red at maximum and ( at least sn2005ke and sn2007ax ) appear to show uv excess at late - time .",
    "spectroscopically , they have broad features and moderate expansion velocities .",
    "sn2007ax was discovered in ngc2577 on ut 2007 mar 21.978 by @xcite at an unfiltered magnitude of 17.2 .",
    "upper limits of @xmath718.5 mag on mar 17.636 and @xmath719.0 mag on mar 9.959 were also reported .",
    "spectra obtained on mar 26 by @xcite and @xcite showed that it was a snia near maximum light similar to sn1991bg .    in this paper ,",
    "we present multi - epoch , multi - band imaging and spectroscopic follow up of sn2007ax including optical , ultraviolet , and near - infrared .",
    "we summarize our observations in  2 , present our analysis and comparison with other faint sneia in  3 and discuss possible scenarios for faint thermonuclear explosions in  4 .",
    "we conclude with how future surveys can systematically design their cadence , limiting magnitude and pointings to search for more members belonging to this subclass of faint sneia .",
    "the automated palomar 60-inch telescope @xcite started daily observations of sn2007ax on ut 2007 mar 29 in @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands .",
    "data were reduced using custom routines .",
    "aperture photometry was done after image subtraction using two custom modifications of the isis algorithm @xcite , _ hotpants _ and _ mkdifflc _ ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the two reductions gave consistent results .",
    "errors were estimated by first placing artificial sources of the same brightness and at the same distance from the galaxy center as the sn and then measuring the scatter in measured magnitudes .",
    "finally , the zeropoint was calibrated with reference magnitudes of stars from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "we triggered target of opportunity observations to obtain spectra with the double beam spectrograph @xcite on the hale 200-inch telecope .",
    "two spectra were obtained around maximum light ( ut 2007 mar 29 and mar 30 ) and a third a fortnight later ( apr 13 ) .",
    "spectra were taken using the red grating 158/7500 , blue grating 300/3990 and using a dichroic to split the light at 5500  .",
    "this gave us a total wavelength coverage of 3800  - 9000  and dispersion of 4.9  pix@xmath10 and 2.1  pix@xmath10 on the red and blue side , respectively .",
    "data were reduced using the standard iraf package _",
    "we triggered swift target of opportunity observations for sn2007ax starting ut 2007 mar 29.84 and obtained eight epochs of roughly five kiloseconds each distributed between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands .",
    "we also obtained a reference image over eight months after peak to subtract galaxy light .",
    "aperture photometry was performed using a 3@xmath13 circular radius . to estimate the galaxy brightness at this location ,",
    "a 3@xmath13 aperture at the supernova position in the reference image was used .",
    "@xcite photometric zeropoints were applied after appropriately scaling for aperture size . for consistency with calibration ,",
    "a 5@xmath13 aperture was used in the computation of coincidence loss .",
    "the supernova is detected in @xmath14 in four epochs , and not detected in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 filters .",
    "the @xmath17 band light curve was independently reduced using image subtraction with consistent results .",
    "we note that due to the faintness of the supernova and brightness of galaxy background , coincidence loss is dominated by the galaxy light and not a point source , possibly introducing a systematic error in the swift @xmath18 , @xmath17 , and @xmath12 bands .",
    "further late - time @xmath19 observations were obtained using the slotis and bok telescopes and light curves were obtained using image subtraction based on isis and iraf routines .",
    "we also obtained near infrared @xmath20 imaging using the keck nirc2 instrument with natural guide star adaptive optics on ut 2007 apr 4 .",
    "we present analysis of the optical and ultra - violet light curve and optical spectrum of sn2007ax below",
    ". we also compare it to other subluminous sn ia .",
    "we adopt a distance modulus of 32.2 ( b. tully , pers .",
    "comm . ) to ngc2577 .",
    "20days while typical sneia ( sn2005am , dotted line ) continue to decline .",
    "[ fig : lc],width=336 ]    we plot the multi - band light curve of sn2007ax in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "the key characteristic of sn2007ax is its rapid decline .",
    "traditionally , @xmath4m@xmath5 ( the difference between the peak b - mag and the b - mag 15 days after the peak ) has been used to parametrize the decline of the light curve . however",
    ", this parameter can be misleading when applied to the faint sneia because the knee in their light curve ( transition from fast initial decline to slow late - time decline ) is sooner than fifteen days from the peak .",
    "therefore , we choose to compare the light curves of subluminous ia using three parameters first introduced by @xcite - initial slope ( @xmath21 ) , late - time slope ( @xmath22 ) and the time of intersection of the two slopes ( t@xmath23 ) .",
    "this time of intersection parameter ( defined from maximum in b - mag ) was also used by @xcite as t@xmath24 and shown to be empirically proportional to @xmath4m@xmath5 for some sneia .     of the early - time and late - time slopes",

    "we fit an empirical relation to the intersection time as a function of peak absolute magnitude and find that @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , this transition to slower decline should represent the time at which the optical depth to thermalized radiation becomes thin .",
    "we report these three parameters for a sample of subluminous sneia in table  [ tab : comparelc ] and and show the linear fits in figure  [ fig : lczoom ] .",
    "another crucial property of subluminous sneia is that the fainter they are , the redder they are at maximum .",
    "we find that sn2007ax is consistent within uncertainties of the empirical relation derived first by @xcite : @xmath29 .",
    "this relation predicts a color in the range of 1.01.3 mag and we observe 1.2 @xmath27 0.1 mag .",
    "this color has been derived based on synthetic photometry of the spectra around maximum .      in figure",
    "[ fig : lc ] , we compare the swift uvot light curve of sn2007ax to another subluminous snia 2005ke @xcite and a typical snia 2005am @xcite .",
    "the key similarity between sn2005ke and sn2007ax is that both show an excess in uv starting @xmath3020 days after the peak . @xcite",
    "propose that sn2005ke showed a uv excess due to circumstellar interaction .",
    "perhaps , subluminous supernovae are optically thin below 3800   simply due to lower production of iron - group elements .",
    "the question of whether uv excess is a more general property of faint sneia merits further investigation with timely follow - up of a larger sample . with a larger sample , one could also consider whether the break in the uv light curve also depends on absolute magnitude .",
    "we compare optical spectra of sn2007ax to sn1991bg in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the prominent absorption features are , , and .",
    "the presence of intermediate mass elements like oxygen and titanium is indicative of the presence of unburned material or a low burning efficiency .",
    "the absorption features become broader as the supernova evolves . comparing our spectra to sn1991bg one day , two days and sixteen days after maximum in b - band , we find that the spectra are very similar . in the first epoch , we see a hint of carbon in the small bump immediately redward of the feature at 6150   .",
    "however , the signal - to - noise ratio in the spectrum is too low for any conclusive evidence .    using the technique described by @xcite",
    ", we estimate the temperature diagnostic r ( )  the ratio of the depths of the two features at 5800   and 6150    to be 0.33 . this is smaller than what is implied by the empirical relations derived by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also measure the velocity of the 6150  line in the two epochs around maximum and we obtain 9300 km  s@xmath10 and 8800 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "this is consistent with lower velocities observed in other faint sneia @xcite .",
    "we measure a k@xmath31 magnitude of 16.7 @xmath27 0.1 on ut 2007 apr 4 .",
    "we determined the contribution of galaxy light at the supernova position by fitting a sersic profile to the galaxy using galfit @xcite .",
    "the best - fit parameters are : a sersic index of 1.90 , axis ratio of 0.60 , effective radius of 4.98@xmath13 , position angle of 105.6@xmath32 and diskiness of @xmath10.14 .",
    "we find no evidence of dust lanes in this image suggesting that the host extinction is minimal .",
    "this is also consistent with the absence of the interstellar na d line at 5893  .",
    "we compute an upper limit on the equivalent width as 0.1  .  using the relations derived in @xcite , we get an upper limit of e(@xmath2 ) @xmath33 0.01 mag on the extinction .    based on the galactic position , l=201.1@xmath32 , b=29.6@xmath32 , the extinction along the line of sight is e(@xmath2)=0.054 mag @xcite .",
    "therefore , we account for a@xmath0 = 0.23 and a@xmath34= 0.18 in our calculations of absolute magnitude and luminosities .",
    "@xcite gives an estimate of the @xmath35ni mass in the ejecta using the peak bolometric luminosity and the rise time : @xmath36^{-1}\\ ] ] for sn2007ax , the extinction - corrected peak bolometric luminosity is 2.3@xmath3710@xmath38 ergs  s@xmath10 .",
    "we estimate this by using the photometric points to calibrate our spectrum near maximum light and integrating .",
    "the rise - time is unknown and unfortunately , the literature somewhat arbitrarily assume 17 days for faint sneia and 19.5 days for typical sneia .",
    "recently , @xcite used sn1999by early - time data to estimate a rise - time of 14 days .",
    "the only observational constraint we have for sn2007ax is that the rise - time is longer than 6 days .",
    "thus , for the range of rise - times from 614 days , we find a @xmath35ni mass of 0.050.09 m@xmath39 .",
    "this is consistent with other techniques to estimate @xmath35ni of faint sneia  for sn1991bg , @xcite model the v - band light curve and obtain a mass of 0.1 m@xmath39 , and @xcite model the photospheric and nebular - epoch spectra and obtain @xmath35ni mass of 0.07 m@xmath39 .",
    "to summarize , the primary observational characteristics of subluminous sneia ( of which sn2007ax is an extreme case ) are small t@xmath40 in the optical @xmath6-band light curve , extremely red @xmath2 color at maximum , possible excess in uv emission at late - time , presence of intermediate mass elements in spectra , medium ejecta velocities , low @xmath35ni mass in ejecta and short rise - times .",
    "several theoretical models have been proposed to explain faint sneia ",
    "complete detonation of a sub - chandrashekhar mass white dwarf , a delayed detonation model , a failed neutron star model and a small scale deflagration model .",
    "the detonation of a sub - chandrashekhar c - o white dwarf ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) produces more @xmath35ni than observed and is more blue at maximum than observed @xcite .",
    "if we consider detonation of a sub - chandrashekhar o - ne - mg white dwarf @xcite , the total nuclear energy is smaller and the predicted ejecta velocities are lower than observed @xcite .",
    "@xcite use detailed spectral modeling to show a common explosion mechanism for all sneia , likely delayed detonation .",
    "the failed neutron star model @xcite suggests that if the accretion rate of carbon and oxygen from a companion onto a white dwarf is high enough , it may prematurely ignite co on the white dwarf surface .",
    "thus , instead of a neutron star , we may see a faint sneia .",
    "small - scale deflagration models suggest that either the burning is restricted to the outer layers or that it occurs slowly .",
    "another intriguing theoretical possibility recently proposed by @xcite is faint thermonuclear supernovae from ultracompact double degenerate am cvn systems .",
    "this supernova is tantalizingly at the brightest end of their predictions ( m@xmath41=@xmath114 to @xmath116 , timescale = 26 days , m@xmath42 0.1 m@xmath43 ) .",
    "however , the decay time predicted by these models is much shorter and the @xmath35ni mass less than that observed in sn2007ax .",
    "also , the spectrum does not show any feature which suggests being powered by different radioactive material ( @xmath44cr , @xmath45ti , @xmath46fe ) produced by some of these models .",
    "none of the above models convincingly explain all the observed characteristics of subluminous sneia .",
    "sn2007ax compels the question of what is the ( and whether there is ) lower limit of @xmath35ni mass in a thermonuclear explosion . only if we can explain the extremely faint ( and the extremely bright ) supernovae will we thoroughly understand the limitations in physical processes involved in the thermonuclear explosion , in particular , the @xmath35ni mass production .",
    "future supernova surveys which have a shorter cadence and a deeper limiting magnitude will provide invaluable clues to understanding the nature of subluminous sneia .",
    "follow - up of these supernovae with well - sampled uv light curves and well - calibrated multi - epoch uv spectra would also be important to understand the apparent excess at late - time .",
    "we suggest how a near - future survey , for example , the palomar transient factory , can systematically search for faint sneia .",
    "the parameters of the survey design are sky coverage , cadence , depth , filter and choice of pointings .",
    "@xcite shows that faint sneia occur preferentially in early - type galaxies and @xcite suggest that they occur in lower metallicity , old stellar mass populations .",
    "since they decline by a magnitude in five days , the cadence of the search should be faster than five days so that the detection sample is complete . since faint sneia",
    "are extremely red at maximum , we should choose a red filter for the search . to maximize sky coverage , searching with a single red filter should suffice ( with multi - band follow - up ) .",
    "since the local universe is clumpy ( e.g. : @xmath3025% of the total light at the distance of virgo is in the virgo supercluster ) , the sky coverage must include concentrations in stellar mass , such as the virgo , perseus and coma galaxy clusters .",
    "the rate of normal sneia is 3 per 10@xmath47l@xmath39 per century @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate a rate for subluminous sneia to be 16% of normal sneia rate based on loss and baoss surveys . to a depth of absolute magnitude of @xmath115.5 , and with a limiting magnitude of 20.5 , the survey volume would be 1.5@xmath37 10@xmath48 mpc@xmath49 . using the 2mass k - band luminosity function of 5.1@xmath5010@xmath51l@xmath39mpc@xmath52 ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) , we expect a rate of the faintest subluminous supernovae to be @xmath30370 all sky per year .",
    "the palomar transient factory plans a 5-day cadence 2700 sq .",
    "experiment which would give @xmath3024 faint sneia per year .",
    "we thank nick scoville , milan bogoslavejic and the swift team for performing our target of opportunity observations flawlessly .",
    "we would like to thank brent tully for providing his catalog of nearby galaxies .",
