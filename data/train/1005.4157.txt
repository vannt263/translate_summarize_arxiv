    "we have also restricted ourselves by the study of limiting case when the intercarrier coulomb scattering is dominating . as shown in @xcite for the intrinsic graphene case ,",
    "this is an adequate approach .",
    "possible contribution of other generation - recombination mechanisms ( note , that the auger - processes are forbidden due to the symmetry of electron - hole states @xcite ) require an additional investigation .",
    "further , we have assumed that the heat removal is sufficiently effective ( this point becomes insignificant in the case of short electric pulses when the thermostat is not overheated ) . at last , to describe the momentum relaxation we take into account only the statical disorder scattering using the phenomenological model of ref .",
    "10 ( which is in good agreement with the experimental data ; the microscopic mechanisms of scattering are still unclear @xcite ) .",
    "the listed assumptions should not essentially modify the peculiarities of the heating mechanisms , in comparison with a study that will treat relaxation processes in more details ; in addition , here many limitations are imposed also because of the lack of data on graphene .    to conclude ,",
    "essential heating of carriers is shown in present study .",
    "it will define different parameters of possible graphene - based devices .",
    "in addition , investigation of hot carriers ( even within the considered limited region of parameters ) gives important information about mechanisms of relaxation and recombination in graphene .",
