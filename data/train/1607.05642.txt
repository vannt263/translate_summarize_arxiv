    "the qcd phase diagram is subject of active research both theoretically and experimentally . on the theoretical side",
    "the phase structure of qcd has implications for the understanding of the early and modern universe , where the quark - gluon plasma and compact astrophysical objects still pose unanswered questions . for experimentalists , it of course serves as guide for current and future experiments and facilities .",
    "studies of the phase diagram at non - zero chemical potential @xmath0 are extremely difficult due to a complex statistical weight , which results in what is known as the _ sign problem_. in qcd this behaviour is caused by the quark determinant , after the quark fields have been integrated out @xmath1^\\ast = \\det m(u,-\\mu^\\ast)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 generically represents the gauge links .",

    "the latter is a non - compact manifold and therefore large excursions into the imaginary directions may occur during the simulation . as a way to keep track of such excursions and prevent them from becoming large  by using gauge transformations between langevin updates  we measure the distance from su(@xmath4 ) , @xmath15 ^ 2 \\geq 0 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the lattice extents in the spatial and temporal directions , respectively .",

    "a study of this method applied to one- and two - dimensional qcd can be found in @xcite .",
