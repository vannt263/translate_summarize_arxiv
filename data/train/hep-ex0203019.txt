    "it is useful to consider the possible impact on physics of upgrades to the lhc which would permit operation at a higher luminosity . for comparison purposes , the effect of an energy increase",
    "will also be considered .",
    "four basic scenarios for high energy / luminosity @xmath14 colliders are used in this note .",
    "the higher luminosity operation would correspond to a bunch spacing of 12.5 ns .    *",
    "a the approved lhc , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath15 tev and luminosity of @xmath16 @xmath17 sec@xmath18 * b @xmath15 tev and luminosity of @xmath19 @xmath17 sec@xmath18 * c @xmath20 tev and luminosity of @xmath16 @xmath17 sec@xmath18 * d @xmath20 tev and luminosity of @xmath19 @xmath17 sec@xmath18    note that , while scenario b represents a realistic upgrade scenario for the lhc , scenarios c and d are much more speculative .",
    "the impact of the upgrades on detector performance has not been assessed in detail but a few general remarks are appropriate . the baseline performance is documented in @xcite .",
    "the higher luminosity has a severe impact . in the case of the atlas inner detector , the transition radiation detector would need to be replaced due to the high occupancy .",
    "radiation damage would imply replacement or removal of the pixels and some of the silicon layers .",
    "removal would imply loss of tracking , electron identification and b - tagging capability .",
    "calorimeter performance is not expected to be impacted significantly in the central region ; some of the tile calorimeters scintillating fibers may need to be replaced . the forward calorimeter ( fcal )",
    "could suffer from space - charge effects .",
    "more shielding will be required for the forward muon system which will reduce the fiducial region .",
    "the reduced bunch spacing at very high luminosity could have a severe impact on the front - end electronics , trigger and daq components .",
    "for example , the front end pipeline buffers would be incompatible with the latency needed for the level-1 trigger .",
    "the level-1 muon trigger could also be compromised by increased occupancy in the resistive plate and thin gap chambers .",
    "the atlas b - physics programme @xcite does not benefit significantly from the energy or luminosity upgrades .",
    "the programme is accomplished primarily at low luminosity and , as the total b cross section increases only slightly at the higher energy , the energy upgrade will have little impact . similarly the top production rate is very large in the baseline lhc and , possibly apart from rare decay modes , the physics will be fully exploited at design energy / luminosity .",
    "physics processes involving the production of high - mass systems have cross - sections that rise rapidly with energy .",
    "while the luminosity upgrade has the capability to significantly enhance the lhc capability , one should expect therefore that , if the impact of upgrades is assessed in terms of mass reach for new particles , the energy upgrade will be more powerful . for cases involving somewhat smaller masses , the luminosity upgrade could be more powerful _ provided that the detector performance can be maintained .",
    "_ in subsequent sections , various high @xmath21 physics cases are studied ranging from qcd to extra - dimensions .",
    "finally some conclusions are drawn .",
    "for qcd studies at an upgraded lhc , a comparison of the reach in jet transverse momenta was carried out using a nlo calculation of the inclusive jet cross section @xcite .",
    "the expected number of events with a jet above a transverse energy threshold is shown in figure  [ jets ] . requiring that there be 1000 events above a threshold , the accessible @xmath22 is shown in table  [ jettab ] .",
    "this comparison clearly shows the advantage of increasing the center - of - mass energy to 28 tev over a 10-fold increase in luminosity . in the former case",
    ", the reach extends by about 2 tev , larger by a factor of four than in the latter case .",
    "as the measurements involve the calorimeters only and only jets in the tev range are of interest , the detector performance is not expected to be degraded significantly at the highest luminosity .",
    "signals for quark compositeness should reveal themselves in deviations of the high energy part of the jet cross - section from the qcd expectation . the angular distribution of dijet pairs of large invariant mass provides an independent diagnostic and is less sensitive to possible non - linearities in the calorimeter response ( see section 21.5 of ref  @xcite for more details on the methodology ) .",
    "it was therefore used in this study .",
    "figure  [ comp1 ] shows the distribution for dijet events in the variable @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the angle between a jet and the beam in the center - of - mass frame of the dijet system .",
    "the invariant mass of the dijet system is required to be more than 10.5 tev",
    ". shown is the deviation from the expected form in the standard model for various values of the compositeness scale @xmath25 at @xmath26 tev .",
    "the effect of compositeness shows up as an increase in the event rate at small values of @xmath27 .",
    "the compositeness scales that can be probed in this manner are shown in table  [ comptab ] . as this comparison of the scenarios",
    "is based on the production of the very highest energy particles , the energy upgrade more sensitive .",

    "the higgs physics discovery program will largely be completed before any upgrade . following the discovery",
    ", the measurement of the mass will have reached the systematic limit , whereas measurements of couplings will be limited by the available statistics and could benefit from an upgrade .",
    "the following final states are expected to be observable depending upon the mass : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the relevant production processes are @xmath33 ( the vector boson fusion process ) which depends upon the @xmath34 and @xmath35 couplings , @xmath36 via a loop involving , in particular , top quarks , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 which is sensitive to the @xmath39 coupling . studies of the expected precision for the benchmark lhc @xcite have been extended for the upgrade scenarios . the expected precision on the production rates is shown in figures  [ karl1 ] and [ karl2 ] . in these plots",
    "it is assumed that there is an error of 5% on the measurement of the absolute luminosity . in some cases",
    "this becomes the limiting factor .",
    "figure  [ karl1 ] shows the measurements for final states containing gauge bosons produced by the gluon - gluon fusion process .",
    "figure  [ karl2 ] shows that for the other processes . in the mass range below 200 gev which is favored by fits to electroweak data @xcite , there are a large number of possible measurements .",
    "the factor of ten increase in luminosity over the standard lhc scenario improves the precision by approximately a factor of two and brings many of these measurements to the point where they are limited by the uncertainty on the measurement of the luminosity and other systematic effects .",
    "in particular , we have assumed that the measurement of @xmath40 final state does not improve at very high luminosity due to the difficulties of reconstructing these states .",
    "also the @xmath41 final state is compromised by the background as it has no mass peak and the uncertainty in the shape of this background contributes to the uncertainty .",
    "once these cross - section measurements are made , they can be used to extract information on the couplings of the higgs boson . in the case where measurements of different final states are made from the _ same _ higgs production mechanism ,",
    "a direct measurement of the ratios of higgs couplings is possible .",
    "figure  [ karl3 ] shows the expected precision on the ratio of the higgs partial widths to the @xmath41 and @xmath42 final states . for masses greater than approximately 160 gev measurements of @xmath43 and @xmath44 rates from the same production process enables a direct ( model independent ) measurement to be made . at smaller masses",
    "the process @xmath45 has too low a rate but an indirect measurement can be obtained by combining the measured rates for @xmath43 and @xmath46 and making a theoretical assumption . the coupling @xmath46 is dominated by a loop graph with an intermediate @xmath47 and hence the rate @xmath46 can be related to the @xmath34 coupling .",
    "measurements of the fermion couplings shown in figure  [ karl4 ] are more difficult .",
    "events with @xmath48 and @xmath49 and tagged forward jets arise from the same production process ( @xmath33 ) and hence can be combined to directly measure @xmath50 as shown in figure  [ karl4 ] .",
    "the coupling @xmath51 can be probed by comparing the @xmath52 and @xmath46 rates .",
    "the latter production rate is determined by the coupling of higgs to gluon pairs and the dominant contribution to this coupling is from a top quark loop which probes the @xmath51 coupling strength .",
    "an indirect measurement of the ratio of couplings @xmath34 and @xmath51 can therefore be made and is shown on figure  [ karl4 ] similarly the final states @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be combined to give the ratio of widths to @xmath32 and @xmath41 shown as an indirect measurement in figure  [ karl4 ] . again",
    "the increased luminosity improves the precision of the measurements by approximately a factor of two .    if the energy of the lhc were raised to 28 tev , then for a higgs boson of mass @xmath55 gev ( @xmath56 tev ) , the higgs production cross - section would rise by a factor of 2 ( 8) .",
    "therefore , in the case of higgs masses at the lower end of the search range , the luminosity upgrade is much more powerful .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that the full detector functionality and performance must be maintained at the upgraded luminosity if this advantage is to be exploited .    in the case of susy higgs bosons",
    "there are regions of the mssm parameter space where only the lightest higgs state ( @xmath57 ) will have been seen at lhc . in this case",
    "the sensitivity to the heavier higgs states via for the decays @xmath58 and @xmath59 will be increased at an upgraded lhc . in the case of @xmath60",
    "gev the energy upgrade increases the h / a cross - section by approximately a factor of five thereby increasing the discovery potential for heavy higgs bosons .",
    "perhaps the strongest argument for weak scale susy is that it allows light higgs bosons without unnatural fine tuning in the presence of much heavier scales such as the planck mass .",
    "while the concept of fine tuning is not precise , there is a general consensus that this requires susy particles to be lighter than about @xmath61 ; see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "masses in this range are also consistent with grand unification , cold dark matter , an observable susy contribution to @xmath62  @xcite , and a variety of other constraints  @xcite .    if @xmath63 parity is conserved , all susy particles decay to the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) @xmath64 , which escapes the detector .",
    "thus , the production of gluinos or squarks provides signatures with multiple jets , possibly leptons , and missing transverse energy @xmath65 . in typical susy breaking scenarios such as minimal sugra @xcite",
    ", the lhc should discover evidence for gluinos or squarks up to @xmath61 in the @xmath66 channel with an integrated luminosity of @xmath67 or less ; the ultimate discovery reach for @xmath68 extends beyond @xmath69 .",
    "the increase in mass reach for squarks and gluinos at higher lhc energy is evaluated approximately by comparing the squark and gluino production cross - sections at 14 and 28 tev .",
    "the primary standard model backgrounds , @xmath70 production and w / z+jets increase due to the larger center of mass energy . however , this effect will be more than compensated by the harder cuts on the transverse energy flow and missing @xmath22 in the events which can be applied compared to the analysis performed for a 14 tev collider .",
    "the cross - section was evaluated at leading order using the program prospino @xcite with cteq4l@xcite structure functions .",
    "three scenarios were considered : , , .",
    "the total cross section for the production of squarks and gluinos is given in the figures  [ gg ] , [ qq ] and [ qg ] as a function of the mass of the lighter sparticle be it squark or gluino in these scenarios .",
    "an approximation of the reach at 28 tev is obtained by taking the masses for which the signal cross - section is equal to the one for the maximum reachable masses at 14  tev@xcite , _ i.e. _ around @xmath71 pb for 100 fb@xmath18 .",
    "the approximate susy mass reach for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath18 at 28 tev is thus : 3.9  tev for @xmath72 , 2.7  tev for , and 2.9 tev for , which corresponds to an approximate doubling of the accessible mass range .",
    "an increase in the luminosity is somewhat less powerful as can be seen from table  [ susytab ] , but it still provides a mass reach 20% higher than the standard lhc scenario reaching 2.7 tev for the case @xmath72 .",
    "fb@xmath18 & 1000 fb@xmath18 & 100 fb@xmath18 & 1000 fb@xmath18@xmath72 & 2.1 & 2.7 & 3.9 & 4.4@xmath73 & 2.0&2.3&2.7 & 4.2 @xmath74 & 1.9 & 2.2 & @xmath75 & 4.1    given the naturalness arguments made above it is almost guaranteed that susy will be discovered at the baseline lhc if it is relevant to the problem of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , the role of an lhc upgrade in energy , luminosity , or both would be to complete the spectrum and make additional precise measurements .",
    "what measurements might be of interest many years after the first discovery of susy is of course model dependent and difficult to predict .",
    "it seems likely , however , that these measurements will require the full capability of atlas including good identification and measurements of @xmath76 s , @xmath77 s , @xmath78 s , jets , @xmath79-jets , and @xmath65 .",
    "while gauginos are likely to be lighter than @xmath61 , sfermions might be heavier . in the `` inverted hierarchy '' scenario  @xcite ,",
    "all scalars are heavy at the gut scale . with appropriate gut boundary conditions",
    "the renormalization group equations drive the third generation sfermions below @xmath61 but leave the rest heavy , perhaps several tev . in the `` focus point '' scenario  @xcite , even the stops ( @xmath80 ) can have multi - tev masses . in scenarios",
    "like these , gluinos and their decay products would still be discovered quickly at the lhc , but some or all of the squarks and sleptons would be inaccessible . a search for very massive squarks might impose fewer constraints on the detector performance than precision measurements at very high luminosity , but no simulation has been done .",
    "models with very massive sfermions often lead to many competing gluino decay modes , each with a small branching ratio .",
    "precision measurements of gluino processes at the lhc could be rate limited and might also benefit by an upgrade .",
    "sugra point  2 from @xcite was chosen as an example of the possible gains for susy studies from an energy or luminosity upgrade of the lhc .",
    "this point has @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , giving gluino and squark masses of about @xmath61 . while discovery of a signal in the @xmath66 channel is straightforward , the precision measurements discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite were relatively difficult .",
    "the channel @xmath85 , @xmath86 was not used because of the small rate as can be seen in fig .",
    "20 - 25 of ref  @xcite which shows an inclusive sample of 70 events for an integrated luminosity of @xmath87",
    ". a luminosity upgrade would clearly result in an event sample large enough to do a detailed study provided the detector performance can be maintained . at @xmath88 the total susy production cross section is increased to @xmath89 from @xmath90 at 14 tev showing that in this example the luminosity and energy upgrades are almost the same in their effect on the production rates . in an attempt to exploit the larger event rates ,",
    "events were selected with cuts similar to those used in @xcite using isajet 7.51 @xcite :    * at least 4 jets with @xmath91 ; * @xmath92 ; * @xmath93 ; * @xmath94 .    where @xmath95 and @xmath96 is the transverse sphericity .",
    "standard model backgrounds were not generated , but they should be small after these cuts are made , as shown in @xcite .",
    "leptons ( @xmath76,@xmath77 ) were required to have @xmath97 and to be isolated with @xmath98 in a cone of @xmath99 around the lepton direction . the dilepton mass distribution with these cuts is shown in fig .  [ c228mll ] .",
    "the @xmath100 peak now has more than 500 events for an integrated luminosity of @xmath101 @xmath102 .",
    "thus either the energy or luminosity upgrade produces an event sample large enough to perform further analyses .    for example",
    ", the main source of @xmath103 at point 2 is @xmath104 .",
    "the two hardest jets in susy events are expected to come from @xmath105 decays . the @xmath106 mass distribution formed by combining the two leptons in the @xmath107 mass peak with each of the two hardest jets",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ c228mllq ] .",
    "the smaller of these masses should be less than the kinematic upper limit for @xmath108 , while the larger should be greater than the kinematic lower limit .",
    "these distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ c228mllqmn ] . in either upgrade scenario",
    "the statistics are sufficient to make measurements that significantly constrain the squark and @xmath103 masses in a manner that would not be possible with the baseline lhc .",
    "the presence of jets at large rapidity can be used to enhance the signal - to - background ratio in certain processes such as those involving @xmath41 fusion where the @xmath47 s are emitted from quarks ( see , for example , 19.2.10.1 of ref @xcite ) . similarly",
    "the absence of jets at central rapidity can be used to enhance processes involving the production of particles with only electroweak charges relative to the production of strongly coupled particles ( see , for example , section 19.2.10.2 of ref @xcite ) .",
    "as the luminosity increases both of these selections are expected to become less useful as the pile - up of additional events can cause jets to appear in these regions as well as degrading the measurements of the jets used for tagging / vetoing .",
    "an estimate of the effects was obtained using a full simulation study of pileup in the atlas detector .",
    "pileup from the appropriate number of minimum bias events in up to 25 beam crossings before and 3 beam crossings after @xmath109 was generated , taking into account the response of the different calorimeters .",
    "jets were then found using a jet finder with cone size @xmath110 or @xmath111 , and assigned to ranges of rapidity    * forward : @xmath112 * backward : @xmath113 * central : @xmath114    a single tag is defined as an event with either a forward or backward jet ; a double tag has both . the probability of an event consisting only of minimum bias interactions having either a single or double jet tag is shown in figure  [ jjtag ] as a function of the jet energy .",
    "the probability of an event having an additional central jet is shown in figure  [ cjv ] as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "the values plotted in these figures are approximate , and depend sensitively on jet energy calibration and reconstruction conditions . at a luminosity of @xmath19 @xmath17",
    "sec@xmath18 the pile up of minimum bias events renders forward jet tagging and central jet vetoing difficult .",
    "the performance that is assumed here may be too pessimistic as it may be possible to reduce the pile - up noise in the lar calorimeter by using optimal filtering techniques at the upgraded luminosity @xcite and optimizing the jet algorithm . at an energy of 28 tev , the average number of minimum bias events increases by about 15% and",
    "the energies and multiplicities of particles in these events is higher . in this case , as a rough approximation , it will be assumed that the rates of fake forward jet tags and of extra central jets are twice as big as at nominal luminosity .",
    "this tagging result has implications for strong @xmath41 scattering signals as is now discussed .",
    "if there is no light higgs boson , then general arguments@xcite imply that scattering of electroweak gauge bosons at high energy will show structure beyond that expected in the standard model . in order to explore such signals",

    "the signal is characterized by two parameters , the number of extra dimensions @xmath166 and the scale @xmath167 characterizing the scale of gravity .",
    "table  [ extradtab ] shows the maximum value of @xmath167 that can be detected for a given value of @xmath166 in the four scenarios .",

    "an increase in the integrated luminosity by a factor of 10 raises the reach by approximately 30% .",
    "if a signal is observed at 14 tev , the energy increase is such that model dependent signals can be expected to be observed at 28 tev .",
    "such observations would therefore provide valuable insight into the dynamics of the underlying theory .",
    "detector performance is not expected to be critical as events with jets and missing energy in the tev range are relevant for this search .",
    "as an example of the impact of the possible upgrades , figure [ zprime ] shows the production rate for @xmath168 final states arising from the decay of a @xmath169 gauge boson with the same couplings to quarks and leptons as the standard model @xmath107 as a function of the mass of the @xmath169 .",
    "the final state @xmath170 is not considered , because it is more difficult to exploit at the highest luminosity particularly if the tracker is not upgraded .",
    "the calorimeter can still be used to detect this channel but the signs of the electrons can not be determined and measurements of asymmetries can not be undertaken .",
    "if this channel were included and had the same acceptance as the muon channel , the mass reach would increase by approximately 20% .",
    "the discovery limit for @xmath171 is given in table  [ zprime - tab ] from which it can be seen that the combination of energy and luminosity upgrade doubles the mass reach .",
    "fb@xmath18 & 100 fb@xmath18 & 1000 fb@xmath184.5 & 5.4 & 7.0 & 9.5    the decay @xmath172 ( see section 21.6.1.4 of @xcite ) has also been studied .",
    "this channel is not competitive for discovery but can provide important information on the couplings of the @xmath169 .",
    "this study uses the final state where the lepton is a muon , as electron detection will be more difficult at higher luminosity .",

    "@xcite discuss signals for new exotic quarks .",
    "some of these studies have been repeated for the upgrade scenarios .",
    "the decays @xmath173 and @xmath174 have been simulated .",
    "figures  [ excite1 ] and [ excite2 ] show the statistical significance of the signal in these channels as a function of the excited quark mass in the @xmath175 and @xmath176 final states .",
    "the mass reach increases by about 4 tev for the highest energy / luminosity configuration . as only jets and photons of the very highest transverse energy are needed in the analysis , this process is rather robust even at the very highest luminosity .",
    "the final state @xmath177 ( @xmath178 ) has been used to probe the couplings @xmath179 and @xmath180 ( @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 ) that describe the @xmath184 ( @xmath185 ) interaction vertex .",
    "more details of the methodology can be found in section 16.2 of @xcite . for a luminosity of @xmath19 @xmath17 sec@xmath18 ,",
    "the analysis reported here uses only muons and photons .",
    "this represents a loss of 50% ( 75% ) of the @xmath186 ( @xmath139 ) effective rate .",
    "the constraints on the @xmath187 couplings arise primarily from the angular distributions whereas those on the @xmath188 couplings arise from the transverse momentum distributions . as only the latter",
    "are used here , the results are pessimistic in the case of the @xmath187 couplings .",
    "the expected sensitivity is shown in table  [ triple - tab ] and the correlations in fig .",
    "[ triple ] .",
    "note that both the energy or luminosity upgrades extend the sensitivity for @xmath179 into the range ( @xmath189 0.001 ) expected from radiative corrections in the standard model and should allow a meaningful test of these corrections and others that arise for example in supersymmetric models .",
    "in contrast to most of the other examples discussed , the luminosity increase is more powerful than the energy increase in this case .",

    "although there are other processes where some impact from the upgrades can be expected and which have not been studied , this survey of physics processes at an upgraded lhc enables one to draw certain conclusions .    without major detector upgrades ,",
    "_ i.e. _ by using only final states of high @xmath21 jets , photons and muons , a luminosity upgrade is expected to provide a @xmath194% improvement in the mass reach for new physics as susy and extra - dimensions .",
    "this increase is significant for signals at the limit of the lhc sensitivity .",
    "however , the failure of the inner detector will compromise electron identification as well as b and hadronic @xmath78 tagging .",
    "for many new physics processes , statistical samples are improved by combining channels with electrons and muons .",
    "in addition valuable information about new physics can be obtained by looking for violation of @xmath195 universality .",
    "therefore major detector upgrades would be needed to exploit fully the factor of ten increase in luminosity .",
    "pile - up of minimum bias events has severe impact on the ability to use forward jet tagging and central jet vetoing as a tool to enhance signal to background ratios at luminosities significantly higher than @xmath16 @xmath17 sec@xmath18",
    ".    the energy upgrade would be much easier to exploit .",
    "it could significantly enhance the physics reach of the lhc by almost a factor of two in mass .",
    "in addition , if new physics is discovered , then the energy upgrade would allow significant further study of the new physics .",
