    "high - surface - brightness ( hsb ) elliptical galaxies are known to define a `` fundamental plane '' ( fp ) when represented in the logarithmic space of their effective radius @xmath0 , average surface brightness @xmath1 within @xmath0 , and central stellar velocity dispersion @xmath2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; fig .",
    "if elliptical galaxies had a constant mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) , then the physical base for the fp would be obvious because the virial theorem would imply a link between these three quantities .",
    "real galaxies , however , do not follow the plane defined by the virial theorem ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . finding an explanation for this unexpected behavior has been and still is one of the major puzzle in modern astrophysics . in a nutshell ,",
    "both possibilities of a systematic change of m / l with luminosity and departure from homology were fully investigated . in order to preserve the narrowness of the fp , the tilt can be explained fine tuning the amount of dark matter to the galaxy luminosity , or fine tuning the departures from homology to the galaxy size ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "of the two options the former is the most widely accepted , and the tilt ascribed to @xmath3 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "whatever the reason for the tilt is , both these possibilities face paramount difficulties as soon as low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) elliptical galaxies are considered , because these galaxies follows an inverse trend @xmath4 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it look like any classical picture conceived to explain the tilt of the fp defined by hsb , is deemed to fail with lsb , and vice versa . the goal of this work is to investigate whether a consistent explanation for the tilt of the fp and the opposite behavior of hsb and lsb galaxies can be ascribed to a completely different physical phenomenon .    in 1983 a modification of newtonian dynamics known as mond has been proposed as an alternative to non - baryonic dark matter ( milgrom 1983 ) .",
    "milgrom s proposal states that gravity ( or inertia ) does not follow the prediction of newtonian dynamics for acceleration smaller than @xmath5 cm  s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the true acceleration of gravity @xmath7 being related to the newtonian acceleration @xmath8 by    @xmath9    the interpolation function @xmath10 admits the asymptotic behavior @xmath11 for @xmath12 , so to retrieve the newtonian expression in the strong field regime , and @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "the constant @xmath15 is meant to be a new constant of physics .",
    "the transition from the newtonian to the mond regime occurs for values of acceleration that remain undetected within the solar system where the strong field of the sun ( of the order of @xmath16 cm  s@xmath6 at the distance of pluto ) dominates all dynamical processes . as a consequence , we have no direct proof of the validity of newton s law in the low acceleration regimes that are typical in galaxies .    since the seminal papers on mond @xcite , a few authors have worked on this subject showing how this simple idea explains many properties of galaxies without the need of non - baryonic dark matter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "mond is also effective in describing the dynamics of galaxy groups and clusters @xcite and , with some approximations , gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "clearly , mond applies to any stellar structure and therefore its effects should be visible also in elliptical galaxies . in this work , i shall study the fp within the contest of mond , to see if it is possible to explain both the tilt of the fp and the opposite behavior of lsb and hsb galaxies without the needs to invoke non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "if gravity deviates from newtonian prediction in the low acceleration regime typical of galaxies , then the logical implication is that the weaker the field , the bigger the deviation . with this in mind",
    ", the kormendy relation ( fig . [ kormendy ] ) assumes a new meaning because in elliptical galaxies @xmath1 ( or equivalently @xmath17 ) , is proportional to their internal acceleration of gravity . , where @xmath18 is the fraction of the total mass within @xmath0 .",
    "after substituting @xmath19 and @xmath20 we have @xmath21 . ]",
    "thus the trends followed by hsb and lsb galaxies in the @xmath22 plane can be seen as trends of their internal gravitational field .",
    "the opposite dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath0 observed in hsb and lsb then suggest these galaxies enter into mond regime in different ways and , as a result , should follow different fp . in order to use mond to verify",
    "if this is the case , the interpolation function @xmath23 must be specified .",
    "different but functionally equivalent expression for @xmath23 have been used in the literature ( milgrom 1983b , 1984 ; * ? ? ?",
    "currently the most used function , also adopted here , is :    @xmath24    which works well in describing galactic rotation curves and has the advantage of being simple .",
    "solving for @xmath7 the true acceleration of gravity reads    @xmath25^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    this expression allows the calculation of the true gravitational acceleration provided the newtonian one is known .    before proceeding to compute @xmath8",
    ", it is worth noticing that if @xmath26 is the true value of m / l of an object , and @xmath27 is the one derived using newton s law to convert accelerations to masses , then @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , imagine an acceleration @xmath7 is measured at distance @xmath29 from an object of luminosity @xmath30 . in mond",
    "we interpret this @xmath7 as due to a mass @xmath31=\\tau l$ ] , where the term @xmath32 $ ] is the factor @xmath33 defined in eq.3 . on the other hand , according to newton s law we infer a mass @xmath34",
    ". then the ratio @xmath35 = g/{g_{_{\\rm n}}}$ ] .",
    "thus , any difference between @xmath7 and @xmath8 will appear as a variation of @xmath26 .    to investigate these effects on elliptical galaxies ,",
    "i shall take as representative of each galaxy the acceleration of gravity @xmath36 at @xmath0 , computed setting @xmath26 from the stellar population typical of the galaxies and replacing the gravitational radius with @xmath0 . in absence of dark matter",
    "both assumptions are valid .",
    "the mass within @xmath0 is set to be @xmath37 of the total mass , as appropriate for galaxies following the @xmath38 de vaucouleurs law @xcite . under these assumptions ,",
    "the acceleration of gravity at @xmath0 becomes :    @xmath39,\\ ] ]    where the numerical constant is correct for @xmath26 and @xmath30 in solar units , and @xmath0 in pc .",
    "combining eq .",
    "3 and 4 one can compute @xmath33 for all galaxies .",
    "before proceeding with the calculation of @xmath36 , i have to set the value of @xmath26 .",
    "since i am assuming newton s law fails below @xmath15 , masses derived using any dynamical model based on this law can obviously not be used here .",
    "stellar evolution theories , which potentially provide the best tools for computing @xmath26 , give results that critically depend on the adopted initial mass function ( imf ) and the low masses cutoff .",
    "these parameters are rather uncertain and imply large differences on the derived @xmath26 .",
    "for instance , for a single coeval stellar population , assuming a single - slope salpeter imf with slope 2.35 , @xmath26 changes by a factor 4.5 varying the low masses cutoff from 0.15 to 0.05 m@xmath40 .",
    "note that this problem is only mildly alleviated using a more realistic multi - slope imf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at low masses",
    "@xcite .    an unbiased way to estimate @xmath26 relies on the analysis of the stars in the solar neighborhood , where stars of all spectral type in all possible evolutionary phases can be studied in great detail . from @xcite ,",
    "the total mass of stars in @xmath41 pc@xmath42 is 356m@xmath40 + 30m@xmath40 of white dwarfs . for this sample",
    "it is found @xmath43 .",
    "this sample of stars can be used to estimate @xmath26 for any stellar population simply integrating the light over all the relevant spectral types , while maintaining the total mass fixed .",
    "this will result in an upper limit to the true @xmath26 , because more than one generation of stars contributed to it and therefore the number of low mass stars is overrepresented .    in elliptical galaxies",
    "the stellar population is composed by stars in : sub - giant branch , red - giant branch , horizontal branch , and main sequence up to spectral type k. in @xmath41 pc@xmath42 there are 4 red giants of k type and 0.25 of m type populating the giant branch , which have average luminosity of 57 and 120 solar luminosities , respectively . for each star in the giant branch",
    "there are @xmath44 21 stars in the sub - giant branch and 0.75 in the horizontal branch @xcite , which contribute for 5 and 52 @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "stars still in the main sequence add another 18 @xmath45 .",
    "from these considerations it follows that @xmath46 .",
    "this value is consistent with that derived for globular clusters @xcite that have a similar old stellar population .",
    "these objects , however , are slightly different form elliptical galaxies because they do nt contain gas and at least a fraction of the less massive stars , which contributes to the mass but not to the luminosity , have probably left the clusters long ago ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so , for globular cluster @xmath47 should be fairly correct , while here i shall set @xmath48 for all elliptical galaxies . a fairly conservative assumption that allows for the presence of large amount of gas , particularly relevant in lsb galaxies .    for spiral galaxies , setting @xmath49 , that is about twice as big as that observed in the solar neighborhood , allows for plenty of gas and the bulge old stellar population .",
    "finally , for cluster of galaxies i assume a mix of spiral and ellipticals , with @xmath50 .",
    "i stress that the results reported in this work do not significantly depend on the assumed value of @xmath26 in the range 1 - 2 .",
    "i compute here the quantity @xmath51 and investigate its relation with @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and @xmath30 for a sample of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the representative data set for hsb galaxies is taken from the compilation of @xcite , to which i added data for 6 lsb and 11 dwarfs galaxies @xcite , 6 compact ellipticals @xcite , and 22 radio galaxies @xcite . throughout the paper , h@xmath52",
    "km s@xmath53 mpc@xmath53 is used .",
    "the acceleration @xmath36 at @xmath0 is found comparable to @xmath15 for hsb galaxies , while being well below this value in lsb .",
    "the effect of mond on objects characterized by different @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ g_sigma ] .",
    "it is seen that galaxies follow a continuous sequence implying the mass discrepancy , or in other word the dark matter content , is uniquely defined by @xmath1 .",
    "i shall show that this fact has important consequences for understanding why objects as different as globular and galaxy clusters may appear to have the same mass discrepancy .    in fig .",
    "[ g_sigma ] , hsb and lsb galaxies are no longer distinguishable because the opposite dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath0 ( see fig . [ kormendy ] ) disappears .",
    "the different behavior of hsb and lsb become evident when plotting @xmath33 versus @xmath0 or @xmath30 ( fig . [ msul_re ] and [ msul_lum ] ) .",
    "it is therefore clear that the effect of modified dynamics is to mimic an increase of @xmath26 as a function of @xmath30 for hsb galaxies , while doing the opposite for lsb galaxies .",
    "moreover , fig .",
    "[ msul_lum ] shows that with good approximation , and certainly within the spread of the data , the dependence on luminosity is @xmath54 for hsb galaxies , and @xmath55 for lsb galaxies , consistent with the values quoted in the literature @xcite .    the striking different behavior of hsb and lsb galaxies can therefore be easily explained by a unique model assuming a modification of newton s law . under this hypothesis",
    "the tilt of the fp is not due to a systematic increase / decrease of the dark matter content of galaxies , but it is the effect of the variation of the strength of their internal gravitational field as compared to @xmath15 .    another way to investigate the effect of mond on galaxies is shown in fig .",
    "[ mondexp ] , where the acceleration of gravity from eq .",
    "4 , is compared to the acceleration derived using the dynamical mass , @xmath56 . though there is significant spread of the data , it is seen that dynamical masses imply no mass discrepancy for acceleration stronger or comparable to @xmath15 , while a deviation is apparent when the acceleration goes below it , as prescribed by mond .",
    "note that the stronger discrepancy occurs for lsb galaxies , because they are in deep mond regime . while observational data and mond predictions agree reasonably well , to explain this behavior using newtonian dynamics requires fine tuning of the total amount of dark matter in galaxies of very different type and morphology .",
    "these considerations are not limited to elliptical galaxies .",
    "in fact if mond is the underlying law regulating gravity in the universe , then all stellar systems should be described by mond .",
    "though a full discussion of this issue goes beyond the scope of the present work , it is worth to add more data to fig .",
    "[ mondexp ] to see whether other stellar systems different from elliptical galaxies follow the same trend . in fig .",
    "[ burstein1 ] i plot the data from the data for 1050 objects ( 51 globular clusters , 300 elliptical galaxies , 513 spiral galaxies , 170 galaxy groups and 16 galaxy clusters ) from the compilation of @xcite , are plotted .",
    "data cover 7 order of magnitudes in internal acceleration , going from globular clusters which are believed to be dark matter free , to the largest cluster which have @xmath57 .",
    "the agreement between mond and the observed dependence of the mass discrepancy is clear and becomes striking after re - binning the data ( fig .",
    "[ burstein2 ] ) , indicating that either the dark - matter content in stellar structure is amazingly well linked to the strength of their internal gravitational field , or that newton s law fails below @xmath15 .",
    "i stress that under the latter explanation , it is clear that objects like globular clusters are baryons dominated not just for a coincidence but because their internal acceleration of gravity is above @xmath15 . and objects as different as a galaxy cluster and a tiny lsb dwarf galaxy have similarly large @xmath26 not for a pure coincidence but because their internal acceleration of gravity is similar .",
    "finally , i would like to comment on recent result for two globular clusters .",
    "observations of the stellar velocity dispersion of palomar 13 @xcite have been interpreted as evidence for large amount of dark matter in this cluster ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "similarly , my collaborators and i have shown that at large radii the velocity dispersion profile of @xmath59 centauri remains flat for accelerations below few times @xmath15 @xcite , as observed in galaxies .",
    "this result was interpreted as evidence of a failure of newton s law in the low acceleration limit , while the classical scenario would imply large amount of dark matter surrounding the cluster and therefore large mass discrepancy .",
    "i show in fig .",
    "[ mondexp ] that in both cases the clusters uniforms to mond prediction further supporting the proposed scenario .",
    "the most important conclusion of this work is that assuming mond the tilt of the fp can be explained by the different strength , as compared to @xmath15 , of the internal gravitational field in galaxies of different type and size .",
    "this suffice to show that using newton s law of gravity @xmath26 is expected to vary systematically with @xmath0 or , equivalently , with @xmath30 , in a way fully consistent with observations .",
    "the opposite behavior of hsb and lsb galaxies , which poses paramount difficulties for newtonian dynamics , also find a natural explanation in this scenario .",
    "the observed systematic deviation extends naturally to other stellar structures over 7 order of magnitude in acceleration , strongly suggesting that a law of physics , rather than dark matter , regulates the behavior of stellar structures in the universe .",
    "it is worth noticing that all this is achieved in mond without a single free parameter . +",
