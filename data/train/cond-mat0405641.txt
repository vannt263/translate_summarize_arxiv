    "atomistic models of crystal growth in molecular beam epitaxy and similar techniques continue to attract considerable interest , see for example @xcite for overviews , a very brief introduction is given in @xcite , this volume .",
    "many interesting aspects of epitaxial growth can be discussed for the case of homoepitaxy where only one material is present .",
    "this includes the deposition of , for instance , a metal or a semiconductor compound on a matching substrate crystal .",
    "the term heteroepitaxial crystal growth refers to situations , where the deposited adsorbate material differs from the substrate",
    ". the mismatch can be quite fundamental , as for instance in the growth of organic films upon metal substrates .",
    "perhaps the most frequent and , certainly , the conceptually simplest situation is that where adsorbate and substrate would crystallize in the same type of lattice , but with slightly different lattice spacings .",
    "the latter case is of particular relevance in the fabrication of semiconductor heterostructures for potential technical applications , such as modern opto - electronic or storage devices .",
    "prominent examples are the deposition of ge on si , inas on gaas , or cdte on znse .",
    "frequently , the aim is to produce a smooth adsorbate film of a well defined thickness on a given substrate .",
    "however , the misfit induced strain can perturb the lattice structure and result in , e.g. , dislocations which reduce the quality of the film drastically .    on the other hand , mechanisms of strain relaxation",
    "can also be exploited in epitaxial growth .",
    "the most prominent example is perhaps the self - organized formation of multilayered islands in the so  called stranski - krastanov growth mode @xcite .",
    "the ideal process would yield dislocation - free three - dimensional objects of well defined size and shape which furthermore display spatial ordering .",
    "these so  called quantum dots can capture single or few electrons and may play the role of _ artificial atoms _ in a novel type of solid - state - lasers , for example . for a recent overview of the many interesting experimental and theoretical aspects of quantum dot physics ,",
    "see @xcite .    besides the obvious technological relevance of heteroepitaxial growth , it is also highly interesting from a theoretical point of view .",
    "the self - assembly of dots might be considered a prototype example of self - organized ordering processes .",
    "heteroepitaxy remains furthermore a challenge in the design of growth models and the development of novel simulation techniques .",
    "the natural tool for mismatched heteroepitaxy appears to be molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite or quantum mechanical variations thereof , e.g.   @xcite .",
    "this very attractive but computationally demanding approach is discussed in the general context of epitaxial growth in @xcite ( k. albe , this volume ) , see @xcite for an example application in the context of dislocation formation .",
    "whereas modern computers allow for the simulation of very large systems , the most serious limitation of the md technique remains : the physical time intervals that can be targeted are generally quite small , e.g. on the order of picoseconds .",
    "mbe relevant time scales of seconds or even minutes do not seem feasible currently , even when applying highly sophisticated acceleration techniques as in @xcite .",
    "in simplifying lattice gas models , the particles can only be placed exactly at pre - defined sites . nevertheless , it is possible to incorporate certain misfit effects into such models .",
    "in fact , some of the earliest kmc simulations were performed in the context of strained heteroepitaxial crystal growth @xcite .",
    "so  called _ ball and spring _ models consider additional harmonic interactions , i.e.  _ springs _ , between adsorbate or substrate atoms at neighboring lattice sites , see @xcite and @xcite for more recent examples . in other approaches ,",
    "continuum elasticity theory is applied to evaluate the contribution and influence of strain for a given configuration of the lattice @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "however , traditional lattice based models can not cope with the emergence of defects or dislocations in a straightforward fashion . in the following",
    "we will discuss an off - lattice model and the corresponding kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) technique , which allows for continuous particle positions and in which strain results directly from the atomic interactions .",
    "schindler and wolf have essentially formulated the model and simulation method in @xcite , and some of the results presented here have been published previously in @xcite . for a detailed description of the concept and its applications see also @xcite .",
    "the method incorporates the essential features of hetero - epitaxy in a natural way , and , at the same time , enables us to perform simulations over reasonable physical time scales .",
    "in contrast to earlier realizations of similar concepts , see e.g.@xcite , we are also able to simulate the growth of rather thick films over a wide range of misfits .    in section [ model ] we will define the model and describe the simulation technique .",
    "we briefly discuss the role of misfit dislocations as a mechanism for strain relaxation and present our simulation results in section [ dislocations ] .",
    "section [ stranski ] summarizes our investigations of the stranski - krastanov growth mode and in section [ outlook ] we conclude with a brief outlook on perspective investigations .",
    "in the following , we address quite fundamental and general aspects of heteroepitaxy , rather than the properties of specific material systems .",
    "hence , the primary goal is to develop a fairly simple model which still captures the essential features of a mismatched growth situation .",
    "following several previous studies @xcite , we choose a pair potential ansatz to model interactions between the particles . to begin with",
    ", we consider a lennard - jones ( lj ) system @xcite .",
    "a strong repulsive term at small distances competes with an attractive contribution in the potential @xmath1.\\ ] ] the relative distance @xmath2 of particles @xmath3 and @xmath4 varies continuously with their position in space . by choice of the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 we can specify the different material properties in our model : interactions between two substrate or adsorbate atoms",
    "are given by the sets @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . in principle , an independent set of parameters would define the interaction of substrate with adsorbate atoms . in order to keep the number of parameters small , we follow a standard approach and set @xmath9 for the inter - species potential .    the potential energy of two isolated atoms that interact via ( [ lj ] ) is minimal for @xmath10 .",
    "accordingly , the lattice spacing in a lennard - jones crystal is proportional ( and close ) to @xmath6 as well .",
    "the relative lattice misfit in our model is therefore directly controlled by choice of @xmath11 and @xmath12 : @xmath13 essential features and several principled questions can already be studied in the simplifying framework of @xmath0-dimensional growth , where particles are deposited on a one - dimensional surface . for the simulations presented here we have prepared , at least , 6 layers of substrate particles , each containing @xmath14 particles .",
    "the system sizes vary between @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the following , depending on the computational costs of the considered problem .",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions in the lateral direction and fix the particle positions in the bottom layer in order to stabilize the crystal .    in our simulations of the growth kinetics ,",
    "adsorbate particles are deposited at a constant rate @xmath17 as measured in monolayers per second @xmath18 .",
    "desorption events will be completely suppressed here as they would be very unlikely anyway .",
    "only adsorbate particles at the surface are considered mobile in the sense that they perform diffusion hops and the like .",
    "however , bulk crystal adsorbate and substrate atoms will be due to relaxation processes which modify their spatial positions and relative distances without changing the topology .",
    "the most distinctive feature of the method is the treatment of thermally activated processes , for which we assume arrhenius like rates , see @xcite . in lattice gas models ,",
    "particles are moved from one site to another with a rate which usually depends on a small neighborhood only . in the off - lattice approach",
    "any event concerns the entire configuration and its rate depends on all particle coordinates , in principle . at a given time , the system resides in a local minimum of the total potential energy of the @xmath19 particles : @xmath20 a possible event @xmath21 takes the system to one of the neighboring minima in configuration space and for any such change the corresponding energy barrier @xmath22 and rate @xmath23 has to be evaluated by means of a so - called molecular statics calculation , see @xcite for examples and further references .    in a most general setting the identification of potential events , i.e. the relevant energy minima , can be difficult @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional situation simplifies these calculations to a large extent .",
    "figure [ schwoebel ] illustrates the procedure : the single particle on top of the terraced surface is virtually moved to the right , along the @xmath24-coordinate in the illustration . for every fixed value of @xmath24 , the total energy ( [ etot ] ) can be ( locally ) minimized with respect to the moving atom s @xmath25-coordinate and the positions of all other atoms including the substrate . in doing so",
    ", one can evaluate a potential energy surface ( pes ) as displayed in fig .",
    "[ schwoebel ] .",
    "of course it is not necessary to scan the pes continuously for the arrhenius rates , as only the energies in the initial state and the transition state are relevant .",
    "the latter corresponds to a maximum in the figure , i.e. a saddle point in the energy as a function of all coordinates . in more complex situations like @xmath26-dim .",
    "growth it is also possible to determine saddle points in a pes by iterative gradient based methods @xcite .",
    "however , the identification of the physical path from one minimum to the next can be much more involved in general , e.g.  for concerted moves in @xmath26 dimensions .",
    "note that the @xmath0-dim .",
    "system displays a strong ehrlich - schwoebel effect @xcite : hops from a terrace are hindered by a barrier which relates to the very weakly bound transition state right at the edge .",
    "the effect is also present , but much weaker in a @xmath26-dim .",
    "fcc - system , for instance . there",
    ", a descending particle can follow a more favorable path _ between _ neighboring particles at the edge .    for large misfits , exchange processes at terrace or island edges may become more frequent than downward hopping diffusion .",
    "we have checked that for the values of @xmath27 considered in the following , exchange diffusion can be neglected , in general .",
    "the precise barriers , however , depend in a subtle way on the misfit , the island size , and the properties of the actual interaction potential . for details",
    "we refer to @xcite and forthcoming publications .",
    "further simplifications may be used here .",
    "first , because the lj - potential ( [ lj ] ) is very weak for distances @xmath28 , one can effectively cut - off the interactions and consider only particles in a corresponding neighborhood region when evaluating the pes of a particular event .",
    "the so - called _ frozen crystal approximation _ should be employed with care : in this scheme all coordinates but those of the moving atom are considered fixed , which significantly simplifies the saddle point search .",
    "although the scheme appears to impose a drastic restriction , it has been reported by various authors that its main effect in the lj - system is a uniform shift of all barriers by roughly 10% @xcite .    in our simulations ,",
    "exchange diffusion and multiple jumps have been neglected .",
    "we consider only hops to the left or right neighboring minimum in the pes . given a configuration of the system",
    ", we set up a catalogue of all these diffusion events and evaluate their rates @xmath29    \\qquad \\mbox{~with~ } \\qquad \\nu_o = 10^{12 } /s\\ ] ] with @xmath22 obtained as described above .    for simplicity , we choose a constant pre - factor or _ attempt frequency _",
    "@xmath30 for all diffusion processes , see @xcite for a brief discussion and references .",
    "next , one of the diffusion or deposition processes is chosen with a probability proportional to its rate . in order to facilitate an efficient book - keeping and fast search ,",
    "events are stored in a binary search tree , see @xcite and references therein . after performing the particular process",
    ", the catalogue of rates has to be updated and re - evaluated .",
    "obviously this task consumes a large portion of the computing power . nevertheless , the rejection - free method is advantageous over a rejection - based simulation @xcite .",
    "approximations and numerical inaccuracies , and even more so the use of the _ frozen crystal _ picture , result in deformations of the crystal and the accumulation of artificial strain energy . in order to avoid this effect",
    ", a relaxation of the system should be performed after each event , in the sense that the configuration is taken to the nearest local minimum of @xmath31 . in practice",
    "we perform after each diffusion or deposition a _ local _",
    "relaxation within a radius @xmath32 about the location of the event .",
    "the full _ global _ procedure is applied only after a certain number of events , which is decreased whenever the relaxation changes the barriers by more than , say , a few percent .    in the following sections we discuss applications in the context of two different mechanisms of strain relaxation .",
    "their peculiarities require certain extensions and modifications .",
    "however , the basic concepts and essential ingredients have been outlined above .",
    "if the misfit is relatively small in heteroepitaxial growth , one frequently observes the initial growth of a _ pseudomorphic _ film . here the substrate determines the lateral lattice constant also in the adsorbate and strain energy accumulates in the growing film . on the other hand , for very thick adsorbate films far away from the substrate ,",
    "one clearly expects to find a lattice structure and spacing as in the undisturbed bulk material .",
    "the ultimate relaxation of strain is through misfit dislocations , lattice defects which allow the adsorbate to assume its natural lattice structure , eventually . here",
    "we address the question of how the transition from strained pseudomorphic to relaxed adsorbate growth occurs and how the lattice spacing evolves with the film thickness .    in the frame of our model",
    "we choose the same potential depth for all types of interactions , which defines the energy scale . by identifying @xmath33 with the value @xmath34 ,",
    "for instance , we obtain a barrier of @xmath35 for surface diffusion in the case of zero misfit .",
    "the substrate temperature was set to @xmath36 which is well below the melting temperature of a monoatomic lennard - jones crystal .",
    "all results presented in this section were obtained with the deposition rate @xmath37 .",
    "dislocations can be identified by constructing voronoy polyhedra and searching for particles with a coordination number different from six in the bulk .",
    "further information is obtained from a burgers construction , see @xcite for details .    in our earlier investigations",
    "presented in @xcite we considered positive and negative values of the misfit parameter in the range @xmath38 . for large absolute values of @xmath27",
    "the system displays the formation of misfit dislocations right at or very close to the substrate / adsorbate interface , cf .",
    "[ manydisl ] .",
    "the slightly oversimplifying picture is that , initially , separated islands or mounds grow on the substrate and dislocations emerge where they meet .",
    "these are then overgrown by the deposited material .",
    "diffusion of dislocations by concerted moves of the surrounding particles are highly improbable in the lj - system and for the low temperatures considered here .",
    "we find a mean distance between dislocations very close to @xmath39 which directly reflects the _ relative periodicity _ of the two lattices involved .    for smaller misfits , one observes a more interesting evolution of the surface : initially , a pseudomorphic adsorbate film grows with the same mean lateral atomic distances @xmath40 as in the substrate . at a rather well defined film thickness ,",
    "misfit dislocations appear everywhere on the surface , which are later overgrown .",
    "snapshots of the surface evolution in the vicinity of a single dislocation are shown in figure [ dislforms ] for @xmath41 .    in our most recent studies of the low misfit regime ,",
    "we have slightly amended the model in comparison with section [ model ] .",
    "deposited particles perform a so - called _ downhill funneling _ upon arrival at the surface : it is assumed that its kinetic energy enables an arriving atom to move to the lowest position in the vicinity of the deposition site .",
    "similar incorporation effects , which are clearly not thermally activated , are discussed in @xcite ( this volume ) and in greater detail in @xcite .",
    "the funneling process smoothens the surface by reducing the effect of the strong schwoebel barrier in the system .",
    "it hence allows for the simulation of thicker films without a pronounced mound structure as , for instance , in fig .",
    "[ manydisl ] .",
    "note , however , that our findings are to a large extent robust with respect to such modifications .    for positive misfits",
    "the adsorbate is laterally compressed and it reacts by assuming a vertical lattice spacing @xmath42 which is larger than in its undisturbed bulk . a simple consideration yields for small @xmath27 in the lj - system a vertical spacing @xmath43 of the atomic layers in the pseudomorphic film .",
    "after misfit dislocations have emerged , the adsorbate approaches its relaxed undisturbed bulk structure , as indicated by the decrease of @xmath42 with the film thickness .",
    "figure [ aperp ] shows the result of our simulations on average over 10 independent runs for system sizes of at least @xmath44 and misfits in the range @xmath45 .",
    "the qualitative evolution of @xmath42 agrees with novel measurements of this quantity in experimental studies of ii - vi - semiconductor heteroepitaxy @xcite . in a forthcoming publication",
    "the comparison with experimental data will be presented in greater detail .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result in this context concerns the _ critical _ film thickness @xmath46 at which the dislocations appear in the system . in fig .",
    "[ aperp ] , it is marked by the deviation of @xmath42 from its initial value .",
    "the rescaling of the thickness with @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ aperp ] shows a relatively good collapse of the curves in the relevant phase of growth .",
    "it is by no means our intention to suggest that , here , a true _",
    "dynamical scaling law _ exists as in , e.g. , kinetic roughening @xcite .",
    "the small range of considered misfits would certainly not allow for such a claim .",
    "nevertheless , our data is consistent with a critical thickness of the form @xmath48 in the previous study of a slightly modified model we considered a different measure of the critical film thickness @xcite .",
    "there , we found the same power law behavior for positive and negative misfits in a much wider range of misfits .",
    "preliminary studies yield the same qualitative result for the model with other pair potentials in place of the lennard - jones interactions .",
    "hence we believe that the observed dependence is robust with respect to details of the model and displays a certain degree of universality .",
    "note that the power law behavior ( [ powerlaw ] ) disagrees with the results of energy or force balance considerations , as for instance the well - known and widely accepted relation derived by matthews and blakeslee @xcite .",
    "one can argue , however , that the dislocation formation as observed here is a kinetic phenomenon far from equilibrium .",
    "indeed , alternative approaches as suggested by cohen - solal and co - workers predict the power law dependence ( [ powerlaw ] ) for the critical thickness @xcite .",
    "furthermore , experimental data for several iv - iv , iii - v , and ii - vi semiconductor systems shows very good agreement with the hypothesized power law @xcite .",
    "dislocations : development of the vertical layer spacing in the model with _ downhill funneling _ , see text , with increasing film height for various values of the misfit .",
    "results were obtained on average over 10 independent simulation runs and the spacing @xmath42 is rescaled by its initial value .",
    "the scaling of the film thickness is according to eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) and results in a relatively good collapse of the curves close to the critical thickness . ]    in forthcoming investigations we will study the dependence of the surface evolution on the temperature and deposition rate . this should provide further evidence for the robustness of relation ( [ powerlaw ] ) and for the interpretation of misfit induced dislocation formation as an activated process .",
    "obviously , dislocations should dominate the strain relaxation in sufficiently thick films and for large misfits . in material systems with relatively small mismatch",
    "an alternative effect governs the initial growth of very thin films : instead of growing layer by layer , the adsorbate aggregates in three - dimensional structures , allowing for partial relaxation .",
    "the term _ 3d - islands _ is used to indicate that these structures are spatially separated .",
    "the effect is to be distinguished from the emergence of _ mounds _ due to the ehrlich - schwoebel instability @xcite which also occurs in homoepitaxy .",
    "at least two distinct growth scenarios display 3d - island formation : in _ volmer - weber _ growth , the structures emerge immediately upon the substrate before the adsorbate even forms a closed layer @xcite .",
    "the situation resembles the formation of non - wetting droplets of liquid on a surface .",
    "it is often observed in systems where adsorbate and substrate are fundamentally different , an example being pb on a graphite substrate @xcite .    here , we will focus on on the so  called _ stranski - krastanov _ ( sk )",
    "growth mode , where 3d - islands are found upon a persistent pseudomorphic wetting - layer ( wl ) of adsorbate material @xcite .",
    "most prominent examples for sk ",
    "systems are ge / si and inas / gaas where , as in almost all cases discussed in the literature , the adsorbate is under compression in the wl .    in order to avoid conflicts with more detailed or more restricted definitions of sk growth in the literature",
    ", we use the term _ sk - like growth _ here .",
    "it summarizes the following sequence of events during the deposition of a few monolayers @xmath49 of material :    1 .   initial layer by layer growth of a pseudomorphic , compressed adsorbate wl .",
    "the sudden appearance of 3d - islands , marking the so - called 2d-3d- or sk - transition at a _ kinetic wl thickness",
    "_ @xmath50 .",
    "further growth of the 3d - islands , which is fed by additional deposition and by incorporation of surrounding wl atoms .",
    "the observation of separated 3d - islands of similar shapes and sizes , on top of a wl with reduced _ stationary thickness _ @xmath51 .    in order to avoid confusion , and since one might interpret our ( 1 + 1)-dim .",
    "model as a cross section of the full ( 2 + 1)-dim .",
    "picture , we will use the term 2d-3d - transition as usual throughout the following .    in sk growth",
    "a number of effects might play important roles , including the mixing interdiffusion of materials or the segregation of compound adsorbates .",
    "these effects are certainly highly relevant in many cases , see several contributions in @xcite and @xcite . however , sk  like growth is observed in a variety of material systems which may or may not display these specific features .",
    "for instance , intermixing or segregation should be irrelevant in the somewhat _",
    "exotic _ case of large organic molecules like ptcda deposited on a metal substrate .",
    "nevertheless , this system shows sk  like growth according to the above definition @xcite .",
    "this very diversity of sk ",
    "systems gives rise to the hope that this growth scenario might be explained in terms of a few basic mechanisms .",
    "accordingly , it should be possible to capture and identify these universal features in relatively simple model systems without aiming at the reproduction of material specific details .",
    "this hope motivated the investigation of sk - growth in the frame of our off - lattice model .",
    "an important modification beyond the description in section [ model ] concerns the interlayer diffusion of adatoms . as argued above",
    ", the ehrlich - schwoebel effect would be much less pronounced in the physical @xmath26-dim .  situation . in our investigation of the sk - like scenario we remove the es - barrier for all interlayer diffusion events at terrace edges _ by hand_. one motivation",
    "is the above mentioned over - estimation .",
    "more importantly , we wish to investigate strain induced island formation without interference of the es instability .",
    "note that the latter leads to the formation of mounds even in homoepitaxy @xcite .    in order to favor the emergence of a wetting layer",
    ", we set @xmath52 in our model .",
    "as an example we have used @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 accordingly . if not otherwise specified , we consider a positive misfit of @xmath56 in the following .",
    "we have demonstrated before @xcite , cf .",
    "section [ dislocations ] , that strain relaxation through dislocations is not expected for @xmath57 within the first few adsorbate layers .",
    "indeed , no misfit dislocations were observed in the simulations presented here .    in the simulation",
    "we realize a situation very similar to many experiments : a fixed amount of adsorbate material , corresponding to @xmath58 , is deposited at a constant rate @xmath17 . after deposition ends , we allow for a short relaxation period , in which atoms can still diffuse on the surface .",

    "several properties of surface diffusion in our model are discussed in @xcite in greater detail .",
    "here , we shortly summarize the essential features :    * adsorbate diffusion right on the substrate is relatively slow , due to the fact that @xmath66 is quite large and satisfies @xmath67 .",
    "* adsorbate diffusion on a strained wl is relatively fast .",
    "the diffusion barrier decreases with the thickness , but essentially saturates at 3 or @xmath58 in our model , where the interaction with the substrate becomes negligible . *",
    "an adsorbate particle on top of an existing island is subject to a strong diffusion bias towards the island center .",
    "this result was already reported in @xcite .",
    "the bias is due to the partial relaxation in the island and unrelated to the ehrlich - schwoebel effect , which has been eliminated in our model .    the first two effects , ( a ) and ( b ) , clearly favor and stabilize the existence of a wetting layer .",
    "qualitatively the same relation is obtained in experimental investigations of the ge / si system @xcite and @xcite . with the model parameters specified above we find an activation barrier of approximately @xmath68 for directly on the substrate and roughly @xmath69 for diffusion on the first wetting layer .",
    "on the contrary , the diffusion bias ( c ) stabilizes existing islands by essentially confining adatoms to their top terraces .",
    "of course this is the case for particles deposited onto the island .",
    "more importantly , we find a significant contribution of particles that jump upward , from the wl atop an island .",
    "the rate for such processes is quite small , generally , but becomes significant close to the sk - transition , see @xcite for details .    in simulations with different deposition rates we observe that the kinetic wl thickness increases with @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "if the formation of second or third layer nuclei by freshly deposited particles was the driving force , one would expect more frequent nucleation and an earlier 2d-3d - transition at higher growth rates .",
    "we conclude that , in the main , upward jumps trigger the sk - transition .",
    "further evidence and a more detailed discussion of this important point is given in @xcite .",
    "our investigations suggest the following picture of the stranski - krastanov transition : the diffusion properties , ( a ) and ( b ) , favor the formation of a wetting layer and stabilize it .",
    "as the film grows , strain accumulates in the film and upward hops from the wl become more probable .",
    "the precise spatial modulation of @xmath17 in the film presumably determines the final island sizes and will be studied in forthcoming investigations .",
    "once multilayer islands have emerged they are stabilized by the diffusion bias ( c ) .",
    "after the 2d-3d - transition , islands grow by incorporating newly deposited material , but also by consumption of the surrounding wl .",

    "the migration of wl particles towards and onto the islands can well extend into the relaxation period after deposition ends .",
    "eventually , a stationary wl thickness @xmath70 is observed in our example scenario with @xmath71 . by increasing the strength of the adsorbate / substrate interaction",
    "we can achieve , e.g. , @xmath72 for @xmath73 , but it is difficult to stabilize a greater stationary thickness .",
    "this effect is related to the effective short range nature of the lj - potential , which is very weak for distances larger than @xmath74 . with , e.g. , long - range or multi - particle interactions , the model should yield greater wl thicknesses .",
    "finally , we discuss some properties of the emerging islands or sk - dots .",
    "figure [ saturate ] displays the average lateral size , measured as the number of particles in the island bottom layer .",
    "the results shown here were obtained at the end of a short relaxation period with @xmath75 . whereas the mean values do not change significantly ,",
    "fluctuations are observed to decrease in this phase .",
    "average base size @xmath76 of multilayer islands as a function of @xmath17 at @xmath77 and @xmath61 , together with standard error bars .",
    "results were obtained on average over 15 independent simulation runs .",
    "the inset shows the result for @xmath78 and different misfit parameters , the solid line corresponds to @xmath79 . ]",
    "we observe for two different temperatures that the island size decreases with increasing deposition rate .",
    "this is in accordance with several experimental observations @xcite .",
    "however , the size becomes constant and independent of @xmath80 for large enough deposition flux .",
    "a corresponding behavior is found for the island density and their lateral spacing , which hints at a considerable degree of spatial ordering @xcite .",
    "this saturation behavior further demonstrates the relevance of upward hops .",
    "standard arguments @xcite show that a dominant aggregation of deposited particles on top terraces would yield an island density that continues to increase with @xmath17 .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ saturate ] displays the mean island size for @xmath61 and @xmath81 , i.e. in the saturation regime .",
    "our result is consistent with a simple power law of the form @xmath82 . very far from equilibrium ,",
    "the only relevant length scale in the system appears to be , again , the relative periodicity @xmath39 of adsorbate and substrate lattice .",
    "despite its conceptual simplicity and the small number of parameters , our model reproduces several features of heteroepitaxial growth .",
    "strain effects are incorporated in a natural fashion as they emerge directly from the interaction of particles .",
    "for instance , we have demonstrated that misfit dislocations appear in the system when the film thickness exceeds a characteristic value . this characteristic height displays a power law behavior on the lattice misfit .",
    "we furthermore believe that , with appropriately chosen interaction parameters , our model is capable of reproducing the three essential growth modes : extended layer by layer growth ( for very small misfits ) , volmer - weber for @xmath83 and , as demonstrated already , sk - growth for @xmath84 .",
    "the small number of parameters should allow for determining the corresponding _ phase diagram _ of growth modes in the frame of our model system .    besides the exploration of the available parameter space , we intend to extend the model conceptually in several directions .",
    "as just one example , intermixing and seggregation should be included to study the relevance of these effects in the quantum dot formation .    in order to test the potential universality of our findings",
    ", we will introduce different types of interactions in our model .",
    "preliminary results for , e.g .",
    ", morse potentials @xcite and modifications of lj - potentials confirm our results in the context of dislocation formation .",
    "ultimately , we will extend our model to the physical case of growth in @xmath26 dimensions and to realistic empirical potentials for metals or semi - conductors . as a first step",
    ", we are currently investigating the sub - monolayer regime in strained heteroepitaxy of fcc materials .    in a sense ,",
    "the off - lattice kmc method provides a link between traditional , lattice based methods and molecular dynamics .",
    "hence , it might play a significant role in the further development of the multiscale approach .",
