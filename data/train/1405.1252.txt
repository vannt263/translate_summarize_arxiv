    "if we do not restrict our attention to systems , all of whose equations have the same newton polytope , then the classification of solvable systems becomes less straightforward : there do exist solvable systems of general equations with more than 4 solutions . in this generality , we only conjecture the answer ( conjecture [ conj1 ] ) and prove it in some special cases ( theorems [ thm_dimension_two ] , [ mix1 ] , and [ mix2 ] ; in the latter case , we can even prove that the system with @xmath5 solutions can not be solved by a formula involving quadratures , single - valued functions and solutions of algebraic equations of degree smaller than @xmath5 ) .",
