    "superfluid @xmath0he - b at ultra - low temperatures is an appealing target material for bolometric particle detection @xcite , with complimentary features to the currently most performing germanium- and silicon - based detectors like edelweiss @xcite and cdms @xcite . among",
    "the attractive features of @xmath0he are the clear signature of neutron background events due to the nuclear capture reaction of neutrons in @xmath0he .",
    "furthermore , the huge density of unpaired neutrons leads to a significantly enhanced axial interaction cross - section within a large class of wimp models @xcite . its single thermal energy reservoir with the possibility of direct thermometry , the very low experimental base temperature of about 100 @xmath1k , together with the possibility of electron recoil rejection make @xmath0he a very promising target material for dark matter search .",
    "the nuclear neutron capture reaction @xmath2 releases 764 kev kinetic energy to its products , and was detected bolometrically in the superfluid @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the detected neutron peak to bolometric calibrations of the detector was then used @xcite as a test of topological defect creation scenarios in fast second order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "a bolometric calibration method of the detector was first described in @xcite . in the following years",
    ", the detection threshold of the bolometer could be lowered , which allowed the identification of a broad peak at about 60 kev , that could be attributed to cosmic muons , in agreement with numerical predictions . in very recent measurements on a dark matter detector prototype ,",
    "the detection threshold reached the kev level and the low energy electron emission spectrum from a @xmath3co source could be resolved @xcite . since a neutralino interaction with a @xmath0he nucleus in the detector",
    "is expected to deposit a maximum energy of about 5.6 kev , the current detector design therefore already displays the required bolometric sensitivity .",
    "the recent improvement of the sensitivity was partly made possible by lowering the working temperature of the detector cells from about 150 to 130 @xmath1k .",
    "this temperature decrease of less than 20% represents a decrease in the thermal enthalpy of the cells by an order of magnitude . on the other hand , at lower temperature the weaker coupling of the vwr to the superfluid results nevertheless in a greater response time of the thermometer .",
    "parallely , the non - linear velocity dependence of the friction with the superfluid @xcite , is also of greater importance at the lower temperatures and the higher vwr - response signals currently used .",
    "this article hence proposes a generalization of the methods described in @xcite for a more profound and comprehensive understanding of the bolometric detector ( sections 2 to 4 ) and its calibration by mechanical heater pulses ( section 5 ) .",
    "the comparison of the bolometric calibration with detection spectra from known energy sources like neutrons ( section 6 ) as well as low energy electrons and muons ( section 7 ) allows then a precise estimation of the ultra - violet ( uv ) scintillation rate of helium for several types of ionizing radiation .",
    "the current  particle detector @xcite consists of@xcite three adjacent cylindrical copper cells , of volume @xmath4 0.13 cm@xmath0 each , immersed inside a superfluid  bath at ultra - low temperature , at about 130 @xmath1k .",
    "a 200@xmath1 m diameter orifice in the wall of the cells connects the @xmath0he inside the cell with the surrounding heat reservoir of superfluid .",
    "an energy deposition by an incident particle creates a cloud of quasiparticles in the cell , which comes to internal thermal equilibrium via collisions on the cell walls within @xmath6 1 ms .",
    "the excess ballistic quasiparticles , of momentum @xmath7 , then leak out of the cell with a time constant @xmath8 of a few seconds , which is determined mainly by the size of the orifice .",
    "he bath through the orifice .",
    "the presence of three adjacent cells allows discrimination through coincident detection .",
    "one of the cells contains the @xmath3co source ( section 7 ) , another one contains an extra vwr for the purpose of bolometric calibration by heater pulses ( section 5 ) . ]",
    "the vibrating wire resonators ( vwrs ) used for thermometry are thin ( 4.5 @xmath1 m diameter in our setup ) superconducting nbti filaments bent into an approximately semi - circular shape of a few mm , with both ends firmly fixed @xcite .",
    "the vwr is driven by a laplace force imposed by an ac current close to its mechanical resonance frequency ( @xmath9500 hz ) , and oscillates perpendicularly to its main plane with an @xmath10 velocity @xmath11 .",
    "the motion is damped by frictional forces , of total amplitude @xmath12 , mainly due to momentum transfer to the quasiparticles of the surrounding superfluid .",
    "relatively fast thermometry is then achieved by measuring continuously the damping coefficient @xmath13 of a vwr driven at resonance . in the low oscillation velocity limit",
    ", the friction is of a viscous type @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is thus velocity independent and can be written as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the superfluid gap at zero temperature .",
    "the value of the prefactor @xmath18 is determined by both the microscopic properties of the liquid and the geometry of the vwr . at 0 bar and for the vwrs used in the detector , of density @xmath19 g / cm@xmath0 and radius @xmath20 m , @xmath18 is of the order of 1 - 2 10@xmath21 hz , depending on the exact geometrical features . in quasi - static conditions ,",
    "the low velocity damping coefficient @xmath22 is measured as the full width at half - height @xmath23 of the mechanical oscillator s lorentzian resonance in frequency space .    at finite oscillation velocities however , effects beyond the two - fluid model discovered in lancaster , lead to a velocity dependent friction which is actually decreasing at higher velocities ( fig .",

    "_ @xcite leads to a velocity dependent damping @xmath24 where the function @xmath25 gives a very good approximation of the reduction of the damping of the vwr for @xmath11 up to a characteristic oscillation velocity @xmath26 1 - 2 mm / s .    at higher velocities , of about 3 - 4",

    "[ fig : i - v ] ) .",
    "while the lancaster - type non - linear coupling to the superfluid can easily be accounted for by using equation ( [ eq : non - lin - damping ] ) , the velocity has thus still to be kept small enough for both the locally turbulent and the pair - breaking regime to be avoided .    )",

    "since both the enthalpy and @xmath22 are roughly proportional to the quasiparticle density , the bolometric calibration factor @xmath50 of a given cell , defined as the conversion factor relating the amplitude @xmath39 ( @xmath51 ) of the rise in @xmath22 in ( [ eq : event ] ) to the heat @xmath52 released @xmath53 is a slow function of temperature . around 130 @xmath1k , the temperature dependence of the specific heat of @xmath0he - b",

    "at ultra - low temperatures , simulation of heating events by joule heating is inefficient in superfluid @xmath0he because of the diverging thermal ( kapitza ) resistance at the solid - liquid boundaries .",
    "@xcite proposed a heating method of the superfluid , based on the mechanical friction of the oscillating vwr with the liquid .",
    "energy is injected through a second vwr present ( the `` heater '' vwr , as in the lowest of the 3 cells in fig .",
    "[ fig:3cell ] ) , by driving it over a short time with an excitation current at its resonance frequency . the energy",
    "is then dissipated to the superfluid via the velocity dependent frictional coupling .",
    "one should bare in mind that the electrically injected power is firstly transformed into mechanical energy of the resonator before being transfered to the liquid by friction .",
    "therefore , even for a short excitation pulse of the heater ( @xmath67 ms ) , the heat release to the liquid nevertheless takes place on a characteristic timescale given by ( [ eq : delay ] ) , where the damping @xmath15 is relative to the heater wire .",
    "the energy deposition by a heater pulse is hence not instantaneous , even in the case of extremely short pulses .",
    "we have estimated quantitatively this heat release , in order to verify wether a mechanical heater pulse is indeed an acceptable simulation of a real - instantaneous - event .",
    "if one assumes velocity independent damping of the heater resonator , its amplitude of oscillation must increase linearly during the pulse and then relax exponentially with timescale @xmath68 .",
    "we have modeled numerically under these assumptions the heat release to the superfluid in such a heater pulse , as well as the response of the thermometer wire in the bolometric cell .",
    "one result and its comparison to the response calculated for an instantaneous energy release as say by an incident particle , are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : simu ] .",
    "one can see that even though the shape of the thermometer s response is quite different , especially during the rise of the response , the maximum amplitude is still the same within less than 1 % for @xmath69hz .",
    "a fit of the response by ( [ eq : peak ] ) is therefore not appropriate in the case of mechanical heater pulses , while the geometrical maximum height @xmath65 of the response peak is still a good parameter for comparing pulses to instantaneous events .",
    "s ( dotted line ) and to a mechanical heater pulse of same total energy but releasing the heat slowly ( continuous line ) because of @xmath70 . while the response to the instantaneous event is well described by ( [ eq : peak ] ) , the response to the slow heat release has a different shape during the rise , but is then rather identical exept for a time shift due to the slower release of the energy by the heater .",
    "the height @xmath65 of the two peaks is nevertheless identical within 1 % at 0.3 hz ( 128 @xmath1k ) and much less at higher temperatures . ]",
    "a more serious issue for the bolometric calibration by mechanical heater pulses are the intrinsic losses within the heater wire .",
    "the intrinsic damping ( i.e. in the absence of liquid ) of a vwr can be well modelled by a viscous friction term which therefore simply adds as a constant extra term @xmath71 to the measured damping @xmath15 in ( [ damping ] ) . in our experiment , we measure the heater vwr intrinsic width as the limiting value of the damping in the low temperature limit , to be @xmath72 mhz . as the thermal quasiparticle damping vanishes at low temperatures , the intrinsic losses in the heater represent a fraction @xmath73 of the injected energy and constitute a non - negligible correction to the energy injection through the heater wire .",
    "let us now consider the energy and velocity dependence of the detector response . at constant oscillation velocity , the height @xmath65 of the response",
    "is experimentally observed to be linear in the injected energy in the range of a few hundred kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h / e ] ) , which confirms the assumptions leading to ( [ eq : sens_def ] ) . furthermore , a comparison of the observed slopes versus the vwr s oscillation velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slope / v ] ) are in good agreement with the enhancement of the response at higher velocities , as given by ( [ eq : non - lin - calib - function ] ) .",
    "this analysis allows therefore to extract the velocity independent limit of the calibration factor @xmath59 .",

    "taking into account intrinsic losses in the heater as well as the features of the thermometer vwr response deduced in the previous sections , one can fit the mechanical pulse calibration data versus baseline ( i.e. versus temperature ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : calib ] .",
    "if @xmath78 is left as a free parameter , the fit yields a value of @xmath79 mhz and a calibration factor of @xmath80 hz / kev at a baseline of 1 hz ( [ fig : calib ] ) .",

    "the data are then corrected by ( [ eq : hovera ] ) to account for the slowing down of the thermometer at low temperatures ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "considering the fact that a fraction @xmath83 of the injected energy is dissipated inside the heater vwr , the result can be fitted by ( [ eq : sigma0])(dashed line ) .",
    "the only free parameter is the overal prefactor of ( [ eq : sigma0 ] ) which allows then to express @xmath84 ( continuous line ) . ]",
    "the heat release to the superfluid following a nuclear neutron capture reaction @xmath0he + @xmath85h + @xmath86 was observed in @xcite to be at 0 bar about 15 % less than the 764 kev known to be released by the reaction . for a microscopic calculation of the stopping of the neutron capture products in @xmath0he",
    "see @xcite . a substantial part of the energy deficit can be attributed to ultra - violet ( uv ) scintillation @xcite .",
    "the uv fraction was estimated in @xcite to account for about half of the energy deficit , concluding that the remaining @xmath960 kev were trapped in the form of topological defects .",
    "neutrons are an extremely valuable tool for the characterization of the superfluid bolometers because they provide a narrow and cell - geometry independent peak at rather high energies .",
    "once the bolometric heat release of neutrons in @xmath0he inambiguously determined , no other calibration , e.g. by pulses , is necessary .",
    "the comparison of the evolution of the observed neutron peak with temperature also allows to test directly , without the use of mechanical heater pulses , the assumptions leading to ( [ eq : full - line ] ) .    .",
    "note that several points do not actually represent single neutron capture events , but the sites of larger concentration of events at a given @xmath33 ( circles ) correspond to the neutron peak at that temperature .",
    "the continuous line represents the temperature dependence of the expected height @xmath65 corresponding to the neutron peak as given by ( [ eq : full - line ] ) . ]",
    "the dependence of the neutron peaks position on the baseline ( i.e. on temperature ) is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrons ] .",
    "the agreement of the baseline dependence as given by ( [ eq : full - line ] ) is good except for the very lowest temperatures where an absolute deviation from ( [ eq : full - line ] ) of about 6% is observed at @xmath33=100 mhz .",
    "the analysis yields a bolometric heat deposition of 652@xmath8720 kev at 0 bar , in very good agreement with earlier measurements , where 650 kev were found under the same conditions @xcite .",
    "wether the observed energy deficit of about 110 kev can be significantly accounted for by topological defects is nevertheless still an open question .",
    "an extensive study of the pressure dependence of this deficit is in progress and might give some new insight on this question @xcite .",
    "the detection of electrons of 7 and 14 kev emitted by a @xmath3co source within one superfluid @xmath0he - b bolometer has been reported recently @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the detected electron spectrum with the bolometric calibration factor of that cell , determined as described in sections 2 - 5 , yields a deficit of 25@xmath88% in the bolometrically detected energy .",
    "we therefore define the scintillation yield in the following as the fraction of the injected energy that is released as radiation .    in helium ,",
    "the distance between two consecutive collisions of electrons in the kev range is a fraction of a @xmath1 m .",
    "this distance is much larger than that in the case of @xmath18-particles or the neutron capture products . upon electron irradiation ,",
    "the energy is hence deposited with much lower density and at no time the density of heat is such that the superfluid could heat up to the normal state . in the case of electrons ,",
    "the energy deficit is therefore entirely due to uv scintillation .",
    "the scintillation yield is very sensitive to the density of the energy deposition .",
    "our results can be compared to measurements by adams _",
    "@xcite who find a 35% uv scintillation yield in @xmath89he upon irradiation by electrons of a few hundred kev . nevertheless , as later emphasized by mckinsey _",
    "@xcite , this measurement only covered the fast emission pulse of the first 10 - 20nanoseconds . a substantial part of the uv emission , estimated to @xmath650% of the fast pulse contribution by these authors ,",
    "takes place at much later times , which brings the uv scintillation yield to a total of about 50% for high energy electrons . at lower energies on the kev level",
    ", this fraction is expected to decrease rapidly .",
    "our findings of the scintillation rate at @xmath610kev represent thus a very reasonable low energy extension of the measurements by mckinsey _",
    "_    the muon events also display in our detector a clearly resolved spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig : muons ] shows data taken from @xcite , comparing numerical simulations to measurements taken within the mache3 collaboration on the muon peak . a geant 4.0 code computer simulation of the muon energy release in our @xmath0he cell , integrated over a large spectrum of incident muon energies , leads to a broad peak at about 67 kev .",
    "the dispersion of the energy distribution is a result of the muons tracks crossing the cell geometry in all space directions with the known angular dependence of radiation intensity @xcite .",
    "the muon energy release to the target material is rather independent on the energy of the incident muons in the range from 1 to 10 gev covering the maximum of the energy distribution of muons at ground level .",
    "the width of the experimentally detected muon spectrum corresponds to the intrinsic resolution of our detector ( 3 % ) combined to the geometrical broadening .",
    "the muons produce exclusively electron recoils in the cell producing delta rays , i.e. electrons scattered from the atomic shells , energy - distributed following @xmath90 . for one incident muon ,",
    "roughly 10 of such electrons have an energy greater than 250 ev and only 5 greater than 1 kev .",
    "in our experiment we have collected data in the muon energy range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : muons ] ) during 19 hours .",
    "a broad maximum of events with an average energy of 52 kev is clearly seen .",
    "the comparison between the bolometric measurement and the simulation of the energy input by muons therfore yields again an energy deficit of about 25 % .",
    "the missing energy being the result of the scintillation of uv photons as for incident electrons , this observed deficit again allows to quantify the scintillation rate of helium for this type of irradiation .",
    ".measured energy release by different particles and their scintillation rates [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]",
    "we have presented a detailed description of the method of bolometric calibration of the detector cells based on superfluid @xmath0he , by mechanical pulses .",
    "this description provides a general and comprehensive picture of the bolometer under different conditions of use ( excitation level , temperature ) .",
    "the results of the calibration are compared to measured heat depositions by the nuclear neutron capture reactions as well as muon impacts and low energy electron irradiation .",
    "a deficit of about 15% is found in the case of neutrons , in good agreement with previous measurements at 0 bar @xcite , in which case this deficit is partly associated to vortex creation . in the case of high energy muons , as well as electrons in the 10kev range ,",
    "a deficit of about 25% is found which can be entirely attributed to uv scintillation emission .",
    "it is not surprising to find the scintillation rates resulting from these two types of irradiation to be of the same order since the much larger incident energy of cosmic muons is compensated by their larger mass .",
    "now that our detector has achieved the required sentitivity for resolving recoils in the kev energy range , we focused on the the feasibility of a electron recoil rejection by parallel scintillation detection . since we found the uv scintillation yield not to be small for both electrons and muons down to the energy range of interest , this result gives experimental evidence that the parallel use of a scintillation detector would allow to reject efficiently electron- , muon- and most likely @xmath91-contamination in a bolometric detector based on superfluid @xmath0he for the search of non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "the optimum design of such a parallel scintillation detector will be discussed in a future work .",
