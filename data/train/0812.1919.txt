    "time dependent spatially localized solutions in various field theories , which are long living in the sense of staying localized much longer than the light crossing time , have been already found in the seventies @xcite and ever since they are still attracting considerable interest @xcite .",
    "an obvious reason for interest is the unexpected longevity of these objects , all of which exhibit nearly periodic oscillations in time .",
    "the presence of at least one real massive scalar field seems to be necessary in order that such long living , spatially localized field oscillations  _ oscillons _  could form .",
    "since oscillons appear in the course of time evolution starting from rather generic initial data , this provides another reason to consider them of physical importance .",
    "oscillons have been found to form in physical processes , e.g.  as a result of vortex - antivortex annihilation in two dimensional abelian higgs model @xcite , domain wall collapse in @xmath0 theory @xcite , qcd phase transition @xcite , or during symmetry breaking in three dimensional abelian higgs model @xcite .",
    "therefore there is some reason to believe that oscillons ( or configurations close to them ) influence the dynamics , and they play a rle in phase transitions , cosmology and the dynamics of extended objects ( cosmic strings , domain walls , etc . ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "importantly oscillons have been also found in the bosonic sector of the standard model @xcite .",
    "there are attempts for including fermion fields in the study of oscillons @xcite .",
    "oscillons resemble breathers of the one dimensional sine - gordon ( sg ) theory , with the important difference that unlike true breathers they are continuously loosing energy by slow radiation .",
    "an oscillon just like a breather possesses a localized `` core '' , but differs significantly in its `` radiative '' region outside of the core .",
    "oscillons have been observed in various spatial dimensions , from @xmath1 up to @xmath2 @xcite , there is , however , a marked difference between oscillons in @xmath3 and in @xmath4 . in dimensions",
    "@xmath1,@xmath5 oscillons can be well described by an adiabatic time evolution of breather - like configurations with an ever decreasing amplitude and with an increasing frequency tending towards a limit determined by the mass threshold @xcite . in higher dimensions there are various types of oscillons , they exhibit instabilities and their behaviour is more complex @xcite .",
    "oscillons have been studied on a @xmath6 dimensional expanding background in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider oscillons in scalar field theories with a general self - interaction potential in one spatial dimension .",
    "so far most work on oscillons has been either purely numerical or based on various approximations .",
    "e.g. oscillon energy and lifetime has been recently estimated in ref .",
    "our starting point is the small amplitude expansion @xcite which yields breather - like configurations with spatially localized cores .",
    "the small amplitude expansion yields an asymptotic series for the core .",
    "solutions of the field equations are either periodic in time or are radiating . in the first case standing wave tails",
    "are present outside of the breather core , whereas in the radiative case there are outgoing waves .",
    "these latter correspond to oscillons .",
    "following segur and kruskal @xcite and adapting the approach developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite we compute analytically one of the most important physical characteristics of oscillons , the amplitude of the outgoing wave responsible for their eventual demise .",
    "although strictly speaking our results are only valid for small amplitude oscillons , this is not a major drawback , since in @xmath1 the long time behaviour of any oscillon ( which is what we are interested in ) is determined by that of the small amplitude one .",
    "the energy loss of a small amplitude oscillon in @xmath1 to leading order can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy of the oscillon core , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constants determined by the theory .",
    "the corresponding equation for the @xmath0 theory has been found first in ref .",
    "geicke @xcite has verified numerically the asymptotic energy loss following from eq .",
    ", i.e.  @xmath11 .",
    "since this is not a completely straightforward numerical exercise ( one has to prepare very good initial data , one needs long time simulations to high precision , etc . )",
    "we have also made a detailed numerical investigation .",
    "for small enough amplitudes , @xmath12 , one has @xmath13 and it is clear that the energy loss is beyond all orders in @xmath12 . in this work",
    "we compute the constants @xmath9 , @xmath10 analytically , using matched asymptotic expansion and borel summation techniques , as well as by an independent numerical method .",
    "also we have been able to give convincing numerical evidence for the validity of the radiation law by preparing good initial data and performing long time simulations .",
    "we have also checked the validity of our analytical and numerical results on the example of the sine - gordon theory where @xmath9 is exactly zero .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following : first , in subsection [ sec : small ] we present the essential points of the small amplitude expansion in a one dimensional scalar field theory and relate it to the fourier expansion of time - periodic solutions .",
    "then we analytically extend the solution of the mode equations to the complex plane . in subsection",

    "[ sec : phi4 ] we investigate @xmath0 oscillons evolving from initial data extracted from the small amplitude expansion .",
    "we found that the functional form of the theoretical radiation law , eq . fits our data points ; however , the fitted value of @xmath9 differs from the theoretical one .",
    "one reason for the disagreement is the exceptionally small value of @xmath9 in the @xmath0 theory .",
    "furthermore we have performed simulations starting with the initial data of ref .",

    "[ sec : verification ] we investigate oscillon radiation in a specific @xmath14 theory where the value @xmath9 is maximal . in this case",

    "the equation of motion is just a non - linear wave equation ( nlwe ) given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a real scalar field . in eq .",

    "@xcite small amplitude solutions of eq . can be represented by the series : @xmath20 where @xmath12 is a small parameter and the coordinates have been rescaled as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with @xmath23 .",
    "the time dependence of the functions @xmath24 is found to be determined recursively by a set of ( forced ) oscillator equations .",
    "for example the first few @xmath25 can be written as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are given in terms of the parameters of the potential and of a single function , @xmath29 as : @xmath30\\ , , \\label{e : p3}\\ ] ] together with @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the function @xmath29 is a globally regular solution of the following nonlinear equation : @xmath33 by fixing the center of symmetry at @xmath34 the regular solution of eq .",
    "is given simply by @xmath35 the only condition on the potential ensuring the existence of an exponentially decreasing solution to eq .",
    "is the positivity of the parameter @xmath36 .",
    "it is clear that each term in the series eq .",
    "is exponentially decaying in space and is periodic in time , hence if it would converge it would yield exponentially localized breathers .",
    "it has been demonstrated by segur and kruskal @xcite for the example of the @xmath0 theory with @xmath37/8 , that the small amplitude expansion does not converge , actually it is an asymptotic series .",
    "nevertheless for sufficiently small values of @xmath12 this asymptotic series constitutes an excellent approximation for oscillons of frequency @xmath38 over a large interval in @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for the absence of spatially localized , exactly time - periodic breathers is simply that for generic potentials , time - dependent solutions of the nlwe radiate .",
    "this makes it very plausible that the asymptoticity of the series in general models is due to radiative phenomena .",
    "an interesting prototype exception , i.e. when converges , is the celebrated breather solution of the sine - gordon ( sg ) theory , where @xmath40 . the sg breather can be written as @xmath41= 4\\arctan\\left [ \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\sqrt{1-\\varepsilon^2}}\\frac{s(\\zeta)\\sin\\tau}{\\sqrt2}\\right]\\,.\\ ] ] it is a simple matter now to show that the small amplitude expansion of the sg breather yields a convergent series , indeed .",
    "let us note here that in eq .",

    "the series is unique .",
    "since all of its terms are time - periodic , it represents a family of breather - like solutions in the sense of an asymptotic series . at this point",

    "the asymptotic tail can be approximated as consisting of a superposition of standing waves of frequencies @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "we note that for bounded solutions all modes @xmath56 for @xmath57 contain two parameters which can be interpreted as an amplitude and a phase of the corresponding frequency standing wave .",
    "we are interested in solutions for which the amplitudes of the tails are much smaller than that of the core , and these are the ones related to oscillons .",
    "because of the existence of the asymptotic standing wave tail these solutions are not unique .",
    "intuitively it is clear that for a given frequency , solutions with the smallest possible amplitude standing wave tail should be close to the `` inner part '' of oscillons . it is quite plausible that for a fixed value of @xmath12 , the solution with a minimal amplitude tail and being symmetric with respect to the origin , is actually unique .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the results of ref .",

    "another type of quasi - breather is the ( most likely unique ) solution , for which all modes , @xmath58 exponentially for say @xmath59 , with a small amplitude oscillating tail in the other direction .",
    "we shall refer to such objects as asymmetric quasi - breathers .    for sufficiently small values of @xmath12",
    "the tail amplitudes become exponentially small in @xmath12 . in this case",
    "the core can be treated separately from the tail , and a linear superposition of the two is a very good approximation to the solution .",
    "one can verify that the small amplitude expansion of reproduces the terms of the asymptotic expansion .",
    "we remark that the small amplitude expansion represents an essentially unique core .",
    "as already mentioned the amplitude of the standing wave tail is @xmath60 , i.e. it is beyond all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "segur and kruskal ( sk ) @xcite has worked out a method to compute this `` transcendentally small '' amplitude on the example of the @xmath0 theory using matched asymptotic series expansion . in the following",
    "we shall use the sk method to find the amplitude of the standing wave tail of quasi - breathers when @xmath61 .",
    "the main idea of the sk method is to define an `` inner '' problem in the complex @xmath39-plane in the neighborhood of the singularity of @xmath62 closest to the real axis .",
    "clearly it is located at @xmath63 where the function @xmath62 has a simple pole .",

    "for example , for symmetric potentials the inner equations are : @xmath68 \\phi_n = \\frac{g_3}{4}\\,\\sum_{m , p , q=1}^{+\\infty}\\phi_m\\phi_p\\phi_q\\,\\delta_{n,\\,\\pm m \\pm p\\pm q}+\\ldots \\label{e : compmod2}\\ ] ] where it has been also used that @xmath69 to leading order in @xmath12 .",
    "we look for such solutions of the mode equations of the inner problem which can be matched to the solution of the outer problem . in our case",
    "the outer problem is defined by the analytic continuation of the small amplitude expansion from the real axis .",
    "the matching region is parametrized in the following way : @xmath70 making use of the fact that the leading @xmath12 order of @xmath56 on the real axis is proportional to @xmath71 it follows that in the matching region @xmath72 where the coefficients @xmath73 are uniquely determined by the small amplitude expansion on the real axis .",
    "the first few terms in the expansion , up to order @xmath74 , can be written as @xmath75      in this subsection we will construct an exponential correction to the asymptotic series , eq . which after matching to the outer region determines the amplitude of the standing wave tail . a correction beyond all orders to a divergent series might seem meaningless at first glance , however , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we can give meaning to the method by finding a place where at least the imaginary part of the original series converges .",
    "this region is the imaginary axis @xmath76 , where the algebraic asymptotic series is real , so @xmath77 and the imaginary part of the series converges trivially .",
    "we divide @xmath56 into real and imaginary parts , @xmath78 and decompose the inner version of eq .",
    "( with @xmath79 and using the variable @xmath66 ) into real and imaginary parts .",
    "then one can linearize the imaginary parts of the mode equations , and obtain coupled linear differential equations for @xmath80 along the imaginary axis .",
    "these equations contain @xmath81 terms multiplied by various powers of @xmath82 . as a first approximation , in the matching region",

    "it is possible to get correction terms to @xmath88 by taking into account terms proportional to @xmath82 in the differential equations and substituting them by the leading order terms of the asymptotic expansion . also considering the coupling between different @xmath80 , we get @xmath91 + \\mathcal{o}\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\,\\exp\\left(-i\\sqrt{8}\\ , y\\right)\\right)\\ , .",

    "we should still match the correction to the imaginary part , eq .",

    "we analytically continue @xmath99 to the complex plane .",
    "we match it to the exponential correction obtained in the inner region around the pole @xmath100 , and to the corresponding expression around @xmath101 .",
    "this determines @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath102 neglecting contributions from higher fourier modes the derivative of the field @xmath17 in the origin oscillates as @xmath103 for symmetric potentials the above matching procedure works in a completely analogous way .",
    "the original problem of determining a periodic solution of the field equation , eq . is well posed if we impose boundary conditions .",
    "we use the boundary conditions introduced by segur and kruskal in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely we require the field to vanish at @xmath104 and that the solution remains bounded .",
    "these requirements provide sufficient conditions to make the solution unique .",
    "we obtained a time - periodic solution of the field equation which is asymmetric with respect to @xmath105 .",
    "it is clearly not a breather , since it has a standing wave tail in @xmath106 and in this sense it is weakly localized .",
    "we can add a transcendentally small standing wave to @xmath95 as it solves the corresponding linearized mode equation about the asymmetric quasi - breather ( aqb ) denoted by @xmath107 and it will give the leading order transcendental term in the new solution .",
    "therefore one can write a symmetric configuration @xmath108 in the following form : @xmath109 where @xmath110 denotes a transcendentally small standing wave .",
    "@xmath110 has to make @xmath111 symmetric about the origin .",
    "this requirement is enough to uniquely determine it .",
    "the derivative of @xmath107 at @xmath105 is given by , hence @xmath112 where @xmath113 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the symmetric configuration with the minimal amplitude tail , corresponding to @xmath114 , has been named quasi - breather in ref .",
    "this result is consistent with our knowledge about symmetric solutions , as when we take into account the standing wave tail in one mode , one of the two free parameters is required for symmetrization . from eq .",
    "one immediately gets the standing wave tail of the asymmetric quasi - breather : @xmath115 in conclusion we were able to determine the asymptotic field of the asymmetric and symmetric quasi - breathers up to one parameter @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) . in subsections [ ss : comp ] and [ ss : bs ] we will determine this parameter .",
    "we can construct a symmetric time dependent solution of the field equation by repeating the same steps as in the time periodic case and replacing the standing wave @xmath110 with a moving wave @xmath118 .",
    "let us denote the oscillon field with @xmath119 .",
    "then from @xmath120 it follows that @xmath121 we find that the amplitude of the tail of the quasi - breather determined by @xmath114 is equal to the amplitude of the outgoing radiation from the corresponding oscillon .",
    "this property has been already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite .    after the little digression on quasi - breather tails and the determination of the oscillon radiation field we focus on the radiation law .",
    "the asymptotic oscillon field from eq . is : @xmath122 where @xmath123 for asymmetric potentials and @xmath124 for symmetric potentials .",
    "the energy carried away by these oscillating tails determines the time - averaged radiation power @xmath125 of the oscillon : @xmath126 since the radiation field is transcendentally small , it is reasonable to assume that during its time - evolution the core of the oscillon goes through undistorted quasi - breather states .",
    "this statement will be referred to as the adiabatic hypothesis .",
    "the energy content @xmath8 of the core of the quasi - breathers as a function of @xmath12 ( or equivalently as a function of its frequency @xmath127 ) is easily determined , it is given by : @xmath128 now the equation determining the change of the core energy with time ( energy loss ) for oscillons can be seen to be of the form given by eq .  .",
    "from eq .   one can easily deduce that the leading order late time behaviour of the energy is given as @xmath129 in this subsection the radiation law for small amplitude oscillons has been determined up to a single unknown parameter , @xmath9 .",

    "first , we consider the @xmath0 theory , in which case the only non - vanishing coefficients in the expansion of the potential are @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "we consider various order truncations of the fourier mode equations in the region close to the singularity . to illustrate our method we present in more details the calculations for the simplest truncated system that radiates , i.e. that for which only up to @xmath132 modes are kept . for the inner problem , in the @xmath133 limit , the mode equations are @xmath134 expanding the mode equations into powers of @xmath135 @xmath136 we find that all coefficients are fixed after choosing @xmath137 and the sign in @xmath138 .",

    "we would like to investigate the problem of oscillon radiation from the perspective of field configuration as well . in fig .",
    "[ f : radfield ] we show the field values as a function of time at @xmath179 for the @xmath180 oscillon .",
    "we plot the theoretical prediction of this oscillating tail , so that the frequency of the wave is set to @xmath181 , the amplitude is determined by theory and only the phase of the wave is fitted .",
    "we find satisfactory agreement in the case of wave amplitude and precise agreement in the case of frequency . if we compare the radiation power calculated from this plane wave and the one in table [ prec ] we find good agreement .",
    "hence we conclude that the oscillons on the lattice loose energy via radiation and that out assumptions were correct when deriving the radiation law for small amplitude oscillons .",
    "there are various possible explanations for the discrepancy between theoretical and numerical results .",
    "firstly , we could argue that the @xmath12 values used in numerical simulations are too big and the theoretical calculation of the radiation amplitude only works for infinitesimal @xmath12 values . for finite @xmath12 values we can only expect an approximate agreement .",
    "secondly , we can not be sure about the initial data .",
    "although the frequency of our objects is very stable there is no way to decide whether we work with undistorted oscillons .",
    "the configuration with anomalous radiation emphasizes these problems .",
    "lattice effects are less probable to play a role , as we see no major resolution and @xmath178 dependence of the radiation powers .",
    "oscillon in the @xmath14 theory.[f : radfield],width=453 ]    we conclude that we can accurately determine the @xmath175 parameter of the radiation law from the numerical simulation of oscillon decay in the case of both the @xmath0 and @xmath14 case .",
    "the parameter @xmath116 can be less accurately determined in the case of the @xmath0 theory .",
    "there the next to leading corrections play a role because of the finite @xmath12 oscillons and the value of @xmath116 is too small to be seen . in the case of the @xmath14 theory",
    "the next to leading order corrections are smaller and the value of @xmath117 is bigger , hence we can get the value of @xmath117 from the simulations with satisfactory precision .",
    "the investigation of the radiation field of the oscillons show equally good agreement with the theoretical formulae giving a firm basis for the theoretical calculations from another perspective .",
    "in a general class of one dimensional scalar field theories we have computed the magnitude of the radiative tail of oscillons , determining their energy loss , in the small amplitude limit .",
    "the magnitude of the tail is non - perturbatively small in the amplitude .",
