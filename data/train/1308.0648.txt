    "the gravitational interaction of a planet with a protoplanetary disk can significantly change the evolution of both the planet and disk .",
    "planets can migrate in disks through the excitation of density waves ( goldreich & tremaine 1979 , tanaka et al .",
    "2002 ) . on the other hand , the planet can open a gap in the disk if angular momentum carried by density waves can be efficiently transferred to the disk ( lin & papaloizou 1986 ) .",
    "recently , there have been two major developments in our understanding of the gap opening process .",
    "the first is the realization that low mass planets can also open gaps through nonlinear density wave steepening ( goodman & rafikov 2001 , rafikov 2002a ) .",
    "traditionally , it had been thought that the density wave needs to be highly nonlinear at the location where it is excited in order to open a gap around the planet ( lin & papaloizou 1993 ) .",
    "this translates to a criterion that , to open gaps , the planet mass needs to be above the thermal mass defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the local sound speed and scale height at the planet s position . with @xmath11 , @xmath12",
    "however , nonlinear density wave theory ( goodman & rafikov 2001 ) suggests that even if the planet mass is below the thermal mass and the density waves are linear at excitation , they gradually but efficiently steepen , ultimately turning into weak shocks not too far from the planet .",
    "dissipation of the wave angular momentum at these shocks drives gap opening even around low mass planets ( rafikov 2002b ) .",
    "this picture has been confirmed recently by high resolution simulations ( li et al .",
    "2009 , muto et al .",
    "2010 , dong et al .",
    "2011b , duffell & macfadyen 2012 , zhu et al .  2013 ) .",
    "gap opening by low mass planets can significantly slow down planet migration ( rafikov 2002b , li et al .",
    "2009 ) , which has far - reaching implications for the survivability of planets .",
    "furthermore , the fact that gaps can be induced by low mass planets also suggests that gaps can be very common in protoplanetary disks , which may explain the recent observations of protoplanetary disks with gaps and cavities .",
    "the second intriguing development is that , when the disk viscosity is low enough ( @xmath13 ) , vortices are generated at gap edges ( koller , li & lin 2003 , li et al .",
    "2005 , de val - borro et al .",
    "2007 , lin & papaloizou 2010 ) .",
    "these vortices are produced by the rossby wave instability ( rwi ) ( lovelace et al .",
    "1999 , li et al .",
    "2000 ) . at the planet - induced gap edges , spiral shocks introduce vortensity minima which lead to rwi and vortex formation .",
    "several vortices form initially , which then quickly merge into one vortex .",
    "the interaction between the planet and the vortex can ultimately affect planet migration ( li et al .",
    "2009 , yu et al .",
    "2010 , lin & papaloizou 2010 ) .",
    "the interaction between the planet and the gaseous disk has been studied systematically in many papers ( see the review by kley & nelson 2012 for references ) .",
    "however , the effect of a planet on dust particles and planetesimals in protoplanetary disks is less well studied .",
    "although the total mass of dust is only 1/100 of the gas mass , it represents the key element for building planets and can be detected much more easily since the opacity of the dust is orders of magnitude larger than that of the gas . in this paper , we explore how these two recent developments on gap opening will manifest themselves in dust particles .",
    "although a low mass planet ( e.g. 10 @xmath14 ) takes a long time to open noticeable gaps in the gas , even a very shallow gap in the gas during the gap opening process will change the drift speed of dust particles significantly ( whipple 1972 , weidenschilling 1977 ) .",
    "particles tend to accumulate at gap edges and produce a far more significant particle gap . inside this gap",
    ", the planet will accrete gas having little dust , and the metallicity of the planet may be lowered .",
    "such particle concentrations at gap edges can also facilitate planetesimal formation . coincidentally , the fastest drifting dust particles , which have the most prominent dust gaps , are in the submm - cm size range when the particle is at @xmath15 au .",
    "this provides an opportunity for submm ( e.g. alma ) and cm ( e.g. evla ) observations to probe these gaps .",
    "when a sharp gap is carved out by the planet , either slowly by a low mass planet or quickly by a massive planet , the gap edges start to develop vortices .",
    "vortices are ideal places to trap dust particles ( barge & sommeria 1995 , lyra et al .",
    "2009ab , johansen et al .  2004 ;",
    "heng & kenyon 2010 , meheut 2012 ) .",
    "the three outstanding issues are ( 1 ) can vortices survive in 3-d ?",
    "( 2 ) particles of what size can accumulate in the vortices ? and",
    "( 3 ) how are particles distributed in the vortices ? a 3-d vortex can undergo elliptical instability ( lesur & papaloizou 2009 ) .",
    "even if the vortex survive for a long period of time , it may not concentrate a large amount of dust if only particles in a narrow size range can accumulate within the vortex .",
    "if the vortex has strong vertical motions which can stir up dust particles , strong settling towards the disk midplane is unlikely , inhibiting planetesimal formation within the vortex . to answer these questions , we need to understand the dynamics and 3-d structure of the vortices .",
    "it requires evolving the particle distribution together with the gas .",
    "evolution of dust particles in protoplanetary disks needs to be calculated by directly integrating the orbits of a large number of dust particles or solving the collisionless - boltzman equation for the particle distribution function .",
    "both approaches are quite different from solving the navier - stokes equations for the gas . in some limiting cases ,",
    "the boltzman equation can be reduced to a simpler form .",
    "for example , when the particles are very small , their coupling timescale with the gas is far smaller than the orbital timescale . in this case",
    ", a simple closure can be found , reducing the boltzman equation to the zero pressure fluid equation ( garaud et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "some initial attempts using this zero - pressure fluid approach to study particle response to the planet and gap in the gas have already been made ( paardekooper & mellema 2004 , 2006 , zhu et al 2012 ) .",
    "however , these 2-d two - fluid simulations were limited to small particles .    in order to study particles of any size",
    ", we need to treat dust particles as individual particles and integrate their orbits with n - body integrators .",
    "sph codes are ideal for this task by design and they have been used to study planet s effects on dust particles ( fouchet et al .  2007 , 2010 , ayliffe et al .",
    "however , for the gas , large viscosities are normally introduced in sph codes , so that they can not be used to study gap opening by low mass planets and rwi at gap edges . in order to treat gas dynamics accurately and particle dynamics self - consistently , we need to incorporate an n - body code into a grid - based fluid code .",
    "lyra et al .",
    "( 2009a ) have developed such a hybrid scheme to simulate gap opening in global disks using 2-d cartesian grids and pointed out that particles are trapped in the vortices .",
    "however , they also noticed that rwi is not reproduced well at the gap edge when the gap is shallow .",
    "they suggest that cartesian grids need higher resolutions than the cylindrical grids to capture the formation of the gap edge vortices , and solving fluid equations and integrating particle orbits under cylindrical coordinates may be more appropriate ( also pointed out by de val - borro et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we develop and implement three particle integrators using cylindrical coordinates into magnetohydrodynamic code athena ( stone et al .",
    "the particle integrators are phase - volume conserving , time - reversible , and second - order accurate . with these newly developed particle integrators combined with the higher - order godunov hydrodynamic scheme of athena",
    ", this hybrid code can accurately simulate both hydrodynamics ( e.g. gap opening and rwi ) and particle dynamics . in this paper",
    ", we systematically explore the effects of different mass planets ( from far below the thermal mass to far above the thermal mass ) on dust particles ( with particle sizes spanning more than 6 orders of magnitude from well - coupled limits to decoupled limits ) in 2-d and 3-d protoplanetary disks .",
    "in particular , we study whether a very low mass planet can produce prominent dust gaps , whether particles still settle within the vortex at the gap edge , and particles of what size can be trapped by the vortex .    in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce the particle integrators . in section 3",
    ", we describe how we set up our simulations , together with a discussion on particle settling and drift in disks .",
    "our results are presented in section 4 .",

    "orbital advection significantly speeds up our simulations since the numerical time step is limited by the ratio between the grid size and the deviation of the gas and particle velocity to the background keplerian velocity . when the planet is present in the disk , the numerical time step is normally limited by eccentric particles which are excited by the planet . for our 2-d simulations ,",

    "these shocks can change the vortensity in two ways .",
    "first they can add vortensity to the fluid in horseshoe orbits when the flow is passing the planet , and these high vortensity gas circulates in the horseshoe region ( lin & papaloizou 2010 ) .",
    "second , the shock will push the flow away from the planet and lead to gap opening , which causes a vortensity minimum at the gap edge ( li et al .",
    "since vortensity is not conserved in 3-d disks , the above explanations can not be applied to 3-d disks .",
    "however the great similarity between the upper ( 2-d cases ) and lower ( 3-d cases ) panels of figure [ fig : fig3p2 ] suggests that , at the midplane of the 3-d disk , the disk behaves approximately two dimensionally .",
    "although the peaks of vortensity just outside the horseshoe region are prominent , rwi is not operating there .",
    "as lin & papaloizou ( 2010 ) pointed out , the gap edge ( outside the horseshoe region ) where the vortensity is at the minimum is rossby wave unstable .",
    "when the rwi first develops , it produces 3 - 4 vortices at the gap edge , which was analytically understood by linear analysis of lin & papaloizou ( 2010 ) when @xmath94 .",
    "eventually , these vortices merge into a single vortex .",

    "but there are several noticeable differences due to the 3-d structure of the disk .",
    "first , particles drift faster at the midplane of a 3-d disk than in a 2-d disk as discussed in appendix b. in figure [ fig : fig9 ] , par .",
    "c and par .",
    "d have all drifted inward of @xmath117 at 100 orbits in 3-d disks , while there are still particles beyond @xmath118 at the same time in 2-d disks as shown in figure [ fig : fig6 ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , par .",
    "c and par .",
    "d have all drifted to the central star within 300 orbits .",

    "b in the 3-d disk ( figure [ fig : fig8 ] ) is less prominent than that in the 2-d disk ( figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "this is because the torque exerted by a planet is 2.5 times stronger in 2-d disks than that in 3-d disks ( tanaka et al .",
    "thus gaps in the gas are more difficult to open in 3-d disks than in 2-d disks , and shallower gaps in 3-d disks have less effect on particle concentration .",
    "third , there is particle concentration at the planet s position in 3-d disks . by comparing figure [ fig : fig4 ] and figure",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , or comparing figure [ fig : fig6 ] and figure [ fig : fig9 ] , we can see that , for par .",
    "c and par .",
    "d , there are no particles at the planet position ( @xmath34 , @xmath119 ) in 2-d simulations , while the dust concentration ratios are quite high there in 3-d simulations .",
    "this is because , in 3-d simulations , a small smoothing length for the planetary potential leads to a centrally peaked dense core around the planet .",
    "such a core has a sharp pressure gradient towards the center and thus can effectively concentrate particles . while in 2-d simulations , in order to mimic the planet potential in 3-d , a large smoothing length which is around the planet s hill radius or the disk scale height is normally applied , leading to a smoother core around the planet , which is less efficient at trapping particles .",
    "the azimuthally averaged surface density is shown in figure [ fig : fig10 ] . by comparing with figure [ fig :",
    "fig4p1 ] and figure [ fig : fig6p1 ] , we can see that the gap depths and particle concentration are qualitatively similar between 2-d and 3-d simulations .",
    "the gas and particle surface density for the m50d3 case in the x - y plane is shown in figure [ fig : fig11 ] .",
    "we can see that the vortex is highly elongated along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "two outstanding questions regarding particle concentration in the vortex are 1 ) does the vortex have strong vertical motions which can stir up the particles , inhibiting settling and concentration within the vortex ? 2 ) particles of what size can be trapped in the vortex ? if particles with quite different sizes can all be trapped within the vortex , the total dust mass inside the vortex can be high and planetesimal formation may be much easier .    1.32 ) at the gap edge along the @xmath4 direction for the 2-d ( m50d2 , the left panel ) and 3-d simulation ( m50d3 , the right panel ) .",
    "the surface density shown is derived by averaging the disk surface density from r=1.27 to r=1.37 .",
    "the center of the vortex has the highest surface density .",
    "although the gas surface density only increases by a factor of 2 - 3 to the center of the vortex , it can concentrate dust particles by a factor of 100 .",
    "all particle species ( except par .",
    "a ) have significant concentration within the vortex .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as shown in section 4.1 and figure [ fig : fig12 ] , the vortex in 3-d simulations does not have noticeable vertical motions within 2 scale heights .",
    "thus , without strong vertical motions at the midplane , the vortex can not stir particles up to the atmosphere , and particles should settle towards the disk midplane significantly .",
    "this expectation is confirmed in figure [ fig : fig9p1 ] , where all types of particles except par .",
    "a have settled to the disk midplane within the vortex at the inner and outer gap edges ( the inner edge vortex is at @xmath120 , and the outer edge vortex is at @xmath121 based on figure [ fig : fig9 ] ) . beyond the outer vortex at @xmath122 , there are some disturbances at the midplane to stir up the particles .",
    "these disturbances seem to come from the spiral density waves from the planet and waves excited by the vortex .",
    "the simulation also suggests that the lower the density of a region is ( either at the surface or at the outer disk ) , the higher the velocity disturbance it has . in this sense , the center of the vortex where the density is highest and the disturbance is smallest acts as a quiescent `` island '' allowing particles to settle .",
    "this result seems to be different from meheut et al .",
    "( 2012b ) who claimed that big particles are stirred to the disk atmosphere by the strong vertical motion in the vortex .    in a series of simulations by meheut et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2012a , 2012b ) , they reported strong vertical motions similar to `` convection rolls '' within the vortex . to try to reproduce these results , we set up the disk structure with a density bump in the same way as meheut et al .",
    "( 2012a ) , using the same resolution as used elsewhere in this paper .",
    "we find excellent agreements between our simulations and analytical calculations of both the rwi growth rate and eigenfunctions .",
    "since we include real passive dust particles in our simulations , we can trace the trajectory of each individual particle .",
    "however , we found that dust particles in the vortex only experience a small net vertical drag from the gas when they orbit around the vortex center .",
    "such a small vertical drag will not stop the vertical settling of particles when the particle s @xmath78 is larger than @xmath123 ( zhu & stone , in prep ) .",
    "this is consistent with our current finding that all particles in the vortex ( table 1 , @xmath124 ) settle to the disk midplane .",
    "to quantitatively measure particle concentration within the vortex , we calculate the gas and particle surface density along the @xmath4 direction across the vortex center in both 2-d and 3-d simulations ( m50d2 and m50d3 ) at 100 orbits .",
    "figure [ fig : fig7p1 ] shows such azimuthal density profiles at @xmath125 .",
    "the highest surface density along the curve corresponds to the center of the vortex . while the gas surface density increases by a factor of 2 - 3 towards the vortex center , the dust surface density can go up by a factor of 10 for par .",
    "b ( @xmath1260.02 ) and a factor of 100 for par .",
    "c ( @xmath1260.2 ) . even for par .",
    "d and par .",
    "e which have @xmath126 2 and 20 , there is significant dust concentration within the vortex .",
    "these big particles seem to concentrate at the region which is slightly ahead of the vortex in the @xmath4 direction .    in order to accumulate particles having @xmath127 or @xmath128",
    ", the vortex needs to orbit around the central star at a speed which is very close to the background keplerian speed . in this case ,",
    "dust particles which also orbit at the keplerian speed can stay in the vortex for many orbits and gradually drift towards the vortex center azimuthally . if the vortex orbits around the central star at a speed which is different from the keplerian speed , the particle trapped in with the vortex will also move in a non - keplerian speed .",
    "thus , in the keplerian reference plane , particles will experience a coriolis force which has to be balance by the drag force induced by the vortex rotation ( youdin 2010 ) . when the deviation from the keplerian speed is large enough",

    "the arrows label the positions if the vortex were to orbit around the central star at the keplerian speed of its center .",

    "again , the vortex is not perfectly steady but seems to follow the keplerian orbit quite well . assuming the distances between the peaks of these curves ( @xmath135 ) are all due to the non - keplerian rotation of the vortex within these 50 orbits",
    ", we can estimate that the vortex s orbit deviates from the keplerian orbit at most to a degree of @xmath136 generally , throughout our simulations , the vortex follows the keplerian orbit very well and particles with a large range of sizes can be trapped in the vortex . using the azimuthal drift velocity equation from birnstiel et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and the gas velocity @xmath137 at the vortex edge from figure [ fig : fig12 ] , we estimate that particles with @xmath138 can drift a distance r azimuthally within our simulation timescale of 100 orbits , which is consistent with par .",
    "e ( @xmath139 ) having some concentration in the vortex .",
    "we want to note that it is possible the vortex orbits at a slightly non - keplerian speed ( below @xmath140 deviation from the keplerian speed ) following the background gas flow .",
    "it is known that , due to the radial pressure gradient , the background disk will either rotate slightly sub - keplerian ( e.g. the pressure decreasing with the radius ) , or slightly super - keplerian ( e.g. at the gap outer edge )",
    ". however , the background flow s deviation from the keplerian speed is so small ( e.g. with our disk parameters , the deviation from the keplerian speed is only 0.125@xmath141 ) that we can not tell if the vortex follows this slightly non - keplerian background flow .",
    "if the vortex has a slightly sub - keplerian speed , it may be able to explain the particles concentration ahead of the vortex in the azimuthal direction .",
    "deviation from the keplerian speed can lead to @xmath142=0.1 with the particle s @xmath143 and the vortex s aspect ratio of 10 . ]                        when the dust stopping time @xmath113 , the eccentricity citation for particles close to the planet and at mean motion resonances becomes visible .",

    "each `` ripple '' in these figures is produced by particles finishing one eccentric orbit .",

    "e , the eccentricity damping by gas drag is apparent in the m02d2 case .",
    "this decreasing amplitude of the ripple is similar to the ripple excited by pan in saturn s rings ( cuzzi & scargle 1985 , hedman et al .",

    "it is also possible that the primary vortex at the gap edge excites density waves which steepening to shocks at large radii , leading to density pileup and vortex formation before the primary vortex disappears .",
    "whether the secondary vortex is a transient effect and what is its detailed formation mechanism need further studies .",
    "overall , a very massive planet in an inviscid disk is capable of inducing vortex whose distance from the central star is more than twice the distance of the planet from the star .",
    "however the vortex is highly elongated along the @xmath4 direction in all these cases .",
    "its radial extent is at most 0.2 @xmath33 , while azimuthally it can reach half of @xmath163 radian .",
    "paardekooper & mellema ( 2004 , 2006 ) have carried out first 2-d two fluid simulations aimed at studying particle response to the presence of the planet .",
    "the fluid approach for treating dust particles limited them to study grains with stopping time @xmath164 in disks with low mass planets which are not capable of opening gaps .",

    ", all these simulations do not exhibit rwi at the gap edges .",
    "this is either due to the shallowness of the gap opened by low mass planets ( paardekooper & mellema 2006 ) , or due to employing a relatively large viscosity @xmath168 ( paardekooper 2007 ; fouchet et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 ; ayliffe et al .  2012 ) , which prevents the development of rwi . for viscous disks , dust diffusion due to",
    "disk turbulence has been included in zhu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , which shows that dust diffusion can significantly decrease the effect of dust trapping at gap edges .",
    "lyra et al .  (",
    "2009a ) have carried out 2-d grid based hydrodynamic simulations with lagrangian particles to study planet s impact on dust particles in inviscid hydro disks , which is similar to our massive planet cases except that they run 2-d simulations with cartesian grids .",
    "they found that a significant amount of particles are trapped in l4 and l5 lagrange points and in the gap edge vortices .",
    "with self - gravity included , these particles can form earth mass planets .",
    "our work extends lyra et al .",
    "( 2009a ) : we have carried out both 2-d and 3-d simulations with cylindrical grids ( cylindrical grids have higher effective resolutions than cartesian grids for capturing rwi , as pointed out by de val - borro et al . 2007 and lyra et al .",
    "2009a ) , and explore particles with a large size range ( @xmath169 compared with @xmath170 ) .",
    "we also focus on the 3-d structure and the keplerian orbit of the vortex .",
    "they are crucial for understanding how particles are distributed in the vortex and particles of what size can be trapped .",
    "dust trapping by vortices which are produced by rwi of a dense ring has been studied by meheut ( 2012 ) using the two fluid approach .",
    "although they only follow the simulation for 3 orbits , significant dust concentration was observed .",
    "however , strong vertical motions within 1 scale height in their vortices ( also in meheut 2010 , 2012 ) , and thus strong stirring for dust particles have not been observed in our simulations .",
    "the reasons for the discrepancy will be discussed in more detail in zhu & stone ( in prep ) , where we found that , although particles undergo vertical oscillations when they orbit around the vortex center , the net height they gained over many orbits is very small . at a much longer timescale than 3 orbits , particles with @xmath124 are likely to settle to the vortex midplane .",
    "our simulations suggest that any mass planet can open gaps in both the gas and dust based on the nonlinear density wave theory ( goodman & rafikov 2001 , rafikov 2002ab ) , as long as the planet is not migrating and the disk is invisicid , which is in contrast with previous works on gap opening in dust disks .",
    "if a low mass planet ( e.g. @xmath14 ) can indeed open gaps in the gas , it will stop the replenishment of particles coming from the outside of the gap .",
    "pebble accretion ( johansen & lacerda 2010 , ormel & klahr 2010 , lambrechts & johansen 2012 ) will be significantly reduced and gas giant may form with a smaller core ( morbidelli & nesvorny 2012 ) .",
    "there are two main caveats in our present work : 1 ) dust feedback is neglected and 2 ) mri turbulence in the disk is not considered .",
    "dust feedback plays an important role in several regions of a disk having a planet .",
    "first , dust which drifts quickest in the disk / vortex also settles quickest in the disk . due to the settling",
    ", dust to gas mass ratio can reach one in the midplane of the disk , which will trigger kelvin helmholtz instability ( weidenschilling 1980 , johansen et al .",
    "2006 ) and streaming instability ( youdin & goodman 2006 , johansen & youdin 2007 ) at the midplane if the dust feedback to the gas is considered .",
    "these instabilities lead to disk turbulence which can slow down radial drift of dust particles ( bai & stone 2010b ) .",
    "second , the dust feedback at the gap edge could slow down particles trapping there ( ward 2009 ) .",
    "finally , the dust feedback may also change the structure of the vortex itself .",
    "turbulence is essential for gas accretion onto the central star .",
    "it also causes particle diffusion in the disk , which slows down particle radial drift and concentration ( youdin & lithwick 2007 ) .",
    "however , the turbulent structure of protoplanetary disks is not known very well .",
    "it is unclear if the disk is threaded by large scale magnetic fields , which will also change rwi ( tagger & pellat , 1999 ; yu & lai 2013 ) .",
    "if turbulent `` dead zone '' exists in protoplanetary disks , it can cause sharp density jumps at the `` dead zone '' edges which can also trigger rwi ( varnire & tagger 2006 ; lyra et al .",
    "2009b ; lyra & mac low 2012 ) .",
    "the `` dead zone '' can also be very massive or even subject to gravitational instability ( zhu et al .",
    "vortices at the planet - induced gap edges are very different in massive disks compared with low mass disks ( lin & papaloizou 2010 , lin 2012b , lovelace & hohfeld 2012 ) due to self - gravity .    regarding the vortices , we need to understand why they can exist over hundreds of orbits in simulations without being destroyed by the elliptical instability ( kerswell 2002 , lesur & papaloizou 2009 ) .",
    "thermodynamics and buoyancy effects can also play important roles in vortex dynamics ( lin 2013 ) .",
    "how dust particles are affected by eccentric disks is also important ( hsieh & gu 2012 , ataiee et al .",
    "ataiee et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have shown that , unlike vortex , eccentric disks can not trap particles .",
    "our simulations suggest that even a low mass planet ( e.g. several @xmath14 ) can open dust gaps / cavities in an inviscid disk ( e.g. in the `` dead zone '' ) as long as the planet is not migrating .",
    "this implies that dust gaps / cavities can be very common in protoplanetary disks , in agreement with the observation of a large number of protoplanetary disks with submm cavities ( andrews et al .",
    "furthermore , a low mass planet has an almost unnoticeable effect on the gas disk , which may explain missing cavities in near - ir polarized scattered light images ( dong et al .",
    "2012 ) and moderate disk accretion rates in some transitional disks ( espaillat et al .",
    "2012 ) .    at the sharp gap edge",
    "carved out by a massive planet , vortex can trap dust particles efficiently . the surface density of a certain size",
    "dust particles can increase by over a factor of 100 within the vortex ( figure [ fig : fig7p1 ] ) .",
    "this significant asymmetric dust concentration has been observed with carma , sma ( isella et al . 2013 ) and alma ( van der marel et al .",
    "2013 ) and can be fitted quite well with particle concentration in the vortex ( lyra & lin 2013 ) .",
    "although the observed asymmetric features seem to have a larger radial extent than that of the vortex in our simulations ( figure [ fig : fig11 ] ) , the observations only marginally resolved these asymmetric features radially and future higher resolution observations are needed to constrain the shape of these features .",
    "if the asymmetric dust feature is indeed caused by the vortex , it may imply the existence of a low - turbulent region ( e.g. the `` dead zone '' ) in protoplanetary disks , since the vortex formation is significantly suppressed in viscous disks ( de val - borro et al .",
    "2007 , zhu et al .  2012 ) .",
    "however , mri turbulent disks may behave quite differently from viscous disks regarding the vortex formation ( lyra & mac low 2012 ) .",
    "we are carrying mhd simulations to study the effect of mri turbulence on the vortex formation .",
    "our simulations suggest that the vortex orbits around the central star at the background keplerian speed .",
    "thus , if observed asymmetric features ( van der marel et al .",
    "2013 ) are indeed caused by the gap edge vortex , we should be able to detect the keplerian motion in future ( in tens of years ) .",
    "in this paper we have implemented lagrangian particles into athena using cylindrical grids to simulate gas and dust dynamics simultaneously .",
    "we have performed a systematic study on how planets affect dust distributions in protoplanetary disks by carrying out both 2-d and 3-d inviscid hydrodynamic global simulations with dust particles in the presence of a planet .",
    "the planet mass spans from well below the thermal mass ( 0.2 @xmath31 , equivalent to 8 @xmath14 ) to well above the thermal mass ( 5 @xmath31 , or 0.65 @xmath22 in 3-d simulations , and 9 @xmath22 in 2-d simulations ) .",
    "the dust size spans more than 6 orders of magnitude from the well - coupled to decoupled limits ( @xmath171 ) .    in the presence of a low mass planet with @xmath172 ,",
    "two shallow gaps in the gas start to open on each side of the planet at the distance where nonlinear spiral wakes steepen to shocks .",
    "this gap opening process is robust in both 2-d and 3-d simulations .",
    "we find that although these gaps may be barely visible in the gas disk after several hundred orbits the gaps are very prominent in the dust since even the shallow gaps in the gas change the drift speed of dust particles leading to particle pile up at the gap edge .",
    "particles also concentrate at the co - orbital region of the planet .",
    "a more massive planet can induce gaps in the gas quicker .",
    "the sharp gap edges are rossby wave unstable and develop vortices which eventually merge into a single vortex . with the continuous driving by the shock , the vortex can last more than several hundred orbits in our 2-d and 3-d simulations until the end of the simulations . the vortex can effectively trap dust particles .",
    "we find that the vortex is intrinsically 2-dimensional having no strong vertical motion within 1 disk scale height , and thus can not stir particles from the midplane to high altitudes .",
    "particles in the vortex settle to the midplane , similar to the rest of the disk .",
    "we also find that the vortex orbits around the central star at nearly the background keplerian speed .",
    "the deviation from the keplerian speed is less than @xmath140 , which is crucial for secularly trapping particles with @xmath127 and @xmath128 . in our simulations , particles with",
    "@xmath139 have significant concentration within the vortex , although smaller particles trace the structure of the vortex much better than bigger particles .",
    "we explore how particles are trapped in the gap edge vortex induced by more massive planets .",
    "a more massive planet opens a wider gap so that the gap edge vortex is further away from the central star .",
    "a 9 m@xmath173 planet induces a vortex whose distance from the central star is more than twice the distance of the planet from the star .    for particles with @xmath128 , particle eccentricity is driven up by the planet and is gradually damped by the gas drag after many orbits , forming `` ripples '' at the gap edge , similar to pan in saturn s rings .",
    "we also find significant eccentricity pumping at the mean motion resonances , which facilitates gap opening .",
    "planet gap edges and vortices can efficiently trap particles with a large range of sizes .",
    "thus , a significant amount of dust can be trapped potentially accelerating planetesimal and planet formation .",
    "they should also provide distinctive features which can be probed with alma and evla .",
    "the limitations of this work include the lack of the turbulent structure of the disk , particle feedback to the gas , and self - gravity of the dust particles .",

    "these expensive higher order integrators are not needed for this work , but can be easily implemented in future if desired .",
    "however , the coordinate transformation uses @xmath187 and @xmath188 functions which are computationally expensive .",

    "it is obvious that the determinants for both of these matrices are 1 .",
