    "the breakthrough in statistical physics due to the understanding of critical phenomena and the related development of methods has initiated vivid interdisciplinary research activity . the successful application of these methods demonstrates that the validity of the concepts to handle the problem of many interacting units reaches far beyond the traditional scope of statistical physics .",
    "vehicular traffic represents , from the point of view of statistical physics , a far from equilibrium driven system where a combination of the highway code and individual driving strategies replace the usual physical interactions between particles .",
    "of course , the approach of a physicist is quite different from that of a traffic engineer : we would like to model the typical behavior as simple as possible while the essence of some phenomena should remain unaltered though it is not our aim to describe specific traffic situations .",
    "nevertheless , one can hope a twofold gain from these type of studies : first , they could help us to understand far from equilibrium systems and , second , we strongly believe that the concepts developed in physics can contribute to the understanding of the complex phenomena related to vehicular traffic .",
    "obvious analogies to problems of physics like to kinetic theory or granular flow have motivated physicists to work in this field .",
    "in fact , natural scientists contribution to the understanding of traffic problems has already a long history @xcite .",
    "numerous articles have been published in the last couple of years investigating discrete models of highway traffic flow @xcite .",
    "it was suggested , that very simple probabilistic models based on cellular automata can reproduce features of real traffic , including a supposed transition from low density laminar flow to a high density phase , where start - stop waves are dominant .",
    "the behavior of these simple models is very complex near this transition , and up to now , is still not well understood .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we summarize the model and the method of simulation . in section",
    "[ relax ] the relaxation time analysis is presented .",
    "section [ surface ] deals with the relation of the traffic models to surface growth .",
    "the correlation functions are analyzed in section [ corr ] .",
    "the special case of no speed limit is discussed in section [ vinf ] .",
    "the paper is finished with a conclusion .",
    "in this paper we consider the cellular automata introduced by nagel and schreckenberg to describe single lane traffic @xcite .",
    "the model consists of a one - dimensional array of @xmath7 cells with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "every cell has @xmath8 states : it can be empty , or it can contain a car with velocity @xmath9 .",
    "the density of cars is @xmath3 .",
    "we perform the following steps in parallel for all cars :    = 20pt=0truecm acceleration : increase @xmath10 by @xmath11 if possible.(1a )    deceleration : decrease @xmath10 to avoid crash with the car in front .",
    "( 1b )    randomization : decrease @xmath10 by @xmath11 with probability @xmath12",
    "if possible.(1c )    movement : move forward @xmath10 sites .",
    "( 1d )    despite its simplicity this model captures several aspects of highway traffic including the free flow  jamming transition .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 can be considered as a limit speed and a usual value for it is @xmath13 .",
    "we would like to stress the importance of the third step .",
    "the fact that the model uses _ braking noise _ characterized by the probability @xmath12 is crucial .",
    "one could equally introduce random accelerations , but it can be shown , that these type of perturbations die out very quickly , see @xcite . an initial condition is needed to specify the model completely .    a convenient way to investigate the model is to draw a diagram of flow versus density , the so - called _",
    "fundamental diagram_. it is a curve with a well defined maximum at a density @xmath14 .",
    "the occurrence of density waves is related to the non  linearity of the fundamental diagram and it is expected , that the jamming transition will occur somewhere near the maximum . at low densities the flow is `` free '' with very few waves due to fluctuations ( 1c ) , which die out quickly , at high densities above the maximum start  stop waves dominate the system ; it is in the `` jammed '' state .    what is the nature of this transition ?",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that , with increasing density , the jammed regions grow in space and time and at the jamming point they form a @xmath15 dimensional interconnected infinite network .",
    "this would point to a percolation type picture for the process .",
    "however , the percolation transition depends on the geometry of the clusters , i.e. , on the microscopic definition of jams which introduces some ambiguity .",
    "moreover , it was demonstrated in @xcite that appropriate choice of the parameters leads , for any reasonable jam definition , to a percolation transition at densities much higher than the region where jams become dominant . in order to resolve this problem and to avoid the ambiguity related to the definition of the jams , in @xcite another definition of the jamming transition point",
    "was given without explicitly referring to the density waves .",
    "it was found that relaxation time of the average velocity has a maximum at a well defined density @xmath16 and the value of the maximum increases with growing system sizes .",
    "this phenomenon was interpreted in @xcite as critical slowing down and the critical point in the infinite size limit was identified with the jamming transition which turned out to be somewhat below the density at the maximum in the fundamental diagram ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the jamming transition as a second order non - equilibrium phase transition rises the question of the order parameter .",
    "one suggestion has been @xcite to take the density of jammed cars as order parameter which shows a rapid increase numerically at the same density where the relaxation time has its maximum . besides the above mentioned problem with the definition of the jam this `` order parameter '' has the disadvantage that ,",
    "due to the random braking events , there are small jams for any nonzero car density , i.e. , the order parameter would not entirely vanish even below the transition .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a detailed investigation of the jamming transition .",
    "we have studied the model with three different values of @xmath0 namely @xmath18 and @xmath19 . because of the boundary conditions the @xmath4 case means @xmath20 .",
    "it is widely believed that the @xmath21 and the @xmath22 cases differ qualitatively [ 6 ] and we have found that the case without speed limit shows interesting and unusual features .    with the upper choice of the @xmath0 parameters we can compare the three classes of models .",
    "the stationary state of the @xmath21 model is analytically exactly solvable @xcite . in addition",
    "the model has a car - hole symmetry which connects the stationary state at @xmath3 with the stationary state at @xmath23 . in the @xmath24 cases",
    "this symmetry does not exist because every @xmath25 step corresponds to the common movement of several holes .",
    "due to its relationship with other non - equilibrium models the @xmath21 model is not expected to exhibit a `` phase transition '' at a specific density while this is assumed for @xmath24 .",
    "for this reason we made simulations for the different cases and methods .",
    "we used @xmath26 for the braking probability throughout the paper . for the @xmath21 and the @xmath27 cases we used an algorithm with position and velocity coding , storing the velocities and positions of the cars in two arrays .",
    "for the @xmath28 case we used a multi - spin coding algorithm where we stored the lane @xmath29 times having @xmath7 bits for every velocity according to the system size . in the lane labeled by @xmath10",
    "the @xmath30-th bit is @xmath11 when there is a car with velocity @xmath10 at site @xmath30 and bit zero otherwise .",
    "this algorithm is faster because we can use bitwise operations .",
    "when calculating velocity correlation functions , we used the multi - spin coding algorithm only for reaching the stationary state and then switched to the position coding technique what was more appropriate for the calculations afterward .",
    "first we measured the average car velocity @xmath31 as a function of time .",
    "as an initial condition we used uniformly distributed cars with @xmath32 for all cars and averaged over several runs .",
    "the performed simulations are listed in table [ tab1 ] and table [ tab2 ] .",
    "we used the same @xmath33 definition as introduced in @xcite , namely : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the velocity - time function of cars without interaction and @xmath36 is the average velocity at the stationary state .",
    "as in @xcite we found a peak in @xmath33 as a function of the density .",
    "for the @xmath28 case @xmath37 the maximum of this peak is at @xmath38 which is smaller than @xmath39 [ fig .",
    "[ fig1],fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ] .",
    "the reason of the appearing negative relaxation times we see at fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is that in this density region the average velocity function @xmath40 has a maximum after a fast increase for short times and it relaxes from this maximum to the stationary state [ fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ] .",
    "every timestep during this relaxation gives a negative contribution to @xmath33 .",
    "assuming that @xmath41 we can fit @xmath42 . on the other hand @xmath43 the half - width of the @xmath33 peaks is roughly the same .",
    "therefore , in contrast to our earlier study with @xmath44 , we have here no implication to assume a @xmath45 scaling form and we could not do any finite size scaling .    in the @xmath21 case @xmath46 as well known and @xmath47 [ fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ] .",
    "the curves seem to be more similar than in the @xmath28 case and they seem to have the same form for different system sizes . the value of the @xmath48 exponent is @xmath49 .",
    "this value seems to be universal for all the @xmath0 parameters taking notice of @xcite too .",
    "however , in the @xmath21 case this behavior is not bound to @xmath16 but it can be obtained in a broad range of the density .    looking for a different definition of a relaxation time we tried to fit a @xmath50 function on the measured @xmath40 functions . here",
    "@xmath36 is the average velocity in the stationary state and @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath33 are fitting parameters .",
    "we began the fit after the first increasing regime which consists of @xmath53-@xmath54 steps because then the car movements are nearly independent and therefore the @xmath40 graph is roughly a straight line .    for every fit the value of the @xmath33 exponent arose as a greater value than the corresponding system size .",
    "the exponent was vague to fit and had a great error because its effect falls in the regime of the fluctuations around @xmath55 the stationary value of @xmath40 . in the @xmath28 case",
    "we could fit only in a restricted density region because of the shape of @xmath40 described above .    in the @xmath21 case",
    "the received values of the @xmath52 exponent were the same within errors .",
    "their value is @xmath56 .",
    "this value is near to @xmath57 .",
    "this value can be interpreted in terms of a mapping to the kpz surface growth problem ( see the next section ) .    in the @xmath28 case the value of the @xmath52 exponent increases from @xmath58 to @xmath59 in the measured density region [ fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ] .",
    "we have an upper density limit for the fits because of the emerging maximum in @xmath40 [ fig .  [ fig3 ] ] .",
    "with an appropriate conversion this traffic model can be transformed into a surface growth model @xcite . the transformation is as follows .",
    "we go along the lane from left to right and order a slant line to every lattice site whose length is @xmath60lattice spacing and bevels with an angle @xmath61 from the lane . at every step we order a line with a slope of @xmath62 to a car and a line with a slope of @xmath63 to a hole .",
    "we always continue this emerging zig - zag line at the end of it and we make a step upward or downward according to whether we find a hole or a car . after every update of the traffic model we get a surface in this model .",
    "the update of the traffic model determines the update of the surface growth model [ fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ] .    if the density @xmath64 the surface has a density dependent average steepness of @xmath65 because the difference of the two ends of the surface is @xmath66 .",
    "in the @xmath21 case the surface growth picture corresponds to a deposition model in which we drop squares with their corner downward in every local valley with probability @xmath67 as we go from left to right .",
    "the squares have an edge of @xmath60lattice spacing .",
    "the deposition of a square corresponds to a step with velocity @xmath68 in the traffic model .",
    "this simple deposition picture does not hold for the @xmath28 case because there are @xmath69 steps also which would correspond to the deposition of a rectangle or correlated deposition of squares .    in our simulations we measured",
    "the time dependence of the average surface width @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the height at site @xmath30 , @xmath72 means averaging over the sites and @xmath73 is the average height function @xmath74 in a broad class of growth models @xmath75 behaves according to the kardar - parisi - zhang theory @xcite that is @xmath76 and @xmath77 the simple deposition model corresponding to the @xmath21 case is known to belong to this universality class @xcite .    as initial condition we used equally distributed cars . for the uniformly distributed initial condition we received large fluctuations and",
    "have not seen any regularity . in that case",
    "we saw the same behavior as in the system with equally distributed initial condition after relaxation .",
    "we subtracted the average steepness from the surface height in order to calculate @xmath78 .",
    "the performed simulations are listed in table [ tab3 ] and table [ tab4 ] .    in the @xmath21 case in the whole density region",
    "we see kpz - like behavior [ fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ] and we received @xmath79 and @xmath80 which should be compared to the kpz values @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this kpz - like behavior explains the @xmath57-close value of the @xmath52 exponent received from the relaxation time analysis ( [ xexp ] ) because the velocity of the cars : @xmath83 that is , @xmath84 according to @xcite : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "the exponent @xmath89 corresponds to our @xmath52 exponent and is in one dimension @xmath90 .    in the @xmath28 case",
    "the shape of the @xmath78 curves is also kpz - like .",
    "we measured @xmath91 to be @xmath92 .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath21 case the @xmath93 exponent depends on the density as visible on [ fig .  [ fig8 ] ] and it is not uniform as in the @xmath21 case .",
    "finally we studied the velocity correlation function in the space of car series with the definition @xmath94 or @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the velocity of the @xmath97-th car at time @xmath98 and @xmath99 means averaging over all cars and @xmath100 is a time when the system is in the steady state .",
    "being in the stationary state @xmath101 is independent of @xmath100 .",
    "if we consider the function @xmath101 at a constant time @xmath98 as a function of @xmath30 , we find a peak centered at the value @xmath102 the maximum of the peak decreases with increasing @xmath98 [ fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ] .",
    "@xmath103 because that is the autocorrelation function but for greater times it appears at other car indexes . considering the @xmath104 versus @xmath98 graph",
    "we can fit a straight line on the @xmath104 values which lines steepness depends on the density .",
    "this steepness defines a velocity in the car series space with which the peak spreads .    except for the peak",
    "the @xmath101 function fluctuates around a constant value and it forms a plateau .    from the definition of @xmath101",
    "it follows that the jammed cars do not contribute to @xmath101 since they are staying .",
    "the cars already accelerated near @xmath0 give contribution to the plateau of @xmath101 .",
    "those cars give contribution to the peak which accelerate in a correlated manner because a car accelerating makes place to the car behind to accelerate .",
    "these are the cars coming out of a jam .",
    "therefore the longterm existence of the peak and its velocity characterizes the traffic jams in the system .    in the @xmath21 case the @xmath105 velocity of the peak increases without any sign of criticality from zero to its value at @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "this value follows from the motion of one single hole [ fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ] .",
    "however , in the @xmath28 case we can see a bending at the @xmath108 function at the density @xmath109 where the function shows a steep increase [ fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ] .",
    "this implies emerging traffic jams .",
    "the small @xmath108 values of the function below @xmath110 come from the small fugitive jams being in the system .",
    "it is tempting to interpret the bending in @xmath108 as the appearance of a new phase at @xmath110 , since the behavior of the peak velocity is reminiscent to an order parameter of second order phase transitions .",
    "however , the velocity does not go to zero at the bending point and  in contrast to what is expected for second order transitions  we could not observe any finite size scaling .",
    "our simulations have indicated the following : i ) the behavior @xmath24 is different from @xmath21 ii ) for @xmath24 there is a jamming transition but a careful study of the different characteristics indicated  in contrast to what was suggested in @xcite  that there is no clear second order phase transition related .",
    "iii ) from the present and earlier studies @xcite it is clear that the smaller @xmath12 the more pronounced is the transition .",
    "iv ) comparing our results for @xmath28 with those with @xmath44 we realize that increasing @xmath0 also sharpens the transition .",
    "the origin of iii ) is clear : in the @xmath111 model there is a phase transition related to a singularity in the fundamental diagram . in order to see the origin of iv )",
    "we considered the case without speed limit , more precisely the @xmath20 case .",
    "the fundamental diagram of the @xmath27 case shows different features than the cases discussed so far [ fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ] .",
    "the main characteristics of its shape is a plateau value depending on @xmath12 [ fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ] .",
    "the function decreases fast to this plateau .",
    "the height of the plateau is independent of the system size only its length changes with .    looking at the flow of the cars we can observe that at the densities where the current of the stationary state @xmath112 is higher than the @xmath113 plateau value the cars tend to be equally distributed what is typical for the deterministic case @xcite",
    ". however , at the density regime of the plateau we see one jam which characterizes this density region [ fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ] . for higher densities where @xmath112 decreases with the density",
    "we see more than one jam .    calculating the ( [ cfunct ] ) correlation function",
    "we can notice that the @xmath55 peak velocity in the plateau region corresponds to @xmath113 which also means that we have only one jam in the system for this densities .",
    "assuming that the @xmath114 value where the plateau sets in depends on @xmath7 like @xmath115 we got @xmath116 . because this point represents the @xmath117 number of cars being in the flow between the right and left side of the jam we can conclude that the density contribution of cars in the flow part scales as @xmath118 and therefore the density contribution of the cars being in the jam will be @xmath119 @xmath120 thus values greater than the @xmath113 plateau value of @xmath112 ( except the value at @xmath121 ) can be considered as fluctuation effects . when @xmath5 we have finite number of cars with infinite velocity ( one car with velocity @xmath122 ) . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath123",
    "therefore we can say that in the thermodynamic limit we have a phase transition at @xmath121 between the phases of @xmath124 and no jams and of the @xmath125 value with one jam .",
    "increasing @xmath3 the plateau ceases and there are more than one jams in the system .",
    "this result contradicts the result of the mean field theory described in @xcite where the fundamental diagram starts in the @xmath121 @xmath126 point with infinite slope .    for smaller braking probabilities than @xmath127",
    "the plateau ceases and only a break in the graph remains .",
    "according to our comparison of the three different models we can conclude to the following . as we summarized at the beginning of section 6 there is a difference between the behavior of the models @xmath21 and @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast with the @xmath21 model in the @xmath28 case we see a kind of transition but it is not a strict second order transition it seems to be a crossover transition .",
    "we found that the density at which the transition takes place is smaller then the @xmath128 value mentioned in @xcite . on the grounds of the obtained results for @xmath27 where we found a first order transition we can conclude the the increase of the @xmath0 parameter makes the transition more striking .",
    "our results indicate that the behavior of the models labeled by different @xmath12 and @xmath0 parameters is guided by the transition points of the models with parameters @xmath111 or @xmath27 .",
