    "an important observational constraint on the acceleration and transport processes in solar flares is imposed by x - ray arrival time delay measurements @xcite .",
    "it is observed that the non - thermal hard x - ray emission consists of two separable components , a smooth , slowly varying background , and a pulsed , rapidly varying modulation .",
    "detailed studies of the temporal structure of the two components show that they possess several opposite characteristics : typically , the variations in the smooth component are first observed at lower energies , then at increasingly higher energy .",
    "the arrival time delay between @xmath0kev and @xmath1 kev electrons is of order @xmath2s .",
    "conversely , the pulses are observed first in the highest energies , with lower energy photons appearing later ; the lag time for @xmath0kev photons relative to @xmath1kev photons is of order @xmath3ms .",
    "the trap - precipitation model of @xcite offers one possible explanation for the time delay measurements . in this model",
    ", electrons are accelerated to high energy above the loop in the turbulent downflow and are then injected into the closed flare loop on the pulse time scale .",
    "some electrons are trapped between magnetic compressions in the loop before precipitating onto the chromosphere , while the remainder precipitate directly .",
    "the two populations produce the smooth and pulsed components respectively .",
    "although the trap precipitation model may plausibly account for the time delay observations in some flares , some significant uncertainties remain . while the needed injection may arise naturally as a feature of many acceleration models which are situated in the reconnection current sheet ( i.e. @xcite ) , it is not clear how injection would take place in models which employ acceleration in the turbulent downflow region which may form between the reconnection sheet and the closed soft x - ray loops .",
    "in addition , @xcite argue that the pulsed structure can be produced by fluctuations in spectral hardness instead of a pulsed injection of non - thermal electrons . furthermore , the model predicts that coronal x - ray emission emanates from within the trap region .",
    "the trap precipitation model places the trap , and thus this emission site , within the closed flare loop itself .",
    "this is seemingly at odds with at least some observations , such as those of of @xcite which reveal a compact non - thermal source above the loop - top during the main phase of some flares .",
    "another disadvantage of the trap precipitation model is that it does not retain temporal information of the acceleration process ; such information is lost at the injection point .",
    "a different scenario in which the properties of the acceleration mechanism are more closely linked to the emission may provide more opportunity to test both the time delay mechanism and the acceleration mechanism observationally .",
    "we propose a new model called the `` shock reprocessing model '' as just such an alternative ; it circumvents the loop injection problem , places the coronal emission above the loop - top , and retains some details of the acceleration mechanism in the footpoint emission .",
    "the shock reprocessing model employs both second order stochastic fermi acceleration ( stfa ) and first order acceleration at fast shocks .",
    "electrons are accelerated via stfa in the turbulent downflow region located below the reconnection point .",
    "due to the fairly long acceleration time , typically a few seconds , variations on the eddy time , @xmath4s , are smoothed out in the temporal spectrum of the stfa accelerated population .",
    "stfa , operating on a time scale of a few seconds , produces the smooth component of the x - ray emission described in @xcite .",
    "as the flow impinges upon the flare loop , typical flow speeds are marginally super - magnetosonic ( e.g. blackman & field 1994 ) . a weakly compressive fast shock forms .",
    "because the flow is only marginally super - magnetosonic , the shock can disappear and reform as the flow speed fluctuates on the eddy time .",
    "this is a key feature of the shock reprocessing model .",
    "first order fermi acceleration occurs at the fast shock and the transient nature of the shock can be responsible for the pulsed emission structure observed in impulsive solar flares .",
    "furthermore , the shock is strongest above the apex of the loop , and diminishes toward the wings .",
    "the shock formation condition is typically met over a portion of the loop ; as a result , only a fraction of the stfa accelerated electrons undergo the second phase of acceleration ..    we discuss the details of the acceleration mechanisms in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we determine the range of shock parameters required by the shock reprocessing model , as well as a simple model of shock formation .",
    "in particular , we calculate the compression ratio and spatial filling fraction of the shocks . in section 4",
    "we discuss the role of cooling in the stfa region in matching the observed smooth component time delays and the presence of loop - top emission sites in a small fraction of yohkoh flares , such as the masuda flare @xcite .",
    "the distinct presence of these x - ray sources just above and exterior to the loop - top is a distinguishable feature of the shock reprocessing model when compared to the trap precipitation model .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "before examining the shock reprocessing model in depth , we briefly review models of flare morphology and some properties of stfa and shock fermi acceleration which will later be employed .",
    "it is well understood that solar flares are driven by magnetic reconnection in the solar corona ( i.e. , @xcite ) .",
    "the reconnected field lines relax into a closed loop structure evidenced by the soft x - ray loops which are filled with hot plasma .",
    "hard x - rays are observed at the chromospheric footpoints of the closed loops as well coronal hard x - ray sources in some flare .",
    "the acceleration mechanisms responsible for the hard - xray producing electrons are not yet fully known ; candidates include dc field acceleration @xcite , stochastic acceleration @xcite , and shock acceleration @xcite , or combinations of these processes @xcite . further complicating",
    "the issue is that the downflow plasma between the reconnection point and the relaxed loops may either be laminar or turbulent .",
    "laminar flow would favor stationary @xciteand collapsing @xcite trap precipitation models of electron acceleration , which require an ordered field structure .",
    "turbulent downflow would favor stochastic acceleration models , which require turbulent field structure .",
    "in addition , there are two possible directions of motion to consider for the evolution of the reconnection point .",
    "the standard model ( i.e. @xcite ) focuses on the vertical direction of motion in which the reconnection point moves upward through the corona over time . as a result",
    ", the footpoint separation and height of the soft x - ray loop increases with time .",
    "however , recent observations with rhessi indicate that at some flares have a `` zipper '' morphology ; the reconnection evolves laterally along an arcade structure at near constant height , with the soft x - ray loop following the reconnection point along the arcade at near constant footpoint separation and loop height @xcite .",
    "regardless of the direction of motion of the reconnection point , a 2-d cross section of flare morphology is shown in figure [ cartoon ] .",
    "the region labelled outflow may be either turbulent or laminar , depending on the local alfvn speed and the initial gradient in the downflow across the downflow cross section ( chieuh & zweibel 1987 ) .",
    "the shock reprocessing model focuses primarily on the vertically evolution with turbulent downflows .",
    "it is important to note that there is also a variety of coronal hard x - ray emission characteristics observed .",
    "the discovery event , dubbed the masuda flare @xcite , shows hard x - rays above the closed loop with a non - thermal kernel @xcite as well as a very hot thermal region . on the other hand",
    ", many coronal sources appear to be wholly thermal @xcite .",
    "some are located inside the soft x - ray loops , not above @xcite .",
    "the variety of x - ray emission properties and reconnection morphologies implies that even if all solar flares result from a basic reconnection environment and a soft x - ray loop , they are not explained within a single scenario of specific processes such as trap precipitation or shock reprocessing .",
    "key elements , such as laminar vs. turbulent downflow may determine the differences between some classes of flares .",
    "a necessary condition for turbulence to form in the reconnection outflow , super - alfvnic downflow speeds , is also an approximate result of reconnection outflows @xcite .",
    "ultimately , models which consider flares with and without turbulent downflows need to be comparatively explored .",
    "stfa is capable of accelerating solar flare electrons out of a thermal population @xcite and up to high energies with a spectral shape that depends mainly on the mechanism which traps electrons in the acceleration region . in the reconnection outflow , trapping is provided by wave particle interactions which also serve as the pitch angle scattering necessary to sustain acceleration @xcite . below a transition energy @xmath5kev , pitch angle scattering in solar flares occurs through interactions with whistler waves . in the presence of these waves",
    ", stfa produces a quasi - thermal electron spectrum below @xmath6 . above @xmath6 , the scattering mode required to produce a power law spectrum",
    "is constrained but undetermined .",
    "this remains a key unresolved issue for stfa . in order to produce a power law",
    ", the pitch angle scattering length must be inversely proportionl to the electron energy @xmath7 @xcite    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the pitch angle scattering length scale , @xmath10 is the linear size of the acceleration region , and @xmath11 is a proportionality constant which is fixed by the scattering physics .",
    "the resulting spectrum has the form    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the number of electrons with kinetic energy @xmath7 , and the spectral index @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the proton mass and @xmath17 is the local mean alfvn speed in the plasma .",
    "variations in @xmath11 , resulting from local changes in the pitch angle scattering length scale , produce the observed range of spectral indexes among flares . typically , stfa electron ( x - ray ) spectra have a mean index of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "shock fermi acceleration had been considered as a means of producing the power law electrons required to explain flare x - rays , for example @xcite .",
    "a stationary fast shock can form at the point where the turbulent reconnection outflow plows into the loop .",
    "this shock , located just above the top of the loop , can accelerate electrons into a power law distribution .    shock fermi acceleration is well studied @xcite . in the standard theory , charged particles gain energy from repeated transits across the shock . since there is a net energy gain in each cycle ,",
    "the process is first order and results in a rapid acceleration .",
    "the energy spectrum produced by shock fermi acceleration in impulsive solar flares in the non - relativistic regime is a power law of the form    @xmath19    where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the compression ratio across the shock ( e.g. jones & ellison 1991 ) .",
    "furthermore , the shock compression ratio is related to the downflow mach number @xmath22    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the adiabatic index of the plasma . from simple theoretical estimates ,",
    "it is expected that the shocks are weakly compressive ( blackman & field 1994 ; blackman 1997 ) . to fit the observationally inferred electron spectrum @xcite of @xmath25",
    "requires a compression ratio @xmath26 , significantly less than the maximum of @xmath27 for a non - cooling shock , and consistent with theoretical predictions .",
    "weak fast shocks are expected , but standard shock fermi acceleration also requires injection of high energy electrons which satisfy two conditions : their gyro - radius must be larger than the shock thickness ( roughly the thermal proton gyro - radius ) to see the shock as thin , and the electrons must be energetic enough to scatter off of upstream alfvn waves @xcite . the threshold energy , @xmath28 for injection at impulsive solar flare shocks is found to depend on the angle of obliquity between the normal to the shock surface and magnetic field lines , and ranges from @xmath29kev at @xmath30deg to @xmath31kev at @xmath32deg @xcite . herein we propose that stfa , in the presence of pitch scattering by whistler waves , is the shock acceleration injection mechanism ; it accelerates electrons from the background plasma to energies above the proton thermal energy .",
    "note that this scenario differs from that of @xcite in which whistler waves are also called upon as a scattering mechanism , but the acceleration is single stage ; all electron acceleration takes place at the shock in their model .",
    "the electron spectrum from fast shock acceleration following stfa in the presence of whistler waves is can be reproduced in some stfa models without shock acceleration , although the spectrum from shocks depend only on the compression ratio . however , in the case with shocks , the transition to a power law spectrum occurs at the shock injection energy , @xmath28 , instead of at @xmath6 .",
    "a similarity between stfa and shocks is that both have difficulty in producing downward spectral breaks from an initially steep spectrum but can produce upward breaks ( hardening ) .",
    "it has been established by @xcite for example , that processing of an electron population by a shock can harden an already existing power law distribution , with spectral index @xmath33 , or reduce the index below @xmath33 , but can not soften it , or raise the index above @xmath33 .",
    "if there is a power law spectrum downstream of a shock with a low energy cutoff below the injection energy and the shock is sufficiently strong , the upstream spectrum will be harder above @xmath28 but remain unchanged below @xmath28 .",
    "this property is important to the shock reprocessing model .",
    "in the following section , we present the shock reprocessing model and compare it to the trap precipitation model of brown and melrose ( 1976 ) .      observations of non - thermal x - ray emission at the footpoints of solar flares indicate that the observed emission can be divided into two components , a smoothly varying part and a rapidly varying set of pulses @xcite .",
    "observations in multiple energy bands show that for the smooth component , variations in x - ray intensity arrive first at lower energies , and later at higher energies .",
    "the pulses exhibit an opposite time delay structure ; variations are seen first in higher energy bands .",
    "the series of papers by aschwanden and collaborators @xcite models the x - ray arrival time observations in solar flares within the trap precipitation model .",
    "we propose the shock reprocessing model as an alternative .    in the trap precipitation model ( fig .",
    "[ trapprecip ] ) , reconnection occurs high above the flare loop .",
    "electrons are then accelerated to high energies above the loop over a short time scale , resulting in a pool of non - thermal electrons in a near equilibrium distribution .",
    "an injection event somehow loads a pulse of electrons , with an energy spectrum matching that of the pool above the loop - top , onto the loop .",
    "injection occurs over a very short time , @xmath3ms , matching the observed x - ray pulse durations .",
    "injected electrons travel down the flare loop , where they encounter a magnetic mirror as the loop field lines converge .",
    "electrons with sufficiently high pitch angle relative to the local field are trapped at the mirror , while those with small pitch angle stream through .",
    "this divides the electrons into two populations : directly precipitating , and trap precipitating electrons .",
    "the directly precipitating electrons do not reflect at the mirror , and proceed directly to the dense footpoint region .",
    "there they emit x - rays via thick target bremsstrahlung ; these electrons retain the short pulse time scale of the injection , and thus produce the pulsed emission component . since the pulse electrons are injected simultaneously at all energies , the main time dispersion of a pulse results from time of flight down the loop , with higher energy ( faster ) electrons arriving earlier than lower energy ( slower ) electrons , consistent with the pulse observations .",
    "the second population , trap precipitated electrons , are mirrored at the magnetic field compressions due to their large pitch angles .",
    "these electrons remain trapped between the mirrors on opposite sides of the flare loop until such time as their pitch angles scatter to sufficiently small values that they can pass through the mirrors .",
    "@xcite find that the slow time delays are consistent with loop - top trapping , where escape from the trap is governed by the collisional scattering time which varies as @xmath34 . because the trapping time is significantly longer than the injection time , electrons from many injections escape together , creating a smooth component . as a result of the positive energy dependence of the trapping time ,",
    "lower energy electrons escape the trap earlier than higher energy electrons , and the smooth emission component exhibits variations at lower energies first .",
    "the trap precipitation model offers an explanation for the two component emission , as well as the time delay data .",
    "however , it is not unique .",
    "the shock reprocessing model is an alternative to trap precipitation .",
    "an outline of the model is shown in fig .",
    "[ reprocessing ] . as in trap precipitation ,",
    "the shock reprocessing model begins with reconnection high above the flare loop , followed by acceleration above the loop - top .",
    "however , in the shock reprocessing model the initial acceleration is slow and consistent with stfa in the reconnection outflow , occurring on a time scale of @xmath35s @xcite .",
    "following stfa , the electrons flow into the region just above the loop - top . at or just above the loop - top a weakly compressive fast shock forms @xcite .",
    "the shock can vary in spatial extent and compression ratio .",
    "a fraction of the stfa accelerated electrons also pass through the shock and are accelerated a second time ( reprocessed ) .",
    "the remainder pass directly to the flare footpoints .",
    "like the trap precipitation model , the shock reprocessing model involves two populations of electrons , but in this case they are the directly streaming ( stfa only ) electrons and the shock reprocessed electrons .",
    "the directly streaming electrons produce the smooth x - ray component . since there is no trapping or injection within this model , variability in the produced emission results solely from the acceleration process .",
    "the @xmath36 s acceleration time for stfa @xcite is consistent with the delay time observed between @xmath0kev and @xmath1kev electrons in flare observations @xcite .",
    "the reprocessed electrons are those which pass through the shock and undergo a second , rapid acceleration .",
    "subsequently , they travel without coronal trapping to the footpoints . because the shock acceleration time scale is extremely short ,",
    "reprocessed electrons can be considered effectively injected at the loop - top simultaneously across all energies .",
    "the number of electrons which are reprocessed is determined by the spatial extent of the shock .",
    "we proceed by developing a phenomenological procedure for determining pulse strengths , discussing shock formation and geometry as further constraints on the model , and predicting the location of the coronal emission site coincident with the stfa and cooling in a region above the loop - top .",
    "the absence of an above the loop - top , or loop - top trap is a key distinction between shock reprocessing and trap precipitation models .",
    "expansion of the closed loop is often assumed to occur near the loop - top and is a requirement of the trap precipitation model to create the trap in the form of a magnetic mirror .",
    "recently however , @xcite presents observational and theoretical evidence against the formation of a trap , finding instead that the loops are very nearly axially symmetric from footpoint to apex .",
    "this poses a challenge to the static trap models which require narrowing loop cross sections at the footpoints and broader loop cross sections at the apex .",
    "the filling fraction of the shock , @xmath37 , can be understood as both the fraction of the downflow cross section which encounters the shock , and as the fraction of non - thermal electrons which are reprocessed .",
    "note that this sets the firm upper bound @xmath38 .",
    "the physics relating @xmath37 to shock formation is deferred to section 3.4 . here",
    ", we constrain @xmath37 from observations and power law models of the electron and x - ray spectra .",
    "we begin by assuming that the electron spectrum resulting from stfa is a single power law , given by    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the total number of electrons per unit energy per unit time passing through a slab of unit surface area coplanar with the shock ( henceforth we refer to similar quantities as areal fluxes ) , and is therefore the total non - thermal electron population , as a function of energy .",

    "the total number of non - thermal electrons is then given by    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the total number of non - thermal electrons and @xmath46 is the area of the downflow . because of the injection criterion , shock reprocessing does not increase the total number of non - thermal electrons . as a result",

    "we define the smooth and pulsed emission as follows .",

    "the conditions for shock formation are met in a small fraction of flares , and then only marginally , resulting in weakly compressive downstream shocks in some flares , and no downstream shocks in others @xcite .",
    "the low shock formation rate may explain the infrequent detection of non - thermal loop - top emission .",
    "it has also been argued @xcite that the non - thermal loop - top source is actually prevalent in impulsive flares , but usually very dim , with typical intensity less than one tenth that of the footpoint sources .",
    "the contrast limit of yohkoh is roughly @xmath31 ; observations are limited to unusually bright loop - top sources or limb flares with obscured footpoint emission .",
    "we show that the shock reprocessing model is consistent with the latter scenario if stfa takes place in the above the loop - top emission region , and is accompanied by _ in situ _ bremsstrahlung cooling of the electron population .",
    "that being said , there are recent rhessi observations of two flares which are dominated by coronal emission that is cospatial with the soft x - ray loop @xcite .",
    "we consider this latter issue further in section 5 .",
    "although the masuda flare exhibits pulses , they are longer in duration than the footpoint pulses .",
    "loop - top pulses are typically of duration @xmath120s @xcite , as opposed to the sub - second pulse structure in the footpoint emission . the pulsed component to which we attribute shock reprocessing",
    "is the sub - second pulse structure in the footpoint emission , not the much longer pulses which may come from a globally bursty reconnection .",
    "when the sub - second pulses are subtracted from the emission profile the remaining component we refer to as the smooth profile . in this respect , in addition to explaining the sporadic appearance of above the loop - top non - thermal sources , cooled stfa also produces the proper time delays for the smooth emission component .",
    "@xcite analyzes the arrival time delays for the smoothly varying x - ray component of 78 flares . from these ,",
    "they obtain plasma densities in the soft x - ray loops for 44 events , rejecting the remaining 34 . of the rejected events ,",
    "29 were unsuitable to the analysis technique because the fast varying component could not be sufficiently deconvolved from the smooth component .",
    "the remaining 5 rejections were due to poor convergence of their fitting model .",
    "the remaining 44 flares have smooth component time delays consistent with the trap precipitation model , matching the predicted trapping time @xmath121 .",
    "this effect is also predicted by our shock reprocessing model . in shock reprocessing , the pre - shock stfa acceleration rate",
    "is expected to determine the smooth variation time delays .",
    "variations in the smooth component are the result of changes in the stfa acceleration region , and appear at high energy on a time scale equal to the stfa acceleration time to that energy .",
    "the time delay curve should thus be obtained from the stfa acceleration rate :    @xmath122    where q(e ) is prescribed by stfa .",
    "we define    @xmath123    for non - relativistic stfa @xmath124 is energy independent @xcite and @xmath125 . for statistical acceleration in the quasi - linear regime",
    ", @xcite finds the standard result : @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "neither of these forms is consistent with a good fit to @xmath128 .",
    "cooling in the acceleration region , which is neglected by @xcite can be invoked to reduce the acceleration rate .",
    "consider the case where stfa with _ in situ _ cooling by bremsstrahlung occurs in a region above the loop - top shock .",
    "the power loss due to bremsstrahlung for a single electron is given by @xcite    @xmath129    where the dimensionless electron density @xmath130@xmath131 , @xmath132kev , and we have assumed a constant gaunt factor @xmath133 .",
    "notice the linear density dependence for the bremsstrahlung rate , which arises because we consider the mean cooling rate for a single electron in a background of protons at density @xmath134 ( not the emission from an ensemble of electrons in a background of protons ) .",
    "@xmath124 is thus given by    @xmath135    where we have adopted the stfa acceleration rate of @xcite , which reexamined the stfa process and determined that , due to averaging over the limited range of pitch angles which are subject to reflection , as opposed to all pitch angles , the mean acceleration term dominates over the diffusive random walk component in the sub - relativistic regime .",
    "taking the flare electron density to be @xmath136 and performing the integral in equation [ tauexpr ] yields the function shown in fig .",
    "[ taufig ] where we plot @xmath137 for both cooled and uncooled stfa as well as the empirical fit of @xmath128 .",
    "cooled stfa is consistent with the time delay measurements of @xcite over the observed energy range of @xmath138kev , provided we ignore collisional energy transfer to the protons .",
    "we follow @xcite in taking such collisional losses to be negligible at energies above @xmath139kev , where the energy loss time is long compared to the travel time of an electron from the acceleration region to the footpoints .",
    "we now discuss coulomb collisions further .",
    "it has previously been noted @xcite that coulomb losses due to electron - electron scattering are typically greater than the bremsstrahlung cooling rate at hard x - ray energies in flare plasmas . while this is true , within the stfa acceleration region",
    ", the electrons spectrum is nearly thermal .",
    "the non - thermal post - acceleration spectrum results from the escape rate of electrons from the acceleration region @xcite and thus the escaped electrons . for",
    "the distribution within the acceleration region , coulomb scattering among electrons does not strongly affect a given electron s acceleration time ; on average , each electron receives as much as much energy due to coulomb scattering as it loses .",
    "coulomb scattering with protons is , however , a potential cooling mechanism , since solar flare protons are sub - alfvnic and do not participate in stfa .",
    "the coulomb loss rate for electron - proton scattering is given by @xcite    @xmath140    the electron - proton loss rate is significantly lower than the bremmstrahlung loss rate , and electron cooling within the limited stfa acceleration region is dominated by the latter process .",
    "this result holds because the plasma flow participating in stfa contains an already nearly thermal electron population which is not interacting with cooler electrons . in the surrounding area , which is filled with ambient plasma",
    ", stfa accelerated electrons which have escaped the acceleration region do interact with the surrounding cooler electrons , resulting in cooling of the electrons , reshaping of the spectrum , and heating of the plasma .",
    "this heated plasma may emit the thermal loop - top x - ray component observed in a number of flares .",
    "energy loss due to loop - top bremmstrahlung cooling is significant for high energy electrons where the total energy lost to cooling is greater than the electron energy when it leaves the acceleration region .",
    "the energy lost to cooling is released in x - ray luminosity .",
    "this is a plausible source of the weak non - thermal loop - top emission regions observed in yohkoh studies of flares @xcite .",
    "three major observational constraints on any model of electron acceleration in impulsive solar flares are the production of proper pulse strengths , the energy dependent arrival time delays , and the appearance of loop - top emission sites in only a fraction of observed flares .",
    "the shock reprocessing model successfully accounts for all three of these features through a two stage acceleration process . in the first phase ,",
    "electrons are accelerated via stfa with appreciable thin target bremsstrahlung cooling in the turbulent downflow region above the flare loop .",
    "the cooling of trapped electrons produces the loop - top source , which is often too dim relative to the footpoints to be observed by yohkoh .",
    "subsequently , a portion of the electron population undergoes diffusive shock acceleration at a weakly compressive stationary fast shock , splitting the electrons into two populations : the shock reprocessed pulse population , and the unshocked stfa population .",
    "sub - second pulses result from modulation of the shock strength on short time scales .",
    "since the predicted shocks are only weakly compressive , small changes in the reconnection outflow can remove or reestablish the shock .",
    "the presence of the shock below the loop - top emission site implies that the pulse structure observed in footpoint x - rays , and generated by variations in the shock compression ratio , are not present in loop - top sources .",
    "this prediction of the shock reprocessing model needs to be tested , and should be feasible over time as the rhessi dataset grows to include large numbers of flares with detectable loop - top sources .",
    "@xcite find evidence of a smoothly varying loop - top emission source in three rhessi observed flares .",
    "there is no apparent pulse structure in these sources .",
    "however , @xcite argue that these coronal sources are distinct from masuda flare type loop - top emission sources .",
    "the observations of @xcite show a two component emission structure , with both pulsed and smooth emission , superficially similar to the footpoints .",
    "however , in these sources , the pulse time scale is typically @xmath31s or larger , not sub - second as in the footpoints .",
    "the coronal pulses are attributed to modulations in either the reconnection or downflow environment .",
    "they are not inconsistent with the shock reprocessing model",
    ". still , larger sampling statistics on variability in loop - top emission sources would be of great interest in determining the applicability of the shock reprocessing model to impulsive solar flares .",
    "an additional concern for any model of solar flares is the electron supply problem .",
    "for example , the hard x - rays emitted in the masuda flare require a non - thermal electron throughput of @xmath141s@xmath142 @xcite .",
    "the reconnection downflow for the same flare contained @xmath143 electrons s@xmath142 @xcite .",
    "thus the electron acceleration mechanism must either be highly efficient , accelerating a fraction of the downflow electrons of order unity , or a secondary supply of electrons must be available .",
    "stfa falls into the first category ; the process is highly efficient , so the problem of supplying a sufficent flux of electrons is alleviated . since the bulk plasma flows downward to the footpoints , including both the electron and proton populations , charge neutrality is maintained without the need to rely upon a return current .",
    "shock reprocessing also makes predictions regarding the pulsed emission .",
    "because the pulse component of the emission is caused by the harder shock reprocessed spectrum , the observed pulse magnitude is dependent on the energy bin , where higher energy bins show larger pulse strengths . from eq .",
    "( [ mpeqn ] ) , @xmath144 , where @xmath84 is the relative pulse strength , and @xmath63 is the minimum energy of the observations . notice that raising @xmath63 increases the pulse strength . in its",
    "simplest discussed herein , shock reprocessing predicts that observations in a sequence of energy bins would show stronger pulses at higher energies .",
    "obtaining such data is within the capability of current instrumentation .",
    "the magnitude of the effect can be calculated by evaluating eq .",
    "[ mpeqn ] multiple times , with @xmath63 taken to be the lower energy limit of each detection band .",
    "this provides the pulse strength for all x - ray emission at photon energy @xmath145 . to carry out the observational test , one canreformulate the definition of @xmath84 slightly by reevaluating the integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ m_t ] ) and ( [ m_p ] ) with the upper limit @xmath146 set to the high energy end of the bin .",
    "alternatively one may collectively bin all photons with energy @xmath145 for successively increasing values of @xmath63 . for simplicity",
    ", we perform the latter procedure , assuming energy bins with @xmath63 taken in @xmath147kev increments from @xmath31kev up to @xmath1kev . for all bins , @xmath148 .",
    "the results are shown in table [ bintable ] .",
    "the range of pulse strengths predicted for energy bins in observations of a single flare is very strongly dependent on the difference @xmath149 . even in the case of @xmath150 , a large range of pulse strengths",
    "is expected @xmath151 .",
    "this effect can be measured , and can be used to test the shock reprocessing model and constrain @xmath70 , even for moderately small values of @xmath37 .",
    ".pulse strengths @xmath84 for increasing energy bins and a range of @xmath70 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     furthermore , the strong pulses at high energies are consistent with the soft - hard - soft ( shs ) spectral pattern observed in many flare spectra , even down to subsecond time scales @xcite . typically , the shs pattern traces total luminosity . as flare emission cycles through pulses , the spectrum starts out soft at the low luminosity onset of the pulse , steadily increases up to a maximal hardness at the pulse peak , then decays back to a softer spectrum as the luminosity returns to the pre - pulse minimum .",
    "the shock reprocessing model generates pulses via strengthening of the shock compression , which corresponds to hardening of the reprocessed spectrum , as illustrated in table [ bintable ] .",
    "small changes in the super - magnetosonic mach number of weakly compressive shocks can produce significant changes in the compression ratio . for pulse strengths in excess of @xmath112",
    ", the footpoint x - ray spectrum will have index @xmath152 , the shock spectral index , since the emission will be dominated by the reprocessed population . as the pulse progresses toward the peak luminosity , the shock compression ratio peaks as well , and so does the spectral hardness . during the decay phase ,",
    "the shock compression decreases , and the spectrum softens , resulting in a shs pattern .",
    "moderate pulses , especially those with large @xmath37 will still produce a weak shs pattern simply due to the large number of reprocessed electrons .",
    "reconnection can be thought of as an environment for particle acceleration . within the reconnection region and ensuing outflows , a combination of acceleration mechanisms",
    "may operate .",
    "we have proposed the shock reprocessing model as one scenario of interest for solar flares when the downflows form reconnection sites are turbulent .",
    "\\(1 ) the model posits a two stage acceleration process : stfa in a turbulent reconnection downflow followed by first order acceleration at a loop - top fast shock .",
    "hard x - ray emission sources are predicted in the stfa region , as well as at the foot - points .",
    "\\(2 ) pulsed emission is produced by variations in the compression ratio of the fast shock , and thus in the post - shock electron spectrum .",
    "the shock does not fill the entire cross section of the downflow , and is weakly compressive .",
    "it is seen that relative pulse strengths produced within the shock reprocessing model are reasonable for realistic values of the local plasma parameters , and a simple model of shock formation .",
    "furthermore , the generation of pulses at the shock predicts that the above the loop - top source does not exhibit the subsecond pulse structure observed at footpoints .",
    "\\(3 ) both the fast ( pulse ) and slow ( smooth ) time delay measurements @xcite can be explained within the shock reprocessing model .",
    "the fast time delays in the pulsed component are time of flight dispersion of the shock accelerated electrons .",
    "the slow time delays in the smooth component reflect the stfa acceleration rate .",
    "\\(4 ) the shock reprocessing model predicts an increase in relative pulse strength at higher energies .",
    "this prediction remains to be tested , and can distinguish between the shock reprocessing and trap precipitation models .",
    "the shock reprocessing model is not meant to be an exclusive solution to electron acceleration in all solar flares .",
    "it seems unlikely that the wide variety of flare phenomena can be explained if all reconnection regions have the same relative contributions for the combination of acceleration processes that can ensue .",
    "generic features such magnetic reconnection , soft x - ray loops , and footpoint hard x - rays , do appear to be common to the vast majority of flares . however , other phenomena are not : coronal x - ray emission sources appear sometimes with thermal and other times with non - thermal spectral characteristics , sometimes above the soft x - ray loop , or sometimes within it , and other times not at all .",
    "the reconnection morphology , while apparantly similar in any 2-d snapshot along the plane of the soft x - ray loops , can have either vertical ( standard ) or lateral ( `` zipper '' ) dynamical evolution .",
    "one particularly difficult observation to explain within the shock reprocessing model is the appearance , in a small number of flares , of coronal hard x - ray emission emanating from within the closed soft x - ray loop @xcite .",
    "these sources are non - thermal , and hard x - ray emission in the flares is dominated by the coronal , not footpoint sources .",
    "one might suspect such a source to be produced within the trap - precipitation model in the presence of an abnormally dense loop ; the trapped electron population within the loop would emit via thick target bremsstrahlung .",
    "conversely , the shock reprocessing model does not load the electron beam onto the closed flare loop , and thus can not produce these sources .",
    "this class of loop - top emission has only been observed in a few events .",
    "as the total number of coronal sources within loops grows , it would be of great interest to determine which , if any , environemntal parameters such as laminar vs. turbulent downflows correlate with the location of the coronal source .",
    "the phenomenological array of flares can likely be understood by a relatively small number of acceleration scenarios which each operate within the basic paradigm of magnetic reconnection and outflow .",
    "the power source driving all flares is reconnection high in the corona , which launches a downflow . within the outflow ,",
    "particle acceleration occurs , followed by x - ray , gamma ray , and radio emission in the lower corona and chromosphere .",
    "the particular acceleration scenario is determined by local environmental parameters in the reconnection , downflow , and emission regions .",
    "shock reprocessing and trap precipitation are two such scenarios within this framework .",
    "a third scenario seems to required to explain proton dominated flares @xcite .    in summary : the shock reprocessing model , whereby a fraction of stochastically accelerated electrons also passes through a weakly compressive stationary shock as they stream toward chromospheric footpoints , provides a scenario for explaining a variety of features in impulsive solar flares within the more general reconnection and outflow framework .",
    "the model produces pulsed and smooth spectral x - ray emission components consistent with the time delay observations of @xcite .",
    "shock reprocessing also predicts the appearance of above the loop - top coronal emission sites observed in a fraction of flares .",
    "furthermore , the model makes a sequence of testable predictions regarding the pulse strength as a function of energy and the shs emission pattern .",
