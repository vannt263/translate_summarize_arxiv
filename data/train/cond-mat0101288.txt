    "the conductivity sum rule is one of the most useful methods to analyze optical properties of high-@xmath3 cuprates .",
    "the conventional sum rule@xcite states that the missing spectral weight @xmath4 under the real part of the optical conductivity between superconducting and normal state is equal to the superfluid density @xmath5 .",
    "however , violations of the conventional sum rule along the @xmath0-axis have been observed@xcite in some high-@xmath3 cuprates , and are related to the change in kinetic energy @xcite on entering the superconducting state . since @xmath0-axis response reflects in - plane dynamics,@xcite the @xmath0-axis conductivity sum rule and the corresponding superfluid density are worthwhile investigating to understand characteristics of cuo@xmath1 planes as well as for their own importance and interest .",
    "we have previously studied@xcite effects of an in - plane magnetic field on the @xmath0-axis sum rule and on the superfluid density under the assumption that the in - plane field freely penetrates between cuo@xmath1 planes , and found that such a field could not easily change the @xmath0-axis sum rule .",
    "the reason for this is that the in - plane field is not directly pair breaking and it is only the induced vortex due to josephson tunneling that reduces the superfluid density .",
    "usually the conductivity sum rule is not changed by a perturbation since the c - axis kinetic energy remains unchanged in many cases . in some notion of interlayer coupling theory ,",
    "superconductivity is related to the kinetic energy ; namely , it might be kinetic energy - driven.@xcite in this respect the changes in the kinetic energy and in the c - axis sum rule suggest fundamental information on superconductivity .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-axis magnetic field is more interesting because it gives rise to a shift in the quasiparticle energy spectrum , and serves as a direct pair breaker .",
    "when a @xmath0-axis magnetic field @xmath6 is above @xmath7 and below @xmath8 in a magnitude , where @xmath9 is the lower ( upper ) critical field , and the anisotropy of the dirac cone @xmath10 is much larger than one , where @xmath11 is the fermi ( gap ) velocity , the semiclassical approach@xcite can be applied . since @xmath12 , vortices are still well separated and it is an extended quasiparticle state that dominately determines the properties of the in - plane dynamics for a @xmath13-wave superconductor . for @xmath14 , quantum mechanical effect becomes important;@xcite however , this is not the case for the high-@xmath3 cuprates , for which @xmath15 .    in this paper",
    "we consider the effect of a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the cuo@xmath1 planes on the @xmath0-axis sum rule and on the corresponding superfluid density .",
    "we apply a semiclassical approximation to a vortex state in a two dimensional @xmath13-wave superconductor for @xmath12 and @xmath15 , and include in the calculation only the energy shift due to the circulating supercurrents around the vortex cores .",
    "we assume that the core occupies only a small part of the single vortex unit cell , and that it is the energy shift of the quasiparticles outside the cores that is most important .",
    "we study both the the case of correlated and uncorrelated pancake vortices , and find that the @xmath0-axis sum rule depends on the interlayer correlation of pancake vortices while details of the intralayer vortex distribution is less significant .",
    "we begin with the hamiltonian @xmath16 , where @xmath17 describes a @xmath13-wave superconductivity , and @xmath18 $ ] is interlayer coupling;@xcite therefore , an electron transfers from a site @xmath19 in plane 1 to the same site @xmath19 in plane 2 . in the semiclassical approximation",
    ", a quasiparticle sitting on the supercurrent circulating around a votex has an energy shift , the so - called doppler shift , and the magnitude of the supercurrent is inversely proportional to the distance from the center of the vortex . as illustrated in fig1 .",
    "( a ) , for the correlated vortex state a quasiparticle sitting on , say , the slow supercurrent transfers to the next plane without change in momentum and , therefore , still sits on the slow supercurrent loop as before .",
    "consequently , we expect that the kinetic energy will not change during the interlayer hopping .",
    "note that the @xmath0-axis physics is determined by the in - plane dynamics as we pointed out earlier [ see also eq .",
    "( [ kinetic_e ] ) ] . on the other hand , for the uncorrelated vortex state , fig1 .",
    "( b ) , a quasiparticle on the slow supercurrent loop sits on the fast supercurrent after hopping ; therefore , the kinetic energy changes .",
    "the detailed calculation requires the in - plane distribution of pancake vortices and it will be explained later .",
    "the optical conductivity follows from the appropriate kubo formula : _",
    "c()=(i/ ) where @xmath20 is the analytic continuation for the current - current correlation in matsubara representation , and @xmath21 represents the thermal average of the @xmath0-axis kinetic energy . here",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath13 are the electron charge and the interlayer spacing , respectively .",
    "the superfluid density is detrermined by kramers - kronig relation : @xmath23 $ ] . in terms of the real part of the conductivity @xmath24 ,",
    "the @xmath0-axis conductivity sum rule reads : _ s = n -4e^2d , where @xmath25 $ ] , and the superscripts @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the normal and superconducting state , respectively . in the integral defining @xmath4 , the upper limit is sufficiently large so as to include all optical transitions of importance to the problem but not interband effects .",
    "the kinetic energy change @xmath28 $ ] will be denoted as @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath6 , the sum rule becomes @xmath30 , and it can be written as 1+k(0)_s(0 ) + k_s_s(0 ) [ sumh ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "as can be easily seen , the sum rule change due to the field depends not only on @xmath33 but also on @xmath34 .",
    "it is easy to understand that the @xmath0-axis magnetic field has no effect on the interlayer hopping for a fermi liquid in the overdoped regime while the absence of a well - established theory of the pseudogap state would seemingly cause ambiguity in the validity of our approachi for the pseudogap regime .",
    "however , recently it has been observed@xcite that the pseudogap is insensitive to the magnetic field .",
    "this implies that even for the underdoped cuprates , a semiclassical approach may be applicable to the sum rule calculation and the kinetic energy change is determined only by the field effect on the superconducting state ; namely , the doppler shift . here , we would like to emphasize that we do not calculate the zero field kinetic energy difference @xmath35 for the pseudogap state because a model for the pseudogap would be required to do so ; instead , we base our analysis on experimental observations@xcite for this case .",
    "we also point out that effects of the doppler shift are considered only on the superconducting state not on the pseudogap state .",
    "@xcite    let us first calculate the kinetic energy change @xmath33 . in the semicalssical approximation ,",
    "the fermionic matsubara frequencies @xmath36 in the superconducting @xmath37 green function @xmath38 are shifted by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the superfluid velocity at @xmath41 in a plane and @xmath42 the quasiparticle momentum , that is , the @xmath37 green function in nambu space is @xmath43 , and an average over the vortex unit cell is to be carried out . denoting @xmath44 ,",

    "the total kinetic energy is obtained after @xmath53 is appropriately averaged over a vortex unit cell of radius @xmath54 @xmath55 with @xmath56 the area of the unit cell . actually , the correct averaging procedure depends on whether or not the pancake vortices from one plane to the next are correlated or are completely uncorrelated . for the correlated case @xmath57 and",
    "there is a simple space average over @xmath41 while in the uncorrelated case we need to introduce two separate uncorrelated space variable @xmath58 and @xmath59 and take independent averages over @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "we consider the case of uncorrelated pancakes distributed randomly in each plane so that @xmath63 and @xmath64 are to be averaged independently and separately . in a @xmath13-wave superconductor",
    "it is the nodal quasiparticles that dominate the low @xmath65 or the small @xmath66 response .",
    "we take @xmath67 and work with the difference in kinetic energy with field on and off @xmath68 . note",
    "that this quantity is determined only by the field effect on the superconducting state in our consideration .",
    "we then apply a nodal approximation . in carrying out the sum over @xmath42",
    "we make a coordinate transformation to @xmath69 with the nodal point @xmath70 on the fermi surface playing the role of the origin for @xmath69 .",
    "we then integrate over a nodal region and the integration over @xmath69 should not be sensitive to the region of integration provided @xmath71 is taken to be of order @xmath72 . with these simplification we can introduce a @xmath73-function @xmath74 into the expression for @xmath75 and define ( _ 1)=1ad*r*_1 ( _ 1-*v*_s1(*r*_1)_n ) , to obtain k_s(h)-k_s(0)=&&^_-d_1d_2 p(_1)p(_2 ) + & & , [ ke_un ] where @xmath76 . the matrix sum in @xmath77 can be done to get ( _ 1,_2)=&&c2 t _ * k*__n , with @xmath78 and @xmath79 the superconducting state ordinary and anomalous amplitude , respectively . for simplicity",
