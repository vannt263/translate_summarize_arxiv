    "a new concept ,  bushes of normal modes \" , was introduced for nonlinear mechanical systems with discrete symmetry in  @xcite .",
    "a given bush represents a certain superposition of the modes associated with different irreducible representations ( irreps ) of the symmetry group  @xmath1 of the mechanical system in equilibrium .",
    "the coefficients of this superposition are time - dependent functions for which the exact ordinary differential equations can be obtained . in this sense",
    ", the bush can be considered as a dynamical object whose dimensionality is generally less than that of the original mechanical system .",
    "the following propositions were justified in previous papers  @xcite :    1 .",
    "a certain subgroup @xmath2 of the symmetry group @xmath1 corresponds to a given bush , and this bush can be excited by imposing the appropriate initial conditions with the above symmetry group @xmath3 .",
    "each mode belonging to the bush possesses its own symmetry group which is greater than or equal to the group @xmath2 of the whole bush .",
    "3 .   in spite of evolving mode amplitudes ,",
    "the complete collection of modes in the given bush is preserved in time and , in this sense , the bush can be considered as a geometrical object .",
    "the energy of the initial excitation is trapped in the bush , i.e. it can not spread to the modes which do not belong to the bush , because of the symmetry restrictions .",
    "5 .   as an indivisible nonlinear object ,",
    "the bush exists because of force interactions between the modes contained in it .",
    "6 .   taking into account the concrete type of interactions between particles of the considered mechanical system",
    "can only reduce the dimension of the given bush . 7 .",
    "the extension of the bush can be realized as a result of the loss of its stability which is accompanied by spontaneous breaking of the bush symmetry ( dynamical analog of phase transition ) .",
    "the special group - theoretical methods for finding bushes of modes are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the computer implementation of these methods  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) allowed us to find bushes of modes for wide classes of mechanical systems with discrete symmetry .",
    "in particular ,  irreducible \" bushes of vibrational modes and symmetry determined similar non - linear normal modes for all n - particle mechanical systems with the symmetry of any of the 230 space groups were found in  @xcite .",
    "the bushes of vibrational modes of small dimensions were found and classified into universality classes for all mechanical systems with point groups of crystallographic symmetry in  @xcite .    unlike discussions of existence of bushes of modes , a few papers were devoted to the problem of their stability ( as an example",
    ", we can refer to the investigation of bushes of vibrational modes for fpu-@xmath4 chains in  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the problem of stability is one of the most important for bush theory .",
    "indeed , we must keep in mind that bushes of modes can be considered as new physical objects only in the case where they are stable in the _ finite _ domains of pertinent parameters of the appropriate dynamical systems .",
    "the problem of existence of bushes of modes can be studied with the aid of the group - theoretical methods only , and appropriate results do not depend on the concrete type of interactions between particles of our mechanical system .",
    "in contrast , studying of bush stability depends on these interactions essentially .    in the present paper , after the outline of the bush theory in sec.2 , we consider bushes of vibrational modes for an octahedral mechanical system of mass particles depicted in fig .  [ fig.1 ] , with or without a particle in the center of the octahedron .",
    "all bushes of modes are presented in sec.3 .",
    "the differential equations describing their dynamics are discussed in sec.4 .",
    "the stability of the bushes of vibrational modes is investigated in sec.5 for the case of interactions between particles described by the lennard - jones potential .",
    "a detailed consideration of the theory of bushes of modes with some theorems about their structure and with the appropriate group - theoretical methods can be found in  @xcite .",
    "an extensive description of the computational algorithm for finding bushes in arbitrary crystal structures is presented in  @xcite .",
    "let us now give an outline of the bush theory with emphasis on the ideas important for our further discussion .",
    "we consider classical hamiltonian systems of @xmath0 mass points moving near a single equilibrium state which can be characterized by a certain point or space symmetry group @xmath1 .",
    "let the @xmath5-dimensional vector , @xmath6 describe the displacements @xmath7 of all particles of our mechanical system from their equilibrium positions .",
    "( here we denote by the three - dimensional vector @xmath8 the displacement of the @xmath9-th particle along the @xmath10 and @xmath11 axes ) .",
    "the vector @xmath12 can be written as a superposition of all basis vectors @xmath13 of the irreducible representations @xmath14 of the above mentioned symmetry group @xmath1 : @xmath15 the coefficients @xmath16 of this superposition depend on time @xmath17 , while the @xmath5-dimensional time - independent vectors @xmath18 determine the specific patterns of displacements of all particles of our mechanical system .",
    "note that the basis vectors @xmath18 are often called  symmetry - adapted coordinates \" .",
    "in particular , they can be normal coordinates .",
    "hereafter , the term ,  mode \" , means an arbitrary superposition of basis vectors corresponding to a given irrep @xmath14 . as a result of this definition , every term @xmath19 in the right - hand side of eq.([eq2 ] )",
    "is also a mode of the irrep @xmath14 .",
    "sometimes , for brevity , we will refer to @xmath16 as a mode , but",
    "a reader must imagine that this time - dependent coefficient is multiplied by the appropriate @xmath5-dimensional vector @xmath18 to give the mode in the exact sense .",
    "we can also speak about _ vibrational _ modes because only such type of symmetry - adapted ( normal ) modes are considered in the present paper .    every dynamical regime of the considered mechanical system can be described by the appropriate time - dependent vector @xmath12 which determines a definite instantaneous configuration of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "each instantaneous configuration possesses a certain symmetry group @xmath2 ( in particular , this group may be trivial : @xmath20 ) which is a subgroup of the symmetry group @xmath1 of the system in equilibrium ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "moreover , we can also ascribe a certain symmetry group to each basis vector @xmath18 and to each mode corresponding to a given irrep @xmath14 ( remember that a mode is a superposition of such vectors ! ) , because the definite instantaneous configurations correspond to them .",
    "the group @xmath2 contains all symmetry elements of group @xmath1 whose action does not change this configuration .",
    "let us introduce , as it is usual in group theory , the operators @xmath22 associated with elements @xmath23 of group @xmath1 ( @xmath24 ) which act on @xmath5-dimensional vectors @xmath25 .",
    "act on the vectors of three - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "] all elements @xmath24 for which @xmath26 form a certain subgroup @xmath21 , and a complete set of the above operators @xmath22 ( @xmath27 ) represents the group @xmath28 .",
    "it can be shown that the symmetry group @xmath2 is preserved in time in the sense that its elements _ can not disappear _ during time evolution . actually , this property is a consequence of the principle of determinism in classical mechanics .",
    "thus , the equation @xmath29 @xmath30 , or , formally , @xmath31 is valid for every time @xmath17 . as a consequence",
    ", we can classify the different dynamical regimes in our nonlinear dynamical system , described by the vectors @xmath12 from eqs.([eq1],[eq2 ] ) , with the aid of _ symmetry groups _ corresponding to them .    using eq.([eq4 ] ) , we can obtain the similar _ invariance conditions _ for each individual irrep @xmath14 of the group @xmath1 ( see details in  @xcite ) : @xmath32 here @xmath33 is a restriction of the irrep @xmath14 to the subgroup @xmath2 of the group @xmath1 , and @xmath34 is an _ invariant vector _ of @xmath14 ( @xmath35 is the dimension of this irrep ) .    to find all modes contributing to a given dynamical regime with symmetry group @xmath2 , i.e. , for the vector @xmath12 from eq.([eq2 ] ) , we must solve linear algebraic equations  ( [ eq5 ] ) for each irrep @xmath14 of the group @xmath1 . as a result of this procedure , the invariant vector @xmath36 for some irreps @xmath14 can turn out to be equal to zero .",
    "such irreps do not contribute to the considered dynamical regime .",
    "on the other hand , some nonzero invariant vectors @xmath36 for multidimensional irreps may be of a very specific form because of definite relations between their components ( for example , certain components can be equal to each other , or differ only by sign ) . the contributions to @xmath12 from such irreps @xmath14 possess special forms . in tables",
    "[ 2a ] ,  [ 2b ] , we find , for instance , dynamical regimes for which the contributions from the irrep @xmath37 of the group @xmath38 are of the forms @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] .",

    "its modes interact with other modes which do not belong to @xmath263 $ ] , but these interactions must be of parametric ( not force ! ) type only ( see sec.[dynamical aspects ] ) . for the appropriate initial conditions we can get into a region of unstable movement . as a result , some new modes are excited which were forbidden by the principle of determinism of classical mechanics",
    ". then we can speak about the loss of stability of the original bush @xmath263 $ ] and its transformation into a larger bush @xmath265 $ ] with @xmath268 .",
    "it was found from numerical experiments that the boundaries of stable ( unstable ) domains for bushes of vibrational modes depend not only on the initial energy @xmath264 , but on the _ way _ of excitation , as well . because of this reason , we will _ fix _ the way of initial excitation .",
    "let us first discuss the loss of stability of the bushes from table  [ 2a ] .",
    "the root mode of each of these bushes is determined by a _",
    "single _ time - dependent coefficient @xmath16 whose initial value at @xmath56 we will denote by the symbol @xmath269 @xmath270 .",
    "at the initial instant @xmath56 , we fix the coordinates of all particles of the mechanical system in such a way that their _ displacements _ correspond to the appropriate root mode with amplitude @xmath269 , while their velocities are equal to _ zero_. namely this choice of initial conditions determines the above mentioned _ way _ of excitation of a given bush .    using these initial conditions",
    "we solve numerically the exact dynamical equations of the considered mechanical system with 18 degrees of freedom , and analyze the set of nonzero modes @xmath16 in the decomposition ( [ eq2 ] ) of the vector @xmath12 obtained as a result of this solving .",
    "then we gradually increase the value @xmath269 and repeat the procedure just described until the number of nonzero modes @xmath16 , at some value @xmath271 , becomes larger than that of the bush @xmath263 $ ] .",
    "we will refer to @xmath272 as the _ threshold _ of stability of the given bush .",
    "obviously , in such a way we obtain the upper boundary of the first stability region of @xmath263 $ ] in the one - dimensional space of all possible values @xmath273.$ ] in the present paper . ]",
    "the threshold values @xmath272 , with the appropriate numerical accuracy , for different bushes for the octahedral structure without a centered particle can be found in the last column of table  [ 2a ] .",
    "for example , the threshold @xmath274 corresponds to bush @xmath122 $ ] .",
    "it means that below this threshold only three nonzero modes can be revealed in the decomposition of the appropriate vector @xmath275 ( root mode ) and @xmath276 ( secondary modes ) , while beyond this value of @xmath272 some new modes @xmath16 appear in the decomposition ( [ eq2 ] ) of the vector @xmath12 .",
    "we treat this fact as evidence of the loss of stability of bush @xmath122 $ ] and its transformation to a new bush of higher dimension .",
    "note that in the present paper , we do not determine what this new bush is , because realization of such a goal requires a sufficient time due to some computational errors problems .",
    "we already discussed the bush @xmath146 $ ] from table  [ 2a ] which can be excited either by an initial excitation of the root mode @xmath277 of the irrep @xmath124 with the amplitude @xmath278 , or by excitation of the root mode @xmath279 of the irrep @xmath37 with the amplitude @xmath280 .",
    "in such cases , we find _ two _ different threshold values @xmath281 and @xmath282 corresponding to the two different root modes .",
    "a more complicated computational problem arises when we analyze the domains of stability for some bushes of modes from table  [ 2b ] .",
    "indeed , the root modes of bushes @xmath283 $ ] , @xmath284 $ ] , @xmath285 $ ] , @xmath286 $ ] , @xmath287 $ ] , @xmath288 $ ] , @xmath289 $ ] , include _ two _ independent functions @xmath16 . for some of the above bushes these functions are associated with basis vectors of one and the same irrep ; in other cases they are associated with basis vectors of two different irreps .",
    "therefore , we must now study the boundary of the stability domain in a two - dimensional space of initial values , say , @xmath290 and @xmath291 , of the two appropriate time - dependent variables @xmath16 . since studying of the form of such a boundary , by means of numerical experiments , requires a lot of computational time ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the determination of only the radius @xmath292 of a circle which with assurance lies in the stability domain .",
    "namely these radii we give in the last column of table  [ 2b ] as certain estimation characteristics of stability domains of the appropriate bushes of vibrational modes .    in table",
    "[ 2b ] , as well as in table  [ 2a ] , we encounter the case where a given bush can be excited by using different choices of the root mode , but now each of these modes is determined by two amplitudes @xmath16 .",
    "this is the bush @xmath293 $ ] whose root modes are @xmath294 or @xmath295 .",
    "because of this reason , two different radii @xmath296 and @xmath297 are given in table  [ 2b ] corresponded to the above two variants of the root mode .",
    "finally , the root mode of the last bush @xmath298 $ ] in table  [ 2b ] depends on three functions @xmath299 and , therefore , we must study , in this case , the boundary of the stability domain in three - dimensional space .",
    "we give for this bush the radius @xmath300 of a sphere which with certainty belongs to the stability domain .      up to this point our consideration was based on group - theoretical methods which are independent of the type of interactions between particles in the mechanical system .",
    "now we intend to discuss the findings on bush stability using for this purpose the concrete type of interactions described by the lennard - jones potential already discussed in sec .",
    "[ exact ] ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) ) .",
    "first of all , we must examine the stability of the octahedral structure depicted in fig.1 in the equilibrium state .",
    "to this end , we found squares of all eigenfrequencies in the harmonic approximation with the aid of the maple package and made their classification in accordance with the irreps of the group @xmath38 .",

    "the irreps @xmath305 and @xmath85 are not contained in the decomposition of the full vibrational representation @xmath83 of the octahedral structure and , as a consequence , there are no vibrational frequencies corresponding to them .",
    "note , @xmath306 $ ] and the last value of @xmath307 $ ] are equal to zero .",
    "they correspond , respectively , to pure rotation and pure translation of the mechanical system as a whole , and must be excluded from the further discussion because we consider vibrational regimes only .",
    "all other @xmath304 $ ] are _ positive _ and this proves that the equilibrium state of our mechanical system is stable .",
    "let us also write down the value @xmath186 of the edge of the regular octahedron depicted in fig.[fig.1 ] in equilibrium : @xmath308 hereafter , we use such dimensionless units that @xmath309 and @xmath310 in the formula ( [ eq10 ] ) for the lennard - jones potential ( see sec .  [ exact ] ) .",
    "now we consider our results on the stability of dynamical regimes described by bushes of vibrational modes .",
    "the computational scheme , outlined in the previous section , and fourth order runge - kutta method were used for appropriate numerical experiments .",
    "the threshold values @xmath311 characterizing the size of stability domains for all bushes are given in the last column of tables  [ 2a ] ,  [ 2b ] .",
    "it can be seen from these tables that the size of stability domains differs very considerably for different bushes : @xmath312 .    the one - dimensional bush @xmath227 $ ] , consisting of the breathing mode only , possesses the minimal  stability reserve \" : @xmath313 .",
    "obviously , this is a very small value for @xmath272 , because the displacements of particles corresponding to it are approximately equal to 0.0005 , while the equilibrium edge @xmath186 of our octahedron is equal to 1.117 according to eq.([101 ] ) .",
    "thus , the bush @xmath227 $ ] exhibits very weak stability for the octahedral structure without a centered particle .",
    "nevertheless , if a particle in the center of the octahedron depicted in fig.[fig.1 ] is present , the threshold value @xmath272 for this bush can be up to 1001000 times greater , depending on the force properties of the centered particle ( see sec .",
    "[ seq5.4 ] ) .",
    "the maximal value @xmath272 corresponds to the bush @xmath140 \\ ; ( r=0.078)$ ] , demonstrating how strong can be the difference between the stability properties of dynamical regimes with different character of displacements of individual particles ( note that using tables  [ 2a ] ,  [ 2b ] ,  [ 1 ] , we can imagine the character of movement of the mechanical system for any given bush ) .",
    "our main result can be formulated as follows : _ all _ bushes of vibrational modes possess stability domains of a _ finite size _ for the octahedral structure with the lennard - jones potential .      in many physical papers ,",
    "pair interactions between modes are discussed ( compare the phonon - phonon interactions in the presence of anharmonic terms in the appropriate hamiltonian ) . in a rigorous sense ,",
    "such a setting of the problem is incorrect and can be used only as a first step of investigation , for example , to obtain some estimations .",
    "indeed , we can formally write the lagrange equations describing dynamics of only two arbitrarily chosen modes , but this new two - dimensional dynamical system may not correspond to any real dynamical regime in the original mechanical system .    the importance of the bush theory is brought about , above all , by the following consequence : choosing a given bush , we can guarantee that the full collection of its modes is _ closed _",
    "i.e. that the appropriate dynamical regime including _ only these _ modes _ can really exist _ in the considered mechanical system . as a consequence ,",
    "the lagrange equations , obtained for the complete set of the modes of a given bush , are exact .",
    "nevertheless , studying the interactions between pairs of different normal modes may be useful in certain cases as an approximate method for revealing some essential properties of nonlinear dynamics of the mechanical system .",
    "let us illustrate this idea using the following examples .",

    "] , belonging to the irreps @xmath314 and @xmath86 , brought about by their _ pair interactions _ with the breathing mode @xmath127 . in other words",
    ", we must find the threshold values @xmath315 beyond which each of these previously sleeping modes can appear because of its interaction with the  active \" mode @xmath316 .",

    "it is essential , that when we find this value @xmath272 for @xmath227 $ ] by means of the numerical procedure described in sec.[set_prob ] , we can not reveal the _ cause _ of such a small value of @xmath272 .",
    "now we can assert that the bush @xmath227 $ ] loses its stability because of the interactions with the modes namely of the irrep @xmath124 and , therefore , this bush must transform into a certain bush , containing these modes , such as @xmath122 , b6[c'_{2v}]$ ] , etc . , but not into such bushes as @xmath119 , b4[c_{2v}]$ ] , etc .",
    "let us discuss the threshold value @xmath323 of the stability of the bush @xmath119 $ ] ( see table  [ 2a ] ) in terms of pair interactions between different modes .",

    "( there is one and only one mode  @xmath127  which is brought into the vibrational process by _ force _ originating from the active mode @xmath128 . )",
    "we obtained the following results : @xmath325,\\ ] ] @xmath326,\\ ] ] @xmath327,\\ ] ] @xmath328.\\ ] ]    note that unlike the case where the breathing mode was active ( see eq.([102 ] ) ) , threshold values @xmath321 for the excitation of sleeping modes by the active mode @xmath128 can be _ different _ for the different modes of one and the same multidimensional irrep .",
    "a remarkable fact can be revealed in analyzing the above threshold values given in eq.([103 ] ) .",
    "indeed , all @xmath321 , corresponding to the initial value of the root mode @xmath128 , are _ essentially greater _ than the threshold @xmath323 for the loss of stability of the considered bush @xmath119 $ ] . on the other hand , as we already know , the threshold for the parametric excitation of the modes associated with the irrep @xmath124 by action from the active mode @xmath127 is a very small value : @xmath329 .",
    "this fact suggests that the sufficiently weak stability of the bush @xmath119 $ ] brought about by the parametric excitation of some sleeping modes originated not from the root , but from the _ secondary _ mode of our bush ! indeed ,",
    "if we consider dynamics of the bush @xmath119 $ ] when @xmath330 are slightly higher than 0.009 , the value of its secondary mode @xmath127 does reach the threshold value 0.001 which can lead to excitation of the modes of the irreps @xmath124 .    thus , we encounter now the case where a given bush loses its stability because of the phenomenon similar to the parametric resonance induced by its _",
    "secondary _ mode , and this property demonstrates , in particular , that a bush is an indivisible dynamical object .",
    "first of all , let us note that all octahedral molecules , known to us at the present time , possess an atom in the center of the octahedron ( see fig.[fig.1 ] ) .",
    "this fact suggests that the stability of such structures can be greater than that of the mechanical system considered in the previous sections .",
    "taking into account this hint , we examined bush stability for the mechanical structure depicted in fig.[fig.1 ] , supposing that the particle in the center of the octahedron is described by the lennard - jones potential _ different _ from that of six peripheral particles .",
    "let us assume that the lennard - jones potential of the form @xmath331 with @xmath332 corresponds to the centered particle , while all other particles are described by the potential ( [ 150 ] ) with @xmath310 .",
    "such an assumption provides us a possibility to make the attractive part of the potential of the centered particle greater than that of peripheral atoms in spite of the same repulsive part .",
    "we will consider only several bushes of modes for the centered structure to show that the size of the stability domain can be increased essentially by means of the appropriate choice of the value b. note for the beginning of the discussion , that all bushes from tables  [ 2a],[2b ] are relevant bushes for centered structure , as well as for that without the particle in the center of the octahedron , if this particle is fixed .",
    ",  [ 2b ] . ]",
    "let us discuss some results of the appropriate numerical experiments .",
    "the boundary of the stability domain for the bush @xmath227 $ ] can be increased from the threshold value @xmath313 ( see table  [ 2a ] ) up to the value @xmath333 for the case of the centered structure with @xmath334 .",
    "( it is interesting that the function @xmath335 for this bush is not monotonic ) .",
    "the threshold values @xmath272 for other considered bushes also become larger for @xmath334 in comparison with those for @xmath310 . for example",

    "note that the dependence of the boundary @xmath272 of stability domains on the value @xmath189 is essentially different for different bushes .",
    "we can conclude that the stability of bushes of vibrational modes for the centered structure can be increased , and for some bushes substantially increased , in comparison to that of the mechanical system without the centered particle on account of the appropriate choice of the constant @xmath189 in the lennard - jones potential ( [ 150 ] ) .",
    "the specific dynamical objects  _ bushes of normal modes _  whose theory was developed in @xcite , are discussed in the present paper for octahedral mechanical systems with point masses .",
    "being a certain collection of modes , a given bush possesses some symmetry group which is a subgroup of the symmetry group of the mechanical system in equilibrium .",

    "the main results are listed in tables [ 2a ] and [ 2b ] .",
    "it was proved that all of the above mentioned bushes possess stability domains of _ finite size _ and , therefore , they really can be treated as certain physical objects .",

    "the minimal number of generators for group @xmath38 is equal 2 , but it is more convenient , for our purpose , to use an extended set of generators . in notation of the handbook by kovalev  @xcite , we chose the following five generators : @xmath339 . here @xmath340 and @xmath106 are @xmath341 rotations about the two - fold axes [ 100 ] , [ 010 ] and [ @xmath34210 ] , respectively ; @xmath343 is a @xmath344 rotation about the three - fold axis [ 111 ] , and @xmath345 is the inversion . using these generators we can obtain , step by step , the following chain of groups : @xmath346\\to d_2[h_2 , h_3]\\to t[h_2 , h_3 , h_5]\\to o[h_2 , h_3 , h_5 , h_{13}]\\to o_h$ ] .",
