    "in the range of primary energies of @xmath0 ev per nucleus , direct methods for studying the energy spectrum and nuclear composition of primary cosmic rays become inefficient because of a decrease in the flux of primary particles with an increase in their energy . therefore , at these and , of course , higher energies , indirect methods based on simultaneous measurement of the characteristics of different components of extensive air showers ( eass ) , which are initiated by the primary particle in the atmosphere , are used . but the interpretation of these measurements requires their comparison with eas simulations in the atmosphere . in turn , the calculation results depend on the hadronic interaction models .",
    "the main problem is the extrapolation of these models into kinematical and energy regions still unexplored by present - day collider experiments .",
    "so , the measurements of different eas components are now used for both studying the primary composition and testing interaction models @xcite - @xcite .    in this paper three types of experimental data",
    "are analyzed : muon number spectrum , eas size spectrum and correlation between muon number and eas size simultaneously measured .",
    "integral muon number spectrum has been measured using the baksan underground scintillation telescope ( bust ) @xcite .",
    "the eas size spectrum has been measured using the `` andyrchy '' eas array @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the mean number of high energy muons on eas size has been measured by simultaneous operation of both devices @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the `` andyrchy '' eas array is located on the slope of the andyrchy mountain above bust ( 43.3@xmath1 n , 42.7@xmath1 e ) and consists of 37 plastic scintillation detectors .",
    "a plastic scintillator of the 5 cm thickness has an area of @xmath2 and is viewed with a single pmt .",
    "the detectors are designed for both timing measurements ( for eas arrival direction ) and evaluation of primary energy ( via eas core localization and determination of total number of particles in shower ) .",
    "the distance between the detectors is about 40 m in projection to the horizontal plane and the overall area of the installation is @xmath3 m@xmath4 ; the solid angle at which the array is viewed from the bust is 0.35 sr .",
    "the central detectorof the array is above the bust s center at a vertical distance of about 360 m and at 2060 m above the sea level .",
    "the difference between the heights of the upper and lower rows of detectors is @xmath5150 m. + the energy deposition measurement is performed in natural units , so called relativistic particles . one relativistic particle ( r.p .",
    ") is the most probable energy deposition from a single cosmic ray particle . for our detector",
    "it is 10.6 mev @xcite .",
    "the range of the energy deposition measurements is from 0.5 r.p .",
    "( the threshold of the charge - to - time converter ) up to more than 1000 r.p .",
    "+ trigger formation and all measurements are performed in a registration room , which is placed near the center of the array ( length of connection cables is up to 280 m ) .",
    "the shower trigger condition requires signals from 4 detectors within 3 microseconds .",
    "the trigger s rate is about 9 s@xmath6 .",
    "the array and its characteristics are described in more details in @xcite .",
    "bust @xcite is a large device @xmath7 area and 11.1 m height ) , located in a cave under mountain slope .",
    "the four vertical sides and four horizontal planes are completely covered with standard liquid scintillation detectors .",
    "the standard detector consists of an aluminium tank with @xmath8 dimensions and is filled with liquid scintillator on the base of white - spirit .",
    "total number of the detectors is 3180 .",
    "every counter is viewed with one pmt .",
    "the construction of bust allows one to reconstruct tracks of muons crossing the telescope .",
    "coordinates of hit detectors is used as input information for muon group parameters determination .",
    "the telescope allows one to determine the number of passing muons , their coordinates ( with 0.7 m accuracy ) and the arrival direction ( with @xmath9 degree accuracy ) .",
    "the coincidence trigger between `` andyrchy '' and bust is produced when one or more muons crossing the telescope ( @xmath10 ) coincide with the shower trigger within 51.2 microseconds ; the coincidence rate is about @xmath11 .",
    "the standard definition of the shower size @xmath12 is the total number of the charged particles ( mainly @xmath13 ) at the level of observations . as a scintillation detector measures the energy deposition , and not the number of particles , the reconstruction of shower parameters is performed in units of relativistic particles ( r.p . ) .",
    "the measured size @xmath14 is the total energy deposition in allegedly continuous infinite detector .",
    "the shower size @xmath14 , the slope of the lateral distribution function and the core location are determined by a @xmath15-like method , in which the logarithm of the energy deposition in each detector is compared with the one expected from the nkg lateral distribution function @xmath16 with @xmath17 m. the nkg function reproduces with a good accuracy the experimental data  @xcite .    in the present analysis , only the showers with : + 1 ) @xmath18 ( near vertical events ) ; + 2 ) @xmath19 fired detectors ; + 3 ) @xmath20 detectors with energy deposition @xmath21 r.p . well inside the array ; + 4 ) reconstructed axes in central part of the array ( the distance from the center is not larger than 50 m ) + were taken into account . + the accuracy of reconstruction was calculated using data obtained from a simulation that includes the experimental dispersion .",
    "figure [ fig_2 ] shows the reconstructed size spectrum together with the simulated one , the size spectrum is reconstructed without distortions for showers with @xmath22 .",
    "for these showers the accuracy of the @xmath14 determination is better than 15% and the accuracy of the axis position determination is better than 5 m. figure [ fig_3 ] shows the measured differential size spectrum taken during live time @xmath23 s ( 1501.2 days ) , in r.p",
    "the steepening of the spectrum is observed at @xmath24 .",
    "coordinates of hit bust detectors are used to reconstruct tracks of muons crossing the telescope .",
    "generally the number of muon tracks @xmath25 differs from the number of muons @xmath26 in the group . in the case where the distance between muons is small enough ( compared to the individual detector size ) the number of reconstructed muon tracks is smaller than the number of muons in the group .",
    "opposite effect is also present since interacting muons can produce particles which might increase the number of hit detectors , therefore the number of reconstructed muon tracks in such a case can be larger than the number of muons in the group . furthermore there is some arbitrariness in muon track determination : for example , a track may cross two , three or four telescope planes and so on .",
    "hence it is necessary to convert the number of reconstructed muon tracks to the number of muons in the group taking into account all mentioned effects .",
    "conversion factors depend on muon lateral distribution function .",
    "lateral distribution might depends on muon energy distribution in eas and on primary nucleus energy ( per nucleon ) etc . in order to avoid additional uncertainty we use only experimental muon tracks number spectrum for study of primary composition .",
    "the conversion of the number of muons to the number of reconstructed muon tracks is included in the calculations .",
    "the integral spectrum on the number of muon tracks for near vertical directions ( @xmath27 , effective muon threshold energy is 230 gev ) was measured for m = 1 - 250 ( ( fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ) .",
    "this spectrum was obtained using two bust data sets .",
    "the first data set has been taken during 2001 - 2004 ( live time 3.3 years ) and contains information about all the bust events . the second data set has been taken during 1984 - 1995 ( live time 9.8 years ) and contains information about bust events where 100 and more detectors were fired . the later condition corresponds to 20 or more muons crossing bust for near vertical directions .",
    "it is to be noted that owing to muon number tracks saturation there is no sense to analyze this spectrum for @xmath28 , where the relation @xmath29 becomes more than 1.5 .    [",

    "the development of eas in the earth s atmosphere have been simulated by means of the corsika code ( version 6900 ) @xcite .",
    "the qgsjetii-03 and fluka were used as the high and low energy hadronic interaction models .",
    "the corsika output files were used then as input files for andyrdet code , which performs a detector response simulation .",
    "the results of the simulations were summarized as parametrization functions of the eas characteristics , that then was used for calculations of the observables ( integral muon number spectrum , eas size spectrum , @xmath30 dependence ) . vertically arriving cr particles",
    "were used as primary cr particles .",
    "simulations were performed for nuclei with atomic number @xmath31 .",
    "primary energy per particle @xmath32 was taken from the range 10@xmath33 gev - 10@xmath34 gev with a step of 0.5 of energy decade .",
    "the integral muon number spectrum in bust was calculated numerically in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "this calculation method needs only such characteristics of high energy muon component of eas as : 1 ) @xmath35 - muon production function ( mpf ) or mean number of muons per eas produced by nucleus with atomic number a and primary energy @xmath32 ; 2 ) @xmath36 - lateral distribution function ( ldf ) ; 3 ) @xmath37 - fluctuation function ( ff ) .",
    "the eas size spectrum can be presented as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the energy spectrum of the primary nuclei and @xmath40 is the probability for primary nucleus with energy @xmath32 to produce eas with size @xmath14 at observation level .",
    "the dependence of the mean number of high energy muons on eas size was calculated taken into account the energy spectra of the primaries and anticorrelation between the number of high energy muons in eas and eas size at fixed primary energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] ) .",
    "the calculations of the observables were performed for two composition models with five groups of primary nuclei .",
