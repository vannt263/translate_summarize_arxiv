    "the quasiparticle is an important concept in modern many - body physics .",
    "the statistics and dispersion of quasiparticles determine various low energy properties of the quantum many - body system . in the general situation",
    ", there exsits interaction between the quasiparticles .",
    "that leads two major effects .",
    "one is the modification of the dispersion of excitations , corresponding to the real part of the self - energy of quasiparticle .",
    "second , the interaction can also damp a given excitation , i.e. giving quasiparticle a finite lifetime , which can be reflected by the imaginary part of the self - energy .",
    "the damping of low energy excitations is responsible for many interesting phenomena of many - body system , such as transport and thermalization .",
    "for example , in a uniform condensed bose gas with short - range interaction , the low energy excitation is phonon - like quasiparticle with linear dispersion when wavelength is larger than the healing length .",
    "while when wavelength is smaller than healing length , the excitation is free - particle - like quasiparticle with quadratic dispersion . at zero temperature , due to the residual interaction between excitations , a quasiparticle in the bec can be damped by decaying into two quasiparticles . since each product of decay",
    "must have an energy lower than the original quasiparticle , the final state phase space is restricted .",
    "this gives the damping rate a very sensitive dependence on the initial momentum @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this decay process is the so - called beliaev damping . at finite temperature ,",
    "a given quasiparticle can also be damped by absorbing thermal quasiparticles . as a result",
    ", it is very sensitive to temperature , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is known as landau damping , which was first discussed in plasma oscillation by landau @xcite .",
    "it plays an important role in various phenomena such as anomalous skin effect in metals and the damping of phonons in solids .",
    "landau - beliaev damping in a uniform bose superfluid has been widely studied both theoretically @xcite@xcitevincent@xcite and experimentally @xcite . in trapped system , since the low energy excitations are discrete , beliaev damping is forbidden .",
    "the damping of low energy modes is attributed to landau process , and the experiment damping rate has been found to be consistent with the theory of landau damping @xcite@xcite .",
    "landau - beliaev damping has also been studied in dipolar becs @xcite and in the mixture of bec with normal fermi gas @xcite .",
    "recently a bose - fermi superfluid mixture has been first realized by ens group @xcite .",
    "the dipole mode of this new superfluid mixture has been measured .",
    "it exhibits a frequency shift and an unusual damping behavior .",
    "this experimental development triggers many investigations on bose - fermi superfluid mixture @xcite@xcite@xcite@xciterotmix@xcite .",
    "the quasiparticles in this bose - fermi superfluid mixture have a quite unique feature .",
    "there are two gapless bosonic modes , which are goldstone modes of bose and fermi superfluids .",
    "it also has a gapped fermionic mode , corresponding to the cooper pair breaking .",
    "moreover , in the ens experiment , the fermi superfluid can be tuned from the bcs side to the bec side by feshbach resonance . during the crossover",
    ", the behavior of three kinds of excitations gradually changes from the bcs limit to the bec limit . in the bcs limit",
    ", the velocity of goldstone mode in fermi superfluid is quite large , approaching @xmath2 @xcite , while the gap of the fermionic mode is exponentially small .",
    "when it is tuned to the bec side , the velocity of the goldstone mode decreases monotonously @xcite@xcite , while the gap becomes larger and larger .",
    "the dispersions of the three excitations at both sides are plotted in fig.[dis ] .",
    "to understand the unusual damping behavior of dipole mode in the ens experiment , zheng and zhai study the beliaev damping of bosonic mode in bose superfluid by considering its interacting with quasiparticles in fermi superfluid at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "they found that beliaev process will be activated only if the excitation momentum exceeding a critical value @xmath3 .",
    "this threshold damping behavior , i.e. @xmath4 , is quite different at the bcs side and the bec side . to be specific , at the bcs side @xmath5 , while at the bec side @xmath6 .",
    "this is because at the bcs side , the damping is dominated by decaying into fermionic pair - breaking modes in fermi superfluid .",
    "the final state phase space of fermionic mode is restricted by density - of - state near the fermi surface , so that the damping rate is nearly a constant . on the other hand ,",
    "such a restriction does not exist at the bec side , where the damping is dominated by decaying into goldstone modes in fermi superfluid .",
    "so the damping rate grows rapidly with momentum .",
    "however , they only consider the zero - temperature case , in which landau damping is frozen .",
    "it is nature to ask the question , what will happen at finite temperature when landau damping is activated .    in this paper , we investigate landau damping of bosonic quasiparticles in bose superfluid due to its interacting with quasiparticles in fermi superfluid at finite temperature .",
    "we consider the typical cold atom situation , in which fermi superfluid is in the strongly interacting regime , while bose superfluid is in the weakly interacting regime .",
    "we find that unlike beliaev damping , the critical momentum for landau damping is zero , i.e. @xmath7 , both at the bcs side and the bec side .",
    "we obtained the temperature dependence of landau damping , showing that the damping rate is exponentially suppressed at temperature low enough at both sides .",
    "this is indeed a departure from the @xmath8 dependence in the single component bec .",
    "the momentum dependence of the damping rate is also obtained , and its behavior is quite different from the bcs side to the bec side . at bcs side , the damping rate grows linearly with momentum , while at the bec side , it is nearly a constant .",
    "this damping behavior revealing different dominated low energy quasiparticles at each side .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we construct the model for bose - fermi superfluid mixture and its mean field treatment . in sec .",
    "iii landau damping is considered by perturbation method at the bcs side . in sec .",
    "iv landau damping is calculated at the bec side . in sec .",
    "v , our main results are summarized and the connection to experiment is discussed .",
    "consider a homogeneous mixture of bose and fermi superfluid .",
    "the hamiltonian of the superfluid mixture has three parts : @xmath9 , @xmath10where @xmath11 , @xmath12 denotes bosons and fermions .",

    "the coupling constants are related to the scattering lengths : @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where the scattering lengths can be tuned by feshbach resonance .",
    "when a magnetic field is near a feshbach resonance between fermions , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are generally in the weakly interacting regime and are approximately constant according to the experiment setup .",
    "therefore for @xmath18 , we take the bogoliubov mean - field theory . for @xmath19 , we take the bcs - bec crossover mean - field theory . after mean - field treatment , one obtains @xmath20where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the quasiparticle operator for bosonic goldstone mode in bose superfluid .",

    "there is also a bosonic mode of the center - of - mass motion of cooper pairs in fermi superfluid , which is beyond bcs - bec mean - field theory .",
    "its dispersion relation at low energy is linear : @xmath34 .",

    "however , the physical origin of this exponentially suppression is not the gap , but the momentum lower bound . since only excitations with @xmath139 can contribute to the damping , there is an energy lower bound @xmath140 for thermal excitations to involve into landau damping process .",
    "for low temperature @xmath141 , the involved thermal excitations are exponentially suppressed , leading to an exponentially suppressed damping rate .",

    "the conservation of energy and momentum can always be satisfied there . as a result",
    ", there is no exponential suppressed region .",
    "now we would like to point out that the landau damping channels via interacting with the goldstone mode in fermi superfluid also exist at the bcs side .",
    "although the detail of these channels can not be covered at mean - field level , they must obey the conservation of energy and momentum .",

    "so based on our previous analysis , the corresponding energy lower bound @xmath143 is also very large at the bcs side , such that the damping process via those channels are highly suppressed in a large temperature range .",
    "it can be ignored comparing to the damping channels via interacting with the fermionic pair breaking modes at the bcs side .    at the end of this section",
    ", we should emphasize that our analysis of temperature dependence in landau damping is only viable at a relative low temperature , since both the gap of the fermi superfluid and the condensate fraction in bose superfluid will decrease with the increasing of temperature . a comprehensive self - consistent analysis of temperature dependence should take the changing of the gap and the condensate fraction into account .",
    "however , at low temperature both the gap and the condensate fraction are not sensitive to the temperature , so our result is still reasonable in this region .",
    "in summary , we have studied landau damping in bose - fermi superfluid mixture at finite temperature . unlike beliaev damping in bose - fermi superfluid mixture at zero temperature , landau damping has no critical momentum , since any quasiparticle with infinitesimal momentum can be damped by absorbing a thermal quasiparticle .",
    "however , due to energy - momentum conservation , thermal excitations in fermi superfluid will be involved into landau process only if their energy is larger than a lower bound @xmath142 . when the temperature is lower than @xmath142 , landau damping rate will be exponentially suppressed . for fermionic quasiparticles in fermi superfluid , the lower bound",
    "is determined by pair - breaking gap @xmath32 . for bosonic excitations , the lower bound",
    "is determined by @xmath143 .",
    "this exponential suppression is quite different from the power law temperature dependence of landau damping in single component bec .",
    "the reason behind is that in bose - fermi superfluid mixture , quasiparticle in bose superfluid is damped by coupling to thermal excitations in fermi superfluids with totally different dispersion . in single component bec ,",
    "quasiparticle is damped by interacting with itself , so that energy - momentum conservation can always be satisfied .",
    "therefore there will be no energy lower bound and no exponential suppression .",
    "in dipolar bose gas , there is also an exponential suppression region for landau damping @xcite . that is due to its unusual quasiparticle dispersion with maxon - roton structure .    in principle",
    ", both damping channels contributed from bosonic quasiparticles and fermionic quasiparticles in fermi superfluid exist at both sides .",
    "however , at the bcs side , we have @xmath144 , so that landau damping is dominated by fermionic excitations in fermi superfluid . at the bec side , the situation is opposite , @xmath145 .",
    "so bosonic quasiparticles in fermi superfluid dominate landau process .",
    "this result is similar to the case of zero - temperature beliaev damping .",
    "the different dominated low energy quasiparticles also lead to totally distinct momentum dependence of damping rate at the bcs side and the bec side .    in the ens experiment @xcite ,",
    "damping of dipole modes has a critical momentum even the experiment is done at finite temperature . based on our previous analysis",
    ", this phenomenon can be understood as following : the temperature of the experiment is sufficient low that landau damping with zero critical momentum is highly suppressed .",
    "then beliaev damping with nonzero critical momentum will show up @xcite .",
    "our prediction of momentum dependence of landau damping could be observed in the same experiment setup at relative high temperature , when landau damping will dominate over beliaev damping .",
