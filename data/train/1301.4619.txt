    "we aim to investigate theoretically impurity scattering in one - dimensional ( 1d ) topological superfluids .",
    "we show that an impurity - induced bound state will provide a sensitive probe for the topological order in such systems .",
    "topological superfluid is a novel state of quantum matter @xcite , which is gapped in the bulk , but hosts non - trivial zero - energy surface states - the called majorana fermions @xcite - near its boundary .",
    "it has attracted great attentions in recent years because of its potential application in topological quantum computation and quantum information @xcite .",
    "the realization of topological superfluids and the manipulation of majorana fermions are currently the most hot research topic in a variety fields of physics , ranging from condensed matter physics to ultracold atomic systems .",
    "till now , indirect evidence of the existence of topological superfluids in hybrid superconductor - semiconductor insb or inas nanowires has been reported @xcite .",
    "theoretical schemes of processing topological quantum information in such nanowire devices have also been proposed @xcite .",

    ". a realistic simulation of impurity scattering may therefore be useful for future solid - state experiments .",
    "on the other hand , we anticipate that impurity may induce new exotic bound state , thus providing a clear local probe of the topological nature of the systems that we consider .    in this paper",
    ", we use a 1d spin - orbit coupled atomic fermi gas to model 1d topological superfluids @xcite , instead of considering nanowire devices used in solid - state @xcite .",
