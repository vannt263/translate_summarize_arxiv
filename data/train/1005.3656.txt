    "observations of the transiting extrasolar planets hd209458b and hd189733b revealed an enhanced transit depth at the wavelengths of several uv resonance lines @xcite . these uv lines from the ground state are sensitive probes of the presence of atomic and ionic species .",
    "their presence enhanced the effective radius of the planet during transit , implying the planet is surrounded by an extended cloud of size comparable to or larger than its roche lobe @xcite .",
    "this was attributed to a hydrodynamic ` blow - off ' of the planet s outer atmosphere caused by the intense irradiation suffered by this hot jupiter exoplanet .",
    "an alternative explanation in which the planet is surrounded by a cloud of energetic neutral atoms caused by interactions with the host star s stellar wind has , however , been suggested @xcite .",
    "wasp-12b is one of the hottest and most irradiated transiting exoplanets and orbits extremely close to a late f - type host star @xcite .",
    "wasp-12b is , therefore , an attractive target to explore the properties of the phenomenon observed in hd209458b , and might yield evidence distinguishing between the suggested underlying causes",
    ".    the initial uv observations of hd209458b were in the far uv around the ly@xmath4 emission line .",
    "the abundance of hydrogen makes this an attractive line to observe , but the temporal and spatial variability of stellar ly@xmath4 emission is a highly undesirable complicating factor . for this reason , and to obtain better signal to noise , we observed wasp-12 in the near - uv where there are many other resonance lines @xcite , including the very strong uv resonance lines .",
    "this work became possible with the installation of the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) reinstating and enhancing our capabilities for uv spectroscopy .",
    "the planet - hosting star wasp-12 was observed for five consecutive hst orbits on 2009 september 24th and 25th with cos ; see @xcite , green et al .",

    "we used the nuv g285 m grating at the 2676  setting , which provides non - contiguous spectra over three wavelength ranges ( nuva : 25392580 , nuvb : 26552696 , and nuvc : 27702811 ) at a spectral resolution of @xmath520000 , in time - tag mode .",
    "the exposure time was 2334sec in the first hst orbit and about 3000sec per subsequent hst orbit .",
    "the optical ephemeris gives ingress during the second hst orbit and egress in the fourth hst orbit .",
    "we downloaded data from mast adopting calcos v.2.11b for calibration .",
    "despite the early date of our observations , the calcos reference files used were at a fairly mature stage for the nuv data .",
    "in particular , the flat field had been updated to its flight version . in our time series analysis",
    "we used the count rates obtained after background subtraction , rather than the flux calibrated spectra . the high quality flat - field and the relatively low background of the nuv channel ,",
    "mean the uncertainties are dominated by poisson statistics .",
    "the count rates summed over wavelength are roughly 10 ; 28 ; and 13  respectively for the nuva , nuvb , and nuvc ranges . the resulting signal to noise ratio ( snr ) per pixel in the nuvb spectrum is @xmath610 for each 3000sec exposure .",
    "figure  [ spectra ] shows the total summed spectrum in comparison with synthetic fluxes from the  stellar model atmosphere code @xcite , assuming the fundamental parameters and metallicity given by @xcite .",
    "we used the vald database @xcite for atomic line parameters and synth3 @xcite for spectral synthesis .",
    "all three regions are strongly affected by many blended photospheric absorption lines ; we observe no unabsorbed stellar continuum .",
    "the nuvb region is closest to the continuum , while the nuvc region is strongly absorbed by the doublet at 2795.5  and 2802.7 .",

    "we expect the planet s atmosphere to absorb particularly in the resonance lines of abundant elements .",
    "we used three methods to examine the data for wavelength - dependence of the transit light curve .",
    "the most prominent observed lines in the stellar photosphere are the lines , and we might expect these strong lines to be detectable in the planet s atmosphere too .",
    "we adopted the method pioneered by @xcite in their detection of the sodium d lines in the atmosphere of hd209458b .",
    "we divided the nuvc data , which is centred on the resonance lines , into  blue \" ( b ) ,  red \" ( r ) , and  center \" ( c ) spectral regions .",
    "we tried three different widths of the center band ,  narrow \" ( n ) ,  medium \" ( m ) , and  wide \" ( w ) ; see fig .",
    "[ spectra ] and table  [ table_bands ] . for each of these bands we produced a photometric time series , and the associated uncertainty based on poisson statistics .",

    " w \" bands as a function of time ( see eq .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "we looked for variations in the transit depth due to the stellar limb darkening calculating the difference between the mean photometric indexes obtained in- and out - of - transit ( see eq .  2 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "all values we obtained were clearly consistent with no variation .    to examine time dependence using @xcite s method we calculated in each band (  n \" ,  m \" , and  w \" ) the difference between the light curve of the central band and the mean light curve of the blue and red bands : @xmath21 & / & 2\\phm{.}\\\\ m_{mg}(t ) & = & m_c(t ) & - & [ m_b(t ) & + & m_r(t ) ] & / & 2\\phm{.}\\\\ w_{mg}(t ) & = & w_c(t ) & - & [ w_b(t ) & + & w_r(t ) ] & / & 2 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] in this way , we removed any limb darkening dependence .",

    "we then calculated the difference between the mean in - transit and out - of - transit flux : @xmath23 these results show the detection of a deeper transit in the  m \" and  w \" bands at 1.1@xmath0 and 2.8@xmath0 , respectively . since the value obtained in the ",
    "n \" band is comparable to the resulting photon noise error bar we believe that the non - detection is due to the very low signal level in @xmath24 along with absorption occurring in the wide @xmath25 and @xmath26 bands .",
    "the size and the significance of the detection increases as the signal included in the center band increases , just as we would expect if the enhanced transit depth in the doublet is genuine .",
    "we compared the light curves obtained for each observed wavelength range and the one calculated from visible photometry , as shown in fig .",

    "ranges we obtained a deeper transit at about 2.5@xmath0 level .",
    "these three light curves were normalised to the line passing through the out - of - transit photometric points ( first and fifth exposures ) .",
    "the slope of the three normalisation lines are @xmath28 for the nuva region , @xmath29 for the nuvb region , and @xmath30 for the nuvc region .",
    "these values are small enough that the applied normalisation did not change the transit shape .    the nuvc spectral region is clearly dominated by the resonance lines that are likely to be responsible for the detected extra depth in the transit light curve .",
    "the nuva spectral region includes resonance lines of , , , , , and @xcite .",
    "the stellar spectrum is dominated by and lines coming from low energy levels .",
    "probably , these spectral features , likely to be present also in the spectrum of the planet atmosphere , produce the observed deeper transit ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a similar case ) .",
    "the end of the second exposure is at the phase of the planet ingress , as shown in figure  [ lightcurve ] .",
    "it is notable that the nuva flux during the second exposure lies below the out - of - transit level by @xmath31 .",
    "we divided this particular exposure into three equal sub - exposures plotted as black crosses .",
    "these suggest an early ingress in the nuva spectral region .      in each of the three observed wavelength ranges we calculated a ratio spectrum ( @xmath32 ) between the in - transit spectrum ( @xmath33 ) measured in the third exposure and the out - of - transit spectrum ( @xmath34 ) , the mean of the first and fifth exposures . to these ratio spectra we associated two different uncertainties : ( i ) the standard deviation from the mean , @xmath35 , which we denote @xmath36 .",

    "assuming a gaussian distribution and having n=1024@xmath463 wavelength points , we expect 9 points in the @xmath32 array to fall outside 3@xmath0 from the mean .",
    "since the number of detected deviating wavelength points is much larger than nine we looked for correspondences with resonance lines @xcite .",
    "table  [ wavelengths ] lists the deviating wavelength points and the corresponding resonance lines .",
    "we include occurrences of resonance lines within a few  of a deviating wavelength point , for example the line at 2563.190 .    in the nuva wavelength region and adopting @xmath44 we obtained 3@xmath0 deviations corresponding to the position of three resonance lines",

    "however three other resonance lines and an line lie close to other detected deviating points . in the nuvc region",
    "we recognize immediately that most of the deviating points are in the core of the resonance lines , both assuming @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we also pick out the line at 2801.082 , while the line at 2798.269  lies close to the wavelength of another deviating point .",

    "the deviating points correspond to the core of the line where the signal level is low .",
    "this is to be expected : the low count rates at these wavelengths lead @xmath32 to be very noisy here .",
    "in contrast , with @xmath45 each element of the @xmath32 spectrum is assessed against its own poisson error . in this case",
    "the deviating points are all below the mean rate spectrum , and the deviating points appear at the margins of the line core .",
    "these points indicate excess absorption during transit .",
    "this is attributable to absorption by the planet s atmosphere .",
    "this pattern is seen not only for the two resonance lines , but also for the line at 2563.190 .",
    "this line , together with the line at 2798.269 , has the intriguing property that the difference between the position of the resonance line and of the detected deviating wavelength point(s ) corresponds to a velocity of @xmath630   ( about 3 resolution elements ) , close to the planet escape velocity of @xmath637  @xcite , although it would not then be clear why this pattern does not appear also for other detected lines of the same ion .",

    "this is a small minority of the more than 4000 lines present in the stellar spectrum .",
    "the fact that we find deviating points predominantly at wavelengths corresponding to resonance lines strongly suggests we are detecting features produced by the planet atmosphere .",
    "reassuringly , with either definition of @xmath0 , we obtained nine points that do not match any known resonance line , in perfect accordance with statistical expectations .",
    "we repeated the exercise picking out deviations in excess of 3.5@xmath0 , obtaining almost the same deviating points at the position of known resonance lines and fewer points where no resonance lines were found .",
    "we have performed three independent analyses , each of which suggests absorption in the resonance lines of metals from an extended atmosphere surrounding the transiting planet wasp-12b . in section  [ charb ]",

    "[ sec_lightcurve ] , the transit depths in the nuva , nuvb , and nuvc wavelength ranges respectively imply effective planet radii of 2.69@xmath20.24r@xmath3 , 2.18@xmath20.18r@xmath3 , and 2.66@xmath20.22r@xmath3 . wasp-12b s optical radius is @xmath48 while the mean roche lobe radius is 2.36r@xmath3 using paczyski s ( 1971 ) prescription .",
    "table  [ wavelengths ] shows that we detect enhanced transit depths at the wavelengths of resonance lines of neutral sodium , tin and manganese , and at singly ionised ytterbium , scandium , manganese , aluminum , vanadium and magnesium .",
    "finally we detect an enhanced transit depth within @xmath49  of a resonance line of doubly ionised europium .",
    "we also find the statistically expected number of anomalous transit depths at wavelengths not associated with any known resonance line .",
    "taken as a whole , these results constitute compelling evidence that wasp-12b is surrounded by an exosphere which over - fills the planet s roche lobe , confirming predictions by @xcite .",
    "this exosphere is likely composed of a number of elements / ions , including probably , , , , , , , and .",
    "the phenomenon found in hd209458b @xcite probably occurs generally for hot jupiter exoplanets . by analogy with hd209458b , and as wasp-12b and its host star are almost certainly predominantly composed of hydrogen , we expect that this exosphere is hydrogen rich .",
    "models by @xcite suggest that elements other then h and he should not be present in the upper atmosphere due to the low vertical mixing rate , but this takes jupiter as the starting point .",
    "wasp-12b is extremely close to the host star and consequently the stellar irradiation and tidal effects could induce prodigious mixing , affecting the chemistry of the planet atmosphere .",
    "our detections of several metallic elements and/or ions is certainly consistent with a metal - rich atmosphere for wasp-12b .",
    "the most surprising result is provided by the juxtaposition of our data with the optical ephemeris .",
    "we took contemporaneous optical photometry with ou - oam pirate @xcite which showed the ephemeris of @xcite remains accurate .",
    "figure  [ lightcurve ] shows the nuva transit has an early ingress and an egress consistent with the optical ephemeris . in contrast ,",
    "naive momentum considerations and hydrodynamic simulations would instead suggest that the effect of a diffuse cloud surrounding the planet would be to smear and delay egress while ingress is relatively unaffected , see e.g. fig .  1 and 2 of @xcite .",
    "in detail , the shape of the diffuse cloud may well be element / ion dependent since different elements / ions behave differently in the presence of strong radiation pressure .",
    "this can explain why we observe different transit shapes in the nuva region and the other regions . as fig .",
    "[ spectra ] shows , the stellar spectrum in the nuva region is strongly absorbed by a plethora of lines , dominated those of neutral elements .",
    "the nuvc region is also strongly absorbed in the stellar photosphere but predominantly from the doublet .",
    "it is presumably the cumulative absorption from many relatively weak spectral lines in the planet s exosphere which creates the excess transit depth in the nuva region , while table  [ wavelengths ] and eq .",
    "[ mg2depth ] demonstrate that planet s absorption in the nuvc region is associated with the doublet .",
    "the ion will experience different forces to neutral atoms in an environment where there is certainly a strong radiation field , and strong and varying large - scale magnetic fields are also likely .",
    "the nuvb light curve is least deviant from the optical transit , and this is consistent with the relative dearth of strongly absorbing lines in this spectral window , c.f .",
    "[ spectra ] .",
    "we do not have any detailed explanation for the observed early ingress in nuva , but we speculate the effect could be produced if material is lost from the planet exosphere and forms a diffuse ring or torus around the star enveloping the planet s orbital path , as models suggest @xcite .",
    "the orbital motion of the planet through this medium might compress the material in front of it .",
    "this could increase the opacity of the medium through which the star is viewed immediately before first contact .",
    "a void in the medium might be expected to form behind the planet , and consequently the egress is relatively unaffected by the diffuse ring .",
    "our observations demonstrate that cos spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets has the potential to detect many species via transmission spectroscopy , and to measure velocities and deduce spatial distributions .",
    "there are now about 40 known transiting exoplanets with orbital periods shorter than that of hd209458b .",
    "many of these transit stars significantly brighter than wasp-12b .",
    "cos spectroscopy of brighter examples will allow us probe the exosphere species - by - species examining their density , velocity and spatial distributions .",
    "this detailed information should allow us to determine whether these planets really are being photo - evaporated by their host stars , and , if so , to empirically deduce the mass loss rate .",
    "we encourage detailed element / ion dependent modeling of the exosphere in the highly irradiated environment of wasp-12b and similar systems , and observations of other similar extrasolar planets .",
