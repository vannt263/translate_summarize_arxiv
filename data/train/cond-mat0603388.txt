    "many collective processes in condensed matter physics and macromolecular chemistry have energies that fall in the far - infrared , or terahertz ( thz ) , region of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "however , in the past this spectral region has been relatively unexplored owing to a lack of bright radiation sources and appropriate detectors .",
    "the advances in ultra - fast laser technology over the last decades allowed establishing the technique of terahertz time domain spectroscopy ( thz - tds ) @xcite to perform linear spectroscopy in the far infrared region of the spectrum .",
    "tds provided a powerful in condensed matter physics @xcite and macromolecular chemistry.@xcite this technique has become popular because of its high sensitivity over a wide spectral band between 100ghz and 10thz . in general thz - tds is performed using emitters and detectors of linearly polarised radiation .",
    "however , in order study many systems of scientific interest such as birefringent and optically active materials properly it is necessary to record the full polarisation state of the radiation .",
    "a novel technique called vibrational circular dichroism ( vcd ) has substantial potential in the fields of macromolecular chemistry,@xcite and structural biology.@xcite in addition to the established technique of ( ultraviolet ) circular dichroism , vcd is used to analyse the structure of chiral molecules .",
    "it is predicted that vcd will be more powerful than conventional circular dichroism for stereo - chemical structure determination.@xcite however the technique is currently limited by insensitive and narrow band spectrometers .",
    "the particular three - dimensional structure assumed by some biomolecules , marks the difference between an inert chain of amino acids or monomers and a fully functional protein or nucleic acid.@xcite in many of these cases the three - dimensional structure is chiral causing radiation to interact differently with them depending on its circular polarisation state and therefore they are expected exhibit circular dichroism.@xcite terahertz radiation falls in the appropriate energy range of the spectrum to excite vibrational modes in many systems including biomolecules , the study of circular dichroism of such collective modes can provide fundamental information about the structure and strength of inter atomic bonds in these molecules which is of major interest to biochemists .",
    "terahertz tds relies on the ability of detecting the amplitude of the electric field as function of time rather than the intensity of the radiation , one of the two main methods to measure the electric field is photoconductive detection . in order to measure a thz electric field",
    "@xmath1 using a photoconductive receiver it is necessary to gate the receiver with an ultra - short laser pulse .",
    "the laser pulse generates free carriers in the semiconductor changing its conductivity .",
    "these carriers are accelerated by @xmath1 from the moment of the arrival of the pulse onwards thus generating a current @xmath2 between two contacts , if @xmath3 is delayed by @xmath4 with respect to the laser pulse the current will be given by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a unit vector pointing between the contacts , and @xmath7 is the response of the semiconductor .",
    "if the laser pulse is approximated by a dirac delta function and the recombination and trapping times of the substrate are assumed to be infinite , the function @xmath7 will be a step function and the electric field could be recovered by differentiating the previous equation .",
    "however the laser pulse has a non - zero duration , and the trapping and recombination time constants of the substrate are finite . assuming a laser pulse of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the full - width - at - half - maximum , and an exponential carrier trapping with time constant @xmath10 the response of the substrate would be of the form @xmath11$].@xcite in this case equation  [ e : i ] has a solution given by : @xmath12(\\omega)}{\\mathcal{f}[\\phi(t)](\\omega)}\\right](t ) } \\label{e : e}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the fourier transform operator . in order to recover the electric field",
    "it is a common practice approximate @xmath7 as a step function and differentiate the measured current , this is a good approximation as long as the laser pulse remains much shorter than the thz pulse ( @xmath14100fs ) and the trapping time remains longer than the duration of the thz pulse ( @xmath151ps ) . trapping times much longer than the duration of the thz pulse ( @xmath16ps ) are not desirable because the receiver would stay conductive for a long period of time accumulating noise on top of the signal .",
    "photograph of the three - electrode photoconductive receiver , the insets show microscope photographs of the contact structure .",
    "this receiver was designed in such a way that the current flowing through gaps formed between contacts 1 and the common contact ( com ) and between contacts 2 and com are mutually orthogonal .",
    ", height=188 ]    traditionally photoconductive detectors consist of a pair of contacts on a semiconductor , typically low temperature grown gaas or inp , separated by a small ( @xmath17 ) gap .",
    "the possibility of building similar detector capable of recording both components of the electric field of a thz pulse was explored recently.@xcite this novel type of detectors consist of three electrodes arranged in the geometry shown in figure  ( [ fig : rec ] ) .",
    "the geometrical structure of this device was designed in such a way that the vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 crossing `` gap 1 '' ( formed between contacts 1 and com ) and `` gap 2 '' ( between contact 2 and com ) are mutually orthogonal .",
    "the current @xmath20 and @xmath21 through the gaps can be measured simultaneously , replacing these currents in equation  ( [ e : i ] ) with the respective vector @xmath22 both transverse components of the electric field can be calculated .",
    "this method can measure not only the amplitude of both electric field components but also their relative phase .",
    "this allows resolving the full polarisation state of the thz wave and therefore measuring complex polarisation dependent dielectric properties of materials over a broad region of the spectrum in a single experiment .    in order to fabricate the three - electrode receiver",

    "linearly polarised thz transients were produced by exciting a 400@xmath32 gap semi - insulating gaas photoconductive switch with the 90% portion of the laser pulse .",
    "the photoconductive switch was biased with a @xmath34120v square wave at a frequency of 25khz and was mounted on a rotational stage to control the angle of the plane of polarisation of the radiation . using off - axis parabolic mirrors the thz radiation was collected , focused onto a sample space , collected again and focused onto the three - contact photoconductive receiver .",
