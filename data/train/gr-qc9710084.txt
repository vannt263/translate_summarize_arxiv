    "the appearance of initial singularities in the classical cosmological models which better describe the universe we live in constitutes a big puzzle to all cosmologists . until now",
    ", singularities are out of the scope of any physical theory .",
    "if we assume that a physical theory can describe the whole universe at every instant , even at its possible moment of creation ( which is the best attitude because it is the only way to seek the limits of physical science ) , then these classical singular points must be avoided .",
    "indeed , no one expects that classical general relativity continues to be valid under extreme situations of very high energy density and curvature .",
    "in particular , it is very plausible that quantum gravitational effects become important under these conditions , eliminating the singularities that appear classically . to see",
    "if this is indeed the case , we should construct a theory of quantum cosmology . however , any quantum theory when applied to cosmology presents new profound conceptual problems .",
    "how can we apply the standard probabilistic copenhaguen interpretation to a single system as the universe ? where in a quantum universe can we find a classical domain where we could construct our classical measuring apparatus to test and give sense to the quantum theory ? who are the observers of the whole universe ?",
    "this is not a problem of quantum gravity alone , because there is no problem with the concept of an ensemble of black holes and a classical domain outside it , but it is specific of quantum cosmology . as we can not apply the copenhaguen interpretation to quantum cosmology , we will adopt an alternative non - probabilistic interpretation , which circumvents the measurement problem because it is an ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics : it is not necessary to have a measuring apparatus or a classical domain in order to recover physical reality .",
    "it is the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we apply the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics to some specific quantum states already found in the literature @xcite , and show that the bohmian ( quantum ) trajectories are non - singular , tending to the classical trajectories when the scale factor is large .",
    "the quantum potential is the responsible for this behavior .",
    "when the scale factor is small , the quantum potential becomes large creating an effective repulsive force avoiding the singularity .",
    "when the scale factor is large , the quantum potential becomes negligible and the classical potential dominates .",
    "the minisuperspace models we study are constituted of a friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric with either dust or radiation perfect fluids @xcite .",
    "the adm quantization procedure is performed because in these cases there is a preferable time variable which rends the quantum equations into a very simple shroedinger form .",
    "the quantum solutions obtained are gaussians @xcite .",
    "the dust case is rather academic but the radiation case is important because it can mimic quite well the matter content at the very early universe . in all cases we obtain non - singular eternal models without any particle horizon .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we make a summary of the causal interpretation and its application to quantum cosmology . in section 3",
    "we abridge the results of refs .",
    "@xcite which concern this letter . in section 4",
    "we apply the causal interpretation to the solutions presented in section 3 , obtaining the bohmian trajectories .",
    "we compare our results with those of refs .",
    "we end with comments and conclusions .",
    "in this section , we will review the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "let us begin with the schrdinger equation , in the coordinate representation , for a non - relativistic particle with the hamiltonian @xmath0 :    @xmath1 \\psi ( x , t ) .\\ ] ]    writing @xmath2 , and substituting it into ( [ bsc ] ) , we obtain the following equations : @xmath3 @xmath4    the usual probabilistic interpretation takes equation ( [ bpr ] ) and understands it as a continuity equation for the probability density @xmath5 for finding the particle at position @xmath6 and time @xmath7 if a measurement is performed .",
    "all physical information about the system is contained in @xmath5 , and the total phase @xmath8 of the wave function is completely irrelevant . in this interpretation",
    ", nothing is said about @xmath8 and its evolution equation ( [ bqp ] ) .",
    "however , examining equation ( [ bpr ] ) , we can see that @xmath9 may be interpreted as a velocity field , suggesting the identification @xmath10 .",
    "hence , we can look to equation ( [ bqp ] ) as a hamilton - jacobi equation for the particle with the extra potential term @xmath11 .",
    "after this preliminary , let us introduce the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics , which is based on the _ two _ equations ( [ bqp ] ) and ( [ bpr ] ) , and not only in the last one as is the copenhaguen interpretation :    \\i ) a quantum system is composed of a particle _ and _ a field @xmath12 ( obeying the schrdinger equation ( [ bsc ] ) ) , each one having its own physical reality .",
    "\\ii ) the quantum particles follow trajectories @xmath13 , _ independent on observations_. hence , in this interpretation , we can talk about trajectories of quantum particles , contrary to the copenhaguen interpretation , where only positions at one instant of time have a physical meaning .",
    "\\iii ) the momentum of the particle is @xmath10 .",
    "\\iv ) for a statistical ensemble of particles in the same quantum field @xmath12 the probability density is @xmath14 .",
    "equation ( [ bpr ] ) guarantees the conservation of @xmath15 .",
    "let us make some comments :    \\a ) equation ( [ bqp ] ) can now be interpreted as a hamilton - jacobi type equation for a particle submited to an external potential which is the classical potential plus a new quantum potential @xmath16 hence , the particle trajectory @xmath13 satisfies the equation of motion @xmath17    \\b ) even in the regions where @xmath12 is very small , the quantum potential can be very high , as we can see from equation ( [ qp ] ) .",
    "it depends only on the form of @xmath12 , not on its absolute value .",
    "this fact brings home the non - local and contextual character of the quantum potential .",
    "this is very important because bell s inequalities together with aspect s experiments show that , in general , a quantum theory must be either non - local or non - ontological .",
    "as bohm s interpretation is ontological , it must be non - local , as it is .",
    "the quantum potential is responsible for the quantum effects .",
    "\\c ) this interpretation can be applied to a single particle . in this case ,",
    "equation ( [ bpr ] ) is just an equation to determine the function @xmath18 , which forms the quantum potential acting on the particle via equation ( [ beqm ] ) .",
    "it is not necessary to interpret @xmath5 as a probability density and hence it may not be normalizable .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath5 as a probability density is appropriate only in the case mentioned in item ( iv ) above .",
    "the causal interpretation is not , in essence , a probabilistic interpretation .",
    "\\d ) the classical limit is very simple : we only have to find the conditions for having @xmath19 .",
    "\\e ) there is no need to have a classical domain because this interpretation is ontological .",
    "the question on why in a real measurement we do not see superpositions of the pointer apparatus is answered by noting that , in a measurement , the wave function is a superposition of non - overlaping wave functions .",
    "the particle will enter in one region , and it will be influenced by the unique quantum potential obtained from the sole non - zero wave function defined on this region .",
    "the particle can not jump to other branchs because it can not pass through nodal points of the wave function .    in the next section",
    "we will perform an adm quantization of friedman - robertson - walker minisuperspace models containing either dust or radiation perfect fluids . in these cases ,",
    "a prefered time variable can be selected in terms of potentials of the velocity field of the fluids . as a time variable",
    "will be chosen before quantization , the quantum equations will be exactly like the schrdinger equation . instead of the particle position , as in the above example , the single degree of freedom of these quantum models will be the scale factor of the universe .",
    "the interpretation of the quantum solutions will run analogously to what was described above .",
    "the time evolution of the scale factor will be different from the classical one due to the presence of an extra quantum potential term in the modified hamilton - jacobi equation it satisfies .",
    "in this section we present the minisuperspace models which we will analyze using the causal interpretation .",
    "these models are obtained from the quantization of the dust and radiation fluids through the adm prescription .    for the quantization of the radiation filled frw model",

    "these models do not have particle horizons . in this case",
    "the particle horizon is proportional to the integral @xmath134 which in the gauge @xmath135 we are using evidently diverges .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the scale factor and the quantum potential for @xmath86 and @xmath123 .",
    "when @xmath43 is large , the quantum potentials go to zero , while when @xmath43 approaches its minimum size , they become important , creating an effective repulsive quantum force around this region .",
    "figures 4 and 5 show the scale factor and the quantum potential for @xmath124 and for different values of @xmath67 .",
    "note that for larger @xmath67 s the amplitude of oscillation also becomes larger .",
    "in this letter we have obtained a class of non - singular cosmological models without particle horizons by applying the causal interpretation to some quantum states of the universe already obtained in the literature @xcite and presented in section 3 .",
    "we have shown that the bohmian trajectories are the same functions of time as their corresponding mean - values obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , which makes use of the conventional copenhaguen interpretation . however , it seems to us that only in the causal approach we can arrive at definite conclusions about the existence of singularities .",
    "it is not because the mean value of a variable is different from zero at all times that this variable can not be zero sometime .",
    "nothing forbids that this be the case for the single universe we live in .",
    "the causal interpretation applied to this problem states that each individual trajectory of these quantum states is not singular , a much more stronger and valuable result .",
    "this means that if the universe is in one of these quantum states , then it is indeed non - singular because there is no quantum trajectory with singularities .    for the more realistic radiation fluid",
    ", we have obtained singularity - free models , without particle horizons , which approach the classical behavior as the universe expands . for flat and negative curvature three - surfaces",
    "this is the situation in all cases .",
