    "this value is close to the impinging active n - flux , in good agreement with the experiments reported in refs .",
    "in contrast , the average nw length for samples a2a4 is only @xmath63  m. the reduction in the axial growth rate , which becomes ga - limited , is due to the enhanced ga desorption during the second step of the growth  @xcite .",

    ", the reduction of both the coalescence degree and the area fraction can be caused by the suppression of further nucleation and/or a decrease in radial growth during the second growth step .",

    "figure  [ fig : figure4](b ) presents the values of these parameters for samples a1a4 .",
    "the average nw diameter steadily decreases from @xmath68 to @xmath69  nm from sample a1 to a4 . regarding the total nw number density , the effect of modifying the substrate temperature during growth is not as clear .",
    "increasing the temperature during the second half of the nucleation stage does not seem to influence the total nw number density which remains almost constant ( @xmath70  @xmath3 ) .",
    "only when the temperature is increased at the beginning of the nucleation stage , we observe a clear reduction to a value of @xmath71  @xmath3 for sample a4 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the continuous decrease in the coalescence degree observed in fig .  [",
    "fig : figure4](a ) is mainly caused by a reduction in radial growth during the second step of the growth .",
    "this effect is the result of a decrease in the effective ga / n ratio due to the enhanced ga desorption .",
    "the high coalescence degree of sample a4 despite exhibiting a low total nw number density as well as a small average nw diameter is surprising . a close inspection of the scanning electron micrograph shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2](h ) reveals that a significant number of nws is bent .",
    "in addition , the distance between coalesced aggregates is much larger than the average nw diameter [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : figure2](d ) ] .",
    "we suggest that nw coalescence is not only due to nw mutual misorientation and nw radial growth but also induced by electrostatic attraction during growth  @xcite .",
    "the latter effect is most likely caused by the exposure of the nw ensemble to electrons originating from the n plasma source or the rheed measurements .",
    "electrostatic attraction between adjacent nws has already been reported and systematically investigated in si nws  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is expected to be more pronounced for thin and long nws , as those of sample a4 .",
    "the intrinsic coalescence degree of sample a4 is therefore expected to be below the measured @xmath65 .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure4](c ) shows normalized photoluminescence spectra at 10 k for samples a1-a4 .",
    "the intensities of all samples are comparable despite the reduction in area coverage [ fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4](a ) ] .",
    "for all samples , the spectra are dominated by the recombination of a excitons bound to neutral oxygen [ @xmath72 which shows a full width at half maximum of @xmath73  mev .",
    "these findings indicate that the given set of growth conditions used affect neither the inhomogeneous strain in the nanowire , nor the density of nonradiative recombination centers .    the results of these experiments demonstrate that , independent of the impinging fluxes , it is possible to obtain a certain degree of control over the morphology and distribution of gan nws by increasing the substrate temperature during the nucleation stage .",
    "this growth approach is found to be indeed an efficient method to decrease the average nw diameter as well as the area coverage .",
    "however , it seems that reduced nw diameters make the nws more susceptible to electric attraction , leading to nw bending and non - intrinsic nw coalescence .",
    "therefore , despite the reduction in nw diameter , the presented nw ensembles still suffer from a non - negligible degree of coalescence .",
    "we anticipate that additional measures aimed to prevent electrostatic attraction of nws  @xcite , such as negatively biasing the substrate to deflect electrons originating from the n plasma , may enable a further reduction of the nw coalescence .",
    "the total nw number density , however , can not be significantly decreased when growing long and homogeneous nw ensembles .",
    "this fact indicates that during the second step of the growth further nucleation is not completely suppressed .",
    "our results are in striking contrast to those obtained by carnevale et al .",
    "@xcite , namely , a high degree of control over nw density by using a similar two - step growth approach .",
    "the underlying reason for this discrepancy could be the much shorter growth times used by carnevale et al .",
    "( @xmath74  min ) .",
    "the shorter times resulted not only in a lower density but also in much shorter and inhomogeneous nw ensembles .",
    "these apparently contradictory results can be reconciled by assuming that despite the presumable unfavorable nucleation conditions the nw number density increases slowly but steadily during the second step of the growth until a homogeneous nw ensemble ( as those shown in fig .",
