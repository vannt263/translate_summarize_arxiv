    "ever since the first observations of solar neutrinos  @xcite , there have been a number of claimed detections of periodicities in various solar neutrino datasets , based on works from individual research groups  @xcite .",
    "a variety of theoretical explanations have been proposed to explain these results , such as anti - correlations with solar activity  @xcite , resonant spin - flavor precession due to non - zero magnetic moment  @xcite , @xmath0-mode oscillations induced by solar rotation  @xcite , temperature variation of the solar core  @xcite , etc .",
    "however , these suggestions have not been corroborated by the experimental collaborations .",
    "the current solution to the solar neutrino puzzle is the large mixing angle mikheyev-smirnov-wolfenstein neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "if these periodicities are confirmed , they could shed insight on new physics in the neutrino sector , or point to deficiencies with the standard solar model  @xcite .    over the last decade or so ,",
    "sturrock and collaborators have argued for the detection of multiple statistically significant peaks in the measured @xmath1b neutrino flux by super - kamiokande ( super - k ) .",
    "they have shown that the most significant peaks have amplitude variations of about 7% and frequencies of about 9.43/year and 26.5/year in the 5-day and 10-day datasets , corresponding to periods of 38.75 and 13.76 days respectively .",
    "( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the most likely explanation of the peak at 9.43/year is due to the synodic rotation of the solar core , corresponding to a sidereal rotation rate of 10.43/year in the solar radiative zone  @xcite and the peak at 26.57/year is an alias of the peak at 9.43/year  @xcite .",
    "periodicities correlated with solar rotation rate have also been reported in the chlorine and gallium experiments used to detect solar neutrinos such as homestake , sage , gallex , and gno  @xcite .",
    "however , these results have not been confirmed by the analysis done by the super - k collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the super - k collaboration looked for periodic modulations from its first five years of solar neutrino data , after dividing the data into 5-day and 10-day bins using the lomb - scargle periodogram and ruled out evidence for modulations at 13.76 and 38.75 days , and also at all other frequencies  @xcite .    given the controversial and conflicting nature of these claims , it is important for an independent check of the same dataset using different analysis methods and techniques .",
    "the analysis carried out by the super - k collaboration uses the lomb - scargle periodogram and calculates the false alarm probability according to the procedure outlined in  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , there have been fundamental algorithmic improvements to the original lomb - scargle algorithm and also advances in the calculation of the significance of a detected peak , after the original papers by the experimental collaborations .",
    "also the availability of large scale computing facilities allows these more robust techniques to be easily applied to any datasets .",
    "we therefore use modern variants of these techniques to analyze the publicly available super - k solar neutrino dataset , in order to confirm or refute these various claims of periodicities .",
    "furthermore , following the cogent arguments made by sturrock et al for correlations between the peaks in super - k data and solar rotation , we only look for these peaks .",
    "the solar rotation rate varies between approximately 13.8/year ( at the equator ) to 7.7/year ( at the poles )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we restrict our searches for peaks in the super - k data in a frequency range between 7 - 14/year .    the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "i , we briefly review our implementation of the generalized lomb - scargle periodogram , including the calculation of significance of any detected peaks . in section",
    "ii , we report our analysis of the super - k dataset and present results for the significance of all the peaks found by sturrock and collaborators on the same datasets .",
    "section iii contains our conclusions . in the appendix",
    "we look for similar periodicities in the sno data and also do an estimate of the sensitivity analysis of finding a peak in the super - k solar neutrino datasets ( binned in 5-day and 10-day intervals ) .",
    "the lomb - scargle ( hereafter , ls )  @xcite periodogram is a widely used technique in astronomy and particle physics to look for periodicities in unevenly sampled datasets , and has been applied to a large number of systems from exoplanets to variable stars .",
    "it can obtained as an analytic solution , while solving the problem of fitting for a sinusoidal function by @xmath2 minimization , and hence is a special case of the maximum likelihood technique for symmetric errors  @xcite . unlike maximum - likelihood techniques ,",
    "the original ls periodogram does not account for the start and end times of each bin or any asymmetric errors , which may exist for any given dataset .    here",
    ", we shall apply the generalized ls periodogram and follow the treatment and notation from astroml  @xcite , where more details can be found .",
    "we first introduce the normal ls periodogram and then discuss the modification proposed by zechmeister and kurster  @xcite , which is known in the literature as the generalized ls periodogram .",
    "we shall also illustrate some of the key differences between this method and the ls periodogram analysis carried out by the super - k collaboration , which followed the treatment in  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the ls periodogram algorithm is to determine the angular frequency ( @xmath3 ) of a periodic signal in a time - series dataset @xmath4 given by @xmath5 .",
    "if we consider a series of measurements \\{@xmath6 } at times \\{@xmath7 } with uncertainties \\{@xmath8 } , the power at a given angular frequency ( @xmath3 ) for this dataset is given by : @xmath9 ,   \\label{eq : p}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , \\\\",
    "i(\\omega ) & = & \\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{n } w_i ( y_i-\\bar{y } ) \\sin[w_i(t_i-\\tau ) ] , \\\\ c(\\omega ) & = & \\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{n } w_i \\cos^2 [ w_i(t_i-\\tau ) ] , \\\\",
    "s(\\omega ) & = & \\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{n } w_i \\sin^2 [ w_i(t_i-\\tau ) ] ,    \\\\ \\label{eq : ls}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are given by : @xmath13 @xmath14    @xmath15 is calculated via @xmath16    one assumption in the above formalism of ls periodogram , is that @xmath11 ( computed in eq .  [ eq : bary ] ) is a good estimate for the mean value of all the observations and is same as that of the fitted function .",
    "this may not be correct if the data does not uniformly sample all the phases , or if the dataset is small and does not extend over the full duration of the sample . such errors in estimating the mean can cause aliasing problems  @xcite . therefore , to circumvent these issues , the ls periodogram was generalized to add an arbitrary offset to the mean values  @xcite .",
    "we refer to this modification as the `` generalized '' ls periodogram  @xcite .",
    "we note that similar variants of the generalized ls periodogram involving fitting for a sinusoid followed by an offset have also been proposed in literature under different names , such as `` floating - mean periodogram ''  @xcite , date - compensated discrete fourier transform  @xcite , and `` spectral significance ''  @xcite .",
    "the resulting equations have the same structure as in eq .",
    "1 - 6 and can be found in eq . 20 in ref .",
    "such a variant has also been used in the analysis of solar neutrino data  @xcite and is called `` floating - offset '' periodogram in those papers .",
    "it has been shown that the generalized ls periodogram is more sensitive than the normal one in detecting periodicities , in case the data sampling overestimates the mean  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we shall use the generalized ls periodogram for all analyses .      for each peak in the ls periodogram",
    ", we evaluate the statistical significance in two different ways .",
    "first method is to use the bayesian information criterion ( bic )  @xcite , which compares two models with different number of free parameters .",
    "bic penalizes models with additional complexity or extra free parameters .",
    "this is not usually accounted for in traditional maximum likelihood or @xmath2 minimization based analyses , where one can always get a better fit with more complex models .",
    "the value of bic for a given hypothesis is given by : @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the number of free parameters , and @xmath19 is the total number of data points .",
    "bic is widely used in astrophysics and cosmology for model comparison ( eg .  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the absolute value of bic is only of academic interest and for model comparison , one typically compares the relative values of bic between two hypotheses , and the one with a smaller value of bic is considered as the better model .",
    "therefore , in this case , to assess the significance of each peak , we compute the difference in bic between the null hypothesis ( assuming that the signal is consistent with a constant mean and white noise ) and the value of bic for a peak detected at given frequency ( @xmath3 ) : @xmath20    for purely homoscedastic errors , @xmath21bic reduces to a simple analytic expression related to the power  @xcite .",
    "we shall calculate @xmath21bic for each peak in the ls periodogram , after including the heteroscedastic errors to assess the significance .",
    "therefore , @xmath21bic has to be @xmath22 for a periodic modulation to be favored compared to pure noise .",
    "although , it is difficult to calculate a quantitative @xmath23-value from @xmath21bic , there is a proposed strength of evidence rule to qualitatively assess the relative merits of two models  @xcite and as a rule of thumb , @xmath24 for the hypothesis with a smaller value of bic to be statistically significant compared to the one with the larger value .",
    "although , in this work we apply bic to assess the significance of peaks from our ls analysis , we note that bic can also be used for model comparison in generalized likelihood based methods .    the second method to calculate",
    "the significance level of a peak at a given frequency ( @xmath3 ) is to calculate the false alarm probability of the null hypothesis ( fap ) for the power at that frequency .",
    "this is usually calculated assuming that @xmath25 has an exponential probability distribution with zero mean .",
    "the significance is then given by @xmath26  @xcite , where @xmath27 is the number of independent frequencies scanned .",
    "for a peak to be considered statistically significant , the fap has to be close to 0 .",
    "one problem with this approach is that the null hypothesis does not always satisfy the above distribution because of tails in the underlying distribution of the periodogram and the number of independent frequencies can not be precisely defined  @xcite . to circumvent these issues ,",
    "suveges  @xcite has proposed computing the significance ( or fap ) using non - parametric bootstrap resampling , which can reproduce any empirical distribution along with extreme - value methods to account for the tails . to assess the significance of any peak",
    ", we shall compute the significance using 1000 bootstrap resamples of the data .",
    "the super - k detector  @xcite is a 50 kton water cherenkov detector located in the kamioka mine , which has been collecting data for more than 20 years , starting from april 1996 in four distinct phases .",
    "super - k has detected neutrinos over six decades in an energy range from about 10 mev  @xcite to over a tev  @xcite .",
    "the phase i of super - k ( sometimes referred to as super - k - i ) lasted until july 2001 , and has produced top quality experimental results in a diverse range of topics , including the solution of the solar neutrino problem  @xcite , discovery of neutrino mass through atmospheric neutrino oscillations  @xcite , most stringent limits on relic supernova neutrinos  @xcite , spin - dependent wimp - proton couplings  @xcite , neutrino magnetic moment  @xcite , proton decay  @xcite , etc . in this paper",
    "we shall apply the generalized ls method to the first five years of super - k solar neutrino dataset , since it is publicly available .",
    "we first recapitulate the methodology and present the key results from the analysis done by the super - k collaboration reported in yoo et al  @xcite ( hereafter y03 ) , and then perform our own analysis of the super - k data .",
    "super - k has detected about 22,000 solar neutrino events between april 1996 and july 2001 .",
    "y03 did two periodicity searches with the super - k data .",
    "the first analysis was on the data divided into 5-day bins , and the second was on the data divided into 10-day bins .",
    "both these analyses were done after correcting for the modulation due to the eccentricity of the earth s orbit around the sun .",
    "y03 applied the lomb periodogram and then calculated the significance of the maximum peaks using the method outlined in  @xcite .",
    "their analysis does not take into account the errors in the flux per bin .",
    "other analyses of the same data have included the errors in fluxes .",
    "moreover , sturrock et al have also included the start and stop time of each bin and also the upper / lower error estimates  @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric errors were also considered in the analysis done by ranucci  @xcite . these and other analyses of super - k data have been done with many different methods , such as wavelet - based analysis  @xcite , rayleigh power analysis  @xcite , maximum likelihood analysis  @xcite , etc .",
    "we briefly recap the analysis done by y03 on the dataset binned in 5-days .",
    "y03 scanned 36,000 frequencies between 0.0002/day to 0.192/day .",
    "for this dataset , the maximum power was found at 8.35 days with a confidence level of 63.1% ( or fap of 36.9% ) .",
    "therefore , y03 find no evidence for any statistically significant periods in both these datasets , thus contradicting previous claims .",
    "bic , assuming the data is consistent with pure white noise , compared to the hypothesis that the data consists of a sinusoid at the given frequency ( see eq .  [ deltabic ] ) .",
    "the maximum power is detected at a frequency of 9.42/year or period of 38.75 days corresponding to fap of 1.5% and @xmath21bic of 4.8 .",
    "we note that significance level depends on the range of frequencies scanned for peaks.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      we now apply the generalized ls periodogram as implemented in  @xcite on the super - k 5-day dataset . similar to y03 ,",
    "we correct the measured flux for the eccentricity of the earth s orbit around the sun using the correction factors provided in y03 . unlike y03",
    ", we consider the heteroscedastic errors for each bin , given by the average of the upper and lower errors .",
    "the minimum frequency bin searched for is given by the reciprocal of the total duration of the dataset . since we only want to search for any modulations caused by solar rotation , we restrict our searches to a frequency range between 7/year ( period=50.76 days ) to 14/year ( period=26.11 days ) .",
    "this covers the variation in the synodic rotation rate from the solar equator to the poles  @xcite .",
    "we now present our results for the super - k dataset , including our estimated significance for the first four peaks .    for this dataset",
    ", we scanned 358 frequencies between 7 and 14/year .",
    "the ls periodogram is shown in fig .",
    "the search band is delineated by the red dashed lines in this figure .",
    "we find that the maximum power occurs at a frequency of 9.43/year , corresponding to a period of 38.75 days .",
    "the fap for this peak ( from bootstrap resampling ) is about 0.015 and @xmath21bic is about 4.8 .",
    "the next set of peaks occur at 12.31/year , 8.24/year , and 12.66/year .",
    "however , @xmath21bic for all these peaks is less than zero , indicating that they are consistent with noise .",
    "therefore , the only peak between 7 - 14/year which has @xmath21bic@xmath22 is located at 9.43/year .",
    "the location , powers and statistical significance for the first four peaks are tabulated in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "sturrock et al have analyzed the 5-day data in a number of papers over the past decade  @xcite and have found that the maximum peak is same as in our analysis at 9.43/year . in 2005 , they did multiple variants of the ls analysis of the 5-day day and found that the power has values of 11.67 and 11.24 ( if floating offset is used ) with faps of 0.7% and 1.9% .",
    "they have also evaluated the significance using generalized likelihood analysis , and the resulting fap ranges between 0.02%-1%  @xcite , with increasing significance as more information is incorporated . from their latest analysis , they argue that the peak at 9.43/year is caused by e - type @xmath0-mode oscillations due to solar rotation  @xcite .",
    "this peak corresponds to sidereal rotation rate of 10.43/year .",
    "they have also found other candidate peaks in the super - k data at 8.3/year , 10.69/year , 11.57/year , 12.01 , and 12.31/year corresponding to different spherical harmonic indices of @xmath0-mode oscillation  @xcite .",
    "a peak at 9.42/year with fap of 1.8% ( 12.1% after including asymmetric errors ) has also been detected from ls analysis by ranucci of the same data  @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the fap is a function of the frequency bandwidth used to search for periodicities .",
    "both , ranucci and y03 searched a much larger frequency range for peaks and did not find the solar rotation related frequencies to be statistically significant . on the other hand , if the peak search is done in a smaller region relevant to solar rotation and as more information gets incorporated , then the significance gets enhanced .",
    "a tabular summary of powers along with significance from different ls analysis by various authors is included in table  [ summarytable ] .    from our own analysis the only peak ( detected by sturrock et al ) , which is marginally significant from our analysis",
    "is the one at 9.43/year corresponding to a period of 38.75 days . using bootstrap resampling",
    ", we obtain a fap of 1.5% . for this peak ,",
    "the value of @xmath21bic is 4.8 , which corresponds to positive evidence using the strength of evidence rules proposed in  @xcite . in order for the peak to be considered real , @xmath21bic needs to exceed 10 .",
    "therefore , the fap which we get for this peak ( using two different methods ) is higher than that claimed by sturrock et al and does not pass the 5@xmath28 criterion used in particle physics experiments to claim detections .",
    "we also checked the significance of this peak without eccentricity correction and it amounts to @xmath21bic of 4.1 , which again does not pass the 5@xmath28 threshold . in the appendix , we shall show that with this value of @xmath21bic , the amplitude of any sinusoidal modulation is less than 6% of the mean solar neutrino flux .",
    "nevertheless , if this peak is real and corresponds to some new neutrino physics or some neglected physics in the standard solar model , then the significance of this peak would be enhanced with accumulated analysis of the full 20 years of super - k solar neutrino data .",
