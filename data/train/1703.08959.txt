    "the orientation of the magnetization in a magnetic film can be influenced using a spin - polarized current .",
    "consequently , a direct current can transfer spin angular momentum between magnetic layers , separated by either a normal metal or a thin insulating layer .",
    "this effect is called spin transfer torque ( stt ) and was first discussed in the 1970s in the context of moving magnetic domain walls @xcite and fully understood in the 1990s @xcite .",
    "stt has been of profound importance for the development of spintronic devices such as read - heads based on the giant magnetoresitive ( gmr ) effect @xcite , the spin - transfer torque magnetic random - access memory ( stt - mram ) @xcite and spin - torque nano - oscillators ( stno)@xcite .",
    "so far , the approaches to theoretically describe the magnetization dynamics induced by a spin torque usually greatly simplify or neglect the description of either the spatial inhomogeneity of the spin torque , or the three - dimensional magnetization texture @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we go beyond such approaches by coupling a finite element micromagnetic method @xcite to a numerical solver for spin transport , based on continuous random matrix theory ( crmt ) @xcite . in this way the effect of spin torque is described , with the transport and magnetic degrees of freedom treated on an equal footing .",
    "the spatial inhomogeneity of both spin transport and magnetization dynamics is thus explicitly included . in our implementation",
    ", crmt is parametrised by the same set of experimentally accessible parameters as in valet - fert theory @xcite , so that our numerical simulations contain no free parameters .",
    "we demonstrate the capabilities of our computational method by addressing theoretically the effect of spin torque on the magnetization dynamics in the perpendicularly magnetized circular spin - valve nanopillar experimentally investigated in ref .  .",
    "the device setup is kept very simple and as such serves as a prototype for spin - valve structures , which find application also in the emerging field of spin - caloritronics @xcite . in particular",
    ", the configuration of the system corresponds to a circular precession of the magnetization @xcite , and allows for a precise identification of the spin - wave ( sw ) eigen - modes in the system @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we describe the geometry of the nanopillar and also briefly review the classification of sw modes in a perpendicularly magnetised nanopillar . those modes",
    "are then identified by means of micromagnetic simulations at zero current ( thus without spin torque ) .",
    "this study was previously performed in ref .  , to which we refer for a thorough discussion . in sec .",
    "iii we describe how to couple the crmt transport code to nmag @xcite , in order to simulate the effect of spatially inhomogeneous spin transfer torque and magnetisation dynamics on the same footing .",
    "iv contains our micromagnetic simulations of current driven spin dynamics .",
    "here we identify the sw modes excited by spin transfer torque , the critical current for auto oscillations , and the frequency shift beyond the critical threshold @xcite . using crmt",
    "we provide a precise characterisation of the magnetoresistance .",
    "our simulations are then compared with the experimental results found in ref .  .",
    "finally , in the conclusion we summarise the main results of this paper and point out further possible developments .",
    "the nanopillar studied here is displayed in fig.[fig : figure1](a ) .",
    "it consists of a trilayer structure made of two permalloy ( @xmath0 alloy ) disks py@xmath1 and py@xmath2 separated by a 10 nm cu spacer .",
    "the disks have diameter @xmath3  nm and thicknesses @xmath4  nm ( upper disk ) and @xmath5  nm ( lower disk ) .",
    "the upper disk is connected to a 25  nm au contact and the lower disk to a 60  nm cu contact . in the experiment@xcite",
    ", the sample was mounted inside a magnetic resonance force microscope ( mrfm ) and the whole apparatus was placed inside a vacuum chamber operated at room temperature .",
    "the external magnetic field @xmath6 , was oriented along the pillar axis @xmath7 , which corresponds to the precession axis of the magnetisation .",
    "compensates the damping torque @xmath8 and the local magnetization vector @xmath9 precesses regularly at the larmor frequency along a circular orbit .",
    "( b ) the sw modes in each disk are bessel functions @xmath10 , with ( @xmath11 ) ( @xmath12 ) the azimuthal ( radial ) index .",
    "modes with @xmath13 correspond to a uniform in - phase precession of the magnetisation , while modes with @xmath14 correspond to a non - uniform precession , with the magnetisation vector rotating along the azimuthal direction .",
    "c ) in the case where two disks are coupled through the dipolar interaction , the sw @xmath15 modes separate into binding ( b ) and anti - binding ( a ) , which correspond , respectively , to an anti - phase precession ( occurring mainly in the thick layer ) and in - phase precession ( occurring mainly in the thin layer).,width=340 ]    the mrfm consists of an ultra - soft cantilever with a 100 nm diameter magnetic sphere glued to its tip .",
    "the sphere is positioned precisely above the center of the nano - pillar , so as to retain the axial symmetry .",
    "the mechanical - fmr spectroscopy consists in recording , by optical means , the vibration amplitude of the cantilever as a function of the bias out - of - plane magnetic field in the presence of a rf field with fixed frequency excitation @xcite .",
    "the dynamics can be excited also by injecting a dc current along @xmath7 , which excites the dynamics in the thin layer due to spin transfer torque . in the steady state ,",
    "the combined torques exerted by the rf excitations and spin transfer compensate the damping , so that the local magnetization vector precesses regularly at the larmor frequency along a circular orbit , see fig.[fig : figure1]a ) .",
    "the instantaneous magnetization @xmath16 can be decomposed into a large static component @xmath17 and a small oscillating component @xmath18 , where @xmath17 is parallel to the local precession axis ( i.e. , the direction of the external magnetic field ) , and @xmath18 is perpendicular to that axis .",
    "an essential feature of our system is that different sw modes have different spatial distribution of the phase of @xmath18 inside the magnetic disks .",
    "those modes can be excited only by rf fields with the same rotational symmetries , giving _",
    "selection rules _ for the excitation of the sw modes @xcite .    the dipolar force acting on",
    "the cantilever is proportional to the spatially averaged value of the longitudinal ( static ) component of the magnetization inside the whole nanopillar , [ eq : mzav ] = _ vm_z()d^3 .",
    "the latter is not subject to any selection rule , so that the the mechanical - fmr setup detects all possible sw modes .",
    "experimentally , it has been observed that the presence of the cantilever introduces a shift of @xmath19 ghz in the sw spectrum .",
    "this has be taken into account in our simulations .",
    "the dynamics of the magnetization can be excited also by means of an rf current flowing along the axis of the pillar , which generates an rf orthoradial oersted field , and by mean of an homogeneous in - plane rf magnetic field .",
    "we remark that , although in experiments the dynamics driven by a combination of rf fields and stt , in our simulations the dynamics is excited by stt only .",
    "the effect of the rf field is modelled by setting different initial condition for the magnetisation .    in our circuit , a positive",
    "current corresponds to a flow of electrons from the bottom py@xmath2 thick layer to the top py@xmath1 thin layer , and stabilizes the parallel configuration due to the spin transfer effect .",
    "vice - versa , a negative current stabilizes the thick layer and destabilizes the thin one . at low current , thick and thin layer are thus the fix and free layer correspondingly . however , at high enough current , both layers precess due to the repulsive dipolar interaction , as will be discussed later .      in this section ,",
    "we briefly review the magnetization dynamics in our system . for a more comprehensive discussion ,",
    "the local dynamics of the magnetisation @xmath20 , which depends continuously on the position @xmath21 in the layer @xmath22 , is described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation @xcite :    [ eq : llg1 ] = ^j",

    "the first term on the right - hand side of eq.([eq : llg1 ] ) describes the adiabatic torque , that accounts for the precession of the magnetization vector around the local equilibrium direction .",
    "this precession axis is defined by the effective magnetic field experienced locally by the magnetization , @xmath24 , which contains all the static contributions to the free energy @xmath25 of the layers @xcite . in particular",

    "we introduce here the notation @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the norm of the magnetization ( a constant of the motion ) and @xmath29 the unit vector along the magnetization direction .",
    "the dissipative term @xmath30 is responsible for the finite linewidth ( full width at half height ) of the resonance peaks , @xmath31 . for a normally magnetized nanopillar , with circular precession of the magnetization",
    ", the simple relation @xmath32 holds @xcite .",
    "if a charge current @xmath33 is flowing between two layers @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the slonczewski - berger @xcite spin transfer torque reads    [ eq : stt ] ^j=. the latter depends on the relative angle between the magnetization @xmath36 in the layer @xmath34 and the spin polarization of the current , which coincides with the direction of the magnetization @xmath37 of the polarizer ( here the thick layer ) .",

    "@xmath40 is the spin polarisation of the current and @xmath41 the volume of the thin layer .",
    "since @xmath30 and @xmath42 are collinear , spin transfer torque can compensate the damping torque , as shown in fig.[fig : figure1 ] .",
    "when the dc current through the nano - pillar reaches the threshold current @xmath43 , the thin layer starts auto - oscillating .",
    "combining eqs.([eq : damp ] ) and ( [ eq : stt ] ) , it is possible to define an effective damping for the thin layer , [ eq : effdamp ] d=(1-i_/i _ ) , which depends linearly on the spin polarized dc current @xcite .",
    "the critical thresohold corresponds to the value of the current @xmath44 at which the effective damping vanishes and the system starts auto - oscillating .",
    "since our layers are thinner than 15 nm , one can assume that the magnetization dynamics is uniform along the thickness .",
    "in this approximation , the linearized llg equation simplifies to two equations describing the circular precession of the transverse magnetization projections @xmath45 and @xmath46 around the @xmath47 axis , which depends only on the two spatial variables @xmath48 in the layer @xmath34 @xcite .",

    "there are thus three indices to label the observed eigen - modes : the usual azimuthal and radial indices for a single disk ( @xmath78 ) , plus an additional index referring to the symmetrical or anti - symmetrical ( @xmath77 or @xmath76 ) coupling between both layers .",
    "the identification of the sw modes and their symmetry is essential to couple the oscillator to an external source , since sw modes can couple only to a source with the same symmetry . here",

    "this current describes the transfer of magnetic moment @xmath68 between the two disks , and corresponds to the usual sw current written for a system of only two spins @xcite.the increase of the sw current with the dc current is due to the fact that spin transfer torque excites only one mode , which eventually dominates the spectrum , inducing a phase locking between the two disks . in this kind of discrete systems ,",
    "the magnon current is indeed a measure of the phase synchronisation of the system .",
    "by coupling crmt to micromagnetic simulations with the nmag code we allow description , on an equal footing and without free parameters , of both transport and magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "the results of this work have important consequences regarding the characterization and the optimization of the performance of stnos .    using the developed method , we have identified the nature of the modes that auto - oscillate when the current exceeds the critical threshold . in particular , we have predicted different critical currents for the modes @xmath149 and @xmath150 , and a nonlinear frequency shift of the order of 2  ghz per ma .",
    "the precise determination of the sw mode symmetry of the auto - oscillating mode is important for the phase synchronization of a stno to an external source .",
    "in fact , it will be successful only if the latter can couple efficiently to the spin transfer driven auto - oscillation modes , _",
    "i.e. _ , if it has the appropriate symmetry .",
    "the flexibility of crmt and of the procedure to couple it with nmag allows one to use our numerical tool to simulate different geometries and materials .",
    "further development and investigations are possible .",
    "a multiscale approach which combines systematically crmt with a fully quantum approach has been implemented @xcite .",
    "this should allow to compute current driven dynamics in a large variety of systems , including multi - terminal devices and tunnel junctions .",
    "we remark that in our simulations we have not taken into account the lateral diffusion of spins , since the system is described using one dimensional crmt columns , where electrons propagate only along the @xmath47 direction .",
    "this 1d model of transport is effective to describe selection rules into a perpendicularly magnetized nanopillar with magnetic field applied along @xmath156 , but more complicated configurations ( such as magnetic vortexes and multi - terminal spin valves ) may require a fully three dimensional description .    finally , further investigation is necessary to understand the behaviour of the system at high current , where nonlinear effects ( such as the dependence of the gilbert damping on current @xcite ) may play an important role . the present work can be considered as an intermediate step towards a fully 3d description of transport and magnetization dynamics in realistic systems .",
