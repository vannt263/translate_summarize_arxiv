    "-5 mm    the kepler conjecture asserts that the density of a packing of congruent balls in three dimensions is never greater than @xmath1 .",
    "this is the oldest problem in discrete geometry and is an important part of hilbert s 18th problem .",
    "an example of a packing achieving this density is the face - centered cubic packing ( figure [ fig : fcc ] ) .",
    "a packing of balls is an arrangement of nonoverlapping balls of radius 1 in euclidean space .",
    "each ball is determined by its center , so equivalently it is a collection of points in euclidean space separated by distances of at least 2 .",
    "the density of a packing is defined as the @xmath2 of the densities of the partial packings formed by the balls inside a ball with fixed center of radius @xmath3 .",
    "( by taking the @xmath2 , rather than @xmath4 as the density , we prove the kepler conjecture in the strongest possible sense . ) defined as a limit , the density is insensitive to changes in the packing in any bounded region .",
    "for example , a finite number of balls can be removed from the face - centered cubic packing without affecting its density .",
    "consequently , it is not possible to hope for any strong uniqueness results for packings of optimal density .",
    "the uniqueness established by lemma [ lemma : unique ] is nearly as strong as can be hoped for .",
    "it shows that certain local structures ( decomposition stars ) attached to the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) and hexagonal - close packings ( hcp ) are the only structures that maximize a local density function .",
    "-5 mm    the modern mathematical study of close packings can be traced to t. hariot .",
    "hariot s work ",
    "unpublished , unedited , and largely undated  shows a preoccupation with packings of balls .",
    "he seems to have first taken an interest in packings at the prompting of sir walter raleigh . at the time , hariot was raleigh s mathematical assistant , and raleigh gave him the problem of determining formulas for the number of cannonballs in regularly stacked piles .",
    "shirley , hariot s biographer , writes that this study `` led him inevitably to the corpuscular or atomic theory of matter originally deriving from lucretius and epicurus @xcite . ''",
    "kepler became involved in packings of balls through his correspondence with hariot in the early years of the 17th century .",
    "kargon writes , in his history of atomism in england ,    = cmr9    according to hariot the universe is composed of atoms with void space interposed .",
    "the atoms themselves are eternal and continuous .",
    "physical properties result from the magnitude , shape , and motion of these atoms , or corpuscles compounded from them@xmath5 .",
    "probably the most interesting application of hariot s atomic theory was in the field of optics . in a letter to kepler on 2 december 1606 hariot outlined his views .",
    "why , he asked , when a light ray falls upon the surface of a transparent medium , is it partially reflected and partially refracted ?",
    "since by the principle of uniformity , a single point can not both reflect and transmit light , the answer must lie in the supposition that the ray is resisted by some points and not others.@xmath5    it was here that hariot advised kepler to abstract himself mathematically into an atom in order to enter ` nature s house ' . in his reply of 2 august 1607",
    ", kepler declined to follow harriot , ad atomos et vacua .",
    "kepler preferred to think of the reflection - refraction problem in terms of the union of two opposing qualities  transparence and opacity .",
    "hariot was surprised .",
    "`` if those assumptions and reasons satisfy you , i am amazed . ''",
    "@xcite    despite kepler s initial reluctance to adopt an atomic theory , he was eventually swayed , and in 1611 he published an essay that explores the consequences of a theory of matter composed of small spherical particles .",
    "kepler s essay was the `` first recorded step towards a mathematical theory of the genesis of inorganic or organic form '' @xcite .",
    "kepler s essay describes the face - centered cubic packing and asserts that `` the packing will be the tightest possible , so that in no other arrangement could more pellets be stuffed into the same container . ''",
    "this assertion has come to be known as the kepler conjecture .",
    "this conjecture was verified with computer assistance in 1998 @xcite .",
    "-5 mm    the next episode in the history of this problem is a debate between isaac newton and david gregory .",
    "newton and gregory discussed the question of how many balls of equal radius can be arranged to touch a given ball .",
    "this is the three - dimensional analogue of the simple fact that in two dimensions six pennies , but no more , can be arranged to touch a central penny .",
    "this is the kissing - number problem in @xmath6-dimensions . in three dimensions ,",
    "newton said that the maximum was 12 balls , but gregory claimed that 13 might be possible .",
    "b. l. van der waerden and schtte in 1953 showed that newton was correct @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional analogue of the kepler conjecture is to show that the honeycomb packing in two dimensions gives the highest density .",
    "this result was established in 1892 by thue , with a second proof appearing in 1910 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in 1900 , hilbert made the kepler conjecture part of his 18th problem @xcite .",
    "the third part of that problem asks , `` how can one arrange most densely in space an infinite number of equal solids of given form , e.g. spheres with given radii @xmath5 , that is , how can one so fit them together that the ratio of the filled to the unfilled space may be as great as possible ? ''",
    "-5 mm    past progress toward the kepler conjecture can be arranged into four categories : ( 1 ) bounds on the density , ( 2 ) descriptions of classes of packings for which the bound of @xmath0 is known , ( 3 ) convex bodies other than balls for which the packing density can be determined precisely , ( 4 ) strategies of proof .",
    "various upper bounds have been established on the density of packings .",
    "a list of such bounds appears in @xcite .",
    "rogers s bound of @xmath7 is particularly natural @xcite .",
    "it remained the best available bound for many years .",
    "-5 mm    if the infinite dimensional space of all packings is too unwieldy , we can ask if it is possible to establish the bound @xmath0 for packings with special structures .",
    "if we restrict the problem to packings of balls whose centers are the points of a lattice , the packings are described by a finite number of parameters , and the problem becomes much more accessible .",
    "lagrange proved that the densest lattice packing in two dimensions is the familiar honeycomb arrangement @xcite .",
    "gauss proved that the densest lattice packing in three dimensions is the face - centered cubic @xcite .",
    "the enormous list of references in @xcite documents the many developments in lattice packings over the past two centuries .",
    "-5 mm    if the optimal packings of balls are too difficult to determine , we might ask whether the problem can be solved for other convex bodies . to avoid trivialities ,",
    "we restrict our attention to convex bodies whose packing density is strictly less than 1 .",
    "the first convex body in euclidean 3-space that does not tile for which the packing density was explicitly determined is an infinite cylinder @xcite . here",
    "a. bezdek and w. kuperberg prove that the optimal density is obtained by arranging the cylinders in parallel columns in the honeycomb arrangement .",
    "in 1993 , j. pach exposed the humbling depth of our ignorance when he issued the challenge to determine the packing density for some bounded convex body that does not tile space @xcite .",
    "( this challenge was met by a. bezdek @xcite . )",
    "-5 mm    in 1953 , l. fejes tth proposed a program to prove the kepler conjecture @xcite .",
    "a single voronoi cell can not lead to a bound better than the dodecahedral bound .",
    "( the dodecahedral bound is the ratio of the volume of a inscribed ball to the volume of the containing dodecahedron . )",
    "l. fejes tth considered weighted averages of the volumes of collections of voronoi cells .",
    "these weighted averages involve up to 13 voronoi cells .",
    "he showed that if a particular weighted average of volumes is greater than the volume of the rhombic dodecahedron , then the kepler conjecture follows .",
    "the kepler conjecture is an optimization problem in an infinite number of variables .",
    "l. fejes tth s weighted - average argument was the first indication that it might be possible to reduce the kepler conjecture to a problem in a finite number of variables .",
    "needless to say , calculations involving the weighted averages of the volumes of several voronoi cells are complex .",
    "l. fejes tth made another significant suggestion in @xcite .",
    "he was the first to suggest the use of computers in the kepler conjecture .",
    "after describing his program , he writes ,    = cmr9    thus it seems that the problem can be reduced to the determination of the minimum of a function of a finite number of variables , providing a programme realizable in principle . in view of the intricacy of this function we are far from attempting to determine the exact minimum .",
    "but , mindful of the rapid development of our computers , it is imaginable that the minimum may be approximated with great exactitude .    a widely publicized attempt to prove the kepler conjecture was that of wu - yi hsiang @xcite , @xcite",
    ". hsiang s approach can be viewed as a continuation and extension of l. fejes tth s program .",
    "hsiang s work contains major gaps and errors @xcite .",
