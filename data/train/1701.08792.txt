    "white dwarfs are very well - known compact objects with typical values of mass around a solar mass and the size of the earth .",
    "composed mainly by carbon , they counteract the gravitational pull by means of the pressure of the degenerate electron gas while the carbon nuclei are the principal contribution to the mass .",
    "observations estimate magnetized white dwarfs ( mwds ) surface magnetic fields in the range of @xmath1 g to @xmath2g@xcite whereas internal magnetic fields are determined indirectly using theoretical models based on macroscopic and microscopic analyses .",
    "moreover , there are observations of superluminous thermonuclear supernovae , whose progenitor could be super - chandrasekhar wds @xcite .",
    "consequently , in refs .  @xcite it was proposed to justify their existence with the presence of strong magnetic fields above @xmath3 g .    a magnetic field acting on a fermions system breaks the so(3 ) symmetry , giving rise to an anisotropy in the equations of state ( eos ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the anisotropy of the energy momentum tensor caused by the magnetic field can be included considering an axi - symmetric and poloidal strong magnetic field@xcite , which allows to model rotating magnetized white dwarfs in a self - consistent way by solving einstein - maxwell equations@xcite .",
    "the presence of the anisotropic pressures suggests that introducing an axially symmetric metric to solve einstein equation is crucial .",
    "previously we have used a cylindrical metric and obtained a maximum bound of @xmath4 g for the magnetic field of stable mwds @xcite , ruling out the possibility of super - chandrasekhar wds with strong magnetic fields .",
    "rotation is another plausible cause for the increment in mass of white dwarfs . in order to investigate this issue",
    ", we solve the rotating structure equations emerging from spherical symmetry by hartle s method despite spherical metric is no longer adequate when considering anisotropic eos. this allows us to determine if the deformation of the rotating stars accounts for stable rmwds with mass above @xmath5 .    with that aim",
    ", we first describe the equilibrium of rmwds by solving einstein equations in section [ sec : srecs ] while considering both pressures -one parallel and the other perpendicular to the magnetic field- independently .",
    "then , in section [ sec : res ] we present numerical results , and finally in section [ sec : concl ] , our conclusions .",
    "when discussing the structure of compacts objects , it must be analyzed both local and global properties of the involved matter .",
    "the first ones are described by an equation of state ( eos ) , while the latter ones comprises the dynamical response of matter at large scales to , for instance , gravity and rotation . in this paper",
    ", we consider the magnetized equations of state obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite for carbon / oxygen wds whose matter is composed by particles under the action of a constant magnetic field , which leads to a splitting of the pressure into a component parallel to the magnetic field and a perpendicular one .",
    "the values of the magnetic field are chosen below the @xmath0 g threshold mentioned before .",
    "regarding the structure equations for a slowly rotating compact object , we take into account the angular velocity ( @xmath6 ) of the star uniform and sufficiently slow so that @xmath7 , where m and r are the mass and the radius of the non - rotating wds respectively",
    ". then , the angular velocity provokes small changes in the pressure @xmath8 , energy density @xmath9 and gravitational field with respect to the corresponding quantities of the static configuration .",
    "these changes can be considered as perturbations of the non - rotating solution .",
