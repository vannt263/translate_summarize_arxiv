    "in the past two decades , notable theoretical activity has been dedicated to the study of the generalized parton distributions ( gpd s ) @xcite .",
    "gpd s allow one to access the nucleon structure in a more detailed manner than the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) studied within dis paradigm , and are a direct generalization of the latter . to access gpd s , it was proposed to study hard exclusive processes like deeply virtual compton scattering , ( dvcs ) @xmath0 @xcite or meson electroproduction , @xmath1 , at high virtuality @xmath2 of the photon originating from the scattered lepton , and low momentum transfer @xmath3 between recoiled and target nucleon . at present dvcs",
    "has been studied experimentally at hera @xcite and jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "interpretability of hard exclusive processes in terms of the gpd s that are universal objects for all such reaction , is empowered by the collinear factorization theorem @xcite that , similarly as for dis , allows for a separation of the soft hadronic amplitude from perturbative , qcd process with the former leading to four gpd s . to the lowest order in the qcd coupling , @xmath4",
    ", the full amplitude then corresponds to the handbag diagram depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : handbag ] .",
    "paratactical applications , however , rest upon , the a priori unknown rate of convergence of the perturbative expansion . at low bjorken-@xmath5 qcd corrections to the handbag diagram involve large logarithms in both @xmath6 and @xmath7 . while significant progress has been made in devising various resumation schemes  @xcite , to date no first principle solution for the scattering amplitude exists .",
    "it is also accepted that the natural physical interpretation of the low-@xmath5 dis is quite different from that of parton model description of the valence region  @xcite . that many orders in the @xmath4 expansion may been needed to describe the low-@xmath5 region is consistent with the ample evidence that in exclusive electroproduction nonperturbative phenomena play an important role in the nominally perturbative domain .",
    "the structure functions at low-@xmath5 have the behavior characteristic to pomeron and regge phenomena , while at fixed momentum transfer , exclusive photon or meson electroproduction cross sections can be well fitted in terms of simple functions of @xmath2 and the center of mass energy , @xmath8 rather then @xmath2 and @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "recently we have proposed a model in which the diffractive phenomena that are expected to govern the low-@xmath5 dis are incorporated at the parton nucleon level  @xcite . as discussed above , at the qcd side , at low-@xmath5 resumation of gluon ladders",
    "leads to complicated evolutions equations .",
    "however since at large center of mass energy , hadronic amplitudes are known to have a universal regge scaling , we employ this phenomena to construct an effective parton - nucleon amplitude . in terms of the qcd description of  @xcite , in the model an infinite class of diagrams , _",
    "i.e. _ those shown on the left panel in fig .",
    "[ model-1 ] is absorbed into the definition of the parton - nucleon blob and the resulting electroproduction amplitude is then computed from the handbag diagram .",
    "the model originates from a study of regge phenomena at the parton level in the context of dis  @xcite .",
    "such effective parton - nucleon amplitude gives the correct description of low - x structure functions , surprisingly , however , we have found that in the case of dvcs it breaks collinear factorization , _",
    "i.e. _ bjorken scaling while it naturally leads to the regge - type scaling  @xcite . upon closer examination , breaking of collinear approximation",
    "is not unexpected since it rests upon the assumption that parton - nucleon amplitude is a soft function of the invariant parton - nucleon energy , @xmath9 .",
    "this is not the case if the amplitude has regge - type , @xmath10 , @xmath11 dependence on @xmath9 .",
    "such regge - type scaling of exclusive amplitudes at large @xmath2 and all @xmath5 as opposed to bjorken - scaling was in fact predicted by bjorken and kogut in  @xcite .            in this paper",
    "we focus on applicability of the the model to dvcs in the hera kinematics , @xmath12 . for description of hera data on dvcs at low-@xmath13 two competing formalisms",
    "are used , regge models that operate with the soft and hard pomeron trajectories , as for example in the color dipole and similar models  @xcite , and the gpd - based models . to be applied phenomenologically",
    ", the gpd - based models would include models for regge - like background , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite . in general regge background thus represents a systematic effect on the extraction of gpd s .",
    "since both kinds of models are more or less successful in describing the hera dvcs data , a question arises on whether the extraction of the gpd s is model independent .",
    "moreover , if data allow for interpretation without gpd s , as in the model we study or the color dipole models , one may question the physical content of all these models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we discuss the dvcs amplitude in the handbag approximation and emerging properties of the parton - nucleon amplitude based on regge phenomenology .",

    "we considered a basis of six independent dirac - lorentz structures and discussed their regge behavior .",
    "in particular we have shown that the @xmath77-odd combinations of the direct and crossed channels ( referred to as non - singlet combinations ) follow different regge asymptotics , as compared to the @xmath77-even ( singlet ) ones . once embedded into the handbag diagram to describe the dvcs amplitude in hard kinematics , we show that only singlet combinations contribute , whereas the valence combinations do not appear and require no a priori unknown subtractions .",
    "we focused on the contribution of a single pomeron trajectory that dominates at high energies , and have demonstrate that while for dis the handbag formalism leads to the known result , @xmath161 , in the case of dvcs , the mismatch between quark propagators leads to divergent integrals in the collinear approximation .",
    "if collinear approximation is not used , the model naturally leads to regge - scaling for dvcs  @xcite with @xmath162 , with @xmath107 being the pomeron trajectory .",
    "thus we have reproduce the form that phenomenological regge models use to describe dvcs , and we have illustrated its applicability by fitting the data from hera . in he future",
    "we plan to extend our phenomenological analysis to larger values of bjorken @xmath5 , where dvcs was measured at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "since the jlab data is taken at much lower energies , however , the pomeron trajectory alone is not expected to be sufficient and other trajectories will have to be studied .",
