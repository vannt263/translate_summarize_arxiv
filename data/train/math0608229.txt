    "the zeta functions associated to finite graphs by ihara @xcite , hashimoto @xcite , bass @xcite and others , combine features of riemann s zeta function , artin l - functions , and selberg s zeta function , and may be viewed as analogues of the dedekind zeta functions of a number field .",
    "they are defined by an euler product and have an analytic continuation to a meromorphic function satisfying a functional equation .",
    "they can be expressed as the determinant of a perturbation of the graph laplacian and , for ramanujan graphs , satisfy a counterpart of the riemann hypothesis @xcite .",
    "other relevant papers are @xcite .",
    "in differential geometry , researchers have first studied compact manifolds , then infinite covers of those , and finally , noncompact manifolds with greater complexity .",
    "likewise , in the graph setting , one passes from finite graphs to infinite periodic graphs , and then possibly to other types of infinite graphs .",
    "in fact , the definition of the ihara zeta function was extended to ( countable ) periodic graphs by clair and mokhtari - sharghi @xcite , and a corresponding determinant formula was proved .",
    "they deduce this result as a specialization of the treatment of group actions on trees ( the so - called theory of tree lattices , as developed by bass , lubotzky and others , see @xcite ) .",
    "we mention @xcite for a recent review of some results on zeta functions for finite or periodic simple graphs , and @xcite for the computation of the ihara zeta function of several periodic simple graphs .    in @xcite , grigorchuk and @xmath0uk defined zeta functions of infinite discrete groups , and of some class of infinite periodic graphs ( which they call residually finite ) , and",
    "asked how to obtain the zeta function of a periodic graph by means of the zeta functions of approximating finite subgraphs , in the case of amenable or residually finite group actions .",
    "the purpose of the present work is twofold : first , to give a different proof of the main result obtained by clair and mokhtari - sharghi in @xcite ; second , to answer in the affirmative one of the questions raised by grigorchuk and @xmath0uk in @xcite .",
    "as for the first point , some combinatorial results in section [ sec : prelim ] give a more direct proof of the determinant formula in theorem [ thm : det.formula ]",
    ". moreover , the theory of analytic determinants developed in section [ sec : analyticdet ] allows us to use analytic functions instead of formal power series in that formula , as well as to establish functional equations for suitable completions of the ihara zeta function , generalizing results contained in @xcite .    as for the second point , we take advantage of the technical framework developed in this paper to show , in the case of amenable group actions , that the ihara zeta function is indeed the limit of the zeta functions of a suitable sequence of approximating finite graphs . for the sake of completeness , we mention that , in @xcite , clair and mokhtari - sharghi have given a positive answer in the case of residually finite group actions .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section [ sec : prelim ] by recalling some notions from graph theory and prove all the combinatorial results we need in the following sections . in section [ sec : zeta ] , we then define the analogue of the ihara zeta function and show that it is a holomorphic function in a suitable disc , while , in section [ sec : detformula ] , we prove a corresponding determinant formula , which relates the zeta function with the laplacian of the graph .",
    "the formulation and proof of this formula requires some care because it involves the definition and properties of a determinant for bounded operators ( acting on an infinite dimensional hilbert space and ) belonging to a von neumann algebra with a finite trace .",
    "this issue is addressed in section [ sec : analyticdet ] . in section [ sec : functeq ] , we establish several functional equations for various possible completions of the zeta function . in the final section ,",
    "we prove the approximation result mentioned above .    in closing this introduction , we note that in @xcite we define and study the ihara zeta functions attached to a new class of infinite graphs , called self - similar fractal graphs , which have greater complexity than the periodic ones .",
