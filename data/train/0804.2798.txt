    "many natural systems generate periodicities on different time scales because some of their components form closed regulation loops in addition to causal linear control chains . in biology and physiology , cardio - respiratory rhythms , rhythmic motions of limbs in walking ,",
    "rhythms underlying the release of hormones and gene expression , membrane potential oscillations , oscillations in neuronal signals , and circadian rhythms are just a few examples ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "oscillations also occur in geophysical data , e.g. , for the el - nio phenomenon , sunspot numbers , and ice age periods @xcite . in many cases",
    "several signals from different components of the complex system can be recorded simultaneously . for understanding the control chains and loops in the system ,",
    "we want to know how periodicities in the signals are generated by ( possibly directed and/or nonlinear ) interactions between its components .",
    "consequently , there is a need for identifying periodicities in one recorded signal together with the direction of causal relations to periodicities in other signals .",
    "cross - correlation analysis and transfer function analysis are traditional tools for this type of analysis",
    ". however , there are three major drawbacks of these methods : ( i ) only rather stationary data can be studied , ( ii ) a linear relationship between the signals is usually assumed , and ( iii ) the identification of causalities is hindered by the fact that the exchange of the two signals under study is identical with time inversion . we thus propose a method which helps to overcome these problems .",
    "non - stationarities are a major problem in the analysis of signals recorded from complex systems over a prolonged period of time @xcite .",
    "many internal and external perturbations are continuously influencing the system and causing interruptions of the periodic behavior .",
    "the interruptions often reset the regulatory mechanisms resulting in phase de - synchronization of the oscillations .",
    "the signals thus become _ quasi - periodic _ , consisting of many periodic patches as well as noise and trends .",
    "cross - correlation and transfer function techniques are thus problematic .",
    "in addition , there might be causal inter - relations between two signals that can not be revealed by these methods . for illustration ,",
    "let us assume that a large increase _ and _ a large decrease in signal @xmath1 ( trigger signal ) cause the same specific effect in signal @xmath2 ( target signal ) , while there is no such effect in @xmath2 if @xmath1 remains unchanged .",
    "in this situation with an essentially nonlinear coupling between the signals , both , cross - correlation analysis and spectral analysis can not reveal the effect .",
    "they show the superposition of the two branches of the interaction with opposite signs , i.e. , no effect .",
    "even if the effects on signal @xmath2 were different for increases and decreases of signal @xmath1 , one could see some relation but could not distinguish the two effects .",
    "hence , one needs a method that can separately study effects in signal @xmath2 which might occur in response to different causes in signal @xmath1 , and vice versa .",
    "a separation of effects with different typical duration or frequency scale seems also appropriate for distinguishing frequency - band selective inter - relations between signals @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "our approach for extracting inter - relations between two or more simultaneous data recordings from a complex system is based on the phase - rectified signal averaging technique ( prsa ) @xcite , which was shown to be a powerful tool for the study of quasi - periodic oscillations in noisy , non - stationary signals .",
    "the original method extracts the features in one signal before and after increases in the same signal ( or , alternatively , decreases ) . this way , information on characteristic quasi - periodicities , short - term correlations , and time inversion asymmetry ( causality )",
    "is extracted , while non - stationarities and noise are eliminated .",
    "the advanced approach introduced here extracts the features in one signal before and after increases in another signal .",
    "thus , the inter - relation between both signals can be studied separately for both coupling directions , both time directions and independent of non - stationarities and noise .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe both , the univariate and the bivariate prsa method .",
    "section 3 is dedicated to the comparison of the bivariate prsa method with the traditional cross - correlation analysis .",
    "we also address pitfalls and drawbacks of the cross - correlation analysis that are often overlooked . in section 4",
    "we discuss three model examples and quantify the capacity of the bivariate prsa method for the detection of nonlinear interactions and quasi - periodicities .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss possible applications in section 5 .",
    "let @xmath3 , @xmath4 be a long time series representing the signal under investigation .",
    "in addition to periodicities and correlations of interest , @xmath1 may contain non - stationarities , noise and recording artifacts .",
    "one example for such a signal is the series of time intervals between successive heartbeats determined from a long - term ecg ( electrocardiogram ) of a patient in a hospital . since the most pronounced peak in the ecg used for heartbeat interval determination is called the r - peak , these time series are often denoted as rr - interval ( rri ) time series .",
    "phase rectified signal averaging was shown to reduce the signal to a much shorter sequence keeping all relevant quasi - periodicities but eliminating non - stationarities , artifacts , and noise @xcite .",
    "the prsa algorithm consists of three major steps as illustrated in fig . 1 .    [ fig1 ]    _ step 1 .",
    "_ anchor points in the time series are defined according to specific features , e.g. , increases ( or , alternatively , decreases ) in the time series ( see fig .",
    "i.e. , a point @xmath5 qualifies as an anchor point if @xmath6 for triggering on increases or decreases , respectively . in order to study a lower frequency regime , averages of @xmath7 successive values of @xmath5",
    "are compared @xcite .",
    "typically half of all points of the time series will qualify as anchor points .",
    "in general , quasi - periodic oscillations in a noisy time series @xmath1 will result in anchor points predominantly found in the phase of the steepest ascent ( or decent for the second alternative in eq .",
    "( [ anchors ] ) ) , i.e. , when the phase of the signal itself is close to @xmath8 ( or close to @xmath9 ) .",
    "the phase information of the oscillations is thus obtained from the signal itself , and the signal can be _ phase - rectified _ using the anchor points .",
    "note , that in principle any boolean valued function may be used for the definition of anchor points , where true is associated with an anchor while false is not .",
    "this allows studying more complex structures in signals .",
    "_ windows , i.e. , surroundings , of length @xmath10 around each anchor point @xmath11 , @xmath12 , are identified ( see fig .  [ fig1](b ) ) ; @xmath13 is the total number of regarded anchor points .",
    "the surrounding of @xmath11 is @xmath14 the parameter @xmath15 has to be chosen larger than the expected coherence time of the periodicities in the signal ; it must definitely exceed the period of the slowest oscillation that one wants to detect .",
    "all anchor points with indices @xmath16 smaller than @xmath17 and larger than @xmath18 , i.e. , at the very beginning and at the end of the time series , have incomplete surroundings .",
    "the same holds for windows containing missing data points due to , e.g. , measurement artifacts , instrument failure , or outliers .",
    "_ all windows @xmath19 , @xmath12 are aligned at their anchor points @xmath11 , and the phase - rectified signal average @xmath20 is obtained by averaging over all windows ( see figs .",
    "1(c ) and ( d ) ) , @xmath21 if @xmath22 is a missing data point , it is replaced by 0 , and @xmath13 is substituted by @xmath23 denoting the number of non - missing points at position @xmath24 . including windows with missing data points yields better statistics and",
    "allows investigation of time series with a few artifacts . in general a well - behaved average @xmath25 can be expected when there are at least @xmath26 to @xmath27 anchor points , i.e. , @xmath28 to @xmath29 for the length of the record .    in the average , non - periodic components ( not phase - synchronized with the anchor",
    "points ) , i.e. , non - stationarities , non - identified artifacts , and noise , cancel out .",
    "only events that have a fixed phase relationship with the anchor points , i.e. , periodicities and quasi - periodicities , survive the procedure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the prsa signal @xmath20 represents the most important features of the original data containing all quasi - periodicities aligned with phase zero in the center ( at @xmath30 ) . applying the prsa before traditional spectral analysis significantly improves the quality of the spectra in the presence of noise and non - stationarities @xcite .",
    "differences between prsa curves obtained by applying either of the two criteria in eq .",
    "( [ anchors ] ) will indicate missing time reversal symmetry of the original signal .",
    "hence , nonlinear and non time - reversal invariant processes , with different phenomena occurring during increasing and decreasing parts , can be studied in detail .",
    "optionally , it might be meaningful to weight the windows according to some criteria , e.g. , according to the magnitude of changes at anchor positions in the trigger signal . with anchors defined at increases",
    "eq . becomes @xmath31 with weights @xmath32 , e.g. , @xmath33 .",
    "of course , other weights could be defined as well .",
    "now , we suggest a generalization of the univariate prsa for studying the inter - relations between two signals @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "if many signals are recorded simultaneously , representing the dynamics of the complex system , each pair can be characterized accordingly .",
    "the method is nearly identical with the univariate approach described in the previous subsection , except for the usage of different signals in step one ( @xmath34 trigger signal @xmath1 ) and in steps two and three ( @xmath34 target signal @xmath2 ) .",
    "specifically , anchor points @xmath16 , @xmath12 are defined for increases ( or alternatively decreases ) in the trigger signal @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath35 ( step 1 ) , while surroundings are defined ( step 2 ) and averaged ( step 3 ) for the target signal @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "this yields the bivariate phase rectified signal average @xmath37 : @xmath38 the transfer of the anchor points is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ bprsa_figure](a),(b ) .     and ( b ) transferred to the target signal @xmath2 . here",

    ", @xmath39 is obtained ( c ) .",
    "likewise , changes in @xmath1 caused by increases in @xmath2 can be studied by exchanging trigger and target signal , @xmath40 in ( d ) . ]",
    "[ bprsa_figure ]    bprsa is a non - symmetric algorithm , i.e. , the exchange of trigger signal @xmath1 and target signal @xmath2 will result in a different bprsa curve , see [ bprsa_figure](c),(d ) .",
    "more complex boolean or weighted anchor criteria , even ones based on more than one trigger signal , are possible .",
    "for example , the typical behavior of a target signal @xmath2 can be studied around points of time ( anchors ) with increases of signal @xmath41 and positive values of signal @xmath42 . for a specific example of a conditional anchor criterion consider the three signals heartbeat intervals , respiratory phase , and blood pressure .",
    "one can study characteristic heartbeat intervals ( target signal @xmath2 ) around increasing systolic blood pressure ( first trigger signal @xmath41 ) and at a certain respiratory phase ( second trigger signal @xmath42 ) .",
    "first attempts revealed promising results for the investigation of baroreflex properties and will be reported in a medical journal .",
    "although cross - correlation analysis is considered as a well established tool for the study of inter - relations between two signals in many applications , only a few authors have specifically studied its reliability @xcite . for two discretely measured signals @xmath43 and",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 , the _ normalized cross - correlation function _ is most commonly defined as    @xmath46    [ discrete_ccf ]    here , @xmath47 and @xmath48^{1/2}$ ] are mean and standard deviation of both series @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "this definition assumes that both @xmath50 and @xmath51 do not vary in time , i.e. , they do not depend on the segments of the time series selected for the study .",
    "this corresponds to the assumption of weak stationarity .",
    "strong stationarity additionally requires constancy of all other moments . for studies discussing the replacement of @xmath52 and @xmath53 by local estimates , e.g. running averages ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "note , however , that some cross - correlations might be reduced or eliminated by this so - called pre - whitening procedure , which is therefore unsafe .",
    "another problem of cross - correlation functions is that the exchange of the two signals @xmath1 and @xmath2 corresponds to replacing @xmath24 by @xmath54 , i.e. , time inversion .",
    "hence , causality relations between the two series can hardly be assessed . in general , the points of @xmath55 are highly auto - correlated , e.g. , @xmath55 is strongly correlated with @xmath56 .",
    "i.e. , neighboring points in @xmath55 are stronger correlated with each other than neighboring points in the original time series @xcite .",
    "this self - correlation causes long living trends in @xmath55 , e.g. , a slow decay after a peak , which is at risk of misinterpretation .",
    "furthermore , the sum in eqs .",
    "( [ discrete_ccf ] ) runs over @xmath57 terms , while it is divided by @xmath58 instead of @xmath57 .",
    "this procedure corresponds to a standard averaging procedure only in the limit of very long data ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "nevertheless , most statistical toolkits employ the definition ( [ discrete_ccf ] ) , because the convolution theorem and fast fourier transform can be used to speed up the calculations significantly in this case by application of the wiener - khinchin theorem .",
    "some authors even argue for an increase in precision because the normalization @xmath60 reduces the mean - square variance of @xmath55 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , this non - matching prefactor results in a bias towards zero with increasing time lag @xmath24 for small @xmath58 , causing a triangular - shaped behavior of @xmath55 .",
    "consequently , the value of @xmath61 for the center of a peak in @xmath55 is systematically underestimated @xcite .",
    "we are convinced that the correction factor @xmath62 which transforms @xmath55 from eqs .",
    "( [ discrete_ccf ] ) into the _ correctly normalized cross - correlation function _",
    "@xmath63 must be used to obtain reliable results except for very long data .",
    "if the considered data is not fully stationary , one might want to use only the values @xmath5 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 with @xmath66 for calculating @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "this approach is known as _ local cross - correlation _ in literature ; it is equivalent to the pearson @xmath69 ( product - moment ) correlation coefficient for the two overlapping pieces .",
    "since the partial means and standard deviations will depend on @xmath24 , the computational effort is significantly increased .",
    "the bias mentioned in the previous paragraph is not completely removed in this approach @xcite ( although it is weaker than for the standard definitions ( [ discrete_ccf ] ) ) .",
    "in addition , problems with autoregressive moving average processes ( arma ) were reported @xcite .",
    "since the cross - correlation approach does not work well for non - stationary data anyway , we do not consider local cross - correlation here .      in bprsa",
    ", anchor points usually occur in all parts of the trigger signal @xmath1",
    ". the average of @xmath70 for all @xmath24 will thus be approximately the global average of the whole signal , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "consequently , subtraction of this mean from @xmath71 yields positive and negative values as in the cross - correlation function .",
    "@xmath72 can thus be interpreted in a similar way as an unnormalized cross - correlation function .",
    "if one divides by the global standard deviation , @xmath68 , the resulting quantity @xmath73 is also normalized .",
    "it can be compared with @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ discrete_ccf2 ] ) and interpreted in a similar way .",
    "note that  different from cross - correlation analysis  this rescaling is just the last step , and @xmath53 does not enter into the calculation of @xmath75 .",
    "hence , the shape of the curve can not be affected by non - stationarities , i.e. , inaccurate @xmath53 .",
    "there is no practical advantage of normalized bprsa , unless the behavior of the curves for different signals , e.g. , triggering directions and , shall be directly compared .",
    "however , the global mean @xmath53 and global standard deviation @xmath68 might not exist due to non - stationarities and in this case normalization is not recommended .",
    "in some applications it is even preferred to study the unnormalized bprsa curves .",
    "for example , in quantifying the action of blood pressure upon heartbeat regulation via the baroreflex mechanism in the human cardiovascular system , the variation of the time intervals between successive heartbeats in reaction to increases in blood pressure needs to be measured . in this case",
    "the units of both signals have to be kept , and the measure characterizing the baroreflex must have the unit ms / mmhg , i.e. , time difference divided by pressure difference .",
    "in fact , cross - correlation studies can only yield either quantities without units ( if normalized ) or quantities which are products of both original units .",
    "quantities with the unit of only one original series or their ratio ( as needed for the baroreflex ) can not be obtained .",
    "hence , there is no way to obtain a meaningful measure for the baroreflex from a cross - correlation analysis , although the baroreflex is a typical example of a meaningful inter - relation between two components of a complex system .",
    "effects occurring in @xmath76 for @xmath77 can be easily recognized as consequences of the triggering events in the trigger signal @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "effects seen in @xmath76 for @xmath78 are likely to be causes for the actual triggering events .",
    "note that a similar conclusion is also valid for the cross - correlation function @xmath74 , since effects observed for @xmath77 and @xmath78 are probably due to interactions from signal @xmath1 onto signal @xmath2 and vice versa .",
    "however , bprsa allows separating these causality effects from nonlinear effects , as we will see in the following .",
    "if the interaction from signal @xmath1 to signal @xmath2 is linear , we will find @xmath79 , since increases and decreases in @xmath1 must cause opposite effects in @xmath2 . accordingly",
    ", @xmath80 shows that the interaction from @xmath2 to @xmath1 is linear .",
    "if the interaction between both signals is fully symmetric , time inversion is equivalent with exchanging the signals , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "deviations from this behavior show non - symmetric coupling as do deviations from @xmath83 in cross - correlation analysis .",
    "however , this can be checked independent of the linear or nonlinear character of the interactions between the signals .",
    "note that normalized bprsa must be considered in this case , eq . .",
    "it is straightforward to write down similar relations for testing further hypothesis regarding the inter - relations between both signals .      in this subsection",
    "we will see how the bprsa overcomes the disadvantages of cross - correlation analysis described before .",
    "_ 1 . causality and nonlinear interactions_. as we have shown in the previous subsection , more information on the linearity or nonlinearity of the interactions and on time - reversal symmetry can be obtained from bprsa curves than from the cross - correlation function .",
    "time delays_. the estimation of ( positively or negatively ) time - delayed inter - relations between both signals is straightforward , just as in cross - correlation analysis .",
    "_ 3 . missing data and outliers_. bprsa",
    "can easily cope with missing data ( e.g. , measurement artifacts , instrument failure , or outliers ) in both series @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "invalid values in @xmath1 just can not become anchor points .",
    "invalid values in @xmath2 will be disregarded ( see text following eq . ) .",
    "( non-)stationarity of the data_. in the definition of bprsa ( section 2 , in particular eq .",
    "( [ bprsa_averaging ] ) ) neither means nor standard deviations of both signals @xmath1 and @xmath2 are needed . hence , no direct problems arise for non - stationary data . in particular data with a piecewise constant trend , which is often observed in medical data recordings ,",
    "will cause no problems in bprsa , because eq .  ( [ bprsa_averaging ] ) is a simple linear arithmetic averaging procedure .",
    "the deviations from a small or large local average will have the same weight in this averaging procedure .",
    "hence , bprsa does not need pre - whitening of the data before analysis .",
    "cross - correlation analysis , on the other hand , will be disturbed severely by a piecewise constant trend , because the deviations @xmath84 from the global average will be dominated by this trend ( see subsection 4.3 for an example ) .",
    "the same holds for an oscillating trend in the target signal @xmath2 which is uncorrelated with the trigger signal @xmath1 .",
    "however , such a trend in @xmath1 will selectively cause anchor points and thus disturb also bprsa ; consequently more anchor points , i.e. , longer data , will be needed !",
    "a slowly varying , monotonous ( e.g. , polynomial ) trend in the target signal will bend the bprsa curve , since the local means are different in the beginning and at the end of the signal and in the beginning and at the end of each segment .",
    "however , this bending is definitely not stronger than a similar bending of the cross - correlation function .",
    "trends in the trigger signal @xmath1 will modify the fraction of anchor points for increases and decreases , which has little effect on @xmath76 unless these trends are very strong .",
    "enhanced auto - correlations_. unlike the cross - correlation function @xcite , which is often dominated by low frequencies , bprsa does not show artificially enhanced auto - correlations . on the contrary , low frequencies are reduced due to the filtering characteristics ( see next point ) .",
    "this makes bprsa particularly attractive for studying signals with underlying @xmath85- rather than white noise .",

    "the large power of @xmath159 has been chosen for visual reasons only ; it enhances the differences as does the absence of noise . the cross - correlation analysis ( see figs . [ bprsa_nonlinear](f , g ) ) can not distinguish ( i ) the cases @xmath160 and @xmath161 as well as ( ii ) both possible analysis directions .",
    "studying only the cross - correlation function could thus lead to the false conclusion of equivalently related signals @xmath2 and @xmath137 .",
    "bprsa , on the other hand , can clearly distinguish the four cases except for @xmath162 .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the shape of the bprsa curve needs not be the same as the original target signal ( compare figs .",
    "[ bprsa_nonlinear](b , d ) ) .",
    "a presence of noise might disturb the bprsa signal , making the identification of characteristics in trigger and target signal more difficult , depending on the signal to noise ratio .      , amplitude @xmath163 , and normalized additional @xmath85 noise with @xmath164 ; length @xmath140 .",
    "in ( a , b ) , different partial trends of random offset , slope and duration were added ; ( c ) is the same as ( b ) but without trends .",

    "the points are connected for visual reasons only ; all values are dimensionless . ]",
    "now let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be two independent @xmath85-noise signals with zero mean and unit variance generated by fourier filtering .",
    "furthermore , we add to both signals a periodic component @xmath168 .",
    "moreover , non - stationarities are introduced by adding piecewise linear trends as follows .",
    "we start with some initial value for the slope @xmath169 and the initial offset @xmath170 . at random positions , the offset and the slope",
    "are changed randomly within a previously defined range ; the trends added to @xmath1 and @xmath2 are independent ( see figs . [ bprsa_trends](a , b ) ) .",
    "for comparison we define a third signal @xmath137 that equals @xmath2 without trends ( fig .",
    "[ bprsa_trends](c ) ) .",
    "trends in the trigger signal will hardly affect the identification of the anchor points , because the anchor criteria defined in eq .",
    "is only based on local fluctuations .",
    "note , that this might be different when using a more sophisticated boolean anchor function as discussed earlier ( compare bprsa directions @xmath171 and @xmath172 in fig .",
    "[ bprsa_trends](d , e ) ) .    on the other hand , the influence of trends in the target signal can not be neglected",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ bprsa_trends](e ) ) . in case of a significant global trend in the target signal , e.g. , more decreasing parts than increasing parts",
    ", the global trend will be present in the bprsa curve , although it is diminished .",
    "note , that due to trends which do not cancel out completely @xmath173 in general ( compare solid lines and triangles in figs .",
    "[ bprsa_trends](d , e ) ) .",
    "when the bprsa shows no trend at all , the target signal is either characterized by no trends or the duration and slopes of increasing and decreasing trends cancel out .    as an implication of the different influences of trends in the trigger and target",
    "signal one can identify which signal is disturbed by trends by comparing the bprsa for opposite trigger - target directions ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "this is inherently impossible with cross - correlation analysis since the algorithm does not distinguish between both signals .",
    "besides , trends are harmful for the definition of a global mean and thus disturb the standard cross - correlation analysis .",
    "therefore , its results may suggest a wrong correlation behavior . in figs .",
    "[ bprsa_trends](f),(g ) one finds , by chance , anti - correlated behavior although the signals themselves , i.e. , the sinusoids , are strongly positively correlated . for the same reason a normalized bprsa as defined in eq .   can not be applied here . of course",
    ", in this simple example the use of the local cross - correlation function , which is based on local means rather than on a global mean , might help to remove the influence of the trends .",
    "in summary we have shown that the bprsa method has several advantages compared with conventional cross - correlation analysis in the detection of quasi - periodicities in noisy non - stationary data with oscillations of finite coherence time .",
    "the method allows the analysis of the inter - relationship between two signals , in particular effects in one signal triggered by events in another signal",
    ".    this capability can be useful for the study of the inter - relation between respiration , heart rate and blood pressure , i.e. , the cardiovascular regulation , which is an important topic in human physiology .",
    "cardiovascular functions are controlled by the tone of the sympathetic and parasympathetic ( autonomic ) nervous system that is influenced by the baroreflex , a homeostatic regulation that maintains a stable blood pressure .",
    "an elevated blood pressure reflexively causes the blood pressure to decrease and vice versa .",
    "it is controlled through several stretch sensitive mechanoreceptors ( baroreceptors ) .",
    "it is believed that cardiovascular illnesses disturb the baroreflex .",
    "related parameters might thus improve currently used predictors .",
    "hence , the detection of quasi - periodicities reflecting regulation processes of the autonomic cardiac nervous system coinciding with increases or decreases of blood pressure in long records of human heart rate is of high clinical relevance .",
    "autonomic dysfunction is closely related to cardiac mortality and susceptibility to life - threatening arrhythmic events @xcite .",
    "the assessment of heart rate variability by the prsa based deceleration capacity ( dc ) parameter @xcite was shown to be superior to spectral parameters proposed earlier for risk prediction @xcite .",
    "bprsa seems to be promising for the definition of an advanced risk predictor that respects the coupling of heart rate variability and blood pressure .",
    "further possible applications of bprsa in biology and physiology include rhythmic motions of limbs in walking , muscle contractions , rhythms underlying the release of hormones that regulate growth and metabolism , periodicities in gene expression , membrane potential oscillations , oscillations in neuronal signals , and circadian rhythms @xcite .",
    "we believe that the range of suitable applications for the bprsa method also includes quasi - periodic geophysical data , e.g. , the el - nio phenomenon , sunspot numbers , and ice age periods @xcite .",
    "in addition , the analysis of complex elastic wave patterns to study seismic events or to determine material properties of granular matter might be improved by bprsa .",
    "the study of non - stationary quasi - periodic complex waveforms is also a common task in the analysis and recognition of speech or music ."
