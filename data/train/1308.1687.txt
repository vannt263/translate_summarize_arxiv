    ", the rate per unit volume of sub - energetic grbs indicates that they are @xmath13 times more common than cosmological grbs ( @xcite ) , which led some authors to conclude that ordinary and sub - energetic grbs have different origins ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recent simulations of jet - driven stellar explosions pointed instead to the possibility that the observed rates of events might reflect the distribution of the duration of the central engine activity that powers the jet @xcite .",

    "the same possibility was considered by @xcite for grb060218 .",
    "the collapse of massive stars typically leads to a black hole plus long - lived debris torus system ( @xcite ) or to a fast - rotating , highly - magnetized pulsar ( i.e. , a magnetar , e.g. , @xcite ) .    accretion onto a black hole is a well known source of high - energy radiation . from the observed @xmath166 at @xmath167 days after the explosion",
    ", we estimate an accretion rate of @xmath168 assuming an accretion efficiency @xmath169 ( e.g. @xcite ) and an x - ray to bolometric flux correction @xmath170 ( @xcite ) . the inferred range of @xmath171 is consistent with the extrapolation of the expected accretion rates from fall back calculated by @xcite in the context of the collapsar model .",
    "this result would point to similar late - time accretion rates between bright bursts ( for which the model by @xcite was originally developed ) and sub - energetic grbs .",
    "the observed temporal decay @xmath172 is however significantly shallower than what expected in the context of fall back accretion models that predict @xmath173 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while the mild @xmath174 decay does not rule out accretion as source of the late - time x - ray excess of radiation , it does require substantial departure from the simple fall - back picture .",
    "alternatively , grb100316d could have signaled the birth of a magnetar . with @xmath175",
    "coupled to the non - relativistic ejecta ( e.g. @xcite ) , grb100316d approaches the limit of the magnetar models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ekvelocity ] ) . can be extracted from the black hole plus long - lived debris torus system ( e.g. @xcite ) . ] for a maximally spinning , @xmath176 proto - neutron star the total energy release can not exceed its rotation energy budget @xmath177 ( e.g. @xcite ) . in order to power a @xmath178 explosion , the highly - magnetized ( @xmath179 ) compact object is required to be born rapidly rotating ( initial spin period @xmath180 ) , suggesting that grb100316d is associated with the fastest and most extreme proto - magnetars . while a significant fraction of rotation energy might be extracted in a few seconds ( e.g. @xcite ) , the spin - down luminosity from the newly born magnetar is a source of long - lasting emission decaying as @xmath181 , where @xmath182 corresponds to the magnetic dipole spin down . as in the case of grb060218 ( @xcite ) , the shallow @xmath183 temporal decay argues for a spin - down braking index @xmath184 ( where @xmath185 is the braking law and @xmath186 is for the standard magnetic dipole radiation with constant magnetic field .",
    "@xmath187 is the pulsar spin frequency ) .",
    "interestingly , a braking index @xmath188 has been observed in very young pulsars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the very soft x - ray spectrum could be either intrinsic or the result of the interaction of the central engine radiation with material ejected by the progenitor ( e.g. via multiple inelastic electron scatterings that suppress high energy radiation ) .",
    "broad - band late - time monitoring of the sub - energetic grb100316d associated with sn2010bh at radio and x - ray wavelengths allowed us to constrain the properties of the explosion and its environment .",
    "the explosion is energetically dominated by the non - relativistic material which carries @xmath189 .",
    "a modest @xmath190 is coupled to quasi - spherical , mildly relativistic ( @xmath191 ) ejecta expanding into a medium previously shaped by the progenitor mass - loss .",
    "we infer a progenitor mass - loss rate of @xmath192 , for an assumed wind velocity @xmath3 and microphysical parameters @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "these properties are intermediate between the highly relativistic , collimated grbs and the spherical , ordinary hydrogen - stripped sne . like grbs , but different than ordinary type ib / c sne , the kinetic energy profile of grb100316d argues for the presence of a central engine that drives the explosion .",
    "however , unlike grbs , our broad - band spectral modeling clearly identifies the presence of an excess of soft x - ray radiation with respect to the synchrotron afterglow model at late times .",
    "this result leads us to conclude that the late - time ( @xmath4 days ) non - thermal radio and x - ray emission does not originate from the same population of electrons and are likely attributable to two different components .",
    "we connect the excess of soft x - ray radiation to long - lasting activity of the explosion central engine , either in the form of a black hole plus torus system , or a magnetar .",
    "the very high kinetic energy ( @xmath189 ) carried by the non - relativistic ejecta of grb100316d implies that only the most rapidly rotating magnetars with spin period @xmath180 can power the explosion .",
    "accretion onto a compact object can not be excluded , but requires some significant departure from the standard fall - back scenario .",
    "grb060218 is the only other explosion to date where a similar super - soft x - ray excess has been identified at late times ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , given the intrinsic faintness of the central engine component , it is possible that a similar emission is ubiquitous in long grbs , but easily over - shone by the external shock afterglow associated with the highly relativistic jet .    finally , grb100316d and its cosmic twin , grb060218 , define a class of sub - energetic explosions that are clearly distinguished from ordinary grbs and other sub - energetic grbs ( e.g. 120422a , zauderer et al .",
    ", in prep . ) by : ( i ) a very long and smooth @xmath6-ray prompt emission phase ( @xmath193 s ) with spectral peak energy @xmath194 kev , ( ii ) shallower than average late - time decay of the x - ray light - curve , ( iii ) exceptionally soft late - time x - ray spectrum , and ( iv ) evidence for an excess of soft x - ray emission with respect to the external shock afterglow at late times .",
    "these two grbs have also been claimed to show evidence for a thermal component in their early time x - ray afterglow ( @xcite ) .",
    "our re - analysis however points to a substantially reduced statistical significance of the black - body component in the early time spectra of grb100316d .",
    "further progress in our understanding of central - engine driven explosions strongly relies on the ability to constrain their energetics , collimation and environment properties .",
    "this is a task that can only be accomplished with coordinated efforts at radio and x - ray wavelengths at late times , when the central engine reveals itself in the x - rays .",
