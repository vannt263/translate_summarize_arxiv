    "over the last twenty years there has been a growing interest in the spectral theory of non - self - adjoint operators , as they appear naturally in many areas , for example    * in the solvability theory of linear pde s given by non - normal operators , * in mathematical physics , for example when studying scattering poles ( quantum resonances ) , * in the spectral analysis of kramers - fokker - planck type operators .    a major difficulty when dealing with non - self - adjoint operators is the fact that , as opposed to self - adjoint operators , the norm of the resolvent can be very large even far away from the spectrum of the operator . as a consequence",
    "the spectrum can be highly unstable even under very small perturbations , see for example @xcite for a very good overview .",
    "renewed activity in this field has been sparked by works in numerical analysis by l.n.trefethen and m. embree , see e.g. @xcite , which provides a significant tool for studying spectral instability : the so - called @xmath10-pseudospectrum which consists of the regions where the resolvent is large and thus indicates how far the eigenvalues can spread under perturbations .",
