    "cavity qed ( cqed ) investigates the interaction of atoms with confined electromagnetic field modes .",
    "when atoms are coupled to a high - finesse optical resonator , the usual free - space dipole force they experience is strongly enhanced and , at the same time , the back - action of atoms on the confined light field can not be ignored any longer . as a consequence both atoms and light must be treated on the same footing and the dynamics for the atomic motion and the cavity field becomes strongly nonlinear .",
    "these hybrid systems open the way to new physical situations , in particular when cold atoms , bosonic or fermionic , are loaded inside optical cavities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to probe the properties of these systems in a non - destructive way by using the field leaking outside the cavity @xcite .    trapping bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in laser - driven high - finesse optical cavities @xcite has been realized experimentally recently @xcite .",
    "the strong atom - cavity coupling enhances nonlinear effects and bistable behavior @xcite and even chaos @xcite set in . in the dispersive regime",
    "where the pump and cavity fields are both far - detuned from the atomic transition , the light fields impart forces on the atoms which thus move . in turn , the light fields pick up phase shifts induced by the refractive index of this moving atomic dielectric medium .",
    "this alters the light forces , thus the atomic motion , thus the accumulated dispersive phase shifts , and this combined atom - field process loops self - consistently . as a result , when the pump field strength is larger than some critical value , the atomic cloud scatters constructively the pump photons into the cavity modes .",
    "this causes an abrupt increase of the number of photons inside the cavity , a phenomenon referred to as superradiance , and the atoms achieve self - organization into the effective optical lattice created by the coherent superposition of the pump and cavity fields @xcite .",
    "self - organization breaks the initial translation symmetry .",
    "in other words , photon scattering couples the initial zero - momentum state of the atomic cloud to a superposition of higher recoil momentum states @xcite . this effect has been used to simulate the dicke superradiance quantum phase transition @xcite in a bec - cavity system where two collective motional modes of the condensate play the role of the two hyperfine spin states of the original dicke model @xcite .",
    "the non - equilibrium dynamics of such systems have been studied in @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical proposals have generalized the model even further by introducing cavity - assisted raman coupling in order to reach phases such as self - organized magnetic lattices of bosons @xcite or topologically non - trivial phases of fermions @xcite .    in this article",
    "we consider a two - dimensional system similar to the experiment in @xcite but with two crossing cavities in order to examine the possible formation of self - organized triangular and honeycomb lattices of cold bosons as a result of superradiance . lately",
    ", the honeycomb lattice has attracted a lot of attention in the cold atom community because of its unique band structure mimicking weyl - dirac quasi - particles at the so - called dirac points @xcite . by numerically simulating the real - time dynamics of the cavity - atoms system",
    "we show that , depending on the relative phase @xmath0 of the cavity fields with respect to the pump field , three distinct atomic lattice structures are possible when non - interacting atoms and identical cavities are considered . the first one is a triangular lattice , the cavity fields being in phase with the pump laser ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the second one is a honeycomb lattice with density - balanced sites , the cavities and pump fields being in quadrature ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the last one is a honeycomb lattice with density - imbalanced sites , the relative phase @xmath0 being in between zero and @xmath3 .",

    "we have checked that this difference approaches zero when the cavity damping rates @xmath58 go to zero and the cavities become lossless . another important point to mention is that all the imaginary parts ( positive or negative ) are either two- or four - fold degenerate .",

    "the occasional four - fold degeneracy comes from an additional spatial symmetry of the system : when cavities are identical , the system is reflection - symmetric about axis @xmath4 regardless of the value of @xmath0 , see discussion after eq .  .",

    "this means that the effective potential fluctuates too and thus , in turn , so does the atomic distribution .",
    "in fact , the system needs more time to reach the steady state .",
    "[ fig:0long ] shows the long - time evolution of the system when @xmath160 ( triangular lattice ) .",
    "the steady state is reached around time @xmath203 with a number of cavity photons @xmath204 . in this case",
    "the cavity fields largely dominate over the pump field and the wells of the effective potential organize in a rectangular array rendering the ( exact ) triangular symmetry less apparent as is shown in fig .",

    "the atomic lattice is purely triangular and becomes the stable structure in the long - time regime .",

    "fig : t ] .",
    "note however that the cavity photon numbers take a time longer than @xmath162 to reach their steady - state .             against the cavity phase @xmath0 .",
    "after @xmath162 , atoms have re - organized into the deepest wells of the energy - imbalanced effective potential obtained for @xmath2090,\\pi/2[$ ] and exhibit a triangular lattice structure .",
    "this time @xmath162 increases when the energy mismatch between the principal and secondary potential minima decreases , i.e. when @xmath0 increases .",
    "it diverges when @xmath208 .",
    "the atomic honeycomb lattice obtained at @xmath110 is a stable structure .",
    "[ fig : t],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    when @xmath110 , the effective potential is hexagonal with perfectly energy - balanced minima .",
    "we thus expect a stable density - balanced atomic honeycomb lattice to emerge from the self - organization process . as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : pihalflong ] , this is indeed the case , but the cavity photon numbers now reach their steady - state after a much longer time . they even fluctuate a lot during their temporal evolution and induce in turn fluctuations of the atomic lattice .",
    "these atomic density fluctuations get strongly reduced after the time @xmath210 but , even at time @xmath211 , the system has not yet fully reached its steady - state . as one may have noticed , our numerical results produce different cavity photon numbers @xmath212 even if their average behavior is the same and their asymptotic values are equal .",
    "this asymmetry is due to the sensitivity of this system to numerical errors .",
    "however , the difference in @xmath97 and @xmath98 approaches zero as the system reaches its steady state .",
    "so far , we have considered the dynamical behavior of the cavity - atom system for a fixed pump strength , chosen above the threshold for superradiance , and we have studied the self - organization of atoms into triangular or hexagonal lattice structures for different cavity phases .",
    "we now investigate the possibility of driving atoms from one lattice structure to another by changing in time both the pump strength and the cavity phase .",
    "the protocol we explore is the following .",
    "the pump strength increases linearly in time from @xmath213 to some final value @xmath214 over a certain time window @xmath215 .",
    "meanwhile , the cavity phase is set at @xmath216 initially .",
    "after superradiance takes place and enough number of photons are produced inside the cavities , the phase is then changed linearly in a time interval of @xmath217 to its final value @xmath218 .",
    "finally , the cavity phase keeps this target value for the rest of the time sequence .",
    "we present below the time evolution of the cavity photon numbers and the atomic distribution obtained numerically for this experimental protocol for 3 possible cavity phase values : @xmath160 , @xmath110 and some intermediate value that we choose to be @xmath193 .          when the system starts with @xmath220",
    ", the atoms organize in a triangular lattice . by switching the cavity phase to @xmath221",
    ", a new optical potential is produced featuring additional shallower wells .",
    "however we know from sec .",
    "[ longtime ] that when @xmath206 , the stable structure at long times is the triangular lattice formed by atoms occupying the deepest potential wells .",
    "since atoms have already self - organized in a triangular lattice , changing the cavity phase from @xmath213 to @xmath219 will not affect the atomic distribution which thus remains triangular .",
    "on the other hand , when the system starts instead with @xmath222 and the cavity phase is changed to @xmath223 , the transition to the triangular lattice is inevitable and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi4h-0 ] .",
    "as the cavity phase decreases , the secondary minima of the effective potential obtained for @xmath222 become shallower and shallower and are occupied by less and less atoms .",
    "the triangular lattice becomes the prominent structure around @xmath224 , well before @xmath0 reaches the target value @xmath213 , which triggers a considerable rise of the cavity photon numbers .          in this case ,",
    "both the triangular and density - balanced honeycomb lattices are stable structures of the static situation .",
    "[ fig:0-pihalf ] shows what happens when we start from the triangular lattice ( @xmath220 ) and gradually increase the cavity phase to @xmath225 .",
    "as one expects from the previous case , the atomic lattice structure remains triangular as long as the cavity phase has not reached its target value , @xmath226 .",
    "interestingly enough , once the cavity phase has reached @xmath225 , the atomic density distribution starts to oscillate between the wells of the two triangular sub - lattices of the energy - balanced effective potential , taking the form of density - imbalanced atomic honeycomb lattices in between .",
    "these two triangular sub - lattices are simply shifted by @xmath227 . as a net result",
    ", the atomic density looks like `` blinking '' between two shifted triangular lattices , a sign of a bi - stable behavior .",
    "this blinking does not stop if the pump strength is kept fixed , rather than linearly increasing , after the cavity phase has reached @xmath225 .",
    "it even speeds up if the pump strength is ramped up faster .",
    "the bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig:0-pihalf ] display the atomic densities at times @xmath228 and @xmath229 , showing that , for the experimental parameters chosen , the oscillation period between the two triangular lattices is comparable to the pump recoil time @xmath230 .",
    "it is worth recalling that , once the cavity phase is set to @xmath3 , the minima of the effective potential have same depth and display a honeycomb structure , irrespective of the cavity photon numbers ( as long as they are not zero ) .",
    "this case should not thus be confused with the previous case ( @xmath206 ) where the lattice potential has minima with different depths .",
    "our present results then show that , for time - driven parameters , the density - balanced honeycomb structure is a transient state between two stable triangular structures .",
    "[ fig : pihalf-0 ] shows what trivially happens for the reverse process , i. e. when we start with @xmath231 and decrease gradually the cavity phase to @xmath223 .",
    "once the cavity phase departs from @xmath3 , the effective potential has minima with different depths .",
    "as long as the potential mismatch is weak enough , the initial density - balanced honeycomb structure resists but , with increasing potential mismatch , finally gives in and a density - imbalanced honeycomb lattice is formed around @xmath232 .",
    "then , as the cavity phase decreases further , the depth of the secondary minima , as well as the number of atoms sitting on them , decreases rapidly . before the cavity phase finally reaches @xmath160 at @xmath233 , the atoms choose the deeper triangular sub - lattice which becomes the stable structure as expected .",
    "we address now the last case , namely the transition between the two possible , density - balanced or density - imbalanced , atomic honeycomb lattices .",
    "we first consider switching the cavity phase from @xmath222 to @xmath225 . in this case , some of the atoms are sitting in the shallower potential wells of the effective honeycomb potential while the majority of them are hosted in the deeper ones . by increasing the cavity phase ,",
    "the shallower sites become deeper .",
    "however , the atoms in the deeper wells tend to stay where they are ( see sec .",
    "[ tri - hon1 ] ) until the cavity phase becomes exactly @xmath3 and all potential wells have same depth . at this point ,",
    "the atomic lattice is hexagonal with almost density - balanced sites .",
    "then , for the rest of the time sequence , atoms start oscillating in time between the two stable triangular sub - lattices , featuring the `` lattice blinking '' already observed in the preceding sec .",
    "[ tri - hon2 ] .    when the system starts with @xmath231 ,",
    "the initial atomic lattice is a density - balanced honeycomb lattice .",
    "by gradually decreasing the cavity phase , the potential wells of one of the two triangular sub - lattices become shallower .",
    "however , the initial density - balanced atomic honeycomb lattice resists the potential mismatch even after the cavity phase has reached its final value @xmath195 .",
    "it gets finally destabilized around @xmath234 and takes the form of a density - imbalanced honeycomb lattice , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pihalf - pi4th ] . as explained in sec .",
    "[ longtime ] , this structure is not stable in the long - time limit and destabilizes subsequently into a triangular lattice as the atoms in the shallower sites move to the deeper sites .",
    "in this work we have proposed to load a two - dimensional cloud of non - interacting cold bosonic atoms inside two identical initially - empty optical cavities with an angle of @xmath235 between their axes .",
    "the atoms are driven by an external laser field .",
    "we have given the hamiltonian of this hybrid system in the dispersive regime and we have derived the corresponding dynamical equations in the mean - field regime .",
    "the coherent superposition of the cavity and pump fields creates a dynamical effective lattice potential with a triangular bravais structure in which the atoms move . as a result of superradiance , the atoms",
    "self - organize into a triangular or a honeycomb lattice inside the cavities , the nature of the lattice depending on the relative phase between the pump and the cavity fields . using the symmetry properties of the effective potential ,",
    "we have derived the dynamical equations in reciprocal space and we have investigated the condition required for superradiance to take place .",
    "linear response theory shows that superradiance takes place irrespective of the relative phase between the cavity and pump fields .",
    "this is confirmed by our numerical results : atoms self - organize into a triangular lattice when pump and cavity fields are in phase , into a density - balanced honeycomb lattice when the fields are in quadrature and into a density - imbalanced honeycomb lattice in between .",
    "the stable atomic structures in the long - time limit are the triangular and density - balanced honeycomb lattices .",
    "the density - imbalanced honeycomb lattice only survives for a limited amount of time which becomes longer and longer as the cavity and pump fields approach quadrature . in the end ,",
    "atoms redistribute equally into the triangular sub - lattice made of the deepest potential wells .",
    "we have also studied the transition between these different lattice structures when the relative phase between the fields is dynamically changed and confirmed the stability of the triangular and density - balanced honeycomb structures .",
    "a natural extension of this work would include the study of the survival time of the density - imbalanced honeycomb lattices , the ( possibly chaotic ) dynamics leading to superradiance when the fields are in quadrature and , importantly , the effect of atomic interactions on the self - organization process .",
