    "seed - banks can play an important role in the population genetics of a species , acting as a buffer against evolutionary forces such as random genetic drift and selection as well as environmental variability ( see , e.g. , @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "their presence typically leads to significantly increased genetic variability respectively effective population size ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and could thus be considered as an important `` evolutionary force . '' in particular , classical mechanisms such as fixation and extinction of genes become more complex : genetic types can in principle disappear completely from the _ active _ population at a certain time while returning later due to the germination of seeds or activation of dormant forms .",
    "seed - banks and dormant forms are known for many taxa .",
    "for example , they have been suggested to play an important role in microbial evolution @xcite , where certain bacterial endospores can remain viable for ( in principle arbitrarily ) many generations .    despite the many empirical studies concerned with seed - bank effects , their mathematical modelling in population genetics is still incomplete . yet",
    "probabilistic models , and in particular the kingman coalescent ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and its relatives , have proven to be very useful tools to understand basic principles of population genetics and the interaction of evolutionary forces @xcite .",
    "hence , it is natural to try to incorporate and investigate seed - banks effects in such a probabilistic modelling framework , which is the aim of this article .",
    "before we present our model , we now briefly review some of the mathematical work to date .    in 2001 ,",
    "kaj , krone and lascoux @xcite postulated and studied an extension of the classical wright  fisher model from @xcite that includes seed - banks effects . in their model , each generation consists of a fixed amount of @xmath0 individuals .",
    "each individual chooses its parent a random amount of generations in the past and copies its genetic type . here",
    ", the number of generations that separates each parent and offspring is understood as the time that the offspring spends as a seed or dormant form .",
    "formally , a parent is assigned to each individual in generation @xmath3 by first sampling a random number @xmath4 , which is assumed to be independent and identically distributed for each individual , and then choosing a parent uniformly among the @xmath0 individuals in generation @xmath5 ( note that the case @xmath6 is just the classical wright  fisher model ) .",
    "kaj , krone and lascoux then prove that if the seed - bank age distribution @xmath7 of @xmath4 is restricted to finitely many generations @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is independent of @xmath0 , then the ancestral process induced by the seed - bank model converges , after the usual scaling of time by a factor @xmath0 , to a time changed ( delayed ) kingman coalescent , where the coalescent rates are multiplied by @xmath10 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "an increase of the expected value of the seed - bank age distribution thus further decelerates the coalescent , leading to an increase in the effective population size .",
    "however , as observed by @xcite , since the overall coalescent tree structure is retained , this leaves the relative allele frequencies within a sample unchanged . in this scenario",
    "we thus speak of a `` weak '' seed - bank effect .",
    "more generally , @xcite show that a sufficient condition for convergence to the kingman coalescent ( with the same scaling and delay ) in this setup is that @xmath11<\\infty$ ] with @xmath4 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "a different extension of the model by kaj , krone and lascoux is considered in  @xcite , where the authors combine the seed - bank model of @xcite with fluctuations in population size .",
    "they point out that substantial germ banks with small germination rates may buffer or enhance the effect of the demography .",
    "this indicates that seed - bank effects affect the interplay of evolutionary forces and can have important consequences .    in this respect ,",
    "@xcite show that _ strong _ seed - bank effects can lead to a behaviour which is very different from the kingman coalescent .",
    "in particular , if the seed - bank age distribution is `` heavy - tailed , '' say , @xmath12 , for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a slowly varying function , then if @xmath15 the expected time for the most recent common ancestor is infinite , and if @xmath16 two randomly sampled individuals do not have a common ancestor at all with positive probability . hence , this will not only delay , but actually completely alter the effect of random genetic drift .",
    "it can be argued that such extreme behaviour seems artificial ( although , as mentioned above , bacterial endospores may stay viable for essentially unlimited numbers of generations ) .",
    "instead , one can turn to the case @xmath17 and scale the seed - bank age distribution @xmath7 with @xmath0 in order to understand its interplay with other evolutionary forces on similar scales .",
    "for example , in @xcite and @xcite the authors study a seed - bank model with @xmath18 .",
    "they show that for @xmath19 the ancestral process converges , after rescaling the time by the nonclassical factor @xmath20 , to the kingman coalescent , so that the expected time to the most recent common ancestor is highly elevated in this scenario .",
    "however , in particular since the above seed - bank wright  fisher model is highly non - markovian , the results in other parameter regimes , in particular @xmath21 , are still elusive .    to sum up",
    ", while there are mathematical results in the weak seed - bank regime , it appears as if the `` right '' scaling regimes for stronger seed - bank models , and the potentially new limiting coalescent structures , have not yet been identified .",
    "this is in contrast to many other population genetic models , where the interplay of suitably scaled evolutionary forces ( such as mutation , genetic drift , selection and migration ) often leads to elegant limiting objects , such as the ancestral selection graph @xcite , or the structured coalescent @xcite .",
    "a particular problem is the loss of the markov property in wright  fisher models with long genealogical `` jumps . ''    in this paper",
    ", we thus propose a new markovian wright  fisher type seed - bank model that allows for a clear forward and backward scaling limit interpretation .",
    "in particular , the forward limit in a bi - allelic setup will consist of a pair of ( s)des describing the allele frequency process of our model , while the limiting genealogy , linked by a duality result , is given by an apparently new coalescent structure which we call _ seed - bank coalescent_. in fact , the seed - bank coalescent can be thought of as a structured coalescent of a two island model in a `` weak migration regime , '' in which however coalescences are _ completely blocked _ in one island . despite this simple description ,",
    "the seed - bank coalescent exhibits qualitatively altered genealogical features , both in comparison to the kingman coalescent and the structured coalescent .",
    "in particular , we prove in theorem  [ thmm : notback ] that the seed - bank coalescent `` does not come down from infinity , '' and in theorem  [ tmrca ] that the expected time to the most recent common ancestor of an @xmath1 sample is of asymptotic order @xmath2 as @xmath1 gets large .",
    "interestingly , this latter scale agrees with the one for the bolthausen ",
    "sznitman coalescent identified by goldschmidt and martin @xcite.=-1    summarising , the seed - bank coalescent seems to be an interesting and natural scaling limit for populations in the presence of a `` strong '' seed - bank effect .",
    "in contrast to previous genealogies incorporating ( weak ) seed - bank effects , it is an entirely new coalescent structure and not a time - change of kingman s coalescent , capturing the essence of seed - bank effects in many relevant situations .",
    "we conjecture that the seed - bank coalescent is _ universal _ in the sense that it is likely to arise as the genealogy of other population models , such as moran models with a suitable seed - bank component .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows .    in section  [ sec : wf ]",
    ", we discuss the wright  fisher model with a seed - bank component that has a geometric age structure , and show that its two bi - allelic frequency processes ( for `` active '' individuals and `` seeds '' ) converge to a two - dimensional system of ( s)des .",
    "we derive their _ dual _ process and employ this duality to compute the fixation probabilities as @xmath22 ( in law ) of the system .    in section  [ sec : seedbank_coalescent ]",
    ", we define the _ seed - bank coalescent _ corresponding to the previously derived dual block - counting process and show how it describes the ancestry of the wright  fisher geometric seed - bank model .    in section  [ sec : properties ] , we prove some interesting properties of the seed - bank coalescent , such as `` _ _ not _ _ coming down from infinity '' and asymptotic bounds on the expected time to the most recent common ancestor , which show that genealogical properties of a population in the presence of strong seed - banks are altered qualitatively .    sections  [ sec : seedbank_coalescent ] and [ sec : properties ] may be read essentially independently of section  [ sec : wf ] , thus readers who are interested in the coalescent process only may proceed directly to section  [ sec : seedbank_coalescent ] .",
    "consider a haploid population of fixed size @xmath0 reproducing in fixed discrete generations @xmath23 assume that individuals carry a genetic type from some type - space @xmath24 ( we will later pay special attention to the bi - allelic setup , say @xmath25 , for the forward model ) .    further , assume that the population also sustains a _ seed - bank _ of constant size @xmath26 , which consists of the dormant individuals .",
    "for simplicity , we will frequently refer to the @xmath0 `` active '' individuals as `` plants '' and to the @xmath27 dormant individuals as `` seeds . ''",
    "given @xmath28 , let @xmath29 $ ] such that @xmath30 and set @xmath31 , and assume for convenience that @xmath32 is a natural number ( otherwise replace it by @xmath33 everywhere ) .",

    "the dynamics of our wright  fisher model with strong seed - bank component are then as follows :    * the @xmath0 active individuals ( plants ) from generation 0 produce @xmath35 active individuals in generation 1 by multinomial sampling with equal weights .",
    "* additionally , @xmath36 uniformly ( without replacement ) sampled seeds from the seed - bank of size @xmath27 in generation 0 `` germinate , '' that is , they turn into exactly one active individual in generation 1 each , and leave the seed - bank . * the active individuals from generation 0",
    "are thus replaced by these @xmath37 new active individuals , forming the population of plants in the next generation 1 . * regarding the seed - bank , the @xmath0 active individuals from generation 0",
    "produce @xmath38 seeds by multinomial sampling with equal weights , filling the vacant slots of the seeds that were activated .",
    "* the remaining @xmath39 seeds from generation 0 remain inactive and stay in the seed - bank ( or , equivalently , produce exactly one offspring each , replacing the parent ) . * throughout reproduction , offspring and seeds copy / respectively maintain the genetic type of the parent .",
    "thus , in generation 1 , we have again @xmath0 active individuals and @xmath27 seeds .",
    "this probabilistic mechanism is then to be repeated independently to produce generations @xmath40 note that the offspring distribution of active individuals ( both for the number of plants and for the number of seeds ) is exchangeable within their respective sub - population .",
    "further , one immediately sees that the time that a given seed stays in the seed - bank before becoming active is geometric with success parameter  @xmath41 , while the probability a given plant produces a dormant seed is @xmath42 .",
