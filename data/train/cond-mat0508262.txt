    "the dynamics of a one - dimensional trapped ultra - cold bose gas has attracted considerable attention for last years @xcite .",
    "recently has been achieved regimes where 1d bose gas with a zero - range two - body interaction in the tonks -girardeau ( tg)regime @xcite with fermionic behavior becomes visible .",
    "an investigation of the transition from the mean field regime to the tg regime was performed in @xcite .",
    "experimentally 1d regime has been realized in @xcite .",
    "measurements of the collective oscillations of such a system should give a lot of information about the bec dynamics . in particular",
    "this is important in the analysis of the condensate dynamics in a magnetic waveguide , being a fundamental atom optical element @xcite",
    ". performed by this time theoretical descriptions have mainly dealt with conservative systems , e.g. see @xcite , where collective oscillations of a quasi 1d bose - einstein condensate(bec ) in the low and high density regimes were investigated .",
    "the damping of the radial bec oscillations in a cylindric trap , connected with the parametric resonance and leading to the energy transfer from collective oscillations to longitudinal sound waves has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the dissipation inheres in real systems .",
    "so it is of interest to investigate theoretically effect of damping on collective oscillations of a one - dimensional trapped repulsive bose gas .",
    "we consider here the problem using the phenomenological approach developed by l.p .",

    "the dynamics of a trapped one dimensional repulsive bose gas with the damping is described in the framework of the 1d gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite    @xmath0    with the total number of atoms @xmath1 .",
    "this equation is obtained in the case of a highly anisotropic external potential under the assumption that the transversal trapping potential is harmonic : @xmath2 and @xmath3 under such conditions we can consider the solution of 3d equation to have the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 . averaging in the radial direction ( i.e. integrating over the transversal variables ) we come to equation ( [ gpe ] ) describing the dynamics of the gas in longitudinal direction .",
    "the potential @xmath6 is assumed to be @xmath7 , where @xmath8 describes the time dependence of the potential , which we consider here as @xmath9 .",
    "the effective one dimensional mean field nonlinearity coefficient @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the atomic scattering length .",
    "@xmath12 corresponds to the bose gas with a repulsive interaction between atoms and @xmath13 to an attractive interaction .",
    "we have the following dimensionless form of the equation ( [ gpe ] ) @xmath14 by setting : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 with @xmath19 for the repulsive and attractive two - body interactions respectively .",
    "to describe collective oscillations of a bose gas under damping we employ the variational approach . for the wavefunction @xmath20 we use the gaussian trial function    @xmath21    where a , a , b and @xmath22 are the amplitude , width , chirp and linear phase , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ gpe1 ] ) can be obtained from the variational equations @xmath23 where l is the lagrangian density , @xmath24 , of a conservative system , given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the right side of equation ( [ gpe1 ] ) .    inserting trial function([gaussian ] ) into equation ( [ lagden ] ) and averaging it as @xmath29 we obtain the averaged lagrangian of the conservative system in terms of the trial function parameters : @xmath30    using equation ( [ vareq ] ) and its conjugate , we obtain a system of equations for the variational parameters @xmath31 @xcite : @xmath32    inserting ( [ gaussian ] ) and ( [ avlag ] ) into equation ( [ varpareq ] ) we derive the following system of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) : @xmath33    this system of equations can also be obtained from the modified form of the conservation law for the number of atoms and by using the moments method , as shown in appendix .",
    "let us rewrite the system using the notations @xmath34 : @xmath35    this ode system is the main result of this section .",
    "we have carried out a series of time dependent simulations of the system within the variational approach using equation ( [ rewode ] ) and also by performing exact numerical calculations using equation ( [ gpe1 ] ) . in our numerical calculations",
    "we discretize the problem in a standard way , with the time step @xmath36 , and spatial step @xmath37 , so @xmath38 approximates @xmath39 .",
    "more specifically we approximate the governing equation ( [ gpe1 ] ) with the following semi - implicit crank - nickolson scheme using split - step method @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath45 are defined so that @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 solving ( [ splstep1 ] ) and ( [ splstep2 ] ) first at time @xmath49 we produce intermediate solutions @xmath45 and @xmath50 .",
    "the final solution for one time step dt is obtained from ( [ splstep3 ] ) .",
    "the results of numerical simulations of both pde and ode models are presented below .",
    "figure [ equilstate ] shows time evolution of the width and the norm of the condensate for the case of @xmath51 , i.e. when the external potential has no time perturbations .",
    "the figure is presented to compare the character of the width oscillations and the behavior of the norm depending on the values of the chemical potential @xmath52 and the dissipative constant @xmath53 .",
    "as seen , the frequency of the oscillations does not depend on the dissipative constant at all and depends weakly on the chemical potential , e.g. when @xmath54 , @xmath55 while when @xmath56 , @xmath57 . for greater values of @xmath53 ,",
    "the oscillations damp faster .",
    "we see that the ode leads to an equilibrium state the norm of which is 3 - 4 percent less than that of the pde results .    from figure [ equilstate ] it can be seen that damping process of the condensate eventually leads to the equilibrium state .",
    "this equilibrium state can also be obtained analytically by solving equation ( [ rewode ] ) .",
    "taking into consideration that in an equilibrium state @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 the following expressions can be obtained : @xmath61 putting the value of chemical potential e.g. for @xmath54 we find @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 which are confirmed by the pde results .    in figure",
    "[ norm ] we can observe an interesting behavior of the norm . if an external perturbation is applied to a trapped bec which is already in the equilibrium state then the norm of the condensate starts decreasing . in the figure",
    "the frequency of the periodical trap perturbation is taken to be equal to the eigenfrequency of the system determined from the figure [ equilstate ] and the amplitude of time perturbations is taken as @xmath65 .",
    "we see that for smaller values of the dissipative constant @xmath53 the norm goes farther from the equilibrium state . that is , the dissipative constant is not simply the quantity which is responsible for diminishing the norm , but it is the constant keeping a condensate in the equilibrium state .",
    "the width dynamics under main resonance with the initial wave packet taken in the equilibrium state is depicted in figure [ widthres ] . as shown , in contrast to the norm the width oscillates near the previous point .",
    "as seen from the figure the amplitude of the width oscillations becomes stable by the time @xmath66 .",
    "performing ode and pde calculations for the frequencies which lie around the eigenfrequency of the bec and measuring the amplitudes of the above - said stable oscillations we have plotted the values of the oscillation amplitude as a function of the frequency of the periodical trap perturbations with @xmath67 and @xmath65 in the cases @xmath68 and @xmath69 in figure [ ampfrchar ] .",
    "we see that e.g. when @xmath65 and @xmath69 the highest amplitude of oscillations is driven in the trap perturbation with the frequency @xmath70 which is more than the eigenfrequency @xmath71 .",
    "bistability appears with the smaller values of @xmath53 in the vicinity of this critical frequency .",
    "for @xmath72 we observe large oscillations with @xmath73 , while at @xmath74 we observe much smaller width oscillations with @xmath75 .",
    "it can be seen that with the growth of trap perturbations the value of the critical frequency becomes greater .",
    "let us estimate parameters for the experiment .",
    "the magnetic trap can be taken with parameters @xmath76 hz , @xmath77 hz , and the number of atoms of @xmath78rb @xmath79 .",
    "for the external field @xmath80 , @xmath81 ( repulsive gas ) .",
    "then , the eigenfrequency of the harmonically trapped bec @xmath82 hz . by applying the external perturbation @xmath83 with @xmath84 hz to the trapped bec",
    "one will observe decreasing of the number of atoms by 20 , 13 and 7 percent for @xmath53 = 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.3 respectively .",
    "for the external perturbation with @xmath85 hz , large oscillations will be observed with @xmath86 , while at @xmath87 hz one will observe much smaller oscillations with @xmath88 .",
    "in this paper we study the collective oscillations of a quasi one dimensional bose gas in the presence of dissipative effects .",
    "the modified gross - pitaevskii equation in the framework of the phenomenological approach @xcite has been used . to describe evolution of oscillations",
    "we employ the modified variational approach taking into account the dissipation .",
    "we confirm results for the oscillations damping obtained from the system of equations for the wave function parameters , by the moments method and direct numerical simulations of the full gp equation .",
    "the calculations show that damping oscillations of a bec which eventually comes to an equilibrium state occur with the eigenfrequency which does not depend on the value of the dissipative constant @xmath53 and only depends on the chemical potential @xmath52 .",
    "the expressions for the width and the norm of a condensate in an equilibrium state have been derived analytically .",
    "we study the main resonance in condensate oscillations . for a bec in an equilibrium state it is shown that making the external potential oscillate leads to decreasing of the condensate norm and the norm begins oscillating around the point which is less than the previous stationary one in the equilibrium state , whereas the condensate width oscillates near the previous point .",
    "we have also shown that in resonances the bistability appears with smaller values of the dissipative constant in the vicinity of the critical frequency which is above the eigenfrequency of the bec .",
    "the work was partially supported by a fund for fundamental research support from the uzbek academy of sciences ( award n 17 - 04 ) .",
    "fkha is grateful to the physics department of the university of salerno for the research grant .",
    "differentiating the norm of the condensate by time we can obtain the first equation of the system ( [ rewode ] ) as @xmath89    inserting @xmath90 from equation ( [ gpe1 ] ) into ( [ app1 ] ) we derive the modified form of the conservation law for the norm of the condensate [ 29 ] .",
    "@xmath91 substituting the gaussian trial function ( [ gaussian ] ) into this equation we obtain equation ( [ rewode]a ) .    equations ( [ rewode]b ) and ( [ rewode]c ) can be obtained by the moments method .",
    "we obtain equation ( [ rewode]b ) by calculating @xmath92 the substitution of the @xmath90 from equation ( [ gpe1 ] ) leads to the following equation : @xmath93 substituting trial function ( [ gaussian ] ) we get equation ( [ rewode]b ) . equation ( [ rewode]c ) is derived by calculating @xmath94 integrating by parts and substituting @xmath90 from equation ( [ gpe1 ] ) we obtain @xmath95    inserting the gaussian ansatz into this equation and using results ( [ rewode]a ) and ( [ rewode]b ) we obtain equation ( [ rewode]c ) ."
