    "in the last years , the usage of computational models has turned into a major trend in the discussion of problems in population dynamics and evolutionary theory .",
    "one of the reasons for this choice is undoubtedly the lack of substantial amounts of observational data on the dynamics of such systems ; another , is the ability of computational models in mapping the dynamics of a non - hamiltonian system into a set of simple rules of interaction between the large number of its individual constituents .",
    "simulations of populations evolving under this set of rules serve as grounding test for the theoretical ideas that inspired them",
    ". the outcome of these simulations can then provide support for the role played by each particular conjecture , thus helping the theorist in providing guidelines for her or his work .",
    "statistical physicists have pioneered this effort , and their toolbox has proven its value in a number of different problems - see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews . among the different models that have been used by physicists in the field ,",
    "one stands out for its popularity .",
    "the penna model @xcite owes its leading role to a number of successes , and has further more managed to attract the attention of some theoretical biologists @xcite . despite - or perhaps because of - its simplicity , it has shown enough power to unravel the key factors involved in such phenomena as the catastrophic senescence of semelparous species , female menopause and species branching under ecological pressure .    in the penna model ,",
    "individuals are represented by their genome , mapped onto one ( haploid version ) or two ( diploid version ) bit - strings .",
    "the standard genome used in the penna model is 32-bit long , by no other reason than to turn it easy to implement on 32-bit word processors . in a study of the mortality data of the german population with the penna model , genomes",
    "were represented by 128-bit long strings @xcite .",
    "there , it was shown that it is possible to compare results for two different genome sizes by effecting a rescaling of some parameters .",
    "this result motivated the search for scaling in general , but a first proposal in this direction @xcite was not conclusive .",
    "that computer simulation used an asexual model with a classical verhulst factor and tried to compare directly results with different rescaled parameters .",
    "another version of the asexual penna model , continuous in time and using a real - valued genotype , was also object of a similar analysis @xcite , but its results are not easily mapped onto the usual discrete version .",
    "our approach , as can be seen in the following , is quite different .",
    "we are interested in studying the sensitivity of the penna model for diploid individuals , that use sex for reproduction , with respect to the number of bits used in the implementation of the age - structured genetic load , and we focus on the analysis of the age distribution of the population .    in the penna model , each position ( locus ) of the genome may contain a bit set to @xmath0 ( harmful allele ) or @xmath1 .",
    "the passage of time in an individual s life triggers the activation of one further allele in the sequentially read bit - string .",
    "the amount of active harmful alleles determine the genetic death of the individual when it reaches some pre - determined threshold value . an individual may also die because of intra - specific competition for resources of the environment , and this is usually represented by a density - dependent mean - field death probability , called the verhulst factor .",
    "a fortran code that simulates the model , and was the basis for our own simulations , can be found in ref .",
    "because the genome is age - structured , from a physical point of view we are studying the properties of the model s temporal scaling .",
    "the biological aspect of our analysis is to provide an answer to the question whether the model shows dependence on the genome size .    as a first step",
    ", we have looked for the model version more suited to the analysis and chose a variation of the version with a verhulst factor that operates only on the first time step of an individual s life @xcite .",
    "since this usage of the verhulst factor is equivalent to setting the reproduction probability dependent on the population size , we made it explicitly by letting a female give birth with a probability given by @xmath0 minus the verhulst factor . with this choice , we are able to control the population in a way that is not dependent on the genome length , due to the fact that a living individual never feels the effect of an external death factor . in the version with the usual verhulst strategy ,",
    "each living individual has an yearly probability to die , and the effective non - genetic death probability is trivially dependent on the genome size .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_age ] we show the age distribution of the population for various simulations of the model , differing by the number of bits in the genome . in the figure we are showing just the normalised values of the age distributions , forgetting the fact that the population grows with genomes elongation .",
    "the first model uses a string of 32 bits . because 32 is a natural unit for these computational studies running on 32-bit word processors ,",
    "the other bit strings are chosen with sizes multiple of this number : 64 , 96 , 192 and 224 bits .",
    "in all the simulations performed , the parameters that control the number of dominant loci , the age at which reproduction starts , the number of offspring and mutations in each generation , and the threshold of harmful mutations are exactly the same .",
    "it is also relevant to notice that the cross - over frequency during gamete production is always one in each of these simulations .",
    "the end of reproduction age is different for each genome length , in each case set to correspond to the maximum allowable age of the individuals ( 32 , 64 , 96 , 192 or 224 ) .",
    "in fact , our simulation conditions permit autosustaining populations that at equilibrium are not very sensitive to a change of this parameter .",
    "so , our choice does not introduce any undesirable asymmetry .",
    "we can see that the distributions , although qualitatively similar , undergo a visible differentiation .",
    "we were led by their aspect to look for a scaling law that gives a relation between two different ages ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) at which the integral of two distributions corresponding to different genome sizes ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) reach the same population value .",
    "formally , we search for a temporal rescaling @xmath6 that solves the equation    @xmath7    the solution turns out to be a very simple linear relation . in all cases ,",
    "the integral of the distribution , as a function of its upper limit , starts with a linear growth , at ages where the distribution is essentially constant , and ends with a saturation , at the end of the lifespan of the population .",
    "this behaviour suggests that a linear relation between the time values may satisfy the integral equality : if @xmath8 is a regression of the linear part of the integral function of the distribution @xmath9 , @xmath10 leads to the relation we are looking for :    @xmath11    each index , @xmath12 or @xmath13 , is defined as the bit string size divided by @xmath14 .",
    "we can determine the coefficients of this rescaling relation by performing the regression of each integral function and using the above derived formulae to compute @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "for simplicity of notation , we omit the first index if it is equal to @xmath0 .",
    "table [ indices ] shows results for these coefficients for some values of @xmath13 and for @xmath17 .",
    "these simple transformation relations allow both a proper rescaling of the full integral functions , and not only of its linear part , and also a rescaling of the age distributions .",
    "in fact , if we perform the inverse of the time transformations with the coefficients in table [ indices ] and then renormalise the rescaled functions , we obtain results that are close to the 32-bits distribution from all the others ( see fig . [ fig_rsca ] ) .",
    "+ from the coefficients listed in table [ indices ] it is possible to suggest a simple approximation for the slopes of the time rescaling transformations :    @xmath18 . \\label{law}\\ ] ]    these coefficients are physically related to the model s temporal scaling , as already pointed out .",
    "a similar relation also holds for the terms @xmath19 , which are obtained as a difference between the constant terms of the regressions of the integral functions rescaled by a slope , and thus depend on the values of the age distributions at zero age .",
    "we now compare the mortality functions , derived from the age distributions by the equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the value of the distribution at age @xmath22 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_mort ] these functions are plotted , after having rescaled the age distributions . in a linear scale , these functions appear to collapse for young ages , and they diverge clearly at the large age end .",
    "the inset , on a log - linear scale , shows that the mortality functions have the same general behaviour in the small age interval shown , but the plot shows an increasing separation between the smaller and larger genomes .",
    "the collapse is not fully obtained , as can be seen with the help of the error bars shown .",
    "+ the slope of the scaling transformation is obviously strongly dependent on the values of the simulation parameters .",
    "of particular interest is a choice of these parameters that leads to a unit slope . in this case",
    ", we may recover the solution of the 32-bits model from the others just by rescaling those parameters , which amounts to performing a renormalisation . to explore this alternate path ,",
    "we have focused our attention on just two of the parameters , namely the number of dominant loci for the harmful allele and the number of mutations added in each generation .",
    "the guideline here was to keep constant the density of mutations and dominant loci in the genomes , independently of their size .",
    "we only need to multiply the original values of these parameters in the 32-bits model by @xmath12 , the genome size divided by 32 .",
    "the results of this renormalisation procedure are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_norm ] .",
    "from the results of our numerical simulations it emerges that , given a penna model with a verhulst factor acting a single time in each individual s life , the scaling laws :    @xmath23 t+ [ 0.5 \\cdot ( j-1 ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ \\rho & \\longrightarrow & [ 1 + 0.5 \\cdot ( j-1)]^{-1}\\rho \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the number of bits in the genome and @xmath13 an integer , lead to age distribution functions @xmath25 that have similar behaviours , although they do not agree quantitatively for all genome sizes .",
    "this fact allows one to use any genome size in a simulation , if only qualitative features are focused , from which the age distribution for all other sizes can be roughly derived .",
    "it is also known that the situation is no more clearer if the threshold for harmful mutations is scaled in proportion to the genome size @xcite .    as a final comment ,",
    "our results seem to indicate that the onset of ageing , usually considered as coincident with the minimum reproduction age , is now , for large genomes , deferred .",
    "the age distributions do show a decreasing trend , starting close to the onset of reproduction , but they have very small derivatives - reflected on the plateau at small ages for the mortality functions .",
    "the lifespan of the population increases linearly with genome size , as opposed to being strongly dependent only on the minimum reproduction age . the latter prediction is usually considered to be a trivial consequence of the mutation accumulation theory on which the penna model is based .",
    "these results are somewhat intriguing and deserve further investigation .",
