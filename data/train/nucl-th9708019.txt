    "proton - proton bremsstrahlung is one of the simplest processes that can be used to extract information on the off - shell nucleon - nucleon t - matrix from experiments .",
    "the off - shell interaction lies at the basis of most calculations on nuclear properties . to extract this interaction from the data it is imperative that all competing effects are under control .",
    "elsewhere the effects of meson - exchange currents , isobar components and relativity have been considered@xcite . in this letter",
    "we want to address another competing mechanism , that of off - shell effects in the electromagnetic nucleon vertex .",
    "the problem of off - shell form factors in the @xmath0 vertex has been faced in different ways . in one",
    "approach@xcite one uses dispersion integrals to relate the imaginary part of the vertex , arising from inelastic processes , to the real part which now obtains an explicit dependence on the invariant mass of the nucleon .",
    "an alternative approach@xcite is to dress the vertex explicitly with one - loop corrections . also from chiral perturbation theory estimates",
    "can be obtained on the dependence of the off - shell form factor near the on - shell point@xcite .",
    "the different approaches give considerable differences in their predictions .",
    "for this reason we propose a parametrization of the off - shell form factor based on a low - energy behaviour .",
    "we investigate effects of off - shell form factors on observables in proton - proton bremsstrahlung using the fully relativistic framework developed in ref@xcite .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon t - matrix is calculated in a blankenbecler - sugar approximation by j. fleischer and j.a .",
    "the effects of the form factor on observables are discussed in terms of the coefficients of our parametrization and the effects ( for realistic parameters ) are found to be large .",
    "the most general structure of the nucleon - nucleon electromagnetic vertex for the real photon reads@xcite : - matrices and @xmath1 @xmath2 or equivalently _ ( w , w^)=e_+i_kl=0,1 ^k ^la_kl(w^2,w^2 ) , where @xmath3 is the proton charge ( mass ) , @xmath4 is the anomalous magnetic moment . in the formulas above the initial ( final )",
    "proton has momentum @xmath5 is photon momentum , @xmath6 .",
    "the operators @xmath7 project on positive- and negative - energy states of the off - shell proton with invariant mass @xmath8 . the functions @xmath9 or @xmath10 are the electromagnetic off - shell form factors of the nucleon .",
    "time reversal requires symmetries among the form factors , @xmath11 . from the equivalence of and one deduces immediately that f^rs = a_00+r w a_10+s w^a_01+rsw w^ a_11 , r , s=+,-  , where @xmath12 are functions of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 thus obey the following symmetry relation f^rs(w , w^)=f^++(r w , s w^ ) .",
    "therefore , it suffies to know @xmath16 only .    in our bremsstrahlung calculations we are interested in photon energies up to 150 mev .",
    "although this region extends beyond the applicability of low - energy theorems , one may still use a low - energy expansion to determine the most important aspects of off - shell form factors . from a low - energy expansion of the bremsstrahlung matrix element around the on - shell point ( @xmath17 )",
    "one finds that the leading order contribution is determined by two parameters : the slope k = .",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 at the on - shell point , ^- = f^+-(m , m)=f^-+(m , m ) .",
    "henceforth , we will use the values for @xmath20 and @xmath21 to compare the different models for off - shell form factors . in all our calculations",
    "the experimental value for the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton will be used , @xmath22 .",
    "we will also impose that eq.(1 ) reproduces the standard electromagnetic vertex with all the particles on - shell and thus @xmath23 .",
    "one approach to calculate off - shell form factors is through the application of dispersion relations@xcite .",
    "the real part of a form factor is related to the integral of the imaginary part which in turn is related to a total cross section by unitarity .",
    "this should give a model independent estimate of the form factor .",
    "however , for the evaluation of the integral the cross section at very high energies is required , which is unknown .",
    "related to this , the convergence of the dispersion integral is unclear and several subtractions may be necessary .",
    "these unknowns are reflected in a rather large range of values deduced for @xmath20 and @xmath24 .",
    "threshold dominance assumption was adopted in refs.@xcite to compute imaginary parts of the form factors .",
    "it led to the values @xmath25 and @xmath26 in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite instead @xmath27 was obtained .",
    "the value of @xmath20 is not given in this reference , but seems considerably larger than the value quoted in@xcite . if more sutractions are needed to make the dispersion integrals convergent , even these values are not predicted anymore@xcite .    a self - consistent model for the form factors near the on - shell point can be obtained from next - to - leading - order chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the isovector part of @xmath28 was calculated@xcite to be equal to 2 , with the isoscalar part being negligible in the chiral limit .",
    "this approach does not predict @xmath29 .    near",
    "the on - shell point one expects that off - shell corrections to the vertex are calculable in a one loop model .",
    "naus and j.h .",
    "koch did calculations with a dominant contribution from the one - pion loop @xcite , where the pseudoscalar pion - nucleon coupling was used .",
    "values @xmath30 and @xmath31 are inferred from this model .",
    "another qualitative model was developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "there , the loop comprises nucleon and a `` dressing '' scalar meson of mass 0.8 gev .",
    "this model predicts values @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "a more realistic approach including the vector dominance model was presented by p.c .",
    "tiemeijer and j.a .",
    "tjon @xcite .",
    "it leads to @xmath34 for the pseudoscalar coupling and @xmath35 for the pseudovector one .",
    "( the value of @xmath29 is not presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in an analogous framework @xcite also the delta degree of freedom was included in the one - pion loop .",
    "this model gives rise to values of approximately zero for both @xmath28 and @xmath36 .",
    "the main conclusion we draw from this short overview of the results on the form factors is that a consensus is lacking .",
    "for this reason we have adopted an _",
    "ad hoc _ parametrization of the form factors , based on the low energy expansion , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 as parameters .",
    "as was shown above , it is enough to parametrize the form factor @xmath37 only , @xmath38 the constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 are easily expressed through the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 discussed above : @xmath41 .",
    "the exponential decreasing factor was included to provide that the form factors do not grow like @xmath42 at infinity . at the value of the constant @xmath43 used in the calculations , @xmath44 ,",
    "this exponent is of a minor importance for the observables ( see discussion of the results below ) .",
    "since the values of @xmath20 and @xmath45 differ considerably for the various approaches to the form factors , we performed calculations for two different choices of the parameters ( please note that @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 corresponds to ignoring all off - shell dependence ) ;    * @xmath49 , @xmath50 . for this choice of parameters",
    "the role of the negative energy states is emphasized since near the on - shell point @xmath51 is not affected but @xmath52 and @xmath53 are .",
    "this parametrization will be referred to as `` @xmath54 '' and is close to that following from the one - loop model of reference @xcite .",
    "* @xmath55 , @xmath56 . for this case",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment for negative- and positive - energy states is the same , but with a linear dependence on the invariant mass near the on - shell point .",
    "this parametrization is thus referred to as `` @xmath57 '' .",
    "the value @xmath58 is taken from the chiral perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "since this model does not predict @xmath29 , we put @xmath59 in order to reduce the number of independent parameters and to make it complementary to the previous choice .",
    "10 cm    in the calculations we used the approach developed in ref.@xcite , based on a fully relativistic t - matrix of ref.@xcite in which a complete account is given of relativistic effects .",
    "the rescattering contribution was included in the calculations , which was shown to be crucial for a correct treatment of negative - energy states .",
    "corrections due to meson - exchange currents and the isobar degree of freedom were not included . these are not important for investigating the influence of possible off - shell effects , but will be for a definitive comparison with the data .",
    "fig.1 shows that the off - shell effects change the cross section up to @xmath60 15% for the @xmath61-case and @xmath60 30% for the @xmath62-case .",
    "the effect is even larger for the analyzing power at a wide range of photon angles .",
    "corrections are seen of the order of @xmath60 30% for the @xmath63- and @xmath60 25% for the @xmath62-calculations .",
    "we checked the effect of the parameter @xmath43 as well .",
    "increasing @xmath43 has negligible effects on the observables : less than 2% for d varying from 0.5 to 1000 .",
    "the latter value corresponds to the practical absence of the exponent in the parametrization of the form factors",
    ".    13 cm    to investigate whether the off - shell effects found are due to the one - boson - exchange kernel or they originate from the full complexity of the t - matrix , we calculated the cross section with and without the off - shell corrections within a one - boson - exchange model including @xmath64 and @xmath65 mesons .",
    "the coupling constants were taken the same as in the kernel of the t - matrix .",
    "the result for the cross section is shown in fig .",
    "2 ( the analyzing power is zero in the one - boson - exchange model ) .",
    "it is seen that the effects are of the same order of magnitude as in the full calculations . in detail",
    "there are however large differences , while in the full calculations the effects of @xmath21 are large , the opposite is found in the obe - calculations .    to obtain a better understanding of these off - shell effects",
    "we have investiated them in a low - energy approach .",
    "the low - energy theorem for the bremsstrahlung processes @xcite states that in the expansion of the cross section in the small energy @xmath66 of the radiated photon , = + _ 1+q_2+q^2_3 + , the terms @xmath67 and @xmath68 are uniquely determined .",
    "it means that any off - shell effects may contribute only to the coefficients @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and terms of higher order in @xmath66 . within the one - boson - exchange model",
    ", we investigated analytically the @xmath71-dependence of the difference @xmath72 between cross sections with and without the off - shell corrections . in a low energy expansion of @xmath72",
    ", we were retaining only leading orders in @xmath66 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 being the general notation for the initial and final proton three momenta .",
    "the leading off - shell contribution was found to be proportional to @xmath66 for both the @xmath61 and @xmath54 cases , i.e. @xmath75 , in accordance with .",
    "let @xmath76 denote a part of @xmath72 that comes from the exchange of a particular @xmath77 .",
    "we found that for every meson , @xmath78 is proportional to @xmath71 . more specifically , for the @xmath61-case of parametrization , the ratio @xmath79 . for the @xmath54-case , the @xmath80-meson dominates , with @xmath81 , depending on photon angle . at the same time , @xmath82 for the @xmath61 and @xmath54-cases are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "since the contributions of the different mesons add constructively for the @xmath61-case , after summing up all the mesons , @xmath83 in the @xmath61-case is much larger than @xmath83 in the @xmath54-case as also seen in fig.2 .",
    "these features can be explained as follows .",
    "the @xmath84-coupling contains only the vector part , and it can be shown that the vector part of the meson - nucleon coupling leads to the same @xmath76 for both @xmath61 and @xmath54 . the tensor part of the @xmath85-coupling plays different roles for positive- and negative- energies , which causes the apparent difference in contributions from the @xmath86-meson for the calculations with @xmath61- and @xmath54-parametrizations .    10 cm    for a proper description of the off - shell effects in the electromagnetic vertex it is necessary to include the rescattering contributions .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "3 , where the dependence is shown of @xmath72 on the photon energy for the calculations based on the full t - matrix .",
    "these calculations were done at @xmath87 mev and photon angle @xmath88 .",
    "the photon energy was varied by changing the ( equal ) angles of the outgoing protons from @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "comparing the full calculations for the @xmath54 and @xmath61 cases , we see that at low photon energies the off - shell effect coming form the negative - energy part of the vertex is much smaller than that from the positive - energy part , which is consistent with our findings in the one - boson - exchange model and appears to be due to the smallness of the @xmath80-exchange contribution for the full result .",
    "eventhough in the present calculations rescattering gives a similar suppresion of the effect in negative - energy states as that of ref.@xcite , the situation is qualitatively different here . in ref.@xcite",
    "the effect of negative - energy states in the convection current was studied , where current concervation was shown to put strong constraints on the leading order effect . in our case",
    "the magnetic part of the vertex is addressed , where arguments based on current concervation do not apply .",
    "inspite of this , still the rescattering contribution is responsible for a strong cancellation of the effect of negative - energy states . at the same time , the contributions to @xmath72 from negative- and positive - energies are comparable with each other when the photon energy becomes larger than 100 mev / c , which corresponds to the kinematics in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "it also follows from fig .",
    "3 that no contribution of the off - shellness shows up either in the constant @xmath68 or in the singular term @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( 8) , which implies that the calculations fulfill the low - energy theorem .",
    "we also did similar calculations for @xmath92 mev ( not shown here ) .",
    "we found that the off - shell effects on the observables are larger , but only by at most a factor 1.5 , compared to the calculations at @xmath87 mev .    in conclusion , we investigated the effects of the off - shell electromagnetic structure of the nucleon on observables in proton - proton bremsstrahlung .",
    "we used a parametrization of the nucleon electromagnetic off - shell form factors based on its general properties and with values consistent with model calculations .",
    "we found a sizable influence of these off - shell effects on the observables , in particular on the analyzing power .",
    "we thank a.yu . korchin for valuable discussions concerning off - shell effects at low energies .",
