    "loop quantum gravity @xcite is a candidate for a non - perturbative and background independent quantization of general relativity which by now has uncovered several crucial features relevant at small length scales .",
    "most importantly , it unambiguously leads to discreteness of spatial geometry at the planck scale @xcite which has played crucial roles in physical pictures studied so far , such as cosmological and black hole singularities @xcite .",
    "these applications , however , also require a significant amount of dynamical aspects which remain poorly understood and quite complex in a full setting .",
    "many applications have therefore been formulated in symmetric models of loop quantum cosmology @xcite , which is a reduction preserving crucial properties such as the very discreteness of the full theory but at the same time making calculations explicitly treatable .",
    "results concerning new behavior at small scales then indeed follow at least qualitatively as direct consequences of such basic properties related to discreteness .",
    "as homogeneous models in this framework are becoming studied in more and more detail , initially designed structures have to be refined .",
    "in particular , inhomogeneities are the crucial ingredient for most remaining open issues .",
    "while background independence is conceptually important and crucial for basic properties exploited in loop applications , it also makes more detailed derivations of physical properties complicated .",
    "a relation between quantum and classical geometry is needed for nearly every aspect considered in quantum gravity such as the singularity issue ( where a relation to classical geometry is required in identifying states where a classical singularity would occur ) or corrections to cosmological structure formation .",
    "while full quantum geometry as it occurs at a fundamental level provides many advanced techniques , a direct use usually comes with too much baggage for a given application .",
    "additional specializations to pick the right regime are often required .",
    "examples are symmetric states in considerations of singularities , or boundary conditions for black hole entropy calculations @xcite and in recent attempts to make contact with low energy scattering @xcite .",
    "one is thus often led to introduce special states corresponding to the physical situation at hand , which allows one to make a detailed relation to classical properties .",
    "these states , in turn , provide useful background structures . as has been demonstrated by now in many investigations , characteristic properties of the background independent framework remain intact even when such additional structures are introduced to extract and focus on physical regimes of interest .",
    "such a narrowing - down is a technical step to perform explicit calculations or to find suitable approximation schemes , rather than a conceptual part of the underlying theory .",
    "given the complexity as well as incompleteness of the full framework , a systematic derivation of dynamics of such sectors from the full theory is currently difficult , but many qualitative and semi - quantitative aspects can be studied in carefully designed models . if such restrictions are not made , immense technical difficulties have to be faced . for cosmological perturbation theory for instance",
    "the averaging problem @xcite , which is even difficult in classical gravity , arises while difficulties relevant for the singularity problem have been described in @xcite .",
    "the aim is certainly to arrive , at some point , at a complete relation to , if not a derivation from , a fully background independent theory .",
    "but such a derivation as well as the construction of the full theory itself will be much easier if likely properties are already known and have been evaluated in simpler situations .",
    "an inclusion of inhomogeneous degrees of freedom in applications is currently under construction , and already available for midisuperspace models @xcite and in perturbative form @xcite . from these developments",
    "it is becoming clear that properties of inhomogeneous degrees of freedom have a bearing also on strictly homogeneous models .",
    "while the overall findings in the homogeneous case are confirmed , the inhomogeneous analysis suggests changes in constructions which one would not necessarily have considered from within those models .",
    "a relation between homogeneous and inhomogeneous models can in particular influence what is seen as natural or unnatural in the constructions , and which corrections should be expected to dominate .",
    "we will discuss here basic properties of quantum variables used in loop models , and draw four conclusions regarding parameters of isotropic models when they are viewed as arising from inhomogeneous ones .",
    "the setting we mainly have in mind is that of perturbative inhomogeneities and thus refer particularly to the behavior of models when they describe larger universes rather than regimes close to classical singularities .",
    "most of our observations , however , will be general and can be checked non - perturbatively in midi - superspace models , although they are justified by the specific formulation introduced here only in regimes of perturbative inhomogeneities .",
    "we will also discuss technical details of symmetry reductions , suggest a new picture for how metric modes on a background geometry such as gravitons arise effectively through collective quantum excitations , and indicate the possibility of quantum corrections to the universe evolution at large scales .",
    "a classical isotropic model is fully described by the scale factor @xmath0 as a solution to the friedmann equation once the matter content is specified . in ashtekar variables @xcite on which loop quantum gravity is based the scale factor and its time derivative are expressed through a densitized triad component @xmath1 with @xmath2 , determining an isotropic densitized triad @xmath3 , and a connection variable @xmath4 , determining an isotropic connection @xmath5 @xcite ( with the barbero  immirzi parameter @xmath6 @xcite relating the ashtekar connection to extrinsic curvature ) .",
    "the densitized triad encodes spatial geometry as it is related to the spatial metric by @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , the spatial volume of a region @xmath8 is @xmath9 which for an isotropic triad reduces to @xmath10 where the coordinate volume @xmath11 is absorbed in @xmath12 .",
    "the re - scaled variable @xmath12 , and similarly @xmath13 , is then independent of coordinates in contrast to @xmath1 or the commonly used scale factor @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it does , however , depend on the coordinate size @xmath11 of the region integrated over which can be fixed to be the total space in a closed model but needs to be chosen in open models where integrations have to be restricted to finite regions .",
    "the relation of basic variables to metric or connection components then depends on which choice is being made here .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath11 will not appear explicitly when one restricts oneself to the variables @xmath15 and @xmath12 only , for instance the poisson relations @xmath16 become independent of @xmath11 after rescaling : @xmath17    following the loop quantization , these basic objects are represented on a hilbert space with an orthonormal basis @xmath18 of states given as functions of the connection component by @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "exponentials @xmath20 , analogous to holonomies of the full theory , then act by multiplication , @xmath21 and the triad component @xmath12 by a derivative , @xmath22 this demonstrates how basic properties of the full theory are preserved : only exponentials of @xmath15 are represented while it is not possible to obtain an operator for an individual component @xmath15 directly , and the triad operator @xmath23 has a discrete spectrum since its eigenstates are normalizable . from @xmath23",
    "one directly obtains the volume operator @xmath24 .    using the basic operators one then has to construct more complicated ones relevant for dynamics . for matter hamiltonians , inverse triad components such as @xmath25",
    "are required which can not simply be obtained by taking an inverse operator of @xmath23 because this inverse does not exist : @xmath23 has a discrete spectrum containing zero .",
    "nonetheless , one can construct operators corresponding to the classical inverse using poisson identities such as @xcite @xmath26 for @xmath27 and some @xmath28 . on the right hand side , only a positive power of @xmath12 is required which is easily available upon quantization .",
    "the poisson bracket will then become a commutator , resulting in a well - defined and for isotropic models even bounded operator @xcite .",
    "the main effect is that inverse powers of @xmath12 occuring in classical equations are replaced by regular functions , which can be read off from eigenvalues of the operators of the form @xmath29 .",
    "for instance , in a scalar matter hamiltonian , @xmath30 occurs in the kinetic term which is replaced by a regular function @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ambiguity parameter above and @xmath33 with a second parameter @xmath34 arising when one rewrites expressions in a form mimicking su(2 ) holonomies of the full theory , where one can choose an irreducible representation for holonomies .",
    "matrix elements in a representation @xmath34 will then be of the form of exponentials used above with exponents between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the value in ( [ bracket ] ) corresponding to the fundamental representation @xmath37 .",
    "this procedure results in an effective density of the form @xmath38 with @xcite @xmath39    similarly , the gravitational part of the friedmann equation requires reformulations because it contains terms linear and quadratic in @xmath15 while only exponentials of @xmath40 , i.e.  almost periodic functions of @xmath15 , can be quantized .",
    "thus , the classical expressions will be replaced by a function which reduces to the classical one for small @xmath15 , i.e.  small extrinsic curvature in a flat model , while giving corrections at larger curvature .",
    "this usually also involves free parameters as in the simplest case of choosing @xmath41 in parallel with full constructions @xcite , this can be understood as arising from the trace of a holonomy of @xmath42 around a square loop whose edges are integral curves of symmetry generators @xmath43 .",
    "the square loop holonomy for edges along directions @xmath44 and @xmath45 is of the form @xmath46 which , when appearing in a suitable trace , gives rise to a single term @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 then determines the ratio of the coordinate length of an edge of the loop to @xmath48 , and it appears in the holonomy through @xmath49 which has matrix elements @xmath50 for an isotropic connection . on top of that , one can again choose non - fundamental representations for holonomies with the effect of multiplying @xmath28 with a spin label @xmath34 @xcite .    in the poisson brackets ( [ bracket ] ) as well as in replacements ( [ holonomy ] ) for polynomials in @xmath15 we use holonomies such that it appears most natural to use the same value for @xmath28 here .",
    "its value remains undetermined , but the order of magnitude has been estimated by relating it to the lowest eigenvalue of the full area operator , corresponding to the area of a square loop used in such a basic dynamical move @xcite .",
    "the argument is , however , incomplete because the area operator is used to fix a parameter of the reduced constraint although it does not appear in the full one as it is formulated now .",
    "it seems against the general viewpoint of loop quantum cosmology , formulated e.g.  in @xcite , to invoke the area operator to quantize curvature components in a model while it does not occur in the full constraint .",
    "moreover , the coordinate area relevant for the loop in holonomies is different from the geometrical area quantized by the area operator .",
    "these construction steps give rise to quantum corrections of different types to classical equations , and also to several parameters to choose which are ultimately to be related to the full theory .",
    "open questions in this context concern the relative magnitude of correction terms , obtained through modifications such as those in ( [ pl ] ) or ( [ holonomy ] ) in effective equations @xcite , with respect to each other , which is important to know for the construction of realistic scenarios , and natural ranges of the parameters . while these open issues can be avoided to some degree by sufficiently general arguments such as those for singularity removal @xcite or phenomenology @xcite , there are additional problems some of which have become visible recently :    * the parameter @xmath34 labels an su(2 ) representation that needs to be chosen for the construction of inverse triad operators and is sometimes taken to be significantly larger than @xmath51 which would be the lowest allowed value corresponding to the fundamental representation .",
    "this permits one to remain well in a semiclassical regime while still having sizable quantum effects",
    ". it also justifies , when used only in inverse power corrections ( [ inveigen ] ) , to ignore other correction terms coming from holonomies in ( [ holonomy ] ) because they are much smaller in such regimes .",
    "it is thus meaningful for technical purposes to work with larger values of @xmath34 and analyze corresponding effects .",
    "but it looks `` unnatural '' that the representation label should be large , rather than just the value for the fundamental representation , or that different corrections should use different @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , there are arguments related to a type of quantum stability @xcite or the physical inner product @xcite which may indicate that the fundamental representation at least for holonomy corrections ( [ holonomy ] ) is indeed preferred by internal consistency .",
    "but by appropriate sums of operators involving different @xmath34 .",
    "] * in the construction of the dynamical equations one has to replace ploynomials in @xmath15 by functions depending on exponentials .",
    "this is justified when @xmath15 is small in a semiclassical situation , while close to classical singularities there can be strong differences between such functions which are indeed expected when classical gravity breaks down . however , the isotropic connection component @xmath15 can even become large in semiclassical regimes where one would not expect strong quantum effects .",
    "this is the case whenever there is a positive cosmological constant for which the connection component behaves as @xmath52 .",
    "thus , even if @xmath53 is small , @xmath54 will grow without bound and eventually lead to a large @xmath55 ( see sec .",
    "4.3 of @xcite and @xcite for an early and a more recent discussion ) .",
    "similar effects , depending on initial values , may occur in anisotropic models @xcite .",
    "* in a flat model we have to choose a cell of coordinate size @xmath11 , or a compactification to a torus of the same size .",
    "this is just auxiliary in flat models while its value is fixed in closed ones .",
    "however , this value appears in equations through @xmath56 and in physical quantities such as the scale at which a bounce may occur @xcite .",
    "this is because the rescaled variables @xmath12 and @xmath15 , while they are not coordinate dependent , depend on the value of @xmath11 entering in the rescaling .",
    "these effects have been recognized and in some cases ameliorated by amendments introduced in isotropic models .",
    "for instance , the issue in the presence of a cosmological constant can be resolved if one chooses @xmath28 not as a constant but as a @xmath12-dependent function @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "if , e.g. , @xmath58 at large scales , @xmath15 is always small in semiclassical regimes .",
    "moreover , such a choice can remove the @xmath11-dependence from the bounce scale resulting from holonomy corrections @xcite . however , while such a choice is not inconsistent with quantization procedures , homogeneous models can not justify it convincingly . as with @xmath28 ,",
    "one is invoking the area operator although it does not appear in current versions of the full constraint .",
    "moreover , the resulting operator for curvature components becomes triad - dependent which is not realized in the full theory either .",
    "we will demonstrate in what follows that the intuition behind those modifications is nonetheless borne out by lattice constructions .",
    "in fact , isotropic loop quantum cosmology was originally developed for models which exhibit typical effects close to classical singularities in order to see how quantum corrections can lead to better classical behavior . in the meantime , the resulting singularity removal mechanism has been extended non - trivially to inhomogeneous models @xcite .",
    "this was successful because for this aspect a single spatial patch is already quite typical and thus homogeneous models are reliable ( while isotropy itself would be too special ; see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these models were not intended to be taken too seriously for quantitative aspects at larger scales .",
    "although the universe is homogeneous on such scales to a high degree , the classical continuum picture requires space to be made of many `` atoms '' in a discrete world .",
    "thus , at the quantum level one must not ignore inhomogeneities especially when the universe becomes large .",
    "some of the above difficulties arise precisely from taking isotropic models literally at large scales .",
    "one can clearly see this for the cosmological constant , which implies a large integrated trace of extrinsic curvature just because space becomes large .",
    "this is the case even if the local curvature scale remains small in a semiclassical regime .",
    "while homogeneous models do not allow much choice in basic variables , which will include some form of the total extrinsic curvature , inhomogeneous models are built on more local objects .",
    "a better situation can then be expected if inhomogeneous models are used where basic variables remain small in semiclassical regimes .",
    "the full theory in current form has several different complications not all of which are related to inhomogeneities as they arise as modes on a background .",
    "configuration variables are holonomies associated with arbitary curves in space , whose values allow one to distinguish between all connections relevant for general relativity . since the connection takes values in su(2 ) , holonomies are elements of the group su(2 ) .",
    "their matrix elements are multiplication operators in the basic representation of loop quantum gravity built on states which are gauge invariant products of holonomies associated with edges of arbitrary spatial graphs @xcite . while these graphs visualize the discrete spatial structure of quantum geometry , they can be arbitrarily fine and no explicit short - scale cut - off is present in the theory .",
    "graphs can also be of any topology ( knotted or linked ) and can have vertices of high valence . while holonomies implement the connection as basic operators , spatial geometry is given by triads , the conjugate momenta .",
    "they are quantized to flux operators , associated with 2-surfaces in space , which take non - zero contributions only from intersection points between the surface and edges of the graph acted on by the flux operator .",
    "their spectra are discrete , further implementing the spatial discreteness of quantum geometry .",
    "these basic operators appear in more complicated ones relevant for dynamics , such as matter hamiltonians for which inverse triad operators are necessary and the gravitational hamiltonian constraint .",
    "while such operators can be constructed in well - defined manners @xcite , their actions are highly involved on arbitrary states .",
    "moreover , in particular the gravitational constraint usually changes the graph underlying a state it acts on because holonomies around closed loops are used to quantize curvature components . unless such loops are lying entirely on the original graph of a state ,",
    "the action creates new edges and new vertices leading to a finer graph .",
    "it is a success , however , that such operators can be defined in a well - defined manner at all , considering that their analogs in quantum field theory on a curved background space - time would suffer from several infinities .",
    "this is one of the places where background independence and the quantum representation it leads to are crucial and imply characteristic properties of resulting theories . as noted before , there is no explicit short - scale cut - off in the theory .",
    "finiteness rather results from the fact that hamiltonian operators act on graph states , and each such graph implies a non - local representation of the classical fields .",
    "in addition to the hamiltonian constraint , there is the diffeomorphism constraint which is implemented as finite diffeomorphisms moving graphs in space .",
    "solving it implies that invariant results are independent of the embedding of graphs in space .",
    "most or all of this freedom needs to be fixed when calculations are to be done using a background geometry for a particular physical regime . in the full setting , this can be achieved by picking suitable semi - classical states peaked at a geometry corresponding to the desired background ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this way , the full background independent framework is used but special states are selected to pick a regime , making use of an additional ( background ) structure .",
    "in addition to the classical background , such states depend on typical quantum aspects such as the spread of a state or parameters describing the typical fineness of graphs used and thus encoding discrete spatial aspects .    unfortunately , there are conceptual and technical difficulties in even defining suitable semiclassical states , and working with them at this level is highly involved .",
    "one of the difficulties is , for instance , that holonomies are su(2)-valued which requires the use of lenghty re - coupling identities in doing explicit calculations . on the other hand , results are rarely sensitive to all aspects and can often be reproduced with a high level of accuracy in simpler constructions ( compare , e.g. , @xcite with @xcite ) .",
    "we will now devise a model which allows one to formulate a suitably explicit framework for perturbative inhomogeneities and other inhomogeneous regimes such as the bkl picture , maintaining the characteristic properties of a background independent quantization .      to capture significant inhomogeneous ingredients we introduce regular lattice states with spacing @xmath59 measured in background",
    "coordinates assumed to be flat .",
    "the motivation is to analyze implications of typical aspects of the full theory such as the fact that states are based on graphs and properties of hamiltonian operators .",
    "this will allow one to read off characteristic modifications to classical expressions which can then be transferred to effective equations .",
    "lattice links are parts of integral curves of a basis of symmetry generators of the background , which also provides an orientation of all edges .",
    "although it is not necessary for inhomogeneous states , we assume this lattice to be in a cell of finite size @xmath11 for comparison with homogeneous models .",
    "the number of lattice blocks and vertices is then @xmath60 .",
    "lattices of this type are special cases of fundamental states , but we also make use of background structures to be introduced in the construction .",
    "this renders the usual floating lattice of a background independent fundamental description into a rigid one on a background , suitable , e.g. , for cosmological considerations . by explicitly introducing a background in this manner we bypass more involved reformulations which would define a background through relational objects , akin to relational solutions of the problem of time .",
    "usually , spin network states are built on graphs , labeled by su(2 ) representations on edges and contraction matrices in vertices in order to multiply all holonomies , evaluated in the labeling representation , to a gauge invariant function of the connection .",
    "this changes when the construction is used on a background , for instance a homogeneous one where integral curves of killing vector fields define the lattice links . for a perturbative treatment of inhomogeneities classical variables of the form @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "are suitable where the densitized triad and the first part of the connection are diagonal .",
    "a diagonal densitized triad is obtained by a gauge choice ( such as scalar modes in longitudinal gauge ) making use of the background around which one perturbs .",
    "the connection can not be completely diagonal , however , because this would violate the gauss constraint in an inhomogeneous situation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the non - diagonal part containing @xmath63 comes from the spin connection which is determined completely in terms of @xmath64 , and possibly spatial derivatives of the shift vector if it is not zero in the chosen gauge .",
    "the independent degree of freedom @xmath65 in the connection thus appears in diagonal form ( in gauges where the shift vector vanishes this corresponds to extrinsic curvature ; otherwise there is an additional contribution to the non - diagonal connection part ) .",
    "in fact , we have conjugate fields @xmath65 and @xmath66 , with @xmath67 taking only the diagonal part of @xmath68 , holonomies along links are of the form @xmath69 in direction @xmath44 .",
    "the diagonal form of basic variables implies that not all the freedom of an su(2 ) theory has to be dealt with , effectively abelianizing the framework as in homogeneous models @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can consider higher representations of su(2 ) such that , in the @xmath34-representation , a holonomy has matrix elements @xmath70 and lower powers .",
    "independent functions on the space of lattice connections are thus labeled by integers @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the vertex position and @xmath73 the direction of the link starting from the vertex using the orientation of symmetry generators as tangent vectors to links .",
    "such functions are then of the form @xmath74 . in homogeneous models ,",
    "one uses real labels @xmath75 for representations of the bohr compactification of the real line , which can be seen as arising from a degeneracy between representation labels and edge length @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath76 are then used in isotropic models , which separate the space of isotropic connections .",
    "using integer labels on a fixed lattice states does not allow us to separate all classical connections , but this is not required because choosing a lattice means that only functions of a certain scale are being probed .",
    "at this point , we have assumed diagonal metrics also at the inhomogeneous level which effectively abelianizes the theory : instead of su(2 ) calculations we simply work with u(1 ) , i.e.  we can replace complicated su(2 ) recoupling relations by multiplications of phases .",
    "this is the reason why we do not need to introduce vertex labels because abelian holonomies are uniquely multiplied to gauge - invariant functions . although the diagonalization is a truncation of the classical theory , it allows full access to perturbative inhomogeneous degrees of freedom realized classically .",
    "this is also the key reason for simplifications that makes it possible to do explicit calculations .",
    "since this corresponds to a field theory for classical variables @xmath77 and @xmath65 , we have many more basic operators which are nevertheless constructed very similarly to those of isotropic models .",
    "holonomies along lattice links @xmath78 are of the form @xmath79 absorbing @xmath59 in @xmath80 , and fluxes through lattice sites @xmath81 perpendicular to an edge @xmath78 as in fig .  [ flux ]",
    "are given by @xmath82 .",
    "compared to isotropic models , @xmath48 is thus replaced by @xmath59 and the lattice spacing takes over the role of the cell size .",
    "now all expressions are dependent on @xmath59 , but this has meaning as the lattice size , although it is just the size measured in background coordinates .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath59 is not just an auxiliary quantity because it is thought of as arising from a fundamental state after re - introducing a background rather than being introduced to discretize a theory by hand .",
    "poisson relations between holonomies and fluxes introduced here follow , e.g. , from a mode decomposition @xmath83 of the fields @xmath65 and @xmath84 on a symmetric background which we still assume to be flat for simplicity . with our box of size @xmath11 ,",
    "all components of the wave numbers @xmath85 summed over are @xmath86 with positive integers @xmath87 .",
    "from @xmath88 we obtain poisson brackets @xmath89 between the modes .",
    "link integrals of the connection and fluxes then become @xmath90 and @xmath91 where the values of indices @xmath92 and @xmath93 are defined such that @xmath94 .",
    "thus , @xmath95 using fourier series leads to the appearance of characteristic functions @xmath96 centered at @xmath97 of width @xmath59 . restricted to vertices on a lattice of spacing @xmath59 , this",
    "is identical to @xmath98 .",
    ", width=264 ]    when quantized , holonomies will again become multiplication operators latexmath:[\\[\\hat{h}_{i,{v}}|\\ldots,\\mu_{i,{v}},\\ldots\\rangle =    acting on a state . note that we do not use a parameter like @xmath28 since edges of the link size are distinguished and multiplying with holonomies for edges not integer multiples of lattice links does not preserve the lattice structure .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 is thus an integer , simply corresponding to the choice of representation of holonomies . for basic holonomies , @xmath100 .",
    "flux operators latexmath:[\\[\\hat{f}_{i,{v } } |\\ldots,\\mu_{i,{v}},\\ldots\\rangle=    \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma{l_{\\mathrm p}}^2\\mu_{i,{v } }    orthogonal to an edge in direction @xmath44 have eigenvalues proportional to @xmath71 or , when we take a surface intersected by the vertex @xmath72 , proportional to the average of labels of neighboring edges , @xmath102 denotes the vertex next to @xmath72 along the edge @xmath78 , i.e.  the endpoint of @xmath78 other than @xmath72 .",
    "these labels then determine the volume eigenvalues . from @xmath103",
    "the volume operator is defined as @xmath104 with eigenvalues @xmath105 in the form @xmath106 , rather than one global contribution as in ( [ inveigen ] ) . also , as noted before these functions",
    "do not contain @xmath28 since the link size is fixed . by the same calculations used to derive @xmath56 in the isotropic case , such functions have peaks at values @xmath107 , or @xmath108 for an arbitrary irreducible representation , corresponding to @xmath109 .",
    "this is similar to the isotropic case , but now @xmath110 distinguishes different regimes according to @xmath111 or @xmath112 rather than inequalities for the isotropic @xmath113 .",
    "so also here , @xmath11 has been replaced by the smaller @xmath59 .",
    "having reviewed isotropic basic variables and introduced analogous ones for inhomogeneous lattice states we can draw conclusions regarding their relation .",
    "most of these effects are qualitatively true for any inhomogeneities , but are made explicit in lattice models introduced here .      as noted before , coordinate background structures to define homogeneity or the choice of lattices in inhomogeneous states introduce parameters such as the cell volume @xmath11 or the lattice spacing @xmath59 .",
    "the parameters then occur in derived expressions , and such expressions change when other choices for the parameters are made .",
    "since the parameters are related to coordinates or the embedding of structures in space , it is not always guaranteed that such a rescaling freedom makes physical sense .",
    "indeed , for @xmath11 this is not the case which is one of the difficulties in purely homogeneous models .",
    "ratios such as @xmath114 which demarcate classical from quantum behavior , where @xmath115 is a characteristic scale appearing in the construction of operators and @xmath75 a state label , depend on @xmath11 through @xmath12 .",
    "( factors of @xmath11 do not cancel since @xmath110 is defined independently of @xmath11 . )",
    "the situation is , however , different for @xmath59 which replaces @xmath11 in elementary expressions when lattice states are used .",
    "although @xmath11 is still present , it always appears in combination with @xmath59 through @xmath116 .",
    "then , ratios as before take the form @xmath117 which is @xmath59-dependent .",
    "but unlike @xmath11 , changing @xmath59 has physical meaning because we then change the scale on which we probe space by the lattice .",
    "if we choose a bigger lattice spacing , i.e.  enlarge @xmath59 , @xmath1 will have to drop to even smaller values for quantum corrections to become noticeable .",
    "since both @xmath59 and @xmath1 are coordinate dependent , this statement about the relation between changing @xmath59 and corresponding changes in @xmath1 is invariant under rescaling of coordinates .",
    "this happens in such a way that the change of @xmath59 implies physical properties that are expected .",
    "isotropic models show similar technical features , but due to additional backgrounds involved they are not as physically convincing .",
    "these observations also indicate that the triad scale at which quantum effects become important in inverse powers does not only depend on a representation label chosen for the quantization of inverse triad operators but also on the lattice size .",
    "in fact , choosing finer lattices has the same effect as choosing higher representations on a lattice of unchanged size .",
    "the importance of such effects is determined by ratios @xmath118 where @xmath12 is a flux value and @xmath110 is proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "technically , this ratio can be made small by choosing larger @xmath34 , or by making the relevant fluxes take on smaller values in the same situation . in homogeneous settings",
    "one only has the first option , while inhomogeneous ones easily allow the second one by choosing smaller surfaces for integrating fluxes .",
    "in fact , if the geometry is nearly isotropic , we can use the average value @xmath119 to make contact with isotorpic variables .",
    "now , as discussed at the end of the preceding section , quantum corrections start to become noticeable when @xmath120 , or @xmath121 which is enhanced by a factor depending on the number of vertices",
    ". note that we did not use higher representations for holonomies in commutators , by which one can achieve a similar effect if @xmath122 . the enhancement comes just from the fact that for individual links it is the local value of @xmath1 rather than the total one which is relevant .",
    "this observation brings us to the next point , which is the naturalness or unnaturalness , or even consistency , of using higher representations of holonomies to construct operators . as we have seen , in inhomogeneous systems one can achieve the same effect by using finer lattices which is certainly a legitimate way to change parameters .",
    "while this is not available in homogeneous models , using higher spins there may simply be seen as a way to mimic inhomogeneous behavior in such a setting .",
    "there is no direct relation between all features of homogeneous models to the full theory because of degeneracies : changing very different ingredients of an inhomogeneous situation can result in the same change in a homogeneous model .",
    "the higher spin compared to the lattice size is one such example , where in earlier papers only the direct relation identifying a higher representation in a homogeneous model with a higher representation in the full theory has been made .",
    "if this is the only way to relate higher spins to properties of the full theory , it certainly makes higher spins in homogeneous models look unnatural .",
    "the relation to the lattice spacing , overlooked so far , makes using higher representations much more natural in homogeneous models , while inhomogeneous ones can still be formulated by restricting oneself to the fundamental representation in composite operators .    along similar lines one can justify using different spins for gravitational and matter parts in a hamiltonian constraint as effective means to include inhomogeneous features .",
    "even if we use higher spins in homogeneous models , one may still question why one should use different ones in holonomies in a matter hamiltonian compared to the gravitational part of the constraint .",
    "such different spins are often helpful to bring out matter corrections as the dominant ones since they are most easy to derive and to work with .",
    "the relation to lattice spacing suggests a reason for higher spins in matter terms compared to gravitational ones : it simply means that for matter terms we use longer range `` interactions '' based on holonomies which extend through several vertices rather than just one basic lattice link .",
    "this is an option one clearly has in any lattice model , for which loop quantum gravity is one example .",
    "if one accepts such longer range interactions , one is led directly to the behavior also resulting from higher spins in a homogeneous model .",
    "in addition to ratios @xmath118 relevant for inverse triad operators , connection components entering holonomies are the second variable which determines where quantum corrections become noticeable . in isotropic models",
    ", @xmath123 has to be small compared to one for the classical constraint as a polynomial in @xmath15 to be a good approximation of functions of exponentials @xmath124 used for the quantization .",
    "as noted before , however , in the presence of a cosmological constant @xmath15 can become arbitrarily large even in classical regimes ( while @xmath28 has been argued to be of order one by comparing with the lowest area eigenvalue @xcite ) .    in inhomogeneous lattice models ,",
    "holonomies appearing in composite operators are associated with links and of the form @xmath125 where we introduced the isotropic @xmath13 for comparison .",
    "what has to be small is thus not @xmath126 but @xmath127 which can be achieved by having a large number of vertices even if @xmath15 does not become small .",
    "a large number of vertices is in fact what one expects if a universe grows to larger size because the fundamental hamiltonian of loop quantum gravity most likely creates new vertices in its action @xcite .",
    "the creation of new vertices is not easily incorporated in a regular lattice model , although it is possible , but one can view regular lattices as a coarse - grained , effective description of the fundamental one . for this , no explicit mechanism is required : for effective equations we can compute expansion coefficients locally on a given lattice with @xmath116 vertices . in those coefficients ,",
    "metric values appear depending on @xmath116 .",
    "parametrically , @xmath116 can then be assumed to be a function of the total volume or scale factor whose precise behavior is to be determined by a more detailed formulation .",
    "this is analogous to a mean field approximation where `` fast '' modes are treated only effectively by correction terms . here",
    ", vertices are created at each step of the action of the constraint operator implying planck - size changes in the local geometry .",
    "this degree of freedom is thus much faster than semiclassical effects we are mainly interested in here , i.e.  it happens on much smaller time scales ( measured in terms of the global geometry ) .",
    "then , as the total volume increases one should also adapt the lattice size and increase @xmath116 .",
    "this is in particular the case when one has a positive cosmological constant because the universe grows without bound .",
    "as the scale factor @xmath54 increases and @xmath128 increases , also @xmath116 has to increase . for a well - behaved semiclassical state",
    "this has to happen in such a way that @xmath129 , the argument of holonomies , remains small which is easily achieved in an inhomogeneous model .",
    "the validity of a homogeneous model , on the other hand , will break down at a certain volume , which is one example where homogeneous approximations are good on small scales but not at large ones .",
    "we can draw one further conclusion related to this observation . in link holonomies",
    "we have the quantity @xmath127 compared to the isotropic @xmath126 with a constant @xmath28 . in inhomogeneous situations",
    ", @xmath28 does not appear at all , and there is thus no indication for the makeshift argument relating @xmath28 to the area spectrum used in the absence of a relation to inhomogeneity .",
    "this agrees with the fact that the full constraint operator does not contain the area operator .",
    "curvature components of the constraint are rather quantized directly through holonomies , which is also realized here with natural loops provided by the lattice . moreover , if @xmath130 is not treated as a constant , we can resolve problems at large scales .",
    "this can be modeled in a purely isotropic situation by letting @xmath28 be scale - dependent in a form @xmath131 at large scales , corresponding to the number of vertices growing linearly with volume , latexmath:[$n\\propto    isotropic models to counter large scale and other problems @xcite .",
    "while one might question a non - constant @xmath28 in isotropic models on the grounds that holonomies would have to depend on triad variables , the relation to the number of vertices in inhomogeneous states clearly provides convincing justification for it . in general , however , the behavior may differ from @xmath133 which is to be checked in detailed models implementing the subdivision .",
    "there are also conceptual differences between the arguments for @xmath134 in isotropic models and those presented here : while in isotropic models the parameter arises at the operator level and leads to holonomies in the constraint depending on triad components , lattice models implement a volume dependence through states . this is closer to the full theory where it is the state - dependent regularization of the hamiltonian constraint that determines how new edges and vertices are created .",
    "nevertheless , it is promising and encouraging for other constructions in models that independent considerations in homogeneous and inhomogeneous settings lead to the same qualitative conclusions .",
    "finally , we discuss the relative size of different quantum corrections arising from quantum hamiltonians .",
    "the main corrections are from inverse triad operators , where the size of @xmath12 is relevant , and holonomies where @xmath15 is relevant . while @xmath12 has to be sufficiently _ small _ for inverse triad corrections to become large , @xmath15 has to be _ large _ for large holonomy corrections . for evaluations of effective equations @xcite it is then helpful to know if there is any correction which dominates , or if all of them have to be taken together which would make the analysis more complicated . in any model ,",
    "an answer to this question depends on which regime one is looking at , and the situation in homogeneous models is undecided .",
    "irrespective of what the answer in a particular homogeneous scenario is , however , the situation is different in inhomogeneous models . as before",
    ", inhomogeneity implies that for local operators appearing in composite ones connections are integrated only over small links and triads only over lattice sites rather than all of space .",
    "thus , the connection values relevant for holonomies and the triad values for fluxes are both significantly reduced compared to the values that appear in homogenous operators . as a consequence , inverse triad corrections will become _ more prominent _ while holonomy corrections will be _ less so_. main effects are then to be expected from inverse triad corrections of quantum geometry , as they have been studied several times in homogeneous models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "besides these technical observations we can also draw more general conclusions .",
    "symmetric states are obtained by restricting full states to a subset of invariant connections relevant for a symmetric model @xcite .",
    "such states are necessarily distributional in the less symmetric situation , and general operators will not leave the space of such states invariant .",
    "nevertheless , one can derive all basic operators given by holonomies and fluxes of the symmetric model from corresponding ones in the full theory .",
    "this is sufficient to derive the quantum representation of models from the unique one in the full theory @xcite .",
    "since many properties of loop quantizations , including those discussed here , follow already from basic aspects the derivation of the basic representation is a crucial step .",
    "explicit examples for such constructions can be found for reducing an anisotropic model to an isotropic one in @xcite and for obtaining the spherically symmetric representation from the full one in @xcite . a more general discussion is given in @xcite .",
    "we can use the constructions presented here to shed more light on the role of inhomogeneities in these reductions .",
    "a general lattice state is of the form @xmath135= \\prod_{i,{v } } h_{i,{v}}^{\\mu_{i,{v}}}= \\langle k_j(x)|\\ldots,\\mu_{i,{v}},\\ldots\\rangle\\ ] ] with @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "this corresponds to an isotropic connection @xmath55 if @xmath138 , or @xmath139 , for all @xmath44 and @xmath97 . the restriction of the state then becomes the isotropic state @xmath140 following the general procedure , there is a map @xmath141 taking an isotropic state of the reduced model to a distributional state @xmath142 in the inhomogeneous setting such that @xmath143 where the inner product on the right hand side is taken in the isotropic hilbert space , using the restricted state @xmath144 as an isotropic state ( [ restricted ] ) .",
    "link holonomies as multiplication operators simply reduce to multiplication operators on isotropic states .",
    "fluxes for lattice sites , however , do not map isotropic states to other isotropic ones .",
    "this can easily be seen using @xmath145 on states @xmath146 which have non - zero labels only on one lattice link @xmath78 .",
    "we then have @xmath147 since the flux surface and the non - trivial link do not intersect in the second case .",
    "however , @xmath148 for any isotropic state @xmath149 .",
    "thus , @xmath150 can not be a superposition of isotropic distributional states , and flux operators associated with a single link do not map the space of isotropic states to itself .",
    "( the above formulas show that @xmath151 can not be contained in a decomposition of @xmath150 in basis states , but we can repeat the arguments with arbitrary values for the non - zero label in @xmath152 . )    instead , one can use extended fluxes which are closer to homogeneous expressions .",
    "first , we extend a lattice site flux @xmath153 to span through a whole plane in the lattice , leading to @xmath154 .",
    "this corresponds to a homogeneous flux in the box of size @xmath11 but is still not translationally invariant because the plane @xmath155 is distinguished .",
    "we can make it homogeneous on the lattice by averaging along the direction @xmath44 transversal to the plane .",
    "this leads to a sum over all lattice vertices in @xmath156 including a factor @xmath157 from averaging in one direction .",
    "finally , we take the directional average @xmath158 to define the isotropic flux operator .    now , to find the action of this operator on a distributional state @xmath149 we compute @xmath159 where @xmath75 is defined in terms of @xmath71 as in ( [ restricted ] ) .",
    "this agrees with the isotropic flux operator defined in isotropic models , @xmath160 and shows in particular that @xmath23 , unlike @xmath161 , maps an isotropic distribution to another such state .",
    "thus , the isotropic representation in loop quantum cosmology follows from the inhomogeneous one along the lines of a symmetry reduction at the quantum level .",
    "notice that this leads directly to an operator for @xmath12 rather than @xmath1 without explicitly introducing the cell size @xmath11 .",
    "we just extend fluxes over the whole lattice in order to make them homogeneous , such that the combination @xmath162 automatically arises .      on inhomogeneous lattice states",
    "we can look for representations of inhomogeneous excitations of geometry .",
    "classically , such excitations are given by modes of a metric perturbation @xmath163 on a background @xmath164 . in a perturbative quantization on that background",
    ", @xmath165 would thus be the basic field to be quantized , leading to the expectation of one - particle states called gravitons corresponding to transverse - traceless modes of @xmath165 .    in loop quantum gravity ,",
    "the situation is different because its basic formulation is background independent .",
    "having formulated here a lattice description as a sector which re - introduces a metric background , we can see how such metric perturbations are realized .",
    "simplifications due to abelianization used here also occur in constructions of explicit states in linearized gravity @xcite .",
    "as in the full theory , basic excitations of the loop quantization are given by dynamical moves which change the labels @xmath71 locally at a vertex to @xmath166 .",
    "this changes the local labels , corresponding to inhomogeneous modes , but also the total volume corresponding to the background volume of @xmath164 . a quantum analog of the mode can be defined as the difference @xmath167 between local labels and the average volume which captures properties of the classical modes even at the level of effective dynamics @xcite .",
    "the quantum picture of these excitation is then very different from the classical one : @xmath168 arises non - locally since we have to sum over the whole lattice to subtract off the background .",
    "basic dynamical moves of the quantum theory change the local quantum excitation as well as the background , leading to a mode change also in a non - local way . in this picture ,",
    "metric modes such as gravitons arise as collective excitations out of the underlying lattice formulation : many basic quantum modes combine to give classical excitations .",
    "quantum expressions differing from their classical analogs give rise to corrections to classical equations .",
    "this usually occurs on small length or large curvature scales as they are realized in the very early universe . but",
    "subdivision in a lattice also makes relevant local length scales smaller , and indeed we already noticed that inverse power corrections as functions of @xmath169 become dominant over holonomy corrections because the flux values are reduced on lattice links if the lattice becomes finer .",
    "this opens the possibility for small corrections on single lattice sites to add up to sizeable corrections on the whole lattice , which can influence the evolution of modes @xcite or even of the whole universe .",
    "models of loop quantum gravity are being investigated actively regarding their phenomenological properties , and perturbative inhomogeneities are currently being included .",
    "this brings us closer to reliable computations of potentially observable properties such as those of structure formation .",
    "it is then important to check all intrinsic details of such models and see how faithfully they incorporate features of the full theory .",
    "as we discussed , qualitative effects are realized in homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous lattice models in the same way .",
    "we introduced inhomogeneous lattice constructions in a way which allows for a relation to a homogeneous background .",
    "the relation to isotropic models is then clear , which provides a new step toward relating isotropic models to the full theory .",
    "although the lattice construction is analogous to that of isotropic models , quantitative aspects can change which has a bearing on which ranges of parameters one considers as natural or unnatural .",
    "it also plays a role for which correction terms will be dominant in different regimes which is the most important aspect for phenomenological investigations .",
    "the lattices used here are not intended as fundamental descriptions since they are not background independent .",
    "they are rather to be thought of as effective lattice models which result if some degrees of freedom of the full theory are interpreted as providing a background for other degrees of freedom .",
    "this simplifies the more irregular fundamental behavior .",
    "it is this feature which helps to illustrate and clarify some puzzling properties realized in isotropic models .",
    "there are also further applications such as explicit constructions of quantum field theories on a quantum spacetime as suggested in @xcite , more general models for field propagation with quantum corrections based on @xcite , or cosmological perturbations @xcite .",
    "such lattice models are more accessible for a relation to the full theory and can thus be used to suggest relevant properties which one wants to ensure in future constructions and specifications of the full theory at a basic level .    for now , the construction already presents several applications .",
    "they all rely on the re - introduction of a background which is necessary to interpret computational results .",
    "we focused here on kinematical aspects , but an inclusion of characteristic dynamical ones is in progress . for a detailed description of all effects expected in fully inhomogeneous settings ,",
    "remaining difficulties are an explicit treatment of subdivision and the inclusion of non - abelian properties .",
    "but this is not required explicitly for effective perturbations where the lattice description discussed here is sufficient .",
    "it allows one to derive perturbation equations for metric modes around the background , to be used for instance for cosmological structure formation , or to understand the emergence of graviton states conceptually .",
    "_ note added : _ after this paper had been submitted to the journal general relativity and gravitation , the preprint gr - qc/0607100 by kristina giesel and thomas thiemann was posted .",
    "although the conceptual setup is quite different from the approach followed here , it is clear that there is a convergence of different ideas pursued recently in loop quantum gravity . especially in combination with the results of sec .",
