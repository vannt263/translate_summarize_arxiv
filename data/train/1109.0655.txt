    "this proposal has been accomplished by deriving a time - dependent master equation which leads to a decoherence - free evolving superposition state which can be nonadiabatically controlled by the system - reservoir parameters . in the present contribution",
    "we have provided a general recipe to engineer arbitrary effective reservoirs for a fermionic system by manipulating its interaction with a bosonic mode .",
    "more specifically , we showed how to protect a superposition state of a two - level ion trapped into a leaky cavity .",
    "the robustness of our scheme was analyzed by means of the fidelity considering the case where the protected state does not depend on time , as well as the case of slowly and rapidly time varying evolutions .",
    "to support the approximations used to derive our analytical results , we have numerically solved the full master equation , obtaining an excellent agreement with the approximations we have carried out . in the present contribution we also analyzed the temperature effects of the reservoirs on the fidelity of the static and time varying protected states .",
    "we concluded that the temperature is the most important source of decoherence in our present protocol .",
    "we hope that this contribution can be useful for information processing with trapped ions inside optical cavities , for example for implementing deutsch algorithm @xcite or universal dissipative quantum computing @xcite .",
