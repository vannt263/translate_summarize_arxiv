    "recent advances in femtosecond laser technology have made possible the investigation of electron transfer processes at solid surfaces , which are known to be the basis for many fundamental steps in surface photochemistry and ultrafast chemical reactions.@xcite these are typically atomic and molecular adsorption processes and catalytic reactions between different chemical species , which transfer energy from the reaction complex into the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom of the solid substrate .",
    "these reactions may induce elementary excitations , such as quantized lattice vibrations ( phonons ) , collective electronic excitations ( plasmons ) , and electron - hole ( e - h ) pairs . in metals",
    ", the excitation of e - h pairs leads to an excited or _ hot _ electron with energy above the fermi level @xmath0 and to an excited or _ hot _ hole with energy below @xmath0 .",
    "it is precisely the coupling of these hot carriers with the underlying substrate which governs the cross sections and branching ratios of electronically induced adsorbate reactions at metal surfaces .",
    "it is the intent of this review to discuss the current status of the rapidly growing field of the dynamics of _ hot _ carriers in metals .",
    "the energy relaxation of these hot electrons and holes is almost exclusively attributed to the inelastic scattering with _ cold _ electrons below the fermi level ( e - e scattering ) and with phonons ( e - ph scattering ) , since radiative recombination of e - h pairs may be neglected .",
    "assuming that the excess energy of the hot carrier is much larger than the thermal energy @xmath1 , the e - e scattering rate does not depend on temperature .",
    "furthermore , for excitation energies larger than @xmath2 inelastic lifetimes are dominated by e - e scattering , e - ph interactions being in general of minor importance . only at energies closer to the fermi level , where the e - e inelastic lifetime increases rapidly , does e - ph scattering become important.@xcite    different techniques have recently become available for measuring hot - carrier lifetimes .",
    "inverse photoemission ( ipe)@xcite and high resolution angle resolved photoemission ( arpe)@xcite provide an indirect access to the lifetime of hot electrons and holes , respectively , by measuring the energetic broadening of transition lines after impigning an electron ( ipe ) or a photon ( arpe ) into the solid .",
    "an alternative to ipe is two - photon photoemission ( 2ppe),@xcite in which a first ( pump ) photon excites an electron from below the fermi level to an intermediate state in the energy region @xmath3 from where a second ( probe ) photon brings the electron to the final state above the vacuum level @xmath4 .",
    "this technique can also be used to acces the lifetime of the intermediate state directly in the time domain ( time - resolved 2ppe),@xcite by measuring the decrease of the signal as the probe pulse is delayed with respect to the pump pulse .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that lifetime measurements of electrons and holes in metals can be done by exploiting the capabilities of scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and spectroscopy ( sts),@xcite and ballistic electron emission spectroscopy ( bees ) has also shown to be capable of determining hot - electron relaxation times in solid materials.@xcite applications of these techniques include not only measurements of the scattering rates of hot carriers in solids , but also measurements of the lifetime of shockley and image - potential states at metal surfaces.@xcite    the early theoretical investigations of inelastic lifetimes and mean free paths of both low - energy electrons in bulk materials and image - potential states at metal surfaces have been described in previous reviews,@xcite showing that they strongly depend on the details of the electronic band structure.@xcite nevertheless , although accurate measurements of inelastic lifetimes date back to the mid 1990 s , the first band - structure calculations of the e - e scattering in solids were not carried out until a few years ago.@xcite    here we outline theoretical formulations of the hot - electron lifetime that is due to the inelastic scattering of the excited _ quasiparticle _ with occupied states below the fermi level .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the study of electron scattering processes in the framework of time - dependent perturbation theory",
    ". a discussion of the main factors that determine the decay of excited states is presented in section 3 , together with a review of the existing theoretical investigations of the lifetime of hot electrons in the bulk of a variety of metals .",

    "shockley surface states are known to be localized near the topmost atomic layer . however , image states are mainly localized outside the solid .",
    "therefore , image states are expected to be weakly coupled with available bulk states above the fermi level and to live much longer than excited bulk states with the same energy : while the rpa broadening ( or linewidth ) @xmath43 of a bulk state at the energy of the @xmath72 image state on cu(111 ) ( @xmath73 ) is found to be @xmath74 , the @xmath72 image - state linewidth is reduced to @xmath75.@xcite    coupling of the image state with the crystal occurs through the decay into bulk unoccupied states lying below the bottom of the projected band gap ( which yields a linewidth of @xmath76 ) and also through the decay into the unoccupied part of the @xmath71 shockley surface state lying within the projected band gap ( which leads to a linewidth of @xmath77 ) .",

    "this is due to the presence of a projected band gap at the surface , which in the case of cu(111 ) reduces considerably the phase space available for real transitions of the @xmath72 image state into bulk unoccupied states .",
    "this considerable reduction of the available phase space for real transitions does not occur in the case of cu(100 ) ; this explains the known fact that although the penetration of the @xmath72 image state on cu(100 ) is approximately 4 times smaller than in the case of cu(111 ) the ratio between the linewidths of the @xmath72 image state on the ( 111 ) and ( 100 ) surfaces of cu is smaller than 2.@xcite      in the case of simple metals that can be described by a uniform free - electron gas of density @xmath81 , which is characterized by the density parameter @xmath82 , a careful analysis of the phase space available for the creation of e - h pairs yields a decay rate of hot electrons with energies near the fermi level ( @xmath83 ) of the form@xcite @xmath84 furthermore , in the high - density limit ( @xmath85 ) , eqs .",

    "is known to increase .",

    "however , eq .  ( [ limit2 ] ) shows that this is not the case .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is twofold . on the one hand , due to momentum and energy conservation",
    "the number of states available for real transitions in metals is typically weakly dependent on the actual electron density . on the other hand , as the electron density increases the ability of electrons to screen the coulomb interaction with the _ external _ excited electron also increases , which leads to a smaller screened interaction and a reduced hot - electron decay .",
