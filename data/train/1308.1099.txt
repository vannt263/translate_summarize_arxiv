    "after dark matter , dust may be the most mysterious component of galaxies . aside from the milky way ( mw ) and a few well - studied galaxies , we know little about the types of grains , the distribution of dust with respect to stars , or the dust to gas or dust to star ratio .",
    "consequently , the dust production and destruction cycle and the role of dust within the baryon cycle of galaxies are poorly understood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we know that dust affects the energy balance in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , the cooling of gas , and hence star formation .",
    "however , dust is currently not included in theoretical galaxy evolution models , and appropriate observations needed to constrain these processes are still missing .",
    "moreover , in order to study the stellar populations of galaxies , we must have a solid understanding of the properties and spatial distribution of dust .    when deriving the properties of distant galaxies from photometric or spectroscopic observations , we commonly assume a uniform attenuation law , often implemented as a simple screen .",
    "yet we know that the dust attenuation law is not universal .",
    "for example , the mw and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) extinction curve to a lesser extent exhibit a dust absorption feature around 2175  @xcite , which is absent in 4 out of 5 sight - lines toward the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and in an empirical attenuation curve for starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "this feature has been seen in other galaxies as well , out to @xmath3 or even higher , though not as strong as for the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the slope of the attenuation curve also varies among different sight - lines and galaxies .",
    "variations in the dust attenuation curve are expected on theoretical grounds @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of the observed differences between the various laws are poorly understood .",
    "for example , we do not know what types of grains are responsible for the 2175  dust bump ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nor what physical process governs its strength .",
    "we stress that dust attenuation and extinction are distinct concepts ; attenuation includes dust geometry and radiative transfer effects , which may in part explain the observed differences .        in order to understand the role of dust and to correct the integrated light from galaxies , we need to gain a better understanding of the processes shaping the dust attenuation curve .",
    "the dust attenuation curve can be derived from the stellar light of galaxies , but it requires wide wavelength coverage and sufficient spectral resolution .",
    "both requirements are needed to break degeneracies with other modeling parameters , such as stellar age and star formation timescale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to directly detect the uv dust bump .",
    "this combination has recently become feasible with the completion of the newfirm medium - band survey ( nmbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this letter we use well - sampled composite seds constructed from the nmbs photometry @xcite , in combination with the flexible stellar population synthesis ( fsfs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) models , to constrain the dust attenuation curve in @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the nmbs is a 0.5 square degree photometric survey in the cosmos and aegis fields , unique for its 5 customly designed medium - band near - infrared filters .",
    "the data obtained using these filters are combined with optical - to - mir photometry . for this study",
    "we make use of the nmbs catalogs in the cosmos field , which include medium - band photometry at optical wavelengths as well .",
    "when no spectroscopic redshifts are available , we use photometric redshifts ( eazy ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which have an accuracy of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the high quality of the nmbs photometry has been illustrated in @xcite and @xcite .    in @xcite we divided the nmbs galaxies at @xmath0 and with a s / n@xmath5 into different spectral classes , based on their observed optical - to - irac seds .",
    "each spectral class contains 22 - 455 individual galaxies of similar spectral shape . for each class we constructed a composite sed , by de - redshifting and scaling the observed photometry .",
    "these composite seds are basically low - resolution spectra ( @xmath6 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ) , and show many spectral features among which  which is blended with [ nii ] and [ sii ] and the blended [ oiii ] and h@xmath7  lines . continuum and absorption features are also visible , among which mgii , the balmer and 4000  breaks , and the dust absorption feature at 2175 .     +",
    "we constrain the dust attenuation curve by fitting the composite seds with fsps models in their default setting .",
    "these settings include a low contribution from thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we assume a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) and an exponentially declining star forming history .",
    "our result is robust against the choice of the imf , as it primarily affects the mass - to - light ratio , and has little impact on the shape of the sed .",
    "we explore a grid of stellar ages , star formation timescales , and three different metallicities ( 0.0096 , 0.019 ( @xmath8 ) , & 0.03 ) .",
    "we use the stellar population fitting code fast @xcite , which is based on a simple @xmath9 minimization . for the photometric uncertainties we assume a flat error in @xmath10 of 3% of the average flux , in order to ensure that the full sed shape will be taken into account in the fit .",
    "if we would use the formal errors , the fit would be driven completely by the very small error bars at longer wavelengths .",
    "the region around  is masked in the fit .",
    "the confidence intervals are calibrated using monte carlo simulations .",
    "first , we explore the mw @xcite and the calzetti dust attenuation curves , and find the best - fit stellar population model when allowing all other parameters to vary .",
    "next , we parameterize the dust attenuation curve following the prescription by @xcite :    @xmath11    with @xmath12 the lorentzian - like drude profile to parameterize the uv bump , defined as : @xmath13 for the central wavelength of the dust bump @xmath14 we adopt 2175 . for @xmath15 , the full width at the half maximum of the bump",
    ", we assume a value of 350  as found by @xcite from a stack of a spectra of high - redshift galaxies and by @xcite for the mw uv bump .",
    "we explore a grid of values for  and @xmath16 , while leaving all other fitting parameters free .",
    "all attenuation curves are implemented as uniform screens .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fit ] we show the best - fit stellar population models for three composite seds , for the three different attenuation laws .",
    "this figure illustrates that for all three seds the calzetti and mw law provide poor fits at rest - frame uv wavelengths .",
    "when leaving both the slope and bump strength as free parameters , we can reproduce their full sed shapes .",
    "the best - fit values for  and @xmath16 for all composite seds with @xmath17 are shown in figure  [ fig : results]a .",
    "there is a clear correlation between both properties , described by the following linear fit : @xmath18 sed types with steeper attenuation curves have stronger uv bumps , while shallower attenuation curves go together with weaker uv bumps .",
    "in the previous section we found a large variety in dust attenuation curves among the different sed types . in order to examine whether the shape of the dust law correlates with spectral type ,",
    "we show both @xmath19 and @xmath16 as a function of the equivalent width of ( ) in figures  [ fig : results]b  and  c. similar to the specific sfr ,  is a measure of the present to past star formation in a galaxy .",
    "this measurement directly follows out of the composite seds , and thus is independent of the fsps modeling .",
    "we do note that may include some contamination by  and , and thus may be slightly overestimated .",
    "figures  [ fig : results]b  and  c show that the shape of attenuation curve correlates with spectral type .",
    "galaxies with higher values for  have shallower attenuation curves with weaker uv bumps .",
    "the only significant outlier to this trend is sed type 8 , which is best fit by a shallow dust slope ( @xmath20 ) , while having a low .",
    "the least square fits give the following relations : @xmath21 @xmath22    our findings suggest that the dust attenuation curve should not be treated as a universal function , but should be related to the spectral type . in the next section",
    "we examine the implications of our results .",
    "comparing broadband seds or spectra with stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models is a popular method to derive galaxy properties . in this procedure , the shape of the dust attenuation curve is almost always held fixed .",
    "here we examine possible biases introduced by assuming the popular calzetti dust attenuation law .",
    "figure  [ fig : implications ] shows the difference in best - fit galaxy properties for a free dust law compared to when assuming the calzetti law .",
    "this figure illustrates that a fixed dust law may introduce systematic biases .  and",
    "the specific sfr could be significantly overestimated for galaxies with high , while stellar mass may be slightly underestimated . for lower values of  we",
    "find the opposite effect .",
    "however , this trend is driven by only one sed type ( 12 ) , which was previously noticed in @xcite as being poorly fit by any sps model , and thus this trend is not significant .     using the relation by @xcite versus the strength of the dust feature for all composite seds with @xmath23 .",
    "this figure illustrates that dust corrections based on photometric measurements , may be significantly underestimated , resulting in underestimated sfrs .",
    "however , the choice of filters in this illustration may possibly represent the worst case scenario , and different filters , redshifts , or the availability of multiple filters will lead to smaller biases.[fig : beta ] , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    at high redshift dust attenuation corrections are frequently derived from the uv @xmath7 slope ( @xmath24 ) , adopting the relation of @xcite .",
    "this relation was based on a uv slope measured by masking the uv bump and other features .",
    "in contrast , the measurements at high redshift are based on a small number of broadband filters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in figure  [ fig : beta ] we use the composite seds to assess how the uv bump may influence the measurement of the uv slope , and hence the dust correction . in the top panel",
    "we show an example composite sed , the corresponding photometric measurements for two rest - frame uv filters for this sed , and the slopes based on the composite sed ( dashed line ) and photometric datapoints ( dotted lines ) . in the lower panel",
    "we show the difference in the derived attenuation correction  based on the two uv slopes  versus the strength of the dust feature , for all composite seds with @xmath25 .",
    "this figure illustrates that the presence of a dust feature may lead to underestimated dust corrections , and thus underestimated sfrs .",
    "stronger dust features clearly result in larger biases .",
    "however , the illustration in figure  [ fig : beta ] is probably a worst case scenario , where only two filters are used , and the reddest filter completely overlaps with the uv bump .",
    "several studies use three to four photometric bands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to measure the uv slope , resulting in more robust measurements .",
    "furthermore ,  increases with increasing redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus at a redshift of @xmath26 ( used in the illustration in fig .  [ fig : beta ] ) or higher the bump may be insignificant .",
    "we do note though , that the utility of the uv slope for estimating dust attenuation has been called into question before ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    ) vs. the slope ( @xmath16 ) of the best - fit attenuation curve for all composite seds with @xmath23 . instead of symbols ,",
    "we show the @xmath27-band hst images of 2 - 4 galaxies per sed type .",
    "the galaxies are chosen to be closest in redshift to @xmath28 , thus the images show the rest - frame optical morphologies .",
    "the images are color coded by  ( i.e , the specific sfr ) .",
    "this figure illustrates that galaxies with low  and/or edge - on galaxies have steeper attenuation curves with stronger uv bumps , while face - on and/or high  galaxies have shallower curves with weaker uv bumps .",
    "[ fig : im ] , scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "the primary result of this letter is that the shape of the dust attenuation curve varies with spectral type .",
    "this trend may be explained by differences in the dust - to - star geometry , which could result in age - dependent extinction and variations in the scattering and absorption of radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , a two - component dust model ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which all stars are attenuated by the diffuse ism , while younger stars experience additional attenuation due to dust in their short - lived birth clouds , naturally produces the observed trends .",
    "this model predicts variation with galaxy inclination as well , as the optical depth of the diffuse component is larger for edge - on galaxies . in figure",
    "[ fig : im ] , we show hst morphologies @xcite as function of @xmath19 and @xmath16 .",
    "this figure illustrates that face - on and/or more active galaxies on average have shallower attenuation curves with weaker uv bumps .",
    "similar trends are also seen in local galaxies @xcite . only sed type 8 , which we mentioned before , does not follow the trends",
    ".    the observed correlations between the attenuation curve and the specific sfr may also reflect variations in the grain size distribution .",
    "this could arise from a changing balance between grain formation , growth , and destruction with star formation history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "see @xcite for more discussion on the proposed explanations    our values for @xmath29 and @xmath16 are in the same range to those found by @xcite , who fit the photometry of individual galaxies in the goods - s field .",
    "they also find weaker uv bump strengths in galaxies with larger specific sfrs ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite find no correlation though between the slope and the dust bump for their sample .",
    "this may not be surprising , as for individual galaxies the photometric resolution and s / n may not be sufficient to resolve the bump and to break modeling degeneracies . as a result the scatter in the measurements will be large , and possible trends may be washed out .    while the study presented in this letter",
    "has been enabled by stacking seds of similar type , this is also a weakness , as we may be combining galaxies with different attenuation curves .",
    "furthermore , the rest - frame wavelength coverage is not the same for all redshifts , and at bluer wavelengths the seds are dominated by the higher redshift galaxies in our sample .",
    "thus , extending this study to shorter wavelengths , using galex data will give a more robust and representative measurement of the uv attenuation curve .",
    "another drawback is that we only look at the attenuated and not at the re - emitted light . in a future study",
    "we will extend the composite seds to longer wavelengths as well , so that we can simultaneously study the dust attenuation and emission as a function of spectral type .",
    "in this letter , we use composite seds , constructed from nmbs photometry , to study variations in the dust attenuation curve in @xmath0 galaxies . based on similarities between the full sed shapes , we have divided galaxies in different spectral classes and stacked the photometry .",
    "as each spectral type contains galaxies which span a range in redshift , the resulting seds are well sampled in wavelength and show various spectral features among which h@xmath2 and the 2175  dust feature .",
    "we fit all composite seds with fsps models , while exploring attenuation curves with varying slopes and uv bump strengths .",
    "the mw and calzetti law provide poor fits at uv wavelengths for nearly all sed types .",
    "we find that the strength of the uv bump and the slope of the curve are strongly correlated , with steeper slopes having stronger uv dust bumps .",
    "moreover , the shape of the dust attenuation curve correlates with the equivalent width of  ( i.e. , specific sfr ) , with higher  galaxies having shallower dust attenuation curves and weaker uv bumps .",
    "the average attenuation law has a uv bump strength of @xmath30% of the mw bump , and a slope in between the smc and the mw extinction curve .",
    "our results are consistent with a two - component dust model , in which all stars are attenuated by the diffuse ism , while young stars experience extra attenuation due to dust in their short - lived birth clouds .",
    "a qualitative analysis of the morphologies further supports this picture , as edge - on galaxies have on average steeper dust curves and stronger uv bumps .",
    "a varying grain size distribution may also contribute to the observed correlations with h@xmath2 equivalent width .",
    "a non - universal dust attenuation curve has numerous implications for galaxy evolution studies . by assuming",
    "a universal dust law , derived stellar population properties will suffer from systematic biases .",
    "for example , for the calzetti law , the dust content and specific sfr could be significantly overestimated .",
    "stellar mass measurements are more robust , and are only slightly underestimated .",
    "furthermore , the biases vary with spectral type .",
    "the presence of the dust bump also complicates dust corrections based the uv @xmath7 slope . in the worst case scenario , when",
    "the reddest filter overlaps with the bump , a@xmath31 could be underestimated by @xmath321 mag , resulting in significantly underestimated sfrs . on a positive note ,",
    "the observed variation should motivate theoretical work aimed at embedding self - consistent dust models into galaxy formation models .",
