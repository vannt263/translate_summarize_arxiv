    "the quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) @xmath2 antiferromagnet bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1is recognized as an almost ideal model material for studying exotic spin dynamics in weakly - interacting quantum spin chains.@xcite in a series of papers@xcite we have demonstrated that in this compound it is possible to observe a separation between single - particle spin wave excitations , characteristic of a classical system with long - range magnetic order , and a gapped continuum of states that is a property of the quantum 1d heisenberg model .",
    "quite recently however , another aspect of the physics of bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1  attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "it was found that in the ordered state of bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 , an application of a magnetic field along the direction of ordered moment leads to _ two _ consecutive spin re - orientation transitions.@xcite this phenomenon is in contrast with the typical behavior of a conventional antiferromagnet in a field , where only a single `` spin - flop '' transition occurs .    by far , the largest energy scale of magnetic interactions in bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1is that of antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor coupling within the spin chains , that run along the @xmath3 axis of the orthorhombic crystal structure ( space group _ pnma _ , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6.@xcite ) .",
    "the in - chain exchange constant is @xmath7  mev , as previously determined from inelastic neutron scattering experiments and bulk susceptibility measurements.@xcite exchange coupling between the chains is much weaker , with @xmath8  mev and @xmath9  mev , for nearest - neighbors along the @xmath10 and @xmath11 axes , respectively , and @xmath12  mev along the @xmath13 diagonal.@xcite the spin wave spectrum shows a small anisotropy gap of about 0.3  mev , corresponding to an easy axis along the @xmath14 crystallographic direction.@xcite long - range magnetic ordering occurs at a low nel temperature of @xmath15  k.@xcite the ordered magnetic moment is rather small , @xmath160.15  @xmath17 per cu@xmath18.@xcite in the ordered state the spins are parallel to the magnetic easy axis .",
    "nearest - neighbor spins along the @xmath11 and @xmath3 axes are aligned antiparallel relative to each other , while nearest neighbors along @xmath10 are ferromagnetically aligned.@xcite the spin structure is visualized in fig .",
    "[ struct ] .",
    "the phase transitions that are the subject of this work occur at relatively low fields @xmath19  t and @xmath20  t , applied along the easy axis , and produce characteristic jumps in the magnetization curve.@xcite to date , the spin structure in the high - field phases has not been determined . however , in ref .",
    "it was suggested that upon going through the first transition , the spins `` flop '' into the @xmath21 crystallographic plane .",
    "the second transition was then described as an unusual _ spin rotation within the plane perpendicular to the field _ , and is somewhat similar to that recently found in k@xmath0v@xmath22o@xmath23.@xcite    a schematic view of the zero - field magnetic structure of bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath2 cu@xmath18 ions form slightly zigzag antiferromagnetic chains.,width=307 ]    based on an analysis of the high - field magnetization data , it was conjectured@xcite that the unusual second spin re - orientation in bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1  is a result of competition between dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) off - diagonal exchange interaction in the spin chains and isotropic exchange coupling between the chains .",
    "in the present work we report the results of magnetic neutron diffraction studies of the various spin - flop states in bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we find the results to be _ inconsistent with the previously proposed model_. it appears that inter - chain coupling dominates over dm interactions , and that the series of spin re - orientation transitions can not result from a competition between the two effects alone .",
    "alternative mechanisms for the two - stage spin flop transition in bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1  are discussed .",
    "a @xmath24  mm@xmath25 sample was mounted in a 6  t cryomagnet on the d23 lifting counter diffractometer at institut laue langevin .",
    "the @xmath26 axis was aligned parallel to the field direction . with 8 magnetic cu@xmath18 per unit cell , in the ordered state",
    "all magnetic reflections coincide with nuclear ones . in addition , the ordered magnetic moment in bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1  is small , and detecting the magnetic contributions to bragg intensities is rather difficult .",
    "the measurements were therefore performed in differential mode . at @xmath27  t ,",
    "@xmath28  t ( below @xmath29 ) and 5  t ( above @xmath29 ) the diffractometer was consecutively positioned on each accessible bragg reflection . without moving any instrument motors ,",
    "the peak intensity was measured first at 2  k and then again at 10  k. this measurement yielded the ratio of nuclear and magnetic scattering intensities .",
    "the absolute values of nuclear intensities were separately measured at 10  k in standard rocking scans .",
    "the rocking curves also provided an estimate of the background around each bragg position .",
    "the measured integrated nuclear intensities , backgrounds , and peak intensity ratios were then used to estimate integrated magnetic intensities . in another experiment ,",
    "the peak intensities of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 reflections were monitored as a function of applied field in the range 05.5  t. peak intensities measured in this fashion were assumed to be proportional to integrated intensities , with the normalization factor determined at @xmath27 , as described above .",
    "due to the strong in - chain coupling , any canting of neighboring spins away from a perfect antiferromagnetic alignment within each chain will be small and undetectable in our measurements . in analyzing the data",
    ", we could therefore safely rely on an approximation in which within each chain all spins are collinear .",
    "inter - chain coupling is considerably weaker than the in - chain one , and is comparable in strength to the zeeman energy associated with experimental fields . for this reason the relative orientation of staggered moments in neighboring chains could not be considered fixed , as it may actually vary with field . since there are four chains within each unit cell of bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 , solving the magnetic structure at each field was reduced to determining the orientations of four spins , one from each chain , labeled as @xmath33@xmath34 in fig .",

    "the second phase transition is much more unusual , since it involves a spin rotation in the plane perpendicular to @xmath77 .",

    "is that the main components of the dzyaloshinskii vector for the nearest - neighbor bond within the chains lie in the @xmath21 plane , and alternate sign from one bond to the next . in this case ,",
    "dm interactions produce a weak - ferromagnetic canting of the spins within each chain even in zero applied field . in the presence of an external field ,",
    "additional canting is due to zeeman energy .",
    "the free energy of the system is minimized when the two canting effects are in the same direction . for this to be the case , nearest - neighbor spins along the @xmath10 axis have to be almost _ antiparallel _ to each other , since dzyaloshinskii vectors in the adjacent chains are _ antiparallel _ as well .",

    "inter - chain coupling along the @xmath10 axis . in the model proposed in ref .",
    ", the frustration is resolved in phase ii by having all spins aligned almost parallel to the dzyaloshinskii vector ( roughly along the @xmath10 axis ) , which practically eliminates the dzyaloshinskii energy altogether , and the ferromagnetic inter - chain coupling energy along the @xmath10 axis is minimized . in phase",
    "iii the model predicts that the combination of dm and zeeman energies wins over inter - chain interactions : the spins rotate to be almost parallel to the @xmath11 axis and ca nt in the direction of the applied field to minimize both energies . at the same time , nearest - neighbors along the @xmath10 axis become almost antiparallel , despite a ferromagnetic coupling in this direction .",
    "the results presented above clearly demonstrate that the actual spin arrangements in bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1  in phases ii and iii are totally different from those previously conjectured . in ref .",
    "it was emphasized that the dzyaloshinskii vectors not being strictly parallel to the @xmath10 axis , and additional inter - chain interactions along the @xmath80 and @xmath81 directions being present , the critical field and the details of the spin structures may deviate from those predicted by the simplified model .",
    "however , even in the more general case , if the @xmath29 transition in bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1  was indeed driven by a competition between dm interactions and isotropic inter - chain coupling , the energy of the latter would have to change abruptly upon going through the transition .",
    "the present data clearly show that this is _ not _ the case , since at @xmath29 the spin structure rotates as a whole , and the relative spin orientations , and with them the inter - chain exchange energies , remain practically unchanged .",
    "it appears that inter - chain coupling dominates over dm interactions in all three phases .",
    "because of the canting in phase ii , the energy of inter - chain interactions is actually better minimized in phase iii , rather than phase ii .",
    "this sequence is opposite to that emerging from the model proposed in ref .  .",
    "we believe that at the present stage it is unwise to attempt a quantitative explanation of the phase transitions in bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1  based on some specific spin hamiltonian .",
    "too many parameters are involved to make such an analysis unambiguous .",
    "the energy scale of inter - chain interactions and @xmath3-axis anisotropy are indeed similar to that defined by transition fields .",
    "however , the hamiltonian is expected to have other terms on the same energy scale , and these _ can not be dismissed_. in particular , measurements of the spin wave spectrum contain evidence of an in - plane anisotropy of the magnitude @xmath82  mev .",
    "this anisotropy is most likely due to the so - called kaplan schekhtman entin - wohlman aharony ( ksea ) interactions.@xcite the ksea term is a companion to dm interactions , and is an easy axis parallel to the dzyaloshinskii vector .",
    "ksea interactions are believed to be the driving force in the spin reorientation transition in k@xmath0v@xmath22o@xmath23.@xcite the similarity of the behavior of the latter compound with that found in bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1  may indicate that anisotropy effects , and ksea interactions in particular , could be responsible for the @xmath29 transition in the silicate as well .",
    "in summary , the actual mechanism of the exotic two - stage spin flop transition in bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1  remains a mystery .",
    "what is clear though , is that dm interactions and inter - chain exchange coupling alone can not sufficient to explain phenomenon .",
    "it appears more likely that both transitions in bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1  are caused by a competition between dm interactions and diagonal magnetic anisotropy effects , of which more needs to be learned .",
