    "there is a a plenitude of logical approaches to the modelling of defeasible reasoning known as nonmonotonic logics ( in short , nmls ) .",
    "these approaches often use different methods , representational formats or key ideas , making it sometimes difficult to compare them , e.g.  with respect to the consequence relations they give rise to . such comparisons are important to systematise the field of nmls and to gain insights into which forms of defeasible reasoning are expressible in which formal frameworks . an important tool for such comparisons are translations between systems of nml . if one system ( or a fragment thereof ) is translatable into another system we immediately know that the latter system is at least as expressive as the former .",
    "moreover , this may lead to forms of cross - fertilisation , since meta - theoretic properties become transferable between the translated systems .    in this contribution we will investigate several such translations .",
    "given the richness of the domain of nmls , we approach the topic from a specific angle",
    ". our focus will be on structured argumentation , on the one hand , and nmls that model defeasible inferences in terms of strict inference rules and defeasible assumptions , on the other hand .",
    "as a side product , the translation will also cover a significant subclass of nmls in the klm paradigm based on preferential semantics @xcite .",
    "at least since dung introduced abstract argumentation @xcite , formal argumentation has been an important sub - domain of nml .",
    "while in abstract argumentation arguments are not phrased in a formal language and the underlying inferences are not explicated , several systems of structured or instantiated formal argumentation have been developed which overcome this limitation ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a partial overview ) . in this paper",
    "we will focus on two of the most prominent accounts : assumption - based argumentation ( in short , aba ) @xcite and aspic@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "one of the key differences between several formal approaches to defeasible reasoning concerns the question of how to model defeasible inferences .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the defeasible inference from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "the question is whether such an inference should be phrased in terms of a strict inference rule or a defeasible one .",
    "a strict inference rule allows for no exceptions : if its premises @xmath2 are true , the consequent @xmath3 is true as well .",
    "in contrast , defeasible rules allow for exceptions , that is , under specific circumstances it may hold that all premises @xmath2 of the rule hold while the consequent @xmath3 does nt . clearly , in the approach with strict rules defeasibility has to enter in a different way .",
    "one way is by means of explicitly stated defeasible assumptions @xmath4 , i.e. , specific premises which are assumed to hold by default and which can serve as antecedents of strict rules .",
    "an inference is retracted in case there is a demonstration that one of the defeasible assumptions @xmath4 does nt hold .",
    "aba follows the approach based on strict rules and defeasible assumptions . in aspic@xmath0",
    "both approaches can be represented .",
    "not surprisingly , aba has been shown to be translatable to aspic@xmath0 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will show the other ( perhaps more surprising ) direction , namely that aspic@xmath0 ( without priorities ) can be translated into aba and thus that both frameworks are equi - expressive .",
    "there are several nonmonotonic systems that model defeasible inference by means of strict rules . among them",
    "are adaptive logics ( in short , als ) @xcite , makinsons default assumptions and forms of circumscription .",
    "makinson s default assumptions and in view of the translation in @xcite also als are a generalisations of approaches based on maximal consistent subsets @xcite . in view of",
    "we know that there are close connections between approaches based on maximal consistent subsets and structured argumentation . in this paper the ties will be strengthened .",
    "we show that als can be translated into aba and aspic@xmath0 and present a translation in the opposite direction for a subclass of aba and aspic@xmath0",
    ". we will proceed as follows : in sections [ sec : adaptive - logics][sec : aspic+ ] we introduce the basic systems ( als , preferential semantics , default assumptions , aba , and aspic@xmath0 ) . in sections",

    "als are a general framework for the formal explication of defeasible reasoning .",
    "it has been applied to a multitude of defeasible reasoning forms ( mainly related to questions from philosophical logic ) , such as nonmonotonic forms of reasoning with inconsistent information , causal discovery , inductive generalisations , abductive hypothesis generation , normative reasoning , etc .",
    "( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "the driving idea behind als is to apply defeasible inference rules under explicit normality assumptions .",
    "more specifically , given a compact tarksi logic @xmath5 ( the _ core _ or _",
    "lower limit logic _ ) in a formal language @xmath6 and with the derivability relation @xmath7 , a set of _ abnormalities _ @xmath8 is fixed .",
    "now , whenever the core logic gives rise to @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 can be derived in the adaptive logic ( based on @xmath5 and @xmath12 ) on the ( defeasible ) assumption that @xmath13 is false .",
    "is supposed to be classical .",
    "in fact , in the standard format of als which we consider here , the core logic is supposed to be supraclassical . whenever non - classical logics are used as core logics , classical negation @xmath14 and classical disjunction @xmath15 are superimposed . ]    in als this basic idea of modeling defeasible inferences is implemented in hilbert - style proofs .",
    "we will first explain the proof theory of als .",
    "then we give alternative characterizations of the adaptive consequence relations that are central to prove the adequacy of our translations in subsequent sections .    in als ,",
    "usual hilbert - style proofs are adjusted in two major ways .",
    "first , to keep track of normality assumptions , proof lines in adaptive proofs are equipped with an additional column in which the abnormalities are listed that are assumed to be false .",
    "second , different _ retraction mechanisms _ for lines with abnormality assumptions that turn out mistaken are implemented in terms of so - called _ adaptive strategies_. we will give some examples below .    to further explain how adaptive proofs work , it is useful to turn to a concrete example . as an illustration ,",
    "we take a look at inconsistency - als .",
    "these are based on paraconsistent core logics such as * lp * or * * clun(s)**. these core logics typically do not validate disjunctive syllogism @xmath16 since in case @xmath11 is involved in a contradiction , @xmath3 would not follow ( then @xmath17 would suffice for the disjunction @xmath18 to be true ) .",
    "nevertheless , inconsistency - als allow for the defeasible application of disjunctive syllogism under the _ normality assumption _ that there is no contradiction in @xmath11 .",
    "hence , in inconsistency als the abnormalities in @xmath12 typically have the form of a contradiction @xmath19 .",
    "e.g. , in paraconsistent core logics it usually holds that @xmath20 and thus one can defeasibly derive @xmath3 under the assumption that there is no contradiction in @xmath11 . clearly , sometimes such assumptions turn out to be mistaken in view of the given premises . obviously , this is the case if @xmath19 is derivable from the given premises .",
    "a more interesting case is given , if @xmath19 is not directly derivable but it is derivable as a member of a minimal disjunction of abnormalities .",
    "we illustrate this in the following example .",

    "the distinction between strict and defeasible rule - arguments allows us to define a variety of attack forms :    [ def : aspic : att ] where @xmath32 , @xmath24 attacks @xmath33 ( in signs , @xmath34 ) iff    * @xmath35 for some @xmath36 ( _ undermining _ ) .",

    "have been explicated within the als family ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : adaptive - logics ] ) , all these reasoning forms are now available in the domain of formal argumentation .",

    "for instance , once embedded in aspic@xmath0 we gain rich resources to express preferences and priorities .    in view of the other direction , from a subclass of aba to als , we know that this class can be understood in terms of the model - theoretic tools provided by klm - style preferential semantics or , alternatively , as consistency management in terms of maximal consistent subsets as provided by default assumptions .",

    "moreover , properties of the al consequence relations apply to this class of aba .",

    "finally , besides the available dialogue - based methods to model argumentative reasoning processes ( e.g.  @xcite ) , now the dynamic proof theory of adaptive logics can also be used for this purpose .",
    "finally , we complete the circle between aba and aspic@xmath401 ( without priorities / preferences ) by providing a translation from the latter to the former , whereas the other direction has been presented in @xcite . as a side - product",
    "this provides a way to phrase the defeasible rules of aspic@xmath401 as strict rules .",
    "this shows that the strict fragment of aspic@xmath401 ( without strict rules and thus without rebuttals and undercuts ) is equi - expressive with full aspic@xmath401 .",
    "such insights are conceptually interesting and may simplify future meta - theoretic investigations into aspic@xmath401 .    in future work",
    "we intend to generalise our investigations to approaches with priorities and preferences as provided in aspic@xmath401 and some generalisations of als .",
    "an interesting question will be , for instance , whether full aspic@xmath401 is translatable into lexicographic als ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.5 ) or whether the latter can be translated to aba or aspic@xmath401 ."
