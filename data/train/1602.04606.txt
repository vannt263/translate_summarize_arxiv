    "given the highly successful use of trapped ions and ultracold atoms in studying quantum physics , it is of considerable interest to couple these two systems on the quantum level  @xcite .",
    "the main features of each may thus be combined to break new ground in studying quantum many - body physics  @xcite .",
    "proposals aimed at quantum information processing  @xcite and the generation of entangled atom - ion systems have been put forward recently  @xcite , which point the way towards such hybrid atom - ion quantum systems . however",
    ", the time - dependent trapping field of the ions in a paul trap poses a significant obstacle for these ideas as it limits attainable temperatures in interacting atom - ion systems  @xcite .",
    "this effect stems from the fast micromotion of ions trapped in radio frequency traps which may cause coupling to high energy states when collisions with atoms occur .",
    "additional optical potentials for the atoms that prevent the atoms from colliding with the ions , while still allowing significant interactions , are quite challenging to implement .",
    "this is because the atom - ion interaction typically takes place on the 100  nm scale and has a steep @xmath0 character , with @xmath1 the distance between the atom and ion , making it very hard to optically resolve .",
    "these issues put severe restraints on proposed schemes for generating entanglement between atoms and ions  @xcite , such as employing controlled collisions with state - dependent scattering length  @xcite and coupling single ions to atomic josephson junctions  @xcite , where the atoms have to be brought very close to the ion . other experimental approaches such as octupole traps with nearly field - free regions  @xcite and optical trapping of the ions  @xcite , seriously reduce the merits of the trapped ion platform such as long lifetimes and localisation of individual ions .    here , we propose another route towards interacting atom - ion quantum systems and provide a solution to the micromotion - induced limitations when coupling these systems .",
    "in particular , we propose to couple atoms to low - lying rydberg states  @xcite such that their polarizability is significantly increased .",
    "this in turn increases the range over which the atom - ion interaction is effective to the micrometer range .",
    "optical or magnetic potentials that bring the atoms within this distance of the ion , but still prevent the atoms from sampling the micromotion , can be straight - forwardly generated . furthermore , the interaction can be made state - dependent by tuning laser parameters and allows for dynamical control as well .",
    "this last point is of importance to bridge the energy differences between trapped atomic and ionic systems commonly encountered in laboratory settings , by modulating the interaction close to the ionic motional resonance as we describe below .",
    "the interactions between the rydberg - coupled atom and the ion can be used to entangle these particles or to mediate spin - spin interactions between atoms in close analogy to much employed quantum gates in trapped ions .",
    "the setup we have in mind is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_coordinates ] : a single ion ( red  left ) is trapped at the potential minimum of a paul trap undergoing a harmonic oscillator motion with trap frequency @xmath2 . in its close vicinity",
    "an atom ( blue  right ) is optically trapped , experiencing both , the potential due to the paul trap and the optical light field . a laser weakly couples one of the hyperfine ground states of the atom @xmath3 to a rydberg level , but not the second one @xmath4 .",
    "this can be done by , e.g. , laser polarization or a large frequency difference between the states . by modulating the intensity of the rydberg laser  and thereby the atom - ion coupling  at a frequency @xmath5 the ionic motion",
    "gets excited when the atom is in the state @xmath3 , but not when it is in the state @xmath4 .",
    "we will show that the effective interaction ( to lowest order in the atom - ion separation and within the rotating wave approximation ) can be described by : h_i(a^e^it+a e^-it ) _ a , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 the creation and annihilation operators of the ionic motion .",
    "this effective hamiltonian entangles the motional state of the ion with the internal state of the atom .",
    "an additional laser field that generates a spin - motion interaction of the form h_s - m(a^e^it+a e^-it ) _ i , can be used to map the ion motion onto internal states of the ion , generating effective ( pseudo ) spin - spin interactions between atoms and ions  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the ion motion may serve as a bus to generate spin - spin interactions between atoms .",
    "the scheme closely resembles state - of - the - art trapped ion based quantum gates and retains some of the main benefits associated with them  @xcite . in particular",
    ", no ground state cooling of the atom or ion is required  @xcite and the gate and spin - spin interactions are to a large degree immune to micromotion  @xcite . in analogy to the trapped ion case , these benefits are a direct consequence of the ( near ) linearity of the atom - ion interactions at large distances and break down for small atom - ion distances .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sec .",

    "[ sec : outlook ] we draw conclusions and discuss the prospects for scaling up .",
    "in the following section we derive an effective potential for the interaction of an alkali rydberg - atom with a singly charged ion for large atom - ion distances . our strategy to solve the problem will be the following : we start with a three - body model system comprised of two singly charged spin - less particles  the ion and the core of the atom  and an electron .",
    "then , we will use the born - oppenheimer approximation and expand the ion - electron and ion - core interaction to second order in the relative core - electron coordinate to obtain the dominant charge - dipole and charge - quadrupole interaction terms . with such approximated interactions between the three particles , we diagonalise the resulting hamiltonian in a truncated basis of rydberg wavefunctions obtained by means of the numerov method .",
    "we show that for the atom - ion separations and parameters considered in this work , second order perturbation theory suffices and we discuss the effects of the trapping fields .",
