    "several papers have been recently devoted to the study of multiple - species interacting bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "the first experiments involving the interaction between multiple condensates have been performed at jila , with two condensates in the hyperfine levels @xmath0 and @xmath1 of @xmath2rb confined in a ioffe - type trap @xcite .",
    "other experiments have been performed with the states @xmath3 and @xmath1 in a top trap , in a situation of nearly complete spatial overlap of the two condensates .",
    "in fact they have almost the same magnetic moment and therefore experience two ( slightly displaced ) trapping potentials with the same frequencies @xcite .",
    "the resulting dynamics reveals a complex structure and it is characterized by a strong damping of the relative motion of the two condensates @xcite .",
    "these results have been analyzed in @xcite , by identifying two dynamical regimes : ( i ) a periodic motion with a slow frequency ( with respect to the trap frequency ) , for small displacement between the traps ; ( ii ) a strong non - linear mixing which leads to a damping of the relative motion , for larger displacements ( but still smaller than the size of the initial condensate ) . by comparing the numerical solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation with the jila experiment @xcite , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite find a fair agreement , although small oscillations remain undamped for longer times compared to the experimental observation @xcite .",
    "a mixture of @xmath4rb condensates in different @xmath5 states in a top trap has been experimentally investigated also by another group @xcite , but no effects of the mutual interaction have been observed .",
    "recently we have reported some experiments performed at lens with two interacting condensates @xcite , which reveal several new features with respect to those analyzed in refs .",
    "in fact , we have considered a sudden transfer of atoms between the states @xmath6 and @xmath3 of @xmath2rb , having different magnetic moments .",
    "the @xmath3 , which is created with the same density distribution and at the same position of the @xmath6 condensate , feels a magnetic potential whose minimum is displaced along the vertical @xmath7 axis by a distance much larger that the initial size of the condensate .",
    "therefore , its dynamics is characterized by large center - of - mass oscillations .",
    "the two condensates periodically collide and these collisions have significant observable effects . among them : i ) the shape oscillations of @xmath6 condensate , triggered by the sudden transfer to the @xmath3 state , are significantly enhanced ; ii ) the center - of - mass oscillation frequency of the @xmath3 condensate is shifted upwards .    by means of preliminary numerical simulations",
    ", we have already shown that the basic features of these experimental observations can be explained within the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) theory @xcite . in this paper",
    "we better analyse the theoretical scheme and describe in more detail the numerical procedures and the approximations made .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : theor ] , we introduce the two coupled gp equations for the dynamics of the condensates and discuss the approximations used to solve them . in section [ sec : cm ] we show the results for the center - of - mass motion , stressing the effect of mutual interactions in the oscillation frequency . in section [ sec : aspect ] we discuss the collective modes of each condensate and the time evolution of the aspect ratios . in section [ sec : expansion ] we simulate the expansion of the two condensates after switching - off the trapping potential . in this way , we can compare our theoretical results with the experimental data @xcite for the center - of - mass motion and the aspect ratios .",
    "at very low temperatures , when there is no thermal cloud , the evolution of the two interacting bose - einstein condensates can be described by two coupled gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations ( @xmath8 ) : @xmath9 \\psi_i \\ ; .",

    "thus , the trapping potential @xmath15 are different and can be written as @xmath16\\\\ v_2(x , y , z ) & = & { m\\over2}\\omega_{\\perp2}^2 \\left[x^2 + y^2   + \\lambda^2 z^2\\right ] \\ ; . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from now on we use the same parameters as in the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite , that is : scattering lengths @xmath17 and @xmath18 , trapping frequencies @xmath19 hz , @xmath20 hz , and displacement @xmath21 m .",
    "the two condensates have the same asymmetry parameter @xmath22 . for the total number of atoms we use @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "in order to numerically solve the gp equations ( [ eq : gp0 ] ) one should map the two order parameters @xmath25 on a fully three - dimensional grid of points .",
    "this should be large enough to describe the oscillations of each condensate in the trap ( center - of - mass motion plus internal excitations ) as well as their expansion when the trap is switched off .",
    "this approach is computationally heavy .",
    "we prefer , at this stage , to solve the gp equations ( [ eq : gp0 ] ) within different approximate schemes , depending on the type of process we want to describe .",
    "we distinguish the following three cases .",
    "case a : dynamics of a condensate in the trap ignoring its interaction with the other . in this case",
    ", the center - of - mass ( cm ) motion is trivial : the cm of the condensate @xmath13 remains at rest , while the one of @xmath12 oscillates freely around @xmath26 at the frequency @xmath27 .",
    "the internal motion of each condensate originates from the fact that its starting configuration , after transferring atoms from @xmath13 to @xmath12 , is not the ground state configuration .",
    "in particular , the state @xmath13 feels the same trap but has less atoms : its starting shape is wider than the equilibrium one",
    ". its internal motion can be predicted by exactly solving the corresponding gp equation , without coupling with @xmath12 , i.e. , with @xmath28 . in this case , the equation has axial symmetry and we can use the numerical code developed by two of us in ref.@xcite .",
    "case b : effects of the mutual interaction in the radial motion . in order to point out the basic effects of the interaction occurring between the two condensates when they collide",
    ", one can decouple the slow axial motion from the gp equation . in this way",
    ", the simulation is reduced to a two - dimensional problem in the @xmath29-plane , which is easier to perform .",
    "we solve the coupled gp equations by using the split - step fourier method @xcite , with a fast fourier transform algorithm @xcite , by using cylindrical coordinates and dimensionless variables , as explained in the appendix .",
    "we will justify the decoupling of the axial motion later , when discussing the low energy collective modes of these condensate .",
    "case c : dynamics of the free expansion . in the experiments , the cm positions and the aspect ratios of the condensates",
    "are measured after few milliseconds of expansion , with the trap switched off .",
    "we simulate the expansion , starting from the configuration obtained in case a or b at a given time .",
    "the cm of the two condensates simply undergo a free fall under gravity .",
    "the shape of each condensate changes during the expansion .",
    "we simulate the expansion of the condensate @xmath13 by using a scaling law valid in the thomas - fermi ( large @xmath30 ) limit @xcite . we instead ignore the mutual interaction of the condensates in this process ; even if they overlap after some time ( see section [ sec : expansion ] ) , their density is much lower than the initial one , due to the fast radial expansion , and hence the mean - field interaction is also much weaker .",
    "we start from an initial configuration corresponding to the lowest stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp0 ] ) , with @xmath30 atoms in the @xmath13 condensate .",
    "this can be obtained by iterating in imaginary time , starting from a trial wave function , as done in @xcite .",
    "then , at an arbitrary time @xmath31 , one builds two condensates @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with the same density profile of the starting one , but with different number of atoms , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "if they do not interact ( @xmath28 ) , the cm of condensate @xmath13 remains at rest , while the one of the condensate @xmath12 starts oscillating around its equilibrium position @xmath34 with frequency @xmath27 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm - trapped]a .    in order to include the effects of the mutual interaction ,",
    "we make a two - dimensional simulation as explained in case b of the previous section , by ignoring the axial motion and solving the two coupled gp equations in the @xmath29-plane .",
    "thus , the initial condensate is an infinite cylinder along @xmath35 while the normalization of the two - dimensional order parameter in the @xmath29-plane is chosen in such a way to preserve the profile in the radial direction , when passing from @xmath36 to @xmath37 dimensions , as explained in the appendix .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm - trapped]b .",
    "one sees that now both condensates move . the motion of the condensate @xmath13 originates from the mutual repulsion with the condensate @xmath12 , which acts both at the beginning , when @xmath12 is formed and starts moving away from @xmath13 , and when they periodically collide .",
    "the motion of @xmath12 is still dominated by large oscillations around @xmath38 , but their frequency @xmath39 turns out to be larger than the non - interacting frequency @xmath27 by about @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , the oscillations appear to be damped .",
    "we notice that , though the minimum separation between the two center - of - mass positions slowly grows in time , it remains always smaller than the sum of the two condensate radii , at least in time interval here considered , thus ensuring that the two condensates indeed collide .",
    "the shift in frequency of the cm oscillations is one of the clear signatures of the the mutual interaction .",
    "it originates from the fact that the condensate @xmath12 moves in an effective trap which is anharmonic .",
    "in fact , the presence of the condensate @xmath13 at one side of the harmonic potential in which @xmath12 moves , provide an extra repulsion with a consequent up - shift of frequency . this shift",
    "only occurs if the two condensates overlap periodically . since it comes from the cross mean - field term in the gp equation , it depends significantly on @xmath33 .    indeed , as a first approach we can consider the 1d problem of one single classical particle moving in the effective potential @xmath41 given by the harmonic oscillator plus the repulsion of the @xmath13 atoms : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , while @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the radius and the central density of the @xmath13 condensate in the thomas - fermi ( large @xmath30 ) limit , respectively @xcite . to obtain the oscillation period ,",

    "[ fig : classic ] we see that the frequency shift predicted by eq .",
    "( [ e : classict ] ) is nicely close to the gp results .",
    "one can better visualize the effects of the interactions in the collisions by plotting the various energy terms contributing to the total energy of the system , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] .",
    "we checked that the total energy is accurately conserved during the simulation .",
    "the energies of each condensate ( kinetic , mean - field , trapping ) vary with time in a characteristic way : they change only when the condensates collide .",
    "this happens about every @xmath51  ms . during the short collision time ,",
    "when they partially overlap , the mutual interaction energy , i.e. , the term containing the scattering length @xmath52 , is significantly non - zero . in the upper part of the same figure we redraw the cm position of the condensate @xmath13 , with a vertical scale larger than in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm - trapped ] . on notices that the slope of these oscillations changes whenever the two condensates collide , the precise change ( sign and amplitude ) depending on the phase of the oscillation when each collision occurs .",
    "the behavior of the energy _ vs. _ time is strictly related to the damping of the cm oscillations of condensate @xmath12 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm - trapped]b .",
    "first , we remind that in the gp theory the damping is not due to dissipative processes , since the total energy is conserved .",
    "what happens , instead , is that the kinetic energy initially associated with the cm motion is eventually shared among many degrees of freedom .",
    "this redistribution of energy is caused by the periodic collisions .",
    "one of these degrees of freedom is the cm motion of the condensate @xmath13 .",
    "but the internal excited states of each condensate are also expected to play an important role , as discussed in the next section .",
    "let us consider the internal motion of the condensate @xmath13 .",
    "just after the transfer of @xmath32 atoms into @xmath12 , its density distribution has the same profile as the ground state of @xmath30 atoms , but with @xmath53% of atoms missing .",
    "thus , it starts oscillating around the new equilibrium configuration , the confining potential being unchanged .",
    "this situation is very similar to that studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where similar oscillations were produced by a sudden change of scattering length .",
    "if one ignores the interaction with the condensate @xmath12 , the motion of the condensate @xmath13 can be predicted by solving the gp equation ( [ eq : gp0 ] ) with @xmath54 and @xmath28 .",
    "this corresponds to case a in section [ sec : theor ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : aspect - nonint ] , we show the resulting aspect ratio , @xmath55^{1/2}$ ] ( solid line ) .",
    "the curve is clearly a superpositions of two , fast and slow , modes .    to understand which excited states partecipate in the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : aspect - nonint ] , we notices that , since the new equilibrium state is not far from the starting configuration , the amplitude of the induced oscillations is relatively small . therefore , only the lowest energy modes are excited and , among them , the ones with no angular momentum . for an elliptic trap , where only the @xmath35-component of the angular momentum is conserved",
    ", two @xmath56 states are expected to be excited .",
    "the one with lowest frequency corresponds to in - phase oscillations of the width along @xmath57 and @xmath7 and out - of - phase along @xmath35 .",
    "the one with highest frequency is an in - phase compressional mode along all directions ( breathing mode ) . in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) , large @xmath30 , regime and in the linear limit ( small amplitude )",
    ", their frequency is @xcite @xmath58 with @xmath59 when the condensate is also strongly elongated ( @xmath60 ) the two frequencies become @xmath61 in this limit the two frequencies are quite different , and the axial and radial collective excitations are almost decoupled .",
    "the radial width is characterized by small oscillations of frequency @xmath62 superimposed to a wider oscillation of frequency @xmath63 , and vice - versa for the axial width @xcite . using the parameters for the condensate @xmath13 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : omega - mp])-([eq : qmp ] ) , one finds values which differ less than @xmath64 from their asymptotic @xmath65 values in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda-0 ] ) .",
    "the tf approximation corresponds to neglecting the laplacian of the density ( i.e. , the quantum pressure ) in the gp equation . in this case",
    ", the density profile of the condensate in each direction is an inverted parabola which vanishes at the classical turning point . in the radial and axial directions , these points , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ,",
    "are given by the condition @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the chemical potential fixed by the normalization of the order parameter to @xmath33 .",
    "a nice feature of the tf regime is that both the free expansion and the lowest collective modes exhibit an exact scaling behavior : the parabolic shape is preserved and the widths @xmath66 and @xmath67 scale as @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the gp equation for the condensate @xmath13 then transforms into two coupled equations for the scaling parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 : @xmath74 the numerical solution of these differential equations is straitghforward .",
    "the result for the evolution of the aspect ratio of condensate @xmath13 , @xmath75 , is shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : aspect - nonint ] and compared with the one obtained with the exact solution of the gp equation ( solid line ) for the same condensate , @xmath76^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the shape of the two curves is very similar as a consequence of the fact that the parameter @xmath77 , with @xmath78^{1/2}$ ] , is indeed much greater than @xmath79 , as required to ensure the validity of the tf approximation .",
    "they differ only for a small vertical shift due to the different definitions of the aspect ratio ; this shift would vanish only in the @xmath80 limit @xcite .",
    "the aspect ratio in fig .  [ fig : aspect - nonint ] ignores the mutual interaction between the two condensates in the periodic collisions .",
    "since this interaction breaks the axial symmetry in the motion of @xmath13 , one should solve the coupled gp equation in full tree - dimensions .",
    "here we proceed differently .",
    "we observe that the axial motion is much slower than both the time interval between two collisions and the duration of a single collision .",
    "we thus assume that the axial motion does not respond significantly to the mutual interaction in the time scale here considered .",
    "vice - versa , the collision are expected to significantly affect the radial motion .",
    "we treat the radial motion by solving numerically the gp equation in the @xmath29-plane , including the mutual interaction ( case b of section [ sec : theor ] ) . in this case",
    ", the collisions with the @xmath12 condensate make the radial motion of @xmath13 rather complex . assuming the axial width to be the same as without collisions , and using the radial width obtained by the 2d integration of the coupled gp equations",
    ", one can calculate the new aspect ratio .",
    "this is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : aspect - int ] .",
    "one notices that , similarly to what we have found for the center - of - mass motion in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm - trapped]b , the shape of the oscillation change at each collision , every @xmath51  ms .",
    "the evolution of the aspect ratio has a complex structure and it is not a simple superposition of the two oscillations @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the non - interacting case .",
    "the overall amplitude is enhanced .",
    "this reflects the fact that the energy of the cm oscillation of @xmath12 is transferred , not only to the cm motion of @xmath13 , but also to the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "this again , may explain part of the damping of the cm oscillations of @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm - trapped]b .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : aspect - int ] , one sees also that the interaction between the two condensates produces an initial delay for the onset of collective exitations , compared to the non - interacting case .",
    "this originates from the fact that the two condensates are initially created with the same density profile , and the scattering lenghts @xmath81 and @xmath52 have the same value .",
    "therefore the @xmath13 condensate `` realizes '' to be out - of - equilibrium only when the other condensate has moved away , i.e. after a time of the order of @xmath82 ms .",
    "the same effect can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] for the center - of - mass motion .",
    "in the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite the center - of - mass motion and the aspect ratios are measured after releasing the trap and letting the condensate expand under the effect of gravity only .    in order to compare our theoretical predictions with the experimental data we have to include the effects of the expansion .",
    "for the center - of - mass motion this is trivial .",
    "one has only to take care of the fact that the switch - off of the trapping potential is not istantaneous and can produce a magnetic gradient which affects the initial velocity of the two condensates .",
    "the two velocities have been measured experimentally , giving @xmath83cm / s and @xmath84cm / s . due to this difference ,",
    "the two condensates fall at different speed and they eventually overlap for some time during the expansion . as already said in section [ sec : theor ] ( case c ) , we ignore the mutual mean - field interaction during this process .",
    "if the overlap does not occur too early , the condensates have enough time to expand fast in the radial direction , the one of the stronger initial confinement , and their density drops quickly , so that the cross mean - field energy becomes negligible .",
    "our results for the cm position of the two condensates are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm ] . in the upper part ( a ) , we compare theory and experiment in a simple case , in which all the atoms are initially transferred into the condensate @xmath12 , which then oscillates alone in its new trap .",
    "the oscillation is undamped and its frequency is simply the trapping frequency @xmath85 hz .",
    "this picture , in which the mean - field interactions does not enter at all , has been used to fix the small delay caused by the non istantaneous switch - off of the trapping potential .",
    "this has been done by introducing the delay as a fitting parameter in the theoretical curve .",
    "its value is @xmath86  ms .    in the lower part of figs .",
    "[ fig : cm ] , we compare theory and experiment for the case of the two colliding condensates .",
    "the cm dynamics of the two condensates in the trap has been discussed in section [ sec : cm ] .",
    "starting from each point in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm - trapped]b , we have then added the effect of the fall in the gravity field . at the time of the observation ( after @xmath87 ms ) ,",
    "the condensate @xmath12 is almost always above the condensate @xmath13 , which means that they crossed during the expansion .",
    "there is an overall qualitative agreement between theory and experiments .",
    "the cm of the condensate @xmath13 moves , due to the interaction with the other condensate .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation is in agreement with theory , even though more precise measurements are needed to make the comparison more quantitative .",
    "the cm of the condensate @xmath12 exhibits a damped oscillation .",
    "its frequency is up - shifted compared to the case with no collisions ( upper part of the same figure ) .",
    "the measured frequency in the case of colliding condensates is @xmath88  hz , with a shift about @xmath89% , which is close to the theoretical shift , @xmath90% .",
    "furthermore , the oscillations appear now damped with an exponential decay time of about @xmath91  ms .",
    "our theoretical prediction for this decay time is about @xmath92  ms . as already said in the previous sections , the predicted damping originates from inelastic processes in which the energy of the cm motion is transferred to other degrees of freedom .",
    "the fact that our theory underestimate the decay time is reasonable if one consider that the theoretical curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm ] only includes the radial degrees of freedom ( we solve the coupled gp equations in the @xmath29-plane ) .",
    "the remaining contribution to the damping can naturally arise from the excitations of axial modes , which are ignored in the present analysis , namely , the possible distortions of the shape of the two condensates along @xmath35 , during each collision . a source of damping can also be the occurrence of elastic scattering processes between atoms of the two overlapping condensates , as the one discussed in @xcite .",
    "these processes are not included in the gp mean - field theory .",
    "in order to compare theory and experiments for the measured aspect ratio , one has to include the effect of the mean - field interaction in the expansion . for the condensate @xmath13 one can safely use the tf approximation . in practice",
    ", one has to solve the coupled equations ( [ eq : ddotb ] ) for the scaling parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 , after dropping the term linear in @xmath95 , which represents the trapping potential .",
    "the initial conditions for @xmath96 and @xmath97 are fixed by the configurations of the condensate @xmath13 in the trap at a given time @xmath98 , as calculated in section [ sec : aspect ] ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : aspect - int ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : aspect2 ] we plot our results , as a function of @xmath98 , compared with the experimental data .",
    "the oscillations are rather complex , as a result of the periodic collisions between the condensate .",
    "the average amplitude is in agreement with the observed data .",
    "the slow axial modulation is visible and the faster radial motion has sudden changes of amplitude .",
    "considering that in this comparison there are no fitting parameters , and the theory contains some important approximations , the overall agreement is good , and provides a further evidence of the mutual interaction between the two colliding condensates .    finally , let us comment on the aspect ratio of the condensate @xmath12 .",
    "this quantity is expected to follow an even more complex evolution , due to the fact that the initial configuration is very far from equilibrium : the trap frequencies are changed by a @xmath14 factor , the condensate is initially displaced from the minimum of its trap and has a shape originally build for @xmath30 atoms instead of @xmath32 . in the tf limit these reduction of the trapping frequencies and of the number of atoms would be equivalent to an  effective \" sudden change of the trapping frequencies , of about @xmath99% , if @xmath30 were kept fixed .",
    "therefore , due to the non - linearity of the gp equation , the resulting evolution might be chaotic , as predicted in ref .",
    "even though the tf approximation is rather poor for this condensate , which has about @xmath100 atoms , we solved the tf equations for the evolution of @xmath75 finding rather irregular oscillations between the extreme values @xmath101 .",
    "the comparison with experimental data is thus difficult , even because aspect ratios greater than about @xmath102 are not easy to be measured with the finite resolution of the imaging devices of ref .",
    "@xcite . in view of the characterization of the nonlinear ( possibly chaotic ) dynamics of these condensates",
    ", we think that a deeper quantitative analysis of this problem is worth doing in the next future by solving the gp equation in full 3d .",

    "<S> then the two condensates begin to perform collective oscillations , undergoing a complex evolution , characterized by collisions between the two condensates . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effects of their mutual interaction on the center - of - mass oscillations and on the time evolution of the aspect ratios . </S>",
