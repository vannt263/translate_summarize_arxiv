    "we recently discovered a 16  hr x - ray periodicity in the seyfert galaxy iras  18325 - 5926 using data from asca ( iwasawa et al 1998 ) . nearly 9 cycles of the oscillation",
    "were observed , with a total amplitude of about 15 per cent .",
    "the active nucleus has similar properties to that of seyfert 1 galaxies , except that the power - law continuum is slightly steeper than most ( photon index @xmath0 ) and there is moderate absorption by a column density of @xmath1 .",
    "there is also a broad iron line in the x - ray spectrum ( iwasawa et al 1996 ) which indicates the presence of an accretion disk in the x - ray emission region , viewed at moderate inclination ( 4050 deg ) .",
    "the periodicity is plausible for keplerian motion at 1020 gravitational radii around a black hole of mass @xmath2 .",
    "it also scales well with quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) seen from some galactic black hole candidates ( bhc ; belloni et al 1997 ) .",
    "the cause of the oscillation in iras  18325 - 5926 , or indeed in any bhc , is unknown .    in order to determine whether the variation is exactly periodic or a qpo , we observed iras  18325 - 5926 with the rossi x - ray timing explorer in 1997 december 2527 and 1998 february 2123 .",
    "we report here the light curves and power spectra of those observations , which also show oscillations , but of different periods .",
    "we conclude that the agn has a clear qpo signal and note that our results are consistent with the exciting possibility that 2 black holes are rapidly spiralling together .",
    "rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) light curves were extracted from stretches of data in which the number of proportional counter units ( pcus ) on were consistent ( e.g. light curves during observations in which only 3 pcus were on were extracted separatedly from light curves during times when all 5 pcus were on ) .",
    "we combined these to produce the final light curve by scaling up to the level of 5 pcus all those light curves with less than 5 pcus on . due to the potential urgency to report our results we have used _ realtime _",
    "data for the analysis of the february data ; production data are used for the december data .",
    "good time intervals were selected to exclude any earth occultations or south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) passage and to ensure stable pointing .",
    "we generated our background data using pcabackest v1.5 in order to estimate the internal background caused by interactions between the radiation or particles and the detector or spacecraft at the time of observation .",
    "this was done by matching the conditions of observations with those in various model files .",
    "the model files that we chose were constructed using the vle rate ( one of the rates in pca standard 2 science array data that is defined to be the rate of events which saturate the analog electronics ) as the tracer of the particle background .",
    "1 shows the background subtracted pca light curve in the 410 kev band for both observations in 1997 december and 1998 february .",
    "in the same manner as for the analysis of the asca data , we used the lomb algorithm ( lomb 1976 ; press et al 1992 ) to determine the power spectra of the rxte lightcurves ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "there is a clear peak in the first power spectrum , at @xmath3 ( 11.0  hr ) in december 1997 and several peaks in february 1998 .",
    "the highest of these is at @xmath4 ( 11.2  hr ) , very close to the december peak .",
    "the total amplitude of the signal is strong , being about 50 per cent ( see fig .  3 and 4 for folded light curves ) .",
    "the arguments used in our previous work ( iwasawa et al 1998 ) for a periodicity in each dataset being a real property of the seyfert galaxy apply here and are strengthened by the higher power of the signal .",
    "we note that the power spike around @xmath5 seen in the spectrum of the february data is at the orbital period of the satellite , and unlikely to be due to the source .",
    "we have examined the satellite housekeeping and other available data and can find no explanation for the main peaks in the power spectrum .",
    "the power spectrum of a 10 day long rxte observation of mcg6 - 30 - 15 in august 1997 shows no distinct peaks ( it shows much red noise , as expected ) .",
    ".mean flux and period for x - ray observations of iras  18325 - 5926 .",
    "the ginga data are reported by iwasawa et al ( 1995 ) .",
    "the error bars indicate the period change over which the power drops by a factor of two from the peak .",
    "1998a and b refer to the highest and next highest peaks in the february power spectrum , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ , > \" , ]     the x - ray emission from iras  18325 - 5926 oscillates in a manner similar to that seen in bhc qpo .",
    "such a large clear oscillation from matter around a black hole may suggest that we are detecting the fundamental frequency of some space - filling corona above the disk",
    ". this may be possible if the corona has a proton temperature close to the virial value and a lower electron temperature ( see e.g. di matteo , blackman & fabian 1997 ) .",
    "of course this must happen over a very restricted range of radii in order that a single dominant oscillation is seen .",
    "perhaps it corresponds to the radius where the surface emission from the disk peaks ( i.e. @xmath67 schwarzschild radii for a non - spinning hole ) .",
    "the variation of period with flux ( fig .",
    "5 ) is similar to that seen in some qpo .    otherwise , as mentioned by iwasawa et al ( 1998 )",
    ", it could be due to the bardeen - petterson effect if the angular momentum vectors of the black hole and accreting matter are not aligned . a range of radii",
    "are then selected over which the accretion disk tilts over to match the equatorial plane of the black hole .",
    "( the disk is not actually precessing in this case ; markovic & lamb 1998 . )",
    "reflection / obscuration by blobs of gas in the tilt zone might then lead to observed flux variations , especially if the inclination is fairly high ( as the broad iron line may indicate ; iwasawa et al 1996 ) , but we consider it unlikely that 50 per cent variations can be obtained in this way .    the data are consistent with a continuous decrease of period with time from ginga observations in 1989 to december 1997 , and continuing if the second highest peak in the february power spectrum is used .",
    "this raises the possibility that the period is due to a massive object orbiting the black hole ( see cunningham & bardeen 1973 ) .",
    "the separation of the objects requires that this second object is compact .",
    "the period decrease is then explained as due to orbital energy loss by the emission of gravitational waves ( as for the binary pulsar ) . the rate of period change @xmath7 where @xmath8 , the sum of the separate masses , and @xmath9 this integrates to give @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the time when the masses finally merge .",
    "we have fitted this last relation to the data and find an acceptable fit ( fig .",
    "it suggests that the merger may occur in late april 1998 .",
    "the rate of spiral - in enables us to estimate that the product @xmath12 where the masses are in units of @xmath13 .",
    "this means that for @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "there is no solution for @xmath16 .",
    "much of the energy from such a merger would emerge as gravitational waves , but some is likely throughout the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "we note that it is _ a priori _ unlikely to find an object close in time to a spiral - in merger event .",
    "possibilities that can enhance that probability are if a ) black holes are built out of many merger events where the basic unit has a mass of only a few @xmath17 ( say from dwarf galaxies ) and b ) the inspiralling black hole switches on , or significantly enhances , an otherwise quiescent active nucleus .",
    "if we make the extreme argument that this process happens in all galaxies of space density @xmath18 , all of which have a central black hole of mass @xmath19 growing by the addition of smaller black holes of @xmath20 , then a merger will take place within @xmath21 ( the distance to iras18325 - 5926 ) every @xmath22 .",
    "we therefore see that such an event is not completely improbable but is unlikely .",
    "the probability that we should find the signal of a merger in its last year ( it was the asca result of an observation in 1997 march which alerted us to make the rxte observations ) is @xmath23",
    ". such mergers would of course be more common at fainter flux levels ( @xmath24 within 1 gpc ) , and the prospects for space - based gravitational wave astronomy ( which will be sensitive to events in massive black holes ) could be very positive .    a lower mass black hole captured by a central black hole is likely initially to have a highly eccentric orbit ( sigurdsson 1997 ) . when the eccentricity @xmath25 is high , the above estimates for @xmath26 are dramatically increased ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) , for example by a factor of 1001000 when @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "this allows @xmath28 to be much lower than estimated above for a circular orbit ( it can be as low as about @xmath29 ) .",
    "the overall temporal behaviour of the system is then more complex ( @xmath25 decreases with time )",
    ". it may be difficult for a low mass black hole to modulate the observed x - ray emission greatly ; this problem is offset by the enhanced probability of such an event occurring .",
    "we stress that this last , exciting , interpretation involving an in - spiralling black hole is unlikely and depends upon the identification of the second highest power peak in the february 1998 data with the orbital period of the second black hole .",
    "it does not explain the other peaks in the power spectrum nor why some peaks expected in the lightcurve do not occur .",
    "we discuss it here only because of its potential importance . clearly further observations are urgently required .",
    "even if such observations fail to show a consistently decreasing period , iras1832 - 5926 has a convincing , high - amplitude , qpo , which requires explanation .",
