    "a domino is the union of any two unit squares sharing an edge , and a domino tiling of a region is a covering of the region by dominoes so that there are no gaps or overlaps .",

    "the non - tileability of the region @xmath6 becomes evident if we look at the checkerboard representation of @xmath6 ( see figure [ fig : check ] ) .",

    "motivated by the recent work of ciucu and fischer @xcite , here we look at the problem of tiling an aztec rectangle with dominoes if arbitrary unit squares are removed along the boundary of the aztec rectangle .",

    "we just need to verify that the quantities expressed in equation are indeed given by the formulas described in the statement of theorem [ mt1 ] .",
    "the first statement follows immediately by noting that the added squares on the south eastern side of @xmath221 forces some domino tilings . after removing this forced dominoes",
    "we are left with an aztec diamond of order @xmath7 as shown in figure [ fig : mt11 ] , whose number of tilings is given by theorem [ adm ] .",
    "the possibilities in the second statement are as follows .",
    "if an @xmath20 square shares an edge with some @xmath224 , then the region can not be covered by any domino as illustrated in the right image of figure [ fig : mt12 ] . again",
    ", if @xmath37 is on the northwestern side at a distance of atmost @xmath15 from the western corner , then the strips of forced dominoes along the sourthwestern side interfere with the @xmath37 and hence there can not be any tiling in this case as illustrated in the left image of figure [ fig : mt12 ] . if neither of these situation is the case , then due to the squares @xmath225 on the southeastern side , there are forced dominoes as shown in figure [ fig : mt13 ] and then @xmath37 and @xmath226 are defects on an aztec diamond on adjacent sides and then the second statement follows from proposition [ ad_i_j ] .",
    "to prove the validity of the third statement , we notice that if an @xmath20 and @xmath30 defect share an edge then , there are two possibilities , either the @xmath20 defect is above the @xmath30 defect in which case we have some forced dominoes as shown in the left of figure [ fig : al - ga - yes ] and we are reduced to finding the number of domino tilings of an aztec diamond ; or the @xmath20-defect is to the left of a @xmath30-dent , in which case , we get no tilings as shown in the left of figure [ fig : al - ga - no ] as the forced dominoes interfere in this case .    if @xmath37 and @xmath227 share no edge in common , then we get no tiling if the @xmath20-defect is on the northwestern side at a distance of atmost @xmath40 from the western corner as illustrated in the right of figure [ fig : al - ga - no ] .",
    "if the @xmath20-defect is in the northwestern side at a distance more than @xmath40 from the western corner then the situation is as shown in the right of figure [ fig : al - ga - yes ] and is described in proposition [ ar_k-1_i ] .",
    "if the @xmath20-defect is in the southeastern side then the situation is as shown in the middle of figure [ fig : al - ga - yes ] and is described in proposition [ ar_k_i ] .     and @xmath30-defects that lead to tiling of @xmath221,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath30-defects that lead to tiling of @xmath221,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath30-defects that lead to tiling of @xmath221,title=\"fig : \" ]    the fourth statement follows immediately from the checkerboard drawing ( see figure [ fig : check ] ) of an aztec rectangle and the condition that a tiling by dominoes exists for such a board if and only if the number of white and black squares are the same .",
    "in all other cases , the number of tilings is @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath228 be the region obtained from @xmath221 by removing @xmath15 of the squares @xmath42 .",
    "we now apply theorem [ condensation ] to the planar dual graph of @xmath228 , with the removed squares choosen to be the vertices corresponding to the @xmath0 @xmath37 s inside @xmath228 and to @xmath43 .",
    "the left hand side of equation is now the required number of tilings and the right hand side of equation is the pfaffian of a @xmath45 matrix with entries of the form @xmath229 , where @xmath37 is not one of the unit squares that we removed from @xmath221 to get @xmath228 .",
    "we now notice that @xmath229 is an aztec rectangle with all its defects confined to three of the sides .",
    "so , we can apply theorem [ mt1 ] and it gives us an expression for @xmath229 as the pfaffian of a @xmath46 matrix of the type described in the statement of theorem [ mt1 ]",
    ".    we shall now apply theorem [ condensation ] to the planar dual graph of @xmath49 with removed squares choosen to correspond to @xmath230 .",
    "the right hand side of equation is precisely the right hand side of equation .",
    "if @xmath231 and @xmath232 are of the same type then @xmath233 does not have any tiling as the number of black and white squares in the checkerboard setting of an aztec diamond will not be the same ( see figure [ fig : check ] ) .",
    "finally , the proof is complete once we note that @xmath234 is an aztec diamond with two defects removed from adjacent sides for any choice of @xmath37 and @xmath226 and is given by proposition [ ad_i_j ] ."
