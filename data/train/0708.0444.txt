    "quantum entanglement , typically defined as the non - local quantum correlation between the measured degrees of freedom of separate quantum particles , is now being recognized as the key element in the emerging field of quantum information . for photons ,",
    "entanglement in polarization , among other photonic degrees of freedom , is particularly important in quantum information because the polarization state , i.e. , the qubit , can be easily controlled with linear optical elements , such as , a half - wave plate or a quarter - wave plate .    although many protocols in quantum information are developed on the assumption that photons could be made into a specific maximally entangled state easily , preparing a maximally entangled state , a bell - state ,",
    "experimentally is not a trivial problem even in the case of two photons . to illustrate the problem more clearly ,",
    "consider a bell - state of two photons , @xmath0 , where the subscripts refer to two separate photons . to prepare this state , it is necessary to ensure that the two two - photon probability amplitudes @xmath1 and @xmath2 exist with equal magnitudes , i.e. , the normalized coefficients equal to @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , these amplitudes should be absent of any distinguishing information so that the amplitudes are coherently superposed with the fixed phase difference of 0 modulo @xmath4 .",
    "experimentally , the coherent superposition between the two amplitudes could be tested by observing the quantum interference effects .",
    "ensuring that the two amplitudes are of perfectly equal magnitudes , however , is a challenging experimental problem due to the practical issues ( e.g. , spatial and spectral mode matching ) as well as many inherently fluctuating quantities ( e.g. , the detector dark counts , environmental noise , statistical fluctuations of the photon pair generation rate ) that affect the joint detection rates . in practice , therefore , an experimentally prepared two - photon entangled state may be close to the ideal bell - state but is often non - maximally entangled , even if all the distinguishing information is properly erased so that the state is pure .    in principle , entanglement concentration , i.e.",
    ", the process of trading @xmath5 pairs of non - maximally entangled qubits for a qubit pair in a bell - state , could be used to obtain a maximally entangled qubit pair @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that entanglement swapping could aid the process of entanglement concentration @xcite . in the recent years",
    ", a number of experimentally feasible linear optical entanglement concentration schemes for polarization ( non - maximally ) entangled photons have been proposed @xcite and demonstrated @xcite . for these schemes to really work ,",
    "however , the projection measurements whose outcomes signal the successful entanglement concentration ( i.e. , preparation of a maximally entangled photon pair ) must be performed with photon - number resolving detectors even in the case when the initial non - maximally entangled photon pairs are provided exactly as requested in the protocol .",
    "these schemes , therefore , rely on postselection of final four - photon detection events ( amplitudes ) , thereby always destroying the desired output state itself .",
    "recently , a non - postselection entanglement concentration scheme using polarizing beamsplitters and waveplates was proposed @xcite . in the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , entanglement concentration without postselection could be achieved as long as the input state ( two pairs of non - maximally entangled photons ) is supplied as requested .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new non - postselection entanglement concentration scheme .",
    "the present scheme is quite practical as it requires only ordinary 50/50 and polarizing beamsplitters .",
    "the noteworthy feature of this scheme is that it works not only for the @xmath6-type non - maximally polarization - entangled photons , but also for the other three bell - type non - maximally entangled states .     or @xmath7 signals successful preparation of photons @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the singlet bell - state @xmath10",
    ". an interesting feature of this scheme is that the initial state of the two photon pairs can be any one of the four non - maximally entangled states , including @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , pbs1 and pbs2 need not necessarily be used in the h - v basis .",
    "see text for details .",
    ", width=336 ]",
    "let us now consider the non - postselection entanglement concentration scheme shown in fig .",
    "photon pairs 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 are identically prepared in the non - maximally entangled state @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 . here , @xmath15 refer to the state of a horizontally polarized single - photon occupying the spatial mode @xmath16 .",
    "quite clearly , the initial quantum state of all four photons can be written as , @xmath17 next , photons 1 - 3 and 2 - 4 are made to interfere at the 50/50 beamsplitters bs1 and bs2 , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig ] . since",
    "independent photons are made to interfere in this scheme , it is necessary that photon 1 and photon 3 ( photon 2 and photon 4 ) must overlap at the beamsplitter bs1 ( bs2 ) perfectly .",
    "experimentally , this means that the photon pair sources must operate in the pulse mode and the pulse width should be less than the coherence time of the individual photons .    at the beamsplitters bs1 and bs2 , all the photons evolve according to the well - known untiary transformation relation for a lossless 50/50 beamsplitter , for example , @xmath18 .",
    "since photons in mode 1 and 3 ( 2 and 4 ) are made to interfere at bs1 ( bs2 ) , it is more convenient to rewrite the initial state as @xmath19 to calculate the quantum state after bs1 and bs2 , we apply the beamsplitter unitary transformation to each term in eq.([eq2 ] ) . when bs1 and bs2 unitary transformations are applied to the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , we find , @xmath20 where the normalization factor for a number state is properly taken into account .",
    "note that the unitary transformation described in eq.([unitary1 ] ) is in fact due to hong - ou - mandel interference as all the photons have the same polarization @xcite .",
    "similarly , for the second term in eq.([eq2 ] ) , we have @xmath21 finally , for the third and the fourth terms in eq.([eq2 ] ) , we have , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the singlet bell state .",
    "the quantum state of the photons after bs1 and bs2 unitary transformations , given the initial input state shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , can be found by substituting eq .",
    "( [ unitary1])@xmath24eq .",
    "( [ unitary4 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the properly normalized quantum state of photons after bs1 and bs2 is , therefore , given as , @xmath25    equation ( [ eq3 ] ) can be expressed in a more compact form by using the non - maximally entangled state notation we introduced earlier , i.e. , @xmath26 , where the subscripts @xmath16 and @xmath27 refer to the output modes of bs1 and bs2 . using this notation , the quantum state of photons after bs1 and bs2",
    "can then be expressed in a simple form as , @xmath28 the quantum state in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) exhibits interesting and important properties related to non - postselection entanglement concentration .",
    "first , the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , @xmath29 , indicates that previously unrelated photons @xmath30-@xmath31 and @xmath8-@xmath9 are now entangled in the singlet bell - states , i.e. , entanglement swapping has occurred .",
    "the presence of this amplitude is the key element of the entanglement concentration .",
    "second , the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) is the only ampliude with exactly one photon occupying each output mode of bs1 and bs2",
    ". this interesting feature of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) will be exploited to accomplish non - postselection entanglement concentration .",
    "now that we have calculated the quantum state of the photons at the output modes ( @xmath30 , @xmath8 , @xmath31 , and @xmath9 ) of bs1 and bs2 , let us discuss how to accomplish non - postselection entanglement concentration .",
    "quite clearly from eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , the singlet bell - state measurement ( bsm ) on the photon pair @xmath30-@xmath31 would project the photon pair @xmath8-@xmath9 to the maximally entangled singlet bell - state , @xmath10 .",
    "so , if the singlet bsm can indeed be performed on the previously uncorrelated photons @xmath30 and @xmath31 , its outcome can be used to signal successful preparation of the singlet bell - state for photons @xmath8-@xmath9 .    the problem ,",
    "however , is that the bsm is experimentally non - trivial and the complete bsm for photons require non - linear photon - photon interaction @xcite . since our scheme requires only the singlet bsm , one may try to use the linear optical singlet bsm scheme : by interfering photons @xmath30 and @xmath31 at a 50/50 beamsplitter and detecting coincidence at the output ports of this beamsplitter @xcite .",
    "this approach would not work in our scheme either because the coincidence event could equally likely come from the first four amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "for example , the @xmath32 amplitude could cause the linear optical singlet bsm to trigger spuriously as there are two photons in mode @xmath30 .",
    "since these spurious coincidence counts are indistinguishable from the desired ones , the conventional linear optical singlet bsm method can not be applied in our scheme to accomplish non - postselection entanglement concentration .",
    "there exists , however , a simple projection measurement whose outcomes would deterministically signal successful preparation of the singlet bell - state in modes @xmath8-@xmath9 provided that the input state is given exactly as in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . to see how this projection measurement works ,",
    "let us first re - express eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) as , @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "here we have expressed the singlet bell - state @xmath35 in the h - v basis but it makes no difference to choose another basis , such as , rotated - linear or circular basis .    if we now make the following joint polarization projection measurement ( i.e. , coincidence measurement ) on photons @xmath30 and @xmath31 , photons @xmath8 and @xmath9 will be found in the singlet bell - state : @xmath36 the non - postselection nature of this scheme comes from the fact that the projection measurement described in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) only affects the desired amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "that is , there are no spurious measurement outcomes as long as the input state ( two identical pairs of non - maximally entangled photons ) is provided as requested in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the experimental scheme to implement this projection measurement is shown in fig .",
    "polarizing beamsplitters pbs1 and pbs2 are placed ( in the h - v basis ) at the output ports of bs1 . at each output port of pbs1 and pbs2 ,",
    "a single - photon detector is installed and coincidence events between detectors @xmath37 and @xmath38 are recorded . since the joint projection measurement is for the spatial modes @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath39 amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) contributes no unwanted spurious coincidence events .",
    "therefore , a coincidence event between the detectors @xmath37 or @xmath38 signals a successful projection or preparation of photons @xmath8 and @xmath9 into the singlet bell state , deterministically .",
    "the present non - postselection entanglement concentration scheme has a few interesting features that we wish to point out .",
    "first , the joint projection measurement using pbs1 and pbs2 need not be done in the h - v basis . a rotated - linear basis , such as , @xmath40-@xmath41 basis , or a circular basis",
    "@xmath42-@xmath43 would work equally well . here",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the singlet bell - state is rotationally invariant so that it retains its form in any basis , i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , instead of inserting pbs1 and pbs2 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig ] , one could use any kind of polarization projection devices as long as the coincidence circuits detect orthogonally polarized photons in modes @xmath30 and @xmath31 , e.g. , @xmath49 and @xmath50 or @xmath51 and @xmath52 . and",
    ", regardless of the measurement choice , the output state remains to be the singlet bell - state .",
    "the second interesting feature of the present scheme is that it can be applied to any types of non - maximally entangled two - photon polarization states as long as two initial pairs of photons are identically prepared .",
    "this can be shown by substituting the input state in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with one of the other non - maximally entangled states . after some straightforward calculations",
    ", it can be shown that the output states are given as , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "since the photon pairs @xmath30-@xmath31 and @xmath8-@xmath9 are in the same singlet bell - state regardless of the input state , we can apply the same projection measurement on photons @xmath30 and @xmath31 as before and the output photon pair in modes @xmath8 and @xmath9 will always be found in the singlet bell - state .    for the present non - postselection entanglement concentration scheme to work as described",
    ", the initial state must be provided as requested in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the initial non - maximally entangled photon pairs can be supplied probabilistically ( this will only reduce the success probability ) , but there should not be any double - pair events from any of two the sources .",
    "should there be two pairs of non - maximally entangled photons either in modes @xmath57-@xmath58 or @xmath59-@xmath60 , the projection measurement outcomes would now contain spurious coincidence events that come from these double - pair events and the output photon pair in modes @xmath8-@xmath9 would no longer be in the singlet bell - state , similarly to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "therefore , if this scheme is implemented using spontaneous parametric down - conversion sources @xcite , the non - postselection nature of the scheme can not be utilized due to the inherent multi - pair events probabilities of spdc @xcite .",
    "the proposed non - postselection entanglement concentration scheme , however , could be implemented in full using recently reported semiconductor quantum - dot entangled photon sources in which the multi - pair events could be suppressed @xcite .",
    "we have discussed a practical scheme for non - postselection entanglement concentration using 50/50 beamsplitters , polarizing beamsplitters and conventional photon detectors .",
    "the scheme has the success probability less than 25% given two identical pairs of non - maximally entangled photons but the successful projection measurement deterministically prepares the output photon pair in the singlet bell - state . in addition , unlike other entanglement concentration schemes discussed previously , the present scheme works for all non - maximally entangled two - photon polarization entangled states as the input .",
    "a possible drawback of this scheme is that , due to the specific nature of quantum interference and the projection measurement used in this scheme , it may not be well suited as a long - distance entanglement repeater .",
    "we , however , believe that this scheme will have applications in experimental implementation of various quantum information protocols , which require high - quality deterministic sources of two - photon bell - states .",
