    "spin dependent deep - inelastic lepton - hadron scattering has received much interest during the past years , see refs.@xcite for reviews .",
    "presently , next - to - leading order analyses of the experimental data for the structure function @xmath4 allow for the extraction of polarized parton distributions . however , these are considerably less constrained than their unpolarized counterparts .",
    "this is particularly true for the gluon spin distribution @xmath5 , which is currently determined from scaling violations .",
    "numerous polarized hard scattering processes are sensitive to the gluon spin distribution , and the first moment of @xmath5 contributes to the sum rule for the nucleon s spin content  @xcite .",
    "deep - inelastic leptoproduction of heavy quarks proceeds predominantly through the boson - gluon fusion process , and as such yields important information about the gluon distribution inside the proton .",

    "in general , fixed target experiments , such as hermes or compass with centre - of - mass energies of @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , operate rather close to the threshold for charm pair - production . in this region of phase space , the perturbatively calculable hard scattering cross section has potentially large higher order double - logarithmic threshold corrections . thus",
    ", a resummation of these sudakov logarithms to all orders in perturbation theory is required in order to regain control over the perturbative expansion .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to carry out this sudakov resummation , which is done in section  [ crosssectionsection(sic ! ) ] .",
    "we work to next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy ( see ref.@xcite for a recent review ) , and our final result provides an approximate sum of the complete perturbative expansion if , at each order , the sudakov corrections dominate .",
    "previously , studies of threshold resummation for polarized scattering processes have been performed for the polarized drell - yan cross section in ref.@xcite . by re - expanding our resummed cross section in @xmath8 to next - to - leading ( nlo ) and",
    "next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , we provide in section  [ finitesection ] estimates of the size of the exact higher order corrections , the calculation of which has not yet been completed  @xcite .",

    "we have chosen to rewrite the standard expression for the convolution of @xmath1 in a form , that facilliates the investigation of partonic threshold effects on @xmath1 .",

    "@xmath108 however , these deviations increase and indicate that our approximate methods fail for @xmath114 .",
    "in fig.[g1c - xdep1]b we repeat the plot of @xmath109 for the same parameters as in fig.[g1c - xdep1]a but with the gluon density gs  c of ref.@xcite . again , the perturbative corrections are sizable over the whole range in @xmath108 , but the shape of the curves is completely different .",
    "both the coefficient functions and the gluon density oscillate , which leads in particular at intermediate @xmath108 around @xmath115 to destructive interference , with @xmath1 being only marginally different from zero .",

    ", leading order calculations exhibit a strong sensitivity on the factorization scale , which is usually reduced once higher order corrections are taken into account .",
    "in addition , there are general arguments supporting a reduction in scale dependence from including soft gluon effects  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we are interested in the effect of our nll - approximate nlo and nnlo results ( [ oneloopk ] ) and ( [ twoloopk ] ) on the scale dependence of @xmath1 in comparision to the leading order calculation  @xcite .",
    "note however , that the arguments of ref.@xcite leading to genuine nlo soft gluon resummations rely on nnll accuracy , which is not yet available for @xmath1 , see footnote [ footnotethree ] .",
    "we plot the ratio @xmath116 over a range @xmath117 and fix @xmath118 , @xmath111 and @xmath119 . in fig.[g1c - mudep1]a",
    "we use the parametrization gs  a of ref.@xcite , but the following conclusions hold also for the gluon density in the valence scenario of ref.@xcite .",
    "we find at nlo that the corrections based on ll accuracy only are not sufficient to reduce the scale dependence .",
    "clearly , soft gluon effects need to be approximated at least to nll accuracy to achieve the desired result , a feature that has also been noticed in studies of unpolarized heavy quark production @xcite .",
    "our best estimate for @xmath1 makes use of the exact expression for the coefficient function @xmath120 of eq.([ex - dc11 ] ) .",
    "however , since it differs only slightly from the nlo result to nll accuracy for the chosen parameters in fig.[g1c - mudep1 ] , we do not display it here .    in fig.[g1c - mudep1]b",
    "we repeat the analysis for the parametrization gs  c of ref.@xcite . in this case",
    ", the nlo and nnlo approximations do not reduce the scale dependence .",
    "this is due to the oscillating gluon density , which leads to @xmath1 being close to zero at the @xmath108-value chosen , and even causes @xmath1 to change sign , depending on the scale .",
    "to summarize , the study of the charm structure function as in figs.[g1c - xdep1 ] and [ g1c - mudep1 ] shows that the soft gluon estimates of higher order corrections to the coefficient functions are well under control and give stable predictions for @xmath1 at scales @xmath88 not too large and @xmath106 . on the other hand , in the chosen kinematical range the effects of higher orders do not upset the sensitivity to the polarized gluon distribution function , with different gluon parametrizations leading to qualitatively different behaviour for @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , measurements of the charm structure function allow to further constrain the polarized gluon density .",
    "finally , we found that the sizable variation of @xmath1 at leading order due to different values of the charm mass are not reduced by our approximate higher order corrections .",
    "in this letter we have investigated the effects of soft gluons in the case of polarized leptoproduction of heavy quarks .",
    "our study helps to keep theoretical control to next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy over large higher order corrections due to threshold logarithms and we have presented analytical results for the all - order resummed cross section in single - particle inclusive kinematics .",
    "moreover , we have provided both analytical and numerical results for the approximate nlo and nnlo perturbative corrections to the deep - inelastic charm structure function @xmath1 , to nll accuracy . as a consequence of the scattering reaction being largely driven by initial state gluons with not much more energy than required to produce the final state ,",
    "we have found our analysis of @xmath1 to be well applicable in the kinematical range accessible to the hermes and compass experiments . in this region , our nlo and nnlo estimates can help to reduce theoretical uncertainties and may assist in the theoretical interpretation of future @xmath1 measurements ."
