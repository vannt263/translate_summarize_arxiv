    "the archimedean ( arch ) tilings were first elucidated and published by kepler ( a translation of which can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "these lattices received their name from references in kepler s paper to archimedes descriptions of regular solid polyhedra , which are related to these 2d lattices .",
    "the significance of the arch tilings or lattices , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is that they are the complete set of lattices having infinite tessellation in which all vertices are equivalent .",
    "( they are also called  uniform \" lattices . )",
    "this property has made them useful in the study of mathematics @xcite , crystallization @xcite , statistical mechanics @xcite , as well as percolation @xcite .",
    "the familiar square , triangular , honeycomb and kagom lattices are all arch .",
    "the primary goal of this study was to determine precise values of the site percolation threshold @xmath0 for all arch lattices for which accurate values were not previously known .",
    "a few years ago , diribarne , et al .   determined @xmath0 for all but one of the arch lattices ( which they call  mosaics \" ) to about three significant figures @xcite , using a method based upon the analysis of the minimum spanning tree of clusters @xcite . more recently",
    "van der marck ( vdm ) @xcite determined the thresholds for three of these lattices to nearly four figures .",
    "furthermore , the threshold for the honeycomb lattice , a common one for percolation studies , was previously known only to about four figures @xcite . here , we extend the precision of these thresholds to six significant figures",
    ". we did not consider the square , triangular , and kagom lattices , as @xmath0(site ) is either known exactly ( triangular and kagom @xcite ) , or has already been measured to a high degree of precision ( square @xcite ) for these cases .",
    "the second goal of this study was to explore the dependence of @xmath0 upon lattice characteristics and determine to what extent a universal formula can be found for 2d site percolation .",
    "recently there has been renewed interest in this question with the extensive work of galam and mauger ( gm ) @xcite and vdm @xcite .",
    "the arch lattices provide an excellent resource for studying this question because they possess a range of coordination numbers from 3 to 6 and a variety of other lattice characteristics .",
    "unfortunately , neither kepler nor archimedes ( nor anyone else to our knowledge ) assigned common names to all the arch lattices .",
    "however , grnbaum and shephard @xcite have introduced a general notation , which we use here , to catagorize such lattices in terms of the set of polygons which surround each vertex , @xmath23 .",
    "going clockwise around a vertex , the numbers @xmath24 denote the number of sides of each polygon , and the superscript @xmath25 refers to the number of these polygons adjacent to each other .",
    "for example , the triangular lattice has six triangles around a given point , and is designated @xmath19 .",
    "the labels for all the arch lattices are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "note that the @xmath26 lattice has been called the  3 - 12 \" lattice in the literature , and in places the @xmath27 has been given the name of  bathroom tile \" lattice .",
    "for convenience in our work we did assign nicknames to the lattices , which are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the @xmath6 is called the  cross \" lattice because of the cross in fig .  [",
    "fig3 ] ; the @xmath27 lattice is named after our local shopping mall , briarwood , which ( like many such malls ) has tiles of this shape on its floor ; @xmath28 is called the  direct \" lattice because of its directed structure , etc .",
    "the origins of the rest of the names are , we hope , somewhat more obvious .",
    "to find @xmath0 we employ the hull - gradient method @xcite , which we previously used to determine @xmath0 for site percolation on the square lattice @xcite and for bond percolation on the kagom lattice @xcite , both to more than six significant digits of precision .    in gradient",
    "percolation @xcite , a linear gradient of occupied sites is applied in the vertical direction of the lattice . as the height increases , the concentration of occupied sites also increases .",
    "this gradient forms two `` land masses '' within the lattice : a continuous region of occupied sites located at the top of the lattice and a continuous region of vacant sites located at the bottom ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the boundary between these two regions forms a path whose average height provides an estimate for @xmath0 .    to make this method efficient for finding @xmath0",
    ", we employ a hull - generating walk @xcite which simultaneously generates and identifies the interfacial boundary .",
    "the status ( whether occupied or vacant ) of a site encountered by the walk is determined by generating a random number and comparing that number with the occupation probability for that height .",
    "if the walk does not arrive at a given site , the status of that site will not be determined , and no random number will be generated for it , contributing to the efficiency .",
    "in fact , we believe that the hull - gradient method is the most efficient way to determine @xmath0 for 2d lattices .",
    "it is also quite simple to program , as it involves no lists or cluster labelling algorithms .    for each gradient @xmath29 , an estimate of @xmath0",
    "may also be obtained by taking the ratio of occupied to total ( occupied plus vacant perimeter ) sites belonging to the hull @xcite . as the size of the system",
    "is increased or the gradient is decreased , @xmath30 approaches @xmath0 linearly in @xmath29 .",
    "thus a simple extrapolation of the data for finite gradients gives the infinite - system value . in practice",
    ", we considered gradients sufficiently small ( typically of the order of @xmath31 @xmath32/lattice spacing ) that the extrapolation from the final point to zero gradient was of the order of the error bars of that last point .",
    "additional details of the method are given in @xcite .",
    "in the simulation , the status of all points visited by the walk must be stored in computer memory . to accomplish this efficiently ,",
    "all of the arch lattices were transformed to align on rectilinear grids , as shown in fig .",
    "note that the gradient was not applied directly to these squared - off forms , as some lattices had to be distorted in the vertical direction to get them in this form .",
    "instead , all numerical calculations were performed so that the height of the point in the original , undistorted , lattice was used to find @xmath33 .",
    "previously we showed , for bond percolation on the kagom lattice , that assigning @xmath33 this way yields the best linear scaling of @xmath0 vs.gradient @xcite . for two lattices , we considered two possible orientations of the lattice and found similar results ,",
    "as discussed in appendix a.    the lattices were initialized by filling the top half of the first column with occupied sites and the lower half with vacant sites , which prevents the walk from closing on itself at the start of the algorithm ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were applied in the horizontal direction , and each new column to the right was cleared as it was visited .",
    "this allowed the simulation to run indefinitely and have essentially no boundary effects from the horizontal ends of the system .",
    "the maximum distance the walk traveled horizontally from the front was tracked to detect if wraparound errors occurred ; if they did , the system size and/or gradient was adjusted accordingly , and the run was restarted with the expanded system .",
    "random numbers were generated using the shift - register sequence generator r7(9689 ) @xcite defined by : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the bitwise exclusive - or operation .",
    "this ` four tap ' generator is equivalent to decimating by 7 ( taking every seventh term ) of the sequence generated by the two - tap rule r(9689 ) ( @xmath36 ) given by zierler @xcite , where the decimation has the effect of greatly reducing the three- and four - point correlations of the two - tap generator @xcite .",
    "our previous work has shown that this generator does not appear to introduce errors in simulations of this kind @xcite .",
    "for each lattice , @xmath0 was plotted as a function of the gradient .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows a representative plot for the @xmath4 lattice . in all cases ,",
    "a linear relationship was observed between the magnitude of the gradient and the estimate @xmath30 , as found previously for the square @xcite and kagom lattices @xcite .",
    "the value at the intercept of the @xmath37-axis represents @xmath0 for an infinite lattice ( zero gradient ) , and these values are reported in table [ table1 ] .",
    "also shown in table [ table1 ] is the quantity of random numbers generated for each simulation , which is identical to the total number of occupied and vacant sites belonging to the hull , because one random number is generated for each new site visited .",
    "these simulations consumed several months of computer time on sun and hp workstations .    for all our values , the error ( which is purely statistical in origin ) is of order @xmath38 . our results are consistent with diribarne et al.s three - digit values , if we assume an error of @xmath39 in their data .",
    "our result @xmath40 for the honeycomb lattice is consistent with the previous values 0.6973(8 ) of vicsek and kertsz @xcite , 0.6962(6 ) of djordjevic et al .",
    "@xcite , and 0.6971(2 ) of vdm @xcite .",
    "likewise , our results agree with the determinations 0.5504(2 ) for @xmath28 and 0.7298(1 ) for @xmath27 made recently by vdm @xcite .    in another recent work",
    ", pra @xcite has calculated the distance sequences @xmath41 , defined as the number of sites @xmath42 steps ( chemical distance ) from the origin , for the arch lattices .",
    "pra found a monotonic relation between @xmath0(site ) and @xmath43 , although three different lattices with different @xmath0  the square , kagom , and @xmath12  share the same value @xmath44 .",
    "this apparent monotonic behavior led pra to conjecture that @xmath0 for the @xmath45 lattice ( the one arch lattice not studied previously ) is within in interval @xmath46 .",
    "our result @xmath47 confirms this conjecture .",
    "the threshold for the @xmath4 can be derived exactly . the proof is based upon the similarity of structure between this lattice and the kagom lattice . in fig",
    ".  [ fig5 ] , the @xmath4 lattice is shown with the triangle bonds in bold and the bonds between the triangles as dashed lines . if the dashed lines are reduced in length , the @xmath4 lattice transforms into the kagom lattice .",
    "similarly , the sites on both ends of the dashed line in the @xmath4 ( marked by the large circle in the figure ) , taken together , are equivalent to a single point on the kagom lattice .",
    "let both lattices be at the percolation threshold and @xmath49 be the probability that a given site on the @xmath4 lattice is occupied .",
    "then , @xmath50 is the probability that both sites at the ends of the dashed bonds are occupied , and the bond will permit flow . the dashed bond is equivalent to a single point on the kagom . at the percolation threshold ,",
    "the probability that a site is occupied on the kagom lattice is @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , for the ( @xmath48 ) lattice , @xmath52^{1/2 } = 0.807\\,900\\,764\\ldots \\ . \\label{exact}\\ ] ] our numerical estimate @xmath3 is consistent with this result within the error bars @xmath53 .",
    "this agreement provides a further validation of both our algorithm and error analysis .",
    "early in the work of percolation , thresholds were related with coordination number @xmath54 using relatively simple formulas .",
    "more recently , gm @xcite have attempted to refine this by introducing different classes of lattices , characterized by the constants @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 in their formula @xmath58^{-a}d^{b } \\ , \\label{galam}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the dimensionality . by defining two different classes , each with distinct sets of constants @xmath55 and @xmath56 for site and bond percolation ( with @xmath60 for bond and @xmath61 for site percolation )",
    ", gm were able to obtain a fairly good fit of @xmath0 for a number of lattices of various dimensionality , with a fifth set of constants @xmath55 and @xmath56 required for systems of very high dimensionality .",
    "their class 1 contains all 2d lattices except the kagom , while class 2 comprises all higher - dimensional systems plus the 2d kagom .",
    "subsequently , vdm @xcite considered a number of additional lattices and argued that a formula of this type , depending only upon @xmath59 and @xmath54 , can not be very accurate because of the existence of different lattices with differing @xmath0 but identical @xmath59 and @xmath54 .",
    "gm @xcite responded that their formula is applicable only for  isotropic \" lattices in which each site has the identical @xmath54 .",
    "( in this present paper , we describe these lattices as  uniform , \" by which we mean that each vertex is identical in terms of its surrounding polygons , allowing for rotations and reflections . ) for other lattices , gm reformulated ( [ galam ] ) by reinterpreting @xmath54 to be an effective coordination number @xmath62 ( not necessarily the average value @xmath63 ) . because @xmath62 can not be found independently , this reinterpretation has the effect of turning their formula into a correlation between site and bond thresholds for a given lattice rather than a more general correlation for @xmath0 , which is developed further in @xcite and discussed in @xcite",
    "however , because we do not consider thresholds for bond percolation here , we do not address this aspect of gm s work in this paper .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we plot our results using the same axes as gm @xcite , ln(@xmath64 ) vs.  ln(@xmath65 ) .",
    "we also exhibit gm s two fitting formulas for site percolation , which are straight lines on this plot .",
    "clearly , many of the arch lattices do not fall near either of these two lines .",
    "evidently , gm s approach ( [ galam ] ) can not accommodate these additional uniform lattices , unless one introduces still more lattice classes , which is counter to the concept of universality .      for the arch lattices",
    ", one can observe the trend that @xmath0 increases with increasing  openness \" of the lattices . to characterize the latter",
    ", we introduce the quantity @xmath66 equal to the density or number of lattice sites per unit area , assuming that all bond lengths are unity .",
    "its inverse , the area per site , can be determined by drawing lines which bisect the centers of each polygon surrounding a given site , as in a dual - lattice construction , and summing the enclosed area .",
    "the tiles defined by these bisector lines clearly fill the entire lattice .",
    "the total area per site is simply 1/3 the area of each triangle , 1/4 the area of each square , etc .",
    ", surrounding that site . for arch lattices with uniform bond lengths ,",
    "all polygons are regular .",
    "the area of 1/@xmath42-th of a regular @xmath42-gon , with unit edge length , is given by @xmath67 with some numerical values given in table [ table4 ] .",
    "for a lattice characterized by vertices @xmath68 , we then have @xmath69^{-1 } = 4 \\left [ \\sum_{i } a_i \\cot { \\pi \\over n_i }",
    "\\right]^{-1 }   \\ . \\label{areatotal}\\ ] ]",
    "the resulting values of @xmath66 for the arch lattices are listed in table [ table2 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show a plot of @xmath0 vs.  @xmath66 , and indeed one can see that the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath66 is good .",
    "furthermore , that correlation can be well represented by a simple linear function .",
    "a least - squares fit yields @xmath70 the errors involved in using this formula are listed in the column @xmath71 in table [ table2 ] , and are generally within about 0.01 , in contrast to errors up to 0.05 if gm s correlations were used ( taking the best class in each case ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we plot the errors from using these different fitting formulas for the various lattices , clearly showing how gm s formulas are each accurate for certain lattices only , while ( [ fit ] ) works fairly well for all of the lattices .",
    "the rms errors from using ( [ fit ] ) for the 11 arch lattices equals 0.0075 .",
    "it turns out that our fit ( [ areatotal]-[fit ] ) is related to a correlation for @xmath0 given by scher and zallen nearly three decades ago @xcite .",
    "these authors introduced a  filling factor \" @xmath72 defined as the fraction of space occupied by disks of radius @xmath73 placed at each lattice site , and found for four lattices in 2d , @xmath74 now , @xmath72 is simply @xmath75 , so that their correlation also relates to the density of sites .",
    "however , while their hyperbolic relation ( [ sz ] ) provided a good fit to lattices they considered ( to the accuracy available at that time ) , it does not capture the behavior for the other lattices , especially those of low @xmath66 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where ( [ sz ] ) is also plotted .    fairly recently , diribarne et al .",
    "@xcite considered a correlation for @xmath0 of the arch lattices that is also closely related to @xmath66 or @xmath72 .",
    "they compared @xmath0 to a variable @xmath76 which represents the average edge length of a minimally spanning tree on a complete lattice , normalized by the area .",
    "because on the complete graph there is one edge per site , @xmath76 is identical to @xmath77 .",
    "their plot of @xmath0 vs. @xmath76 correlates the data to a single curve just as our fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] does , however , in terms of @xmath76 the behavior is quite curved , which diribarne et al .",
    "fit to the quadratic @xmath78 in fact , this fit reduces the rms error of our results over the 11 lattices to 0.0057 .",
    "( note , only a slight improvement is obtained by adjusting these coefficients for our new values of @xmath0 . )",
    "however , the expense of this improvement is an extra parameter in ( [ dirr ] ) over ( [ fit ] ) .",
    "indeed , one can also extend ( [ fit ] ) to a quadratic in @xmath66 , with the result @xmath79 which gives a comparable rms error over the 11 lattices , 0.0054 , but again at the expense of a more complicated formula than ( [ fit ] ) .    along these lines , it is interesting to note that an excellent fit can be achieved using results from only the three lattices where @xmath0 is known exactly ( which happen to span the whole range of @xmath0 values ) .",
    "that fit , @xmath80 yields an rms error over the 11 arch lattices of 0.0062 , only slightly worse than ( [ dirr ] ) or ( [ quadfit ] ) .",
    "this fitting formula depends upon no adjustable parameters nor any monte - carlo - measured values .",
    "we have found that ( [ areatotal]-[fit ] ) may also be applied to non - uniform lattices , if in calculating @xmath66 by ( [ areatotal ] ) , @xmath81 is interpreted as the _ average _ number of polygons of type @xmath42 over all vertices .",
    "for the non - uniform lattices ( also referred to as anisotropic @xcite ) , many of the polygons are not regular , and it is not always possible to make all bonds of the same length , which were the two assumptions in deriving ( [ areatotal ] ) .",
    "thus , we now consider ( [ areatotal ] ) to represent a topological or graphical weight rather than an actual geometric property of the lattices .",
    "we looked at seven non - uniform lattices considered by vdm @xcite and/or gm @xcite and whose values of @xmath0 are known ( we did not determine any of these @xmath0 s here ) : the bowtie , bowtie dual , pentagonal , @xmath27-matching , dice , penrose , and penrose dual lattices .",
    "the first five of these lattices are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonuniform ] , while the quasicrystalline penrose and penrose dual are shown for example in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the form of the penrose lattice used here is the rhomb or p3 form @xcite .    for the dice lattice , @xmath82 of the vertices are @xmath83",
    "while @xmath84 of them are @xmath85 , so on the average the vertices are @xmath18 .",
    "likewise for the @xmath27-matching , we have @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 , for the bowtie @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath28 , for the bowtie dual @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 , and for the pentagonal @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 . for the penrose lattice , the average vertices are simply @xmath18 , while for the penrose dual lattice the average vertices are @xcite @xmath97 with @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the inverse of the golden ratio",
    ". note that in general @xmath81 satisfy @xmath104 and @xmath105 , where @xmath63 is the average coordination number .",
    "these average vertex numbers are listed in table [ table3 ] , along with @xmath0 values , @xmath66 values , @xmath106 and error @xmath71 from using ( [ areatotal]-[fit ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath71 for all 7 of these lattices are generally smaller that those for the arch lattices  with an rms value of 0.0046 vs.  0.0075 .",
    "( note that some of these @xmath71 s are however close to the precision of the value of @xmath0 . )",
    "surprisingly , even the penrose dual lattice , which incorporates polygons with from 3 to 7 sides and a very irregular structure , is also well modelled by this formula .",
    "evidently , this approach , which is based upon @xmath66 given by ( [ areatotal ] ) , appears to be quite robust .",
    "one could conceivably use these additional data points from the non - uniform lattices to refine the fit of the formulas for @xmath107 in section [ section : formulas ] .",
    "however , the improvement turns out to be marginal , and considering the relatively low precision of the values of @xmath0 for the non - uniform lattices , the justification for doing this is doubtful .",
    "note that if one retained the definition of @xmath66 literally as the density of sites for these lattices , rather than using the definition above , then the fit of the non - uniform lattices with ( [ fit ] ) would be very poor .",
    "an example is given by the dice lattice , which has a site density identical to that of the triangular lattice , @xmath108 .",
    "the @xmath0 for this lattice , 0.5851 @xcite , is substantially above the value for the triangular , 1/2 , and the data point for this case would fall well above the line in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "it is also interesting to note that we have now considered three different lattices with the same average vertex environment of three triangles and two squares : the two arch lattices @xmath28 and @xmath109 , and the non - uniform bowtie lattice , which have @xmath0 s of @xmath15 , @xmath13 , and @xmath110 respectively .",
    "the closeness of these values supports the idea that @xmath0 is determined principally by the local nature of the lattice as characterized by the vertex numbers . for the two arch lattices , the @xmath0 s are nearly identical , and close to the prediction by ( [ fit ] ) of @xmath111 .",
    "the bowtie lattice , which has the same vertex numbers as the others on the average only , has a value of @xmath0 that is slightly lower , by about 0.003 .",
    "the inadequacy of using @xmath54 alone to estimate @xmath0 is also apparent , as the @xmath45 lattices has the same @xmath112 as these three above , but a @xmath0 that is substantially higher , @xmath9 .",
    "the results for the non - uniform lattices are also included in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , using @xmath63 for @xmath54 .",
    "a similar situation occurs for the square ( @xmath113 ) , dice ( @xmath114 ) , and penrose ( @xmath115 ) lattices , whose ( average ) vertices are @xmath18 in all cases .",
    "again , the non - uniform lattices have a slightly lower @xmath0 than the uniform one with the same vertices , with the  most \" non - uniform one ( the penrose ) having the lowest @xmath0 . and again , other lattices with @xmath116 but different average vertex numbers ( there are four of them here ) all have much different ( and higher ) @xmath0 s .",
    "van der marck has pointed out @xcite that adding an extra site at the center of any triangle on a 2d lattice does not change the value of @xmath0 ( site ) .",
    "if these extra sites are included in the calculation of @xmath66 , then @xmath66 would change and the predictions of [ fit ] would be poor .",
    "therefore , in applying these formulas , one must disregard these superfluous sites . however , there are undoubtedly other classes of lattices where [ areatotal]-[fit ] will not work well  and will not be so easily fixed .",
    "although a precise universal formula for @xmath0 based upon the vertex numbers alone is impossible , it is interesting to explore variations to ( [ areatotal]-[fit ] ) to see what improvements can be made . according to ( [ areatotal ] ) , the variable @xmath117 is an average over the nearest neighbors polygons weighted by @xmath118 . to see how close this weighting compares to an optimal one",
    ", we carried out a regression analysis , allowing all @xmath118 as well as the linear fit of @xmath107 to vary , and minimizing the error from the linear fit using data from all 18 lattices given above , both arch and non - uniform .",

    "however , we do not know what that weighting rule may be .    to test",
    "if a non - linear relation between @xmath0 and @xmath125 may be better , we carried out the same regression analysis as above , but allowed for a quadratic @xmath107 .",

    ", we found optimal weights @xmath119 now much closer to the @xmath118 .",
    "these various and partly contradictory results suggest that , while some improvements can be made , our original assumptions  that @xmath118 is the actual polygon area , and that @xmath107 is linear  are not unreasonable .    of course , there are deeper assumptions to this whole approach  that @xmath117 is a linear function of the @xmath81 , and that @xmath0 is a simple linear or quadratic function of @xmath66  which we have not explored . and",
    "ultimately , to get a more precise formula for @xmath0 , one must also take into account the actual arrangement of the polygons around each vertex , not just the number of each type of polygon .",
