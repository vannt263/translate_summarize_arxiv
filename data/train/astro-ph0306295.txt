    "lithium is one of the key elements related to stellar evolution and thermonuclear synthesis .",
    "it is both easily destroyed and easily produced at the temperatures found in stellar interiors .",
    "lithium undergoes nuclear burning at temperatures above about @xmath2k and primordial lithium is therefore destroyed in the convective atmospheres of late - type giants .",
    "fresh lithium can be produced and brought to the surface of agb stars via the beryllium transport mechanism proposed by @xcite . while the detailed determination of lithium abundances in agb star atmospheres is difficult , due to heavy line blanketing and",
    "non - lte effects , agb stars with unusually high abundances of lithium ( lithium rich @xmath3 and super lithium rich ( slr ) @xmath4 stars ) are known both in the galaxy and in the magellanic clouds ; although the two environments seem to produce lithium enrichment in different types of agb star ( see below ) .    in the magellanic clouds @xcite found 35 lithium - rich stars .",
    "the majority of these are s - type stars while a small fraction are c stars ; the paucity of c - type slr stars in the lmc compared to the galaxy was recently confirmed by @xcite .",
    "most of the lithium - rich stars in the magellanic clouds lie in the luminosity range @xmath5 mag and their enrichment can be explained as a consequence of hot bottom burning ( hbb ) , in stars with initial masses of @xmath6 , as described by @xcite .",
    "these slr stars have rather thin dust shells ( possibly a selection effect ) and those which are also large amplitude variables have periods over 400 days and are more luminous than the mira period - luminosity relation would predict ( whitelock et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "a rather small number of slr s ( e.g. rz sgr , t sgr , vx aql , he 166 ) and c ( e.g. t ara , iy hya , wz cass , wx cyg ) stars are known in the galaxy , a much larger fraction of them being c stars than in the magellanic clouds and some are j - type c stars ( i.e. they have high @xmath7c/@xmath8c ) ; see catchpole & feast ( 1971,1976 ) and @xcite .",
    "the distances , and therefore the luminosities , of these galactic slr stars are uncertain , but the evidence favours their evolving from lower mass progenitors than those of the hbb stars in the magellanic clouds . @xcite discuss possible mechanisms for mixing lithium to the surface in low mass stars , but a full explanation for their enrichment remains elusive .",
    "@xcite have reported preliminary results from a lithium survey of iras selected agb variables which shows that lithium is preferentially found in stars with long periods , @xmath9d , large expansion velocities , @xmath10kms@xmath11 , and relatively thin dust shells , @xmath12-[25]<0 $ ] ( although this is largely a selection effect as most of those with thicker shells could not be observed spectroscopically ) .",
    "furthermore these are all oxygen - rich , although not s - type stars , and could be related to the hbb stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "however , insufficient information is presented to judge their luminosities and or the level of their lithium enrichment .",
    "lithium is also found in the close binary systems hd 172481 and hd 190390 ( reyniers 2002 ) where its origin is not understood .    in this note",
    "we report on the lii 6708  doublet identification in the spectrum of the symbiotic mira v407cyg .",
    "the symbiotic miras are binary systems in which an asymptotic giant branch variable interacts with a white dwarf ; these are rare objects , fewer than 28 are known in the galaxy and lmc ( whitelock 1987 , 2003 ) .",
    "the agb star looses mass to the white dwarf via its stellar wind , while a circumbinary nebulae reaches ionization levels comparable to those found in planetary nebulae .",
    "their binary periods are assumed to be long , in excess of 10 years , while the pulsation periods of the agb stars range from 275 to 745 days .",
    "v407cyg was identified as symbiotic mira by munari , margoni & stagni ( 1990 ) ; at 745 days its pulsation period is the longest known in a symbiotic mira .",
    "most symbiotic miras suffer from strong and variable circumstellar extinction .",
    "v407cyg is an exception , it has surprisingly low circumstellar extinction given its long period and symbiotic character . according to the intensity of the tio 7055  band",
    "the mira can be classified as m6-m7 .",
    "vo absorption bands are also present in its spectrum .",
    "therefore the cool component of v407cyg is oxygen",
    "rich ( kolotilov et al . 1998 ) .",
    "note that if we accept that the late - type giant in v407cyg is a mira variable then we must also accept that it is an agb star .",
    "mira variables obey a period - luminosity relation ( e.g. whitelock et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) and even the short period miras , found in globular clusters , have luminosities above the tip of the first giant branch ( e.g. feast & whitelock 1987 ) .",
    "the kinematics of agb variables shows that their pulsation periods are a function of the population to which they belong , with longer period stars being younger ( e.g. feast & whitelock 2000 ) .",
    "not much is known about stars with periods over 700 days , but by analogy with olivier , whitelock & marang ( 2001 ) we can estimate that an agb star on the period - luminosity relation with a period of 745 days would have had a progenitor of around 2@xmath13 .",
    "if , however , it is undergoing hbb then its initial mass could be quite different and presumably larger than this .",
    "normal miras , i.e. those not undergoing hbb , obey a period - luminosity relation which has proved useful for determining distances within the galaxy .",
    "hbb miras are over - luminous ( whitelock et al .",
    "2003 ) and the pl relation will therefore underestimate their distances .",
    "high - resolution spectra ( @xmath14 ) of v407cyg have been obtained with the echelle spectrograph mounted at the cassegrain focus of the 1.82 m telescope which is operated by the padova and asiago astronomical observatories on mt .",
    "ekar ( asiago , italy ) .",
    "the detector was a thomson thx31156 ccd with 1024@xmath151024 19 @xmath16 m pixels , and the slit width was set to 1.8 arcsec .",
    "the spectra cover the 4500 - 9000range .",
    "the reduction and analysis of the spectra was performed in the standard fashion under iraf .",
    "figure1 illustrates a fraction of the v407cyg spectrum around the line we suspect to be lithium .",
    "mindful of the possible confusion of the lii doublet at 6707.76  and 6707.91  with ceii at 6708.099 as discussed by reyniers et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the wavelength of the feature was checked in detail .",
    "the radial velocity of v407cyg was established for three spectra by cross - correlating a 200  continuum strip in the vicinity of the line in question with a similar region from hd18884 , an m2iii radial velocity standard with @xmath17kms@xmath11 ; a few telluric lines were masked out .",
    "the measurements are accurate to about @xmath18kms@xmath11 .",
    "table  1 details the velocity derived for v407cyg from the continuum ( column 3 ) , and from the feature assuming it originates from the blended lii doublet at 6707.812  ( column 4 ) ( smith , lambert & nissen 1993 ) , or from ceii ( column 5 ) . column 6 shows the phase of the mira , where phase 0.0 corresponds to maximum brightness in the @xmath19 band according to the ephemeris from munari & jurdana - epi ( 2002 ) .",
    "the radial velocities will , of course , vary according to the pulsation phase .    .[vels ] radial velocities for v407cyg [ cols=\"^,>,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the table shows a constant difference of @xmath20 between the radial velocity of the mira and of the line , if the line is produced by the blended @xmath21 doublet ( assuming a negligible contribution from @xmath22 ) . if , however , the line is identified with ceii the difference in radial velocity with the mira is @xmath23 .",
    "this indicates that the lii identification is to be preferred over ceii .",
    "the absence of any strong s - process lines in the spectrum ( see below ) also supports this conclusion .",
    "the equivalent width of lii 6708  is about 0.34 , relative to the line - blanketed local continuum .",
    "this is in the spectrum obtained on 30 july 1997 , when the hot component was in an inactive state and the equivalent width of the h@xmath24 emission line was only @xmath25 .",
    "the intensities of the absorption bands tio 5448and 7125  suggest a spectral type of m6-m7 .",
    "therefore , it is clear that , at least in this spectral region , the v407cyg radiation was dominated by the cool component . on other dates",
    "the hot component was in an active state which is reflected in a reduced equivalent width for the lithium line .",
    "although , an intrinsic variability of the lithium line in the mira atmosphere , depending , for instance , on the pulsation phase , can not be excluded .",
    "a rough estimate of the abundance of lithium may be obtained from the ratio of the equivalent widths of lii 6708  to cai 6573  ( see catchpole ( 1982 ) for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the equivalent width of the calcium line in the spectrum of v407cyg is @xmath26 .",
    "the equivalent width of the lithium line in v407cyg , 0.34 , is approximately the same as @xcite observed for the s stars : rcmi , sumon , rcyg and hr8714 .",
    "although the ratio of the equivalent width of lii 6708  to cai 6573  in v407cyg is about two which is slightly higher than in these late giants - possibly indicating a higher lithium abundance in v407cyg . a similar equivalent width for the lithium line is also found , for instance , in the s star hv5584 in the lmc .",
    "its effective temperature is @xmath27k , i.e. approximately that expected for an m6 giant .",
    "@xcite estimated the lithium abundance for hv5584 as @xmath28 .",
    "v407cyg is not an s star : the absorption bands of the zro molecule at 6474  and 5751  are not visible in our spectra .",
    "these bands arise from the ground state of the zro molecule and are used to classify s type stars in low - resolution spectra @xcite . in this context",
    "it should be noted that the nearby tio band 6479  is relatively strong and is clearly visible in the low - resolution spectra of v407cyg .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the tio absorption band is observed while zro is not , because at low - resolution it can be difficult to be certain which molecule is present .    in high - resolution spectra of the symbiotic star chcyg , which contains an m7 giant , @xcite found weak zro bands at 5718 , 6412 , but not at 5551 , 6474 . in the spectrum of v407cyg at 5718  and 6412  weak absorption features",
    "are also present ( figure2 ) .",
    "following @xcite we can identify these as zro bands . in the spectrum of chcyg absorptions due to ionized rare - earth elements baii and laii",
    "are seen , in particular , the lines baii 4334  and laii 4827 .",
    "these absorption lines are also visible in the spectrum of v407cyg",
    ".    thus v407cyg does show some weak enhancements of s - process elements which probably indicates that dredge - up has started .",
    "there also seems to be a close similarity between the spectra of the cool components in the symbiotic binaries v407cyg and chcyg , which have similar spectral types , although the giant in ch cyg is not a mira .",
    "there is , however , no lithium line in the spectrum of chcyg .",
    "a strong lithium lii 6708  line has been identified for the first time in a symbiotic mira .",
    "it is only the second identification of lithium in a galactic mira with a period of over 700 days , @xcite having already found lithium in an unnamed variable of comparable period .",
    "there are three possible origins for the lithium which are discussed briefly below .",
    "first it could have been produced by the hot star when it was on the agb , and deposited onto its companion during the mass - loss process which left it as a white dwarf .",
    "this would require the hot component to have undergone its agb to white dwarf transition within about @xmath29 years of the present epoch ; this being the time scale on which the lithium would be destroyed as convection takes surface material close to the high temperature core .",
    "this seems much less probable than the alternative explanations explored below .",
    "secondly , the lithium might have been produced more recently , as a product of the binary interaction , and deposited onto the surface of the agb star .",
    "arnould & nrgaard ( 1975 ) and starrfield et al . (",
    "1978 ) predict the formation of large quantities of lithium during hydrogen - burning thermonuclear runaways , and hernanz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have predicted significant lithium production from some nova models , although it is not at all clear that these calculations will be applicable to symbiotic systems such as v407cyg . as mentioned in section 1.1 lithium",
    "is detected in binary systems where its presence is not understood .",
    "thirdly , we suggest that v407cyg is actually an intermediate mass star , and that the lithium originates from hot bottom burning , as it does in the long period s - type miras in the magellanic clouds . although we can not rule out other mechanisms until our understanding of the production of lithium in galactic low mass agb stars and in interacting binaries is on a much firmer footing .",
    "we also note that , if our explanation is correct , the surface enrichment of lithium apparently precedes the dredge of s - process elements in v407cyg as it does for the agb variables discussed by @xcite .",
    "this discovery that a significant fraction of long period iras miras are lithium rich @xcite , together with finding lithium in an example of the rare class of symbiotic miras , suggests that surveys for lithium should be extended to more long period variables , both in the galaxy and in the magellanic clouds .",
