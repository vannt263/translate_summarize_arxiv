    "the volumic fraction of water is @xmath92 .",
    "the experiment have been automatised and we proceed as follows for this experiment : starting from rest we record the torque during @xmath94s and then increase the speed by @xmath93hz , record one minute and so forth until @xmath95hz , which is reached after @xmath99 minutes .",
    "we then decrease the speed until @xmath96 , by steps of @xmath93hz .",
    "the torque for the water and oil system ( @xmath46 ) is at low speed very close to the single - phase case ( plotted in the same figure for pure oil ( @xmath100 ) ) .",
    "this is consistent with a sum of two layers weakly interacting ( small viscosity difference ) , which basically give the same dimensionnal torque as discussed in figure  [ fig : pure ] . increasing the speed",

    "we plot also this experiment in figure  [ fig : dispersion]a as a parametric points cloud with time as parameter .",
    "one can notice that the torque at the beginning is the one for oil , and gradually reaches the upper branch .",
    "the complementary experiment ( figure  [ fig : dispersion]c ) consists of lowering the speed to @xmath108hz after @xmath99 minutes .",
    "it shows a slow decrease and the final state is not on the lower branch ( figure  [ fig : dispersion]a ) : the two - layers system is not the one stable above @xmath108hz .",
    "the time scales involved in the dispersion and separation processes are thus very long , the latter being even longer ( figure  [ fig : dispersion]b - c ) .",
    "complicated behaviours including periodic oscillations ( with a period of @xmath109min ) have been observed in between and requires further investigation .",

    "we plot in figure  [ fig : zob ] a first result obtained for @xmath60 water in oil .",

    "it seems then possible to collapse the points onto a single curve when one uses this effective viscosity to compute the reynolds number and to normalise the torque in the dispersed state ( figure  [ fig : zob]b ) . notice that in fact we do not have enough points at low values of reynolds numbers for newtonian fluids to really compare this rescaling with consistent data .    in order to understand the interaction between the different scales , we are now working on edge detection algorithm to study the drop size distribution with the lif images",
