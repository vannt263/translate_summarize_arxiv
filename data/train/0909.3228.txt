    "pioneering experiments on ultracold gases of atoms trapped in optical lattices allowed for a direct observation of quantum many - body phenomena , such as the quantum phase transition from mott phase to superfluid phase.@xcite optical lattices are realized by counterpropagating laser beams , which form a periodic potential.@xcite the bosonic particles located on the optical lattice gain kinetic energy when tunneling through the potential wells of neighboring sites of the periodic potential and they exhibit a repulsive interaction when a lattice site is occupied by more than one atom .",
    "a condensate of ultracold atoms can be driven from superfluid phase to mott phase by gradually increasing the intensity of the laser beams .",
    "the potential wells of the optical lattice are shallow for low laser - beam intensity .",
    "thus the bosonic particles can overcome the barrier easily and are delocalized on the whole lattice .",
    "however , for large intensity of the laser beams the potential wells are deep and there is little probability for the atoms to tunnel from one lattice site to another .",
    "this physical behavior can be described by the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model @xcite provided the gas of ultracold atoms is cooled such that only the lowest bloch band of the periodic potential has to be taken into account.@xcite the ground state of the bh model is superfluid when the local on - site repulsion between the atoms is small in comparison to the nearest - neighbor hopping strength whereas it is a mott state for integer particle density and large on - site repulsion compared to the hopping strength . due to these characteristics of the bh model",
    "the depth of the potential wells in optical lattices can be associated directly with the ratio of the on - site repulsion and the hopping strength .",
    "ultracold atoms confined in optical lattices provide a very clean experimental realization of a strongly correlated many - body problem and the internal physical processes are well understood in comparison to conventional condensed - matter systems .",
    "there is large experimental control over the system parameters , such as the particle number , lattice size , and depth of the potential wells .",
    "furthermore the sites of the optical lattice can be addressed individually due to the mesoscopic scale of the lattice.@xcite    the quantum phase transition from mott phase to superfluid phase has been first observed experimentally for ultracold rubidium atoms trapped in a three - dimensional optical lattice @xcite and subsequently as well in optical lattices of two dimensions.@xcite the corresponding theoretical model , the two - dimensional ( 2d ) bh model , has already been investigated to some detail in literature . the phase diagram , which describes the quantum phase transition from mott phase to superfluid phase , has been investigated thoroughly at the mean - field level ( possibly including gaussian - fluctuation corrections).@xcite more accurate results for the phase diagram from quantum monte carlo @xcite ( qmc ) simulations , variational approaches,@xcite and strong - coupling perturbation theory@xcite are also available .",
    "the phase diagram for arbitrary integer fillings has been obtained recently using the so - called diagrammatic process chain approach.@xcite spectral functions of the two - dimensional bh model have been evaluated within a strong - coupling approach @xcite and a variational mean field approach.@xcite    in the present paper we evaluate the border of the quantum phase transition from mott phase to superfluid phase for the first two mott lobes by means of the variational cluster approach ( vca),@xcite and show that this method provides quite accurately the boundaries of the mott phase , as compared with more demanding qmc simulations and perturbative expansions .",
    "in addition , we study in detail the spectral functions of the two - dimensional bh model in both the first and the second mott lobe , which require computing the green s function in real frequency domain . we also present the densities of states and momentum distributions corresponding to the spectral functions . finally ,",
    "as a technical point , we present an extension of the so - called @xmath0-matrix formalism , which has been originally proposed for fermionic ( anticommutator ) green s functions,@xcite to bosonic ( commutator ) green s functions.@xcite as we show below , this extension is nontrivial due to the nonunitary nature of the bogoliubov transformation for bosonic particles .",

    "however , at least for fermion systems , this procedure yields spurious metallic bands in the mott phase for arbitrarily large @xmath3 . since we do not observe any spurious gaps in the spectral function of the 2d bh model we use the periodization on the green s function defined in eq.([eq : num : cpteqfourierfull ] ) .    with the wave - vector",

    "a peculiarity of bosonic systems is that the hole band of the spectral function has negative spectral weight whereas the particle band has positive spectral weight .",

    "the density of states is not a probability distribution , as it contains negative values .",
    "taking the absolute value would yield an all positive density of states , however , it would not be normed and is thus no probability distribution either . for small hopping , the gap in the spectral function is large and the bands are rather flat , i.e. , the width of the bands is small , see fig.[fig : spectrallobe1 ] .",
    "the corresponding density of states contains two well - separated peaks . for increasing hopping , the gap of the spectral function is decreasing and the width of the bands is increasing .",
    "pursuant to the spectral function , the peaks in the density of states become broader for increasing hopping .",
    "the intensity of the two bands is almost constant for small hopping independent of the wave vector @xmath42 , whereas for large hopping a large intensity can be observed at @xmath125 .",
    "the boundaries of the mott lobes correspond to the chemical potential of the state with one additional particle ( hole ) , which is obtained directly from the single - particle ( single - hole ) minimum excitation energy .",

    "particularly , the intensity distribution of the bands seem to be strongly related . yet",
    "the peaks of the density of states are larger due to the twice as large particle density within the second mott lobe and thus the absolute value of the spectral weight in the second mott lobe is larger than the one in the first mott lobe .",
    "the momentum distribution @xmath130 corresponding to the spectral functions in the first and second mott lobe are shown in fig.[fig : nofk ] .     in ( a ) the first mott lobe and ( b ) the second mott lobe .",

    "yet it should be emphasized that the computational effort is considerably lower for vca than for qmc .",
    "furthermore , we evaluated spectral functions in the first and second mott lobe . an important aspect of vca is that the green s function of the system is obtained directly in the real frequency domain , which allows for a direct calculation of the spectral function .",
    "on the other hand , qmc quite generally provides correlation functions in imaginary time .",
    "imaginary - time correlation functions have to be analytically continued to real frequencies , which is a very ill - conditioned problem , as the data contain statistical errors . in qmc",
    "this analytical continuation is best carried out by means of the maximum entropy method .",
    "a very accurate dispersion ( without spectral weight ) has been also obtained by a strong - coupling expansion.@xcite the intensity distribution of the spectral weight is similar for the spectral functions of both mott lobes , leading to an evenly distributed spectral weight for small hopping strengths and to a distribution sharply peaked at @xmath131 for large hopping strengths .",

    "we also evaluated the densities of states and momentum distributions corresponding to the calculated spectral functions .",
    "we compared our vca results for the momentum distribution with strong - coupling perturbation - theory results , where a scaling ansatz has been used , and found excellent quantitative agreement .",
