    "it is a well known fact that the ratio of the number of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) to stellar mass is @xmath4 two orders of magnitude higher in globular clusters ( gcs ) than in the galactic disc @xcite . with the advent of _ chandra _ and",
    "_ xmm - newton _ , studies of x - ray point sources in external galaxies have become possible , and have shown that also there globular clusters are especially abundant in lmxbs .",
    "this is attributed to dynamical processes , through which lmxbs are formed in two - body encounters . due to the @xmath2 dependence on the stellar density",
    "such encounters are frequent in globular clusters and are negligible in the field .",
    "currently , there are 13 lmxbs @xcite in the 150 globular clusters @xcite known in the galaxy .    in the central parts of massive galaxies",
    ", the stellar densities can reach values similar to the densities in less luminous gcs . except for the very inner parts ,",
    "these densities are still an order of magnitude smaller than the densities found in the most luminous gcs , where the lmxbs are preferentially found .",
    "however , the large volume compensates for the smaller density and lmxbs can be formed near the galactic centres in two - body encounters in non - negligible numbers .",
    "whereas dynamical interactions in globular clusters have been intensively investigated , the parameter range typical of galactic centres remains unexplored .",
    "due to an order of magnitude higher stellar velocities , the character of the dynamical interactions and relative importance of different formation channels in the galactic centres differ from those in globular clusters .    due to the large stellar mass contained in the central region of a galaxy ,",
    "a number of `` primordial '' lmxbs formed through the standard evolutionary path exist there too .",
    "although these can not be easily distinguished from the binaries formed in two - body encounters , an argument of the specific lmxb frequency ( per unit stellar mass ) can be employed , in the manner similar to the one that led to the discovery of dynamical formation of binaries in globular clusters .",
    "the volume density of the primordial lmxbs follows the distribution of the stellar mass in a galaxy @xcite whereas the spatial distribution of the dynamically formed binaries is expected to obey the @xmath5 law @xcite .",
    "hence the latter should be expected to be much more concentrated towards the centre of the host galaxy and reveal themselves as a population of `` surplus '' sources near its centre .",
    "m31 is the closest galaxy with a bulge density large enough to host a number of lmxbs formed through dynamical interactions . at a distance of 780",
    "kpc @xcite x - ray sources can be easily resolved with _",
    "chandra _ , even near the centre of the galaxy .",
    "it has been studied extensively with _",
    "chandra _ and we use these observations to explore the radial distribution of bright x - ray point sources in the bulge .",
    "the results of this study are presented in the section [ sect : data ] where it is demonstrated that the specific frequency of x - rays sources increases sharply inside @xmath6 arcmin .",
    "the possible nature of surplus sources is discussed in section [ sect : origin ] .",
    "the details of dynamical formation of binaries in dense stellar environments and dependence on the stellar velocity dispersion are considered in the section [ sect : intro ] .",
    "the results of this section are applied to the inner bulge of m31 and to the galactic globular clusters in sections [ sect : realistic ] .",
    "our conclusions are presented in the section [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "with the currently available _ chandra _ data it is possible to study the spatial distribution of the x - ray point sources in the bulge , without being affected by incompleteness , down to the limiting lumionosity of 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "we restrict our analysis out to a distance of 12 arcmin from the centre and combine 26 acis observations with telescope pointings within the central 10 arcmin region of the m31 bulge for a total exposure time of 201 ks .",
    "details of the data analysis , the source lists and the luminosity functions of various sub - populations in the bulge are presented in @xcite .",
    "we model the radial distribution of the x - ray sources by a superposition of primordial lmxbs and cxb sources , as in @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of the former is assumed to follow the stellar mass distribution of the galaxy , as traced by the k - band light @xcite .",
    "we used the k - band image of m31 provided by 2mass lga @xcite .",
    "the distribution of cxb sources is assumed to be flat on the angular scales of interest . before proceeding with the fit we removed the contribution the from sources other than primordial lmxbs and background galaxies .",
    "firstly , we removed 4 identified foreground sources , 1 supernova remnant and one extended source . secondly , we excluded x - ray binaries associated with globular clusters , as their origin and spatial distribution are different from the `` field '' lmxbs .    among our x - ray sources 13",
    "are coincident with confirmed gcs from @xcite and 8 with gc candidates .",
    "we estimated the number of random matches by displacing the sources by 10 arcsec in 4 directions .",
    "we found an average of 0.25 coincidences with confirmed gcs and 1.0 with gc candidates .",
    "it is well known that the inner parts of m31 are depleted of gcs .",
    "@xcite estimate that 70 per cent of the gcs within 5 arcmin from the centre of m31 have been detected , leaving @xmath416 gcs undetected . as only a fraction , @xmath8 , of the gcs in m31",
    "contain lmxbs the expected contribution of lmxbs from undetected gcs is @xmath43 . due to selection effects , the majority of the undetected gcs are of low luminosity ( absolute visual magnitudes @xmath9 ) , and as lmxbs are preferentially found in high luminosity gcs the actual number of lmxbs in undetected gcs is expected to be @xmath10",
    ". a large fraction of the gc candidates are not real globular clusters .",
    "however , an association with an x - ray source raises the probability of the gc candidates actually being gcs considerably .",
    "we therefore remove these sources from our source list too , noting that all conclusions of this paper remain unchanged if the analysis is performed with a source list in which these sources are included .",
    "we fit the relative normalizations of the lmxbs and cxbs , using the maximum likelihood ( ml ) test .",
    "the best fit is given by a model , in which the normalization of cxbs is zero , meaning that all the sources are lmxbs . as an alternative",
    ", we performed a @xmath11-fit on the binned data , with @xmath12 sources in each bin , and obtained the same result .",
    "the probability that the data can be a realization of the model is 0.06 using the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test , and @xmath13 for the @xmath11 test .",
    "the ks test is less sensitive to deviations at the end of a distribution , and therefore the result of the @xmath11-test is more restrictive .",
    "we conclude that the lmxb+cxb model is rejected .    the visual examination of the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ) suggests that the reason for the rejection of the model is an overdensity of sources in the inner 1 arcmin region of m31 .",
    "motivated by this we did a @xmath11 fit of the same model to the distribution outside 1 arcmin .",
    "the best fit value of the normalization of the cxb component gives the total number of 26@xmath149 sources cxb sources in the entire @xmath15 arcmin .",
    "this value is consistent with the expectation of 29 background galaxies , estimated from the soft band of @xcite , using the method described in @xcite .",
    "we therefore fix the normalization of the cxb component at the value corresponding to 29 sources .",
    "this gives a total number of the lmxbs of 64@xmath147 in the entire @xmath15 arcmin image .",
    "the @xmath11-value is 2.63 for 3 degrees of freedom .",
    "the best fit model is shown in fig . [ fig : fit ] together with the observed distribution .    using the best - fit model",
    "it is possible to investigate the distribution of sources in the inner 1 arcmin and quantify the excess in the surface density of the sources .",
    "the total number of sources detected in the the @xmath16 arcsec region is 29 .",
    "the extrapolation of the best fit model into this region predicts 8.4@xmath17 sources , and therefore the number of surplus sources is 20.6@xmath18 .",
    "the error in the latter estimate accounts for the poissonian uncertainty in the total number of sources inside 60 arcsec and for the uncertainty of the best fit model normalization . as it is obvious from fig.[fig",
    ": fit ] , the contrast between the observed number of sources and that predicted from the k - band light distribution increases towards the centre of the galaxy . inside @xmath19 arcsec , for example , 9 sources are detected with only 1.1 sources predicted .",
    "the formal probability of such an excess to happen due to statistical fluctuation is @xmath20 , assuming poissonian distribution .",
    "non - uniform extinction , peaking at the centre of m31 , could cause the distribution of the _ k_-band light to deviate from the distribution of stellar mass .",
    "this possibility can be excluded , however , as the extinction towards the centre of m31 is low , @xmath21=0.24 mag and @xmath22=0.14 mag @xcite , which extrapolated to the",
    "_ k_-band gives @xmath23=0.03 @xcite .",
    "moreover , a non - uniform extinction distribution would also cause non - uniformity in the apparent colours of the stellar population , which is not observed @xcite .    the surplus sources can be high - mass x - ray binaries associated with star formation in the inner bulge of m31 .",
    "we derive upper limits for the star formation rate and the number of hmxbs from the h@xmath24 and fir luminosities reported by @xcite .",
    "the combined h@xmath24 luminosity of the nuclear region and from diffuse emission inside the star forming ring ( which lies at a radius @xmath450 arcmin , i.e. much larger than the region analysed in this paper ) is 4.3@xmath25 10@xmath26 erg s@xmath1 ( transformed to the distance of 780 kpc used in this paper ) .",
    "from @xcite we find that this corresponds to 3.2 hmxbs with a luminosity above 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the fir luminosity in this region is 5.25@xmath2510@xmath27 l@xmath28 , which corresponds to 5.9 hmxbs with a luminosity above 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "it should be stressed out , that the region these luminosities refer to is almost 20 times larger than the region analysed in this paper .",
    "moreover it is very likely that the main part of the h@xmath24 and fir emission is not associated with star formation , as the number of o - type stars is a factor of @xmath4 200 lower than what would be expected otherwise @xcite . to conclude",
    ", the hmxb nature of the sources in the inner bulge can be excluded .",
    "the surplus sources could have been created in globular clusters that remain undetected . in the catalogue of @xcite",
    "there are 64 confirmed gcs hosting 13 lmxbs in the region we analysed .",
    "the fraction of gcs containing x - ray sources is therefore 0.2 .",
    "this number is larger than what is found in other galaxies @xcite , due to the better sensitivity of our study , but consistent with the results for the inner parts of galaxies in @xcite . attributing the @xmath29 surplus sources to undetected gcs",
    "would therefore indicate that @xmath4 100 unobserved gcs exist in the inner 1 arcmin region of m31 .",
    "this is much larger than allowed by the completeness level of the present studies of gc population in m31 , consistent with only a few undetected globular clusters in this region @xcite .    .",
    "the histograms show distributions of the confirmed globular clusters ( thick grey line ) and globular cluster candidates ( thin grey line ) . ]    in a related scenario , the surplus sources could have been created in globular clusters at larger distances from the centre of m31 . due to the mass segregation the globular clusters drift towards the centre of the bulge , where they are destroyed , leaving behind remnant lmxbs .",
    "this scenario has been motivated by fig.[fig : surplus2 ] where the radial distribution of surplus sources is compared with that of the globular clusters . indeed , for a gc of mass @xmath30",
    "the mass segregation timescale is @xmath31 yr at a radius of 5 arcmin and @xmath32 yr at a radius of 12 arcmin @xcite . assuming that a neutron star turns accreted matter into radiation with an efficiency of @xmath4 0.2 , the lifetime of an lmxb is @xmath33 yr , where @xmath34 is the mass of the donor star at the onset of mass transfer expressed in solar masses , and @xmath35 is the average luminosity of an lmxb in units of @xmath36 erg s@xmath1 . taking into account that on average @xmath37 of gcs in m31 contain lmxbs , a destruction rate of @xmath4 100 globular clusters per gyr is required to explain @xmath29 sources observed near the centre of m31",
    "this number is comparable to the total number of gcs within the entire region analysed in this study , and is @xmath4 30 per cent of the total number of gcs in m31 .",
    "as gcs are not continually formed in large numbers in m31 , the globular cluster system of this galaxy will not be able to sustain such a destruction rate and , consequently , the population of x - ray sources observed in the inner bulge , for any significant length of time .    finally , the stellar density in the central part of the m31 bulge , @xmath38 m@xmath28/pc@xmath39 , is high enough that lmxbs can be formed through dynamical interactions in the same manner as in globular clusters . in the following sections we investigate this possibility , and apply it to the population of x - ray sources in the inner bulge of m31 and in globular clusters in the milky way .",
    "there are three main channels of dynamical lmxb formation operating in dense stellar environments . ] :    1 .   in a tidal capture of a neutron star ( ns ) by a non - degenerate single star ,",
    "a close passage of the two stars induces oscillations in the non - degenerate star , and the energy for this is taken from the orbital energy .",
    "if the energy of the oscillations exceeds the originally positive orbital energy , the stars are captured in a bound orbit @xcite .",
    "2 .   a collision between an ns and an evolved single star on the subgiant or red giant branch ( rgb ) or the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) can lead to the formation of an x - ray binary , in which the donor star is a white / brown dwarf or a helium star , depending on the evolutionary stage of the evolved star before the collision @xcite . in the case of a white dwarf donor an ultra compact x - ray binary",
    "is formed . in this scenario ,",
    "orbital energy is transferred to the envelope of the evolved star , which is expelled , leaving the ns and the core of the evolved star in a bound orbit @xcite .",
    "3 .   in an exchange reaction ,",
    "an ns exchanges place with a star in a pre - existing binary during a close binary - single encounter @xcite .    in the context of lmxb formation in globular clusters in the milky way",
    ", the attention has been initially drawn to the tidal captures @xcite , while the potential importance of the two other mechanisms has been realized few years later @xcite .",
    "the estimates of the lmxb production rates , which followed , revealed that each of the channels could give significant contribution to the population of lmxbs found in the galactic gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since then large amount of work has been done to understand physics of stellar encounters in detail , explore their parameter space and derive accurate mathematical prescriptions for the crossections and rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , there have been surprisingly few studies making specific predictions of numbers of dynamically formed binaries which could be directly compared with their observed population in galactic gcs . with the exception of a few studies considering a handful of individual gcs @xcite ,",
    "the rates are usualy computed for a set of the representative values of parameters ( such as stellar density , velocity dispersion etc . ) and then extrapolated to the entire galactic globular cluster system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an often used assumption is also that the number of lmxbs is proportional to @xmath40 @xcite . although acceptable as an initial approximation , it is too crude to perform a quantitative comparison of the theory with observations .",
    "another major limitation of the most of these investigations is that the subsequent evolution of the newly formed binary , into and through the x - ray active phase , is ignored . due to lack of the attention and effort in this direction , it is currently unclear if any of the channels strongly dominates over the others in real globular clusters .",
    "even less understood is the operation of these processes in the environment of the galactic centers .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to fill these gaps . in particular",
    ", a special attention will be paid to the following aspects of the problem , which have often been ignored in the previous publications on this subject :    1 .",
    "calculation of the encounter crossections and rates in the high velocity regime typical for the galactic centers and investigations of their velocity dependence 2 .",
    "critical review and comparison of the stellar environments ( present day mass function , metallicity , abundance of compact objects etc ) in globular clusters and galactic centers and investigations of their impact on the overall lmxb production rates via different lmxb formation channels .",
    "reasonably accurate calculation of the encounter rates in the galactic globular clusters and inner bulge of m31 , based on their structural properties .",
    "account for evolution of the newly formed binary before and during the x - ray active phase and estimates of the expected numbers of lmxbs based on the derived encounter rates      in the following we compute cross - sections and rates of the three formation channels , consider their dependence on the velocity dispersion of the stars and discuss various factors affecting their efficiency in the high velocity regime .",
    "each of the processes depends on the rate of encounters between two types of objects , which in a unit volume is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the number densities and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the masses of object type 1 and 2 , respectively , @xmath47 is the cross - section of the encounter , and @xmath48 is the distribution of relative velocities at infinity .",
    "assuming that the velocity distributions of the two kinds of objects are both maxwellian and have the same three - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath49 , the distribution of relative velocities is given by @xmath50 due to the effect of gravitational focusing , the cross - section for two objects to pass within a distance @xmath51 of each other is given by @xmath52 in most cases , the gravitational focusing ( the second term in the brackets ) dominates . only for very fast encounters ( large @xmath51 and/or @xmath53 )",
    "is @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath51 is independent on the relative velocity , @xmath55 for slow encounters , and @xmath56 for the fast ones .",
    "capture of a neutron star in a bound orbit with a companion will lead to formation of an x - ray binary provided that the companion star will fill its roche lobe and mass transfer will commense within a reasonable time , shorter than @xmath57 gyr . if the initial binary separation is too large for this to occur immediately after the capture , it can be decreased in the course of evolution of the binary .",
    "there are 3 main mechanisms , which affect the orbital separation : ( i ) magnetic braking , ( ii ) gravitational braking and ( iii ) binary - single interactions .",
    "the former two are familiar from the standard theory of the binary evolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "for the companion mass in the @xmath58 range they will bring the system in to the roche lobe contact within 5 gyr if the initial orbital separation does not exceed @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "the braking mechanism due to interaction of the binary with single `` field '' stars is specific for high stellar density environments .",
    "its properties are briefly summarized below .    when considering evolution of a binary due to binary - single interactions it is conventional to divide the binaries into soft and hard , depending on the ratio of their binding energy to the kinetic energy of the single star at infinity @xcite .",
    "soft binaries have relatively wide orbits , and interactions with single stars tend to widen the orbit further or to ionize the binary .",
    "hard binaries , on the contrary , are on average hardened by encounters with single stars @xcite .",
    "the effect of this is that over time most binaries with a separation above a critical value are disrupted , while the compact ones become more compact .",
    "the boundary between soft and hard binaries depends on the stellar velocity dispersion and the mass ratios and ranges from @xmath61 in a typical globular cluster to @xmath62 few @xmath63 in the high velocity environment of the m31 bulge . due to a linear dependence of the crossection on the binary separation",
    "the collisional braking is mostly important at wide binaries , where magnetic braking and gravitational radiation , decreasing as inverse power of the binary separation , are inefficient .",
    "the initial orbital separation in the binaries produced through tidal captures and collisions with rgb / agb stars is small and a large fraction of this systems will start mass transfer ( i.e. become x - ray sources ) soon after their formation .",
    "only a small fraction of them ( @xmath6420 per cent in gcs and @xmath65 per cent in m31 ) will experience close encounters with single stars significantly affecting thery semimajor axis , therefore binary - single interactions are not an important factor in their evolution .",
    "binaries created through exchanges , on the contrary , typically have wider orbits , and the effects of encounters can be important .",
    "if the initial binary separation is large and the braking mechanisms are insufficient to start roche - lobe overflow , this can occur when the donor star evolves off the main sequence , as a result of its expansion during the giant phase . in these systems",
    "the accretion disc is large and x - ray emission from vicinity of the ns is insufficient for the irradiation to keep the entire disc ionized , and they are therefore transient @xcite .",
    "furthermore , mass transfer can only occur while the donor is on the rgb , which makes the lifetime of such systems short . while they may account for bright sources detected in massive elliptical galaxies @xcite , they are too rare to make a significant contribution to our sample .",
    "the nss in these systems are spun up to become millisecond pulsars , and in the galactic gcs a large number of these have been observed @xcite . after the outer layers of the giant star have been ejected , a binary consisting of a white dwarf and",
    "an ns remains .",
    "however for the vast majority of the systems the binary separation is too large for mass transfer to begin , and they will therefore not become observable in x - rays .",
    "the formation rates of lmxbs due to tidal captures and stellar collisions can be found by integrating the encounter rate , given by equation [ eq : rate1 ] , over the relevant parts of the mass function of stars @xmath66 .",
    "we assume that the latter follows the form of @xcite , a broken powerlaw with slope 1.3 from 0.1 - 0.5@xmath67 and slope 2.3 above 0.5 @xmath67 , and is normalized according to @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the maximum initial mass of stars that have not yet evolved to become stellar remnants at present , and @xmath70 is the lower cut - off mass .",
    "the number density of stars is then given by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the stellar mass density .",
    "we assume the mass of all neutron stars to be @xmath73 , and that they are formed from stars with initial mass in the range @xmath74 .",
    "the number density of these can then be expressed as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 ( for @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xmath79 ) .",
    "we define the rate integrated with the mass function @xmath80 where integration is performed in the relevant initial mass range ( see below ) and @xmath81 is from equation [ eq : rate1 ] . with this definition @xmath82",
    "gives the rate of encounters in s@xmath1 @xmath83 .",
    "for the calculation of @xmath84 it is necessary to know the current radius of a star @xmath85 as a function of its initial mass , as well as its evolutionary stage , which is used to define the mass limits of the integral .",
    "these informations we take from stellar isochrones of @xcite .",
    "we define an encounter between two stars as a collision if the stars come so close that considerable amounts of material is exchanged between them , and hydrodynamical effects become important . for the collisions with nss , that are relevant for dynamical formation of lmxbs",
    ", we distinguish between collisions with main sequence ( ms ) or horizontal branch ( hb ) stars and with evolved stars on the rgb or agb . due to the different structure of the stars ,",
    "the outcome of a collision with a ns is different .",
    "simulations indicate that collisions between an ns and an ms star tend to destroy the ms star @xcite .",
    "we expect the same to happen to stars on the hb , as their structure is similar to that of ms stars @xcite .",
    "collisions of this type are not interesting from the point of view of formation of x - ray binaries .",
    "as the envelope of stars on the rgb or agb is less strongly bound to the core , a collision with an ns can lead to the envelope being expelled .",
    "the outcome is a short period binary consisting of the core of the evolved star and the ns .",
    "if the evolved star had a degenerate core , an ultra - compact x - ray binary ( ucxb ) with a white dwarf donor will be formed @xcite . in either case",
    "an x - ray binary can be created .",
    "the maximum value of distance at periastron @xmath86 , for which significant amounts of material can be exchanged in an encounter of an ns with a non - degenerate star ( with radius @xmath87 ) is between @xmath87 and the orbital separation at which the star fills its roche - lobe @xcite : @xmath88\\ ] ] where @xmath89 . for encounters with nss ,",
    "this separation ranges from @xmath90 to @xmath91 for stars with masses in the @xmath92 range .",

    "the value of @xmath95 given , the encounter rate can be calculated from equations [ eq : rate1]-[eq : sigma ] and [ eq : gamma_large ] ( but see below regarding the choice of integration limits in equation [ eq : rate1 ] ) .    when considering collisions between nss and evolved stars , it is important to note that the envelope of a star on the rgb / agb is loosely bound to the core , and the orbital energy of the two stars at infinity can be comparable to the binding energy of the envelope .",
    "it is therefore possible that the envelope is expelled without carrying off enough energy to leave a bound system , or that in the high - velocity encounters , the duration of the interaction is too short for enough energy to be transferred from the ns to the envelope . while simulations indicate that the rg envelope is promptly disrupted , instead of ejected through a common envelope ( ce ) evolution @xcite , the energy considerations are similar . adopting the formalism of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we assume that the envelope of the rg is ejected , and that energy for this ( the binding energy of the envelope @xmath96 ) is taken from the orbital energy of the two stars which is therefore changed by @xmath97 .",
    "allowing energy to be lost , e.g. as radiation or as some of the envelope is ejected with a velocity higher than the escape speed , an efficiency parameter @xmath98 is defined , so that @xmath99 .",
    "the binding energy of the rg is given by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the mass and radius of the rg , respectively , and @xmath103 is the mass of the envelope of the rg .",

    "[ fig : vrel ] we compare the formation rates of ucxbs due to collisions between rgb+agb stars and nss for different values of @xmath116 .",
    "the rates were calculated by integrating over all evolutionary stages of stars on the rgb / agb , using the isochrones of @xcite .",
    "the details of the calculations are given below in section [ sect : comparison ] .",
    "it is obvious that the choice of @xmath116 is very important in the bulge of m31 , with an order of magnitude difference between the rates of the highest and the lowest value , while the difference is relatively small in gcs .",
    "sph simulations indicate that the effectivity in standard ce evolution is @xmath117 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and in population synthesis studies , values of @xmath118 in the range 0.1 - 1.0 are most often assumed @xcite , and this seems to give a good fit to the observed properties of the post - ce binary population .",
    "however there are differences between the standard ce evolution and the collisions considered here . in the former , the stars are already in a bound orbit , and the energy can therefore be transferred to the envelope over a longer period of time during a large number of orbital revolutions . on the other hand , in a collision , enough energy has to be transferred from the ns to the envelope during the first periastron passage , so that the two stars remain bound . especially for high velocity encounters",

    "while the low - velocity regime has been well investigated using sph simulations @xcite , showing that a value of @xmath119 is adequate , no investigation of the high - velocity regime has been performed .",
    "we assume that @xmath116 is in the range 0.11.0 ( 1.0 can be considered a very conservative estimate , giving the minimum rate of lmxb formation through this process , whereas 0.1 may be a rather optimistic value ) , with 0.5 being our chosen standard value for calculations below .      at periastron distances above @xmath86 , and up to a few times @xmath120 , tidal capture can happen .",
    "@xcite provided a way of calculating the energy absorbed by the stars assuming @xmath121 polytropes and @xcite extended these calculations to other polytropic indices . in this formulation ,",
    "the energy of oscillations induced in the non - degenerate star of mass @xmath122 during an encounter with a neutron star is @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the distance of closest approach . only the spherical harmonic indices @xmath125 ( quadrupole ) and @xmath126 ( octupole ) are included , as higher indices give negligible contributions to the energy @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath127 is defined as @xmath128 with the tabulated overlap integrals of @xcite , for polytropic indices @xmath121 and",
    "@xmath129 , we use the numerical method described by @xcite to calculate @xmath130 . from equation ( [ eq : energy ] )",
    "it is then possible to calculate the maximum value of @xmath131 ( we call this @xmath132 ) for which capture will occur , when the mass of the star and the relative velocity at infinity is known .",
    "we use this method for the case where the non - degenerate star is on the ms .",

    "are not important for the tidal capture process , a higher value is used in the latter case ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ] for stars on the red giant branch , we use the results of @xcite , who calculated @xmath132 for captures of a neutron star by a 0.8 @xmath67 star at various evolutionary stages along the rgb .",
    "this mass is close to the ms turn - off masses for the galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) , whereas the turn - off mass in m31 is higher , @xmath41 @xmath67 .",
    "we use their results directly in both cases . as tidal captures by evolved stars give a negligible contribution to the overall binary formation rates we did not attempt to perform a more accurate computation for the case of m31 .",
    "we neglect tidal captures during the subsequent evolutionary stages .",
    "the structure of stars on the agb is similar to those on the rgb , but the time spent there is much shorter .",
    "the tidal capture rate must therefore be lower .",
    "the time spent on the hb is also very short , compared to the ms lifetime , and although the tidal capture rate may be comparable to the rgb rate , it is much smaller than the ms capture rates .",
    "the tidal capture rate @xmath135 is computed as a rate of encounter with the periastron distance @xmath136 , i.e. contribution of very close encounters resulting in collisions is subtracted : @xmath137   v_{rel}dv_{rel } \\label{eq : gamma_tid}\\ ] ] the upper integration limit @xmath138 is defined as the velocity at which @xmath139 i.e. the term in square brackets is required to be positive inside the integration limits .",
    "the @xmath140 is calculated from equation [ eq : sigma ] with @xmath141 .",
    "important for the following evolution of tidal capture binaries is the timescale on which the tidally induced oscillations are dissipated .",
    "if this timescale is short ( as argued by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that a large fraction of the energy is thermalized within one orbital revolution of the binary , new oscillations will be induced at each periastron passage .",
    "the binary quickly becomes circularized with the final orbital separation ( from conservation of angular momentum ) : @xmath142 for slow encounters ( low @xmath53 or small @xmath131 ) , @xmath143 . if the dissipation time scale is too short , the quick conversion of the energy ( of the order of few per cent of the binding energy of the star ) may cause the star to expand and lead to a merger .",
    "the outcome of the dissipation process depends on the thermalization timescale and the region of the star where the energy is deposited , both factors being unkown @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "if the dissipation is inefficient , coupling of the orbital motion with oscillation can cause large fluctuations in the orbital energy , substantially extending the circularization process and potentially scattering a fraction of the binaries to wider orbits @xcite .",
    "the details and the final outcome of this processes are poorly understood . in the following",
    "we assume that all binaries become circularized with the final separation given by equation [ eq : afinal ] .",
    "equation [ eq : gamma_tid ] defines the total tidal capture rate , irrespective of the subsequent evolution of the tidally formed binary . in order to calculate the rate of encounters , leading to formation of an lmxb",
    ", one needs to account for the finite braking time scales . for this",
    ", @xmath132 , used to calculate @xmath140 in equation [ eq : gamma_tid ] , is replaced by min@xmath144 , where @xmath145 depends on the mass of the star and is chosen so that the braking time scale for the tidal capture binary is shorter than 5 gyr . due to small values of the tidal capture radius @xmath132 , this does not affect the final rates significantly .",
    "the rate of exchange reactions between a binary @xmath146 and a star @xmath147 is : @xmath148 where @xmath66 is the distribution of mass of one of the stars in the binary , @xmath149 is the binary mass ratio and @xmath150 its probablity distribution , @xmath151 is the binary semimajor axis distribution and @xmath152 is the exchange rate of a star @xmath147 into a binary @xmath146 computed from the equation [ eq : rate1 ] . in the context of lmxb",
    "formation the third star @xmath147 is an ns or a black hole .",
    "we have studied the spatial distribution of the luminous x - ray point sources ( @xmath153 erg s@xmath1 ) in the bulge of m31 .",
    "we show that there is a significant increase in the specific frequency of sources , per unit stellar mass , in the inner @xmath6 arcmin .",
    "this behaviour is similar , although smaller in the magnitude , to that observed in globular clusters .",
    "the radial distribution of the surplus sources follows the @xmath2 profile .",
    "all these suggest that the surplus sources are dynamically created in stellar encounters in the high stellar density environment of the inner bulge of m31 .",
    "this is further confirmed by the peculiarity of their luminosity distribution , which resembles that of the globular cluster sources in m31 and our galaxy @xcite .",
    "it has long been known that dynamical interactions are responsible for the relatively large number of x - ray sources observed in globular clusters , but this is the first evidence of the dynamical formation of lmxbs in the vicinity of a galactic center .",
    "the stellar velocities in bulges are higher than in globular clusters by a factor of @xmath57 .",
    "we therefore performed a detailed study of the velocity dependence of the three main dynamical processes leading to the formation of lmxbs : tidal captures of a compact objects by main sequence stars , collisions between evolved stars and compact objects and the exchange of a compact object into an already existing binary .",
    "another major factor affecting the overal encounter rates and the numbers of dynamically formed lmxbs is the high efficiency of the mass segregation in globular clusters , which modifies significantly the spatial distributions of objects of different mass and affects the present day mass function in different parts of a globular cluster .",
    "in addition , due to the relative shallowness of the potential well , the populations of compact objects are significantly depleted in globular clusters .",
    "we found that while exchange reactions are potentially the dominant formation channel in globular clusters ( although stellar collisions might decrease the importance of this channel significantly ) , this process is relatively unimportant in m31 . similarly ,",
    "tidal captures of nss by main sequence stars of mass @xmath154 are important in globular clusters , but not in m31 . instead the main formation channel is tidal captures of compact objects by low mass ( @xmath155 ) stars , with some contribution from collisions between red giants and compact objects . while the geometrical collision rate is high enough to explain the total number of sources from the latter channel , the majority of the collisions are unlikely to lead to the formation of a binary system , as the binding energy of the envelopes of most rgb / agb stars is too low to capture a compact object in a high velocity environment .",
    "we conclude that the majority of the sources in m31 are short - period binaries , and in contrast to globular clusters many of them have bh accretors .",
    "we note that the bh binaries with a very low mass companion may become persistent x - ray sources after the donor star is depleted below , @xmath156 , due to small size of the accretion disc and the positive dependence of the gravitational breaking rate on the mass of the primary .",
    "we also predict for m31 a large number of faint transients , similar to the accreting msec pulsars in our galaxy .",
    "overall , we have been able to explain the spatial distribution and absolute numbers of surplus sources detected in the inner bulge of m31 as a well as the statistics of lmxbs in the metal rich globular clusters .",
    "however , we overpredict by a factor of @xmath157 the population of lmxbs in the metal poor clusters .",
