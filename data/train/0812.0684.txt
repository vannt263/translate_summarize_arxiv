    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in optical lattices provide an excellent tool to study solid state systems  @xcite .",
    "one of the methods which are currently established experimentally  @xcite for becs in an optical lattice is tunneling control via time - periodic potential differences  @xcite .",
    "effects investigated theoretically in periodically shaken systems include multi - particle entanglement  @xcite and nonlinear landau - zener processes  @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization  @xcite of destruction of tunneling via time - periodic potential differences  @xcite was the breakthrough for tunneling control via time - periodic potential differences .",
    "the systems used so far in experiments are as divers as becs in an optical lattice  @xcite , single particles in a double well  @xcite and light in a double - well system  @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite suggested to use time - periodic shaking for a tilted double - well potential to measure an analog of photon - assisted tunneling ",
    "the `` photon''-frequencies corresponding to shaking - frequencies in the kilo - hertz regime .",
    "recently , photon - assisted tunneling was observed for a bec in a periodically shaken optical lattice  @xcite . when the bec was allowed to expand for some time",
    ", the width of the condensate was measured to be roughly proportional to the tunneling matrix element for small becs whereas it was proportional to the square of the tunneling matrix element for larger condensates .    while this might be an indication of a transition from ballistic to diffusive transport  @xcite , the verification of such a transition requires the precise measurement of the time - dependence of the width of the wave function in order to distinguish both regimes of transport ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . without such measurements , other explanations for the observed dependence of the width of the bec can not be excluded .    here",
    "we develop an alternative interpretation of the experimental results : using two interacting bosons in a simple tight - binding one - band model we show that the transition from a linear to a quadratic dependence on the tunneling amplitude might be an interaction - induced effect within the ballistic regime .",
    "we demonstrate , both with the help of analytical arguments and numerical simulations , that the wave function of an interacting boson pair indeed behaves qualitatively very similar to the bec in the experiment : on the one hand , weakly interacting particles can reproduce the linear scaling with the tunneling matrix element observed for small condensates . on the other hand ,",
    "more strongly interacting particles reproduce the quadratic scaling for larger condensates ( which have a larger total interaction energy ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mod ] we introduce the one - dimensional bose - hubbard hamiltonian with a constant force and time - periodic driving used to model the experimental situation . in the case of high driving frequencies ,",
    "the time - dependent hamiltonian can be replaced by an effective , time - independent hamiltonian . for this hamiltonian",
    ", exact two - particle energy eigenstates describing bound boson pairs can be derived @xcite as is explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : exa ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bal ] we investigate the dynamical behavior of two - particle wave packets . employing the obtained exact dispersion relation for interacting boson pairs , we derive the dependence of the width of the wave packet after some time of free expansion on the ratio of interaction and tunneling matrix element .",
    "these theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations of the two - particle schrdinger equation for the full driven bose - hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "using the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the one - dimensional bose - hubbard hamiltonian with time - periodic shaking describing the experiment can be written as : @xmath0 where the operators @xmath1 annihilate ( create ) bosons at the lattice site @xmath2 and @xmath3 are number operators ; @xmath4 is the hopping matrix element , @xmath5 is the potential difference of two adjacent wells with lattice spacing @xmath6 , @xmath7 the frequency with which the system is shaken and @xmath8 the amplitude of the shaking .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : htotal ] ) describes a system of interacting bosons in a tilted and driven optical lattice . for an untilted and undriven lattice we have @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "floquet - theory  @xcite can be applied to understand the physics of such a driven system . for not too low driving frequencies ( @xmath11 ) , the resonance condition @xmath12 with integer @xmath13",
    "leads to photon - assisted tunneling ( @xcite ) . in the high - frequency limit ( @xmath11 and @xmath14  @xcite )",
    "many aspects of the physics behind the system can be understood by replacing the time - dependent hamiltonian with constant force by a time - independent hamiltonian without any additional force : @xmath15 where the effective tunneling matrix element is given by @xmath16 with the @xmath13th order bessel function @xmath17 .",
    "thus , in this time - periodic system photon assisted tunneling can lead to an increase of the tunneling amplitude ( as the energy difference between neighboring wells is removed in the effective hamiltonian ) .",
    "moreover , within an @xmath13-photon resonance , tunneling can also be suppressed by tuning the driving amplitude @xmath8 such that the ratio @xmath18 of driving amplitude and @xmath19 corresponds to a zero of the bessel function  @xmath20 .    without interactions ( @xmath21 )",
    ", the effective hamiltonian reduces to a well - known single - particle hamiltonian with extended bloch - waves as eigenfunctions @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the wannier - function at lattice - site @xmath2 , with the corresponding energy eigenvalues @xmath24 within a parameter regime for which the @xmath25-dispersion relation can be replaced by a quadratic dispersion relation , @xmath26 , the single particle in a tight - binding lattice behaves like a free particle .",
    "in fact , such model hamiltonians can be used to do numerics for a free particle by setting @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mass of the free particle with dispersion relation  @xmath29 .    without interaction ,",
    "a bec of @xmath30 bosons would simply be the product of @xmath30 single - particle wave functions .",
    "if one measures the width of a condensate after a certain time of free expansion  @xcite , this thus corresponds to the popular text - book exercise  @xcite of calculating the width @xmath31 for a single free particle .",
    "starting from a gaussian wave packet at time zero , @xmath32 one finds @xmath33 where @xmath34 .    for a non - interacting bec in an optical lattice one can thus expect to find for not too small free expansion times  @xmath35 : @xmath36 where the dashes denote derivatives with respect to the argument ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "this equation was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to measure the effective tunneling matrix element @xmath38 as using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ek ] ) and ( [ eq : deltax ] ) one has : @xmath39 in order to see if this relation always survives interaction , two interacting bosons are investigated in the following sections , starting with the construction of corresponding energy eigenstates .",
    "two - particle effects in optical lattices are interesting both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "recent investigations include superexchange interactions for mixtures of different spins  @xcite",
    ". motivated by the experiment  @xcite , this manuscript concentrates on pairs of indistinguishable particles .",
    "the aim is to find exact analytical expressions for the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : heff ] ) for two bosons and non - zero interaction @xmath40 . rather than using the approach via green s functions of ref .",
    "@xcite , one can proceed along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite to show in a straightforward calculation ( see the appendix for details ) that a large class of two - particle wave functions is given by @xmath41 is required because the bosons are indistinguishable , and @xmath42 corresponds to the fock state with two particles at lattice site @xmath43 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath44 are given by @xmath45 where @xmath46\\;,\\ ] ] @xmath47 and @xmath48 as for the bloch - waves  ( [ eq : bloch ] ) and for plane waves for free particles , these wave functions can not be normalized in the usual sense .",
    "nevertheless , to avoid divergence for @xmath49 , one needs @xmath50 and thus @xmath51 .",
    "the energy eigenvalue of the state @xmath52 can be written as ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ap : en ] ) and ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath53 and one thus obtains @xmath54    the solutions calculated above represent the bound states of a boson pair .",
    "in addition to these solutions one has a continuum of scattering eigenstates @xcite which will play , however , only a minor role in the description of the physical situation considered here : the initial wave function is given by a narrow gaussian centered around a lattice site .",
    "thus , both particles are likely to be sitting at the same lattice site and , therefore , the initial state lies nearly entirely in the subspace of bound states of the two - boson system .",
    "the value that is relevant for the spreading of two - particle wave packets is not the energy @xmath55 of a pair but the energy per particle .",
    "hence , for the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : heff ] ) we have @xmath56 equations ( [ eq : deltax ] ) and ( [ eq : e  ] ) therefore show that the width of the bec in the driven and tilted lattice is given by @xmath57 from which we find the following limiting behavior , @xmath58 where @xmath59 was introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jeff ] ) . the corresponding expression for the width in the undriven and untilted lattice , which we denote by @xmath60 ,",
    "is obtained by replacing @xmath38 by @xmath4 , @xmath61 thus we see that the transition from a linear to a quadratic dependence on the bessel function observed in ref .",
    "@xcite can , within this simple two - particle model , be explained as being a continuous transition based on the dispersion relation ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) for two interacting particles .",
    "it is important to note that one does not have to wait until the dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath35 becomes linear in order to see the scaling when comparing , e.g. , an undriven system without tilt with a periodically shaken , tilted system with @xmath13-photon - assisted tunneling . in the high - frequency limit",
    ", the main difference is that the modulus of @xmath38 will be lower than @xmath4 by a factor of @xmath62 . if one plots the width of an initially localized wave packet ( cf",
    ".  ref .",
    "@xcite ) as a function of @xmath63 , the undriven system will thus spread faster . only by rescaling the time scale for the undriven system one can hope to make both functions agree . for weak interactions , the following equation relates the width of the undriven system at time @xmath64 to that of the driven system at time @xmath65 : @xmath66 for stronger interactions another factor of @xmath62 is necessary : @xmath67    the above reasoning explains why the width of the bec can be proportional to @xmath68 even within the ballistic regime . however , the experimental results of ref .  @xcite show even more , namely that @xmath69 is not only proportional to @xmath70 , but also that the ratio of the width in the tilted and driven lattice to the width in the untilted and undriven lattice is approximately equal to @xmath68 , i.  e. @xmath71 we demonstrate in figs .  [",
    "fig : ana ] and [ fig : ana2 ] that it is indeed possible to find parameters which reproduce the experimentally observed behavior within the framework of the theory presented here . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ana ] we compare the driven interacting system ( @xmath72 ) with the undriven system for noninteracting particles ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we see that for @xmath73 ( dotted curves ) the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : experiment ] ) nearly lies on top of the curves representing the right - hand side of this equation ( dashed curves ) . for lower interactions ( dash - dotted curves ) ,",
    "the scaling is again @xmath74 as in the single - particle case .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ana ] the width of the wave function was compared to the width for non - interacting particles .",
    "however , the observed scaling even occurs ( for larger interactions than those chosen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ana ] ) when comparing the untilted , undriven interacting system with the periodically driven interacting system : figure  [ fig : ana2 ] shows that again a very similar scaling of the width of the condensate is found .",
    "although several papers have shown the validity of the effective hamiltonian approach used so far ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , one should demonstrate that it also is valid for the present situation . to do this",
    ", we numerically solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation corresponding to the full hamiltonian  ( [ eq : htotal ] ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : num ] ) . as the initial wave function",
    "we choose a gaussian function for the center - of - mass wave function ( corresponding to an initial confinement via a harmonic trapping potential ) , @xmath75 where the sum over all possible @xmath37 values ( rather than an integral ) is necessary as numeric calculations can not be done in infinite lattices .",
    "the initial wave function is sitting in the middle of the lattice ( for an odd number @xmath76 of lattice - sites , the sites can be labelled as ) . in the finite , shaken lattice relevant for the numerics in this paper , vanishing boundary conditions are a suitable choice  @xcite .",
    "for the center - of - mass part of the wave function ( cf.eq .",

    "the initial wave function was calculated without any initial momentum ( @xmath80 ) and with @xmath81 . for the undriven system ,",
    "@xmath82 was chosen in the initial wave function , for the driven system with @xmath83 , we chose @xmath84 to mimic an experimental situation where the initial wave function is prepared in a harmonic - oscillator potential and the periodic shaking is switched on before switching off this potential .",
    "the quadratic scaling as predicted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : quadraticscaling ] ) can thus indeed be observed numerically ( fig .",
    "[ fig : num ] ) .",
    "photon - assisted tunneling in a periodically shaken optical lattice was investigated for two interacting bosons .",
    "both numerical and analytical calculations were done for a periodically driven one - band bose - hubbard model .",
    "figures  [ fig : ana]-[fig : num ] demonstrate that the experimentally observed  @xcite dependence of the width of the bec on the square of the tunneling matrix element can be explained  at least qualitatively within the simple two - particle model investigated here  as being an interaction - induced effect which is based on the dispersion relation for bound boson pairs .    while our simplified approach thus explains some aspects of the experiment  @xcite , calculations for larger particle numbers ( which are not straightforward to generalize from the method presented here ) are likely to lead to further insights into the experiment for which additional effects like decoherence by particle losses might also play an important role .",
    "an experimental measurement of the time - dependence of the width of the wave function would be of great interest for the theoretical analysis and the modelling of the transport properties of quantum condensates .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to see if indeed a transition from ballistic to diffusive transport takes place , or if the simple two - particle model presented in this paper can explain the relevant features of the experiment .",
