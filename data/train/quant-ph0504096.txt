    "recent progress in experimental techniques for the coherent control of light - matter interaction opens many opportunities for interesting practical applications .",
    "the experiments are carried out on various types of materials such as cold sodium atoms @xcite , rubidium atom vapors @xcite , solids @xcite , photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "these experiments are based on the control over the absorption properties of the medium and study slow light and superluminal light effects .",
    "the control can be realized in the regime of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , by the coherent population oscillations or other induced transparency techniques .",
    "the use of each different materials brings specific advantages important for the practical realization of the effects .",
    "for instance , the cold atoms have negligible doppler broadening and small collision rates , which increases ground - state coherence time .",
    "the experiments on rubidium vapors are carried at room temperatures and this does not require application of complicated cooling methods .",
    "the solids are obviously one of the strongest candidates for realization of long - living optical memory .",
    "photonic crystals provide a broad range of paths to guide and manipulate the slow light .",
    "the interest in the physics of light propagation in atomic vapors and bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) is strongly motivated by the success of research on storage and retrieval of optical information in these media @xcite .    even though the linear approach to describing these effects based on the theory of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite is developed in detail @xcite , modern experiments require more complete nonlinear descriptions @xcite .",
    "the linear theory of eit assumes the probe field to be much weaker than the controlling field . to allow significant changes in the initial atomic state due to interaction with the optical pulse , here we go beyond the limits of linear theory . in the adiabatic regime ,",
    "when the fields change in time very slowly , approximate analytical solutions @xcite and self - consistent solutions @xcite were found and later applied in the study of processes of storage and retrieval @xcite .",
    "different eit and self - induced transparency solitons of nonlinear regime were classified and numerically studied for their stability @xcite .",
    "as it was demonstrated by dutton and coauthors @xcite strong nonlinearity can result in interesting new phenomena .",
    "recent experiments and numerical studies @xcite have shown that the adiabatic condition can be relaxed allowing for much more efficient control over the storage and retrieval of optical information .    in this paper",
    "we study the interaction of light with a gaseous active medium whose working energy levels are well approximated by the @xmath0-scheme .",
    "our theoretical model is a very close prototype for a gas of sodium atoms , whose interaction with the light is approximated by the structure of levels of the @xmath0-type .",
    "the structure of levels is given in fig .",

    "the excited state @xmath5 corresponds to the hyperfine sub - level of the term @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "we consider the case when the atoms are cooled down to microkelvin temperatures in order to suppress the doppler shift and increase the coherence life - time for the ground levels .",
    "the atomic coherence life - time in sodium atoms at a temperature of @xmath8k is of the order 0.9 ms @xcite .",
    "typically , in the experiments the pulses have length of microseconds , which is much shorter than the coherence life - time and longer than the optical relaxation time of @xmath9 .",
    "the gas cell is illuminated by two circularly polarized optical beams co - propagating in the z - direction .",
    "one beam , denoted as channel @xmath10 , is a @xmath11-polarized field , and the other , denoted as @xmath12 , is a @xmath13-polarized field .",

    "see , for example , references @xcite . in this work",
    "we choose to use an algebraic version of the is method , i.e. the darboux - bcklund ( db ) transformations .",
    "the db method does not require a full investigation of the initial value problem and merely allows mounting of a soliton on a chosen background .",
    "the resulting solution is , of course , consistent with the underlying initial value problem .",
    "we use darboux - bcklund transformations , in the spirit of @xcite , up to certain modifications .    in the physical case considered in this report ,",

    "it is straightforward to show that for the state eq.([init_fields0 ] ) of the atom - field system a general solution of linear system eqs.([lin_system_1]),([lin_system_2 ] ) can be represented in the following form @xmath103 where a @xmath104 matrix @xmath105 is defined through two complex functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 as follows @xmath108 here @xmath109 is a @xmath104 identity matrix .",

    "the module of this coefficient can be set to unity without loss of generality . for shorter notations",

    "therefore , for small intensities the phase @xmath123 is slowly varying in time and describes the slow - light soliton , while the phase @xmath124 is varying with a speed close to the speed of light in the vacuum due to the term @xmath126 .",
    "in this section we introduce a concept of fast and slow - light solitons in the @xmath0-medium and explain how the nonlinear interplay between the solitons leads to a possibility to control transparency of the medium .",
    "we discuss first the mechanism of transparency control for the slow - light soliton .",
    "we explain how the fast soliton propagating in the _ a _ channel hops to the _ b _ channel where the slow - light soliton is propagating .",
    "the fast soliton then destroys the slow - light soliton , thus stopping the propagation of the latter , and then disappears itself due to the strong relaxation in the system .",
    "as was indicated above , in this work we consider exact solutions of the maxwell - bloch system eqs.([maxwell_m]),([liouv ] ) existing on some finite background .",
    "the background field plays the same role as the controlling field in the conventional linear theory of eit , but it enters the exact solutions as a parameter in a substantially nonlinear fashion .",
    "we start with the case of a time independent field specified as follows @xmath127 here @xmath128 is introduced in order to take into account small spatial variations of the phase .",
    "the intensity of the background field @xmath39 is an experimentally adjustable parameter , which provides control over the transparency of optical gates and determines the speed of the slow - light soliton . the maxwell - bloch system eqs.([maxwell_m]),([liouv ] ) is satisfied with the following initial state of atoms @xmath129 the parameter @xmath130 determines the population of the excited state and has to be larger than @xmath131 .",
    "it is important to notice that for a time - independent background field atoms can be prepared in a mixture of dark state and polarized states only for nonvanishing parameter @xmath132 , which allows to access a wider range of physically interesting situations .    for a time - independent background field",
    "we immediately find solutions of eqs.([riccati]),([zequation ] ) , viz .",
    "@xmath133 as we noted in the previous section , when @xmath134 depends on @xmath43 @xmath135 and the structure of the solution @xmath105 in eq.([tmatrix ] ) is slightly modified , i.e. we have to replace @xmath136 with @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the pauli matrix .",
    "hence , the phases eqs.([phase2 ] ) , ( [ phase3 ] ) read @xmath139    using the general solution eqs.([omega_a_gen]),([omega_b_gen ] ) we can find the dynamics describing the formation of the transparency gate for initial conditions specified in eqs.([init_fields1]),([atoms_init1 ] ) . for simplicity ,",
    "in this section we take the spectral parameter to be purely imaginary , @xmath140 , and for a solitonic type of solution @xmath141 .",
    "the solution corresponding to the phases eqs.([phase2_k ] ) , ( [ phase2_k ] ) describes the nonlinear interaction of fast and slow - light solitons .",
    "this solution is parameterized by the constants @xmath142 defining the position and phase of the two solitons . as we have already indicated above , the phase @xmath123 determines the position of the slow - light soliton whereas @xmath124 determines the position of the fast signal . in practice",
    "these constants @xmath142 are defined by the initial condition , which specifies the actual pulse of light entering the medium at the point @xmath143 . to understand the structure of the slow - light soliton one can set @xmath144 .",
    "this choice corresponds to taking the fast soliton to @xmath145 in the variable @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , this specification removes the fast pulse component corresponding to @xmath124 and thus singles out the slow - light soliton part .",
    "the slow - light soliton solution assumes then the following form : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the phase of the slow - light soliton . for simplicity , in the following we let @xmath148 . from the expression above and in the simplifying approximation @xmath149 , @xmath150 the group velocity of the slow - light soliton",
    "can be easily derived : @xmath151 the pure state of the atomic subsystem corresponding to the slow - light soliton solution reads @xmath152 notice that the population of the upper level @xmath5 is proportional to the intensity of the background field .",
    "the speed of the slow - light soliton is also proportional to @xmath153 .",
    "this means that the slower the soliton , the smaller the population of the level @xmath5 and , therefore , the dynamics of the nonlinear system as a whole is less affected by the relaxation process .    to understand the structure of the fast soliton one can choose @xmath154 .",
    "we then arrive at an expression describing a signal moving on the constant background with the speed of light ( fast soliton ) : @xmath155 where the phase of the fast soliton is @xmath156 the atomic state is described by the function @xmath157 we emphasize the principal difference between fast and slow - light solitons .",
    "the slow - light soliton vanishes when the controlling field is zero due to the factor @xmath158 in eq.([sl_field_a ] ) .",
    "another important feature is that for the slow - light soliton the population of the upper level @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath39 and is small for small background fields and therefore stable to optical relaxation . in contrast",
    ", the amplitude of the fast signal is not limited by @xmath39 and is determined by the spectral parameter @xmath159 .",
    "the population of the level @xmath5 is also defined by @xmath159 , which means that for large spectral parameters the fast signal will be attenuated by the relaxation .",
    "as we discuss below , in the absence of the background field the fast signal behaves as a conventional sit soliton in a two level system @xmath160 .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec2 ] illustrates the propagation and collision of the fast and slow - light solitons according to equation eqs.([omega_a_gen ] ) , ( [ omega_b_gen ] ) . the figure for @xmath161 shows the intensities of the signals in channel @xmath10 .",
    "we see that before the collision only the slow - light soliton exists in channel @xmath10 , while after the collision the slow - light soliton disappears and a fast intensive signal appears , whose velocity is slightly below the speed of light .",
    "the figure for @xmath161 is complemented by the figure for the intensity @xmath162 of the field in channel @xmath12 .",
    "the slow - light soliton corresponds to a groove in the background field @xmath39 .",
    "it is clearly seen that after the collision the slow - light soliton ceases propagating in channel @xmath12 , while some trace of the fast soliton still can be noticed in that channel .",
    "the process described above can be summarized as if the fast soliton destroys the slow - light soliton .",
    "the notion of a transparency gate requires the existence of two distinctly different regimes , which are transparent ( open gate ) , and opaque ( closed gate ) . in the absence of the fast soliton",
    "the gate is open for the slow - light soliton . when the fast soliton is present the slow - light soliton is destroyed , while the fast intensive signal created after the collision in channel @xmath10 is attenuated due to strong relaxation in the atomic subsystem .",
    "the gate thus closes in the course of the dynamics due to the relaxation process . to further explain this process we provide the fig .",
    "[ fig : spec2 ] plots for populations of the levels @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "notice that before the collision the population of the upper atom level @xmath5 is negligible and is approximately given by the formula for the slow - light soliton solution eq.([ss_wavefun ] ) ( see the lower right plot of p3 ) .",
    "the populations of the lower levels @xmath163 are determined by the slow - light soliton ( see the lower left plot of p1 ) .",
    "indeed , the fast signal existing in channel @xmath12 does not interact with the atoms because at the onset of the dynamics their state coincides with the dark state @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec2 ] shows that after the collision the atoms of the active medium are highly excited and therefore the level @xmath5 is strongly populated .",
    "this leads to the fast attenuation of the rapid intensive signal in channel @xmath10 due to the relaxation . the optical gate closes .     knocking down the slow - light soliton .",
    "the two upper plots correspond to the dynamics of the intensities of the fields @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "the two lower plots show the populations of the levels @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "the parameters of plotted solutions are @xmath166.,width=340 ]    to this point we have described a mechanism of controlling the transparency of the medium for a particular type of slowly moving signals .",
    "we now discuss a possibility to read information stored in the atomic subsystem .",
    "let us assume that the background field vanishes , i.e. @xmath167 . as was explained above , the speed of the slow - light soliton then vanishes as well .",
    "however , the information about polarization of the slow - light signal is stored in the atomic subsystem .",
    "this effect can be interpreted in terms of the concept of a polariton , which is a collective excitation of the overall atom - field system .",
    "the notion of a polariton for the @xmath0-system has been used before . in the linear case",
    "the dark - state polariton was discussed in @xcite . in the strongly nonlinear regime , which is the case for the present work ,",
    "a similar interpretation is possible .",
    "indeed , the field component of a slow - light soliton solution can be interpreted as the light contribution into the slow - light polariton .",
    "when the controlling field @xmath39 vanishes this contribution also vanishes , along with the speed of the polariton .",
    "the latter then contains only excitations in the atomic subsystem . the general solution eqs.([omega_a_gen ] ) , ( [ omega_b_gen ] ) is then reduced to the form :    @xmath168 } { \\cosh(\\phi_{s0 } ) + \\frac12 \\exp\\left[{2\\phi_{f0}-\\phi_{s0}}\\right]},\\nonumber\\\\    &   \\tilde\\omega_b = e^{i\\varphi_1+\\log(c_2)-\\frac{i\\nu_0\\zeta } { 2(\\delta+i \\varepsilon_0)}}\\ ; \\tilde\\omega_a,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath169 is the phase of the slow - light soliton , and @xmath170 is the phase of the fast soliton for the vanishing background @xmath39 .",
    "the form of the fields resembles a superposition of fast and slow - light solitons in eqs.([omega_a_gen ] ) , ( [ omega_b_gen ] ) with the vanishing velocity of the slow - light soliton .",
    "this last exponential term in the denominator represents the fast signal contribution .",
    "the component containing hyperbolic cosine describes the information about the slow - light soliton stored in the medium after the soliton was stopped .",
    "the overall picture of dynamics corresponds to the scattering of the fast soliton on this localized atomic polarization pattern .",
    "the atomic state describing this scattering reads @xmath171 } { \\sqrt{\\delta^2+\\varepsilon_0 ^ 2}\\;\\left({e^{2\\phi_{s0}}+1 + e^{2\\phi_{f0}}}\\right)}\\;|2\\rangle -\\frac{\\tilde\\omega_a}{2\\sqrt{\\delta^2 + \\varepsilon_0 ^ 2}}|3\\rangle .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath144 the fields vanish , while the atomic state reduces to a form corresponding to a stopped polariton described by eq.([ss_wavefun ] ) with @xmath167 .",
    "in other words , when the slow - light soliton is completely stopped , the information borne by the soliton is stored in the spin polarization of the atoms . as long as the upper state @xmath5 is not populated ,",
    "the state of the atomic subsystem is not sensitive to the destructive influence of the optical relaxation processes .",
    "the conventional way @xcite to read the information stored in the atoms is to increase the intensity of the background field .",
    "our method of reading the information is different .",
    "we propose to send the fast soliton into the space domain in the active medium , where the information is stored .",
    "the polarization in the domain is then flipped by the fast signal .",
    "this is how the reading of information is realized .",
    "this way of reading optical information is advantageous because it involves fast easily detectable processes .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec3 ] illustrates the mechanism of the reading . notice that the act of reading , based on the polarization flipping induced by the fast signal , can be realized on a very short time scale compared to typical relaxation times .",

    "it is worth discussing here a possibility to actually create in the @xmath0-type atomic medium the slow - light solitons .",
    "the general physical feature underlying the mathematical property of complete integrability is a delicate balance between the effects of dispersion and nonlinearity inherent in the medium .",
