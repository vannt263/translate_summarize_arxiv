    "the so - called hole - electron doping symmetry in the high-@xmath1 cuprates has been one of central interests in relation to the mechanism of the high-@xmath1 superconductivity .",

    "the superconducting phases appear through doping holes or electrons into the mott insulators .",
    "these properties lead to the view of hole - electron doping symmetry .",
    "on the other hand , some properties in the electron - doped superconductors have been found to be different from those in the hole - doped superconductors , leading to the hole - electron doping asymmetry .",

    "the long - range antiferromagnetic order survives up to @xmath17 @xmath18 0.13 @xcite , while it survives only up to @xmath17 @xmath18 0.02 in the hole - doped system of la@xmath12sr@xmath16cuo@xmath15 .",
    "second , in the inelastic neutron - scattering measurements , an incommensurate spin - correlation , which may be due to the so - called dynamically fluctuating stripes of spins and holes @xcite , has been found in the hole - doped system @xcite . in the electron - doped system ,",
    "on the other hand , a commensurate spin - correlation , which is related to the simple antiferromagnetic order , has been observed @xcite . as for impurity effects , different behaviors between the hole- and electron - doped systems are also observed . for examples ,",
    "the superconductivity in the electron - doped system is suppressed through the substitution of magnetic ni for cu more markedly than through the substitution of nonmagnetic zn for cu @xcite , which is contrary to the result in the hole - doped system @xcite .    from the view point of effects of nonmagnetic impurities on the cu - spin dynamics ,",
    "formerly , we have performed zero - field ( zf ) muon - spin - relaxation ( @xmath0sr ) measurements in a wide range of hole concentration of @xmath17 = 0.10 - 0.30 in the hole - doped high-@xmath1 superconductor la@xmath12sr@xmath16cu@xmath4zn@xmath5o@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it has been found that a slight amount of zn tends to induce slowing down of the cu - spin fluctuations in the whole superconducting regime , which is able to be interpreted as being due to pinning and stabilization of the dynamically fluctuating stripes of spins and holes .",

    "the superconductivity in the electron - doped system of pr@xmath2lace@xmath3cu@xmath4zn@xmath5o@xmath19 is affected by the value of @xmath8 , so that the samples are grouped into four classes with different @xmath8 values : as - grown ( @xmath8 = 0 ) , very small @xmath8 ( @xmath8 @xmath27 0.01 ) , small @xmath8 ( 0.01 @xmath9 @xmath8 @xmath27 0.04 ) and large @xmath8 values ( 0.04 @xmath9 @xmath8 @xmath9 0.09 ) .     on the zn - concentration @xmath7 of pr@xmath2lace@xmath3cu@xmath4zn@xmath5o@xmath19 with small @xmath8 ( 0.01 @xmath9 @xmath8 @xmath27 0.04 ) and large @xmath8 values ( 0.04 @xmath9 @xmath8 @xmath9 0.09 ) .",

    "taking into account the fact that the cu - spin dynamics strongly depends on @xmath8 as well as the ce concentration @xcite , the temperature - dependent change of the spectra above 30 k in both small and large @xmath8 values is not regarded as being due to the cu - spin dynamics but due to static random magnetism of small magnetic moments of pr@xmath10 ions induced by the mixing of the excited state in the crystal electric field @xcite .",

    "the dual existence of the static magnetism of pr@xmath10 moments and the cu - spin fluctuations has been confirmed from lf-@xmath0sr measurements .",
