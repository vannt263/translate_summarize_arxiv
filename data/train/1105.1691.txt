    "<S> the amplitude of the high - temperature component decreases at the expense of another , quickly relaxing component [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) ] . the latter prevails below 20  k where the data again fit well to the vkt relaxation function [ eq .  ( [ vkt ] ) ] , this time with @xmath22 and significantly increased static internal fields , @xmath23  mt [ inset to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the largely enhanced @xmath24 can only be attributed to electronic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the observed dip and the zf polarization leveling at 1/3 for longer times @xcite affirm that local fields are _ disordered _ and _ fully frozen _ on the muon time scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that absence of coherent oscillation of polarization discards the possibility of a lro state down to at least 63  mk [ inset to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the wtf measurements further disclose the magnetic state of cuncn between 80  k and 20  k , where multicomponent zf relaxation is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the oscillating polarization , proportional to the fraction of muons still experiencing dynamical electronic fields , gradually decreases in this range . </S>",
    "<S> this witnesses progressive development of static internal magnetic fields of electronic origin [ `` frozen '' fraction in fig .  [ fig2](b ) ] , whose magnitudes are large compared to the applied field . </S>",
    "<S> this phase is inhomogeneous as part of the muons detects static and the rest dynamical local fields . </S>",
    "<S> the wtf measurements confirm a fully static phase below 20  k.    the single - dip zf muon relaxation observed in cuncn below 20  k is commonly encountered in spin glasses ( sg ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sg states have been detected by @xmath14sr in several frustrated afms @xcite and appear due to some sort of randomness ; structural disorder , random fields , bonds or strains , topological defects , etc . </S>",
    "<S> one could therefore hastily assign the cuncn ground state as a sg state . </S>",
    "<S> such state is generally characterized with a pronounced zero - field - cooled / field - cooled ( zfc / fc ) irreversibility in @xmath9 below the freezing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we have , therefore , searched for the zfc / fc irreversibility @xcite and for signs of a sg transition in the ac susceptibility in various applied field between 0.8  mt and 5  t , but could not find any . </S>",
    "<S> another peculiarity of cuncn , uncharacteristic for sgs , is the anomalous stability of the inhomogeneous region of coexisting static ( low-@xmath4 ) and dynamic ( high-@xmath4 ) phase [ fig .  </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) @xmath4-dependence of the `` frozen '' fraction , deduced from weak - transverse - field measurements . ]    </S>",
    "<S> although low-@xmath4 @xmath14sr results in cuncn reveal static frozen fields , it is the absence of thermal remanence and well defined freezing temperature that rules out the canonical sg scenario . </S>",
    "<S> a similarly inhomogeneous phase has been reported in the frustrated kagom compound vesignieite and reasoned to be due to a vicinity of a quantum critical point @xcite . on the other hand , in few spin - gap systems </S>",
    "<S> partially frozen disordered states were unexpectedly detected by @xmath14sr @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they were attributed to a muon locally perturbing exchange pathways thus prohibiting singlet formation and liberating spin degrees of freedom in its vicinity @xcite . for slow dynamics , </S>",
    "<S> a local - probe muon would not distinguish such a state from collective spin freezing . </S>",
    "<S> this is plausible in cuncn , as muons are likely to stop near bridging n atoms of the ncn@xmath1 groups , similarly as protons are positioned in related @xmath0(ncnh)@xmath25 ( @xmath0 = fe  ni ) @xcite .    to avoid any disturbance of the cuncn structure by external probes we next decided to employ @xmath26n ( @xmath27 ) nmr measurements because intrinsic @xmath26n nuclei also directly detect local magnetic fields . to obtain a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio the frequency - swept spectra were measured in high magnetic field of 9.4  t @xcite .     of @xmath26n nmr spectra and bulk susceptibility @xmath28 ( in 5  t ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) exhibits a characteristic quadrupolar powder line shape , which allows fixing the quadrupolar interaction parameters , @xmath30  mhz and @xmath31 . in order to simulate the low-@xmath4 spectra </S>",
    "<S> we assume a convolution with a @xmath4-dependent gaussian local field distribution with the width @xmath32 originating from the hyperfine coupling between the nuclear and cu@xmath3electronic moments . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3](a ) ] , thus ruling out the distribution of hyperfine couplings as the source of the spectral broadening . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , spin - spin relaxation measurements ( not shown ) discard an increase in the relaxation rate as a possible origin of the low-@xmath4 broadening , which is therefore inhomogeneous and due to a broad distribution of local susceptibilities ( _ static electronic moments _ ) at low @xmath4 and high fields .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 dependence of the @xmath26n spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath29 , measured with an inversion recovery technique , reveals the development of electronic spin dynamics since the fast spin - lattice relaxation times of only a few ms [ fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath26n magnetization relaxation curves were analyzed with the stretched exponential model @xmath34 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath29 shows no obvious anomaly at 80  k , the stretch exponent @xmath35 clearly starts to decrease below 80  k and reaches a value of 0.5 at lowest @xmath4 [ inset ( i ) to fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the electronic properties of cuncn were , therefore , also investigated at much lower fields ( @xmath39  t ) with continuous - wave esr measurements in x - band ( @xmath40  ghz ) , following both fc and zfc temperature treatments . </S>",
    "<S> the esr spectra [ inset ( i ) to fig .  </S>",

    "<S> 10-times narrower gaussian component . </S>",
    "<S> the rt @xmath38-factor value @xmath41 of the broad component is common for cu@xmath3 in a square planar environment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the broad - component esr intensity , corresponding to the spin - only susceptibility , was calibrated at rt with a couple of standards , @xmath42  emu / mol . </S>",
    "<S> it is the same as the bulk susceptibility , which proves that the broad component represents the intrinsic esr signal . </S>",
    "<S> the narrow component , on the other hand , is ca .  </S>",
    "<S> 100-times less intense and exhibits a curie - like @xmath4-dependence . </S>",

    "<S> the intrinsic esr component exhibits a minimum in the line - width and a maximum in @xmath38-factor around 130  k [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> both indicate growth of spin correlations @xcite , which appear particularly strong below @xmath44  k. the featureless @xmath4-dependence of both parameters and no obvious zfc / fc dissimilarities of esr spectra speak against a conventional sg transition , in line with the lack of usual susceptibility fingerprints of such a state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the intrinsic @xmath45 rapidly diminishes below 80  k , thus diverging from @xmath9 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) ] .    </S>",

    "<S> below the upper critical temperature @xmath47 a quasi-1d gapless rvb phase sets in , while a 2d gapped rvb phase appears at the lower critical temperature @xmath48 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have further developed the analytical susceptibility expression @xcite for the 2d rvb phase and arrive at @xmath49 where @xmath50 , with @xmath51 , @xmath52 as the 1d , 2d rvb order parameters , respectively ; @xmath53 is a fermi distribution function and @xmath54 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> assuming constant @xmath55 @xcite in the 2d rvb phase we estimate the exchange constants @xmath56  k and @xmath57  k and establish the @xmath4-dependence of the 2d rvb order parameter [ inset ( ii ) to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) ] from @xmath58 for @xmath59  k.    we note that both rvb phases are characterized by complete spin - pairing , in agreement with no magnetic neutron scattering in polarized experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the growing spin correlations observed in esr are also in line with the 2d rvb phase below @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> this phase , however , appears to be very fragile , as muons can locally distort singlets and lead to static local states within the spin gap @xmath61 below @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as @xmath62 is comparable to the applied magnetic field in nmr , it is reasonable to assume that the lack of the spin gap and the growing static fields observed in nmr may be field induced . </S>",
    "<S> this calls to mind the recently discovered emergence of inhomogeneous moments in extremely weak fields on another triangular lattice @xcite and points to the importance of frustration which amplifies the role of small perturbations in selecting between competing spin - liquid and more conventional frozen phases .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , cuncn , the first nitrogen - based analogue of cuo , with a surprisingly low magnetic susceptibility , lacks magnetic ordering down to at least 63  mk . </S>",
    "<S> a magnetically highly disordered state has been witnessed below 80  k by complementary local probes . alternatively to a sg - like frozen state featuring an unprecedented broadness of inhomogeneous static and dynamic phase , no well - defined freezing temperature and no conventional susceptibility - fingerprint sg features , </S>",
    "<S> a dynamical spin liquid is proposed . </S>",
