    "in a recent series of papers @xcite , jeon and yaffe ( jy ) have derived expressions for the transport functions for a real , self - interacting scalar field in flat space , from first principles , using the kubo formulas @xcite and the imaginary - time formalism of thermal field theory .",
    "a necessary step in evaluating transport functions using the kubo formulas is taking the zero - frequency limit of the time - fourier - transformed spatial correlator of the energy momentum tensor . in order to avoid infrared divergences which arise in taking the @xmath1 limit , a complicated set of resummations of ladder diagrams had to be performed @xcite .",
    "however , it was observed in @xcite that the same integral equations for the transport functions obtained from the kubo formulas can be derived from an _ effective kinetic theory _ _ _ which takes into account the one - loop finite - temperature corrections to the mass of quasiparticles in the scalar theory , and to the effective vertices for quasiparticle scattering . in their treatment , the effective kinetic theory is presented as a physically well - motivated , but phenomenological , theory , whose justification is taken to be the fact that it gives transport properties which agree with the leading - order nonperturbative results computed using thermal field theory .",
    "we demonstrate in this work that , in fact , the effective kinetic equations for @xmath2 theory proposed by jeon and yaffe are derivable from a kinetic theory of quantum fields constructed earlier by two of us @xcite following the work of kadanoff and baym et al @xcite and continued by many others @xcite .",
    "in particular their effective kinetic equations are derivable in our approach from the closed - time - path ( ctp ) , two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action @xcite truncated at four loops for the @xmath3 theory .",
    "even though the calculation of higher loop effects is necessarily involved technically , we feel the quantum kinetic field theory approach is conceptually clearer and methodically simpler than jeon and yaffe s approach , as the success of the latter requires clever rendition of diagrammatic resummations which is neither straightforward nor fail - safe .",
    "for example , the usual form of boltzmann equation derived in , say , @xcite assumes 2 - 2 particle scattering , which conserves particle number , but bulk viscosity arises from particle nonconserving processes ( this was emphasized by jy ) .",
    "when we take into account 2 - 4 or 4 - 2 processes , we need to go to 4 loop diagrams in the boltzmann and the gap equations which will no longer assume the simpler form familiar in the usual derivations based on 2 - 2 processes . this extra effort is expected for tackling higher order effects but within the same context of the same fundamental ( not effective ) kinetic theory .",
    "we show that the derivation of the effective kinetic equations from the ctp-2pi effective action requires only the basic assumptions of kinetic theory : namely , the existence of a separation of macroscopic and microscopic time scales and the existence of well - defined ( perhaps modified ) ` on - shell ' asymptotic particle states @xcite .",
    "the assumption of weak coupling is also necessary in order to justify the neglect of yet higher - order scattering terms which arise in the collision integral for the derivation of a generalized boltzmann equation .",
    "the apparent reported ` failure ' of existing kinetic equations in the literature to account for the bulk viscosity of the scalar quantum field is due to the fact that previous work along this line entails perturbative expansions to insufficient accuracy , and not to any flaw or defect of the theory . when the calculation to a sufficient accuracy is performed , as done here , fundamental quantum kinetic field theory produces the `` effective kinetic theory '' of jeon and yaffe , in particular the result for the bulk viscosity reproduces jy s expression derived from linear response theory .",
    "more importantly perhaps , our method based on the ctp-2pi effective action illustrated here for a scalar field can be formulated entirely in terms of functional integral quantization , which makes it an appealing method for a first - principles calculation of transport functions of a thermal non - abelian gauge theory , e.g. , qcd quark - gluon plasma produced from heavy ion collisions .",
    "first- principles approach with a clear bearing on fundamental physics , involving nonlinear and nonperturbative effects , such as those employed here for this task , and elsewhere for related problems , are , in our opinion , essential for the successful establishment of a viable and useful quantum field theory of non - equilibrium processes .",
    "( for a sampling of current activities , see , e.g. , @xcite . )      let us begin by stating in simple terms what are the transport coefficients to be computed @xcite . for a real scalar field , there are no other conserved quantities than energy and momentum .",
    "since there is no fundamental concept of particle number ( equivalently , since the field describes both particles and antiparticles ) , chemical potential must be set to zero identically in the grand canonical ( equilibrium ) density matrix .",
    "equilibrium states are parametrized by the vector @xmath4,where @xmath5 is a timelike unit vector ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 is the inverse temperature .    in the semiclassical limit ,",
    "we define the energy momentum tensor @xmath8 as the expectation value of the corresponding heisenberg operator",
    ". @xmath9 may be decomposed with respect to @xmath10 as    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the minkowsky metric diag ( -1,1,1,1 ) ( for simplicity we shall work in flat spacetime , although a generally covariant formulation is readily available ) , thus defining the energy density @xmath13 and pressure @xmath14 .",
    "observe that there is no _ heat conduction _ , namely , that in the rest frame there is no energy flux .",
    "in this case this shall be true even in nonequilibrium states , since there are no currents other than four - velocity to break the isotropy of space in the rest frame .",
    "in other words , we are forced to adopt the landau - lifshitz formulation over eckart s .",
    "( see footnote below . )",
    "the functional dependences @xmath15 and @xmath16 define the equation of state in parametric form . the macroscopic description is completed by giving a concrete expression for the entropy flux @xmath17 , which must be consistent with the first law of thermodynamics @xmath18 . moreover , in equilibrium ,",
    "vanishing entropy production @xmath19 must follow from energy - momentum conservation @xmath20 .",
    "if we introduce the thermodynamic potential @xmath21 , consistency requires @xmath22 , and the identity    @xmath23    energy - momentum conservation implies the identities ( recall that @xmath24 )    @xmath25    where    @xmath26    since @xmath13 and @xmath14 become space dependent only through their temperature dependence , we may write @xmath27 , and similarly for @xmath14 . using the identity eq .",
    "( [ thermoid ] ) , eqs .",
    "( [ edcon ] ) simplify to    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the speed of sound .",
    "let us now consider a near equilibrium state , meaning that the properties of the actual state remain close to that of a conveniently chosen fiducial equilibrium state .",
    "there is some arbitrariness in this choice , but , following the so - called landau - lifshitz prescription @xcite , we shall choose the fiducial equilibrium state as that having the same four - velocity and energy density as the actual state .",
    "more precisely , we define the four velocity as the only timelike unit eigenvector of the actual energy momentum tensor @xmath30 ( assumed to satisfy suitable energy conditions ) , and then the energy density is defined as @xmath31 . knowing @xmath32 we may compute the temperature @xmath33 and pressure @xmath14 of the equilibrium state , and thus the departure of the actual @xmath30 from its value @xmath34 in the fiducial equilibrium state . observe that if we write @xmath35 , then by construction @xmath36 @xmath37 is usually parametrized in terms of the bulk @xmath38 and shear @xmath39 stresses , as @xmath40 , @xmath41    remaining within the so - called _ first order formalism _",

    "we wish to compute these coefficients as functions of the temperature and other parameters in the theory .",
    "since thermodynamics alone can not determine the dependence of the viscosity coefficients on temperature , to proceed we must place the macroscopic description within a more basic and comprehensive framework , i.e. , kinetic theory , where there is a well known method to extract the transport functions @xcite .",
    "the framework is a system described by a 1 - particle distribution function @xmath48 .",
    "there is a known prescription to compute the energy momentum tensor @xmath9 from the moments of the distribution function . in equilibrium",
    ", @xmath49 depends only on the inverse temperature 4-vector field @xmath50 the starting point is the transport equation for @xmath49    @xmath51 f = i_{col}[f ]   \\label{transport}\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 is the collision integral and @xmath53 is the mass of the particle ( with possible position dependence ) .",
    "@xmath49 is assumed to be of the form @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the local equilibrium distribution    @xmath56    where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is a perturbation .",
    "since the collision integral vanishes identically for local thermal equilibrium , we can write the collision integral as a linear integral operator @xmath59 acting on @xmath58    @xmath60=\\hat q[\\delta f ]   \\label{linearcol}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , if we neglect @xmath58 on the left hand side of the transport equation , we can write it as some differential operator acting on @xmath61 , thus obtaining a linear integral equation for @xmath58    @xmath62=q_e[\\partial _ t,\\partial _ i](\\beta _ \\mu ^0 ) \\label{lineartrans}\\ ] ]    the @xmath59 operator satisfies four constraints , which follow from energy - momentum conservation , namely    @xmath63    where @xmath64 enforces the on - shell condition .",
    "thus the equation for @xmath58 requires four integrability conditions    @xmath65(\\beta _",
    "\\mu ^0)=0 \\label{integrabcond}\\ ] ]    the integrability conditions reduce to a system of differential equations for @xmath66 , which are in fact the conservation laws for the energy - momentum tensor @xmath30 eqs .",
    "( [ sound ] ) .",
    "these equations allow us to eliminate time derivatives from the transport equation , which simplifies to    @xmath62= q_e[\\partial _ i](\\beta _",
    "\\mu ^0 )   \\label{reducedlintrans}\\ ] ]    on solving this equation , we determine the correction @xmath58 to the distribution function , and thereby the correction to the energy momentum tensor .",
    "in general the terms containing @xmath58 will contribute a term @xmath67 to the energy density ; thus we define the physical temperature @xmath33 from the condition @xmath68 , or equivalently @xmath69 , where @xmath70 knowing the temperature @xmath33 we may compute the energy momentum tensor @xmath71 in the fiducial state , subtract it from the physical @xmath30 to determine the nonequilibrium part @xmath37 , and then read out the viscosity coefficients by matching it to the form given in eq .",
    "( [ noneq ] ) .      from the discussion above",
    ", we may identify the main steps involved in computing the transport functions , namely :    \\1 ) find a description of the system in terms of a 1-particle distribution function @xmath49 , and the corresponding transport equation ,    \\2 ) find the structure of equilibrium states , including the expression of conserved currents in terms of @xmath49 , and the equilibrium equation of state ;    \\3 ) solve the linearized transport equation to obtain the response of the system to gradients in the hydrodynamical variables , and read out the nonequilibrium stresses .",
    "step 1 is done in detail in @xcite , where the self - energy is computed to 2-loops accuracy , giving as a result that , for a @xmath72 type interaction , the transport equation for @xmath49 is simply the relativistic boltzmann equation for bose particles , with the only modification of allowing for a variable mass as in eq .",
    "( [ transport ] ) .",
    "this vlasov type correction takes into account the fact that the physical mass @xmath53 of the particles is connected to the temperature through the gap equation , and thereby @xmath53 becomes position dependent if @xmath33 is .",
    "the ( only ) conserved current @xmath30 is defined as the expectation value of the corresponding heisenberg operator , and the hydrodynamic variables are read out from it , so step ( 2 ) does not present great difficulty .",
    "the problem arises in step ( 3 ) , because the boltzmann collision operator satisfies , besides the four conservation laws associated to energy - momentum , a fifth constraint    @xmath73    associated to the conservation of particle number in binary collisions .",
    "there is therefore a fifth integrability condition , and the system of macroscopic equations for @xmath74 and @xmath5 becomes overdeterminated .",
    "one could hope that the fifth constraint would be true just as a consequence of the other four , but we shall show below that in an interacting theory this is not the case .    continuing on this route , the linearized transport equation built out of the boltzmann collision operator is not integrable , and the calculation grinds to a halt .",
    "if we are going to compute the bulk viscosity out of quantum kinetic theory , then the collision operator can not be just boltzmann s derived from 2 - 2 collision processes . a generalized collision operator including particle number changing terms besides the usual binary scattering terms is needed .",
    "thus the fifth constraint has to be lifted to eliminate the inconsistency .",
    "however , in the `` effective kinetic theory '' of jeon and yaffe these new terms are not derived but rather postulated to match an independent calculation of cross sections from linear response theory .",
    "we feel that it is conceptually and methodically more gratifying if these terms can be derived _",
    "ab initio _ from a kinetic theory of quantum fields .",
    "this is indeed possible , as our present work aims to demonstrate .    since these particle number",
    "changing interactions are higher order in the coupling constant ( for pure @xmath75 theory they appear at @xmath76th order ) , it is to be expected that they may be retrieved by simply carrying the calculation in @xcite to a higher loop order .",
    "however , there appears a matter of principle : if we are going to work to high ( eventually , arbitrarily high ) order in perturbation theory , we can not _ assume _ that the green functions will look anything like those of the free theory .",
    "thus we must first confront the need to provide a non perturbative definition of the 1-particle distribution function , ( which should of course reduce to the one used in @xcite at first order in perturbation theory ) . in equilibrium , this problem is solved by the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) theorem ( @xcite ) , which implies the proportionality of the fourier transforms of the hadamard and jordan propagators ( see below ) . off equilibrium , following @xcite , we shall define the 1-particle distribution function from the ratio of the partial fourier transforms of these propagators .",
    "familiarity with the kms theorem and the kadanoff - baym equations should not blind us to the highly nontrivial nature of this definition . with this",
    "we will then have come to a full circle of deliberations for consistency .    for the specific goal laid out for this investigation , the main technical difficulty lies in the analysis of the collision term giving rise to the bulk viscosity , as it is due to the particle - changing processes which even in the leading order already involve 4 loop self - energy diagrams .",
    "this is one of the main tasks we need to overcome .",
    "the outline above provides us with a step by step guide to computing transport functions in quantum kinetic field theory , which we shall execute in the following sections . as noted above",
    ", the first step is the precise definition of the 1-particle distribution function , which is discussed in sec .",
    "2 . in sec .",
    "3 we derive the transport equation . for simplicity , after showing that to lowest non trivial order the boltzmann collision operator is recovered , we shall write down only the terms related to particle number changing interactions . section 4 is dedicated to studying the equilibrium states of the field , with the aim of finding the precise equation of state .",
    "the results of sections 3 and 4 amount to a first - principles derivation of jeon and yaffe s effective kinetic theory from quantum field theory .",
    "finally , in section 5 we go through the actual calculation of the bulk viscosity , which in the appropriate limit reproduces jy s estimates from linear response theory .",
    "our specific goal is to show that by consistently extending the existing methods of quantum kinetic field theory ( see e.g. , @xcite ) to four- loop order , it is possible to account both for the shear and bulk viscosity of an interacting scalar field , as computed by jeon and yaffe .",
    "we shall consider a purely quartic interaction , although for the application to gauge theories cubic plus quartic would seem closer to what is needed .",
    "since bulk viscosity entails particle number changing scattering , and these processes appear for the first time at @xmath77 , we must push the calculation through to five loops in the closed time path ( ctp ) two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action ( ea ) @xcite , which will yield four loops in the equations of motion for the propagators .",
    "we shall assume that the background field vanishes identically , so we shall look at the 2pi - ea as a functional of the propagators alone @xcite .",
    "let us begin with the classical action for a quartically self - interacting scalar field in minkowski space . using a modification of dewitt s notation in which capital letters denote both spacetime ( @xmath78 ) and time branch ( 1 , 2 ) indices @xcite",

    "this assumes that the expectation value of the heisenberg field operator @xmath91 vanishes .",
    "the two - point function @xmath92 is the lowest - order nonvanishing correlation function for the space of initial conditions with which we are presently concerned",

    "this means taking into account the feynman graphs in figures 1 to 5 @xcite .",
