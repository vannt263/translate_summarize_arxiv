    "decays are presented .",
    "both experiments , babar and belle , together have now a total sample of 1.3 billion @xmath10 pairs available .",
    "the oldest member of the family of new charmonium - like states is the @xmath0 , discovered by belle in 2003  @xcite . despite several measurements of its properties at b - factories and at the tevatron the nature of this particle",
    "is still unknown .",
    "it does not fit into the predicted spectrum of conventional chamonium states . since its mass is very close to the @xmath11 threshold the hypothesis of a @xmath11 molecule",

    "it is also possible , though unlikely , that the @xmath0 is a @xmath12 state and our theoretical models fail to describe it .",
    "therefore the observation of the @xmath13 was received with great interest .",
    "as it is charged it can not be a conventional charmonium state .",

    "a template fit is performed that takes into account threshold effects .",
    "while the width of @xmath22 mev is consistent with other measurements , the mass of @xmath23 mev does not agree with of the mass of @xmath24 mev that is obtained by averaging the measurements in the @xmath25 mode .",
