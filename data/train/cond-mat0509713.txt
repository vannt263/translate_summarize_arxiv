    "directed percolation ( dp ) can be thought of simply as a percolation process on a directed lattice in which connections are allowed only in a preferred direction , e.g. , on hyper - cubic lattices connections are only allowed along edges connecting vertices with increasing coordinates .",
    "dp is most commonly interpreted as a growth model and the preferred direction @xmath1 is time .",
    "bond percolation is also a special case of a @xmath4-dimensional stochastic cellular automaton @xcite . on the square lattice",
    "the evolution is governed by the transition probabilities @xmath5 , with @xmath6 if the vertex @xmath7 is occupied and 0 otherwise , which is the probability of finding the vertex @xmath2 in state @xmath8 at time @xmath1 given that , at time @xmath9 , the vertices @xmath10 and @xmath11 were in states @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "bond percolation corresponds to the choice @xmath14 .",
    "the behavior of the model is controlled by the spreading probability ( or density of bonds ) @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath15 is smaller than a critical value @xmath3 all clusters remain finite , and in this sub - critical region any initial population will eventually die out . above @xmath3",
    "there is a non - zero probability of finding an infinite cluster , the average cluster - size @xmath16 diverges as @xmath17 , and the initial population will increase exponentially fast .",
    "directed percolation , and a closely related continuous time version the contact process @xcite , serve as the prime examples of models for population growth exhibiting a non - equilibrium phase transition into an absorbing state ( a state from which the system can not escape ) , in these cases the state totally devoid of occupied sites .",
    "dp type transitions are also encountered in many other situations , perhaps most prominently in models for chemical reactions @xcite including heterogeneous catalysis and surface reactions @xcite .",
    "for a recent comprehensive review see @xcite    most studies of non - equilibrium systems have been limited to cases without disorder , that is the spreading probability is homogeneous in both time and space . obviously in many real systems this idealisation is unrealistic .",
    "often some degree of disorder is present , e.g. , in a real catalyst some sites may be blocked by impurities leading one to consider models with quenched spatial disorder . likewise in trying to model real growth processes",
    "one would like to consider temporal disorder so as to model changes in conditions from year to year , seasonal changes etc .",
    "non - equilibrium models with quenched spatial disorder were considered by kinzel @xcite .",
    "he argued that the harris criterion @xcite , well - known from disordered spin - systems , should apply for dp as well .",
    "harris argued that in systems with quenched disorder one must have @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the correlation length exponent .",
    "this means that quenched disorder is a relevant perturbation and thus should change the critical exponents if in the pure system @xmath20 .",
    "the harris criterion has been rigorously established for a large class of disordered systems by chayes @xcite . in the case of dp",
    "the harris criterion becomes @xmath21 , and quenched disorder is a relevant perturbation for @xmath22 .",
    "the effect of quenched disorder was studied numerically by noest @xcite who found a marked changed in the static critical exponents independent of the strength of the disorder .",
    "moreira and dickman @xcite used monte carlo simulations to study the site diluted two - dimensional contact process on the square lattice .",
    "they found a marked change in the static critical exponents @xmath23 and @xmath24 with a value of @xmath25 consistent with the harris criterion .",
    "the dynamic behaviour was found to be incompatible with the usual scaling observed in pure models . in particular critical spreading",
    "was found to be logarithmic rather than power law , and the survival probability in the sub - critical regime decayed algebraically rather that exponentially .",
    "this means that the dynamical critical correlation length exponent @xmath26 is undefined .",
    "janssen @xcite investigated the problem using renormalisation group theory and confirmed the findings of moreira and dickman .",
    "recently , hooyberghs , igli and vanderzande @xcite have investigated these problems using a real - space renormalisation group framework and the numerical technique of the density matrix renormalisation group .",
    "they found that for strong enough disorder the behaviour is controlled by a strong disorder fixed point , with logarithmic dynamical correlations and critical exponents different from the pure system . for weaker disorder",
    "the numerical evidence was consistent with continuously varying static exponents .",
    "kinzel @xcite also briefly considered the effect of temporal disorder and argued that a harris type criterion applied but with @xmath27 replaced with @xmath26 . since @xmath28 @xcite for ( 1 + 1)-dimensional dp this would make temporal disorder a relevant perturbation .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite we studied temporally disordered directed percolation on the square lattice using a simple model in which spreading from some rows was _ deterministic _ ( that is spreading takes place with probability 1 ) while spreading from the other rows took place with probability @xmath15 as in the pure model .",
    "disorder was introduced by letting any given row be `` deterministic '' with probability @xmath29 independent of other rows .",
    "the model was studied using high - density series expansions for the percolation probability and monte carlo simulations of growing clusters from a single seed .",
    "the major finding was that the critical exponents changed continuously with the strength of the disorder .",
    "in particular we found that @xmath30 over a wide range of values in apparent violation of the harris criterion .",
    "the model used in @xcite is not suitable for a low - density expansion so in this paper we study another model of dp with temporal disorder .",
    "the spreading probability @xmath31 is chosen at random to be either @xmath15 or @xmath32 with probability @xmath33 . by varying the parameter @xmath29 we can vary the strength of the disorder .",
    "there is an obvious symmetry between the two regions @xmath34 and @xmath35 and we shall therefore only consider the case @xmath35 .",
    "analysis of the series indicate that for any given value of @xmath29 there is critical point @xmath36 where the system has a phase transition . for values of the spreading probability",
    "@xmath15 close to @xmath36 the model changes from periods of sub - critical to periods of super - critical growth . for large values of @xmath29",
    "there is a very pronounced difference between the two regimes and the population dynamics changes from feast to famine . in the infinite lattice limit",
    "the system will have arbitrarily long stretches of ` famine ' conditions in which the population is rapidly reduced and very likely do die out .",
    "note that we can be sure that the model will have sub- and super - critical regions .",
    "we can simply choose @xmath37 , where @xmath3 is the critical point of the pure model , and we will always have a super - critical growth process , while for @xmath38 the growth process is always sub - critical .    in section  [ sec : calc ]",
    "we give a description of the method used to derive the low - density series for this model .",
    "the series is then analysed ( for various values of @xmath29 ) and the results presented in section  [ sec : ana ] .",
    "finally section  [ sec : sum ] contains a brief summary and discussion of the main results .",
    "in the low - density phase ( @xmath39 ) many quantities of interest can be derived from the pair - connectedness @xmath40 , which is the probability that the vertex at position @xmath2 is occupied at time @xmath1 given that the origin was occupied at @xmath41 .",
    "of particular interest are moments of the pair - connectedness    @xmath42    due to symmetry moments involving odd powers of @xmath2 are identically zero .",
    "the remaining moments diverge as @xmath15 approaches @xmath3 from below    @xmath43    in a previous paper @xcite we gave a detailed description of how the graph theoretical properties of the pair - connectedness @xcite can be turned into a very efficient algorithm for the calculation of low - density series expansions for ordinary directed percolation .",
    "the series expansions for the disordered model is a simple generalisation of this work . before describing the algorithm for the disorder system we will briefly review the pure case .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the pair - connectedness can be expressed as a sum over all graphs ( or finite clusters ) formed by taking unions of directed paths connecting the origin to the vertex @xmath44 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of bonds in @xmath47 .",
    "the weight @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the cyclomatic number of the graph @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath49 is increased by 1 whenever two paths join , e.g. , if there are two incoming bonds on a vertex .",
    "the restriction to unions of paths is very strong and one immediate consequence is that graphs with dangling parts make no contribution to @xmath50 and any contributing graph terminates exactly at @xmath0 .",
    "another way of stating the restriction is that any vertex with an incoming bond _ must _ have an outgoing bond unless it is the terminal vertex @xmath0 .",
    "any directed path to a vertex whose parallel distance from the origin is @xmath1 contains at least @xmath1 bonds .",
    "one can do much better by using a so - called non - nodal graph expansion @xcite to extend the series to order @xmath51 .",
    "a graph @xmath47 is nodal if it has a vertex ( other than the terminal vertex ) through which all paths pass .",
    "it is clear that each such nodal point effectively works as a new origin for the cluster growth , and we can obviously obtain any contributing graph by concatenating non - nodal graphs .",
    "note that the graph consisting of a single bond is non - nodal so all linear graphs can be obtained by repeated concatenations .",
    "this is the essential idea behind the non - nodal graph expansion , which proceeds in two principal steps .",
    "first we calculate the contribution @xmath52 of non - nodal graphs to the pair - connectedness .",
    "the calculation is done up to a preset order @xmath53 , where @xmath53 is limited by the available computational resources ( primarily physical memory ) .",
    "next we use repeated concatenation operations of @xmath52 to calculate the pair - connectedness @xmath50 and from this we finally calculate various moments @xmath54 .",
    "example of how the boundary line ( cutting through the filled circles ) is moved in order to insert another vertex ( shaded circle ) . ]",
    "the calculation of @xmath52 is done efficiently using transfer - matrix techniques .",
    "this involves drawing a boundary line across a finite slice of the lattice and then moving the boundary line such that one adds row after row with each row built up one vertex at a time , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : transfer ] .",
    "the sum over all contributing graphs is calculated as the lattice is constructed . at any given stage",
    "the boundary line cuts through a number of , say @xmath55 , vertices .",
    "there are two possible states ( 0 or 1 ) per vertex , corresponding to vertices with ( 1 ) or without ( 0 ) incoming bonds , leading to a total of @xmath56 possible boundary configurations .",
    "however , as explained in @xcite not all the @xmath56 possible configurations are required .",
    "many of them can be discarded because they either do nt make a contribution to @xmath52 or only contributes above order @xmath53 .",
    "the weight of each configuration is given by a polynomial @xmath57 in @xmath15 truncated at order @xmath53 .",
    "the updating of @xmath57 , as the boundary line is moved to insert a new vertex , depends only on the states of the vertices marked @xmath2 and @xmath11 in figure  [ fig : transfer ] and are given simply by    @xmath58    here @xmath59 is the configuration before the move which has the vertex at @xmath2 in state @xmath60 and the vertex at @xmath11 in state @xmath61 , while @xmath62 is the configuration after the move which has the new vertex at @xmath63 in state @xmath60 and the vertex at @xmath11 in state @xmath61 . for a derivation of the updating rules",
    "see @xcite .    limiting the calculation to non - nodal contributions",
    "is very simple ; whenever the boundary line reaches the horizontal position one just sets to zero the polynomials of states with a single incoming bond .",
    "this obviously ensures that configurations with a nodal point are deleted from the calculation .",
    "the pair - connectedness at the following time can be calculated from the states with incoming bonds at nearest neighbour sites and no incoming bonds on any other sites . in this way",
    "we calculate the two non - nodal series @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the generalisation to dp with temporal disorder is quite simple .",
    "first of all the configuration weights @xmath57 will depend on two variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 corresponding to the two spreading probabilities .",
    "lets consider the situation in which a row has just been completed . since the probability is @xmath33 that spreading from a given row occurs with probability @xmath66 or @xmath67 , respectively , obviously @xmath68 .",
    "next we insert a new row .",
    "formally we can express the weight of any new configuration @xmath69 as a weighted sum over the weights of the configurations @xmath70 in the row above @xmath71 from the nature of the problem it is clear that the weight @xmath72 is the same ( apart from the change of variable ) .",
    "this means that it is very simple to calculate the non - nodal expansion .",
    "having completed a row , we just use the updating rules in equation  ( [ eq : update ] ) with the spreading fixed at @xmath66 .",
    "this gives of a set of incomplete weights @xmath73 but since @xmath74 is symmetric in @xmath66 and @xmath67 we get the desired final result as @xmath75 note that this is a very efficient algorithm .",
    "naively one would have expected that to calculate the pair - connectedness one would have to sum over all @xmath76 realisations of the disorder . however , as we have just seen this is not necessary , the only complication being the requirement to maintain a two parameter generating function .",
    "ultimately we shall calculate series for @xmath54 , by fixing a value of @xmath29 and setting @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "so to need only retain the coefficients of @xmath79 provided @xmath80 .",
    "the first few terms in the expansion for @xmath81 are : @xmath82 note that @xmath83 is @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the non - nodal pair - connectedness of the pure model . in order to calculate our final series for the average cluster size @xmath16 and the moments @xmath86 and",
    "@xmath87 we simply fix a value of @xmath29 .",
    "we then use repeated concatenations of @xmath88 to calculate the pair - connectedness @xmath89 ( with @xmath29 fixed ) , which in turn we use to calculate the moments .",
    "the series for the second transverse moment @xmath90 is obtained as @xmath91 .",
    "the series for @xmath81 was derived correctly to order 115 ( that is all coefficients of @xmath79 were calculated exactly for @xmath92 ) .",
    "this obviously results is series for @xmath16 and the other moments to order 115 as well .",
    "the algorithm used up to 5 gb of physical memory and the total cpu time was about 30 days .",
    "the various series were analysed using inhomogeneous differential approximants @xcite . suffice to say that a @xmath93th - order differential approximant to a function @xmath94 is a solution to an inhomogeneous differential equation @xmath95 where the coefficients in the polynomials @xmath96 and @xmath57 of order @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively , are chosen so that the series for the function @xmath99 , agrees with the series coefficients of @xmath94 .",
    "the equations are readily solved as long as the total number of unknown coefficients in the polynomials is smaller than the order of the series @xmath100 .",
    "the possible singularities of the series appear as the zeros @xmath101 of the polynomial @xmath102 and the associated critical exponent @xmath103 is estimated from the indicial equation .",
