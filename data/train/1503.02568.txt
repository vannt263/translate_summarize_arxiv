    "were observed in the vicinity of the tbp sites : ( 1 ) the apical o1 shifts along @xmath4 towards the fe2 ion by 0.021(3 )   ( see fig .",
    "[ nuc ] ) .",
    "the distance between the o1 above and the o1 atom below fe2 is reduced by 0.042(6 )   ; and ( 2 ) the tbp fe2 displaces away from the mirror plane at @xmath38=0.25 by 0.177(4 )   and 0.098(9 )   at 295  k and 4  k , respectively .",
    "the omp displacement of the tbp fe2 is reduced upon cooling from 295  k to 4  k by 0.079(7 )   , much larger than the o1 shift , 0.021(3 )   , which is consistent with the notion that the tbp electric dipoles arise from off - centering into double wells .    to further understand the omp displacements",

    "as shown in the nuclear density map obtained by the mem analysis ( fig . [ dens ] ) , only tbp fe ions present a large displacement along the crystallographic @xmath4 axis , and this displacement is reduced when cooling from 295  k to 4  k. the displacements of other atoms including the oxygen ions ( o1 and o3 ) enclosing the tbp fe are isotropic , exhibiting conventional thermal vibrational features .",
    "therefore , a split tbp site along the @xmath4 axis is necessary for both temperatures .",

    ". both bonds are longer than the rest fe - o bonds at each temperature .",
    "obviously , these two fe2-o1 bonds show a significant temperature dependence .",
    "in contrast , the fe2-o3 bonds in the @xmath41-plane are much shorter with a length of 1.86   and show no temperature dependence within the error bar .",
    "the bond lengths of in - plane fe2-o3 bonds are close to those of the fe - o bonds ( fe3-o4 ) in the tetrahedral sites .",
    "in fact , each bipyramid can be viewed as two face - sharing tetrahedra , where the tbp fe@xmath2 hops from one tetrahedron to the other , forming an electric dipole . in order to look for possible long range order of the dipoles ,",
    "high resolution diffraction data were collected with both x - ray and neutron single crystal diffraction .",
    "no peak breaking the reflection condition @xmath42=2n within the space group @xmath43 was observed with neutron single crystal diffraction at 4 k. the absence of superlattice peaks was further confirmed with x - ray single crystal diffraction measurements performed in the temperature range 28 k-300 k ( results not shown ) .",

    "one question that remains is whether the displacement change of o1 and fe2 upon cooling is continuous or discontinuous .",
    "the absence of any noticeable anomaly in the temperature dependence of specific heat and electrical resistivity suggests that the displacement takes place in a continuous manner .",
    "this is consistent with the mssbauer study showing a continuous decrease of tbp fe2 displacement upon cooling @xcite . to further confirm this , we monitored the evolution with temperature of the integrated intensity of ( 0 0 22 ) reflection in the temperature range 4 k-300 k with single crystal neutron diffraction .",
    "the intensity of ( 0 0 22 ) peak increases also in a continuous manner upon cooling from room temperature ( results not shown ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the dielectric function , especially the non - classical @xmath5 temperature dependence of the inverse dielectric function below 20  k and an anomalous upturn below 1.40  k , strongly suggests that bafe@xmath0o@xmath1 is a ferrimagnetic quantum paralectric system on the verge of ferroelectricity .",
    "it is , in general , rare to find an ion that can play both magnetic and ferroelectric roles due to the empirical `` d0-ness '' rule in transition metal oxides@xcite .",
    "the problem comes from the fact that the formation of electric dipoles usually requires hybridization between empty _",
    "d_-orbitals of cations and the filled _",
    "2p _ oxygen orbitals , while the magnetic properties derive from partially filled _ d_-orbitals .",
    "recently , perovskite manganites , amno@xmath6 ( a = ca , sr , ba ) , were studied both theoretically and experimentally and the shift of magnetic mn@xmath49 ions in mno@xmath46 octahedra was found to produce electric dipoles @xcite . in bafe@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "the tbp fe ions contribute to both magnetic and local dipoles .",
    "it thus provides another materials platform which can be tuned to optimize the cross - coupling between magnetism and ferroelectricity .",
    "a recent study of dielectric properties of ba@xmath50sr@xmath51fe@xmath0o@xmath1 suggests that the local dipole moment decreases dramatically with the substitution of ba by sr @xcite .",
    "the reduced dipole moment is accompanied by the suppressed displacement of tbp fe ions .",
    "this signals the importance of the displacement of tbp fe ions for the dielectric properties of hexaferrites .",
    "it also indicates that srfe@xmath0o@xmath1 is further away from the antiferroelectric border , as schematically demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ dgm ] . with stress engineering , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , it might be possible to realize room temperature multiferroics by tuning the omp displacement .",
    "high quality single crystals of bafe@xmath0o@xmath1 have been grown using the floating zone technique in flowing oxygen atmosphere of 100 atm .",
    "single crystal neutron diffraction confirmed that the displacement of tbp fe ions decreases continuously with decreasing temperature .",
    "the displacement at 4  k is nonzero but about half of that at room temperature .",
    "the reduced displacement of tbp fe ions is accompanied by the oxygen displacement toward the tbp fe ions .",
    "the temperature dependence of the dielectric function shows a non - classical @xmath5 temperature dependence of the inverse dielectric function below 20  k and an anomalous upturn below 1.40  k extending to the millikelvin range .",
    "these results provide strong evidence that bafe@xmath0o@xmath1 is a ferrimagnetic quantum paraelectric compound on the border of ferroelectricity .",
    "as the tbp fe ions contribute to both magnetism and electric dipoles , bafe@xmath0o@xmath1 offers an ideal materials platform for tuning the coupling of magnetism and ferroelectricity .",
