    "the direct detection of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers gw150914 , gw151224 , and a possible third event lvt151012 , has drawn wide attention @xcite . the general anticipation that the first events would involve neutron stars rather than black holes mobilized massive coordinated campaigns to search for accompanying electromagnetic ( em ) counterparts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for merger events involving at least one neutron star ,",
    "a plethora of accompanying em signatures is expected at a range of timescales and wavelengths .",
    "in contrast , for binary black hole mergers the common consensus has been that no significant em counterpart is expected , except for `` those in highly improbable environments pervaded by large ambient magnetic fields or baryon densities '' as @xcite state .",
    "understandably , the report of a transient signal detected by the fermi gamma - ray burst monitor 0.4 seconds after the first event @xcite attracted considerable attention .",
    "it encouraged several theoretical speculations for a possible origin of this unanticipated em signal . but the lack of a corresponding detection by integral / spi - acs @xcite , careful reanalysis of the data @xcite and reassessment of the low count statistics @xcite all lead to the conclusion that the fermi trigger is consistent with a background fluctuation , and unlikely to be of astrophysical origin .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising : the ultra ",
    "prompt nature of the fermi signal implies an extremely small em source and probably the near  simultaneous formation of the second black hole , ruling out the usual formation channels .",
    "proposed scenarios include the exotic formation of a binary black hole inside a massive star @xcite , which has been ruled implausible @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the survival of a minidisk surrounding one of the individual black holes activated shortly before the merger @xcite implies timescales and luminosities inconsistent with the fermi signal @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the question whether binary black hole mergers can have em counterparts is natural and interesting .",
    "here we question the common consensus that the typical stellar  mass binary black hole merger is always dark .",
    "we consider a simple possibility for em signals following binary black hole mergers , with a possible delay of hours .",
    "this mechanism requires the bh binary to have a circumbinary disk at the time of merger whose mass need only be a very small fraction of that shed as the system evolved . in",
    "we argue that the initial formation of such a disk is natural in the two progenitor formation scenarios for isolated binary evolution , but unlikely if the binary formed through dynamical interactions in a cluster .",
    "we discuss the evolution of the disk under viscous and tidal stresses .",
    "if any such disk survives until coalescence , it is perturbed both by the gw recoil and by the sudden drop in mass as energy and momentum is radiated away by gravitational waves . in",
    "we use simple analytic scaling arguments , calibrated against earlier detailed simulations for supermassive black hole mergers , to provide crude estimates of the possible luminosity , delay time , duration and approximate spectral energy distribution of the resulting signal . in",
    "we emphasize that the detectability of these signals is subject to large uncertainties ; especially the survival of the disk until the merger , and how promptly photons escape it afterwards .",
    "if the em signals are detectable , coordinated searches should allow us to distinguish them from background contamination by active galactic nuclei , given the anticipated improvements of sky localization and possibly advance detection by elisa several years before coalescence .",
    "detection or non  detection of em signals will contribute unique insight into the earlier evolution of the merging black hole binaries , testing for circumbinary material and any post  merger recoil .",

    "the inflow rate is much lower near the mid plane of the disk , so there is a tendency for matter to accumulate in dead zones characterized by the local grain opacities @xcite .    adapting this picture to the circumbinary disk of a black hole binary is clearly complex .",

    "this is important since the resulting accretion luminosity can further ionize the disk .",

    "therefore , @xmath30 describes the delay with respect to the gw event and energy deposition in the disk .",
    "this means that we expect a minimum time delay of hours between the merger and the em signal , if photons are radiated away promptly .",
    "the time delay becomes longer , and can be years if a significant fraction of the radiation is trapped , as we discuss in _ 3 . _ below .",
    "disk dimensions : _ we define a typical radius @xmath31 such that the kepler velocity at this radius is equal to the recoil velocity @xmath32 in the typical case we expect @xmath33 , so that the inner radius of the disk falls within this radius ( cf . [ rin ] ) .",
    "the outer disk radius is much larger than when the disk was formed ( i.e. @xmath34 , as it must absorb the angular momentum of the gas which has spiraled inwards .",

    "_ 3 . peak luminosity _ : the expected rate of dissipation of kinetic energy is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a scaling factor .",
