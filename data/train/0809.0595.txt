    "observation of host galaxies of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is very important for understanding the nature of grbs .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) supports the collapsar model of long grbs ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; macfadyen , woosley & heger 2001 ) .",
    "in contrast , short - duration grbs are found in both early- and late - type galaxies , similar to the situation of type ia supernovae .",
    "the rate of star formation in the host galaxies of short grbs is often lower than that in the hosts of long grbs ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "so far no supernovae have been found to be associated with short grbs .",
    "the difference in the observed host properties for short and long grbs supports the idea that short and long grbs have different progenitors .",
    "long grbs are believed to arise from the death of massive stars ( the collapsar model)most likely the wolf - rayet stars since all observed supernovae associated with grbs are type ic , while short grbs are more likely produced by the merger of compact stars ",
    "neutron star - neutron star merger and black hole - neutron star merger ( li & paczyski 1998 ; oshaughnessy , kalogera & belczynski 2007 ) .",
    "however , the above scenario is challenged by the observation of grb 060614 .",
    "this is a long burst with a duration @xmath4  s , with a host galaxy at redshift @xmath5 @xcite . for a long grb that has such a low redshift",
    "it is expected that a supernova associated with it should be observed . however ,",
    "despite extensive observation on its host , no supernova has been found down to limits fainter than any known type ic sn and hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal sn 1998bw that accompanied grb 980425 .",
    "this challenges the ordinary grb classification scheme based on grb durations and the general belief that long grbs are produced by the core - collapse of massive stars @xcite .",
    "in fact , except its duration , grb 060614 is much like a short grb in many aspects . besides the fact that it has no associated supernova , grb 060614 has a vanishing spectral lag that is typical of short grbs @xcite .",
    "its lightcurve has a very hard and short - duration initial peak , followed by an extended soft emission . @xcite",
    "have shown that if this burst had an eight time smaller total energy , it would have been detected by batse as a marginal short - duration grb , and would have properties in the _ swift _ bat and xrt bands similar to grb 050724 .",
    "grb 060505 has a duration @xmath6 s and a host galaxy at @xmath7 .",
    "no supernova has been detected at the location of this burst also @xcite , so grb 060505 has also been considered as a long grb without a supernova . it has been argued that grb 060505 is indeed a short burst ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see , however , thne et al .",
    "2008 ; mcbreen et al .",
    "models for `` long grbs without supernovae '' have been proposed ( king , olsson & davies 2007 ) .    on the other hand , it has been suggested that grb 060614 and its host galaxy was just a coincidence rather than a physical association @xcite . by counting the number of galaxies observed by smarts in a field centered on the burst , @xcite showed that the probability for a chance superposition of grb 060614 and a galaxy along the line of sight is @xmath8 .",
    "this probability is high enough to cause that several cases of chance superposition may have happened for _ swift _ grbs .",
    "this conclusion is enforced by a more detailed study by @xcite .",
    "the results of cobb et al . have raised an important question in identifying grb host galaxies based only on the superposition of a grb and a galaxy on the sky @xcite . for a telescope with very high sensitivity",
    ", it would observe many galaxies on the sky , then the probability for a grb to be aligned with a galaxy could be high .",
    "then , unavoidably , some grb hosts discovered in this approach might be superficial , i.e. they are not physically related to the grbs .",
    "cobb et al . obtained their results by using galaxy survey data .",
    "it is interesting to verify these results with an independent , more theoretical approach .    in this paper , we calculate the probability for a grb to be coincident with a galaxy on the sky using galaxy luminosity functions and compare the results with that of cobb et al . obtained with different ways .",
    "then , we use our results to assess at what a level we can trust the grb host galaxies that have been found so far .",
    "the uvot on _ swift _ can resolve a source to sub - pixels ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "hence , in our calculations we regard a grb as a point source .",
    "the approach that we adopt has the benefit of extending beyond the limit of current surveys and to broader types of problems .",
    "for example , with slight modification it can be applied to the calculation of the probability of ly@xmath10 forests in the spectra of quasars and grbs which has important applications in probing the high-@xmath11 universe @xcite .",
    "the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) is a fundamental characteristics of the galaxy population and is essential for studying statistical properties of galaxies and their evolution .",
    "it gives the abundance of galaxies as a function of their luminosity , defined by the comoving number density of all galaxies with luminosity between @xmath12 and @xmath13 at redshift @xmath11 .",
    "the lf of a population of galaxies is usually described by the schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a characteristic luminosity , the constant @xmath10 is the faint - end slope , and @xmath16 is the normalization .",
    "these three parameters are determined by fitting the lf to the data from a galaxy survey .",
    "the lf is often expressed in terms of magnitudes rather than luminosities , which is more convenient to use in uv and optical observations . the absolute magnitude @xmath17 is related to the galaxy luminosity by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a characteristic magnitude corresponding to the characteristic luminosity @xmath15 .",
    "then , the schechter lf becomes @xmath20 dm \\;.       \\label{lum2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in a flat universe , the number of galaxies within a solid angle @xmath21 with magnitude in the range @xmath22@xmath23 and comoving distance @xmath24 in the range @xmath25@xmath26 is calculated by integral : @xmath27    the solid angle @xmath21 is the solid angle covered by a survey , and @xmath28 is the maximum absolute magnitude arising from the apparent magnitude limit @xmath29 of the telescope .",
    "the comoving distance to a galaxy at redshift @xmath11 is calculated by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the speed of light , @xmath32 is the hubble constant , @xmath33 is the fraction of mass contained in baryonic and dark matter in the universe , and @xmath34 is the fraction of mass contained in the cosmological constant or dark energy .    throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath35 km s@xmath36 mpc@xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the lf is one of the fundamental observational properties of galaxies , and the amount of work dedicated by different groups of people to derive an accurate lf is substantial .",
    "the lf has been measured from many galaxy surveys with differing sample selections and redshift coverage , and different outcomes are compared by de lapparent et al .",
    "the results in the literature have shown that there is no universal galaxy lf .",
    "instead , the galaxy lf evolves with redshift and galaxy morphology .",
    "it has been found that , in general , the faint - end lf of early - type galaxies is steeper than that of late - type galaxies , and the characteristic luminosity of early - type galaxies is smaller than that of late - type galaxies ( madgwick et al .",
    "2002 ; nakamura et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the lf of local galaxies is now well constrained by two large spectroscopic surveys : the two - degree field redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; e.g. norberg et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; e.g. blanton et al .",
    "the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) , which includes galaxies up to @xmath39 , showed that the lf evolves with the cosmic redshift and the evolution depends on the galaxy populations .",
    "for example , the cfrs survey shows unambiguously that the population evolves and that this evolution is strongly differential with color and , less strongly , with luminosity ( lilly et al .",
    "the lf of red galaxies changes little over @xmath40 , while the lf of blue galaxies shows substantial evolution at redshifts @xmath41 .    at higher redshift ,",
    "the evolution of lf in blue bands over the redshift range @xmath42 , and in red bands over the redshift range @xmath43 , has been derived from the fors deep field survey ( gabasch et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "the lf measurements for different galaxy types have been derived up to @xmath44 from the vvds survey ( zucca et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the lf for each type of galaxies separately .",
    "to calculate the probability for a grb to be coincident with a galaxy on the sky , we need to measure the projected radius of the galaxy on the sky .",
    "to do so , we associate with each galaxy a physical projected area , as a function of the redshift and of the luminosity of galaxies .    for an elliptical galaxy ,",
    "we assume that the area covered by the galaxy on the sky is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is an averaged radius . for a spiral or an irregular galaxy ,",
    "which is not spherical , we assume that the galaxy has a random distribution in orientation . for a spiral or an irregular galaxy with an inclination angle @xmath47 ,",
    "the area on the sky is @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "generally , the size of a galaxy is correlated with its luminosity .",
    "hence , the value of @xmath46 for a galaxy with a given luminosity can be derived from a statistical relation between the observed radius and luminosity , at a given redshift .",
    "the relation can be fitted by a power law @xmath50 where @xmath46 is in kpc and @xmath12 is in erg s@xmath36 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are constants that depend on the galaxy morphological types and on the bandpass of the telescope .",
    "dahlen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have shown that the galaxy size evolves strongly with redshift .",
    "in particular they have claimed that there is a similar evolution in the size - luminosity relation in several wavelengths , over the range @xmath53 .",
    "the evolution is consistent with the form @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the half - light radius of the galaxy .",
    "the ratio @xmath57 ( radius containing @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the flux ) is approximately constant for de vaucouleurs and exponential profile galaxies ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively ) , so we can assume that @xmath62 .",
    "the solid angle occupied by a galaxy is then @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the angular - diameter distance to the galaxy [ related to the comoving distance by etherington s reciprocity law @xmath65 ; etherington 1933 ] , @xmath66 is the projected area of the galaxy averaged over inclination .    for spherical or elliptical galaxies we have @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the radius of the galaxy . for disk spiral galaxies and irregular galaxies with a random distribution of inclination we have @xmath69",
    "the probability for a grb to be aligned to a galaxy is always small .",
    "hence , the probability is simply given by the ratio of the solid angle spanned by galaxies to the total solid angle @xmath70 where @xmath21 is the solid angle of space covered by a survey , and @xmath71 is the total solid angle occupied by galaxies .",
    "using relations ( [ number ] ) and ( [ area ] ) , the total solid angle occupied by galaxies is ( @xmath72 ) @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the maximum redshift that can be reached by a survey .",
    "then , by etherington s reciprocity law , we have @xmath75 we will adopt @xmath76 to compute @xmath66 .",
    "since the lf decays exponentially toward the bright end , the exact value of @xmath22 does not affect the final result .",
    "in our numerical calculation we take @xmath77 . for a given luminosity distance @xmath78 , the value of @xmath23 is related to the magnitude limit of the telescope , @xmath29 , by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the k - correction depending on the filter .",
    "the parameters in the lf are derived from the sdss and the vvds catalogs ( nakamura et al.2003 ; zucca et al .",
    "2006 ) and the radius - luminosity relation from the sdss catalogs ( york et al.2000 ; appendixes a & b ) .",
    "then , the probability can be calculated by equation ( [ gen3 ] ) .",
    "the calculated results of @xmath81 for the parameters in the @xmath82-band obtained from the vvds survey ( zucca et al .",
    "2006 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ probvvds ] ( solid line ) . in the calculations",
    "the k - corrections were provided by e. zucca ( see also fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa 1995 ) .    for a given galaxy survey ,",
    "the projected area of resolved galaxies on the sky can be measured",
    ". then equation ( [ gen ] ) can be directly applied to calculate the probability for chance coincidence of a grb with a galaxy on the sky . as an example , the fraction of the sky covered by galaxies in the hubble deep fields ( hdfs ) is @xmath83 if the boundary of a galaxy is defined by twice the isophotal radius containing @xmath84 flux ( bernstein , freedman , & madore 2002 ) .",
    "for those grbs with known hosts , we find out the distribution of the distance , projected on the sky , between the grb s position and the center of the associated host galaxy . from this distribution",
    ", we can check if the observed distance is within the galaxy radius defined in the equation ( [ rr ] ) . from @xmath85 grbs with both redshift and host associate , we select @xmath86 long grbs , including only grbs with sure host galaxy types and r - band magnitudes . figure  [ ra_dec ] shows the displacement between ra / dec of the grb s position and the host galaxy counterpart in the sample ( see table c1 of the appendix ) .",
    "most grbs with reliable host measurements have a separation smaller than @xmath87 from the center of their counterpart .",
    "our comparison is in agreement with previous works @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ compa ] , we compare the galaxy radius defined by equation ( [ rr ] ) and the observed distance between grbs from the center of their host galaxies . since all of the observed grbs fall in the defined galaxy radius , equation ( [ rr ] ) provides a reasonable estimate for galaxy radii and a scale measuring the association of grbs and their hosts .",
    "the probability calculated with the galaxy radius that we have defined would lead to a reasonable estimate on the probability for a grb to be coincident with a galaxy on the sky .    in practice people often identify association of a grb with a galaxy by requiring that the projected distance from a grb to the center of a galaxy on the sky is smaller than a critical angular distance , say @xmath88 .",
    "then the probability for chance coincidence of a grb and a galaxy on the sky is calculated by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the solid angle corresponding to a circle of radius @xmath87 . the probability calculated with this formula",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ probvvds ] with a dashed curve .",
    "it appears that the probability calculated with an angular radius @xmath91 is higher than that calculated with a linear radius @xmath92 .",
    "this is caused by the fact that for a fixed angular radius the corresponding linear radius increases with distance while the luminous @xmath92 decreases with redshift .",
    "our results indicate that identifying the grb - galaxy association with a linear distance scale is more reliable than with an angular scale from the galaxy center .",
    "we have calculated the probability for a grb to be coincident with a galaxy on the sky , using the luminosity function and the radius - luminosity relation derived from the sdss and vvds surveys .",
    "since there is not a reliable luminosity function available to higher redshifts , the probability is calculated only up to a redshift @xmath93 ( fig .",
    "[ probvvds ] ) .",
    "the results are in agreement with that of @xcite and @xcite which were obtained with different approaches .",
    "the total probability at @xmath44 is a few percent .",
    "we have also calculated the probability of chance coincidence with a criterion that a grb is considered to be associated with a galaxy if the distance from the grb to the galaxy center is smaller than @xmath91 ( fig .",
    "[ probvvds ] , dashed line ) .",
    "this probability is larger than that calculated with @xmath92 for @xmath94 ( fig .",
    "[ probvvds ] , solid line ) , caused by the fact that for a fixed angular separation the corresponding linear separation increases with @xmath11 and @xmath92 decreases with @xmath11 .",
    "although the chance probability is small , it warns us that identifying a grb host based only on the superposition of a grb with a galaxy on the sky is dangerous .",
    "so far about 350 grbs have been detected by _",
    "swift _ , our results imply that several chance coincidence of a grb with a galaxy might have already happened . as a result , some grb hosts that have been found might be superficial",
    ". however , for the case of grb 060614 , calculation of the chance superposition of it and a @xmath1 galaxy with separation @xmath95 leads to a probability @xmath96 , consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "this small probability indicates that the association of grb 060614 and its host is secure .",
    "obviously , a secure identification of a grb s host would be obtained by ( 1 ) the superposition of the grb with a galaxy ; and ( 2 ) the afterglow of the grb and the host candidate give rise to the same measured redshift .",
    "we have also calculated the probability directly from the data of sdss , following the approach of cobb et al .",
    "the results are presented in appendixes a , which agree with our analytical results .",
    "we thank r. narayan and r. sunyaev for valuable comments and suggestions , e. zucca for providing the k - corrections for the vvds survey , and an anonymous referee for a very enlightening report .",
