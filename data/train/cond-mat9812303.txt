    "in systems of correlated fermions on a lattice some interesting and also puzzling physics seems to happen when interaction  induced localization tendencies , antiferromagnetic , and superconducting fluctuations get mixed .",
    "the standard example of such a system are the copper  oxide superconductors .",
    "@xcite in the underdoped regime , between the af and sc phases , correlations of both af and sc type are strongly enhanced , and a pseudogap is visible in the one particle spectrum and in the spin response functions .",
    "the pseudogap regime is limited from above by a crossover temperature @xmath4 , a monotonously decreasing function of doping . at the temperatures",
    "@xmath5 the underdoped materials are `` strange metals '' : many physical properties are unlike those of a standard fermi liquid@xcite . in the overdoped regime @xmath4",
    "merges with the critical temperature for superconductivity and the regime @xmath6 is merely a fermi liquid .",
    "another interesting feature of the phase diagram is the unusual form of the order parameter . after a rather long period of controversies",
    "the @xmath1symmetry is finally generally accepted.@xcite this is one of the reasons to believe that the pairing mechanisms are tightly related to the antiferromagnetic tendencies and not to the standard phonon  exchange mechanisms .",
    "the @xmath1form of the superconducting correlations subsists also in the pseudogap regime as is seen in recent angle  resolved photoemission @xcite and tunneling @xcite experiments .",
    "the simultaneous existence of strong af correlations , as seen by nmr @xcite or neutron ",
    "scattering @xcite experiments , and even localization tendencies as flattening of the band@xcite make us conclude that the interpretation of this regime only terms of superconducting or antiferromagnetic fluctuations only is not sufficient , especially because we expect that they are coupled .",
    "it is striking that some other apparently completely different systems of correlated fermions have very similar properties .",
    "a phase diagram with the superconducting phase in the vicinity of the spin density wave ( i.e. antiferromagnetic ) instability characterizes also the quasi ",
    "one  dimensional bechgaard salts @xcite and the quasi  two  dimensional organic superconductors of the et family,@xcite where instead of doping the relevant parameter for the phase diagram is pressure .",
    "however the common feature of all these compounds is that they are systems of correlated fermions with reduced dimensionality @xmath7 and with strongly anisotropic and more or less nested fermi surfaces .",
    "the main points for the understanding of the three groups of compounds are : ( i ) the destruction of the nesting by doping ( cuprates ) or by applying pressure ( bechgaard salts and et ) ; ( ii ) the suppression of the umklapp processes by doping the the half - filled band ( in the cuprates and et - s ) or by making the half ",
    "filled band effectively quarter  filled through the breaking the longitudinal dimerization by pressure ( in the bechgaard salts ) .",
    "concerning the bechgaard salts it is interesting to remark that some very recent interpretations of the phase diagram of the @xmath8 material @xcite suggest that the intermediate regime between the high  temperature 1d behavior and the low temperature 3d physics is a strange 2d  liquid with properties very similar to those of the underdoped cuprates above the crossover temperature @xmath3 .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "it is certainly interesting to construct a theory able to treat on the same footing antiferromagnetic and superconducting tendencies in more than one dimension and to follow how the result changes with some external parameter that destroys nesting and the mott  like localization .",
    "the first question one can ask is whether a purely repulsive model like for example the hubbard model ( or some generalization of it ) contains the coexisting and inter  depending antiferromagnetic and superconducting correlations .",
    "in such a model the antiferromagnetic fluctuations are associated with the enhancement of the particle  hole ( p - h ) propagators at low energies and the superconducting tendencies appear through particle  particle ( p - p ) propagators .",
    "the hubbard model is appropriate because at half filling already a simple mean  field calculation gives an antiferromagnetic instability at a finite temperature .",
    "however if one tries to include also the p - p processes already in the weak coupling limit the problem becomes nontrivial already in the weak coupling limit : a simple mean ",
    "field theory is not able to follow both p - h and p - p correlation channels .",
    "one can of course try to remedy this problem by including summation of selected subseries of higher  order diagrams .",
    "one such attempt was to calculate the effective cooper amplitude as a sum of bubble and ladder rpa series@xcite .",
    "the resulting cooper amplitude is then used as coupling constant for assumed effective bcs theory .",
    "this procedure thus explicitely decouples three diferent summations ( rpa bubbles , rpa ladder , and bcs ladder ) without real justification .",
    "the flex ( conserving ) calculations @xcite based on the similar simplifications are also prejudiced by the choice of diagrams to be summed .",
    "the only way to proceed systematically is to construct the renormalization group that takes into account all p - p and p - h loops of a given order ( or to use the equivalent parquet approach ) . in ( quasi ) one dimension the renormalization group has been successfully used and is one of the basic theoretical ingredients in the physics of low  dimensional metals @xcite .    in two dimensions",
    "only a limited number of simplified cases was solved by the renormalization group .",
    "the poor man s scaling applied only to the interactions between electrons placed at the van hove points it gives an antiferromagnetic instability at half - filling and superconductivity of @xmath1 symmetry if the deviation of the chemical potential @xmath9 from its value at half - filling becomes of the order of critical temperature of the antiferromagnetic state.@xcite the equivalent parquet approach has been used for half - filling ( but without the limitation to the van hove points ) and also finds an antiferromagnetic instablity.@xcite parquet calculations for simple flat fermi surfaces @xcite give an antiferromagnetic instability but can not provide a continuous phase diagram as function of some imperfect nesting parameter or band filling : the @xmath1like superconducting pole appears simply by cutting the p - h part of the flow , as in ref .. the scaling approach to a system with a fermi surface with both flat and curved parts",
    "@xcite has also reported a superconducting instability in a purely repulsive model , together with deviations from fermi liquid behavior .",
    "however , the complete one  loop renormalization group ( or parquet ) for the real _ band _ of electrons with imperfect and tunable nesting , or doping , still remains unresolved .",
    "the main difficulty is related to the correct treatment of the coupling between p - p and p - h channels .",
    "different authors have tried to avoid to take into account the coupling between the different renormalization channels making drastic simplifications or limiting themselves to some particular forms of the fermi surfaces or only to the low energy effective action . in our former publications @xcite",
    "we have shown that in the hubbard model one can treat the p - h channel perturbatively if the filling is sufficiently far from one half .",
    "then the renormalization group gives only a weak kohn ",
    "luttinger like pairing .",
    "the p - p part of the flow is decoupled from the p - h one in the low energy regime for the simple reason that the p - h part is negligible there .",
    "other calculations based on the perturbative treatment of the p - h channel were also reported.@xcite if the fermi surface is well ( but imperfectly ) nested , and this is exactly the interesting regime , this strategy does not work any more because both p - p and p - h loops are non  perturbatively large , even for weak interactions . in the case of the square fermi surface ( with or without the van hove singularities )",
    "taking only the leading logarithmic part the coupling between the channels into account@xcite is equally insufficient .",
    "another way to proceed is to see the 2d hubbard system as an ensemble of coupled chains:@xcite this approach gives a phase diagram with superconductivity formed by pairs of electrons on different chains , giving rise to a spatially anisotropic version of an @xmath10-wave order parameter . among the number of the theoretical approaches to the hubbard model other then via the loop ",
    "summations the monte carlo calculations take in principle `` everything '' into account but it is still unclear whether they give @xcite or not @xcite the superconductivity .    in the present paper we search to reliably determine the phase diagram of the hubbard model in the vicinity of half  filling where p - h processes are non  perturbatively enhanced and at least nearly as important as p - p ones .",
    "we also detect the dominant components of the angle  resolved correlation functions for antiferromagnetism and superconductivity as function of temperature .",
    "this allows us to know the symmetry of the microscopic fields whose fluctuations become important .",
    "the method that we will use is a generalization of shankar s renormalization ",
    "group approach @xcite to an arbitrary form of the fermi surface .",
    "in particular , the kadanoff ",
    "wilson mode elimination ( developed by shankar for 2d fermions ) applied to the effective action with only two ",
    "particles interaction keeps only the strictly logarithmic contributions to the flow .",
    "thus even if the nesting is very good but not perfect the p - h part of the flow would be zero because the logarithmic singularity is destroyed by imperfect nesting . to keep the p - h part of the flow finite even in the case of imperfect nesting we start by formulating the _ exact _ kadanoff  wilson  polchinski renormalization group for fermions on a lattice .",
    "it was formulated previously @xcite only for the quantum fields with _",
    "one _ zero  energy point in the momentum space , like the @xmath11 field theory ( critical phenomena ) . in many ",
    "fermions system in more than one dimension we have on the contrary the whole fermi surface that plays the role of the zero energy manifold , what makes the calculations more complicated . starting with the full bandwidth as the initial energy cutoff we perform iterative mode elimination reducing the cutoff @xmath12 around the fermi surface .",
    "collecting at each step of the renormalization all the terms ( cumulants ) of the effective action we obtain the polchinski equation for the vertices of the effective theory at the given step of the renormalization .",
    "it is important that even if the initial interaction was only a four  point function ( two  particle interaction ) vertices of _ all _ higher orders are created by the renormalization procedure .",
    "once the exact renormalization group is formulated we proceed with its truncation at the one  loop level : the one  loop truncation of the flow for the four  point vertex is done by neglecting all renormalization  group  created vertices of order larger than six .",
    "shankar@xcite already has remarked that the six  point function created by the mode elimination is essential to get non",
    " logarithmic contribution to the four point vertex ( the effective interaction ) .",
    "the one - loop renormalization of the interaction that we obtain in this way appears to be generally _ non  local _ in @xmath12 , i.e. the flow of the vertex at a given step of the renormalization depends on the values of the vertex at former steps .",
    "this is certainly not a pleasant but ( as far as we can see ) necessary property of the kwp procedure if we want to keep more than just the purely logarithmic contributions .",
    "we than apply the one  loop kwp renormalization group to the hubbard model .",
    "one further approximation we make is to consider the effective interaction as a function only of the projection of the momenta to the square fermi surface ( marginal interactions ) while the radial dependence and dynamics are neglected because they are irrelevant with respect to the fermi ",
    "liquid scaling.@xcite we neglect also the renormalization of the self  energy .",
    "if we take only marginal interactions into account this is justified at the one  loop level because the renormalization of the weight and of the lifetime of the electrons receives a nonzero contribution only at the two  loop level .",
    "we thus renormalize only the interaction @xmath13 , a function of three angular variables corresponding to the angular parts of the three external momenta , the fourth being determined by momentum conservation .",
    "we allow the @xmath14variables to be anywhere on the almost square fermi surface and not only in the configurations that give perfect nesting or zero center  of  the  mass momentum : these two classes of the configurations would correspond only to the processes with the leading logarithmic renormalization in the p - h and p - p channels , respectively .",
    "as will become clear later , taking all three @xmath14variables without constraints is the essential point of the calculation because the coupling between p - p and p - h channels is appears mostly through interactions that have other than just leading  logarithmic flow .",
    "this is a special feature of the square or almost square fermi surface and can be handled only by the non  local ( outer  shell ) contributions to the flow , using the polchinski equation .",
    "the first aim of our calculation is to find the temperature at which the system flows towards strong coupling .",
    "we associate this temperature with a mean  field like critical temperature and call it @xmath0 . a typical mean ",
    "field theory then is regularized for @xmath15 by adding counterterms that contain fermions bilinearly coupled to some order parameter . in our theory",
    "the order parameter is not known a priory : it is determined by the manner in which the _ function _",
    "@xmath13 diverges at @xmath16 .",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of the behavior of the angle  resolved correlation functions for antiferromagnetism and superconductivity and obtain the type and the symmetry of the order parameter determining the dominant correlations near the @xmath0 .",
    "the final result is the analogue of a mean  field phase diagram of the hubbard model .",
    "we are considering a two  dimensional system where one should be careful about the interpretation of @xmath17 : in the case of magnetism , this indicates the onset of well  defined finite  range correlations . for weak interactions ,",
    "this is typically a very well  defined crossover.@xcite in the case of pairing @xmath0 can be identified with the onset of quasi  long  range order . however , in real systems like copper oxides even a weak inter ",
    "plane two  particle hopping ( particle  hole ",
    "pair hopping for antiferromagnetism or josephson tunneling for superconductivity ) stabilizes a 3d long  range order .    in section",
    "ii we begin by the formulation of the many fermion system on a lattice in terms of functional integrals .",
    "we introduce the concept of the effective action and show how it can be formally calculated using the partial trace technique .",
    "we than derive the kadanoff  wilson ",
    "polchinski exact renormalization group as one possible strategy for calculating the effective action in terms of the renormalization group flow of all vertices .",
    "truncating the effective action at the level of sixth order vertices we obtain the one loop renormalization group equations for the effective interaction and for the selfenergy . in section iii",
    "we apply the zero  temperature one  loop renormalization group to the hubbard model on a square lattice .",
    "we derive the flow equations for the effective interaction function and for the angle  resolved correlation functions of superconducting and antiferromagnetic type .",
    "after discretization of the angle @xmath14 on the fermi surface we integrate numerically the flow and present the resulting phase diagram . in section",
    "iv we introduce finite temperature explicitly in the renormalization group equations .",
    "we then calculate the fixed point values of the correlation functions at temperatures near the instability .",
    "the conclusions are given in section v.",
    "the simplest model for interacting fermions on a two  dimensional square lattice is the hubbard hamiltonian @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron at the site @xmath20 with spin @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the inter - site transfer integral , @xmath9 is the chemical potential , and @xmath23 is the on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "after fourier transform , the hamiltonian writes @xmath24 where @xmath25 and the momenta are within the first brillouin zone . in this section",
    "we want to derive the renormalization group for a more general problem . for that purpose",
    "we allow @xmath26 to have a general dependence on @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , we suppose that the interaction can be nonlocal and dynamical , that is , we suppose that it depends on energies and momenta of the interacting particles .",
    "the statistical mechanics of souch general model is given by the partition function @xcite @xmath28 where the functional integration is over grassmann variables @xmath29 for all electrons in the brillouin zone .",
    "the action s is given by @xmath30 @xmath31 the variables @xmath29 are labeled by the energy  momentum vector @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath26 is the bare spectrum measured from the fermi level : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the band dispersion and @xmath9 the chemical potential .",
    "the energies and momenta are conserved so that @xmath35",
    ". @xmath36 is the most general spin independent interaction , a function of the frequencies and momenta .",
    "the derivation of the action ( [ act ] ) for a general model is equivalent to the derivation for the hubbard model @xcite , provided that we put @xmath36 instead of the constant @xmath23 and keep @xmath26 general .",
    "we want to derive the low energy effective action ( leea ) for this model .",
    "the low energy modes are the electronic degrees of freedom close to the fermi surface .",
    "we will use this criterion and use the energy variable @xmath37 to discriminate fast ( high  energy ) modes @xmath38 from the slow ( low  energy ) ones @xmath39 .",
    "let s choose some arbitrary nonzero high energy cutoff @xmath12 defining a shell of wavevectors around the fermi surface .",
    "the electronic variables can then be written @xmath40 the slow modes are inside the shell @xmath41 while the fast ones are outside , with @xmath42 going up to the physical cutoff @xmath43 taken to be equal to the bandwidth so that we are sure that the whole brillouin zone is taken into account .",
    "note that the cutoff is imposed only on momentum space , while the matsubara frequencies remain unlimited .",
    "the leea @xmath44 is an action containing only slow modes and gives the same partition function as @xmath45 eq.([act ] ) , or formally @xmath46 this means that @xmath44 is calculated by taking the _ partial trace _ over only fast modes in eq.([partfunct ] ) : @xmath47 the leea contains a new effective kinetic part @xmath48 with a finite selfenergy term and a new interaction @xmath49 .",
    "we have _ chosen _ that the fermi surface for the bare electrons plays the role of the zero energy manifold .",
    "this still does not mean that we make the approximation of a fermi surface unrenormalized by interactions : even if the fermi surface of the leea is different from the bare one we are still allowed to use @xmath37 for the bookkeeping of our mode elimination .",
    "if we consider the slow modes as parameters , expression ( [ leea ] ) can be evaluated , at least formally , using the linked cluster theorem.@xcite the result is composed of three terms : @xmath50 only the interaction part @xmath51 of the action @xmath45 can mix slow and fast modes : @xmath52 while @xmath53 is diagonal and can contain only one kind of modes in the same term : @xmath54    the first term in the equation ( [ leea1 ] ) is then only a constant from the point of view of the fast electrons and is equal to @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56 is the grand potential ( times @xmath57 ) of the fast electrons as if they were decoupled from the slow ones : @xmath58 this term gives only a shift of the total free energy of the system .",
    "the term @xmath59 in eq.([leea1 ] ) is the most interesting one .",
    "it brings the corrections due to the scattering processes of the slow modes on the fast ones into the leea and is given by the sum of all connected graphs composed of @xmath60 .",
    "if we draw the slow modes as external legs , the diagrams for @xmath61 are the clusters with at least two legs .",
    "a few low order diagrams for @xmath59 are given in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the terms with two external legs , labeled by @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath10 in figure [ fig1 ] are the selfenergy terms , renormalizing @xmath53 .",
    "the terms with four legs : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 renormalize the quartic interaction term @xmath51 . the terms with six ( @xmath20 and @xmath69 ) and more legs are new",
    "! they are _ created _ by the mode elimination procedure .",
    "of physical interest is the leea for the electrons in the very vicinity of the fermi surface ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "even if the coupling is small some of the loop diagrams will attain at low temperature @xmath71 large values depending of the form of the fermi surface .",
    "for example , if the fermi surface is not close to van hove singularities the particle  particle ( p - p ) diagram ( @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) for the four  point vertex with zero center of the mass momentum always has a logarithmic dependence like @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the initial cutoff equal to the bandwidth .",
    "if the fermi surface is nested the particle  hole ( p - h ) diagram ( @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) at @xmath74 behaves in the same way . in the hubbard model close to half  filling the van hove singularities make both loops squares of logarithms .",
    "the perturbative calculation of the expansion ( [ omega ] ) for small @xmath23 is thus not straightforward : at least some of sets of diagrams , containing _ both p  p and p  h subdiagrams _ , have to be summed entirely .",
    "the lowest order diagram of that kind is the one denoted by @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . on the other hand",
    "the truncation of the leea at fourth order is in general allowed for weak coupling .",
    "however the direct summation of cumulants for @xmath59 ( like t - matrix or rpa summation ) can be performed in a useful and controlled way only for a limited number of physical problems , that is when some subsets of diagrams are dominant .",
    "the direct parquet summation for a general fermi surface in more than one dimensions is probably very hard .",
    "it has been done only for the case of perfectly nested ( flat ) fermi surface @xcite .",
    "the problem is even more difficult if the coupling is not small .",
    "then the criteria of most important sets of diagrams are not clear any more and even the truncation of leea at quartic or sextic term in @xmath39 is not justified any more .      a tractable way to construct the _ exact _",
    "leea is to use the kadanoff ",
    "wilson  polchinski renormalization group .",
    "let us call the initial cutoff ( the bandwidth ) @xmath75 and parameterize @xmath76 by the renormalization parameter @xmath77 so that @xmath78 .",
    "the idea of the renormalization group is to consider the transformation @xmath79 as an infinite set of infinitesimal mode eliminations @xmath80 at each step we eliminate @xmath81 of modes at a distance @xmath12 from both sides of the fermi surface .",
    "we will see that the mode elimination of an infinitesimal shell of degrees of freedom is much simpler than the one  step procedure discussed in the previous section .    from now on we will call the leea simply the effective action because in the process of successive mode elimination ( [ successive ] )",
    "@xmath76 can have any value between @xmath75 and zero .",

    "but if we are in two or more dimensions and especially if the nesting is good but not perfect , it is better to consider the exactly logarithmic configurations of energy - momentum as exceptions . if we formulate the flow equations correctly for the general case , the exact logarithmic terms will also appear , as we will see in the next subsection .    in principle vertices of all orders",
    "are created with increasing powers of the initial coupling @xmath23 : it is easy to see that the vertex @xmath119 , @xmath120 , is created by the tree term of the polchinski equation with power @xmath121 of the bare coupling .",
    "this means that the truncation of the expansion ( [ action - noeuds ] ) is equivalent to weak ",
    "coupling perturbation theory .",

    "this is consistent with the weak  coupling treatment because off  diagonal terms would imply the existence of some form of long  range order , which is out of the reach of the present calculation .",
    "all we can possible expect from our calculation is a divergence of some effective interaction signaling the _ onset _ of long  range order .",

    "it is thus consistent to neglect selfenergy corrections .",
    "this is what we do in the subsequent one  loop renormalization of the hubbard model .",

    "if we neglect the selfenergy corrections , the flow of the effective interaction is completely determined by the expressions ( [ beta.fctn]-[pi ] ) with the bare propagators instead of the renormalized ones : @xmath217 the effective interaction is a function of three energy - momenta .",

    "this can be seen as parametrization of the interactions as if the electrons were on the fermi surface ( or points in 1d ) with @xmath222 . in two dimensions",
    "the marginal interactions depend only on polar coordinates of the wave vectors . only the interactions between electrons at the fermi surface are then kept and , if the fermi surface is not nested , one gets the leea for the fermi liquid . @xcite .",

    "we have analyzed in detail this problem in a former article.@xcite    let us now concentrate on the square fermi surface , for the half filled hubbard model .",
    "the processes between electrons on the fermi surface are now labeled with three variables instead of two as in the case of the fermi surface without nesting : if we put particles 1 , 2 and 3 _ anywhere _ on one side or on two opposite sides of the square , the fourth falls exactly on the square as well .",
    "this is due to the perfect flatness of the fermi surface and to the marginality of the umklapp processes .",
    "a few examples of marginal interactions between the electrons on the square are shown on figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "the interaction depends only on the positions of the particles on the square .",
    "the `` angle '' @xmath14 can be defined in a way shown on figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "it is important to notice that even if the filling is not exactly one  half ( and the fermi surface not exactly square ) , all above interactions will still be important , as long as the effective phase space is open i.e. when @xmath227 ( as on figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "we thus take as marginal all effective interactions viewed as functions of three angles @xmath14 of the particles : @xmath228 when the cutoff becomes smaller than the chemical potential , we are back to the non nested case , in which the functions @xmath225 and @xmath226 are the marginal interactions .",

    "we will now derive the flow equation for @xmath230 at zero temperature . the pleasant aspect of the kadanoff  wilson ",
    "polchinski mode elimination technique at @xmath231 is that @xmath12 can then be interpreted as the temperature .",
    "namely , the interaction at some temperature @xmath232 is renormalized mainly by virtual processes involving `` quantum '' electrons , those with energy larger than @xmath232 , having almost the distribution of the @xmath231 electrons .",
    "this is exactly what we do with the renormalization group : only modes with @xmath233 are involved in the virtual processes renormalizing @xmath123 .",

    "we see that in our formalism they are taken into account on equal footing with all other scattering processes , with any values of @xmath240 and @xmath160 , as illustratd on figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "the processes with the leading logarithmic renormalization in one channel and with less strong but still important flow in the other channel ( as the processes in figures [ fig6](d ) and ( e ) ) are the processes which couple strongly both renormalization channels .",

    "it is constructed from all iterations of five basic loop diagrams from figure [ fig4](c ) .",
    "a few lowest order parquet diagrams are shown on figure [ fig8 ] .    an important aspect of the non half filled hubbard model is that it can not be solved by a scale invariant renormalization group .",
    "the finite chemical potential determines the intrinsic scale , the physical interpretation of which is the crossover between two different renormalization regimes .",
    "the crossover can be seen from the _ explicit _ scale dependence of p - p and p - h differential loops @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "we can define the quantities @xmath245 @xmath246 they measure respectively the dominant parts of p - p and p - h renormalization tendencies .",

    "we call the first regime the parquet regime because both loops are important . the second regime ,",
    "in which only the cooper channel flows , we call bcs regime . the topology of the effective phase space in the parquet regime is open ( see figure [ fig7 ] ) and , in bcs regime , the phase space is a regular closed ring around the fermi surface , as on figure [ fig5 ] .",

    "approaching this point , some of the coupling constants increase and diverge , while some decrease and , after changing their sign , diverge to @xmath347 .",

    "indeed , all coupling constants obeying only cooper condition @xmath350 and without logarithmic flow in p - h channel diverge to @xmath347 .",
    "this is what we expected since the p - p channel `` pushes '' interactions downwards in a repulsive model .",

    "furthermore the symmetry of the correlation functions is also brought only by the symmetry of the effective interactions .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that the dominant eigenvalue of the correlation function is driven mostly by the dominant attractive ( negative ) eigenvalue of the corresponding effective interaction . from the renormalization of the interaction ( the set of coupling constants )",
    "we can deduce the flow of the effective interactions @xmath372 and @xmath369 as given by equations ( [ v - marginal1 ] ) and ( [ vsdw ] ) .",

    "the price to pay is that for each temperature we have to integrate the complete flow all the way from @xmath409 to @xmath371 and to follow how the result changes with the temperature .",
    "the flow of the dominant eigenvalues of @xmath466 and @xmath469 at a few different values of the temperature is shown on figure [ fig17 ] for three different values of the chemical potential .",
    "both correlation functions are always enhanced with respect to their bare @xmath413 values .",
    "the temperature dependence of the fixed point correlation functions is shown on figure [ fig18 ] .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath0 found by the finite temperature method is practically the same as the one found by the zero  temperature calculations , but now we are able to follow explicitly the enhancement of the correlations of both types in the vicinity of the instability .",
    "it is clearly visible how the doping favors superconductivity and how the divergence of @xmath470 is completely suppressed if the instability is in the bcs regime , i.e. if @xmath471 .",
    "this result justifies the phase diagram on figure [ fig15 ] .    in the low  doping regime ,",
    "both correlations are strongly enhanced and the low  temperature phase can be in principle a mixture of both ( quasi-)long  range  orders , with the superconducting component falling to zero at half filling .",
    "the instability is in the parquet regime : the critical fluctuations are a mixture of two fluctuating channels and can not be treated by an effective mean  field theory like bcs or rpa . in other words ,",
    "the parquet regime is deeply non migdalian so that the vertex corrections are as important as the p - p loops .",
    "the vertex corrections can not be seen as small any more but have to be taken at all orders , just as the p - p diagrams , and together with other p - h loops .",
    "the situation is less complicated in the bcs regime . there",
    ", a low energy effective action can be constructed so that only the p - p diagrams contribute to the instability while the p - h parts ( antiferromagnetic tendencies ) are irrelevant .",
    "the attractive d - wave component of the cooper amplitude in the leea is due to the higher energies ( @xmath472 ) where the p - h diagrams are important . in the bcs regime",
    "only superconductivity is possible as a low  temperature order .",
    "as we are considering a two  dimensional system , one should be careful about the interpretation of @xmath17 : in the case of magnetism , this indicates the onset of well  defined finite  range correlations . for weak interactions ,",
    "this is typically a very well  defined crossover.@xcite in the case of pairing @xmath0 can be identified with the onset of quasi ",
    "long  range order .",
    "furthermore , the line between @xmath473 and @xmath474 phases on figure [ fig15 ] is only partially determined in our calculations : we only know that at temperature near @xmath0 , this line is close to the crossover line @xmath475 , but at lower temperatures we can not say anything about its position .",
    "it is difficult to discuss the experimental results from the point of view of our phase diagram .",
    "first of all , the one  loop renormalization ",
    "group is a weak coupling perturbative method while the interactions in the copper  oxide superconductors are moderate  to  strong .",
    "for that reason our phase diagram can be compared to the experiments only qualitatively .",
    "furthermore , in our calculations we have neglected self - energy corrections , which are in polchinski s formalism given by hartree  fock  like terms with renormalized @xmath221 and * q*dependent vertices",
    ". [ alpha.fctn ] ) . the broadening and redistribution of the spectral weight of the quasiparticles",
    "is then determined by the dynamics of the vertex , which is irrelevant and is therefore neglected .",
    "one should however notice that at the two  loop level self ",
    "energy effects become important , as known from the one  dimensional case.@xcite in that sense , our @xmath0 should be understood as a temperature where the effects of interactions start to change strongly not only the two  particles correlations , but the single particle properties as well .",
    "for that reason it seems natural to associate the temperature @xmath0 to the crossover temperature @xmath3 found in the cuprates .",
    "the parquet regime would then correspond roughly to the under - doped situation and the bcs regime to the over - doped regime .",
    "the `` phase '' @xmath473 corresponds then to the antiferromagnetism and to the pseudo - gap regime : the antiferromagnetic correlations and the localization tendencies are there accompanied more and more with the superconducting correlations as we approach the crossover line @xmath475 .",
    "we expect that the critical temperature for antiferromagnetism and for superconductivity in this regime is lower than @xmath0 because of the self  energy corrections .",
    "in other words , at temperature @xmath0 in the parquet regime , the local antiferromagnetic moments and d  wave singlets are created with finite correlation lengths .",
    "this gives rise to the pseudogap in both spin and charge responses , together with the precursors of both antiferromagnetism and d  wave superconductivity .",
    "the long  range  order between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism is perhaps absent due to the fact that both types of fluctuations are strong .",
    "that is the central idea of the so(5 ) models @xcite for the high-@xmath17 superconductivity . in that language",
    "our @xmath0 would play the role of the mean  field critical temperature .    in the bcs regime",
    "only the superconducting fluctuations are critical .",
    "we associate thus the phase @xmath476 to the overdoped regime . from large n arguments@xcite we know that the self  energy corrections disappear as @xmath477 if the fermi surface is not nested .",
    "this is the case in the bcs regime where the nesting processes are irrelevant .",
    "consequently , the critical temperature in this regime is well approximated by @xmath0 .",
    "this is in agreement with the experiments : in the overdoped regime the crossover temperature @xmath3 is equal to the critical temperature for the superconductivity .",
    "finally , mean - field arguments@xcite suggest that one expects an incommensurate sdw ( icsdw ) only in the bcs regime and only where the imperfect nesting is still strong , i.e. not far from the crossover @xmath475 .",
    "however , the precision of our calculation ( we cut the brillouin zone into up to 32 @xmath14-patches ) is not sufficient to check whether a magnetic correlation function diverges at some incommensurate wave vector . in any case , the incommensurate sdw and d - superconductivity are not in competition because they appear at different places on the fermi surface : scd in the corners and icsdw on the flat parts ; one thus expects their coexistence .",
    "altogether , the phase diagram on figure [ fig15 ] has important similarities to the experimental phase diagrams . the one  loop renormalization  group , taking into account electron  electron and electron ",
    "hole processes on the same footing reveals the essence of the physics of a doped half filled band of correlated electrons .",
    "important comments of p. nozires are acknowledged .",

    "the most general spin  rotation invariant interaction term can be written in several ways .",
    "one way is in terms of charge  charge and spin  spin interactions @xmath479 where @xmath359 et @xmath480 are @xmath481 the summation over all three energy ",

    "rotation invariance allows us to write the interaction part of the action as a sum of the singlet @xmath488 and triplet @xmath489 parts : @xmath490 where @xmath2 and @xmath491 are the variables of annihilation of the singlet and triplet states @xmath492 @xmath493 all coupling functions in the equations ( [ csoper],[par - anipar],[singtrip ] ) possess the symmetry related to momentum  exchange and time  inversion .",
    "if @xmath494 is a coupling function two exchange operators can be defined as @xmath495 and @xmath496 the time inversion operator @xmath182 is @xmath497 the symmetries of the coupling function are the time inversion symmetry @xmath498 and the exchange symmetry @xmath499 both symmetries can be easily checked for the coupling functions in expression ( [ par - anipar ] ) .",
    "we will see that all other couplings can be derived from @xmath500 only and have the same symmetry properties upon @xmath177 and @xmath501 operations .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath502 if @xmath503 : exchanging particles 1 and 2 or particles 3 and 4 are exchanged is equivalent .",
    "we want now to find the relations between the six coupling functions in equations ( [ csoper],[par - anipar],[singtrip ] ) . using the pauli principle",
    "one gets @xmath504 @xmath505 let s suppose @xmath381 and @xmath290 to be two independent functions .",
    "we can write them in the form @xmath506 @xmath507 if we now _ choose _ @xmath508 it follows from ( [ trafo2 ] ) that @xmath509 .",
    "it means that the most general interaction can be written in terms of a single function @xmath500 , without losing generality .",
    "the function @xmath510 is also contained in @xmath500 .",
    "namely , from two equal - spin electrons one can build only a triplet state ( antisymmetric under @xmath177 ) so that @xmath511 while @xmath512 containing the singlet and the triplet interactions . @xmath513 and @xmath514 can be seen as the antisymmetric and symmetric parts of the same function .",
    "this function is simply @xmath515 .",
