    "in recent decades , the problem of decomposing a metric space into low - diameter subspaces has become a key step in the solution for many problems , including metric embeddings ( e.g. @xcite ) , distance oracles and routing schemes design ( e.g. @xcite ) , graph sparsification ( e.g. @xcite ) and optimization problems , such as multicommodity cuts @xcite , @xmath7-extension @xcite and the traveling salesman problem @xcite .    following the recent literature , we focus on _ randomized _ decompositions , which loosely speaking refers to a probability distribution over partitions of a metric space into sets ( called clusters ) of low diameter , such that nearby points are more likely to be `` clustered '' together .",
