    "the major epoch of star formation in galaxies is one of the most important topics in modern astrophysics , because it is significantly related to the formation of galaxies and quasars as well as to cosmology .",
    "massive stars formed in the first episode of star formation have a lifetime of @xmath3 to @xmath4 years and then release type ii supernova ( snii ) products ( primarily the @xmath5-elements such as o , ne , mg , si , etc . , but comparatively little iron ) .",
    "it takes a much longer time for type ia supernovae ( snia ) to release iron .",
    "the different nucleosynthesis yields and timescales of snia s and snii s thus make the abundance ratio [ @xmath5/fe ] a potentially useful cosmological clock with which one can identify the epoch of first star formation in galaxies .",
    "it is therefore important to study chemical properties of high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) objects .",
    "the best objects are , however , not galaxies but quasars .",
    "quasars possess broad emission - line gas in the nuclear region , which is photoionized by the central black hole engine .",
    "it is generally considered that the heavy elements in the broad line regions ( blrs ) come from stars in a host galaxy . therefore , systematic study of chemical properties of blrs of quasars at high redshift is of particular interest ( hamann & ferland 1992 , 1993 ) .",
    "rest - frame optical emission lines , which are usually used to study chemical properties of nearby objects , are redshifted to the near - infrared ( nir ) in these quasars .",
    "recent nir spectroscopy of high-@xmath0 quasars has shown that the rest - frame optical spectra are dominated by singly ionized iron ( feii ) emission as well as hydrogen recombination lines ( hill , thompson , & elston 1993 ; elston , thompson , & hill 1994 ; kawara et al .",
    "1996 ) , suggesting long - lasting star formation in the nuclear regions of the quasar hosts ( @xmath6 gyr ) .",
    "recently kawara et al .",
    "( 1996 ) detected [ oiii]@xmath15007 emission from the high-@xmath0 quasar b1422 + 231 at redshift 3.62 , and showed that the rest - frame uv and optical spectrum is quite similar to the average spectrum of lbqs ( large bright quasar survey ) quasars which are mostly located at @xmath7 1 - 2 ( francis et al .",
    ". however , most high-@xmath0 quasars studied by hill et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and elston et al .",
    "( 1994 ) turn out to be super iron - rich quasars which are not so frequently observed in nearby quasars ( cf .",
    "lpari , terlevich , & macchetto 1993 ) . in order to investigate star formation history of high-@xmath0 quasar hosts , we need more nir spectroscopic observations of high-@xmath0 quasars ( cf .",
    "taniguchi et al . 1996 ) . here",
    ", we report our new nir spectroscopy of a high-@xmath0 quasar pks 1937@xmath2101 , which is a radio - loud quasar with a flat spectrum at a redshift of 3.787 ( bolton , savage , & wright 1979 ; lanzetta et al .",
    "1991 ) . despite of its high redshift ,",
    "its optical apparent magnitude is as bright as @xmath8 = 17.0 mag ( vron - cetty & vron 1996 ) and so the absolute magnitude is @xmath9 mag ( a hubble constant @xmath10 = 100 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , and a deceleration parameter @xmath12 are assumed ) .",
    "the soft x - ray luminosity is also huge , @xmath13 erg s@xmath11 ( brinkmann & siebert 1995 ) .",
    "hence , pks 1937@xmath2101 is one of the most intrinsically luminous quasars ever known .",
    "pks 1937@xmath2101 was observed by using the long - slit cryogenic spectrometer ( crsp : joyce 1995 ) with a @xmath14 insb detector array at the f/15 focus of the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4 meter telescope on 17 may 1995 .",
    "a @xmath15 slit with a scale of 0.36@xmath16 pixel@xmath11 was placed on the intensity peak of the object in the ew direction .",
    "the seeing size was 2.7@xmath16 .",
    "a 200 lines mm@xmath11 grating with a blaze angle of @xmath17 was used in second order at @xmath18 ( @xmath19 m ) , and in first order at @xmath20 ( @xmath21 m ) .",
    "oh airglow lines and henear lamp spectra were used to calibrate the wavelength scale and to measure the spectral resolution .",
    "the accuracy of the wavelength scale calibration is 130 km s@xmath11 at @xmath18 , and 110 km s@xmath11 at @xmath20 .",
    "the typical fwhms of the spectral resolution are 2000 km s@xmath11 at @xmath18 and 2300 km s@xmath11 at @xmath20 .",
    "the object was shifted along the slit by 10 arcsec between exposures .",
    "the redshift of pks 1937@xmath2101 is so high ( @xmath22 ) that the conspicuous rest - frame optical emission lines ( [ oiii]@xmath23 , h@xmath24 , and some feii ) are redshifted beyond 2.3 @xmath25 m .",
    "although the @xmath20-band spectral coverage extends to 2.43 @xmath25 m , the background thermal emission makes it difficult to observe at @xmath26 2.3 @xmath25 m .",
    "we therefore set the unit integration time of @xmath20-band observations as 20 s to avoid the background saturation , and took 120 scans to achieve the total integration time = 2400 s. another interesting emission line mgii@xmath12798 is slightly out of the observable range of @xmath18 band but we made @xmath18-band spectroscopy of pks 1937@xmath2101 to see the ultraviolet feii features as well as the continuum emission .",
    "because the observing time was limited , we took only two 300 s data of @xmath18 band ( the total integration time = 600 s ) .",
    "the data reduction was done using standard techniques ( joyce 1995 ) .",
    "the residual sky emission was removed by fitting the sky emission on adjacent sky pixels . a faint standard star hd 162208 ( a0 ; @xmath18=7.215 and @xmath20= 7.110 )",
    "was used to calibrate the flux scale and to correct for telluric extinction . a 10000 k black - body spectrum , which fits to the @xmath27 magnitudes of the standard star ( elias et al . 1982 ) within 5% deviation , was used for flux scale calibration .",
    "the photometric accuracy is estimated to be 7 % in @xmath18 and 13 % in @xmath20 .",
    "figure 1 shows the observed @xmath18- and @xmath20- band spectra of pks 1937@xmath2101 together with the lbqs composite spectrum of quasars at @xmath28 ( francis et al . 1991 ) .",
    "the expected feii emission features are also shown in the lower panel for reference .",
    "the @xmath20-band spectrum shows [ oiii]@xmath15007 , h@xmath24 , and h@xmath29 ( [ oiii]@xmath14363 possibly overlaps with this line ) .",
    "the emission - line properties are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the h@xmath24 emission seems narrower than those of typical quasars ( see table 1 and figure 2 ) .",
    "the [ oiii]/h@xmath24 ratio is similar to that of lbqs composite quasar spectrum . in figure 2",
    ", we show that the observed @xmath20-band spectrum can be fitted well solely by the emission lines of [ oiii]@xmath14959,5007 , h@xmath24 , h@xmath29 , and the linear continuum .",
    "this fitting gives feii(4434 - 4686)/h@xmath30 nominally , being smaller than that of b1422 + 231 ( kawara et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we also show the comparison of the rest - frame optical spectra between pks 1937@xmath2101 and b1422 + 231 ( kawara et al .",
    "1996 ) in fig .",
    "there can not be seen strong optical feii emission in the pks 1937@xmath2101 spectrum . however , taking account of the poorer s / n of the pks 1937@xmath2101 spectrum , we give a 3@xmath31 upper limit in table 1 where @xmath31 is the root mean square noise of flux in the range between 4434    and 4686  .",
    "the @xmath18-band spectrum shows little evidence for ultraviolet feii emission feature , either . in the red edge of the @xmath18-band spectrum ,",
    "a blue part of mgii@xmath12798 emission can be seen although we can not estimate anything about this line .",
    "given the photometric accuracy of our @xmath18- and @xmath20-band spectra , the difference of fluxes in the @xmath18 band between ours and the lbqs composite spectrum may well be real .",
    "in fact , we can fit the continuum emission with a power law of @xmath32 ( see figure 1 ) , which is almost consistent with the average continuum spectrum of quasars , where the power - law index ranges from @xmath33 ( francis et al .",
    "1991 ) to @xmath34 ( sargent et al .",
    "the ultraviolet spectra of most quasars , regardless of radio loudness ( bergeron & kunth 1984 ) , are dominated by the feii features as well as the power - law continuum emission .",
    "therefore , the lower flux and the featureless property of the @xmath18 band spectrum may provide evidence against the presence of ultraviolet feii emission features in pks 1937@xmath2101 .",
    "we therefore conclude that pks 1937@xmath2101 does not belong to a class of super iron - rich high-@xmath0 quasars quasars studied by elston et al .",
    "( 1994 ) has shown that s4 0680 + 68 at redshift 3.2 does not belong to this class ( taniguchi et al .",
    "1996 ; murayama et al .",
    "reported by elston et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "our nir spectroscopy has shown that pks 1937@xmath2101 is the most distant quasar with [ oiii ] emission but little feii emission . here",
    "we discuss the nature of high-@xmath0 quasars in terms of their rest - frame optical spectra .",
    "we give a summary of the recent nir spectroscopy of high-@xmath0 quasars including pks 1937@xmath2101 in table 2 .",
    "there is a tendency that the quasars with @xmath35 show strong feii emission ( hill et al . 1993 ; elston et al .",
    "1994 ) while those with @xmath36 show strong [ oiii ] emission ( kawara et al . 1996 ; this paper ) .",
    "one interesting spectroscopic property known for low-@xmath0 ( @xmath37 ) quasars is the anticorrelation between the strength of optical feii and [ oiii ] emission lines , although its physical mechanism is not fully understood ( boroson & green 1992 ) .",
    "we examine if the high-@xmath0 quasars follow the same anticorrelation . in figure 3",
    ", we show the relationship of the equivalent width ratios between ( [ oiii]@xmath38)/h@xmath24 and feii@xmath14434 - 4684/h@xmath24 .",
    "the low-@xmath0 quasars studied by boroson & green ( 1992 ) show a loose , but statistically significant anticorrelation .",
    "it is also shown that the radio - loud quasars tend to be located in the lower portion of this diagram ( i.e. , weak feii emitters ) .",
    "pks 1937@xmath2101 , b1422 + 231 ( kawara et al .",
    "1996 ) , and the radio - quiet , high-@xmath0 quasars studied by hill et al .",
    "( 1993 ) share the same property as those of low-@xmath0 quasars . on the other hand , the radio - loud quasars studied by elston et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and hill et al .",
    "( 1993 ) do not follow the same trend as low-@xmath0 quasars .",
    "we have shown that pks 1937@xmath2101 and b1422 + 231 are members of the class of objects which share the same optical emission - line properties as those of low-@xmath0 quasars . since the total number of high-@xmath0 quasars discussed here is only eight , we need more observations to understand the general nature of high-@xmath0 quasars .",
    "finally we comment on the epoch of major star formation in the host galaxy of pks 1937@xmath2101 .",
    "the @xmath5 elements , such as o and mg , come from snii s of massive star origin and thus are quickly expelled into the interstellar space after the major episode of star formation ( within a few @xmath3 to 10@xmath39 years ) .",
    "it is considered that the n enrichment is delayed ( @xmath40 years ) because it is partly a secondary element formed by cno cycle in hydrogen - burning shell of intermediate mass stars ( hamann & ferland 1993 ) .",
    "the rest - frame ultraviolet spectra of pks 1937@xmath2101 taken by lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and fang & crotts ( 1995 ) show evidence for nv@xmath11240 emission .",
    "therefore , the nuclear gas has already been polluted with n , implying that the elapsed time from the major star formation is longer than @xmath40 years ( hamann & ferland 1993 ) .",
    "however , our observation suggests that the major fe enrichment has not yet been made in pks 1937@xmath2101 .",
    "if this is the case , our observations provide a constraint on the epoch of major star formation in the host galaxy .",
    "the bulk of iron come from snia s whose progenitors lifetime is very likely to cluster around @xmath41 gyr ( yoshii , tsujimoto , & nomoto 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , the fe enrichment may start at 1.5 gyr after the onset of the first , major star formation in quasar host galaxies . these arguments ,",
    "therefore , specify the epoch of major star formation in pks 1937@xmath2101 ; @xmath40 - 1.5@xmath42 years before redshift 3.787 .",
    "namely , the initial star formation would occur at @xmath43 for @xmath44 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 and @xmath12 , while at @xmath45 for @xmath46 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "recent theoretical prescription on the star formation at high-@xmath0 universe suggests that the major epoch of star formation may occur @xmath47 although subgalactic structures may exist even at @xmath48 ( rees 1996 ; ostriker & gnedin 1996 ) .",
    "provided that the smaller @xmath10 is more preferable , the present observation is consistent with this prescription .",
    "we are very grateful to the staff of kpno and particularly dick joyce for technical support and assistance with the observations .",
    "we also thank a nice lto , dan yacom for his skillful operation of the telescope and picking us to tucson airport just after the observation of pks 1937@xmath2101 .",
    "we would like to thank martin rees for discussion about the galaxy formation at high-@xmath0 universe , fred hamann for both discussion about chemical properties of high-@xmath0 quasars and encouragement , and neil trentham for critical reading the manuscript and useful comments .",
