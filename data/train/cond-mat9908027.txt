    "the phase field is locked to @xmath102 .",

    "the extrapolated critical point for @xmath11 is @xmath192 , which is somewhat larger than the value from previous experimental and numerical studies @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for this discrepancy is as follows .",
    "the width of the plateau near the transition point is given by equation ( [ eq : pla ] ) , and the coefficient in exponential , @xmath55 , is large for @xmath11 .",
    "thus the narrow - plateau - width region ( that is , the small - gap region ) is widely ranged .",
    "this means that it is difficult to estimate the plateau width @xmath193 directly from the numerical calculation and also at finite temperatures .",
    "according to kosterlitz @xcite , the coefficient @xmath55 is described as @xmath194 , and from figure 5 , we see that @xmath195 is small at the transition point for @xmath11 . for the @xmath7 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain corresponding to the large-@xmath10 limit , the gaussian coupling @xmath75 is calculated as @xmath196 ( the compactification radius is @xmath197 ) in reference @xcite , which is slightly larger than the critical value @xmath96 .",
