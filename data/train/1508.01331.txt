    "in modern theoretical cosmology , the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario has been successfully applied to reproduce the observed large - scale structure of the universe ; this indicates that cdm plays an important role in galaxy formation .",
    "studies of galaxy formation based on the cdm scenario have suggested that the collapse of a cdm halo should lead to the capture of baryons by the halo s gravitational potential .",
    "further , the baryonic gases that are currently observable in such galaxies have been influenced by a variety of physical processes in the past , such as star formation , galaxy mergers , and stripping by the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "in particular , the studies of galaxy formation conducted to date have indicated that galactic winds have significantly influenced the history of star formation and the metal enrichment of intergalactic space .",
    "the earliest works on galactic outflows were motivated by observations of the star - forming galaxy m82 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that the ratio of gas to stellar mass in elliptical galaxies is smaller than that in spiral galaxies @xcite ; this gas deficiency in elliptical galaxies indicates that galactic outflows efficiently remove the interstellar gas from these systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , the presence of metals in intergalactic space also suggests that galactic outflows transport metal - containing interstellar media into these regions .",
    "recent observations have revealed that the low - density igm at high redshift contains a small amount of metals @xcite .",
    "thus , results of these observation strongly indicate the importance of galactic outflows in galactic evolution .",
    "however , the mechanism driving these galactic outflows is still unclear .",
    "theoretically , a sufficient energy supply is required for matter to escape from a galactic gravitational potential well @xcite , and the majority of the previous works on galactic outflows have primarily assumed that supernovae ( sne ) and stellar winds function as thermal energy sources for this motion . from a theoretical perspective , however , other possible energy sources driving galactic outflows exist .",
    "for example , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have been suggested as a possible energy source driving galactic outflow @xcite . also , radiation pressure may act as an additional driving force , if the coupling between the dust grains and hot gas is sufficiently strong @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is important for galactic outflows in high-@xmath4 massive star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "cosmic rays can also drive a large - scale outflow , if the coupling between the high - energy particles and thermal gas is sufficiently strong @xcite .",
    "however , while many driving mechanism candidates have been proposed , the majority of the previous theoretical studies have maintained that sne function as the primary source of thermal energy in most star - forming galaxies .",
    "in fact , recent observations have also indicated that a significant number of local active star - forming galaxies form starburst - driven outflows @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic studies have shown that lyman break galaxies at @xmath5 also exhibit galactic outflows @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been found that the outflow velocity is proportional to the star formation rate and the galactic stellar mass in high-@xmath4 galaxies @xcite .",
    "these observations indicate that the bulk of the energy driving outflows is due to sne .    in this study , we intend to focus on transonic solutions as models of galactic outflows driven by thermal energy from sne and stellar winds .",
    "@xcite first examined spherically symmetric solar winds and clarified that they can pass through transonic points smoothly ; this finding demonstrates that both the energy supply and gravity are essential to the transonic acceleration process . as regards physical observation ,",
    "transonic solar wind has been observed in the solar outflow by _",
    "mariner @xmath6 _",
    "@xcite , and the transonic solution is well known as the entropy - maximum solution connecting the starting point ( the sun ) to infinity @xcite .",
    "several studies have argued the existence of transonic galactic outflows by employing parker s solar wind theory . @xcite and @xcite have applied the solar wind model to galactic outflows in the gravitational potential of the stellar halo . @xcite",
    "have calculated the nature of the supersonic region in m82 without considering gravitational potential , but assuming that a transonic point is located 200 pc from the centre . because the dark matter halo ( dmh ) is the dominant component of the gravity source in galaxies",
    ", @xcite has investigated galactic outflows with dmh mass distributions including radiative cooling .",
    "however , transonic solutions were not successfully obtained in that case , because an unrealistic single power - law dmh mass distribution ( @xmath7 ) was assumed .",
    "thus , the validity of the theory of transonic solutions remains an open question .",
    "similar to @xcite , @xcite have studied steady and spherically symmetric transonic galactic outflows in active star - forming galaxies while assuming a fixed transonic point at 200 pc .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , they also considered the influence of the gravitational potential of a cdm halo .",
    "they assumed that the thermal energy was supplied by sne and agn .",
    "as a result , they concluded that sne can drive outflows from dwarf galaxies and that agn are important for driving high - velocity outflows in massive galaxies .",
    "in addition , they advocated that outflows from intermediate galaxies in the quiescent star formation mode can not escape the halo .",
    "the transonic point was fixed in that study ; however , transonic points should be determined naturally based on a balance between the thermal energy supply and the gravitational potential .",
    "further , @xcite discussed the influence of the dmh mass distribution gravitational potential on the nature of transonic galactic outflows while assuming steady , isothermal , and spherically symmetric conditions , without the injection of mass along the outflow lines .",
    "they did not fix the locus of the transonic point and performed more precise analysis .    on the other hand",
    ", a consensus has not yet been reached regarding the functional form of the dmh mass distribution , and several different functions have been proposed by both simulation and observation . for example , on the basis of the cdm scenario , @xcite have concluded that the dmh mass density distribution has a double power - law functional form , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the distance from the galactic centre to the dmh and @xmath10 is the scale radius of the dmh .",
    "this mass density distribution function is called the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) model .",
    "other simulations with higher resolution have also prompted the proposal of double power - law mass density distributions in the cdm scenario , although the power - law index at the centre has differed somewhat .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite have suggested @xmath11 . these mass density distributions , which are based on numerical models , commonly diverge at the centre , in a structure known as a  cusp \" . in contrast , observations of nearby dwarf galaxies have indicated that the dmh mass distributions of these bodies have constant density at their centres ; these structures are referred to as  cores \" .",
    "hence , @xcite has suggested an empirical profile with a core structure such that @xmath12 .",
    "this unsolved problem is known as the  core - cusp problem \" @xcite .    aiming to address this problem",
    ", @xcite adopted a mass distribution functional form of @xmath13 , with a concentration parameter @xmath1 intended to express the variety of the distribution at the centre .",
    "this profile reproduces the nfw profile with @xmath14 well , and approximately reproduces the moore profile with @xmath15 and the burkert profile with @xmath16 , as discussed in section [ model ] .",
    "based on this dmh distribution model , @xcite first reported transonic solutions incorporating the gravitational potential of the dmh .",
    "moreover , they showed the possibility of a new type of transonic solution in which the transonic point forms in a very distant region ( @xmath17 kpc ) .",
    "this transonic solution is slowly accelerated across this wide region .",
    "it is well known that the majority of galaxies have a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at their centres @xcite ; the gravitational potential of this smbh must influence the galactic outflow acceleration process , especially in the central region .",
    "therefore , @xcite added the gravitational potential of the central smbh to the tsuchiya model , because the original tsuchiya model considers the dmh gravitational potential only .",
    "they summarised the variety of transonic solutions under realistic mass distributions incorporating the gravitational potentials of both the dmh and smbh , and applied their model to the sombrero galaxy ( ngc4594 ) to clarify the acceleration process of the galactic outflows .",
    "this galaxy reveals conflicting features @xcite .",
    "specifically , although the trace of the galactic outflow can be seen in x - ray observations , the gas density distribution in this galaxy is well reproduced as a hydrostatic state .",
    "further , @xcite have indicated that the hot gas of this galaxy may form a slowly accelerating transonic outflow . in the widely spread subsonic region , it is difficult to distinguish the gas density from a hydrostatic state .",
    "however , the isothermal approximation adopted by @xcite and @xcite is not universally applicable to galaxies .",
    "for example , the isothermal model results in a larger amount of outflowing gas than can be supplied by sne and stellar winds .",
    "we expect that this discrepancy is due to the breakdown of the isothermal assumption , which causes infinite energy to be supplied to the flow .",
    "therefore , this indicates that a polytropic analysis with a limited total energy is required in order to estimate the mass flux correctly .",
    "moreover , it is widely accepted that the temperature distribution structures of many galaxies are complex .",
    "in fact , it has been confirmed that the observed temperature distributions of some galaxies are not isothermal - like @xcite , i.e. , a temperature gradient exists .    in this paper , we assume a polytropic , steady , and spherically symmetric state for galactic outflows .",
    "the transonic solutions are determined by the gravitational field , total energy , and polytropic index . because we can estimate the outflow acceleration process more realistically by using a polytropic relation than the isothermal approach discussed above , it is possible to examine the influence of outflows on galactic evolution more accurately .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we construct our model in section [ model ] and we summarise the results in section [ results ] . in section [ discussion ] , the differences between the isothermal and polytropic models are discussed , along with the parameter range for actual galaxies .",
    "the conclusions are given in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we construct the theoretical basis of our model . as stated above , we assume a polytropic , steady , spherically symmetric outflow and ignore mass injection along the flow , except at the starting point .",
    "the polytropic relation is @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath0 are the pressure , density , and polytropic index , respectively . @xmath21",
    "indirectly represents the magnitude of the entropy .",

    "( [ eq_polytropic_relation])([eq_energy ] ) , such that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mach number .",
    "hence , by integrating the above equation , we obtain the mach number equation @xmath33 this equation contains @xmath0 , @xmath21 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 as parameters .",

    "this polytropic model reproduces various models developed from both theoretical and observational perspectives with varying degrees of accuracy .",
    "for example , the polytropic model corresponds exactly with the nfw model @xcite for @xmath14 and approximately with the moore model @xcite for @xmath15 and the burkert model @xcite for @xmath16 .",
    "the plausible value of the index @xmath1 remains an open question .",

    "( [ eq_kdmh ] ) and ( [ eq_kbh ] ) .",
    "in figs . [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , we summarise the transonic solution patterns obtained when the gravitational potential of the dmh is incorporated in the model .",
    "we identify two types of transonic solutions : one having only one x - point ( the blue region labelled ` a ' in fig .",

    "when @xmath0 approaches @xmath63 ( the specific heat ratio of monatomic molecule gas ) , the d region expands and the a and b regions contract ( see fig .",

    "we add the gravitational potential of the smbh to that of the dmh in the model .",
    "the dmh potential is widely distributed and dominant over a large region within a given galaxy .",

    "similar to @xcite , we focus on the parameter ranges of slowly accelerating cases in quiescent galaxies . additionally , because many of the previous studies of galactic outflows primarily focused on high - velocity outflows driven by starbursts , we also estimate the parameter ranges of high - velocity outflows in active star - forming galaxies . for the slowly accelerating outflows in quiescent galaxies , we adopt the same assumption as @xcite in order to estimate",

    "in addition , this property is independent of @xmath0 , and the transonic points are not strongly dependent on the dmh mass .",
    "these results indicate that outflows in active star - forming galaxies become supersonic in the inner region , because the supplied energy strongly dominates the gravitational potential energy .        in the isothermal model , the outflow velocity increases without limit .",
    "however , the outflow velocity in actual galaxies is believed to converge to a finite terminal velocity @xmath96 that is dependent on @xmath29 .",
    "we estimate this @xmath96 in the polytropic model as follows . from eq .",
    "( [ eq_mach_number ] ) , we can obtain the velocity equation @xmath97 when @xmath98 and @xmath99 , @xmath100 and the terminal sound speed @xmath101 , or @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath96 is determined by @xmath29 and is independent of @xmath28 , @xmath0 , @xmath21 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the value of @xmath104 is determined by @xmath29 and @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath29 is negative , @xmath96 ( or @xmath104 ) becomes imaginary .",
    "this indicates that the gas can not spread out to infinity .",
    "the range filled by the gas is dependent on @xmath29 and the gravitational potential .",
    "@xcite applied the isothermal model to the sombrero galaxy and estimated the mass flux .",
    "however , the fitted mass flux of @xmath105@xmath106 proposed in that study is unrealistically large compared to the expected supplied gas mass of @xmath107@xmath108 , from sne and stellar winds .",
    "this result obviously conflicts with the assumption of stationarity in that model as , if steady galactic winds exist in this galaxy , the mass flux must be balanced with the supplied gas mass from stars . here , we adopt the proposed polytropic model to resolve this problem . we intend to fit the mass flux to the observed gas density @xcite with a fixed mass flux of @xmath109 .",
    "we use the gravitational potential of the dmh , smbh , and the stars , similar to the approach used to obtain fig .",
    "7 of @xcite .",
    "because the observed temperature distribution is close to that of the isothermal state , we focus on @xmath110 ( corresponding to an assumption of isothermality ) , but we estimate transonic outflows also for large @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath0 increases from 1 , the @xmath29 indicated by the fitting decreases and the transonic points move outward . the transonic solutions with small @xmath0",
    "become b-2 type and the @xmath68 solution originates at the centre , while the solutions with large @xmath0 become b-1 type and the @xmath68 solution does not originate at the centre .",
    "the fitted gas density with @xmath111 has a steeper slope than the observed density , while that with @xmath112 has a shallower slope than the observed result .",
    "hence , we find that the polytropic transonic solution with @xmath113,\\sqrt{e}~[\\mathrm{km } ~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}])=(1.10,0.45,251)$ ] can reproduce the observed gas density well .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the polytropic model improves upon the result provided by the isothermal model well . additionally , although we do not use the observed temperature data to determine @xmath29 , the temperature distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] indicates that the polytropic model can roughly reproduce the observed temperature data with @xmath114 .",
    "this result also indicates that the polytropic model can reproduce observations well .",
    "although the sombrero galaxy is a quiescent galaxy , the possible existence of a slowly accelerating outflow in this galaxy is also shown , as in @xcite .",
    "thus , the outflow from this quiescent galaxy differs from that considered in the majority of the previous studies focusing on outflows from active star - forming galaxies .",
    "the velocity distribution values of the polytropic model are lower than those of the isothermal model , because of the limited energy considered in the former in contrast to the unlimited energy in the latter .",
    "we propose that this low velocity in the inner region ( within @xmath115 kpc ) is due to the absence of energy and mass injection along the flow lines from the stellar components . because mass and energy injection decelerate and accelerate outflows , respectively , the balance between energy and mass injection along the flow lines is important if a plausible velocity distribution in the stellar region ( within several kpc from the centre ) is to be reproduced .",
    "therefore , we will investigate outflows with energy and mass injection along the flow lines in future work .",
    "in addition , we will estimate the velocity distributions of other galaxies using the novel polytropic model proposed in this paper .",
    "next , we focus on velocity distributions in actual galaxies and clarify the influence of @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the dmh mass is @xmath116 and use the gravitational potential indicated in section [ parameters ] . as a result , the smbh mass , @xmath84 , and @xmath10 become approximately @xmath117 , @xmath118 kpc , and @xmath119 kpc , respectively .    to determine the @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_energy ] ) , we assume that the sum of the thermal and kinetic energies at the starting point can be approximated to the supplied energy per unit mass from sne .",
    "the supplied energy per unit mass is the ratio of the energy injection per unit time @xmath120 to the mass injection per unit time @xmath28 ( the mass flux ) . under these assumptions ,",
    "@xmath29 becomes @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the radius of the starting point of the outflow .",
    "if the mass and energy supply are determined by the stellar distribution , the starting point is approximately several times the scale radius of the stellar distribution ( typically several kpc in a @xmath116 galaxy ) . hence , we assume @xmath123 kpc .",
    "we also define @xmath124 where @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 are the star formation rate , the fraction of energy retained after the radiative energy losses , and the energy injection rate from the sne , respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath128 is the return fraction to the interstellar medium . in the kroupa - chevalier initial mass function , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",

    "[ fig8 ] . when @xmath0 and @xmath126 are large , there is only one transonic solution ( type a-1 ) .",
    "thus , in this parameter region , the transonic outflows originate at the centre and the transonic point is in the inner region ( @xmath3 0.01 kpc ) . for small @xmath0 and large @xmath126 ,",
    "there are two transonic solutions .",
    "the outer transonic point is at the far distance ( within several hundreds of kiloparsec ) and the transonic solution through this point has a wide subsonic region .",
    "this widely spread subsonic region is similarly indicated by the isothermal model @xcite .",
    "when @xmath126 is small , @xmath29 becomes negative and there is no transonic solution .    to clarify the influence of @xmath0 on the polytropic model , we alter @xmath0 arbitrarily and estimate @xmath126 by fitting starting points for the assumed starting point of @xmath123 kpc .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "when @xmath0 is close to 1 ( corresponding to an isothermal state ) , the fitted @xmath126 is large and the transonic point is within several hundreds of kiloparsec .",
    "small @xmath0 indicates that a large amount of energy is contained in the interstellar medium .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that large @xmath126 indicates that a large amount of energy is retained after radiative cooling .",
    "when @xmath0 is large , the fitted @xmath126 becomes small and the transonic point moves outward . finally , small @xmath0 with small @xmath126 indicates that a small amount of energy is retained in the interstellar medium .",
    "thus , it is difficult to accelerate outflows and the outer transonic point is at the far distance .",
    "because previous studies have focused on supersonic solutions , we show these solutions in fig .",
    "@xcite and @xcite fixed starting points at @xmath133pc@xmath134,\\mathcal{m})=(200,1)$ ] for supersonic solutions .",
    "therefore , we also fix starting points in the same position .",
    "the velocities of both the transonic and supersonic solutions converge to the same @xmath96 in the far distance , but the slopes of the velocity distributions differ considerably . the transonic solution is accelerated beyond the o - point ( @xmath135 kpc ) , while the supersonic solution is decelerated in this region .",
    "the density and the temperature of both solutions decrease , but those of the transonic solution are higher than those of the supersonic solution . in the subsonic region , because supersonic outflows can lead to reduced density and temperature through rapid expansion with high velocity , and because the transonic solution becomes supersonic in the far distance , the density and the temperature of the transonic solution are also higher than those of the supersonic solution .    .",
    "the horizontal and vertical axes represent @xmath126 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the colours of the various regions correspond to the solution types shown in fig .",
    "transonic solutions do not exist in the grey region , because the total energy is negative . ]",
    "we have revealed polytropic transonic solutions of spherically symmetric and steady galactic winds considering the gravitational potentials of a dark matter halo ( dmh ) and supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "these solutions have been classified in terms of their topological features in the diagrams shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "further , we have classified the transonic solutions as shown in figs . [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "similar to @xcite , we conclude that the gravitational potential of the smbh adds a new branch to the transonic solutions generated by considering the gravity of the dmh .",
    "the inner transonic point is formed by the gravity of the smbh , whereas the outer transonic point is due to that of dmh .",
    "the transonic solution types depend on the mass distribution , the amount of supplied energy , the polytropic index @xmath0 , and the slope @xmath1 of the dmh mass distribution . when @xmath1 becomes larger than a critical value @xmath2 , the transonic solution types change dramatically .",
    "we have also found the analytical relation between @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "we have estimated the parameter ranges for actual galaxies using the results of prior studies .",
    "the most interesting feature revealed by this model is the possibility that two transonic points may occur in the quasi - isothermal state ( small @xmath0 ) .",
    "these two transonic solutions have different mass fluxes and different starting points .",
    "thus , the transonic solution type influences the galactic evolution and the release of metals from galaxies .",
    "the transonic solution through the outer transonic point generated by the gravitational potential of the dmh indicates the possibility of a slowly accelerating outflow .",
    "we have found that it is possible for this slowly accelerating outflow to exist even in quiescent galaxies with small @xmath0 .",
    "further , this slowly accelerating outflow differs from the results of many previous studies focusing on supersonic outflows in active star - forming galaxies .",
    "also , with regard to active star - forming galaxies , our model indicates that outflows have only one transonic point in the inner region ( @xmath136 kpc ) .",
    "this result is not strongly dependent on @xmath0 .",
    "we have predicted that the polytropic model has a different mass flux from that of the isothermal model , because the isothermal wind can be supplied with an unlimited amount of energy , whereas the energy supplied to the polytropic wind is limited .",
    "for example , we have applied the polytropic model with mass flux supplied by stellar components to the sombrero galaxy , and concluded that this approach can reproduce the observed gas density and temperature distributions well .",
    "this result differs significantly from the isothermal model , which has unrealistically large mass flux @xcite .",
    "thus , we have concluded that the polytropic model is more realistic than the isothermal model , and that the sombrero galaxy has a slowly accelerating outflow .",
    "it is difficult to observe this slowly accelerating outflow via x - ray monitoring , because the outflow velocity in this galaxy is expected to be low .",
    "we expect that next - generation x - ray observation satellites will have the ability to detect the detailed structure of these outflows with higher resolution . in future research",
    ", we will construct an outflow model incorporating energy and mass injection along the flow lines in order to more accurately reproduce the observed velocity distributions .",
    "finally , we have focused on the influence of @xmath0 on the transonic solutions and have investigated the gas density , temperature , and velocity distributions of a actual galaxy with dmh mass @xmath137 .",
    "we have concluded that the slopes of the transonic solution distributions are strongly dependent on @xmath0 and the amount of energy in the system .",
    "we have also compared the transonic and supersonic solutions , and found that the transonic solutions accelerate in the region beyond the o - point while the supersonic solutions decelerate .",

    "<S> polytropic transonic solutions of spherically symmetric and steady galactic winds in the gravitational potential of a dark matter halo ( dmh ) with a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) are studied . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions are classified in terms of their topological features , and the gravitational potential of the smbh adds a new branch to the transonic solutions generated by the gravity of the dmh . </S>",
    "<S> the topological types of the transonic solutions depend on the mass distribution , the amount of supplied energy , the polytropic index @xmath0 , and the slope @xmath1 of the dmh mass distribution . when @xmath1 becomes larger than a critical value @xmath2 , the transonic solution types change dramatically . </S>",
    "<S> further , our model predicts that it is possible for a slowly accelerating outflow to exist , even in quiescent galaxies with small @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this slowly accelerating outflow differs from those considered in many of the previous studies focusing on supersonic outflows in active star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our model indicates that outflows in active star - forming galaxies have only one transonic point in the inner region ( @xmath3 0.01 kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the locus of this transonic point does not strongly depend on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the polytropic model incorporating mass flux supplied by stellar components to the sombrero galaxy , and conclude that it can reproduce the observed gas density and the temperature distribution well . </S>",
    "<S> this result differs significantly from the isothermal model , which requires an unrealistically large mass flux @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that the polytropic model is more realistic than the isothermal model , and that the sombrero galaxy can have a slowly accelerating outflow .    </S>",
