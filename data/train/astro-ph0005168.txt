    "interacting galaxies are considered to have a wide importance on triggering of starburst and agn activity .",
    "therefore , we have investigated two subsamples of spectroscopically - selected , x - ray detected interacting seyfert 1s , including nls1 , and seyfert 2s galaxies ( rafanelli et al.,1995 ) with @xmath2 .",
    "+ the pairs have been selected on poss plates using the following criteria given by rafanelli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) : separation between the components @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the apparent major axis of theseyfert galaxy , and a magnitude - difference between seyfert and the companion@xmath5 .",
    "the identification is based on x - ray contour lines overlaid on optical images taken from dss . in fig .",
    "1 we show as an example the overlay from the nls1 galaxy mkn 896 .",
    "2 shows the spectrum of this object .",
    "the deviation from the fit at energy 0.7 kev in fig .",
    "2 indicates the presence of a warm absorber .",
    "the pointing and survey lightcurves in fig .",
    "3 show the variability of this source on short time scales .",
    "to derive the interaction strength @xmath1 , we concentrate on the tidal force per unit mass produced by a companion on a primary galaxy , which is proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is the mass of the companion and @xmath8 is its distance from the center of the primary galaxy . in most cases ,",
    "@xmath7 and the absolute value of @xmath8 are unknown . instead",
    ", these parameters are related to the dimensions of the pair .",
    "rubin et al . (",
    "1982 ) describe the dependence of the mass @xmath9 of a galaxy on the size of its major axis @xmath10 as @xmath11 and we use @xmath12 ( dahari , 1984 ) .",
    "if we utilize the apparent diameter of the primary galaxy @xmath4 as a scaling factor , we obtain : @xmath13 using these relations , we get as the dimensionless gravitational interaction strength @xmath1 : @xmath14 this parameter is obviously large for close and relatively large companions .",
    "fig.4 shows interaction strength @xmath1 vs. the x - ray luminosity for seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "noticeable is a faint tendency for the luminosity increase for increasing values of interaction strength .",
    "a possible explanation for the low luminosity sources are the presence of a high hydrogen column density in the nucleus and the emission from the circumnuclear starbursts .",
    "+ the galaxy interactions or mergers are able to trigger a burst of star formation , which can be a reason for the rise in luminosity .",
    "several studies about physical mechanisms which could trigger a burst of strong star formation have been investigated by barnes & hernquist ( 1991 ) , jog & das ( 1992 ) and jog & solomon ( 1992 ) .",
    "also many observations suggest that galactic encounters enhance star formation rates , as demonstrated by studies of the optical ( e.g. , kennicut et al . 1987 ; bushouse 1987 ) , infrared ( e.g. , bernlhr 1993 ; telesco et al .",
    "1993 ) and radio ( e.g. , hummel 1981 ; smith & kassim 1993 ) emission from interacting systems .",
    "+ for each source detected in the all - sky survey with more than 100 counts in an exposure time of 400 sec and for all sources within pointed observations , we performed a spectral analysis and created a lightcurve .",
    "studies of variability were possible , if more than one pointed observation was available or if both a detection in the survey and in a pointed observation existed .",
    "we are extending our studies on starburst galaxies to examine the influence of interaction with companions on the x - ray luminosity .",
    "a paper with data concerning x - ray properties , luminosity , flux , count rate variation and lightcurves for seyfert 1s & 2s is in preparation ."
