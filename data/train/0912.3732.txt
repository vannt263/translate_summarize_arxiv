    "much progress has been made lately in the understanding of localization and delocalization phenomena for random polymer models and especially for a directed polymer in a random environment ( see @xcite for reviews on the subject ) .",
    "the directed polymer in random environment was first introduced in a discrete setup , where the polymer is modeled by the graph of a random walk in @xmath2 and the polymer measure is a modification of the law of a simple random walk on @xmath2 . recently ,",
    "though , there has been much interest in the corresponding continuous models , involving brownian motion rather than simple random walk ( see @xcite ) , or semicontinuous models ( continuous time and discrete space @xcite , discrete time and continuous space @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of these continuous or semicontinuous models is that they allow the use of techniques from stochastic calculus to derive results in a simple way .",
    "another advantage is that they are a natural framework in which to study the influence of spatial correlation in the environment . in this paper , we investigate the influence of slowly vanishing spatial correlation for the directed polymer in brownian environment , first introduced by rovira and tindel @xcite , which we now describe .",

    "informally , the field can be seen as a summation in time of independent , infinitesimal translation - invariant fields @xmath8 with covariance function @xmath9 . to avoid normalization ,",
    "we assume @xmath10 .",
    "we define the random hamiltonian formally as @xmath11 for a more precise definition of @xmath12 , we refer to @xcite , section 2 , where a rigorous meaning is given for the above formula .",
    "notice that with this definition , @xmath13 is a centered gaussian field indexed by the continuous function @xmath14 $ ] , with covariance matrix @xmath15:=\\int_{0}^{t}q\\bigl(b^{(1)}_s - b^{(2)}_s\\bigr)\\,{\\mathrm d}s.\\ ] ] for most of the purposes of this article , this could be considered as the definition of @xmath12 .",

    "it follows from a standard argument ( checking that the event is in the tail @xmath29-algebra ) that @xmath30 bolthausen first had the idea of studying this martingale for polymers in a discrete setup @xcite .",
    "he used it to prove that when the transversal dimension @xmath31 is larger than @xmath32 and @xmath16 is small enough , the behavior of the polymer trajectory @xmath33 is diffusive under @xmath22 .",
    "the technique has since been improved by comets and yoshida @xcite to prove that whenever @xmath28 is nondegenerate , diffusivity holds .",
    "the argument of @xcite can be adapted to our brownian case .",
    "when @xmath34 we say that _ weak disorder _ holds ; the situation where @xmath35 is referred to as _",
    "strong disorder_.    in the gaussian setup , a partial annealing argument shows that increasing @xmath16 increases the influence of disorder .",

    "this is also valid for @xmath41 .",
    "averaging with respect to @xmath39 on the right - hand side gives @xmath42 moreover , for a given realization of @xmath38 , @xmath43 implies that @xmath44 and , therefore , @xmath45 as a consequence , there exists a critical value @xmath46 separating the two phases , that is , there exists @xmath47 such that @xmath48    from the physicist s point of view , it is , however , more natural to have a definition of strong disorder using free energy .",
    "the quantity to consider is the difference between quenched and annealed free energy .",
    "limit @xmath49=:\\lim_{t\\rightarrow \\infty } p_t({\\beta})\\ ] ] exists and is almost surely constant .",
    "the function @xmath50 is nonpositive and nonincreasing .",
    "we can define @xmath51 it is obvious from the definitions that @xmath52 .    for a proof of the existence of the limits above and their equality",
    ", we refer to @xcite , lemma 2.4 , proposition 2.6 .",
    "the nonpositivity follows from jensen s inequality @xmath53\\le\\log{\\mathbf p}[w_t]=0.\\ ] ]    it can be shown ( for results in the discrete setup , see @xcite ) that an exponential decay of @xmath26 corresponds to a significant localization property of the trajectories .",
    "more precisely , under this condition , it can be shown that two paths chosen independently with law @xmath54 tend to spend a positive fraction of the time in the same neighborhood .",
    "for example , whenever the left - hand side exists [ i.e. , everywhere except for perhaps countably many @xmath16 , as @xmath55 is a convex function ] , we have @xmath56;\\ ] ] see @xcite , section 7 , where this equality is proved for directed polymers in @xmath57 .",
    "it has become customary to refer to this situation as _ very strong disorder_.    it is widely expected that the two notions of strong disorder coincide outside the critical point and that we have @xmath58 .",
    "however , it remains an open and challenging conjecture . in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that for the directed polymer in @xmath57 with @xmath59 and i.i.d .",
    "site disorder , very strong disorder holds at all temperatures , and it was previously well known that there is a nontrivial phase transition when @xmath1 .",
    "the same is expected to hold in continuous space and time if the correlation function @xmath6 decays sufficiently fast at infinity .",
    "another widely studied issue for directed polymers is the superdiffusivity phenomenon @xcite . as mentioned earlier , in the weak disorder phase , the trajectory of the polymer conserves all the essential features of the nondisordered model ( i.e. , standard brownian motion ) .",
    "therefore , if one looks at a trajectory up to time @xmath23 , the end position of the chain , the maximal distance to the origin and the typical distance of a point in the chain to the origin are all of order @xmath60 .",
    "this is one of the features of a _ diffusive _ behavior .",
    "it is believed that in the _ strong disorder _",
    "phase , this property is changed , and that the quantities mentioned earlier are greater than @xmath60 ( the chain tends to go farther from the origin to reach a more favorable environment ) .",
    "physicists have conjectured that there exists a positive real number @xmath61 such that , under @xmath22 for large @xmath23 , @xmath62}\\|b_s\\|\\approx t^{\\xi}.\\ ] ] we refer to @xmath63 as the _ volume exponent_. it is believed that in the strong disorder phase , @xmath63 does not depend on the temperature and is equal to the exponent of the associated oriented last - passage percolation model which corresponds to zero temperature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the volume exponent should be related to the _ fluctuation exponent _ , @xmath64 which describes the fluctuation of @xmath65 around its average and is defined ( in an informal way ) by @xmath66 the two exponents should satisfy the scaling relation @xmath67 moreover , in dimension @xmath68 , an additional _ hyperscaling _ relation , @xmath69 , should hold and it is therefore widely believed that @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in larger dimensions , there is no consensus in the physics literature regarding the exponent values .",
    "superdiffusivity remains , however , a very challenging issue since , in most cases , the existence of @xmath63 and @xmath72 has not been rigorously established .",
    "however , some mathematical results have been obtained in various contexts related to directed polymers and can be translated informally as inequalities involving @xmath63 and @xmath72 .    for undirected first - passage percolation ,",
    "newman and piza proved that @xmath73 in every dimension @xcite and , in collaboration with licea @xcite , that @xmath74 in dimension @xmath75 ( corresponding to @xmath76 for a directed polymer ) , using geometric arguments .",
    "johansson proved @xcite that @xmath70 and @xmath71 for last - passage oriented percolation with i.i.d .",
    "exponential variables on @xmath77 ( this corresponds to the discrete directed polymer with @xmath78 ) .",
    "the method he employed relies on exact calculation and it is probably difficult to adapt to other cases .    for a discrete - time continuous - space directed polymer model , petermann @xcite proved that for @xmath76 , @xmath79 .",
    "mjane @xcite proved for the same model that @xmath73 in every dimension .",
    "the result of petermann has recently been adapted for brownian polymer in brownian environment by bezerra , tindel and viens  @xcite .    very recently , balazs , quastel and sepplinen @xcite computed the scaling exponent for the hopf ",
    "cole solution of the kpz / stochastic burgers equation , a  problem that can be interpreted as a @xmath80-dimensional directed polymer in a random environment given by space  time white noise .",
    "their result is coherent with physical predictions , that is , @xmath71 and @xmath81 and may lead to exact results for other models .",
    "sepplinen @xcite proved , for directed polymers with log - gamma distributed weight , that @xmath70 .",
    "as in johansson s case , his result relies on exact calculations that are specific to the particular distribution of the environment .",
    "in addition , the following relations linking @xmath63 and @xmath72 have been proven to hold in various contexts : @xmath82 ( see , e.g. , @xcite in the case of brownian polymer in poissonian environment ) , leading , for example , to @xmath83 in dimension @xmath84 .      in this paper , we focus ( mainly ) on the case where @xmath6 has power - law decay [ recall ( [ defqq ] ) ] .",
