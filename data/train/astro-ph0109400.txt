    "the nature of the very first generation of metal  free ( ` population iii ' ) stars has been debated for decades ( schwarzschild & spitzer 1953 ; ezer & cameron 1971 ) .",
    "it is often thought that the lack of efficient cooling mechanisms would lead to a top  heavy initial mass function ( imf ) ( larson 1998 ) , and particularly to the production of ` very massive stars ' ( vmss ) with @xmath2m@xmath3 ( carr , bond & arnett 1984 ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations of cooling primordial molecular gas have hinted that this is indeed the case : they find quasistatically - contracting gas clumps with characteristic densities @xmath4 and temperatures of a few hundred kelvin  a regime set by the properties of the chief coolant , molecular hydrogen ( bromm , coppi , & larson 2001a ; abel , bryan & norman 2000 ; nakamura & umemura 2001 ) .",
    "the jeans unstable clumps are of order a few hundred solar masses ; because the contraction is subsonic , further fragmentation is unlikely , suggesting that the very first stars were indeed very massive . among other properties",
    ", vmss would produce many more ionizing photons per unit stellar mass than ordinary stars ( bromm , kudritzki , & loeb 2001c ) , and have much harder spectra ; they could thus ionize heii ( tumlinson & shull 2000 ) .",
    "their existence would have important implications for the metal enrichment and reionization history of the universe .    the duration and extent of early metal ",
    "free star formation are not known , and depend on the complex and inhomogeneous process of early metal enrichment ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; madau , ferrara , & rees 2001 ) . at present ,",
    "the best evidence for vmss with @xmath5m@xmath3 may be from their distinctive nucleosynthetic products : vmss process more of their mass into alpha - elements than normal stars , and they finally explode by a mechanism ( pair instability ) that is very different from core - collapse supernovae ( fryer et  al .",
    "2001 ) , and which is unlikely to produce @xmath0-process elements ( heger & woosley 2001 , hereafter hw ) .",
    "metal - poor halo stars provide important fossil evidence for early nucleosynthesis because they extend to metallicities even lower than those inferred for the damped ly@xmath1 systems ( e.g. , ryan 2000 ) .",
    "recent observations of @xmath0process abundances as a function of [ fe / h ] in halo stars suggest that an initial population of rapidly evolving vmss provided an intial fe inventory without co  producing heavy @xmath0nuclei ( wasserburg & qian 2000 , hereafter wq ; qian & wasserburg 2001b ) . in this _",
    ", we estimate the total number of vmss necessary to produce the required pre - enrichment , and consider the consequences for reionization , in the spirit of previous papers ( e.g. haiman & loeb 1997 , miralda - escud & rees 1998 ) which have considered the connection between the metallicity of the ly@xmath1 forest at @xmath6 and high - redshift ionizing photon production for a normal imf . in all numerical estimates ,",
    "we assume a @xmath7cdm cosmology with @xmath8 .",
    "in figure [ yields ] we show vms yields as functions of mass , as computed by hw for stars in the mass range subject to pair instability explosions @xmath9 140 - 260 @xmath10 .",
    "such stars are completely disrupted and leave no remnants .",
    "stars with @xmath11m@xmath3 and @xmath12m@xmath3 are predicted instead to collapse to black holes without metal ejection ( hw ) ; thus , nucleosynthetic tracers only provide a lower limit on early star formation .",
    "the top panel shows the yields @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the total mass of element @xmath15 produced , and @xmath16 is the initial stellar mass ) , assuming a he core mass of @xmath17 as in hw . in zero metallicity stars the efficiency of nuclear  powered radial pulsations",
    "( baraffe , heger , & woosley 2001 ) and radiatively driven stellar winds ( kudritzki 2000 ) is greatly reduced , so mass loss is likely to be small . from the figure",
    "it is clear that iron provides an uncertain measure of vms formation .",
    "the amount of silicon burned into iron in the final vms explosion increases with the kinetic energy of the initial collapse , and thus the iron yield varies strongly with the core mass .",
    "yields of other nuclides depend less on @xmath16 .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ yields ] depicts the ratio of the mass of species @xmath15 produced in the vms to the total mass of metals , divided by the analogous ratio for solar abundances .",
    "it illustrates the non - solar yields of vmss .",
    "while the mass yield of oxygen is quite high , the @xmath1 elements si , s , and ca have enrichment factors relative to solar which are far above o. these trends are specific to very low / zero  metallicity vmss .",
    "the si yield is about @xmath18 in a @xmath19 vms which is metal - free ( hw ) , or has a metallicity @xmath20 ( portinari et  al .",
    ". however , the si yield drops by between 2 and 4 orders of magnitude for vmss with metallicity @xmath21 ( table 12 of portinari et  al .",
    "1998 ) ; likewise , the maximum si yield of type ii supernovae ( sne ) from progenitor stars of any mass and metallicity is about an order of magnitude less , @xmath22 .",
    "_ thus , at low metallicities si , s , ca abundances should be excellent tracers of population iii vmss . _",
    "no elements above the iron group are produced in the hw models for the pair instability explosion .",
    "if these models are correct , vmss should produce copious @xmath1-elements with very little associated @xmath0-element production .",
    "we now turn to observations .",
    "wq analysed data from observations of heavy @xmath0process abundances in metal  poor halo stars as a function of [ fe / h ] ( see fig .",
    "[ rprocess ] , _ top left _ ) .",
    "they found the following trend in the data . at the lowest metallicities , [ fe / h]@xmath23 ,",
    "the ba abundance is roughly constant .",
    "then , over a small range in fe abundance , @xmath24 } \\le 2.5 $ ] , there is a wide spread in the ba abundance of order 2 dex .",
    "they interpreted this sudden increase in the ba abundance dispersion as follows .",
    "previous studies of radioactive @xmath25i and @xmath26hf in meteorites appear to require two distinct classes of type ii sne to account for @xmath0process elemental abundances : high  frequency events ( h ) with characteristic timescales @xmath27yrs that produce heavy @xmath0process elements with mass numbers @xmath28 ( e.g. ba , eu ) and low  frequency events ( l ) with characteristic timescales @xmath29yrs that produce light @xmath0process elements with mass numbers @xmath30 ( e.g. iodine ) ( wasserburg , busso , & gallino 1996 ) . because of their shorter lifetime , the h events are the first sne to explode . as they are not associated with significant coproduction of iron , they will produce a wide scatter in ba abundance over a small range in [ fe / h ] .",
    "however , the region [ fe / h]@xmath23 , where the ba abundance is very low and roughly constant , was considered by wq and qian & wasserburg ( 2001b ) to be an initial or prompt inventory dominated by the contributions of very low - metallicity massive first - generation stars , which appear before h events and produce very small amounts of @xmath0-process elements relative to their iron production rate . in this case , the iron enrichment up to [ fe / h]@xmath31 is almost exclusively due to vmss .",
    "the finite ba abundance at [ fe / h]@xmath32 can be associated with very minor coproduction of ba in vmss , or trace contamination by h events ( see wq and qian & wasserburg 2001b ) .    from our previous discussion we would expect the trend seen in fe to be most strongly exhibited in the @xmath1 elements . in fig.[rprocess ] , we plot halo - star ba / h values against @xmath1 element abundances , using the data of mcwilliam et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) . indeed ,",
    "si and ca show the same trend of a low ba abundance at very low metallicity followed by a wide scatter over a small range in metallicity . on the other hand",
    ", we would expect these trends to be absent in elements less abundantly produced by vmss , which do not experience significant initial enrichment before normal star formation takes over .",
    "this is indeed seen : carbon shows merely a linear correlation between c and ba production with a great deal of scatter ( lower right panel ) .",
    "this provides additional supporting evidence for early vms formation .",
    "most importantly , while vms fe yields vary strongly as a function of mass , si and ca yields do not change widely above @xmath33 ( @xmath34 , from from eqn . 1 of hw ) . in  [ ion_photon ]",
    "we will use these yields to quantify the amount of early vms formation .",
    "although oxygen is the element produced most abundantly in vmss , unfortunately we can not use it to measure vms formation .",
    "oxygen abundance estimates in low metallicity stars are uncertain , with different trends of [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] claimed by different observers ( e.g. , israelian et  al .",
    "2001 ; carretta et  al .",
    "moreover , to the best of our knowledge , there is no substantial body of simultaneous o and @xmath0-process abundances in halo stars .",
    "note that the predicted o yields of vmss are similar to snii yields , and so the nucleosynthetic signature of vmss may be less distinct in o than in the @xmath1 elements ( see , however , qian & wasserburg 2001a ) .",
    "vmss are @xmath351 - 2 orders of magnitude more efficient than normal stars with a standard imf at producing ionizing photons , per unit stellar mass ( bromm et al 2001c ) .",
    "thus , even if the cooling and star formation efficiencies in gas with primordial composition are low , a much smaller fraction of the gas needs to be turned into stars in order to reionize the universe .",
    "we now attempt to determine if vmss could indeed have reionized the universe .",
    "the onset of the large increase in @xmath36 occurs when the abundances of si and ca are [ si / h]@xmath37  @xmath38 and [ ca / h]@xmath39  @xmath40 .",
    "let us assume that the igm was uniformly polluted by vmss up to this critical metallicity .",
    "( si abundances in the ly-@xmath1 forest yield [ si / h ]  @xmath41 , with a scatter of a factor @xmath42 [ cowie & songalia , 1998 ; ellison et al . , 2000 ] , in good agreement with our estimate of [ si / h]@xmath37 . )",
    "the number density @xmath43 of species @xmath15 relative to hydrogen ( @xmath44 ) at the critical metallicity is determined by the fraction @xmath45 of baryonic matter that was processed in vmss .",
    "using @xmath46_{\\rm jump } = { \\rm log } \\left ( \\frac{(n_{i}/n_{h})_{\\rm jump}}{(n_{i}/n_{h})_{\\odot } } \\right)$ ] , we have @xmath47_{\\rm jump}}/y_i . \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath48 is the mass fraction of species @xmath15 in the sun and @xmath49 is the mass yield of species @xmath15 from a vms . from fig . 1 , we have @xmath50 for all the stars with @xmath51 .",
    "we thus estimate that a fraction @xmath52 of all baryons must have been processed through vmss .",
    "ca yields a similar range , but extending up to @xmath53 .",
    "the result is fairly insensitive to the assumed imf since ca and in particular si yields are fairly constant for @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "an imf dominated by vmss with @xmath56 can be excluded since these stars produce very little fe , and the observed jump in ba abundance at [ fe / h]@xmath31 would not be seen .    in the above estimate",
    "we assume that metals produced by vmss are uniformly mixed throughout the igm , and this is a fairly uncertain assumption .",
    "it is possible that early star formation was highly biased and vmss only polluted some small fraction of the igm from which the halo stars formed .",
    "our estimate of @xmath45 would then be correspondingly reduced .",
    "nonetheless , metals have been detected even in _ underdense _ gas in the igm at @xmath57 , far from star forming regions ( schaye et al 2000 ) , plausibly the result of early uniform enrichment by popiii stars .",
    "we can use extended press - schechter theory to compute the extent to which vms debris should be over - represented in the galactic halo ; for typical assumptions , the enhancement factor is only @xmath58 ( madau & rees 2001 ) .",
    "how many ionizing photons does our estimated @xmath45 correspond to ?",
    "bromm et al ( 2001c ) have computed models of vms spectra and find that for @xmath59 vmss , the stellar effective temperature and luminosity per solar mass are approximately constant",
    ". from their models , a fraction @xmath60 of the baryons in the universe must have been processed through vmss to obtain 10 ( hi , hei , heii ) ionizing photons per h and he nucleus in the universe respectively ( see their table 1 and eq .",
    "9 ) . from this",
    ", we estimate that vmss must have radiated @xmath61(37 , 3070 , 815 ) photons above the ( hi , hei , heii ) ionization threshold , per h or he nucleus .",
    "this is probably an overestimate , because the stars which eject metals have lower masses , @xmath62 , than the stars considered by bromm et al .",
    "( 2001b ) . for 100@xmath63 stars",
    "the number of ionizing photons per solar mass is reduced by a factor @xmath64 for hi and hei and @xmath65 for heii ( bromm et al 2001c ; tumlinson & shull 2000 ) .",
    "the uncertainties in our estimate are almost certain to be dominated by our assumption of uniform metal mixing , and by our neglect of more massive stars @xmath66 which do not eject metals but collapse to black holes .",
    "could these ionizing photons escape from their host halos ?",
    "suppose that vmss originated in the first pregalactic objects able to cool within a hubble time , i.e. in halos of mass @xmath67 , ( fuller & couchman 2000 ; haiman , thoul & loeb 1996 ) .",
    "gas within such small halos is quickly ionized by the flux from a single vms , and the escape fraction of ionizing photons is therefore likely to be of order unity .",
    "we obtain the density profile of the gas @xmath68 by assuming it is initially isothermal at the virial temperature and demanding hydrostatic equilibrium within an nfw dark matter profile ( makino et al 1998 ) .",
    "the maximum recombination rate is @xmath69 .",
    "this is much smaller than the vms hi ionizing photon production rate , @xmath70 , and so the halo gas remains wholly ionized .",
    "moreover , gas within these small halos is easily photoevaporated : the baryonic gravitational binding energy , @xmath71 $ ] erg , is considerably less than the total ionizing radiation produced by a vms , @xmath72erg .",
    "the entire baryonic component of the halo will be photoevaporated on the sound - crossing timescale of the halo , @xmath73yrs , comparable to the lifetime of the vms , @xmath74yr .",
    "the amount of reionization is determined by competition between ionization and recombination .",
    "the increased mean density of the igm at high redshift @xmath75 significantly increases recombination rates . on the other hand , the gas clumping factor due to dense non - linear objects @xmath76 declines very sharply at high redshift , and is @xmath77 at @xmath78 , compared to @xmath79 at @xmath80 ( haiman , abel & madau 2001 ) .",
    "hence , the recombination time @xmath81 is in fact longer by a factor @xmath82 at @xmath78 .",
    "if ( many generations of ) vmss form over a hubble time @xmath83 at @xmath84 , then the number of recombinations is @xmath85^{1.5}(c/2)$ ] per hii and heiii particle , respectively .",
    "since the halo star abundances suggest that @xmath86 photons above the ( hi , hei , heii ) ionization threshold per h or he nucleus were produced , the filling factor of hii and heiii regions due to vmss may be @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "we may have underestimated the ionizing photon production rate and thus the filling factors by factors of a few , since we do not count vmss which collapse to black holes and do not eject their metals .",
    "it is thus plausible that the igm was completely ionized by vmss .",
    "once the igm is reionized , a much lower comoving emissivity is required to keep it ionized at lower redshifts than to ionize it _ ab initio _ : the high igm temperature strongly suppresses gas accretion onto low mass halos @xmath89 , so the gas clumping factor remains small at lower redshift .",
    "this could reduce the comoving emissivity required for an ionized igm by a factor @xmath90 at @xmath80 .",
    "our estimate that @xmath91 is consistent with other estimates . due to feedback processes , it is unlikely that more than one vms forms per halo ( madau & rees 2001 ) . if vmss form in the first pregalactic objects able to cool within a hubble time , with masses @xmath92 , at a time when such halos collapse from 2.5 @xmath93 density peaks in the universe and contain @xmath94 of the total mass of the universe , then @xmath95 ( where @xmath96 ) .",
    "normal star formation probably starts when the gas metallicity is sufficiently high for efficient metal - line cooling , reducing the jeans mass and enhancing fragmentation .",
    "bromm et  al .",
    "( 2001b ) find from numerical simulations that this is likely to take place once @xmath97 reaches @xmath98 .",
    "similarly , hellsten & lin ( 1997 ) find that the critical metallicity for isobarically cooling gas at @xmath99k @xmath100 to cool to @xmath101k is [ fe / h]@xmath31 , the critical metallicity identified by wq . since half the main - sequence mass of a vms becomes metals in the hw models ,",
    "our estimate of @xmath102 corresponds roughly to @xmath103 . however , caution is necessary because the cooling studies used solar metal abundances scaled with metallicity , which are very different from the hw yields",
    ". the difference may be unimportant if oxygen is the dominant coolant ( since o yields from hw scale with metallicity in roughly solar ratios , see fig .",
    "1 ) , but a direct comparison requires a rigorous calculation of the cooling properties of gases with non - solar ratios of metal abundances .    finally , due to the high effective temperature of vmss , heii may reionize at high redshift in vms reionization scenarios , only to recombine once ordinary stars with softer spectra become predominant ( subsequent heii reionization only took place at @xmath6 , as observed by kriss et al 2001 ) . in standard stellar reionization scenarios , heii reionization takes place only once , when quasars turn on .",
    "the higher temperatures achievable with early heii reionization would have interesting consequences for the thermal history of the igm ( miralda - escude & rees 1994 ; abel & haehnelt 1999 ) , and the heii recombination lines produced in the host halo may eventually be observable with ngst ( oh , haiman & rees 2001 ; tumlinson , giroux & shull 2001 ) .",
    "we thank a. heger for providing his calculations of the metal yields from very massive stars .",
