    "one objective of nuclear theory , not reached yet , is an accurate method to compute the binding energy of nuclides globally  that is , from helium to the superheavies beyond uranium , and to the driplines relevant to nucleosynthesis .",
    "the most successful and widely referenced approaches are semiclassical , such as the finite - range droplet model @xcite and the extended thomas - fermi plus strutinski - integral model @xcite .",
    "exact , fully quantum mechanical _ ab initio _ microscopic calculations starting from experimental nn scattering have been successful @xcite but are computationally too demanding for all but the lightest nuclei .    what about less ambitious but still microscopic approaches ?",
    "the method of choice for a global description has been mean - field models such as hartree - fock ( hf ) with a phenomenological interaction ( e.g. skyrme ) @xcite . for computational simplicity",
    "hartree - fock is easiest to apply to spherical nuclei , although advances in computers allow one to treat deformed hf as well ; in that case the deformed hf state breaks rotational symmetry .",
    "other symmetries that are broken by hartree - fock include translational invariance and ( for hartree - fock - bogoliubov ) particle - number conservation .",
    "mean - field theory thus leaves out both `` kinematic '' correlations , which restore broken symmetries and which must be corrected for approximately @xcite , and `` dynamical '' correlations , which arise from the residual two - body interaction .    the interacting shell model ( sm ) , which diagonalizes an effective hamiltonian in a basis of shell - model configurations , includes correlations , respects rotational invariance and other symmetries , and yields accurate binding energies , but at a computational price .",
    "shell model calculations are currently limited to about @xmath1 basis states , which restricts one to light to medium nuclei ( @xmath2 ) for full @xmath0 calculations .",
    "furthermore , there is no global shell model interaction ; instead one must derive or fit an effective interaction for each regime such as the @xmath3-shell ( with valence nucleons between magic numbers of 8 and 20 ) and the @xmath4-shell ( between magic numbers of 20 and 40 ) .    the random phase approximation , or rpa",
    ", @xcite is an appealing middle ground because it adds correlations to the mean - field state and is numerically more tractable than full diagonalization in a sm basis ; it also exactly separates out spurious modes induced by symmetry breaking .",
    "because rpa implicitly treats 2-particle , 2-hole correlations in the ground state , one might imagine rpa to be an approximation to a more sophisticated microscopic model , a kind of cleverly truncated interacting shell model so to speak .",
    "this image is erroneous because , unlike hf and the interacting sm , rpa is not a variational theory , and in fact , rpa can overestimate the ` exact ' binding energy .",
    "( this of course supposes one has the ` correct ' effective interaction in the first place , a big question we will not attempt to answer ) .",
    "surprisingly , tests of hf+rpa calculations of binding energies in the literature have been scant and all have been against simple models : the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model @xcite , a schematic interaction in a small shell - model space @xcite ( here hf+rpa did poorly in describing the `` exact '' binding energy ) , a generalized 3-level lmg model @xcite and a two - level pairing model @xcite . based particularly on the success of the latter two cases , bertsch and hagino advanced the idea of using the mean - field theory corrected through rpa for nuclear binding - energy systematics @xcite .",
    "this history motivates us to test the accuracy of rpa with respect to other microscopic calculations .",
    "we present a thorough study , comparing rpa to exact sm calculations in a large number of non - trivial systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the model space and the interaction used , shortly reviews the approach and compares the rpa and exact correlation energies for several nuclei .",
    "we find that rpa reproduces well the ground state energy for a large number of nuclides .",
    "because the hf+rpa occasionally misses the binding energy , we attempt in section iii to determine if the accuracy of the hf+rpa binding energy correlates with properties of the hf state , such as deformation geometry or the overlap of the hf state with the exact ground state .",
    "we find no such relationship . and because rpa is often said to `` restore '' broken symmetries , in section iv we compare the kinetic energy of the rpa zero modes ( associated with symmetry restoration ) with the `` kinematic '' correlation energy obtained by projecting the hf state onto good @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section v.",
    "in the interacting shell model one restricts the model space to a limited set of valence fermion states outside an inert core , interacting via a residual two - body hamiltonian .",
    "we consider nuclei throughout the @xmath3-shell , with an @xmath6o core and using the wildenthal usd interaction @xcite , and in the lower @xmath4-shell , with a @xmath7ca core and using the modified kb3 interaction @xcite .",
    "for each nucleus investigated in this paper we are able to perform a full 0@xmath8 diagonalization ; in the same valence space we calculate the hf solution using separate slater determinants for protons and neutrons . in this restricted model",
    "there is no mixing of radial degrees of freedom , the only degrees of freedom being angular .",
    "we emphasize that this is nonetheless a much more sophisticated testing ground for hf+rpa than the usual toy models .",
    "several textbooks discuss extensively the matrix formulation of rpa ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , so we only summarize .",
    "one starts with a self - consistent mean - field solution , a hartree - fock slater determinant , which can break symmetries of the hamiltonian and which ignores correlations .",
    "the _ correlation energy _ is the additional binding energy that arises from particle - hole correlations .",
    "for example , if one performs a shell - model diagonalization in the full space , then the shell - model correlation energy , which we consider to be the exact correlation energy , is @xmath9    to derive the correlation energy in rpa , one treats the energy surface around the hartree - fock minimum as a multi - dimensional harmonic oscillator , which allows one to compute excited states as 1-particle , 1-hole ( 1p-1h ) configurations , as well as to compute corrections to the ground state energy .",
    "this last is approximately the correlation energy from an admixture of 2p-2h configurations .",
    "because in the mapping to a multi - dimensional harmonic oscillator one has bosonized the energy surface , rpa does not rigorously enforce the pauli principle , so rpa implicitly assumes the admixture of 2p-2h states into the ground state is small .",
    "the resulting rpa matrix equation is well - known : @xmath10 with @xmath11 \\right ] \\right | hf   \\right \\rangle , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "b_{nj , mi } \\equiv \\left \\langle hf   \\left | \\left [    [ \\hat{h } , \\hat{c}^\\dagger_n \\hat{c}_j ] , \\hat{c}^\\dagger_m \\hat{c}_i \\right ] \\right | hf   \\right \\rangle .",
    "\\label{abdefn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    most applications of rpa are to transition strengths and excitation energies , but one can also derive the rpa correlation energy : @xmath12 one can also compute the correlation energy in the response - function formulation of rpa @xcite .",
    "a particular feature of the rpa is the appearance of zero frequencies which correspond to conserved quantities , sometimes interpreted as restoration of broken symmetries @xcite . in our restricted model space",
    ", the mean field can break the rotational symmetry ; therefore , the number of zero rpa frequencies is related to the shape of the hf solution .",
    "thus , when the hf solution is spherical , there are no zero modes ; when axially symmetric , we get two zero eigenfrequencies , while for triaxial shapes we obtain three .",
    "the zero modes require careful treatment , and one can rewrite eqn .",
    "( [ ecorr1 ] ) : @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the canonical momentum operators corresponding to zero modes ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "( [ ecorr1 ] ) and ( [ ecorr2 ] ) are equivalent , but the latter explicitly segregates the contribution from zero modes , that is , from restored symmetries @xcite .",
    "we compare the kinetic energy due to the zero modes against the correlation energy obtained through projection of the hf state onto good @xmath5 in section iv",
    ".    ideally one would hope for a good agreement between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "figures 1 - 5 compare the exact and rpa correlation energies for nuclides in the @xmath3- and @xmath4-shells respectively .",
    "note that it is not our intention at this moment to test against the experimental data . in the @xmath3-shell",
    "all the nuclei are numerically tractable for a full diagonalization ; for an easier comparison we grouped into even - even ( fig .",
    "1 ) , even - odd ( fig .",
    "2 ) , odd - odd ( fig .",
    "3 ) and oxygen isotopes , that is , only neutrons active ( fig .",
    "4 ) . in the @xmath4-shell",
    "the dimension of the sm basis rapidly increases with increasing the number of particles in the valence shell , limiting the number of exact cases we can hand ; in fig .",

    "the general trend is a good agreement between @xmath16 and @xmath15 ; in each group , except for oxygen , there is only one or two nuclides where rpa significantly overestimates or underestimates the correlation energy . in the @xmath3-shell ,",
    "if one excludes the oxygen results , the rms deviation for 41 nuclides is 870 kev ; in the lower @xmath4-shell , excluding calcium , the rms deviation is 480 kev for 11 nuclides .",
    "there was not a significant difference between even - even , odd - odd , and odd - even / even - odd nuclides .",
    "the single - species results were significantly worse , however : 1800 kev for 6 oxygen isotopes and 730 kev for 7 calcium isotopes .",
    "we search for potential explanations for this difference , as described in section iii below , but found none .    despite these limitations , based on the results presented in figs . 1 - 5",
    ", one can assert that rpa seems to be a promising candidate for a global microscopic theory of the ground state energies , as advanced in @xcite .",
    "despite our overall good agreement , rpa sometimes fails to accurately reproduce the exact correlation energy . in this section",
    "we search for measures that correlate with the success or failure of rpa , which may in turn point towards possible solutions .",
    "for example , if rpa fails to describe pairing correlations , one may turn to hartree - fock - bogoliubov + quasi - particle rpa . for another example",
    ", one might expect rpa , which implicitly assumes only small 2p-2h correlations , to be more accurate when the original hf state has a large overlap with the exact ground state wavefunction .",
    "if this were the case , one might correct through some self - consistent or renormalized rpa scheme .    to quantify our search use the ratio @xmath17 @xmath18 when hf+rpa agrees with the exact shell - model binding energy .",
    "we begin by considering how well rpa works with different geometries of the mean - field solution . in particular , how well does the rpa correlation energy account for ( `` restore '' ) broken symmetries ?",
    "table i lists the deformation geometry ( spherical , prolate , oblate , triaxial ) for various nuclides ; we compute @xmath19 , @xmath20 by diagonalizing the mass quadrupole tensor of valence nucleons for the hf state @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 is close to one for a wide range of deformation parameters .",
    "in fact , if anything rpa is _ less _ reliable for a spherical mean - field geometry , overestimating the correlation energy by as much as a factor of two .",
    "this result is surprising . in exact shell - model calculations ,",
    "the excited states for these `` spherical '' nuclei are dominated by 1-particle 1-hole configurations , so one might expect rpa to be more successful than for `` deformed '' nuclei .",

    "we have investigated the accuracy of hf+rpa for computing the nuclear binding energies , by comparing against the exact shell - model binding energies obtained through full @xmath0 diagonalization . in simpler models @xcite , the rpa binding energy is generally , but not always @xcite , satisfactory .",
    "we found this also to be true with our significantly more complicated shell - model hamiltonians .",
    "there were some non - trivial cases where rpa did not accurately estimate the exact binding energy ; however , aside from the rather unhelpful observation that the inaccuracies tended to be worse for single - species cases , we could find no useful correlate with the accuracy of rpa .",
    "we did find , however , that rpa tended to yield very good results for deformed nuclides ; despite this , however , the part of the rpa correlation energy identifiable with rotational kinetic energy had no relation with the energy gained from projection .",
    "how could one make rpa more reliable ?",
    "there are two obvious steps .",
    "the first is to attempt to build pairing directly into the mean - field state through hartree - fock - bogolyubov and then computing the quasiparticle - rpa correlations energy . because we found no relation between the accurate calculation of the expectation value of the pairing hamiltonian and the accurate calculation of the total binding energy , however , we are far from confident that hfb+qrpa will yield significant gains .",
    "the other possibility is to correct rpa for its violation of the pauli principle as well as using the rpa ground state wavefunction function in computing * a * and * b * matrices in equation ( [ abdefn ] ) .",
    "the literature documents numerous proposals along these lines : self - consistent renormalization of the mean - field single - particle energies and the residual interaction @xcite ; treating the particle - hole amplitudes as variational parameters @xcite ; rederivation of the rpa equations via the `` number - operator method '' to account for ground state correlations @xcite ; and dressing the rpa phonons to account for ground state correlations @xcite .",
    "none of these methods have become widely accepted , and they overlap each other to a large degree , although the literature does not clarify similarities and differences . as in the case of ungarnished rpa",
    ", these proposals for improving rpa have only been tested against toys such as the lipkin model @xcite . perhaps by implementing these various proposals for full - scale shell model calculations",
    "one could compare their efficacy and practicality .",
    "this we leave to future work ."
