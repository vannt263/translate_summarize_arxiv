    "@xcite for a detailed formal analysis . for the sake of our scopes , it is sufficient to mention here that , under the assumptions of strong external driving and high - quality mechanical motion , which is generally affected by incoherent brownian noise at temperature @xmath71 , the optomechanical evolution can be split into a ( classical ) mean - field part , and a ( quantum ) fluctuation - affected one .",
    "the latter is what we concentrate on , as it encompasses non - trivial correlations between the optical and mechanical sub - parts of our system  @xcite .",
    "we thus assume to be in a position to expand any operator @xmath72 of the system as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the corresponding mean part , and define the vector of zero - mean fluctuations @xmath75 , which we use in order to define the covariance matrix of the fluctuations @xmath76 with elements @xmath77 , which can be shown to evolve according to the equation  @xcite @xmath78 where we have introduced the drift matrix @xmath79 and the noise one @xmath80 given by @xmath81,\\ , d= \\left [ \\begin{matrix } 0&0&0&0\\\\ 0&\\gamma(\\lambda)&0&0\\\\ 0&0&\\kappa&0\\\\ 0&0&0&\\kappa \\end{matrix } \\right].\\ ] ] in these expressions , @xmath82 is the natural damping rate of the mechanical motion , @xmath83 is the decay rate of the cavity field , @xmath84 is an effective optomechanical coupling rate and @xmath85 with @xmath86 , and @xmath87 the mean number of thermal phonons in the initial state of the mechanical oscillator ( which is assumed to be a gibbs state at the environmental temperature @xmath71 ) .",
    "quite evidently , the csl mechanism enters the dynamics of the optomechanical system only through the noise matrix @xmath80 and in the form of an additional source of mechanical damping .",
    "alternatively , the csl effect can be interpreted as an increased equilibrium temperature of the mechanical system ( cf .",
    "@xcite and bahrami _ et al .",

    "while the optimal estimation strategy for the inference of temperature of an equilibrium harmonic oscillator has been found to be provided by measurements of its energy ( the qfi being proportional to the variance of the energy of the oscillator )  @xcite , here we would like to exploit the coupling between the mechanical system and the cavity field to devise implementable strategies for the inference of @xmath1 . the inspection of eq .",
    "shows that the latter is only coupled to the position of the mechanical oscillator , which would not be sufficient to infer its energy directly .",
    "we thus proceed to a full - fledged analysis of the results achievable through the use of quantum estimation theory in the context set by this paper .    from the analysis reported in sec .",

    "[ fimauro ] is not linked to a specific experimental implementation and has been dictated by the visibility of the curves , the displayed behavior should be considered as canonical .",
    "a few considerations are in order .",
    "first , the variance associated with even the best measurement strategy ( as entailed by the qfi ) is very large showing that , at least with this setup , the estimate of @xmath45 would not be able to help ruling out the actual csl influences .",
    "second , the qfi appears to be largely insensitive of the actual value taken by the csl coupling strength for values of @xmath45 within a rather large range . in particular , the estimate @xmath102 falls well within such an _ insensitive _ region .",
    "the behavior of the qfi changes , instead , dramatically for @xmath103 , showing a knee almost in correspondence of the estimate by adler , and decreasing quickly as @xmath45 increases . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fimauro ] * ( b ) * we show that , at such _",
    "critical _ value of the csl coupling parameter , mechanical systems of a larger mass offer enhanced sensitivity and thus a lower variance associated with the estimation of @xmath104 , in accordance with the expectation that stronger reduction effects should be expected in massive systems .",
    "moreover , as large values of @xmath105 with respect to the cavity line width @xmath83 correspond to weaker optomechanical couplings ( cf . the form of parameter @xmath106 ) , we conclude that weakly - perturbed mechanical oscillators offer better performances .    *",

    "we thus address the estimation of @xmath1 from a different perspective , and investigate the amount of information that can be extracted by performing local gaussian measurements on the state of the optical subsystem instead .",
    "this approach is meaningful in light of the optomechanical coupling , which encodes information on the csl - affected mechanical oscillator onto appropriate degrees of freedom of the cavity field , and indeed embodies the standard way of inferring information on the mechanical motion  @xcite .",
    "we have thus calculated the qfi associated with the steady state of the optical field , repeating the analysis displayed in fig .",
    "[ fimauro ] .",
    "a noticeable difference between the two cases is , though , that the optical covariance matrix @xmath94 is , in general , non diagonal , which makes the provision of a fully analytical expression for @xmath101 inconvenient , in this case .",

    "moreover , in order to make use of the powerful framework for gaussian states probed by gaussian measurements illustrated above , we shall restrict the class of probing strategies to local gaussian ones , and consider both homodyne and heterodyne measurements .",
    "this can be done very conveniently using our parameterisation of @xmath120 and choosing appropriately the value of @xmath121 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath122 or @xmath123 we would implement homodyne detection , while heterodyning would correspond to @xmath124 .",
    "while the choice of @xmath125 would be inessential for the latter instance , the value of such angle determines the direction , in phase space , along which homodyning is performed . as one could expect , this is an important parameter in the determination of the best estimation strategy .",
    "we have calculated the fisher information @xmath126 in eq .   by varying the choice of @xmath121 and @xmath125 finding that , although none of the chosen strategies is _ optimal _ over the range of values of @xmath45 up to the estimate given by adler , homodyning appears to be superior to heterodyne measurements .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fi - qfioptics ] * ( a ) * , where one can appreciate that homodyne measurements result in values of the fisher information that are about one order of magnitude larger than those corresponding to heterodyning for @xmath45 up to @xmath127m@xmath128s@xmath129 .",
    "interestingly , we find that while for @xmath130 the fisher information and the qfi are both flat ( thus implying no improvement in the precision of the estimation of @xmath45 across tens of orders of magnitude ) , for @xmath131 the two figures of merit get very close to each other , regardless of the measurement strategy being implemented [ cf .",

    "the low values achieved by both @xmath101 and @xmath133 for @xmath131 , though , demonstrate the very weak sensitivity of the setting that we have chosen to reduction models characterized by coupling strengths in such region of values . in fig .",

    "where @xmath131 , we see that @xmath134 approaches @xmath135 .",
    "this is identical to the behaviour of the quantum signal - to - noise ratio for estimation of the temperature of a single quantum harmonic oscillator in a thermal state .",
    "as shown in eq ( [ equiv ] ) the csl mechanism behaves like an additional heating term , which dominates when @xmath136 . for our choice of parameters this inequality",

    "first of all , and as already demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fi - qfioptics ] * ( d ) * , @xmath134 for the mechanical subsystem is larger than @xmath134 for the optical one , since the cavity field is only indirectly affected by the csl mechanism . in fig .",
    "[ signaltonoiseparams ] * ( a ) * and * ( b ) * the three quantities are shown to decrease when the mass of the oscillator or the mechanical frequency is increased .",
    "this results from the dependence of the optomechanical coupling @xmath138 on @xmath139 .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of nimmrichter et .",
    "al . in @xcite .",
    "these figures also show that the gap widens between the quantum and classical signal - to - noise ratios as these quantities are increased , so the measurement procedure we describe moves further from optimality . in fig .",
    "[ signaltonoiseparams ] * ( c ) * the three quantities decrease when the initial temperature @xmath71 of the system is increased .",
    "this is expected as a higher initial temperature implies a higher amount of thermal noise .",
    "we also see that the gap closes between the quantum and classical signal - to - noise ratios at around @xmath140 .",
    "the mechanical @xmath134 is still higher than the optical one , as justified above , but the classical signal - to - noise ratio reaches @xmath134 for the optical subsystem , saturating the cramer - ro bound .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that at such high temperatures , the system will behave classically , and therefore the limit on the precision set by quantum mechanics is equal to the classical one .       in the unsqueezed case ( blue ) and in the squeezed case ( orange , dotted ) and the fisher information for a heterodyne measurement in the unsqueezed case ( cyan , dashed ) , and a homodyne measurement in the squeezed case ( magenta , dot - dashed ) are plotted against @xmath141 .",
    "different types of measurement have been chosen to achieve the optimal value of the fisher information .",
    "the oscillator contains @xmath142 excitations and is squeezed with squeezing parameter @xmath143 ( chosen for convenience of plotting ) . ]",
    "we now complement the analysis reported above by assessing whether potential advantages for the estimation performance could arise from the use of a genuinely quantum resource such as squeezing . several different experimental strategies for imposing squeezing on the mechanical oscillator are available  @xcite .",
    "however , rather than proceeding down this path , we qualitatively investigate the effect of introducing squeezing . in the system we describe above",
    ", the mechanical subsystem in the steady state is in a slightly squeezed thermal state , and the csl parameter enters the covariance matrix linearly .",
    "we considered a simpler version of this setup : a single oscillator , in a thermal state , characterised by it s initial thermal occupation number @xmath144 . by squeezing the oscillator , we add energy to the system , and the mean occupation number becomes @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the squeezing parameter .",
    "the csl mechanism , as expressed in eq .  , appears as an additive contribution to @xmath147 . to mimic this , a new `` csl - type '' parameter @xmath141 is introduced : @xmath148 .",
    "it is this @xmath141 which we estimate .",
    "since this system is also gaussian , we can use the same procedure as above to calculate @xmath149 for local gaussian measurements and @xmath150 .",
    "[ squeezingplot ] shows that estimation of @xmath141 without squeezing yields the same behaviour as shown in fig .",

    "when we introduce the squeezing , we see the same behaviour , but with an increase in @xmath150 , but a complementary decrease in the @xmath149 .",
    "so while there is an increase in precision offered by introducing squeezing , this increase is not practically achievable using local gaussian measurements .",
    "we conclude from this qualitative assessment that squeezing would not be a useful resource in the fully - fledged system .",

    "<S> we apply the formalism of quantum estimation theory to extract information about potential collapse mechanisms of the continuous spontaneous localisation ( csl ) form . in order to estimate the strength with which the field responsible for the csl mechanism couples to massive systems , we consider the optomechanical interaction between a mechanical resonator and a cavity field . </S>",
    "<S> our estimation strategy passes through the probing of either the state of the oscillator or that of the electromagnetic field that drives its motion . in particular , we concentrate on all - optical measurements , such as homodyne and heterodyne measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the performances of such strategies with those of a spin - assisted optomechanical system , where the estimation of the csl parameter is performed through time - gated spin - like measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> understanding the nature of the quantum - to - classical ( qtc ) transition is a long - sought problem that attracts an ever - growing attention  @xcite . while quantum mechanics has undergone exhaustive and extremely successful testings in the microscopic realm , the apparent absence of quantum manifestations at the macroscopic scale cries for a deeper understanding . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this lack of evidence reinforces the need of assessing the causes for the emergence of classical mechanics from fundamental quantum evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the most widely accepted theory behind such process is _ quantum decoherence _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : the environment surrounding any quantum system monitors its state continuously , practically collapsing the system s wavefunction and curtailing any quantum behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> such process is conjectured to occur more quickly with the growing _ size _ of the system at hand . under this regime , </S>",
    "<S> macroscopic superpositions would be possible in macroscopic systems perfectly isolated from their environment , a condition that is , for all practical purposes , not realisable .    </S>",
    "<S> however , a set of theories , usually referred to as collapse models ( cms ) , suggests an alternative route to the explanation of the qtc transition by putting forward fundamental underly- ing mechanisms responsible for the collapse of the wavefunction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of this effect should increase with the size ( mass ) of the system , leaving microscopic ( macroscopic ) systems fully within the quantum ( classical ) realm . </S>",
    "<S> the key difference between cms and standard quantum mechanics is that in the framework entailed by the former , perfectly isolated macroscopic objects would continue to act classically .    among the proposals put forward </S>",
    "<S> so far to test ( or rule out ) some of the currently formulated cms  @xcite , those based on the experimental platform of cavity optomechanics offer features of undemanding scalability of the mass of the system to be probed and high - sensitivity of measurement . </S>",
    "<S> most remarkably , at variance with standardly pursued approaches  @xcite , they bypass the need for the construction and quantum - limited management of large interferometers  @xcite . notwithstanding such promising features , the investigation of cms still poses considerable experimental challenges , and a winning strategy to their inference has not yet been singled out  @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose that a potentially significant _ boost _ to the experimental assessment of cms through optomechanical settings can come from the application of refined quantum inference techniques  @xcite that have been so far successfully applied to achieve quantum - limited estimation of parameters of difficult accessibility in sophisticated quantum optics experiments  @xcite . in order to fix the ideas and illustrate the pillars of our proposal in a concrete and relevant case , we focus on the continuous spontaneous localisation ( csl ) model  @xcite , which is one of the simplest and most studied cms  @xcite . by applying the tools of quantum estimation theory to a paradigmatic cavity optomechanics system </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the ultimate bounds on the estimation precision of the core parameter entering the csl model , thus going significantly beyond the achievements of any previous proposal in this context  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we identify a feasible , non - disruptive all - optical measurement strategy able to provide significant information on a csl - affected nano - mechanical oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we upgrade our system to a setup of hybrid cavity optomechanics which also includes a two - level system effectively coupled to the mechanical oscillator . by delegating the inference to measurements performed on the two - level system </S>",
    "<S> , we identify optimal instants of time and operating conditions that maximize the amount of information that could be extracted from the system itself .    </S>",
