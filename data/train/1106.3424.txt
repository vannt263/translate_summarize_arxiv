    "the zero - temperature random - field ising model ( zt - rfim ) is a prototype model for systems that exhibit avalanche dynamics when slowly driven accross athermal first - order phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "examples of such transitions include the condensation of fluids in porous media  @xcite , the martensitic transformation  @xcite , or magnetisation reversal of ferromagnets ( barkhausen effect )  @xcite . for experimentally reasonable time scales , thermal fluctuations do not play an important role and the dynamics in this kind of system proceed along a non - equilibrium path consisting of metastable states  @xcite .",
    "avalanches are a manifestation of such behaviour and correspond to the driven - induced passage between two metastable states .",
    "the zt - rfim predicts that the properties of avalanches ( e.g. their size or duration ) are drastically affected by the degree of quenched disorder in the system .",
    "more explicitly , the model predicts three different regimes for avalanche behaviour depending on the degree of disorder . the main feature of the small - disorder regime is the existence of an avalanche that is infinite in extent .",
    "in contrast , high degrees of disorder lead to a regime where all avalanches are small .",
    "these two regimes are separated by an intermediate situation where the model exhibits critical behaviour ( i.e. a continuous phase transition )  @xcite . for any degree of disorder ,",
    "avalanche - like dynamics lead to spacial correlations in observable properties averaged over quenched disorder ( e.g. magnetisation , stress or fluid density ) , which extend over a typical length scale , called the correlation length .",
    "this quantity is expected to diverge in the critical regime , and this has been shown to be the case in the systems described by mean field  @xcite and hypercubic lattices  @xcite . concerning other topologies , including a bethe lattice , the situation is less clear .",
    "previous studies of the zt - rfim on the bethe lattice have obtained exact results for the magnetisation  @xcite , the avalanche size distribution  @xcite , the different contributions to the energy  @xcite , and the number of metastable states  @xcite . in particular , it has been demonstrated that for coordination numbers @xmath0 the system exhibits a discontinuity in its magnetisation hysteresis loop for small amounts of disorder associated with the infinite avalanche .",
    "the universality class of the critical point on such a lattice has been suggested to be the same as that of the mean - field system ( complete graph )  @xcite , with the critical exponents for the order parameter , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , being identical to the mean - field values  @xcite .",
    "the spatial correlations of the model have also been investigated in the past but mostly using numerical simulations  @xcite or approximate analytical methods based on mean - field descriptions and/or renormalization group ( rg ) techniques  @xcite . in this paper , we derive an exact analytical expression for the spin - spin correlation function corresponding to the zt - rfim with spins placed on a bethe lattice .",
    "our results are exact for any coordination number and confirm the validity of the functional form for the correlation function derived independently in  @xcite , where it is assumed that the extension from the one - dimensional case ( i.e. with @xmath3 ) is valid .",
    "it is well established that in a hypercubic lattice of dimensionality @xmath4 around criticality , the correlation function , @xmath5 , decays exponentially with distance @xmath6 for the zt - rfim , @xmath7 where @xmath8 obeys a power law for large @xmath6 , and @xmath9 is the correlation length . at the critical point , @xmath10 , and",
    "so @xmath8 represents the critical behaviour of the correlation function , found to be @xmath11 with anomalous dimension @xmath12  @xcite . in a prototype loopless topology , the cayley tree or bethe lattice",
    ", the correlation function exhibits additional exponential behaviour due to the associated hyperbolic topology , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the coordination number and @xmath15 is a power - law function for large values of chemical distance @xmath6 . the exponential prefactor @xmath16 in   gives the number of lattice sites within @xmath6 shells of the bethe lattice , and plays the role of the factor @xmath17 in the equivalent expression for hypercubic lattices .",
    "the function @xmath18 with some exponent @xmath19 ( found below to be @xmath20 ) , accounts for all power - law behaviour of the correlation function .",
    "there is some inconsistency in the definition of the correlation length for two - state models ( the equilibrium ising model , the zt - rfim and percolation ) on the bethe lattice . in the equilibrium ising model  @xcite and the zt - rfim  @xcite on the bethe lattice",
    ", the prefactor @xmath21 in   has been absorbed into the definition of the correlation length @xmath22 with @xmath23 chosen to be the correlation length . in an alternative definition , for both percolation  @xcite and the ising model  @xcite ,",
    "the correlation length has instead been identified with @xmath9 in  , thus separating the length scale of dynamic correlations from the intrinsic topological length scale of the bethe lattice , @xmath24 .",
    "below , we demonstrate that ( i ) the value of @xmath9 diverges at the critical point according to a power law , in contrast to @xmath25 which remains finite at criticality and ( ii ) the critical exponents governing the divergence of @xmath9 around the critical point are consistent with the mean - field values for the divergence of correlation length in hypercubic lattices above the upper critical dimension , @xmath26 .",
    "the exponents , describing the divergence of @xmath9 in terms of the external field @xmath27 and degree of disorder @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , are found to be @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "as argued below , these values can be related to those in the mean - field model , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 originates from fractal dimension of a random walk  @xcite .",
    "therefore these findings motivate us to choose @xmath9 as the correlation length describing the critical behaviour of the zt - rfim on a bethe lattice . such a definition , while in contrast with that used in  @xcite ,",
    "separates the topological contribution of the bethe lattice to the correlation length , and allows its comparison with the correlation length for hypercubic lattices .",
    "the zt - rfim involves a set of @xmath36 ising spins , @xmath37 , interacting ferromagnetically with strength @xmath38 , affected by an external field @xmath27 and quenched local disorder , manifested in independent random local fields , @xmath39 , at each site @xmath40 , according to the following hamiltonian , @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes a sum over all pairs of nearest neighbours .",
    "the random fields @xmath39 are assumed to be identically distributed according to the probability density function @xmath43 with , for convenience , zero mean and standard deviation @xmath28 .",
    "it has been found that in certain topologies of the network of spins , and for disorder @xmath44 , the zt - rfim exhibits a discontinuity in the hysteresis loop for magnetisation , @xmath45 , at some coersive field @xmath46 , where the magnetisation in a large fraction of the system reverses in a single avalanche . increasing disorder is found to reduce the size of this discontinuity , and to remove it continuously at the critical value of disorder @xmath47 , around which spin - spin correlations become infinite - ranged and the system exhibits scale - free universal properties  @xcite .",
    "we start with a description of the dynamical rules governing the relaxation of spins within the zt - rfim .",
    "the external field is initially set to @xmath48 , forcing all spins to be @xmath49 , and then allowed to increase adiabatically to @xmath50 .",
    "when the external field is varied , the system becomes unstable and relaxes into a new metastable state through a series of spin flips .",
    "we assume that relaxation takes place according to glauber single - spin flip dynamics for the zero temperature case  @xcite , such that a spin flips only if such a flip reduces the overall energy .",
    "if a spin at node @xmath40 changes state ( i.e. @xmath51 ) , it induces a change in energy @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a local field . if @xmath54 then the spin flip will occur , otherwise it remains aligned with the local field .",
    "as spins flip one at a time  @xcite , the local field at surrounding sites changes , and other spins may become unstable and also flip , therefore relaxation occurs in an avalanche like manner . at a given external field",
    ", this process continues until all spins are aligned with their respective local fields at which point the system becomes stable , thus creating clusters of flipped spins around each nucleation site . as the external field increases avalanches continue to progress , and it is known that the set of spins that flip in multiple avalanches when the external field is slowly increased from @xmath55 to @xmath27 coincides with the set of spins that would flip if the field had stepped from @xmath55 to @xmath27 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , it can be assumed that the correlation function calculated at any external field depends only on the properties of avalanches occurring at that field .",
