    "the quenching of large-@xmath1 hadrons in heavy - ion collisions is undoubtedly one of the most important discoveries obtained so far at rhic energies ( @xmath2  gev ) , suggesting significant parton energy loss in the dense qcd medium produced in those reactions  @xcite .",
    "it was therefore quite natural to wonder whether a similar phenomenon would be observed , either qualitatively or quantitatively , in the first pb ",
    "pb collisions obtained at lhc at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath3  tev . even though data at this energy were then desperately lacking , the first alice measurements  @xcite soon indicated that the quenching of inclusive charged hadrons is indeed similar to what has been reported at rhic , at least in a large @xmath1 domain ( @xmath4  gev ) and within the experimental uncertainties .",
    "these first lhc data have later been confirmed by the atlas  @xcite , alice  @xcite , cms  @xcite preliminary measurements shown at this conference , which now extend up to @xmath5  gev .",
    "the results obtained at the lhc   together with the rhic measurements   thus open up hope for a better understanding of energy loss processes through detailed phenomenological studies .",
    "the quenching factor is defined as the normalized yield of particles in heavy - ion collisions ( in a given centrality class @xmath7 ) over the production cross section measured in collisions , @xmath8 where the thickness function @xmath9 is determined from a monte carlo glauber model .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath9 therefore translates into an overall normalization error on @xmath6 , which is of the order of 8% in central pb ",
    "pb collisions  @xcite . assuming that the production of _ hard _ processes , i.e. with a large energy scale @xmath10 , scales with the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath11 , the quenching factor  ( [ eq : defraa ] ) becomes @xmath12 in the absence of cold and hot medium effects . on the contrary",
    "the yield of _ soft _ particles ( e.g. light hadron production at small @xmath1 ) is expected to be proportional to the number of participating nucleons in the collision , @xmath13 , leading to @xmath14 in central a  a collisions .",
    "this conventional assumption , not obvious _ a priori _   for soft radiation and proportional to @xmath13 for hard radiation , due to the lpm coherence effect  @xcite , offering a counter - example .",
    "] , remains to be checked experimentally for a variety of `` baseline '' processes insensitive to medium effects .",
    "even though observing binary scaling for one hard process does not prove that this assumption is valid for another , at least this would give some confidence that this is indeed the case .",
    "the quenching factor also requires the knowledge of the production cross section at the same collision energy , as is the case at rhic . at lhc",
    ", various interpolation procedures using data at @xmath15 and 7  tev have been performed  tev p ",
    "p run in 2011 . ] assuming a power - law behavior for the @xmath16-dependence of the cross section at fixed @xmath1@xcite or fixed @xmath17@xcite .",
    "the latter is probably more appropriate  @xcite since at large @xmath1 the invariant production cross section is expected to scale like @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath1 interpolation is problematic from a statistical point of view since this procedure is limited to the maximal @xmath1-bin available at the _ lower _ center - of - mass energy , for which phase - space is more restricted . in order to check how these two interpolation prescriptions differ , i compared the yields at @xmath19  gev at @xmath20  tev using the cms data within those two procedures .",
    "remarkably , the yields differ by as much as @xmath21 , the @xmath1-interpolation leading to a yield _ smaller _ than the @xmath17-interpolation procedure . as a consequence , if data indeed follow @xmath17 scaling in the @xmath157  tev range , the measured yield at @xmath20  tev should be larger than the alice ( @xmath1-interpolated ) yield by @xmath22 , thus leading to @xmath6 values _ smaller _ by this amount  .",
    "this illustrates well the need for and a  a measurements at the same energy .",
    "the abundant production of hard processes in collisions at the lhc offers an outstanding opportunity for qcd studies .",
    "processes with many particles in the final state allow for probing multi - leg processes , while more inclusive observables set tight constraints on parton distribution functions ( pdf ) and fragmentation functions ( ff ) but also serve as _ reference processes _ to which heavy - ion measurements can be compared .",
    "remarkably , the first lhc measurements of prompt photons  @xcite and jets  @xcite proved in excellent agreement with qcd expectations . on the contrary , discrepancy between data and nlo calculations were reported in the hadron production channel  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is not clear yet , although it is worth stressing that ff are rather poorly constrained , especially in the gluon sector and at large momentum fraction @xmath23 .",
    "higher - twist processes might also contribute substantially to hadron production at not too large @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "it might be tempting to assume that the present uncertainties in the absolute cross sections are not an issue in heavy - ion collisions since these most likely cancel out in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defraa ] ) . as we shall see later",
    ", this is not necessarily the case , since the medium effects which affect @xmath6 actually depend on the dynamics of the hard process itself .",
    "it is thus important to keep in mind such uncertainties when discussing the various phenomenological studies and their assumptions .    in heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "measurements are made more delicate because of the larger underlying event .",
    "thanks to recent jet reconstruction techniques in high - multiplicity environments  @xcite , it has become possible to measure the @xmath6 of jets , at rhic and now at lhc  @xcite .",
    "these results nicely supplement hadron production data , as they allow for tracing more efficiently the dynamics of parton energy loss and induced gluon radiation in a medium  .",
    "although energy loss processes are expected to play an important role in the quenching of hadrons and jets , other effects could actually affect @xmath6 : nuclear pdf ( npdf ) and saturation effects , multiple scattering in nuclei and recombination processes in qgp , to cite a few examples .",
    "hopefully , most of these processes die out at transverse momenta at which the sole effects of parton energy loss remain visible .",
    "it is e.g. the case of npdf effects which become small at large @xmath1  20  gev where @xmath24  gev at lhc .",
    "] , below 20% above @xmath25  gev according to eps09  @xcite .",
    "in order to disentangle these mechanisms , it is essential to compare systematically hadron / jet data to baseline measurements :    * _ baseline experiments _ , typically deep inelastic scattering in nuclei ( @xmath26a ) or proton  nucleus ( @xmath0a ) collisions .",
    "these reactions allow for probing initial - state effects , such as npdf effects or parton propagation in a cold medium ; * _ baseline observables _ in heavy - ion collisions , such as prompt photon , drell - yan pair ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 production , which are expected to be insensitive to medium effects .",
    "yet , they are essential since they offer a `` normalization '' of @xmath6 in central heavy - ion collisions and serve as tests of the binary collision scaling assumption .    the need for baseline measurements is best exemplified at rhic , where @xmath6 of hadrons in @xmath29au collisions and that of photons in au  au collisions strongly suggest that the hadron quenching at rhic is a genuine phenomenon ( i.e. not a normalization artifact ) due to a final - state effect . at lhc ,",
    "the situation is extremely encouraging regarding the production of electroweak observables , as shown by the first @xmath30 and isolated photon measurements by cms  @xcite . as discussed in  @xcite , a dedicated @xmath0pb run at the lhc",
    "is needed and hopefully will be carried out before shutdown in 2013 .",
    "before discussing more specific models , i discuss in this section qualitative   but hopefully model - independent   features of parton energy loss on @xmath6 .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that the rate of @xmath31 hadron production  ) would be more appropriate for jets than for single - inclusive hadron production , but this is unimportant in this discussion .",
    "] in a  a collisions is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the corresponding rate in collisions and @xmath34 the energy loss probability distribution .",
    "taylor expanding @xmath33 in @xmath35 , the quenching factor reads to first order @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the probability for no energy loss .",
    "the index @xmath38 is the power - law exponent of the rate , which is a scaling function of @xmath17 ( up to qcd scaling violations ) , almost independent of @xmath17 at small @xmath17 and getting larger as @xmath17 goes to 1 ( see fig .  3 of  @xcite ) .",
    "its value depends on the slope of the ff into hadrons , consequently ( i ) the uncertainties on the ff at large @xmath23 ( thus on @xmath38 ) will translate into an uncertainty on @xmath6 , ( ii ) a stronger suppression in the baryon channel , e.g. @xmath39 , is in principle expected since the spectra of baryons are softer than that of mesons . apart from the dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath17 , @xmath6 depends on the _ fractional _ energy loss , @xmath40 . the important lever arm in @xmath1 at the lhc",
    "therefore allows for probing the energy dependence of @xmath41 .",
    "let us illustrate this by assuming that @xmath42 and fixing @xmath43  gev@xmath44 , as suggested by the first lhc measurements . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : raamodel ] ) and neglecting the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath38 , the `` predicted '' @xmath6 at @xmath45  gev would range from @xmath46 to @xmath47 when the parameter @xmath48 is varied from 0 to 1   leading to an effective exponent @xmath49 . ] .",
    "provided @xmath50 , note that @xmath51 at asymptotic energies @xmath52   with @xmath53 fixed ,",
    "i.e. the edge of phase - space is not reached . ] .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to measure the values of @xmath54 for which energy loss effects are negligible , i.e. @xmath55 , for various centralities in order to constrain the amount of energy lost in the medium .",
    "the large phase - space available at the lhc is also very satisfactory from a theoretical point of view as it allows for a better separation of the different energy scales involved in the process .",
    "the `` ideal playground '' for energy loss studies could be summarized as @xmath56 .",
    "the first inequality is likely to be fulfilled if the medium is dense or thick enough ; phenomenological estimates on the transport coefficient @xmath57 extracted at rhic indicate that it is actually the case .",
    "more problematic is the fact that the typical energy loss is of the order of the energy of the hard parton , @xmath58 , leading on average to a full stopping of the propagating parton and therefore to strong surface bias effects  @xcite .",
    "this is a severe limitation in particular at rhic for which transverse momenta are presently restricted to @xmath59  gev .",
    "the rightmost inequality is perhaps less crucial , yet it is likely to be responsible for the observed flatness of @xmath6 as a function of @xmath1 at rhic energies : as @xmath60 , the index @xmath61 gets larger and compensates the decrease of @xmath62 at large @xmath1 . at the lhc , this region is not probed unless hadrons are measured at forward rapidities , for which @xmath63 .",
    "the hadron quenching in heavy - ion collisions has now been observed at two different colliding energies , offering a promising possibility to understand further the underlying phenomena from a systematic comparison of rhic and lhc .",
    "one natural possibility is to compare @xmath6 at fixed @xmath1 and in the same centrality class , as the propagating partons would have typically the same energy and would cover the same medium length @xmath64 , despite the larger @xmath57 at lhc   is expected to be proportional to the particle density , and @xmath65  @xcite . ] .",
    "similarly one could also compare @xmath6 at fixed @xmath1 and particle density , leading to the same @xmath57 but different @xmath64 . finally ,",
    "comparing data at fixed @xmath17 would be interesting since the partonic slopes and npdf / saturation effects would be identical , yet parton energies would be rather different .",
    "there is a plethora of phenomenological studies on @xmath6 at rhic / lhc , mostly based on parton energy loss .",
    "the strategy usually followed can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "a general energy loss framework is chosen . to be schematic",
    ", one usually distinguishes the approaches in which propagating partons experience soft multiple scattering ( bdmps - asw & amy ) to the ones in which only few hard scatterings take place ( dglv & higher - twist ( ht ) ) .",
    "the bdmps - asw and dglv set - ups assume static scattering centers , while amy applies to thermal media .",
    "in the ht approach the amount of energy loss is related to the strength of quark - gluon correlations in the medium .",
    "additional work is then needed to treat _ multiple _ gluon emission , assuming independent ( poisson ) gluon emission ( bdmps - asw & dglv ) , solving rate equations ( amy ) or virtuality - ordered , dglap - like , evolution equations ( ht ) .",
    "comparing these frameworks quantitatively has been the goal of the techqm collaboration over the last few years  . for more details , see  @xcite ; 2 .   apart from radiative energy loss , other medium effects are sometimes implemented , e.g. collisional energy loss   which can be important at not too large @xmath1 and for heavy - quarks   or npdf effects ; 3 .",
    "additional assumptions are made regarding the produced medium and its hydrodynamical evolution . for a long time",
    "the medium expansion was described according to the simple bjorken model , i.e. a pure longitudinal expansion .",
    "more recently , energy loss models have been implemented into more sophisticated 2d ( w / o viscous corrections ) or 3d hydro evolution . in most studies ,",
    "the amount of energy loss is fixed at rhic and scaled up at the lhc according to the particle density .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : raadata ] are compared the preliminary cms data  @xcite with various model predictions , either based on bdmps - asw ( pqm  @xcite & renk  @xcite ) or dglv ( glv  @xcite & whdg  @xcite ) frameworks  .",
    "the bands indicate the uncertainties coming from the initial particle density assumed in each model . apart from pqm ,",
    "the various models predict a rising @xmath6 with @xmath1 in qualitative agreement with data . even though glv & whdg calculations best reproduce the magnitude of the data , no premature conclusion should be drawn at this stage regarding the other two predictions .",
    "extracted from cms data.,height=257 ]     extracted from cms data.,height=257 ]    as mentioned previously , the @xmath1 _ slope _ of @xmath6 at the lhc offers an interesting possibility to probe energy loss processes . on the contrary ,",
    "the _ magnitude _ of @xmath6 is useful in order to calibrate the strength of energy loss in the medium .",
    "for this reason , it might be worth considering also the logarithmic derivative of @xmath6 , @xmath66 which quantifies the slope of @xmath6 with @xmath1 and which is free of normalization uncertainties .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lograadata ] , where @xmath67 has been extracted from both data and theory  . ] .",
    "remarkably , the theoretical uncertainties shrink since the bands in fig .",
    "[ fig : raadata ] essentially reflect a normalization uncertainty on @xmath6 .",
    "this variable is thus very much independent on the _ amount _ of energy loss but tests the dynamics of energy loss models . at large @xmath68  gev , data and models ( including pqm ) agree .",
    "note also that @xmath67 is consistent with zero , indicating a flat behavior of @xmath6 in this @xmath1 domain . at lower @xmath1 , the model which describes best the data is whdg , while renk , glv and pqm tend to underpredict the slope of @xmath6 .",
    "this discussion is not meant to be comprehensive , but is rather an illustration of the potential usefulness of quantifying the slope of @xmath6 through eq .",
    "( [ eq : raaprime ] ) .",
    "since @xmath67 is dominated by statistical uncertainties ( unlike @xmath6 at small @xmath1 ) , @xmath67 is expected to become more precise as more data are collected .",
    "prompt photons have long been thought to be _ the _ ideal baseline measurement in heavy - ion collisions to which hadron production @xmath6 should be contrasted .",
    "they can be used to probe nuclear pdf  @xcite at not too large @xmath1 while at larger @xmath1 ( say , @xmath69  gev ) they offer a good test of binary collision scaling .",
    "however , it soon became clear that various hot medium effects could actually affect photon production in nuclear collisions  @xcite :    * jet - to - photon conversion , in which a produced high - energy parton converts all of its momentum to a photon by a rescattering in the medium ; * photon bremsstrahlung induced by parton multiple scattering in the medium ; * quenching of the fragmentation component , similar to the quenching of hadrons due to energy loss effects .",
    "both jet conversion and photon bremsstrahlung should _ enhance _ photon production leading to @xmath70  , @xmath6 should not be compared to unity since the neutrons in nuclei are less efficient to produce photons . ] and to negative second - fourier component , @xmath71 , in non - central collisions . on the contrary , one would expect @xmath72 and @xmath73 if fragmentation photons are quenched . also note that the last two effects would not show up when triggering on _ isolated _ photons , i.e. with little hadronic background in their vicinity . on the experimental side ,",
    "phenix has reported long ago on preliminary measurements of inclusive photon production au ",
    "au collisions  @xcite .",
    "these data are consistent with no medium effects within the uncertainties , yet they can not be excluded .",
    "hopefully the current situation will soon be clarified when final data come out .",
    "star also reported on photon anisotropies @xmath74 at large @xmath1  @xcite . at the lhc ,",
    "cms reported in this conference the first measurement of isolated photon production in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite , which is a remarkable achievement .",
    "the data are also consistent with @xmath75 although the present uncertainties are naturally rather large at this stage .",
    "instead of a conclusion , let me mention some open questions related to `` jet quenching '' studies and energy loss processes .",
    "regarding the theoretical frameworks themselves , efforts have been made to improve the current approximations , in particular including higher - order corrections and going beyond the soft and collinear limit in the calculation of medium - induced gluon spectrum  @xcite ( see also  @xcite and references therein ) . on a more phenomenological side",
    ", it would be important to clarify the role of collisional ( in contrast to radiative ) energy loss effects , in light of the recent lhc data .",
    "one surprise of the rhic data was the absence of proton quenching at rather small @xmath1 , whereas in pure energy loss scenarios one would expect a similar ( if not stronger ) quenching as that of mesons .",
    "it would be particularly interesting to observe the quenching of hadrons according to their ff slopes , a phenomenon observed e.g. in dis on nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the heavy - quark sector should also allow for a critical test of energy loss processes and the possible dead cone hierarchy , @xmath76  @xcite , which seems _ a priori _ challenged by the alice @xmath77-meson @xmath6  @xcite and by theoretical arguments  @xcite .",
    "the double ratio @xmath78 vs. @xmath1 should e.g. set stringent constraints on energy loss models .",
    "another challenge will be disentangle energy loss from possible saturation effects .",
    "the fact that the hadron quenching at mid - rapidity is similar at lhc than at rhic , despite @xmath17 values smaller by an order of magnitude , questions the strength of such saturation effects .",
    "hopefully future @xmath0pb data at lhc may soon clarify this question .    without a doubt , the large-@xmath1 hadron and photon measurements at the lhc presented at this conference   as well as that of rhic with unprecedented luminosities   are the first fruits of what will be another exciting decade of tomographic studies .",
