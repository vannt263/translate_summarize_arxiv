    "the classical digital geometry started with @xcite , where the authors defined the two basic neighbourhood relations on the square grid .",
    "the topic is well developed due to people of image processing and computer graphics communities . in @xcite the authors used the so - called neighbourhood sequences to vary the neighbourhood criterion in a path .",
    "they used only periodic neighbourhood sequences in their analysis .",
    "some properties of distances based on neighbourhood sequences are detailed in @xcite .",
    "the concept of neighbourhood sequences was extended to not necessarily periodic sequences in @xcite .",
    "these general neighbourhood sequences were analysed in @xcite , formulae to compute distances are presented in @xcite .",
    "one of the main problems of digital geometry is the approximation of the euclidean circle ( for instance in @xcite ) .",
    "it is the topic of the present paper as well .",
    "+ after the formal definitions ( section 2 ) some previous results on the topic are recalled ( section 3 ) .",
    "the approximations of the circle by neighbourhood sequences ( i.e. the digital discs ) are octagons .",
    "the descriptors of these octagons are presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    "several approaches of approximation are detailed , in section 6 a detailed example is shown , while in section 7 we summarize the results .",
    "finally a conclusion closes the paper .",
    "our aim is to provide the best approximation of a circle with a given radius using neighbourhood sequences . in order to formulate our results",
    ", we have to recall the following definitions @xcite . because a circle is a planar shape , we restrict our considerations to two dimensions .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be two points in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath4th coordinate of the point @xmath0 is indicated by @xmath5 .",
    "the points @xmath0 and @xmath1 are _ @xmath6-neighbours in two dimensions _ if the following two conditions hold :    * @xmath7 @xmath8 , * @xmath9",
    ".    @xmath10-neighbourhood corresponds to the classical @xmath11-neighbourhood and @xmath12-neighbourhood to @xmath13-neighbourhood , as it can be seen on fig . 1 left and right , respectively . in two dimensions , @xmath6-neighbourhood means that we can step along at most @xmath6 cartesian axes to reach a neighbour .",
    "+    in a neighbourhood sequence one can give a sequence of neighbourhoods , in which a @xmath6-neighbourhood is represented by the number @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath4th element of such a sequence defines the neighbourhood we can use as we take the @xmath4th step going further and further from the starting point . formally in the @xmath14 dimensional digital space the neighbourhood sequences are defined in the following way :    the infinite sequence @xmath15 , where @xmath16 for all @xmath17 , is called a _ generalized @xmath14d - neighbourhood sequence_.    in @xmath2 , neighbourhood sequences are infinite sequences of values @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",
    "now we can define the path leading from one point to another , its length , and the distance between two points .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be two points in @xmath2 and @xmath18 a generalized @xmath12d - neighbourhood sequence . the point sequence @xmath19 - which has the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are @xmath23-neighbours for @xmath24 - is called a _ path from @xmath0 to @xmath1 determined by @xmath18_. the _ length @xmath25 of the path _",
    "@xmath19 is @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be two points in @xmath2 and @xmath18 a generalized @xmath12d - neighbourhood sequence .",
    "the / a shortest path from @xmath0 to @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "the _ distance between @xmath0 and @xmath1 _ is defined as the length of the minimal path , and is written as @xmath28    as one can see , neighbourhood sequences occupy digital octagons after every step ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . this means , that if we use neighbourhood sequences on the square grid , the only shape we can use to approximate circles are special octagons , having @xmath29 inner angles @xcite , or squares with right angles in degenerated cases .",
    "the octagon is degenerated if only 1 type of neighbourhood is used to generate it . on fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , we can see two discs with a radius of 4 , generated by the neighbourhood sequences @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . on the figures ,",
    "each point of the digital discs is indicated by a number , which is the distance of the point from the center point with the given sequence .",
    "in @xcite hajdu and nagy used the isoperimetric ratio ( @xcite ) to approximate the euclidean circle .",
    "we call @xmath32 the _ isoperimetric ratio _ of the shape , where @xmath33 is the perimeter , and @xmath34 is the area of the shape .    in @xcite and @xcite the isoperimetric ratio is referred as",
    "_ noncompactness ratio_.    in euclidean geometry , according to the isoperimetric inequality , the isoperimetric ratio is never less than @xmath35 , and is minimal for the circle .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the number of value @xmath10 in the neighbourhood sequence @xmath18 , and @xmath37 the number of value @xmath12 .",
    "the number of steps we take in the neighbourhood sequence @xmath18 will be denoted by @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 denote the proportional frequency of value 2 in the sequence , thus @xmath41 .",
    "the isoperimetric ratio for the convex hull of the possible octagons can be written in the form @xmath42    it turns out that @xmath43 is minimal at @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath40 satisfies this equality , the convex hull of the pixel centers becomes a regular octagon , thus the problem of approximating the circle turns out to be the problem of approximating the regular octagon .",
    "note that because of the irrationality of @xmath45 , @xmath40 can only be equal to this in the ideal case of @xmath46 . for any @xmath47",
    "there is a value of @xmath48 such that for any @xmath49  @xmath50 .",
    "let us remark that the use of the isoperimetric ratio can be avoided .",
    "taking into consideration the connection between the isoperimetric ratio and the isoperimetric problem , we can say that hajdu and nagy solved the isoperimetric problem for the corresponding octagons in their approximations on the square grid .",
    "the proof is much easier if we solve the isoperimetric problem directly for these octagons .",
    "further in this article we take into account the circle s isoperimetric property by restricting our examinations only to regular octagons .",
    "this can only be achieved if we assume that the approximating octagon is large enough to have more than one value 1 and 2 in its sequence @xmath51 .",
    "hajdu and nagy also gave the sequence which in every step generates the octagon closest to the regular octagon .",
    "in this paper we use a different approach .",
    "we assume that we have a circle with a particular radius @xmath52 .",
    "we want to determine the sequence that leads to the best approximating regular octagon .",
    "we can also approximate circles with positive real radius , which could not be done by using the old approach .",
    "we use different measures to describe the generated octagons , which we will call _ ` descriptors'_. we also investigate several possible definitions for ` approximation ' .",
    "the sequence - generated octagons can be easily described by their sidelengths @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( see fig .",
    "we use three types of measure to give the length of the sides : the pixel , the inner convex hull ( or inner octagon ) and the outer convex hull ( or outer octagon ) based descriptors .    _",
    "pixel based descriptors : _ @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given in pixels . as it can be seen on fig .",
    "3 , we assume that corner pixels belong to the horizontal sides ( @xmath53 ) .    _",
    "inner octagon : _ in this case , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are equal to the corresponding sides of the convex hull of the centers of the pixels .",
    "_ outer octagon : _ the same as the inner octagon , except that we use the convex hull of the pixels as squares .",
    "table 1 shows the values for the sides , the perimeter and the area of the octagons . +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     _ table 5 .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath55 expressed by the radius @xmath52 in various approximations",
    "_    we can choose the used descriptor and approximation method depending on our aim .",
    "for example , if we would like to have an exact number of pixels from a given distance of a center point , we shall use pixel descriptors with perimeter based approximation . if we would like to clusterize a plane with neighbourhood sequence generated discs , and we need clusters with fixed area , we shall use a convex hull descriptor ( it makes no real difference whether we use the inner or the outer octagon ) with area based approximation .",
    "the other approximations can be useful in visual applications , and their results can be more easily forecast , since we often work with the radius and the curve of the shapes when we imagine geometric ideas .",
    "the presented approximations work not only with integer radii ( opposite to the previous papers , in which the best approximating neighbourhood sequence is computed to provide best approximation for the sequence of circles with integer radii ) .",
    "an example is shown for radius 50.7 .",
    "similarly , for any non - negative real radius one can compute the best approximation with our formulae . the digital discs and our formulae are useful for distance transforms , segmentation by colour clusterization and other algorithms in image processing .",
    "a discussion of a three dimensional approximation is provided in @xcite , but the extension of most approaches of the problem to three and more dimensions is a matter of future research .",
    "there are some related results on the triangular grid ( @xcite ) and in three dimensions on the face - centered and on the body - centered cubic grids ( @xcite ) .",
