    "the supermassive black - hole in the center of the milky way , located in the radio source sgr  a * , is one of the most interesting astronomical objects : see ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive review .",
    "it is now in a state of relative inactivity  @xcite but there is no good reason for it to be stationary .",
    "e.g. , there are interesting hints for a much stronger emission few 100 years ago @xcite ; on the time scale of 40,000 years , major variability episodes are expected  @xcite ; fermi bubbles @xcite could be visible manifestations @xcite of its intense activity . therefore , it is reasonable to expect that a past emission from the galactic center leads to observable effects .",
    "such scenario was recently considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the latest observations by the h.e.s.s .  observatory @xcite , that various regions around sgr  a * emit @xmath0-rays till many tens of tev , are offering us new occasions to investigate this object .",
    "these @xmath0-rays obey non - thermal distributions , which are moreover different in the closest vicinity of sgr  a * and in its outskirts . in the latter case ,",
    "the @xmath0-rays seem to extend till very high energies ( @xmath2 tev ) without a perceivable cut - off .",
    "the @xmath0-rays seen by h.e.s.s .  can be attributed to cosmic ray collisions @xcite .",
    "this is a likely hypothesis , but the proof of its correctness requires neutrino telescopes . in this connection , it is essential to derive reliable predictions for the search of a neutrino signal from sgr  a * and its surroundings , and h.e.s.s .",
    "observations are very valuable in this respect .",
    "remarkably , the possibility that the galactic centre is a significant neutrino source is discussed since the first works  @xcite and it is largely within expectations : indeed sgr  a * is one of the main point source targets , already for the icecube observatory  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we discuss the implications of the findings of h.e.s.s . , briefly reviewed in sect .",
    "[ sec : gammaray ] , where we also explain our assumptions on the @xmath0-ray spectra at the source .",
    "the effect of @xmath0-ray absorption ( due to the known radiation fields or to new ones , close to the galactic center ) is examined in details in sect .  [",
    "sec : abs ] .",
    "the expected signal in neutrino telescopes , evaluated at the best of the present knowledge , is shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : ripu ] and it is quantified in sect .  [",
    "sec : rates ] , while sect .",
    "[ sec : ccc ] is devoted for the conclusion .",
    "we argue that the pevatron hypothesis makes the case for a cubic kilometer class neutrino telescope , located in the northern hemisphere , more compelling than ever .",
    "the excess of vhe @xmath0-rays reported by the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration @xcite comes from two regions around the galactic center : a point source ( hess j1745 - 290 ) , identified by a circular region centered on the radio source sgr  a * with a radius of 0.1@xmath3 , and a diffuse emission , coming from an annulus with inner and outer radii of 0.15@xmath3 and 0.45@xmath3 respectively .",
    "the observed spectrum from the point source is described by a cut - off power law distribution , as @xmath4 while in the case of diffuse emission an unbroken power law is preferred ; in the last case , however , also cut - off power law fits are presented , as expected from standard mechanisms of particle acceleration into the galaxy .",
    "the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration has summarised its observations by means of the following parameter sets :    * best fit of the point source ( ps ) region : + @xmath5 , + @xmath6 tev@xmath7 @xmath8 s@xmath7 , + @xmath9 tev ; * best fit of the diffuse ( d ) region : + @xmath10 , + @xmath11",
    "tev@xmath7 @xmath8 s@xmath7 ;    the best - fits of both the diffuse and the point source emission are shown in fig .",
    "[ figabs ] , right panel .",
    "however , in order to predict the neutrino spectrum , the @xmath0-ray spectrum at the source  i.e . the emission spectrum  is needed .",
    "we will discuss the implication of the assumption that the emitted spectra coincide with the observed spectra as described by the previous functional forms and furthermore we will discuss the assumption that the @xmath0-ray emission at the source is described by different model parameters , namely :    * point source emission with an increased value of the cut - off ( ps * ) : + @xmath12 , + @xmath13 tev@xmath7 @xmath8 s@xmath7 , + @xmath14 tev ; * diffuse emission as a cut - off ( dc ) power law with : + @xmath15 , + @xmath16 tev@xmath7 @xmath8 s@xmath7 , + @xmath17 pev .",
    "the interest in considering an _ increased _ value of the cut - off ( the case ps * ) , that is the only case that differs significantly from the spectra observed by h.e.s.s .",
    ", is motivated in the next section .",
    "instead , the inclusion of a cut - off for the emission from the diffuse region agrees with the observations of h.e.s.s .  and is motivated simply by the expectation of a maximum energy available for particle acceleration .",
    "note that the @xmath0-ray observations extend till 20 - 40 tev .",
    "this is an important region of energy but it covers only the lower region that is relevant for neutrinos : the latter one extends till 100 tev , as clear e.g. , from fig.2 and 3 of  @xcite and fig.1 of @xcite . in other words , it should be kept in mind that until @xmath0-ray observations till few 100 tev will become available  thanks to future measurements by hawc @xcite and cta @xcite  the expectations for neutrinos will rely in part on extrapolation and/or on theoretical modeling . in this work , unless stated otherwise , we rely on a ` minimal extrapolation ' , assuming that the above functional descriptions of the @xmath0-ray spectrum are valid descriptions of the emission spectrum .    a precise upper limit on the expected neutrino flux can be determined from the h.e.s.s .",
    "measurement , assuming a hadronic origin of the observed @xmath0-rays .",
    "the presence of a significant leptonic component of the @xmath0-rays would imply a smaller neutrino flux . in principle , however , also other regions close the the galactic center , but not probed by h.e.s.s .",
    ", could emit high - energy @xmath0-rays and neutrino radiation , leading to an interesting signal .",
    "one reason is that the annulus , chosen by h.e.s.s .  for the analysis , resembles more a region selected for observational purposes rather than an object with an evident physical meaning ; another reason is that the ice - based neutrino telescope icecube integrates on an angular extension of about @xmath18 , which is 5 times larger than the angular region covered in @xcite . in view of these reasons ,",
    "the theoretical upper limit on the neutrino flux that we will derive is the _ minimum _ that is justified by the current @xmath0-ray data .",
    "moreover , there is also a specific phenomenon that increases the expected neutrino flux that can be derived from the @xmath0-ray flux currently measured by h.e.s.s . :",
    "this is the absorption of @xmath0-rays from non standard radiation fields , as discussed in the next section .",
    "during their propagation in the background radiation fields of the milky way , high - energy photons are subject to absorption .",
    "consider the _ observed _ @xmath0-ray spectrum , as summarized by means of a certain functional form .",
    "the corresponding _ emission _ spectrum is larger : this is obtained modeling and then removing the effect of absorption ( de - absorption ) .",
    "the neutrino spectrum corresponds to the emission spectrum , and thus it is larger than the one obtained by converting the observed @xmath0-ray spectrum instead .",
    "note that the idea that the @xmath0-rays could suffer significant absorption already at h.e.s.s .",
    "energies was put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here , we examine it in details .      the existence of a cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , that pervades the whole space and it is uniformly distributed , is universally known ; this leads to absorption of @xmath0-rays of very high energies , around pev . for what concerns the interstellar radiation background , the model by porter et al .",
    "@xcite , adopted e.g. , in the galprop simulation program @xcite , can be conveniently used to describe @xmath0-ray absorption due to the infrared ( ir ) and starlight ( sl ) backgrounds ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , that occurs at lower energies .",
    "it is convenient to group these three radiation fields ( for instance cmb , ir and sl ) as ` known ' radiation fields , since it is not possible to exclude that in the vicinity of the galactic center new intense ir fields exist , and thus we should be ready to consider also hypothetical or ` unknown ' radiation fields .",
    "the formal description of their absorption effects can be simplified without significant loss of accuracy if the radiation background field is effectively parameterized in terms of a sum of thermal and quasi - thermal distributions , where the latter ones are just proportional to thermal distributions .    for the @xmath19-th component of the radiation background ,",
    "two parameters are introduced : the temperature @xmath20 and the coefficient of proportionality to the thermal distribution , that we call the ` non - thermic parameter ' and that we denote by @xmath21 .",
    "the reliability of this procedure for the description of the galactic absorption was already tested in @xcite .",
    "we found that the formalism can be simplified even further without significant loss of accuracy thanks to a fully analytical ( albeit approximate ) formula , derived and discussed in details in the appendix .",
    "we have checked the excellent consistency with the other approach  based on  @xcite  by comparing our results with fig.3 of  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize a few advantages of this procedure , + 1 )  the results are exact in the case of the cmb distribution , that is a thermal distribution ; + 2 )  such a procedure allows one to vary the parameters of the radiation field very easily , discussing the effect of errors and uncertainties ; + 3 ) the very same formalism allow us to model the effect of new hypothetical radiation background .",

    "the probability that it will reach the earth is @xmath23\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the opacity . in the interstellar medium ,",
    "different radiation fields can offer a target to astrophysical photons and determine their absorption : the total opacity is therefore the sum of various contributions , @xmath25 where the index @xmath19 indicates the components of the background radiation field that causes absorption .",
    "these include the cmb , as well as the ir and sl backgrounds , and possibly new ones , present near the region of the galactic center .",
    ".values of the parameters of the background radiation fields used for the computation of the absorption factor of the @xmath0-rays from the galactic center : the black body temperature @xmath20 , the non - thermic parameter @xmath21 , the typical length @xmath26 ( namely the distance of the galactic center for cmb and the exponential scales for the ir and sl radiation fields ) the total density of photons @xmath27 ( obtained from eq .",

    "the function @xmath30 if @xmath31 ; on the contrary , when @xmath32 , it diverges like @xmath33 .",
    "the divergence is compensated by the behavior of the function @xmath34 , that follows from @xmath35 at high values of @xmath36 . finally , @xmath37 at small values of @xmath36 .    at this point , we study the behaviour of @xmath38 in @xmath39 : + for high @xmath39 we can consider only the first term of the expansion of @xmath34 , so the function @xmath38 is well approximated by : @xmath40 within an accuracy of 1% for @xmath41 . + for small @xmath39 the most important contribution to the integral is given when the @xmath42 diverges and the @xmath34 is not exponentially suppressed .",
    "this condition is realized when @xmath43 and in this region @xmath44 ; for @xmath42 we can use the asymptotic expression , i.e. @xmath45 . the approximation of the function @xmath46 ) is given by : @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
