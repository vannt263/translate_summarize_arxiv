    "in the last few years there has been a considerable interest in a possible failure of the lorentz symmetry , suggested both by theoretical speculations and by experimental observations .",
    "it has also been proposed @xcite that the relativity principle and the lorentz symmetry are valid , but the action of the lorentz group on the components of the energy - momentum is `` deformed '' and is not linear any more .",
    "more references and a more detailed discussion are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we present some mathematical tools useful for the discussion of the above mentioned problems .",
    "they are simple mathematical exercises , but it is not easy to find an explicit and compact treatment of them in the literature . the physical relevance of some results is discussed in a shorter forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to consider a set of classical physical observables as continuous coordinates in an abstract topological space @xmath0 .",
    "this is also possible in a quantum treatment if the observables are compatible .",
    "they are described by commuting self - adjoint operators which generate an abelian @xmath1 algebra , which , according to a theorem by gelfand @xcite , is isomorphic to an algebra of continuous functions defined on a locally compact space @xmath0 .",
    "also in the classical case the observables generate an abelian @xmath1 algebra , and we assume in general that @xmath0 is locally compact",
    ".    the symmetry group @xmath2 , which is a lie group @xcite or , at least , a topological group @xcite , acts continuously on @xmath0 and we indicate this action by the notation @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "of course , we have @xmath6 .",
    "we are not assuming that @xmath0 is a vector space and it is not even meaningful to say that the action of @xmath2 is or is not linear .",
    "we begin by recalling some important definitions and results .",
    "if there is another space @xmath7 on which @xmath2 acts continuously , a continuous mapping @xmath8 is called _ covariant _ ( or equivariant ) if it commutes with the action of the group , namely if @xmath9 .",
    "the action of @xmath2 defines on @xmath0 an equivalence relation and the equivalence classes are the _ orbits_. two points @xmath10 belong to the same orbit if @xmath11 with @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath0 is composed of a single orbit , we say that the action of @xmath2 is _",
    "transitive_. this happens in many physical problems , in particular the problem which has motivated this research . in the other cases it is always possible to decompose @xmath0 into orbits on which @xmath2 acts transitively . in the following",
    "we assume that the action of @xmath2 on @xmath0 is transitive .",
    "we choose an element @xmath5 and we indicate by @xmath12 the corresponding _ stabilizer subgroup _ defined by the condition @xmath13 .",
    "it is a closed subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "we see immediately that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the points of @xmath0 and the cosets which form the quotient space @xmath14 .",
    "one defines in a natural way a topology and a continuous action of @xmath2 on this space which it is called a ( topological ) _ homogeneous space_.    the bijective mapping @xmath15 is continuous and covariant , but the inverse mapping is not necessarily continuous . in order to simplify the discussion ,",
    "we replace the topology of @xmath0 by a finer topology in such a way that @xmath14 and @xmath0 are omeomorphic .",
    "physically , this means to admit a larger class of continuous observables . with this topology , @xmath0",
    "too is called a topological homogeneous space . note that if @xmath2 is locally compact , @xmath0 is locally compact too , in agreement with the assumption justified above .",
    "we say that two homogeneous spaces ( with respect to the same group ) are _ isomorphic _ if they are connected by an covariant continuous mapping with continuous inverse .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 is isomorphic to @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath11 , its stabilizer is @xmath16 , namely the two stabilizers are _ conjugated_. the homogeneous spaces @xmath14 and @xmath17 are isomorphic and it follows that , in order to classify all the homogeneous spaces of @xmath2 up to isomorphisms , it is sufficient to classify all its closed subgroups up to conjugation .    in our case , @xmath2 is a lie group and its closed subgroups , in particular the stabilizer @xmath12 , are lie groups too @xcite .",
    "the homogeneous space @xmath14 has a structure of analytic manifold , which can be transmitted to @xmath0 .",
    "note that if the subgroups @xmath18 and @xmath12 are conjugate , namely @xmath16 , the corresponding lie subalgebras @xmath19 and @xmath20 are conjugated too , namely we have @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the adjoint representation of @xmath2 .",
    "then , the first step is to classify all the subalgebras of the lie algebra @xmath23 of @xmath2 up to conjugation .",
    "each lie subalgebra @xmath20 determines uniquely a connected lie subgroup @xmath12 and the most general lie subgroup is obtained by adding to this connected subgroup other connected components .    in the following sections we carry out this program for the group @xmath24 ( considered as a real lie group ) , locally isomorphic to the proper orthochronous lorentz group @xmath25 .",
    "we note that an homogeneous space of @xmath26 is also an homogeneous space of @xmath25 if the stabiblizer @xmath12 contains the central element @xmath27",
    "now we have to classify , up to conjugation , all the lie subalgebras of @xmath28 .",
    "we introduce a basis composed of the generators of the rotations @xmath29 and the generators of the lorentz boosts @xmath30 ( @xmath31 , which satisfy the familiar commutation relations @xmath32 = \\epsilon_{rst }",
    "m_t , \\qquad [ m_r , l_s ] = \\epsilon_{rst } l_t , \\qquad [ l_r , l_s ] = - \\epsilon_{rst } m_t.\\ ] ] a generic element of @xmath23 can be written in the form @xmath33    the adjoint representation of @xmath24 is equivalent to the representation which acts on the antisymmetric second order tensors .",
    "it acts on the lie algebra @xmath23 , which can be decomposed into orbits of conjugate elements .",
    "the following two quantities are lorentz - invariant and are therefore constant on the orbits @xmath34    it is easy to show that every non - vanishing element of @xmath23 can be lorentz transformed into one of the following forms , which provide representative elements of the orbits : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 the elements belonging to the last orbit , defined by @xmath39 , are called _ nilpotent _ , because some power of the corresponding operator of the adjoint representation vanishes .",
    "the other elements are called _ semisimple _ , because , as we shall see , the corresponding operators of the adjoint representation are semisimple .",
    "all these orbits are four - dimensional and we shall describe them with more detail in section 4 .",
    "we also obtain the following classification , up to conjugation , of the zero and one - dimensional subalgebras :    1 .",
    "@xmath40 , containing only the zero element ; 2 .",
    "@xmath41 , ( @xmath42 ) , generated by the element @xmath43 ; 3 .",

    "@xmath46 , generated by the element @xmath47 ; 5 .",
    "@xmath48 , generated by the nilpotent element @xmath49 .",
    "the subscript is the codimension of the algebra , equal to the dimension of the corresponding homogeneous space .",
    "the next step is to find ( up to conjugation ) all the subalgebras composed exclusively of nilpotent elements , besides @xmath48 .",
    "we may assume that one element is given by @xmath49 and we write the generic element in the form @xmath50 this element must be nilpotent for any value of @xmath51 and it follows that @xmath52 @xmath53 with some calculations , we obtain @xmath54 and we have @xmath55 these elements form a commutative two - dimensional lie subalgebra , which we add to our list :    1 .",
    "@xmath56 , generated by the elements @xmath49 and @xmath57 .",
    "all the other subalgebras contain at least a semisimple element and we may assume that it has the form @xmath58 .",
    "we consider the corresponding operator @xmath59 of the adjoint representation defined by @xmath60 , \\qquad a \\in \\mathbf{g}.\\ ] ] as we have anticipated above , this operator is semisimple , namely we can introduce a basis in the complexification @xmath61 of @xmath23 in which it is diagonal .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67    the subspace @xmath20 and its complexification @xmath68 must be invariant under the operator @xmath59 and in @xmath68 there is a basis composed of eigenvectors of @xmath59 , chosen among the eigenvectors listed above . since we want to build a real basis , every complex eigenvector must be chosen together with its complex conjugate . if there are degenerate eigenvalues , a linear superposition of the corresponding eigenvectors can be chosen . in this way",
    "we easily classify all the invariant subspaces",
    ". then we have to check if they are subalgebras .",
    "we consider first the case in which @xmath20 contains both the elements @xmath45 and @xmath47 and therefore also @xmath58 with an arbitrary choice of the coefficients .",
    "the complex eigenvalues are not degenerate and we may choose zero , one or two pairs of complex eigenvectors , obtaining the subalgebras    1 .",

    "@xmath71 .    by choosing the second pair of complex eigenvectors instead of the first",
    ", we obtain a conjugate subalgebra .",
    "then we assume that only the linear superposition @xmath58 belongs to @xmath20 and that the coefficients do not vanish .",
    "we may assume @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "in this case too , the complex eigenvalues are not degenerate and we may choose one or two pairs of complex eigenvectors .",

    "another possibility is that @xmath72 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "then the pairs of complex eigenvalues are degenerate and one can choose a pair of eigenvectors belongoing to two - dimensional vector spaces , namely @xmath77 and its complex conjugate .",
    "these vector spaces can not be entirely contained in @xmath20 , otherwise we obtain @xmath78 . for the same reason , we must have @xmath79 and we may assume that @xmath80 and @xmath81 are real .",
    "this expression can be simplified by means of a boost generated by @xmath47 , which acts in the following way : @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 this transformation permits us to consider only three special cases , namely @xmath85 , @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "we obtain in this way the following subalgebras , which correspond to the _ little groups",

    "@xmath94 , generated by the elements @xmath45 , @xmath49 , and @xmath57 .",
    "the last possibility is that @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 . since the eigenvalues of @xmath59 are real , it is not necessary to introduce the complexification of @xmath23 and to choose pairs of conjugate eigenvectors .",
    "the eigenvalues are degenerate and we have to consider the following two - dimensional spaces of eigenvectors @xmath98 @xmath99 in order to avoid the appearance of @xmath45 in @xmath20 , we must have @xmath100 .",
    "this equality implies that one can not choose more that two independent eigenvectors .",
    "we may choose two independent eigenvectors in the first vector space or only one of them , which , by means of a rotation generated by @xmath45 , can be transformed into an element proportial to @xmath49 .",
    "we obtain in this way the following subalgebras    1 .",

    "we may also choose an element in the first and another element in the second vector space and by means of a rotation we can set @xmath85 .",
    "the constraint given above implies @xmath103 and we obtain a subalgebra generated by @xmath47 , @xmath89 and @xmath93 , conjugate to the subalgebra @xmath104 , which has already been considered .",
