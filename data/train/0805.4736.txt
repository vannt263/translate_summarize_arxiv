    "we have been conducting an all - sky survey for stars with large proper motions using data from the digitized sky surveys ( dss ) .",
    "the scanned images in the dss cover the entire sky in multiple bands and at various epochs , and the temporal baseline between the earliest and latest epoch is between 15 and 45 years for most areas on the sky .",
    "the large motion displayed by high proper motion stars between the two epochs is detected directly from the scans by means of an image subtraction algorithm , described in detail in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lpine ( 2002 ) ) .",
    "two - epochs finder charts are generated , which can be blinked on the computer screen .",
    "all objects detected in the survey are thus verified by eye , and spurious detections are excluded .    at the bright end , stars tend to become saturated on the dss images , and are no longer properly detected by the code .",
    "the tycho-2 catalog is used to complete the census at the bright end .",
    "also , all stars detected by superblink are searched for a counterpart in the tycho-2 .",
    "the positional and proper motion information from the tycho-2 catalog are used for all matching counterparts .",
    "the two - epoch charts are however examined to verify consistency ; in some cases , it is found that the proper motion from tycho-2 must be in error , and the superblink proper motion is used instead .",
    "counterparts in the the 2mass all - sky catalog of point sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cutri ( 2003 ) ) are also identified for all superblink detections . at the faint end ,",
    "the positions are thus those extrapolated from the 2mass catalog , and are thus realized in the icrs system and accurate to about 0.1  .",
    "counterpart are also identified in the usno - b1 catalog ( * ? ? ?",
    "* monet ( 2003 ) ) , and together with 2mass , provide optical and infrared magnitudes for almost all the stars .",
    "the systematic comparison with the 2mass catalog allows allows us to systematically identify all common proper motion doubles which are resolved in the 2mass images .",
    "the ccd observations from 2mass have significantly higher resolution than the photographic images from the dss .",
    "numerous common proper motion doubles and multiple systems have being identified and their components will be listed as separate entries in the lspm catalog .",

    "stars from the nltt catalog ( top ) and the new lspm catalog ( bottom ) .",
    "the new catalog fills in all the gaps of the nltt , particularly in the low galactic latitude fields , and provides the most complete all - sky census of high proper motion stars to date.,width=480 ]",
    "the nltt catalog ( * ? ? ? * luyten ( 1979 ) ) was notoriously incomplete in two main regions : the sky south of decl.=-30@xmath4 , and areas of high stellar density along the plane of the milky way .",
    "the incompleteness was most severe for stars fainter than magnitude v=16 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the northern part of the superblink survey was completed first , and the results have already been published in ( * ? ? ? * lpine & shara(2005 ) ) as the lspm - north catalog .",
    "the full lspm catalog now fills in most of the remaining gaps in the south , and at last provides a true , all - sky census of faint stars with large proper motions ( fig.1 ) .",
    "while there remains some level of incompleteness at low galactic latitudes , especially toward the galactic center , most of the variations in surface density observed in fig.1 are due to selection effects from the high proper motion cutoff ( @xmath0 yr@xmath1 ) of the survey . a combination of the sun s motion through the local standard of rest and the asymmetric drift of the galactic thick disk and halo stars results in more stars having large transverse motions at high galactic latitudes , hence the large density of stars detected there .",
    "compared with the 58,845 stars with proper motions @xmath5 yr@xmath1 listed in the nltt catalog , the lspm catalog will list over 122,000 stars with proper motions @xmath5 yr@xmath1 . with the increased sky coverage and completeness",
    ", the lspm catalog makes the luyten catalog obsolete , and from now on should be used as a replacement to the nltt . for convenience",
    ", all nltt stars will also be identified in the lspm both by their lhs designation and nltt catalog number .",
    "a reduced proper motion diagram shows the stars in the lspm to be of three main classes .",
    "low - mass k and m red dwarfs from the disk population dominate , but a significant fraction are low - mass subdwarfs from the halo ( sdk , sdm ) , and the catalog also contains thousands of white dwarfs .",
    "while we currently lack parallax distances for most of the stars in the lspm catalog , photometric distances can be calculated for specific classes of objects .",
    "the red dwarfs , in particular , have a reasonably well calibrated @xmath6 $ ] color - magnitude relationship ( * ? ? ? * lpine ( 2005 ) ) .    with photometric distances and proper motions ,",
    "it is possible to investigate the local kinematics of the red dwarfs in the vicinity of the sun ( @xmath7pc ) . by selecting stars is specific parts of the sky , one can obtain velocity - space projections in the uv , uw , and vw plane ( figure 2 ) . because of the high proper motion cutoff of the lspm catalog ( @xmath0 yr@xmath1 , stars with low projected velocities",
    "are not represented in the census , which leaves a low - velocity `` hole '' in the maps of projected velocities .",
    "the hole increases for stars at larger distances . despite this artifact",
    ", one can see that the velocity space projections of the nearby red dwarfs are not isotropic and show considerable structure . a comparison with the velocity space distribution of hipparcos stars calculated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nordstrm ( 2004 ) ) , shows very good agreement with our data .",
    "this show how future astrometry , providing accurate parallaxes for all the lspm stars , may have a major impact in uncovering fine structure in the kinematics of stars in the solar vicinity .",
    "the lspm catalog now has all - sky coverage .",
    "the lspm - south catalog will complement the already released lspm - north , and yield a highly complete catalog of stars with proper motion @xmath8 yr@xmath1 .",
    "the catalog is estimated to be @xmath2 complete for all h - burning stars and white dwarfs with proper motions in the range above , covering virtually all objects down to visual magnitude 19 .",
    "the catalog is realized at the bright end by the tycho-2 catalog , down to magnitude @xmath9 . at the faint end , which encompass the vast majority of the stars , the proper motions are obtained from the superblink software , while the positions are determined by the counterparts in the 2mass catalog .",
    "overall , the positional accuracy of the catalog is thus better than @xmath10 , while proper motions at the faint end have typical errors @xmath11 mas yr@xmath1 north of decl.=-30@xmath4 , and @xmath12 mas yr@xmath1 south of this .",
    "all double stars which are resolved in the 2mass survey have been identified and are listed individually ."
