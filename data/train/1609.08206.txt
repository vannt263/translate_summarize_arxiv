    "in a rocking ratchet , a particle or collection of particles interacting with an asymmetric substrate undergoes a net dc drift when subjected to an ac drive @xcite , as observed for vortices in type - ii superconductors interacting with one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xcite or two - dimensional ( 2d ) asymmetric substrates @xcite . in the single particle limit ,",
    "the ratchet motion is typically in the easy flow direction of the substrate asymmetry ; however , when collective effects come into play , it is possible for a reverse ratchet effect to occur in which the particles move along the opposite or hard flow direction of the substrate asymmetry .",
    "reversals of the ratchet direction can occur when parameters such as the ac amplitude , particle density , or substrate strength are varied @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to observe a transverse ratchet effect in which the net dc drift of the particles is perpendicular to applied ac drive . for such transverse ratchets ,",
    "when the ac drive is applied transverse to the substrate asymmetry direction , the resulting dc drift is parallel to the substrate asymmetry in either the easy or hard flow direction @xcite .    in many of the experimentally studied systems where ratchet effects occur , such as vortices in type - ii superconductors @xcite or colloids @xcite , the motion of the particles is effectively overdamped . recently a new particlelike excitation called skyrmions was discovered in chiral magnets @xcite .",
    "these skyrmions have many similarities to vortices in type - ii superconductors in that they exhibit particlelike properties and have a mutually repulsive interaction that leads to the formation of a triangular skyrmion lattice @xcite .",
    "skyrmions can be driven with an applied current @xcite and exhibit pinning - depinning phenomena @xcite .",
    "a key difference between superconducting vortex and skyrmion systems is that in addition to the damping , skyrmion motion involves a strong non - dissipative magnus effect which rotates the skyrmion velocity into the direction perpendicular to the net applied external forces .",
    "this magnus term can be ten or more times larger than the damping term @xcite . in the absence of pinning , under a dc drive",
    "the magnus effect causes the skyrmions to move at an angle , the skyrmion hall angle @xmath1 , with respect to the driving direction , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the ratio of the magnus term to the damping term . in the presence of pinning ,",
    "the skyrmion hall angle has a strong drive dependence @xcite .",
    "skyrmions have now been stabilized at room temperature @xcite making them promising candidates for a variety of spintronic applications @xcite , any of which would require the ability to precisely control the skyrmion motion .",
    "one method for achieving such control would be to exploit ratchet effects .    in previous numerical work",
    ", it was shown that an individual skyrmion in a 2d system interacting with a quasi-1d asymmetric substrate exhibits a rocking ratchet effect when the ac drive is applied along the substrate asymmetry direction @xcite . in this case , the resulting dc skyrmion velocity has components both parallel and perpendicular to the substrate asymmetry direction due to the magnus term .",
    "a new type of ratchet effect , called a magnus ratchet , was shown to occur when the ac drive is applied perpendicular to the substrate asymmetry direction @xcite . here",
    ", the magnus term induces skyrmion velocity components both parallel and perpendicular to the ac drive . as a result ,",
    "the skyrmions translate partially along the substrate asymmetry direction , permitting ratcheting motion to occur . in the overdamped limit , this magnus ratchet effect is lost . in the single skyrmion limit for both longitudinal and transverse ac driving , the ratchet flux is always aligned with the easy flow direction of the substrate asymmetry , so an open question is whether it is possible to realize a reversible skyrmion ratchet effect .    in this work",
    "we consider skyrmions driven by ac forces over gradient pinning arrays .",
    "previous studies of such arrays in the overdamped limit for superconducting vortices demonstrated that both longitudinal and transverse ratchet effects as well as ratchet reversals occur as a function of ac amplitude and vortex density @xcite .",
    "here we show that for ac drives applied either parallel or perpendicular to the substrate asymmetry direction , when a finite magnus term is present , ratchet effects occur even in regimes where there is no ratchet motion in the overdamped limit , while multiple reversals of the ratchet effect can appear when the ac amplitude , the skyrmion density , or the ratio @xmath4 of the magnus term to the damping term is varied .",
    "the net dc drift of the skyrmions can be described as a vector which contains information about the magnitude of the drift and the angle between the drift direction and the substrate easy flow direction . with changing @xmath3 , ac amplitude , or skyrmion density ,",
    "the ratchet vector undergoes either a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of up to 360@xmath5 , indicating that ratcheting motion can occur in any direction for a 2d system .",
    "it is even possible to have a reversal in the direction of rotation of the ratchet vector .",
    "this system thus represents a new class of ratchet which we call a vector ratchet , and we predict that vector ratchets should be a general feature of any system in which magnus effects are important , including skyrmions in chiral magnets @xcite , skyrmion phases in p - wave superconductors @xcite , rotating colloids @xcite , and charged particles in magnetic fields such as dusty plasmas @xcite .",
    "additionally , since vector ratchets allow for motion in any direction , they also could serve as a new method to control skyrmion motion for spintronic applications .    .",

    "[ fig:11](a , b ) we plot the skyrmion positions , pinning site locations , and skyrmion trajectories in a sample with @xmath47 under a @xmath9 direction ac drive of @xmath160 , which produces a type vi ratchet with strong flux in the negative @xmath9 direction and weak flux in the negative @xmath8 direction . during the positive portion of the ac drive cycle , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:11](a ) , the skyrmions predominantly move in the positive @xmath9 direction . the flow is concentrated in the regions of lower pinning density , and there is a small amount of skyrmion hopping in the positive @xmath8 direction , which is the hard flow direction of the substrate asymmetry . if the pinning sites were not present , during the positive portion of the ac drive cycle the skyrmions would move with a hall angle of @xmath162 relative to the positive @xmath9 axis . instead , in fig .",
    "[ fig:11](a ) , the hall angle is nearly zero since skyrmion motion in the positive @xmath8 direction is blocked by the regions of dense pinning .",
    "the magnus term couples the @xmath8 and @xmath9 motion and causes the positive @xmath9 direction to act like a hard flow direction even though there is no asymmetry in the substrate along the @xmath9 direction . during the negative portion of the ac drive cycle , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:11](b ) , the motion is mostly in the negative @xmath9 direction , with some hopping in the negative @xmath8 direction .",
    "since the negative @xmath8 direction is the easy flow direction of the ratchet asymmetry , the magnus coupling causes the negative @xmath9 direction to act like an easy flow direction , and the net ratchet flux during the entire cycle is larger in the negative @xmath9 direction than in the positive @xmath9 direction , producing a net negative @xmath9 and negative @xmath8 flow .",
    "figure  [ fig:11](c ) shows the positive portion of the ac cycle for a drive of @xmath161 , while fig .",
    "[ fig:11](d ) shows the negative portion of the ac cycle at the same drive .",
    "for this ac drive amplitude , there is a strong ratchet flux in the negative @xmath8 direction and a weaker ratchet flux in the positive @xmath9 direction , giving a type iv ratchet effect .",
    "the ac drive is strong enough that , during the positive portion of the ac cycle in fig .",
    "[ fig:11](c ) , the skyrmions can pass through the densely pinned regions , and the resulting hall angle is larger than that observed at the lower ac amplitude of @xmath160 . during the negative portion of the ac cycle , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:11](d ) , the skyrmions continue to pass through the densely pinned regions , but since the negative @xmath8 direction is the easy flow direction of the substrate asymmetry , the net amount of negative @xmath8 motion is increased compared to that which occurs during the positive portion of the ac cycle , and correspondingly the amount of motion in the negative @xmath9 direction is decreased .",

    "[ fig:12](d ) , the corresponding @xmath73 versus @xmath3 plot indicates that the ratchet flux of the square gradient array is comparable to or even higher than that of the conformal array for @xmath166 , while the random gradient array shows almost no ratchet flux .",
    "we observe similar effects for fixed @xmath3 and varied ac amplitude @xmath113 . in general ,",
    "the conformal array produces the largest ratchet flux , while the ratchet flux for the square gradient array is weaker , and that of the random gradient array is the weakest .",
    "we have shown that ac driven skyrmions interacting with two - dimensional gradient pinning arrays represent a realization of a new type of ratchet system that we call a vector ratchet . in overdamped systems ,",
    "the ratchet flux is limited to flowing parallel to the substrate asymmetry direction in the forward or reverse direction .",
    "in contrast , the strongly non - dissipative magnus term found in skyrmion systems produces a skyrmion hall angle that couples the motion parallel and perpendicular to the substrate asymmetry direction .",
    "the resulting dc ratchet drift generated by the ac drive can be described as a vector which can rotate counter - clockwise or clockwise in the @xmath119 plane as the ac amplitude or the ratio of the magnus term to the dissipative term is varied , so that it is possible to realize reversals in the ratchet flux in both the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions .",
    "we show that this vector ratchet appears for ac driving both parallel to and perpendicular to the substrate asymmetry direction .",
    "the ratchet reversals we observe are a result of collective skyrmion interactions , as previous work on individual skyrmions interacting with asymmetric substrates showed no ratchet reversals .",
    "in addition to reversals in the ratchet flux in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions , the angular rotation of the ratchet vector itself can also show a reversal .",
    "we find that it is possible to have rotations of the ratchet vector of up to @xmath0 , indicating that vector ratchets can be used to direct skyrmion motion in any in - plane direction .",
    "thus , the vector ratchet could serve as a powerful new method for controlling skyrmion motion .",
