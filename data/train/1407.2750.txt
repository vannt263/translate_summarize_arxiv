    "an intriguing aspect of the iron - based high @xmath1 superconductor lafeaso@xmath2f@xmath3 ( @xmath11  k ) @xcite and related compounds such as ba(fe@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath12  k ) @xcite is their flexible nature in substituting atoms .",
    "for example , one can systematically alter the electronic properties of ba(fe@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath0as@xmath0 by increasing the co content from the spin density wave ( sdw ) ordered parent phase bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath13  k ) @xcite , the superconducting phase ba(fe@xmath14co@xmath15)@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath16  k ) @xcite , and to the overdoped non - superconducting phase with @xmath17 or greater @xcite .",
    "when the co concentration exceeds @xmath17 , the fermi surface nesting effects between the hole bands at the center of the brillouin zone and the electron bands at the edge of the brillouin zone diminish @xcite .",
    "in addition , the enhancement of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations ( afsf ) observed for the superconducting phase @xcite is suppressed in the overdoped region above @xmath17 @xcite , suggesting a link between the nesting effects , afsf , and the superconducting mechanism . recalling that kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 with one less electron within the feas layers is a low @xmath1 superconductor @xcite ,",
    "a natural question to ask is , what happens if one keeps increasing the co content @xmath18 , and reaches baco@xmath0as@xmath0 ?",
    "would the extra 3d electron at co sites completely alter the electronic properties of baco@xmath0as@xmath0 from that of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ?",
    "we attempted to address these questions by synthesizing baco@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals , and measuring their bulk properties @xcite .",
    "the in - plane electrical resistivity @xmath19 shows a metallic behavior with a quadratic @xmath20 temperature dependence below @xmath21  k , with a modestly large resistivity coefficient @xmath22 @xmath23",
    "the bulk susceptibility @xmath10 undergoes a strong enhancement toward @xmath25 . in the @xmath25 limit",
    ", the bare magnetic susceptibility data measured along the c - axis , @xmath26 emu / mol , is enhanced by a factor of @xmath27 over the results of lda ( local density approximation ) calculations , @xmath28 emu / mol @xcite .",
    "( we define the magnetic susceptibility for the formula unit throughout this paper . )",
    "the linear specific heat coefficient @xmath29  ( mj / k@xmath30 mol - co ) also implies a modest mass renormalization of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "lda results satisfy the mean - field stoner criterion of ferromagnetism , and found a stable ferromagnetic ground state with a sizable ordered moment , 0.42@xmath32/co , even though baco@xmath0as@xmath0 exhibits no evidence for a ferromagnetic long range order in bulk physical properties @xcite or microscopic nmr data , as shown below .",
    "the lda results therefore hint the presence of strong ferromagnetic spin correlations @xcite .",
    "recent arpes ( angle resolved photo emission spectroscopy ) measurements indeed showed that an electron pocket rather than a large hole pocket constitutes the primary fermi surface centered around the @xmath33 point , eliminating the possibility of the quasi - nesting effects of the fermi surface that tend to favor antiferromagnetic correlations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , by merely replacing ba@xmath34 ions in baco@xmath0as@xmath0 with sr@xmath34 ions , it is demonstrated that srco@xmath0as@xmath0 has stripe antiferromagnetic correlations , and @xmath10 decreases toward @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the contrasting behavior between baco@xmath0as@xmath0 and srco@xmath0as@xmath0 despite their analogous structures suggests that intricate details of the crystal structure , bond angles , crystal fields , and probably the electronic band structure affect their physical properties .    in this article",
    ", we will attempt to shed new light on the physical properties of baco@xmath0as@xmath0 through a microscopic nmr investigation . from the measurements of @xmath5as nmr knight shift @xmath9 and nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath35 , we probe the nature of electronic correlations .",
    "our results suggest that ferromagnetic spin fluctuations indeed begin to grow below about 100  k. on the other hand , comparison between @xmath9 and @xmath10 data reveals that there is a large temperature independent component in @xmath10 which has only a small contribution to @xmath9 .",
    "we therefore conclude that multiple 3d bands play different roles in baco@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will briefly describe the experimental procedures . results and discussions , and comparison with earlier",
    "nmr works on various compositions of ba(fe@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath0as@xmath0 will be detailed in section iii .",
    "we will summarize and conclude in section iv .",
    "we grew baco@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals out of coas flux .",
    "the details of the growth procedures and bulk characterization are described in @xcite .",
    "we carried out nmr measurements by assembling several pieces of small single crystals on a sample holder , and applying an external magnetic field along the aligned crystal c - axis .",
    "typical dimensions of the crystals were @xmath36 mm @xmath37 1 mm @xmath37 0.1 mm .",
    "we estimate the total mass of our nmr sample as a few mg .",
    "we employed a standard pulsed nmr spectrometer for spin echo measurements .",
    "in fig .  1 , we present representative @xmath5as nmr lineshapes observed at various temperatures in a magnetic field of @xmath39  t applied along the aligned crystal c - axis .",
    "@xmath5as nuclear spin is @xmath40 , hence we observe three distinct transitions at 290  k ; the large sharp peak near 56.69  mhz arises from the @xmath41 to @xmath42 central transition , while two additional broad peaks located near 56.14 and 57.22  mhz are from the @xmath43 to @xmath44 satellite transitions .",
    "the growing width of the central peak at lower temperatures is primarily caused by a distribution of the knight shift @xmath9 .",

    "is caused by the nuclear quadrupole interaction .",
    "the broader lineshape of the satellites reflects a sizable distribution of the c - axis component of the nuclear quadrupole frequency @xmath49 , possibly due to the presence of defects or vacancy sites .",
    "@xmath50 is a traceless tensor , i.e. @xmath51 , and is proportional to the efg ( electric field gradient ) tensor at the observed @xmath5as site .",
    "nmr measurements alone do not allow us to determine the sign of efg and @xmath49 .",
    "the observed magnitude of @xmath52  mhz at 4.2  k is comparable to @xmath53  mhz observed for the optimally superconducting ba(fe@xmath54co@xmath55)@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath56  k ) @xcite .",
    "we summarize the temperature dependence of @xmath49 in the inset to fig .  1",
    ", assuming that @xmath49 has a positive sign at 4.2  k. we emphasize that this assumption is made genuinely for convenience , to avoid confusions in the following discussions .",
    "@xmath57 gradually decreases with temperature up to @xmath58  k , where the satellite transitions are superposed with the central transition .",
    "this smooth temperature dependence is presumably caused by the thermal expansion of the lattice , which tends to decrease the magnitude of the lattice contribution @xcite to @xmath49 . at @xmath59",
    "k , @xmath60  mhz becomes sizable , and we can observe distinct satellite peaks again . the implicit assumption made in our plot in the inset to fig .",
    "1 is that there is a negative , on - site ionic contribution to @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "our experimental results do not rule out an alternative possibility that the sign of @xmath49 remains the same , and @xmath57 increases from @xmath58  k to @xmath59  k. it is also interesting to recall that @xmath57 in the iso - structural srco@xmath0as@xmath0 is as large as @xmath61  mhz @xcite .",
    "an order of magnitude difference in @xmath57 suggests that the local charge and/or lattice environment at the as sites is markedly different between the two materials , which may be related to the fact that baco@xmath62as@xmath62 is ferromagnetically correlated , as shown below , while srco@xmath62as@xmath62 is antiferromagnetically correlated @xcite .      in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we present the temperature dependence of @xmath5as nmr knight shift , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the observed peak frequency of the central transition , @xmath65 is the bare zeeman frequency @xmath66  mhz , and the @xmath5as nuclear gyromagnetic ratio is @xmath67",
    "the positive frequency shift from @xmath65 to @xmath64 is caused by the knight shift @xmath9 through hyperfine interactions with electron spins polarized by the applied field @xmath68 .",
    "for comparison , we also present @xmath9 reported earlier for ba(fe@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath0as@xmath0 for representative compositions with @xmath69 ( sdw ordered below @xmath70  k ) , @xmath71 ( superconducting below @xmath72  k ) , and @xmath73 ( overdoped paramagnetic metal ) @xcite .",
    "quite generally , @xmath9 may be represented as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is avogadro s number , and @xmath76 is the chemical shift .",

    "this observation is consistent with the fact that @xmath10 is also nearly an order of magnitude greater in baco@xmath0as@xmath0 .",

    "instead , @xmath9 in baco@xmath0as@xmath0 increases with decreasing temperature from 300  k , reaches a plateau below @xmath58  k , followed by a rapid growth below @xmath93  k.    also plotted in fig .",
    "2(a ) using the right axis is the temperature dependence of the bulk magnetic susceptibility @xmath10 measured in 0.1 tesla applied along the c - axis @xcite .",
    "the observed temperature dependence is qualitatively the same as that of @xmath9 .",
    "the upturn observed below @xmath61  k only for @xmath10 is presumably caused by a small impurity contribution obeying the curie s law , @xmath94 , because it is absent in the @xmath9 data .",
    "we note that @xmath9 is generally immune from the presence of impurity phases , and saturates below @xmath95  k. in fig .",
    "3 , we plot @xmath9 as a function of @xmath10 with temperature as the implicit parameter .",
    "the straight line observed in a wide range of temperature implies that the temperature dependence of @xmath9 is indeed dominated by the temperature dependent component of @xmath10 , which we refer to @xmath90 .    in the case of ba(fe@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath0as@xmath0",
    ", the temperature independent chemical shift @xmath76 is known to be at most @xmath96% @xcite .",
    "recent @xmath5as nmr results for other compounds with co@xmath34 ions , srco@xmath62as@xmath62 @xcite and lacoaso @xcite , also suggest that @xmath76 is negligibly small , and hence the extrapolation of the linear fit of the @xmath9 vs. @xmath10 goes through the origin .",
    "we reproduce such a linear fit observed for srco@xmath62as@xmath62 @xcite in fig .  3 .",
    "in contrast with the case of srco@xmath62as@xmath62 , the linear fit for baco@xmath62as@xmath62 crosses the horizontal axis at a large positive value of @xmath97  emu / mol .",
    "this term is too large to be attributed to the van vleck contribution , @xmath98 , which is of the order of @xmath99  emu / mol for 3d bands with a typical band width of @xmath100  ev .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is another temperature independent contribution @xmath101  emu / mol in @xmath10 , and we may separate the overall spin contribution into two , @xmath102 .",
    "we show these two separate contributions schematically with two vertical arrows in fig .",
    "both the temperature dependent @xmath90 and temperature independent @xmath103 are an order of magnitude greater than the bare spin susceptibility , @xmath28 emu / mol , estimated by lda calculations @xcite",
    ".    we can use eq .",
    "( 1 ) to estimate the hyperfine coupling @xmath104 with co spins in the band that is responsible for @xmath90 . from the slope in fig .  3",
    ", we estimate @xmath105 t/@xmath32 .",
    "this value is comparable to @xmath106 t/@xmath32 reported for srco@xmath62as@xmath62 @xcite , and approximately twice larger than @xmath107  t/@xmath32 reported for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the stronger hyperfine coupling might be an indication that co orbitals responsible for enhanced ferromagnetic correlations hybridize very strongly with as 4s and/or 4p orbitals . on the other hand , fig .",
    "2(a ) and fig .",
    "3 suggest that the @xmath103 term has a very little contribution to @xmath9 , which in turn implies that the hyperfine coupling @xmath108 with the co 3d orbitals that are responsible for @xmath103 is much weaker than @xmath104 .",
    "the electronic band structure calculations and arpes measurements for baco@xmath0as@xmath0 revealed two new distinct features compared with the case of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 : a small electron pocket near the @xmath33 point , which may favor ferromagnetic correlations , and a flat band , which tends to results in a large density of states ( and hence a large contribution to pauli susceptibility ) @xcite .",
    "therefore we tentatively attribute @xmath90 to the electron pocket near the @xmath33 point , while the temperature independent @xmath103 primarily to the flat portion of the band .",
    "we can not rule out other scenarios , and call for additional theoretical analysis of the band contributions to spin susceptibility in baco@xmath0as@xmath0 .      in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we present the temperature dependence of @xmath89 , i.e. @xmath5as nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath35 divided by temperature @xmath109 . in general , @xmath89 is a measure of the low - frequency component of spin fluctuations at the nmr frequency @xmath64 integrated over various wave vector @xmath7 modes in the first brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "@xmath89 for baco@xmath0as@xmath0 is nearly a factor of @xmath31 larger than that observed for the paramagnetic state of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 with a sdw ground state .",
    "this may be partly because the hyperfine couplings are twice larger in the present case , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "it is important to realize that the temperature dependence of @xmath89 observed for baco@xmath0as@xmath0 below @xmath58  k is qualitatively similar to that of the uniform @xmath110 mode of the spin susceptibility , @xmath90 .",
    "this finding is different from the case of ba(fe@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath0as@xmath0 , where the growth of @xmath89 at low temperatures is caused by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations @xcite , and hence the uniform spin susceptibility does not grow at low temperatures . these considerations lead us to conclude that the primary channel of the electronic correlations in baco@xmath0as@xmath0 is ferromagnetic in nature .",
    "we have reported nmr measurements of local spin susceptibility and low frequency spin fluctuations of baco@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "we demonstrated that both the nmr knight shift @xmath9 and @xmath89 grow toward @xmath25 due to ferromagnetic spin correlations .",
    "our conclusion is in agreement with earlier results based on bulk susceptibility and specific heat data , combined with lda calculations @xcite .",
    "in addition , our results in fig .  2 show",
    "that the so - called korringa ratio , @xmath111 @xcite , is as large as @xmath11210.3 at 4.2  k. ignoring the potential complications arising from the quasi - two dimensionality , the multi - band nature of the electronic states , and the wave - vector dependence of hyperfine couplings , such a large korringa ratio , @xmath113 , is indeed consistent with the presence of ferromagnetic correlations .",
    "our findings are in a remarkable contrast with the case of the other end member , bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , with a sdw ordered ground state , and modestly co - substituted superconducting ba(fe@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath0as@xmath0 . in these cases , the growth of spin fluctuations reflected on @xmath89 is not accompanied by that of @xmath9 , because the dominant correlation effects are antiferromagnetic at least up to @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "our new nmr results are also qualitatively different from those reported for srco@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite with a nearly antiferromagnetic ground state @xcite ; both nmr knight shift and @xmath89 decrease with temperature toward @xmath25 in srco@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "it remains to be seen why the electronic properties are so different between baco@xmath0as@xmath0 and srco@xmath0as@xmath0 .    from the comparison of @xmath10 and @xmath9",
    ", we also inferred that ferromagnetic enhancement does not affect all electronic bands .",
    "some co 3d electrons contribute to a temperature dependent term of spin susceptibility , which grows to @xmath115  emu / mol at 4.2  k. on the other hand , an equally large but temperature independent contribution , @xmath116  emu / mol , arises from co 3d orbitals with smaller hyperfine couplings with @xmath5as nuclear spins .",
    "the latter implies that these co 3d orbitals have weaker hybridization with as 4s and 4p orbitals .",
    "preliminary @xmath117co nmr measurements showed that the @xmath117co nmr knight shift @xmath118 exhibits analogous temperature dependence as @xmath5as nmr knight shift @xmath9 .",
    "the sign of @xmath118 in the present case , however , is negative , rather than positive observed in ba(fe@xmath54co@xmath55)@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the reversal of the sign suggests that the hyperfine coupling of co orbitals , and hence the nature of their hybridization , is different in the present case .",
    "we caution that our nmr data and analysis do not entirely rule out the possibility of antiferromagnetic spin correlations associated with @xmath103 . in this context",
    ", it is worth recalling that another well - known multi - band system , sr@xmath62ruo@xmath80 , turned out to exhibit strong antiferromagnetic spin correlations for two of the three bands , contrary to the initial expectations held by many authors @xcite .",
    "it is natural to speculate that @xmath119 and @xmath103 arise from separate parts of the fermi surface , such as the electron pocket near the @xmath33 point and the flat portion of the band with a large density of states , respectively .",
    "regardless of their origins , our finding implies that hund s coupling is not strong enough in baco@xmath0as@xmath0 to force all seven 3d electrons at co@xmath34 sites to exhibit an identical behavior . in this sense",
