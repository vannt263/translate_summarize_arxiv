    "transversity quark distributions in the nucleon remain among the most unknown leading twist hadronic observables , mainly due to their chiral - odd character which enforces their decoupling in most hard amplitudes . after the pioneering studies of ref .",
    ", much work @xcite has been devoted to the study of many channels but experimental difficulties have challenged the most promising ones .    on the other hand ,",
    "tremendous progress has been recently witnessed on the qcd description of hard exclusive processes , in terms of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) describing the 3-dimensional content of hadrons .",
    "access to the chiral - odd transversity gpds  @xcite , noted @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , has however turned out to be even more challenging  @xcite than the usual transversity distributions : one photon or one meson electroproduction leading twist amplitudes are insensitive to transversity gpds .",
    "the strategy which we follow here , as initiated in ref .  , is to study the leading twist contribution to processes where more mesons are present in the final state .",
    "a similar strategy has also been advocated recently in ref .   for chiral - even gpds .",
    "we advocate that the hard scale which allows to probe the short distance structure of the nucleon is @xmath8 in the fixed angle regime . in the example",
    "developed previously  @xcite , the process under study was the high energy photo ( or electro ) diffractive production of two vector mesons , the hard probe being the virtual `` pomeron '' exchange ( and the hard scale was the virtuality of this pomeron ) , in analogy with the virtual photon exchange occuring in the deep electroproduction of a meson .",
    "we study here @xcite a process involving a transversely polarized @xmath9 meson in a 3-body final state : @xmath10 it is a priori sensitive to chiral - odd gpds due to the chiral - odd character of the leading twist distribution amplitude ( da ) of @xmath11 .",
    "the estimated rate depends of course much on the magnitude of the chiral - odd gpds .",
    "not much is known about them , but model calculations have been developed in refs .   and a few moments have been computed on the lattice  @xcite . to factorize the amplitude of this process we use the now classical proof of the factorization of exclusive scattering at fixed angle and large energy  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude for the process @xmath12 is written as the convolution of mesonic das and a hard scattering subprocess amplitude @xmath13 with the meson states replaced by collinear quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "we then extract from the factorization procedure of the deeply virtual compton scattering amplitude near the forward region the right to replace one entering meson da by a @xmath14 gpd , and thus get fig .  1 .",
    "the needed skewness parameter @xmath15 is written in terms of the meson pair squared invariant mass @xmath16 as @xmath17    indeed the same collinear factorization property bases the validity of the leading twist approximation which either replaces the meson wave function by its da or the @xmath14 transition by nucleon gpds .",
    "a slight difference is that light cone fractions ( @xmath18 ) leaving the da are positive , while the corresponding fractions ( @xmath19 ) may be positive or negative in the case of the gpd .",
    "our born order calculation shows that this difference does not ruin the factorization property .    in order for the factorization of a partonic amplitude to be valid , and the leading twist calculation to be sufficient",
    ", one should avoid the dangerous kinematical regions where a small momentum transfer is exchanged in the upper blob , namely small @xmath20 or small @xmath21 , and the resonance regions for each of the invariant squared masses @xmath22 , @xmath23    let us finally stress that our discussion applies as well to the case of electroproduction where a moderate virtuality of the initial photon may help to access the perturbative domain with a lower value of the hard scale @xmath24 .",
    "the scattering amplitude of the process ( [ process ] ) is written in the factorized form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the hard part of the amplitude and the transversity gpd of a parton @xmath27 in the nucleon target which dominates at small momentum transfer is defined  @xcite by @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the light - cone helicities of the nucleon @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the chiral - odd da for the transversely polarized meson vector @xmath11 , is defined , in leading twist 2 , by the matrix element @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the @xmath9-meson transverse polarization and with @xmath35 = 160 mev .",
    "two classes of feynman diagrams without ( fig .  2 ) and with ( fig .",
    "3 ) a 3-gluon vertex describe this process .",
    "the scattering amplitude gets both a real and an imaginary part .",
    "integrations over @xmath36 and @xmath37 have been done analytically whereas numerical methods are used for the integration over @xmath38 .",
    "various observables can be calculated with this amplitude . we stress that even the unpolarized differential cross - section @xmath39 is sensitive to the transversity gpd .",
    "to estimate the rates , we modelize the dominant transversity gpd @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) in terms of double distributions @xmath42 with @xmath43 and where @xmath44 is the quark transversity double distribution written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a profile function and @xmath47 , @xmath48 are the quark and antiquark transversity parton distribution functions of ref .",
    ". the @xmath49-dependence of these chiral - odd gpds - and its fourier transform in terms of the transverse localization of quarks in the proton @xcite - is very interesting but completely unknown .",
    "we describe it in a simplistic way using a dipole form factor : @xmath50 in fig .  4",
    ", we show the @xmath16 dependence of the differential cross section @xmath51 for jlab kinematics ( @xmath52 ) . on the same plot",
    ", we show the similar cross section for the case where the @xmath9 meson is longitudinally polarized .",
    "note that in this case ( which will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming publication ) , the gpds which contribute are the usual chiral even ones , parametrized here through the usual double distribution ansatz .",
    ".2 in     at @xmath53 gev@xmath54 for the process @xmath55 for a transversely polarized (full curve ) and a longitudinally polarized ( dashed curve)@xmath56meson .",
    "the cuts are discussed in detail in ref .  .",
    ", width=302 ]    rate estimates @xcite show that expected luminosities at jlab ( after the 12 gev energy increase ) and at the compass experiment at cern are sufficient to gather a sample of interesting events allowing this physics to be experimentally tested .",
    "note that in the case of leptoproduction , the virtuality @xmath3 of the exchanged photon plays no crucial role in our process , and the virtual photoproduction cross section is almost @xmath3-independent if we choose to select events in a sufficiently narrow @xmath57window ( @xmath58 gev@xmath54 ) , which is legitimate since the effective photon flux is strongly peaked at very low values of @xmath3 .",
    "this procedure applied to muoproduction at compass yields a rate sufficient to get an estimate of the transversity gpds in the region of small @xmath15 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "target transverse spin asymetries need to consider nucleon helicity flip amplitudes , i.e. the effect of @xmath60 and/or @xmath61 gpds .",
    "this will be studied later on .    in conclusion",
    ", we expect the process discussed here to be observable in two quite different energy ranges , which should give complementary information on the chiral - odd transversity gpds : the large @xmath15 region may be scrutinized at jlab and the smaller @xmath15 region may be studied at compass .",
    "let us stress that our study is built on known leading twist factorization theorems , i.e. the scattering amplitude involves only leading twist non - perturbative components .",
    "this stays in contrast with other attempts to access transversity gpds @xcite .",
