    "the filamentation instability occurring when two plasmas shells collide has attracted considerable interest in recent years @xcite . in inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) ,",
    "the so - called fast ignition scenario @xcite implies the unstable transport of a relativistic electron beam passing through the fusion plasma . in astrophysics , it is thought that collisionless shocks resulting from the encounter of two collisionless plasma shells could be triggered by the same instability @xcite .",
    "the interest of these collisionless shocks is that they are able to accelerate particles up to high energies @xcite . because they also host magnetic turbulence ,",
    "energetic particles which have not yet escaped the shock environment radiate .",
    "these two features , acceleration and radiation in shock , could explain both high - energy - cosmic - rays ( hecr ) and gamma - ray - bursts ( grb ) @xcite .    in collisionless conditions when the mean free path is much larger than the system size , colliding plasma shells should pass through each other without anything happening .",
    "the reason why something happens instead of nothing is that as the shells interpenetrate , the overlapping region forms a counter - streaming system notoriously unstable @xcite .",
    "when analysing the full unstable spectrum in the relativistic regime , one finds the filamentation instability tends to govern the unstable spectrum for shells of similar densities @xcite .",
    "the instability , frequently referred to as weibel in literature , is found with a wave vector normal to the flow .",
    "physically , it simply stems from the fact that whenever small perturbations occur that trigger the apparition of flow - aligned micro - currents in the shells , the resulting opposite currents repel each other , amplifying the perturbation .",
    "while the occurrence of the instability is deleterious in icf @xcite , its presence in astrophysical settings guarantees the formation of collisionless shocks @xcite , hence grb s and hecr s .",
    "great attention should then be drawn to the factors capable of quenching it . in this respect , it has been long for now that a flow - aligned magnetic field can completely suppress the instability @xcite .",
    "but magnetic field could well be oblique with respect to the flow @xcite .",
    "for such configurations , it was proved recently in 2d that in the cold regime , the filamentation instability can be canceled if and only if the field is perfectly aligned with the flow @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the instability can not be suppressed by an oblique field , no matter how high .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to extend this result to the full 3d case .",
    "due to the complexity of the full kinetic theory , we address the cold ( i.e. mono - kinetic ) case . our setup is sketched in fig . [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the two homogenous and infinite shells have the initial velocities @xmath0 for the rightward one , and @xmath1 for the leftward .",
    "their initial densities are @xmath2 respectively .",
    "the magnetic field lies within the plan @xmath3 , and the angle @xmath4 is such that @xmath5 .",
    "we study perturbations with a wave vector within the plan @xmath6 , and the angle @xmath7 is defined by @xmath8 .",
    "when the field is flow - aligned , i.e. @xmath9 , the system is symmetric around the @xmath10 axis and one can freely align the wave vector with the @xmath11 axis .",
    "the growth - rate has no @xmath7 dependance and the system is 2d like @xcite . here",
    ", the oblique magnetic field breaks the symmetry and the 3d problem demands accounting for the two finite perpendicular @xmath12 components .",
    "both plasma shells are composed of electrons and protons , and we neglect the proton motion due to their inertia . at any rate , our goal here , besides evaluating the growth - rate , is to determine whether of not filamentation grows , and the corresponding @xmath7 range .",
    "the filamentation of the electrons will thus be a sign that indeed , the system is unstable and that a shock may form .",
    "since we work in the cold regime , we can write the conservation equation and the relativistic momentum equation for both species as , @xmath13 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 and with @xmath15 , @xmath16 being the electron mass .    because both shells are charge and current neutral by their own , the whole system is charge and current neutral in any reference frame .",
    "hence , we choose the reference frame where the initial velocities match the relation , @xmath17 that is , the reference frame where the center of mass is at rest .",
    "this allows to switch continuously from a symmetric collision , where plasmas come from each side at the same velocities ( @xmath18 ) , to the case where a diluted beam enters a plasma nearly at rest ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "in addition , working in the center of mass frame allows direct comparison with computer simulations , usually performed in this very frame .",
    "though lengthy , the derivation of the dispersion equation is quite standard .",
    "equations ( [ eqs ] ) are linearized assuming all quantities vary from their equilibrium value by small perturbations @xmath20 .",
    "when coupled with maxwell s equations , these linearized equations allow to derive the dielectric tensor which determinant is the dispersion equation .",
    "calculations are conducted analytically using a _",
    "notebook described elsewhere @xcite in terms of the variables , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the electronic cyclotron frequency and @xmath23 the electronic plasma frequency of the leftward shell .",
    "for clarity , we will treat the symmetric and diluted cases separately .",
    "a word of caution is needed regarding the validity of the growth - rate we are about to derive .",
    "because the @xmath24 field is not flow - aligned , it acts on the flow even at zeroth order .",
    "the present calculation are therefore meaningful provided the instability governs the early dynamic of the system , instead of the field .",
    "this implies a growth - rate @xmath25 ( in @xmath26 units ) larger than the cyclotron frequency due to the transverse component of the field , i.e. , @xmath27 where @xmath28 refers to the lorentz factor of the two species . for the symmetric case ,",
    "both lorentz factors are equal . in the diluted case where @xmath19 , eq . ( [ eq : ratio ] ) ensures @xmath29 , yielding a more stringent condition ( [ eq : valid ] ) .",
    "when is the inequality satisfied ? in the ultra - relativistic regime and for the symmetric case , for example , the system is like field - free .",
    "thus , the growth - rate approaches its field - free value @xmath30 @xcite , ensuring the fulfillment of the inequality above .    beyond the nearly trivial result , the inequality is not easily solved .",
    "we ll thus indicate on the forthcoming plots the limit it sets .",
    "indeed , our main goal here is to find out whether or not filamentation can be quenched , and which values of @xmath7 are the most unstable , as long as the instability governs the early system dynamic .",
    "units , as a function of @xmath31 for 3 field obliquities and @xmath32 .",
    "the horizontal plane indicates the limit sets by eq .",
    "( [ eq : valid ] ) . ]",
    "labeling @xmath25 the growth - rate in @xmath26 units , the symmetries @xmath33 and @xmath34 allows to restrict the study to the quadrant @xmath35 .",
    "it is known that for the 2d - like case , i.e. @xmath36 , the instability vanishes for @xmath37 @xcite . setting @xmath32 gives a critical field amplitude @xmath38 .",
    "we thus chose @xmath39 and vary the field obliquity @xmath4 to observe ( first , numerically ) how the instability cancelation evolves for @xmath40 . for @xmath9 , one can check on figure [ fig : sym ] how the growth - rate vanishes for @xmath41 . with such field orientation ,",
    "the system is symmetric around the @xmath10 axis , and its 2d nature is recovered .",
    "then , for @xmath4 as small as @xmath42 , the growth - rate still vanishes for small @xmath43 s but is clearly finite for other orientations .",
    "it can be noticed that although the lower part of the plane ( @xmath44 ) yields a growth - rate violating eq .",
    "( [ eq : valid ] ) , the large @xmath45 part of the spectrum fulfills it and remains therefore unstable .     for @xmath46 and @xmath32 .",
    "the angle @xmath7 is from bottom to top : 0 , @xmath47 and @xmath48.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    as is the case for the 2d problem , we observe the growth - rate saturates for @xmath49 . this can be checked in 3d on figure [ fig : symz ] where we focus on @xmath46 and plot the growth - rate in terms of @xmath50 for various orientations of the wave vector .",
    "this feature allows to write the dispersion equation in terms of @xmath51 and derive the asymptotic dispersion equation for large @xmath45 from the coefficient of the higher degree in @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting dispersion equation at @xmath52 reads ,    @xmath53 -\\beta ^2 \\omega_b^2 \\sin\\theta_b^2 \\cos(2\\theta_k ) -",
    "\\beta ^2 \\omega_b^2 \\sin\\theta_b^2 = 0.\\ ] ]    it can be solved exactly with , @xmath54 because this quantity is the high-@xmath45 growth - rate , it is also the maximum growth - rate in any given direction @xmath7 . therefore , canceling @xmath55 implies canceling the instability . setting @xmath56 now yields , @xmath57 and taking the square of both side gives @xmath58",
    "note that although necessary , this condition may not be sufficient .",
    "indeed , inserting ( [ eq : cancelsym ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : delasymzinf ] ) gives , @xmath59 let us now examine each possibilities offered by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cancelsym ] ) :    * eq . ( [ eq : cancelsym ] )",
    "can be fulfilled through @xmath60 . with then @xmath61 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cancelsym1 ] ) gives @xmath56 .",
    "this is the trivial case where there is no drift between the flows . *",
    "( [ eq : cancelsym ] ) can be fulfilled through @xmath62 . with now @xmath63 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cancelsym1 ] ) gives @xmath64 .",
    "this is the maximum growth - rate for the field - free case @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : cancelsym ] ) can be fulfilled through @xmath65 , that is , @xmath66 $ ] . here",
    "if @xmath61 , that is , @xmath37 .",
    "this is the condition for the cancellation of the instability in the flow - aligned field case @xcite .",
    "such cancellation is valid for all @xmath7 , so that the entire 3d @xmath12 spectrum is stabilized . * finally , eq . ( [ eq : cancelsym ] )",
    "can also be fulfilled through @xmath67 , that is , @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "the growth - rate vanishes now for @xmath61 , namely @xmath69 in this case , we find the instability can be canceled only for discrete orientations of the wave vector , namely , @xmath70 .",
    "the system remains therefore unstable for every other directions .",
    "the proof has thus been made that it is impossible to stabilize the entire @xmath12 spectrum unless the field is along the flow , with @xmath66 $ ] . for an oblique field",
    ", it is quite straightforward that the growth - rate ( [ eq : delasymzinf ] ) is a decreasing function of @xmath7 over @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "therefore , even when @xmath72 , we always have @xmath73 .",
    "this means that filamentation modes with a wave vector pertaining to the plan @xmath74 grow faster than the others .",
    "the orientation of the filament generated is therefore related to the orientation of the field .",
    "also , the 2d regime ( with necessarily @xmath36 ) usually studied in theory or simulations pertains indeed to the fastest growing configuration .",
    "although the large @xmath75 limit necessarily pertains to a regime governed by the field instead of the instability , the growth - rate in this limit is worth investigating in order to bridge with previous results @xcite .",
    "the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : delasymzinf ] ) is straightforward and gives , @xmath76 this result is simply the product of the field - free growth - rate for our present symmetric system , @xmath77 , times a geometric factor .",
    "and the geometric factor is just the 2d result ( @xmath36 ) , times a @xmath78 factor accounting for the orientation of @xmath12 . for @xmath9 ,",
    "we find @xmath79 , which means a flow - aligned field always ends - up canceling the instability . here again , we recover the fact that the growth - rate can be canceled only for @xmath80 $ ] or @xmath81 $ ] .     units , as a function of @xmath31 for 3 field obliquities , @xmath82 and @xmath32 .",
    "the horizontal plane indicates the limit sets by eq .",
    "( [ eq : valid ] ) . ]",
    "we now treat the @xmath19 , which amounts to a diluted beam passing to a plasma nearly at rest . in this respect , only the beam is relativistic now .",
    "in the diluted beam regime , the threshold for complete cancelation of the filamentation instability when @xmath9 is @xcite , @xmath83 figure [ fig : dilu ] features the growth - rate in terms of @xmath45 for various field obliquities and @xmath84 close to the threshold above .",
    "the patterns observed in the symmetric case repeat here , with in particular , a saturation at large @xmath45 and an uniform cancelation of the instability only achieved for @xmath9 .    still , the dispersion equation for @xmath52 , which gives the maximum growth - rate , in not amenable to a simple 4th order polynomial like eq .",
    "( [ eq : symzinf ] ) . instead , we find a 8th order polynomial without simple solution .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to guess a good approximation of @xmath55 from previous works , and numerically check its relevance .    in the 2d case @xcite ,",
    "the large @xmath75 limit of the growth - rate in the diluted beam regime can be deduced from the symmetric case multiplying the result by @xmath85 .",
    "also , the threshold for cancelation goes from @xmath86 in the symmetric case to @xmath87 in the diluted one . here also , multiplying the result by @xmath85 allows to switch between diluted and symmetric cases . denoting @xmath88 the symmetric result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : delasymzinf ] ) , the proposed _ ansatz _ for the diluted counterpart @xmath89 is @xmath90     for the diluted case , exact value vs. _ ansatz _ ( [ eq : dilu_zinf ] ) .",
    "parameters are @xmath91 and @xmath32 .",

    "the results obtained for the symmetric case are recovered . for an oblique field",
    ", the instability is canceled only for @xmath95 .",
    "furthermore , the maximum growth - rate is larger at @xmath36 , which again will determine the orientation of the generated filaments .",
    "the 3d filamentation instability of two cold counter - streaming beams in the presence of an oblique magnetic field has been examined for every possible orientations of the wave vector @xmath12 .",
    "our main result is that as is the case for previous 2d treatments @xcite , the instability can never be completely quenched for a non flow - aligned field .",
    "although the formalism is only valid when filamentation does govern the initial beam dynamic , the result remains .",
    "results are rigorous for the symmetric beams case , and rely on an _ ansatz _ for the diluted one .",
    "this 3d study brings an element by definition out of reach of the 2d problem : we find a systematically larger growth - rate for @xmath36 .",
