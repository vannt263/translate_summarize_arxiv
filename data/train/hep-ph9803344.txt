    "the dynamics of these systems is defined by lagrangian models whose solution ( in general , in a given approximation ) , allows for the calculation of macroscopic properties .",
    "one interesting issue which can be obtained from the lagrangian ( using , for example , the one - boson exchange approximation  obe  ) is the description of the two - body interaction in vacuum , in terms of a phenomenological potential .",
    "simple instances are the coulomb and yukawa potentials associated , respectively , to the exchange of massless and massive bosons .",
    "a consequence of the collective behavior in a plasma is the appearance of screening effects on the two - body interaction . in a classical electromagnetic plasma ,",
    "the coulomb - like interaction between two static charges in vacuum becomes , when modified by the medium , the exponentially damped debye interaction .",
    "however , in degenerate quantum electromagnetic plasmas the in - medium potential becomes long - ranged and oscillatory , both in the non - relativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite,@xcite cases .",
    "these so - called friedel oscillations have observable consequences @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological description of the nuclear interaction in vacuum through the exchange of massive mesons leads , in the static obe approximation , to an interparticle potential which is exponentially damped with the distance @xcite .",
    "the effects of the medium in a degenerate nuclear plasma , as obtained in the same approximation @xcite , or in a direct calculation of the interaction energy @xcite , introduce qualitative modifications on the two - particle interaction potential , which becomes long - ranged and oscillatory , as in the case of the degenerate electromagnetic plasma .",
    "the analysis of the screened potential in both cases allows for a separation into two components : a friedel - like component , which is damped as a power of the distance and dominates the long range , and an exponentially damped yukawa - like ( or debye - like in qed ) component .",
    "we must stress , however , that there are qualitative differences between this yukawa component and the debye screening of qed : the first one is , in fact , oscillatory below some critical temperature , whereas not such oscillations are present in the debye component in the qed plasma .",
    "friedel oscillations , which are present in both cases , fade away for lower temperatures @xcite . as we will discuss later , these _ yukawa oscillations _ are also present in other physical systems such as a quark - gluon plasma , for which kapusta et al .",
    "@xcite have been evidenced the existence of friedel oscillations .",
    "the analytic structure of the dressed propagators governs the behavior of the screened potential @xcite . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", friedel oscillations are associated to the kohn singularity @xcite in the matter part of the zero - temperature polarization tensor , which shows branch cuts starting at a transferred momentum @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the fermi momentum of fermions in the plasma .",
    "on the other hand , yukawa oscillations are associated to a pole of the propagator in the complex @xmath0 -plane which has a non - vanishing real part , in contrast to debye screening , which arises from a pole on the imaginary axis .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the two - particle interaction in dense plasmas , using the above mentioned models .",
    "here we are not interested in a precise quantitative description of actual dense matter using more or less adapted theoretical models .",
    "our main concern is rather to evidence the above mentioned characteristics of the screening , as a result from basic properties which seem to be present in some relativistic models describing dense matter and , eventually , to discuss the limitations of such models .",
    "the ground states of the plasma in the electromagnetic and in the quark - gluon cases are described as relativistic free fermi gases in thermodynamical equilibrium . for the qhd nuclear plasma ,",
    "the ground state is described by the relativistic hartree approximation ( rha ) @xcite , which defines the thermodynamics at finite temperature and includes the contributions of vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the propagators of the exchanged bosons which are necessary to obtain the screened potential are dressed by the medium .",
    "their expressions have been obtained in a self - consistent one - loop approximation , where matter polarization contributions were calculated at finite temperature and vacuum polarization contributions were included .",
    "such approximation , for qhd , is the first order of a kinetic cluster expansion around the relativistic hartree ground state @xcite and coincide at @xmath3 with the usual one - loop approximation @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the essential equations which are necessary for the analysis of the screening in the models . in section 3",
    "we study the analytic structure of the meson propagators and the oscillatory behavior of the screened potentials .",
    "we conclude in section 4 with a discussion on the eventual manifestations in actual systems of the phenomena found here .",

    "then , @xmath10 corresponds to the boson propagator , and @xmath11 is related to the boson self - energy .    to be more explicit , we need to consider each case separately . as representative of qhd",
    ", we will study the one - pion exchange .",
    "in this case , one has to replace @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the pion - nucleon coupling constant , and take into account the pion mass .",
    "this means that the pion propagator @xmath14 must be written as : @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the pion polarization , which can be decomposed into a matter and a renormalized vacuum contribution @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the pion mass .",
    "we have included a pion - sigma coupling term in the lagrangian , as in @xcite , with @xmath19 finally , @xmath20 mev represents the @xmath21-meson mass and @xmath22 the self - consistent mean - field value of this meson field . the renormalized vacuum contribution to the pion polarization",
    "is given by :    @xmath23 \\ }   \\label{eq:(23)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the nucleon effective mass , calculated in the hartree approximation .",
    "in the next section we give the expression for the matter contribution .",
    "from the expression ( [ eq:(33 ) ] ) we see that the analytic structure of the propagators on the @xmath27 axis becomes the essential magnitude which governs the behavior of the screening . in the qhd case",
    "there are poles of the propagator on this axis associated to the  tachyonic  branches , which come from the vacuum polarization terms @xcite .",
    "such poles arise at large momentum transfer , where the internal structure of the nucleon invalidates the point - particle approach of the model and thus , the effect of this pole on the calculated in - medium potential is spurious .",
    "we can try to account phenomenologically for the nucleon structure by the introduction of monopolar form factors @xmath28 on the vertex of the loop expansion and the obe diagrams . to do this",
    "we have to replace , in the previous equations    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is a cut - off parameter .",
    "when the value of this parameter is properly chosen , the spurious  tachyonic  branches ( and the associated pole of the propagator on the @xmath9 axis ) disappear . of course",
    ", one could also eliminate the poles associated to these branches by simply discarding the renormalized vacuum polarization contribution . however , this contribution is essential in obtaining the physical propagation modes .",
    "if neglected , new unphysical space - like modes ( which introduce new poles in the propagators at small @xmath0 ) are present and can not be eliminated by form factors @xcite .",
    "the standard expression of the form factors eq .",
    "( [ eq:(34 ) ] ) fits well the known data in vacuum @xcite . at finite density and",
    "temperature the form factor is expected to be modified by the medium . in a simple bag - model picture the nucleons  swell  as density increases ( emc effect ) , due to a reduction of the bag pressure .",
    "higher - order calculations of the vertex function @xcite , where the surrounding meson cloud defines the size of the nucleon , leads to a similar behavior . here",
    "we shall keep the form factor unchanged in the medium according to our level of approximation , but it must be emphasized that , in an improved calculation , the above mentioned effect will cause a stronger suppression of high - momentum exchanges at larger densities . nevertheless , these modifications would affect the short - range part of the interaction , and will not modify our main conclusions , which concern the long - range behavior of the screened potential .",
    "we will also analyze the one - gluon exchange screened potential on a color - singlet state of a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "for this analysis , we have considered a @xmath31 quark - gluon plasma with @xmath32 quark flavors .",
    "one has to replace @xmath33 in this case in eq .",
    "( [ eq:(33 ) ] ) , where @xmath34 will be the coupling constant .",
    "in order to simplify our analysis , we have restricted ourselves to a plasma with only @xmath35 and @xmath36 massless quarks with the same chemical potential .",
    "the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ eq:(33 ) ] ) is then related to the one - loop gluon polarization in the static limit .",

    "this transition can also be presented , from a formal point of view , as @xmath75 becoming imaginary(and negative ) , thus being effectively substracted from the value of @xmath51 and producing the kink observed on fig .",

    "@xmath80 vanishes , and one has @xmath89 therefore , the gluon propagator has poles on the real axis ( at @xmath90 ) , and the long - distance behavior of @xmath45 is dominated by these poles . we have analyzed the behavior of this pole as @xmath2 increases , for a chosen value of @xmath91 mev .",
    "first , the position of this pole shifts from the value of @xmath92 , and a second pole at smaller @xmath0 appears .",

    "in this work , we have considered plasma screening effects on the potential interaction for two static charges in different models of dense matter .",
    "first , we studied the one - pion exchange in nuclear matter , as representative of qhd ( quantum hadrodynamics ) .",
    "in addition to friedel oscillations , which arise due to logarithmic branch cuts on the complex q - plane of the pion propagator , we find that this propagator shows a pole on this plane at zero temperature and densities above saturation .",
    "this pole gives rise to additional oscillations on the nucleon - nucleon potential , which we refer to as yukawa oscillations. in contrast to friedel oscillations , which are damped as some power - law of the distance , yukawa oscillations are exponentially damped with distance .",
    "another important difference is the temperature behavior .",
    "while friedel oscillations are strongly suppressed for temperatures of a few mev , yukawa oscillations are present up to @xmath109 mev when the density is equal to the saturation density .",
    "there is a critical temperature @xmath73 for each density , below which yukawa oscillations are present .    in order to investigate wether",
    "this phenomena are a peculiarity of this model or not , we have made further research .",
    "one feature of the pion exchange is the large value of the coupling constant .",
    "we considered the one - photon propagator in a qed plasma with an artificially increased value of the electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "however , we found no yukawa poles even if the coupling constant is taken to be of the order of unity or more .",
    "thus , a large value of the coupling constant alone can not explain the origin of such pole .",
    "another important feature of qhd is that it shows no asymptotic freedom .",
    "this feature originates some pathologies in the meson sector , such as the appearance of tachyonich branches @xcite,@xcite .",
    "therefore , one might suspect that yukawa poles are also a pathological behavior of non asymptotically - free field - nuclear models . in order to investigate this aspect",
    ", we have studied the singlet quark - antiquark potential in a qcd quark - gluon plasma . in the case we studied ,",
    "yukawa poles appear , at zero temperature , when the quark fermi momentum reaches @xmath93 mev and remain for larger densities . when the temperature is increased they survive , at least up to @xmath110 gev , which is the maximum temperature we reached in our calculations .",
    "this situation is in contrast with the one - pion model , where the pole disappears at some critical temperature .",
    "it is important to notice that , although the values of @xmath0 at the pole are close to @xmath92 for low densities and temperatures , they become large ( as compared to @xmath92 ) if the density and/or temperature increases . since one expects to obtain asymptotic freedom in this limit",
    ", a perturbative treatment like the one we have considered has more chances to be valid in these circumstances . in other words ,",
    "yukawa poles in a nuclear medium do not seem to be associated to non - asymptotically free theories and might correspond to some underlying physical phenomenon . as in the case of friedel oscillations ,",
    "this could manifest in the appearance of new phases in dense matter .",
    "of course , they could also be a consequence of the approximations made in our models ( namely the one - loop approximation ) and might be not present in more realistic calculations",
    ". this will be the subject of a future work ."
