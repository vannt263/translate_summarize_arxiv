    "we consider the specific system outlined in the figure  [ f : picture ] . here",
    "two electron spins are localized in adjacent quantum dots , coupled via tunneling .",
    "one of the dots is capacitively coupled to a transmission line resonator . a modest ( 100 mt ) external magnetic field along an axis @xmath7 zeeman - splits the spin - aligned states , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while the spin - anti - aligned states are used as a qubit degree of freedom : @xmath10 and @xmath11 . the notation @xmath12 labels the number of electrons in the left and right quantum dots .",
    "in addition to the qubit states , an auxiliary singlet state with two electrons in one quantum dot , @xmath3 , is coupled via tunneling @xmath0 to the separated singlet , @xmath13 ( fig .  [ f : picture]b ) .",
    "the energy of the auxiliary state is determine largely by the bias @xmath14 due to the electric field ; control of @xmath14 allows to control the qubit s evolution .",
    "the hamiltonian for this three state system is : @xmath15 we have introduced a static magnetic field gradient between the two dots @xmath16 , which mixes the singlet and triplet states .",
    "this system has been studied in detail in refs .  .",
    "parameter ranges for experiments are @xmath17ev and @xmath18ev .",
    "state preparation , measurement , 1-qubit gates , and local 2-qubit gates can be achieved by changing the bias @xmath14 between @xmath3 and @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "interaction with the resonator is included naturally by writing the bias as a contribution from static fields , @xmath2 , set by voltages on the gates defining the double dot , and a contribution from the resonator itself : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the capacitive coupling of the resonator to the dot , while @xmath21 is the total capacitance of the double dot .",
    "the voltage due to the resonator of length @xmath22 , capacitance per unit length @xmath23 , and impedance @xmath24 is quantized as  @xcite @xmath25    we now deduce an effective hamiltonian for the system when the splitting between eigenstates of eq .",
    "[ e : hdd ] , @xmath26 , is comparable to the fundamental mode frequency of the resonator , @xmath27 ( i.e. , the cavity detuning @xmath28 is small ) . neglecting the higher energy modes , we write the hamiltonian for the resonator itself as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the lowest energy mode destruction operator , and the interaction with the dot is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the vacuum rabi coupling between the double dot and the resonator . in practice , for @xmath33 ghz , @xmath34 mhz ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) is achievable  @xcite ) .",
    "a reduction of @xmath36 by lowering @xmath37 results in a comparable reduction of @xmath38 .",
    "finally , as @xmath39 resonators are possible in the microwave domain  @xcite , the quantization of the resonator voltage is appropriate . in practice ,",
    "the need to work with a finite local external magnetic field ( 100 mt ) may limit @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "we seek a set of parameters @xmath41 such that the system can be coupled to and controlled by the resonator . this `` operating point '' should maximize the coupling to the resonator and minimize the noise in the combined system . to motivate the optimal choice ,",
    "let us first proceed with small tunnel coupling @xmath0 and cavity coupling @xmath38 . in this case",
    "the eigenstates are @xmath42 , with eigenenergies @xmath43 . setting the energy difference @xmath44 ,",
    "degenerate perturbation theory in the tunnel coupling @xmath0 reveals an avoided crossing at this balanced point between @xmath45 and @xmath3 with an energy gap @xmath46 around @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ f : picture]b ) and mixing angle @xmath48 . working in the rotating frame with the rotating wave approximation , we find an effective hamiltonian for the combined system to be @xmath49 where , at @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52    we choose @xmath53 for two reasons .",
    "first , at this point the gap @xmath26 is insensitive to first - order changes in @xmath2 and @xmath54 .",
    "such zero - derivative points are optimal for controlling quantum bits with imperfect electronics and in the presence of low frequency noise  @xcite . in our case",
    "this suppresses fluctuations in control electronics ( @xmath2 ) and in the magnetic field gradient ( due to hyperfine interactions ) , which are the dominant dephasing terms .",
    "second , the coupling coefficient @xmath55 is directly proportional to the energy splitting in the system , as would be expected of a `` bare '' coupling of comparable strength",
    ".    the cost of working at this point is increased sensitivity to fluctuations in @xmath0 ( it effects both @xmath55 and @xmath26 at first order ) and a higher probability of relaxation due to the enhanced charge admixture of the qubit states ( see the analysis of inelastic effects below ) .",
    "the former could be mitigated : as no time - dependent control of @xmath0 is required , the gates that set @xmath0 can be heavily filtered to greatly reduce potential noise .    for long term storage of the quantum information",
    ", we can adiabatically map the states @xmath56 to the spin states @xmath57 via change of @xmath2 , going to a well separated regime .",
    "as long as the change of @xmath2 is slow with respect to the splitting @xmath54 , the process is entirely adiabatic ; furthermore , we are only sensitive to charge fluctuations on a frequency scale faster than @xmath58 . the spin states , protected by occassional refocusing , are mostly insensitive to charge relaxation and dephasing  @xcite .",
    "thus , when long quantum memory times or insensitivity to charge - based relaxation is necessary , the system can be adiabatically mapped to such a separated regime ; when operation with the resonator is necessary , they can be mapped back to the balanced regime of @xmath59 .",
    "we now proceed to generalize the above analysis to an arbitrary set of parameters @xmath60 , treating the interaction with the cavity as a perturbation .",
    "we write the eigenenergies of @xmath61 as @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ) and the eigenvectors as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a 3x3 unitary matrix . in the rotating wave approximation",
    ", we may neglect all cavity interaction terms diagonal in the eigenstates .",
    "furthermore , when the energy differences are non - degenerate ( @xmath67 ) , we may also only keep coupling to the transition with energy @xmath68 .",
    "then , @xmath69 thus , @xmath70 . keeping @xmath0 fixed , we plot @xmath55 and the expected error in operations due to relaxation ( calculated below ) . of immediate interest",
    "is the regime of @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this suggests that maximal coupling to the cavity occurs when @xmath74 , and @xmath54 are all comparable .    , in units of bare coupling @xmath38 , as a function of field gradient @xmath54 and bias @xmath2 .",
    "( b ) calculated probability of error in swapping a double - dot state with the resonator state due to charge - based relaxation using @xmath75ev and an inverse temperature of 10 @xmath76ev .",
    "[ f : coupling],width=288 ]",
    "we now demonstrate the favorable noise properties of the balanced system .",
    "three kinds of error are considered : relaxation of the charge system in a time @xmath77 , additional dephasing of the charge system in a time @xmath78 , and decay of the cavity photon at a rate @xmath79 .",
    "we assume the additional dephasing arises from low frequency fluctuations  @xcite , due to changes of the electrostatic gates and magnetic field gradient , e.g. , as noise on @xmath2 and @xmath54 .    for charge - based relaxation , coupling to a phonon bath with spectral density @xmath80 will lead to decay  @xcite .",
    "using the spin - boson model in the perturbative regime yields an overall error rate from relaxation and incoherent excitation : @xmath81 we estimate @xmath82 at @xmath83ev/@xmath84 using measured charge relaxation times  @xcite . for a double quantum dot system in gaas and small @xmath26 , @xmath85  @xcite .",
    "this indicates @xmath86 for the low energy limit .",
    "reducing the resonant frequency lowers relaxation rates . near the optimal point , with @xmath87 2 ghz , @xmath88s .",
    "additional dephasing ( @xmath89 term ) arises from variations of the energy gap , @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "we assume a high frequency cutoff of the noise at @xmath92 .",
    "the contribution to error at first order arises from @xmath93 .",
    "when the pre - factor @xmath94 is non zero , there is first - order dephasing .",
    "in the rotating frame , the off - diagonal density matrix element evolves as @xmath95\\ .",
    "\\label{e : decay}\\ ] ] for example , when @xmath96 , the decay is gaussian with a time constant @xmath97 , where the characteristic time @xmath98 .",
    "bare dephasing times of @xmath99 ns were observed for qubit frequencies of @xmath100 ghz  @xcite .",
    "however , longer @xmath101 times might be achieved for qubits at @xmath102 ghz through better high- and low - frequency filtering of electronics noise .",
    "we will take @xmath103 ns for the remainder of the paper ; this limit arises from the combined effect of charge - based terms and nuclear spin - related dephasing  @xcite .    at the zero derivative point ( @xmath104 ) second - order terms",
    "must be considered  @xcite . to the leading order  @xcite , we find dephasing occurs over a timescale @xmath105 .",
    "more detailed calculations indicate that the underlying physics of the bath becomes important near zero - derivative points  @xcite .",
    "thus the optimal point combines the maximal coupling @xmath55 to the resonator with an extended @xmath106 time ( fig .",
    "[ f : dephasing ] ) . in this regime , with @xmath107 ghz , @xmath108 .",
    "we note that away from the optimal point , even assuming maximal coupling , @xmath109 .",
    "for example , in the strongly biased regime ( @xmath110 ) , @xmath111 .",
    "we conclude that only near the optimal point may the strong coupling regime be achieved .",
    "( black ) , @xmath112 ( blue ) , and @xmath113 ( red ) .",
    "the region of @xmath72 is marked in grey .",
    "[ f : dephasing],width=288 ]",
    "we now discuss potential applications .",
    "coherent control of the system with little sensitivity to low frequency noise is achieved by driving the resonator on resonance with a microwave pulse .",
    "we can describe this scenario by making the cavity state a coherent state , @xmath114 , letting us replace @xmath30 with @xmath115 .",
    "we would expect rabi oscillations between @xmath116 and @xmath117 with rabi frequency @xmath118 .",
    "low frequency components of the driving field ( dc offsets ) are greatly reduced because of the gap induced by @xmath0 and the insensitivity of the gap energy @xmath26 on variations of @xmath14 .",
    "another technique is a quantum non - demolition measurement .",
    "when the microwave transition is detuned from the cavity by @xmath119 , the evolution yeilds a qubit - dependent phase of @xmath120 ( for @xmath56 states respectively ) for an injected microwave field over a time @xmath121 ( limited by qubit decay ) . assuming that the noise level of the detector exceeds the background by about a factor of ten , the fidelity of such a qnd measurement of the encoded spin qubits is given by @xmath122  @xcite .",
    "this single qubit qnd measurement can be completed in a time @xmath123s .",
    "in addition , a wide variety of cavity qed quantum control techniques may be accessible . as an example , we focus on the swap operation , where the qubit state is `` swapped '' with a photonic state of the resonator . when there are no photons in the cavity and @xmath124 , the state @xmath125 is stationary , while @xmath126 oscillates with rabi frequency @xmath127 to the state @xmath128 ( we use @xmath129 to indicate @xmath130 photons in the cavity mode ) . when the time spent oscillating is @xmath131 , a quantum state of the singlet  triplet system is mapped to the existence or absence of a cavity photon",
    ": @xmath132 this process can be controlled by rapidly changing @xmath133 to and from zero .",
    "in essence , we can convert one quantum bit ( the double - dot system ) to another quantum bit ( the cavity photon ) , which can then be used for a variety of quantum information tasks , such as long - distance quantum gates , quantum communication , and quantum repeaters  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it may allow for coupling to other qubit systems , such as atoms , molecules  @xcite , or superconducting qubits  @xcite .",
    "as an example , we now detail the expected errors for the swap operation .",
    "both @xmath77 and @xmath79 contribute to the decay of the system , which lead to population of the state @xmath134 , while dephasing , @xmath135 , leads to phase errors in the transformation . including only relaxation terms , yields a probability of error in `` swap '' of @xmath136 .",
    "in addition , pure dephasing ( @xmath135 ) leads to an error with probability @xmath137 .",
    "the optimal point has @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 from noise in @xmath2 and @xmath54 .",
    "optimizing against both noise sources suggests that for a bare dephasing time of @xmath141 ns , a cavity frequency of @xmath142 1.5 ghz is optimal for swap operations , with a probability of error @xmath143 .",
    "in summary , we have shown how spin states of double quantum dots can be coupled directly to microwave resonators . an optimal operating point with maximum coupling to the resonator and minimum coupling to some sources of charge and spin noise is found .",
    "this suggests a variety of powerful quantum control techniques may become possible for such a system ."
