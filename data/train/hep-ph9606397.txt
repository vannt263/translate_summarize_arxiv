    "despite the unquestionable significance of its achievements , like that of predicting the existence of the top quark , there is no reason to believe that the standard model ( sm ) is the final theory .",
    "for instance , the sm contains many arbitrary parameters with no apparent connections .",
    "in addition , the sm provides no satisfactory explanation for the symmetry - breaking mechanism which takes place and gives rise to the observed mass spectrum of the gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "because the top quark is heavy relative to other observed fundamental particles , one expects that any underlying theory , to supersede the sm at some high energy scale @xmath7 , will easily reveal itself at lower energies through the effective interactions of the top quark to other light particles . also because the top quark mass ( @xmath8 ) is of the order of the fermi scale @xmath9gev @xcite , which characterizes the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale , the top quark system could be a useful probe for the symmetry - breaking sector .",
    "furthermore , the fermion mass generation can be closely related to the electroweak symmetry - breaking mechanism , one expects some residual effects of this mechanism to appear in accordance with the mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "this means that new effects should be more apparent in the top quark sector than in any other light sector of the theory .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the top quark system as a direct tool to probe new physics effects @xcite .    because of the great diversity of models proposed for possible new physics ( beyond the sm ) , it has become necessary to study these possible new interactions in a model independent approach @xcite .",
    "this approach has proved to render relevant non - trivial information about the possible deviations from the standard couplings of the heavier elementary particles ( heavy scalar bosons , the bottom and the top quarks , etc . )",
    "our study focuses on the top quark , which because of its remarkably higher mass is the best candidate among the fermion particles for manifesting these anomalous interactions at high energies .",
    "a common approach to study these anomalous couplings is to consider the most general on - shell vertices ( form factors ) involving the bottom and the top quarks and the gauge bosons of interest @xcite . in this work",
    "we will incorporate the effective chiral lagrangian approach @xcite , which is based on the principle of gauge symmetry , but the symmetry is realized in the most general ( non - linear ) form so as to encompass all the possible interactions consistent with the existing experimental data .",
    "the idea of using this approach is to exploit the linearly realized @xmath10 symmetry and the non - linearly realized @xmath11 symmetry to make a systematic characterization of all the anomalous couplings . in this way , for example , different couplings which otherwise would be considered as independent become related through the equations of motion .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that low energy data ( including @xmath12 pole physics ) generally do not impose any stringent constraints on the @xmath13 coefficients of the anomalous couplings in @xmath14 [ cf .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ] .",
    "hence these anomalous couplings have to be directly measured via production of top quarks at the colliders .",
    "for instance , the couplings @xmath15 can be measured from the decay of the top quarks in @xmath16 pairs produced either at hadron colliders , such as the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , or at the electron linear collider ( lc ) .",
    "they can also be studied from the production of the single - top quark events via @xmath17-gluon fusion ( @xmath18 ) @xcite or the drell - yan like ( @xmath19 ) @xcite processes at the hadron colliders , as well as from the @xmath17-photon fusion ( @xmath20 ) process at the electron colliders @xcite .",
    "the coupling @xmath21 can only be sensitively probed at a future linear collider via the @xmath22 process @xcite because at hadron colliders the @xmath23 production rate is dominated by qcd interactions ( @xmath24 ) . at the lhc @xmath21",
    "may also be studied via the associated production of @xmath23 with @xmath12 bosons , which deserves a separate study .    in this work",
    ", we will extend the previous study by including dimension 5 fermionic operators , and then examine the precision with which the coefficients of these operators can be measured in high energy collisions .",
    "since it is the electroweak symmetry breaking sector that we are interested in , we shall concentrate on the interaction of the top quark with the longitudinal weak gauge bosons ; which are equivalent to the would - be goldstone bosons in the high energy limit .",
    "this equivalence is known as the goldstone equivalence theorem @xcite-@xcite .    for simplicity",
    ", we will only construct the complete set of dimension 5 effective operators for the fermions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , although our results can be trivially extended for operators including other fermions such as the flavor changing neutral interactions @xmath25-@xmath27-@xmath12 , @xmath25-@xmath27-@xmath28 @xcite and @xmath25-@xmath27-@xmath29 @xcite .",
    "our strategy for probing these anomalous dimension 5 operators ( @xmath30 ) is to study the production of @xmath31 pairs as well as single-@xmath25 or @xmath32 via the @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( denoted in general as @xmath4 ) fusion processes in the tev region .",
    "as we shall show later , the leading contribution of the scattering amplitudes at high energy goes as @xmath2 for the anomalous operators @xmath30 , where @xmath36 is the cm energy of the @xmath37 or @xmath38 system ( that produces @xmath39 ) , or the @xmath40 system ( that produces @xmath1 or @xmath41 ) . on the other hand , when the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 are zero , the dimension 4 operators @xmath14 can at most contribute with the first power @xmath44 to these scattering @xmath4 processes .",
    "hence , in this case , the @xmath45 scatterings in the high energy region are more sensitive to @xmath30 than to @xmath14 .",
    "if these @xmath13 s are not zero , then the high energy behavior can at most grow as @xmath3 as compared to @xmath2 for the dimension 5 operators ( see appendix b ) .    as mentioned before , the dimension 4 anomalous couplings @xmath13 s are better measured at the scale of @xmath46 or @xmath47 by studying the decay or the production of the top quark at either the tevatron , the lhc , or the lc near the @xmath39 threshold . since , as mentioned above , the dimension 5 operators are better measured in the tev region , we shall assume that by the time their measurement is feasible , the @xmath13 s will already be known . thus , to simplify our discussion , we will take the values of the @xmath13 s to be zero when presenting our numerical results .",
    "we show that there are 19 independent dimension 5 operators ( with only @xmath25 , @xmath26 and gauge boson fields ) in @xmath30 after imposing the equations of motion for the effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "it is expected that at the lhc or the lc there will be about a few hundreds to a few thousands of @xmath39 pairs or single-@xmath25 ( or single-@xmath32 ) events produced via the @xmath4 fusion processes .",
    "the coefficients of these operators , with the pre - factor @xmath48 , could be measured at the lc ( less likely at the lhc ) to order @xmath49 or @xmath5 .",
    "as will shown later , the pre - factor @xmath48 is suggested by the naive dimensional analysis @xcite , and @xmath50 is the cut - off scale of the effective theory .",
    "it could be the lowest new heavy mass scale , or something around @xmath51 tev if no new resonances exist below @xmath50 . as a comparison",
    ", the coefficients of the nlo bosonic operators are usually determined to about an order of @xmath5 or @xmath52 via @xmath53 processes @xcite .",
    "hence , the scattering processes @xmath54 at high energy may be more sensitive for probing some symmetry breaking mechanisms than @xmath53 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the general framework of the electroweak chiral lagrangian is presented . in section 3",
    "we make a systematic characterization of all the independent dimension 5 operators that are invariant under the symmetry of the gauge group .",
    "section 4 deals with the cp properties of these interactions . in section 5",
    "we make a general analysis of their potential contribution to the production cross section of top quarks according to their behavior at high energies .",
    "a very useful simplification is made by considering an approximate custodial symmetry in our set of operators ; this is discussed in section 6 .",
    "section 7 contains the analytical results for the amplitudes of various @xmath4 fusion processes ; an approximate custodial symmetry is assumed here , but the general expressions can be found in appendices b and c. finally , in section 8 we discuss the values for the coefficients of these anomalous operators at which a significant signal can appear at both the lhc and the lc ; also , we include an example of how one can measure possible cp violating effects coming from these operators .",
    "section 9 has our conclusions .",
    "we consider the electroweak theories in which the gauge symmetry @xmath55 is spontaneously broken down to @xmath56@xcite .",
    "there are three goldstone bosons , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , generated by this breakdown of @xmath59 into @xmath60 , which are eventually _ eaten _ by the @xmath61 and @xmath12 gauge bosons and become their longitudinal degrees of freedom",
    ".    in the non - linearly realized chiral lagrangian formulation , the goldstone bosons transform non - linearly under @xmath59 but linearly under the subgroup @xmath60 . a convenient way to handle",

    "first of all , we only have two possibilities : + ( 3.1 ) one derivative acting on each fermion field , and + ( 3.2 ) both derivatives acting on the same fermion field .",
    "+ ( 3.1 ) just like in the case ( 2.1 ) above , we first notice that an operator of the form @xmath192 can be decomposed into operators of the previous cases ( 1.1 ) , ( 1.2 ) and ( 1.3 ) by means of the equations of motion .",

    "the natural separation of these two parts happens to be a common feature of all operators with only one type of fermion field",
    ". nevertheless , not always will the parity conserving part also be cp even , as we shall soon see .",

    "this is because under a cp transformation a scalar term @xmath206 remains intact , i.e. it does not change sign , whereas a pseudoscalar term @xmath207 changes sign . also , the gauge bosons change sign under c , which is what makes the scalar part of the @xmath205 operator to change sign under cp . on the contrary ,",
    "the operator @xmath208 contains two bosons ; thus two changes of sign that counteract each other .",
    "therefore , it is the scalar part of @xmath208 that is cp even . in table 1",
    "we summarize in detail the discrete c , p and cp symmetries of the above operators .    as for the size of these effective operators , based on the naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) their coefficients are of order @xmath209 , where @xmath50 is the cut - off scale of the effective theory .",

    "the _ no - higgs _ sm predicts about 100 @xmath266 pairs , with an invariant mass between 800 gev and 1100 gev , via the @xmath235 fusion process .",
    "let us assume that @xmath267 , and that @xmath252 can be measured to about @xmath268 , then an agreement between data and the _ no - higgs _ sm prediction ( @xmath269 at tree level ) would imply @xmath270 .",
    "if the fermion mass generation is closely related to the ewsb mechanism , one expects some residual effects of this mechanism to appear in accordance with the mass hierarchy .",
    "since the mass of top quark is heavy , it is likely that the interactions of the top quark can deviate largely from the sm predictions . in this study , we have applied the electroweak chiral lagrangian to probe new physics beyond the sm by studying the couplings of the top quark to gauge bosons .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to only consider the interactions of the top and bottom quarks and not the flavor changing neutral currents that involve the other light quarks . also , motivated by low energy data , we assume that the coupling of @xmath12-@xmath26-@xmath26 is not strongly modified by new physics .    in section 2",
    ", we introduced the dimension 4 non - linear chiral lagrangian that contains the _ no - higgs _ sm and the four unknown effective coefficients . among them , two represent the non - standard couplings associated with the left- and right - handed charged currents @xmath271 and @xmath272 , and two more for the anomalous left- and right - handed neutral currents @xmath273 and @xmath274 . constrains for these coefficients have been found using precision lep / slc data @xcite . in particular , under the assumption that the vertex is not modified at tree level , @xmath273 is bound within 0 and 0.15 ( @xmath275 ) . on the other hand , although @xmath274 and @xmath271 are allowed to vary in the full range of @xmath276 , the precision lep / slc data do impose some correlations among @xmath273 , @xmath274 , and @xmath271 . as for @xmath272 , this coupling does not contribute to the lep / slc observables of interest in the limit of @xmath277 , but it can be constrained independently by using the cleo measurement of @xmath278 : @xmath279 @xcite . at the upgraded tevatron ( run - ii ) and",
    "the lhc , @xmath271 and @xmath272 can be further tested by studying the production and the decay of the top quarks while @xmath273 and @xmath274 can be better measured at the lc .    if a strong dynamics of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism can largely modify the dimension 4 anomalous couplings , it is natural to ask whether the same dynamics can also give large dimension 5 anomalous couplings . in the framework of the electroweak chiral lagrangian",
    ", we have found that there are 19 independent dimension five operators associated with the top quark and the bottom quark system .",
    "their leading contributions to the helicity amplitudes for @xmath280 processes are given in appendices b and c. the high energy behavior of the above scattering processes due to the dimension 5 operators , two powers in @xmath281 above the _ no - higgs _ sm , provides a good opportunity to test these operators on the production of @xmath282 pairs or single-@xmath25 or @xmath32 events in high energy collisions . since , in the high energy regime , a longitudinal gauge boson is equivalent to the corresponding would - be goldstone boson , the production of top quarks via @xmath4 fusions shall probe the part of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector which modifies the top quark interactions . since the dimension 4 anomalous couplings @xmath13 s can be well measured at the scale of @xmath76 or @xmath47 , we expect that their values will be already known by the time data is available for the study of @xmath4 fusion processes in the tev region . hence , to simplify our discussion on the accuracy of the measurement of the dimension 5 anomalous couplings at future colliders ,",
    "we have taken the dimension 4 anomalous couplings to be zero for this part of the study .",
    "also we have considered a special class of new physics effects in which an underlying custodial @xmath283 symmetry is assumed that gets broken in such a way as to keep the couplings of the @xmath12-@xmath26-@xmath26 unaltered .",
    "this approximate custodial symmetry then relates some of the coefficients of the anomalous operators , reducing the number of independent coefficients from 19 down to 6 only .",
    "then we study the contributions of these couplings to the production rates of the top quark at the lhc and the lc .",
    "we find that for the leading contributions at high energies , only the s- and p - partial wave amplitudes are modified by these anomalous couplings .",
    "if the magnitudes of the coefficients of the anomalous dimension 5 operators are allowed to be as large as @xmath52 ( as suggested by the naive dimensional analysis @xcite ) , then we will be able to make an unmistakable identification of their effects to the production rates of top quarks via the longitudinal weak boson fusions .",
    "however , if the measurement of the top quark production rate is found to agree with the sm prediction , then one can bound these coefficients to be at most of order @xmath5 .",
    "this is about a factor @xmath284 more stringent than in the case of the study of nlo bosonic operators via the @xmath6 scattering processes @xcite .",
    "hence , for those models of electroweak symmetry breaking for which the naive dimensional analysis gives the correct size for the coefficients of dimension 5 effective operators , the top quark production via @xmath4 fusions can be a more sensitive probe to ewsb than the longitudinal gauge boson pair production via @xmath4 fusions which is commonly studied . for completeness , we also briefly discuss how to study the cp - odd operators by measuring cp - odd observables .",
    "in particular , we study their effects on the transverse ( relative to the scattering plane of @xmath285 ) polarization of the top quark .    in conclusion",
    ", the production of top quarks via @xmath4 fusions at the lhc and the lc should be carefully studied when data is available because it can be sensitive to the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism , even more than the commonly studied @xmath6 processes in some models of strong dynamics .",

    "<S> a complete characterization of all the possible effective interactions up to dimension 5 of the top and bottom quarks with the electroweak gauge bosons have been made within the context of the non - linear chiral lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> the dimension 5 operators ( 19 in total ) can contribute to the @xmath0 or @xmath1 amplitudes with a leading energy power of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) for fermion pairs with same ( opposite ) sign helicities . because of the equivalence between the longitudinal weak boson and the corresponding would - be goldstone boson in high energy collisions ( goldstone equivalence theorem ) , they are sensitive to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the top quark production rates at the lhc and the lc via @xmath4 fusion processes . at the lc , </S>",
    "<S> if no anomalous production rate is found , these coefficients can be bound ( based on the naive dimensional analysis ) to be of order @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is about an order of magnitude more stringent than the bounds for the next - to - leading order bosonic operators commonly studied in @xmath6 scatterings . </S>",
    "<S> the effects on a cp - odd observable are also briefly discussed .    </S>",
