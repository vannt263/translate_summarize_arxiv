    "the essential ingredient of time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite , the exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential @xmath0 , is frequently obtained using the adiabatic local - density approximation ( alda ) : @xmath1}{d\\bar{n}}\\right|_{\\bar{n } = n({\\bf r},t ) } , \\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the xc energy per particle of a homogeneous electron gas of density @xmath3 .",
    "the adiabatic approximation means that all functional dependence of @xmath0 on prior time - dependent densities @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is ignored .",
    "neglecting the retardation implies frequency - independent and real xc kernels in linear response .",
    "this approach has been widely used in quantum chemistry for calculating molecular excitation energies @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic approximation is known to work well for excitation processes in many - body systems that have a direct counterpart in the kohn - sham system , such as atomic and molecular single - particle excitations . on the other hand , for more complicated processes such as double or charge - transfer excitations the alda can fail dramatically @xcite .",
    "a recent study @xcite has shown that the alda can completely break down in dynamical processes where the electronic density rapidly undergoes large deformations .",
    "several recent papers have addressed the question how the lda for ground - state calculations should be properly extended into the dynamical regime @xcite .",
    "vignale and kohn @xcite showed that a nonadiabatic _ local _ approximation for exchange and correlation requires the time - dependent _ current _ @xmath6 as basic variable ( c - tddft ) .",
    "this formalism was later recast in the language of hydrodynamics , where xc effects beyond the alda appear as viscoelastic stresses in the electron liquid @xcite .",

    "- tddft was the work by van faassen _",
    "@xcite who calculated static axial polarizabilities in molecular chains , with much improvement over the alda .",
    "the c - tddft formalism has recently been applied to describe linear and nonlinear charge - density oscillations in quantum wells by solving the time - dependent kohn - sham ( tdks ) equation @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the retardation caused by the memory of the xc potential has the striking consequence of introducing decoherence and energy relaxation , i.e. , the oscillating density experiences a damping .",
    "the mechanism causing this behavior has been discussed by dagosta and vignale @xcite .",
    "technically , dissipation arises in c - tddft from a velocity - dependent xc ( vector ) potential which breaks the time - reversal invariance of the tdks hamiltonian . as a result",
    ", a system tends to relax from a nonequilibrium initial state to an equilibrium final state with higher entropy .",
    "but where does the dissipated energy go ?",
    "because the system is closed and isolated ( there is no coupling to a thermal bath ) , the _ total _ energy should be conserved . according to ref . ,",
    "dissipation in c - tddft has to be understood in the sense that energy is redistributed between two subsystems with different sets of electronic degrees of freedom , coupled by coulomb interactions . in the quantum well examples of refs . and",
    ", the transfer of energy occurs from a collective motion along the confinement direction into low - lying lateral excitations of the two - dimensional electron gas in the quantum well plane .",
    "however , in c - tddft this transfer process is never directly observed , since the tdks equations are solved only for the electron dynamics perpendicular to the quantum well plane .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to give an explicit , pedagogical illustration of the road towards dissipation in collective electronic motion .",
    "we will consider a two - electron model system that is simple enough so that its dynamics can be treated numerically exactly via solution of the full time - dependent schrdinger equation , and compare it with tddft within and beyond the alda .",
    "in particular , we will focus on charge - density oscillations along one direction of the system , and how the exact calculations show that the amplitude of these oscillations changes over time .",
    "this amplitude modulation comes from a superposition of transitions between the ground state and singly excited states and between singly and doubly excited states , including a coupling to the transverse degrees of freedom due to coulomb interactions .    in alda ,",
    "all effects involving multiple excitations are completely absent ; in c - tddft , multiple excitations are implicitly included , but for finite systems their contribution is strongly exaggerated , producing an unphysical damping . based on the insights of our simple two - electron system , we will discuss how the dissipative behavior emerges in the thermodynamic ( large - system ) limit , and to what extent it is then correctly described by c - tddft .    in section [ sec : model ] we give the technical details of our two - electron model system and describe how the full schrdinger equation and the tdks equations with and without memory are solved .",

    "@xcite , the history - dependence of @xmath149 , which is governed by the memory kernel @xmath150 , is such that it accounts for both dissipative and elastic properties of the electron liquid .",
    "the microscopic properties of the many - body system enter through the frequency - dependent xc kernel of the homogeneous electron gas , @xmath151 .",
    "this function describes dynamical processes of the homogeneous electron gas that go beyond single - particle excitations , i.e. , @xmath151 contains the physics of multiple particle - hole excitations . in principle , this should be a good thing , since we have seen from our model that the main defect of the alda is the absence of double excitations .",
    "but in spite of this , the alda+m does not work in our system .",
    "how can one understand this ?",
    "the central reason for the failure of the alda+m for finite systems is the fact that it is based on the homogeneous electron gas , i.e. , a reference system of infinite extent .",
    "since it is a local functional , the potential @xmath152 has exactly the same value at some position @xmath13 of our quantum strip as it would have if the strip were infinitely long , but with the _ same _ electron density @xmath153 .",
    "thus , by construction , alda+m treats all systems locally as if they were infinite , even if they re not .",
    "we can carry out the thought experiment of increasing the length @xmath7 of the strip , and simultaneously adding electrons to keep the same @xmath153 as for the two - electron system .",
    "the alda and the alda+m xc potentials would be unchanged , likewise the hartree potential , and we would find exactly the same charge - density oscillations across the strip",
    ". in particular , the damping in alda+m would be the same , irrespective of the length of the strip .    on the other hand , the dynamics of the exact many - body system will change dramatically if we increase both @xmath7 and the particle number .",
    "the time - dependent many - body wave function will contain not only single and double excitations , but a vast number of multiple excitations .",
    "the density of levels in the excitation spectrum will grow , and eventually turn into a continuum .",
    "recall that for the two - electron system , we explained the periodic amplitude modulation of the charge - density oscillation through a superposition of two frequencies associated with the dominant single and double excitation .",
    "if the system size grows , many more such transitions will play a role , and we will have to form a coherent superposition of many close - lying oscillators .",
    "the resulting beating pattern will become more complex , and seems difficult to predict .",
    "however , we can get a clue from comparing the case of @xmath60 and @xmath90 .",
    "for the longer strip , the modulation period increases , i.e. , the recurrence time becomes longer . in the limit of infinite system size",
    ", this suggests that the recurrence time will in fact become infinite . in other words ,",
    "the charge - density oscillations will be irreversibly damped .",
    "but where does the energy go ? in the free charge - density oscillations considered here , the wave function can be expressed as a linear superposition of field - free many - body states , each of which carrying a time - dependent phase @xmath154 [ this is a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ fieldfreeexp ] ) to @xmath155 particles ] .",
    "thus , the energy is , from the very beginning when the oscillation is triggered , shared in a fixed manner among all excited - state configurations that make up the time - dependent many - body wave function . in turn , the charge - density oscillation is a coherent superposition of a continuum of single and multiple particle - hole excitations , which steadily run out of phase .",
    "this reduces the amplitude of the collective mode due to destructive interference .    to give a simple illustration , consider the case of an exponential damping , @xmath156",
    "we can carry out a fourier analysis of the spectral content of @xmath89 , and the result is that @xmath89 arises from a superposition of a continuum of oscillators whose frequency distribution has a lorentzian shape of half - width @xmath157 centered around @xmath158 .    the alda+m functional of c - tddft , per construction , becomes exact in the limit of an extended system whose ground - state density , as well as the inhomogeneity of the time - dependent perturbation , are slowly varying in space @xcite .",
    "for such a system , the damping of the plasmon amplitude will be correctly described . in the many - body system",
    ", the damping occurs through interference within the continuum of multiple excitations , but in c - tddft , it has to happen in a completely different way : the nonadiabatic piece of the xc potential acts like an external damping force .",
    "the outcome , i.e. the behavior of the time - dependent density @xmath153 , is the same .",
    "we have presented a simple two - electron system which has the appealing feature of being exactly solvable with modest computational cost , and rich enough to provide new insight into the problem of dissipation of collective electron dynamics . from the point of view of the exact time - dependent many - body wave function",
    ", plasmon dissipation occurs through a superposition of a continuum of oscillators , associated with transitions between multiply excited states , which slowly and irreversibly run out of phase .",
    "the phenomenon can be viewed like a beat , but with an infinitely long recurrence time .",
    "consequently , there is no loss of energy in the many - body system , and , in a sense , not even a re - distribution into other degrees of freedom .    from a tddft point of view , all we can say is that we have a time - dependent density which produces a time - dependent dipole moment whose amplitude steadily decreases .",
    "the exact tdks system accomplishes this through a nonadiabatic xc potential which acts like a damping force . as a result , energy of the ks system",
    "is lost , but this is the price we have to pay to reproduce the exact density .",
    "the alda+m xc functional of c - tddft has been constructed for infinite systems , and becomes exact in the appropriate limits @xcite . for finite systems , on the other hand",
    ", it introduces a spurious damping of electron dynamics .",
    "for example , if the method is applied to atoms , one obtains excitation energies with finite linewidths @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the static limit of the vignale - kohn functional @xcite seems to work well for polarizabilities of polymers @xcite .",
    "thus , more tests of c - tddft are needed to explore its usefulness for practical applications .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that a time - dependent xc functional based on the homogeneous electron gas can correctly describe the subtle aspects of the dynamics of _ both _ finite and extended systems that we have discussed in this paper .",
    "a more promising approach may be through orbital - based functionals such as the time - dependent optimized effective potential @xcite , which will be the subject of future studies ."
