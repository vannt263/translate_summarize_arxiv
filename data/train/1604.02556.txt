    "observations of super - horizon ansiotropies in the cmb ( cobe , wmap , planck ) have established that early universe underwent a period of cosmic inflation @xcite .",
    "such a period of rapid expansion can solve a number of cosmological problems , such as the horizon , flatness and monopole problems , and generate the initial conditions ( homogeneity and isotropy ) for the hot big bang evolution of the universe thereafter .",
    "it not only explains the scale - invariant and gaussian spectrum of density fluctuations on superhorizon scales but also provides the seed for the large - scale structures formation in the universe . in particle physics ,",
    "the issues like dark matter , hierarchy problem , baryogenesis and non - renormalizability of gravity etc .",
    "perpetuates and hints towards the existence of new physics beyond standard model . till date the most promising approach to address these key issues is local supersymmetry also known as supergravity ( sugra ) . in the framework of global supersymmetry ( susy ) , there have been attempts to construct higgs field driven inflation models in mssm ( minimal supersymmetric standard model ) and nmssm ( next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ) with or without non - minimal coupling to curvature  @xcite . within the sugra framework , the non - minimal and minimal higgs inflation model in mssm and nmssm",
    "are studied in  @xcite .",
    "apart from these sugra-(n)mssm models , there exist a number of inflation models in the framework of einstein gravity and modified gravity @xcite . in the standard slow - roll inflationary scenario",
    "if one tries to couple the standard model ( sm ) with einstein gravity , one finds that the sm higgs can not be identified as the inflaton because it has a very small self - coupling @xmath2 and light mass @xmath3 at planck scale .",
    "apart from this it predicts large amplitude of the gravity waves which is ruled out by the joint analysis of bicep2/keck arrey and the planck observations at @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "however , if a non - minimal interaction of the type @xmath5 between the inflaton and gravity is considered then for large value of the non - minimal coupling parameter @xmath6 , the inflaton can be identified with the sm higgs  @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath7 allows the self coupling to be @xmath8 and therefore higgs mass @xmath9 at electroweak scale consistent with the lhc experiment  @xcite .",
    "also this scenario predicts small gravity wave amplitude consistent with the observations .",
    "however , in this setting higgs - graviton scattering suggest the cut off in the theory to be @xmath10 which is much smaller than the energy scale during inflation @xmath11 due to large non - minimal coupling , and therefore this scenario suffers from unitarity violation problem . various ways to solve this issue",
    "are proposed in  @xcite .",
    "however at present , this model ( and the equivalent starobinsky model of inflation ) is one of the most favored models of inflation due to its small but observationally consistent prediction of tensor to scalar ratio @xmath12 .    in the context of jordan frame sugra embedding of mssm in presence of non - minimal interaction of higgs ,",
    "einhorn and jones demonstrated that , under certain assumptions , the slow - roll conditions are not met along @xmath13-direction ( @xmath13 being the ratio of two higgs vevs ) for non - zero @xmath1term and therefore slow - roll inflation can not be achieved . on the other hand , in @xmath1flat direction",
    "the inflaton potential is negative and therefore unsuitable for inflation .",
    "however they found that slow - roll inflation can be realized in nmssm in which a gauge singlet @xmath14 is added to existing two higgs doublets @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 jordan frame supergravity in a superconformal approach  @xcite with arbitrary scalar - curvature coupling is formulated in  @xcite .",
    "the einhorn and jones nmssm inflationary scenario appears as a special case of this formulation where they showed that a strong tachyonic instability @xmath18 in the @xmath19direction during inflation because the scalar potential in @xmath1flat direction has a saddle point at @xmath20 and therefore inflaton has an unstable trajectory at @xmath20  @xcite . later on it",
    "was shown in @xcite , that a higher order correction of the type @xmath21 to the frame function can cure the problem of tachyonic instability if , for @xmath22 , one chooses a very small cubic coupling @xmath23 of the gauge singlet in the superpotential .",
    "also the unitarity problem , which exists even in supergravity generalisation  @xcite of standard non - minimal higgs inflation scenario@xcite , seems to be resolved here .",
    "the possibility of higgs inflation in mssm in context of supergravity with large higgs field and fractional power potential has been explored in  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we study an inflation model in the sugra embedding of the mssm in einstein frame . as this will be a minimal sugra - mssm model , so there will not arise issues like tachyonic instabilty and unitarity violation during slow - roll inflationary regime .",
    "unlike the einhorn and jones mssm - sugra inflationary scenario , in this model , a @xmath1flat positive inflaton potential can be achieved by adding higher order non - renormalizable terms to the mssm superpotential @xmath24 . and to obtain the correct inflationary observables , the required flatness of the inflation potential can be achieved when the imaginary part of the neutral higgs component in the einstein frame acts as the inflaton .",
    "the organisation of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section   [ model ] , we introduce the model and calculate the @xmath25term and @xmath1term inflaton potential . then to constrain the inflationary observables , we derive the effective potential in canonical inflaton field basis . in section   [ inflation_parameters ] , we present the model predictions of inflationary observables : in particular spectral index @xmath26 and its running @xmath27 , tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath28 and constrain the couplings in the model from cmb normalisation . also we discuss the possibility of the slow - roll potential with respect to the field @xmath13 .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section   [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this model we consider the following khler potential @xmath29 k & = & 3 m_p^2 , [ kp1 ] and superpotential @xmath30 with higher order non - renormalizable terms w = ( h_uh_d)+ ( ) , [ sp1 ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are @xmath0 higgs doublets identified as up - type and down - type higgs superfields , given by h_u =    _ u^+ + _",
