    "it is known that this emission can vary extremely rapidly ( e.g. see gaskell et al .",
    "this variable emission from compact objects has been interpreted by several authors as being related to the presence of orbiting spots in the inner parts of the accretion flows ( karas & bao 1992 ; karas 1999 ; shahbaz 1999 ; stella & vietri 1999 ; doviak et al .",

    "we will focus on a new method based on the high - frequency time - resolved polarimetric observations which can constrain the intrinsic parameters of the sources .",
    "in the case of stellar - mass black hole candidates , the resemblance between the quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) time scales and the dynamical frequencies of the black holes near their innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) has inspired the _ hot spot _",
    "model ( stella & vietri 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "an orbiting blob inside the accretion flow will produce observable effects in both total and polarized flux . in the case of super - massive black holes ,",
    "the situation is even more challenging because the measured fluxes are much lower and time scales are much longer .",
    "nonetheless , it is expected that similar physical mechanisms act in both categories of accreting black holes and , after appropriate rescaling , can be considered by similar techniques ( karas and matt 2007 ) . in zamaninasab",
    "et al ( 2010 ) , we have discussed in detail how flux magnification and changes in polarization angle ( degree ) follow specific patterns in this scenario , and we probed such a pattern in a sample of the near - infrared ( nir ) flares of sgr  a*.    several mechanisms have been proposed for the creation of the hot spots , including the random variations resulted from magnetic turbulence inside the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) flow ( balbus & hawley 1991 , armitage & reynolds 2003 ) , vortices and flux tubes ( abramowicz et al . 1992 ) , magnetic flares ( poutanen & fabian 1999 , zycki 2002 ) or star - disk interactions ( nayakshin et al .",
    "2004 , dai et al .",
    "it is also shown that multi - component spot scenarios are able to reproduce the overall behaviour of the observed power spectral densities ( psds ) and their ( transient ) qpo features ( schnittman et al .",

    "2010 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will discuss a straightforward method which can be used for constraining the physical parameters of black holes ( or other compact objects ) which show variable polarized activity .",
    "the new method has several advantages in comparison with previous works ( meyer et al .",

    "we must note that this method , in its core , assumes that variabilities in the flux are caused by orbiting spots .",
    "normally , it has been reported in the literature , that such spots happen to be located at the isco . here",
    "we will consider other possibilities for the spot s location and show how they will affect the predictions of the model ( see doviak et al .",

    "2008 for detailed discussion about the spot model and effect of the position of the spot on the observed signal ) .",
    "we must also stress that the results derived here are dependent on our assumptions about the keplerian velocity of the flow and the magnetic field orientation .    .",
    "[ lag ]    in section [ time_delay_sect ] we will describe how the spot model predicts a time - lag between orthogonal polarization channels and study how these time - lags are characterized by the black hole mass , spin and inclination angle .",
    "a description about the available nir data from the galactic centre black hole and how they can be used to constrain its spin and inclination is provided in section [ sgra_sect ] .",
    "we also briefly discuss a possible way to apply this method to other sources , like re  j1034 + 396 . in section [ conclusion ] ,",
    "we summarize the main results and draw our conclusions .",
    "mhd simulations have demonstrated that in the inner parts of the accreting plasmas , magnetic - field dissipation moderates the field intensity far below its equipartition value ( kowalenko & melia 1999 ) .",
    "nevertheless , when the gas propagates and follows a keplerian flow , a mhd dynamo can generate an increased ( yet subequipartition ) magnetic field that is dominated by its azimuthal component ( hawley , gammie , & balbus 1996 ) . in this paper",
    "we examine fluctuations occurring in the inner parts of the black hole s accretion flow , very close to the event horizon .",
    "since our focus is mainly on radii smaller than @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the gravitational radius ) we have adopted a thin disk approximation while magnetic field is dominated by its azimuthal component .",
    "thin disk approximation was also chosen for reasons of practicability .",
    "it allows in a straight forward way ( low computational effort ) to repeat simulations for a wide range of free - parameters space . adopting a relativistic treatment of the inner keplerian region ,",
    "while considering certain aspects of earlier hydrodynamical simulations , we end up with a model where the gas circulates at small radii twisting the magnetic field inside a relativistic keplerian disk .",
    "to estimate the possible structure of the gas distribution within several schwarzschild radii of the black hole , we followed the investigation done by qian et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .    for the radiation mechanism",
    ", we assumed that nir and x - ray synchrotron photons originate from the relativistic electrons gyrating around magnetic - field lines inside the flow ( see liu et al .",
    "2006 , eckart et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 , 2008 , zamaninasab et al .",
    "the energy distribution of electrons is approximated by a power - law function : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are electron energy distribution function , lorentz factor of the electrons and its cut - off , respectively .",
    "thus we can define both the ordinary and extraordinary emission coefficients for each point of the accretion disk ( pacholczyk 1970 ; see also zamaninasab et al .",
    "2010 ) : @xmath5d\\gamma } \\ ] ] where @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the corresponding modified bessel functions , @xmath9 is the frequency measured in the co - moving frame , @xmath10 is the magnetic - field strength , and @xmath11 is the angle between the direction of the magnetic field and the direction toward the co - moving observer : @xmath12 in the above equation @xmath10 is the magnetic field four - vector and @xmath13 represents the direction of the emitted photon momentum in the co - moving frame .",
    "since the majority of the high - frequency photons originate from plasma very close to the black hole , the curved structure of space - time must be taken into account . in our simulations , we have used karas - yaqoob ( ky ) code for the ray - tracing ( see doviak et al .",
    "2004 for details of the ray - tracing method ) .",
    "light bending , aberration , doppler boosting , and frame dragging affect both flux and polarization properties of the emission .",
    "the ky code is able to calculate all the relevant relativistic effects for the kerr space - time . the observed flux density from the accretion disc at a certain observed frequency , @xmath14 ,",
    "can be computed as follows ( doviak et .",
    "2004b , 2008a , b ) : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the intensity , @xmath17 is the distance to the source , @xmath18 is an area element on the disk and @xmath19 is the transfer function which contains all the above mentioned relativistic effects .",
    "this function depends on the location of the emitter in the disc .",
    "the hot spot is modelled as an over - density of non - thermal electrons centred at a point orbiting at the keplerian velocity with a gaussian profile as measured in the co - moving frame : @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the vector pointing to the centre of the spot .",
    "we have chosen the typical value size of one schwarzschild radius for the size of the spots . for the underlying steady accretion flow",
    ", we assumed that both non - thermal electron density and the magnetic field strength scale as @xmath23 .",
    "since our analysis is focused on high - frequency regimes ( nir and x - ray ) , we have ignored radiative - transfer effects .    here",
    "we must note that some models propose strong deviations from keplerian velocity for the accretion flow . in the absence of an unambiguous theory for the accretion model",
    ", we have adopted the simple case of the keplerian velocity distribution .",
    "while our choice of a thin accretion disk reduced the computational time needed for the ray - tracing simulations and made it possible to cover a wide range of free parameters in a reasonable time , it can produce large discrepancies at high inclinations .",
    "for this reason , we have limited ourselves to inclinations less than @xmath24 .",
    "the dimensionality of the spot is also important for polarized ray - tracing along strongly lensed rays . in this case , many different magnetic field orientations could be encountered ( as seen by an observer who is parallel propagating his orientation along the rays ) . for high spin values this can produce substantial depolarization .",
    "our comparison with three - dimensional simulations with the same setup , showed that for inclinations less than @xmath25 and black hole spin below @xmath26 the deviations of the models are less than @xmath27 while above this values it can reach as high as @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ image ] shows the images of the assumed accretion flow at an ideal detector as well as polarimetric images at @xmath29 and @xmath30 polarization channels for a spinning black hole ( @xmath31 ) viewed by an observer inclined by @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 are the projections of the impact parameter of the emitted photons onto the sky . here",
    "we have assumed that the projected spin axis of the black hole coincides with the north on the observer s sky .",
    "we have used these images to extract light curves of the total flux and the corresponding polarization channels .",
    "figure [ lag ] shows the behaviour of flux light curves in 4 orthogonal polarization channels ( namely @xmath35 and @xmath36 channels ) for an orbiting blob located at the isco of a schwarzschild black hole , viewed by an observer inclined by @xmath37 .",
    "one can see clearly that each channel reaches its maximum at a different time .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is the strong doppler beaming as well as the light focusing .",
    "furthermore , the rotation of the polarization plane along the photon trajectory plays a role .",
    "the latter effect is particularly strong for small radii of the spot orbit ( doviak et al .",
    "2008a , b ) . as fig .",
    "[ lag ] shows , the time - lag between each orthogonal pair of polarization channels can be measured by cross - correlating the corresponding light curves .",
    "one can define another parameter called _ magnification factor _",
    "( @xmath38 ) which provides useful information about the properties of a light curve . here",
    ", the magnification factor refers to the ratio of the maximum flux density to its quiescent value .",
    "this factor is a measure of how much the flux is magnified by lensing and boosting effects .",
    "up to here , we assumed that the projected spin axis of the black hole is aligned toward the north on the observer s sky .",
    "in general , the measured time - delay between two orthogonal polarization channels depends on the orientation of the projected spin axis with respect to the north ( @xmath39 , vanishing at the north and increasing toward the east ) in our chosen reference coordinates . in order to reduce this dependency",
    ", one can measure simultaneously time delays between two pairs of orthogonal channels which are rotated by @xmath40 with relative to one another .",
    "since changing the position angle corresponds simply to a coordinate rotation , the images were originally computed only for a single position angle , namely @xmath41 . the time - lag associated with each desired value of @xmath39",
    "were extracted from these images by applying the appropriate mueller matrices .",
    "the main question which rises in this step is how these time lags ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) and magnification factor ( @xmath38 ) are sensitive to the changes of the global parameters of our model .",
    "the main free parameters are the spin of the black hole ( @xmath44 in geometric dimensional units ) , inclination of the observer ( @xmath45 , when the edge - on view corresponds to @xmath46 ) , orientation of the projected spin axis on the sky ( @xmath47 , vanishing at the north and increasing toward the east ) , and the distance of the blob from the black hole ( controlled by the parameter @xmath48 ; @xmath49 ) .",
    "figure  [ complex1 ] shows @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath38 as functions of the spin and inclination for a black hole of the mass @xmath52 in gravitational units .",
    "the functions have been presented for two distances of the spot from the black hole ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) while @xmath41 .",
    "we have calculated these functions for a wide range of acceptable values of this parameter ( @xmath55 ; with a step of 0.1 ) .",
    "one can see that these three different functions behave differently in the @xmath56 space .",
    "this allows us to use these functions as tools for constraining spin , inclination and orientation of the accreting systems .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ complex1 ] that our results are sensitive to the exact location of the orbiting blob with respect to the black hole ( see predictions for @xmath57 and @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ complex1 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no direct way to constrain that parameter .",
    "a lot of effort have been devoted to understand where the radiation and the stress edges of an accretion disk are located and how they depend on the different assumptions of the models ( beckwith et al .",
    "2008 , shafee et al .",
    "2008 , hilburn et al .",
    "2010 , noble et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ) . since it is not yet clear how and where spots can be created inside an accretion disk , we have assumed four different types of models for the spatial distribution of the spots as a function of distance from the black hole ( fig .  [ models ] ) .",
    "we have considered models in which the main creation of spots happens only around the isco ( model a ) , distributed over the disk with the maximum at the isco and gradually decreases with increasing the radius ( model b ) , distributed over the disk with the maximum at the @xmath59 isco ( model c , see shafee et al .",
    "2008 ) and an equal distribution for the probability of a spot being located anywhere inside the disk ( model d ) .",
    "we have used the product of the magnetic stress and energy dissipation functions from mhd simulations ( e.g. hilburn et al .",

    "assuming the isotropic probability of the black hole s spin orientation , a choice for the prior upon @xmath61 and @xmath39 can be made so that @xmath69 ( broderick et al .",
    "the prior on @xmath60 is chosen to be uniform , i.e. @xmath70 since we lack a complete theoretical knowledge about the spin evolution of super - massive black holes .",

    "therefore , bayes theorem gives @xmath71    as it can be seen , this is a probability density in a four - dimensional parameter space , which makes it difficult to be visualized directly .",

    "this makes objects like re  j1034 + 396 perfect candidates for testing predictions of the hot spot model .",
    "the recent unambiguous discovery of one hour periodicity in the x - ray emission light curve of this source is interpreted to be related to the isco frequency of this super - massive black hole ( gierliski et al .",
    "unfortunately , there is no polarimetric observation of this source available so far .",
    "the mass of the object is also not well determined ( the estimates vary from @xmath112 to @xmath113m@xmath94 ) .",
    "this source looks to be a promising target for future x - ray polarimetry if its mass estimation can be improved ( using reverberation mapping for example ) .",
    "we have investigated the general relativistic effects on the polarization properties of the emission from an orbiting spot inside the accretion flow around a black hole .",
    "we have described a method in which observing the time delay between the polarization channels in high - frequency regimes can lead to a constraint on the spin and inclination of the black hole .",
    "the method may also be applied to the x - ray domain for sources which are bright enough in polarized x - ray flux .",
    "we applied the method to several hot spot models that sample a wide range of parameter space .",
    "we have discussed how the probability for the spatial distribution of the spots can affect our results .",
    "this shows the crucial need for reliable 2 and 3-dimensional grmhd simulations of accretion disks concerning the exact location of the plunging region and the stress edge .",
    "the results of the application of the method to the available nir polarimetric data of sgr  a * is also presented .",
    "the results for this source are consistent with previous findings of an inclined accretion disk around a spinning black hole ( @xmath1140.4 ) .",
    "while with current vlt facilities the rate at which high s / n images in polarized flux density are taken can be increased significantly by a new method of observation , the next generations of nir and x - ray polarimeters should be able to exploit this method as a powerful probe of the metric around black holes .",
