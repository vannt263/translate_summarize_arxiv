    "elastic nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) scattering is a process fundamental to our understanding of the nuclear forces .",
    "this knowledge forms the basis for a broad range of applications from few - nucleon reactions to heavy ion physics .",
    "consequently , many experimental and theoretical studies have been devoted to the subject .",
    "since the measurements at , e.g. , lampf @xcite , the database has doubled , and global phase shift analyses now extend to 3.0  gev projectile kinetic energy for @xmath2 scattering and 1.3  gev for @xmath3 scattering  @xcite .",
    "measurements of polarization observables ( analyzing power , spin correlation coefficients , depolarization parameters and spin transfer triple coefficients ) at discrete kinetic energies up to 2.9  gev were obtained by the nnsaturne ii collaboration  @xcite . at lower kinetic energies ( 0.2 - 0.45  gev ) ,",
    "precise analyzing powers and spin correlation coefficients have been provided by the pintex collaboration  @xcite using the iucf cooler ring and an internal polarized hydrogen target . at higher kinetic energies ( 0.45 - 2.5  gev ) ,",
    "precise and internally consistent excitation functions , i.e. , differential cross sections @xcite , analyzing powers @xcite and spin correlation parameters @xcite , have recently been measured by the edda collaboration using the cooler synchrotron cosy and internal targets .",
    "these new proton - proton elastic scattering data are included in the new global phase shift analysis up to 3.0 gev kinetic energy with its most recent solution sp07  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of the nuclear force also has quite a long history . during the last decade",
    "a lot of effort has been directed toward deriving the nuclear force in the framework of effective field theory ( eft ) , especially in the form of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath4pt ) .",
    "this eft can be regarded as the low - energy limit of the underlying theory quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and inherits its spontaneously broken chiral symmetry . as first pointed out by weinberg  @xcite",
    ", the nucleon - nucleon potential can be expanded in powers of the @xmath4pt expansion parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a typical nucleon three - momentum and @xmath7  gev is the chiral scale .",
    "weinberg s idea has since been extended to several orders in the chiral expansion with @xmath0 potentials of @xmath4pt derived to nnlo in refs .",
    "@xcite and to n@xmath8lo  @xcite . at n@xmath8lo",
    "the description of @xmath0 data below @xmath9 mev is comparable in quality to that obtained in the so  called `` high - precision '' @xmath0 potential models @xcite , provided cutoffs in the range 500600 mev are considered  @xcite .",
    "however , the energy range appropriate for the @xmath4pt expansion is determined by the expansion parameter @xmath10 being `` small '' .",
    "thus energy regimes of @xmath11  0.5  gev and higher are not accessible by currently employed eft methods .    in the later 1980 s and early 1990 s considerable theoretical effort",
    "was directed towards understanding the @xmath0 interaction in the energy region between 0.4 and 1.0  gev , which is dominated by the delta isobar .",
    "these approaches may roughly be divided into two classes @xcite .",
    "firstly , there are the models based on a formulation of genuine unitary ( @xmath12 ) three - particle equations , explicitly including the @xmath13 scattering amplitudes @xmath14 [ delta ( @xmath15 ) resonance ] and @xmath16 ( roper resonance ) and usually employing separable potentials .",
    "the second approach is based on the extension of conventional low - energy potentials into the single - pion production region  @xcite .",
    "most of these are based on coupled channel calculations containing @xmath0 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 channels , and the single pion production is incorporated through the decay of the delta isobar doorway states .",
    "the main differences between the two types of models are the choice of kinematics , the description of the width of the delta resonance , and the choice of @xmath0 potential being extrapolated .",
    "more recent theoretical work on the @xmath0 interaction in the energy domain around 0.5  gev and higher was driven by the need of a better understanding of pion production in different reactions , e.g. , in pion photoproduction from the deuteron in the delta region @xcite and pion production in heavy - ion reactions @xcite , measured at gsi .",
    "the exploratory study of ref .",
    "@xcite investigates how well a meson exchange model containing the delta resonance together with a wood - saxon type optical potential can describe cross sections and polarization observables in the region between 1 and 3  gev .",
    "the authors point out that the polarization observables in @xmath2 scattering for energies above 1  gev are badly represented by the model employed .    in this work",
    "we want to concentrate on the structure of the nuclear force as revealed in @xmath0 scattering between 1 and 1.5  gev projectile kinetic energy , the so - called 2nd resonance region .",
    "this regime is dominated by low lying , well - isolated nucleon resonances",
    ". a better understanding of the properties and parameters of those resonances is now being pursued at excited baryon analysis center ( ebac )  @xcite based on photoproduction data at elsa ( bonn ) , jlab ( newport news ) , mami ( mainz ) , graal ( grenoble ) , and spring-8 ( hyogo ) .",
    "we want to study the influence of the lowest lying @xmath13 resonances on the @xmath0 data in the region around 1  gev , which is slightly beyond the region dominated by the delta resonance .",
    "we start from a meson exchange model and introduce the lowest order loop diagrams containing the @xmath15 , roper , and @xmath19 resonances into the model . in section",
    "ii we give the underlying interaction lagrangians and in section  iii we describe the resonance part of the potential and the parameterization of their width . in section",
    "iv we describe our data fitting procedure , and in section v we discuss our results obtained when successively introducing the resonances into the potential model .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section vi .",
    "for projectile energies in the gev range it is mandatory to employ a relativistic formulation of @xmath0 scattering .",
    "a suitable starting point would be the four - dimensional bethe - salpeter equation  @xcite , which however is very difficult to solve .",
    "the only successful solution for @xmath0 scattering including delta isobar ( @xmath15 ) degrees of freedom was obtained in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since three - dimensional scattering equations are more amenable for computations , so - called three - dimensional reductions of the bethe - salpeter equation have been used  @xcite . in this work",
    "we will use the reduction proposed by thompson  @xcite , which was also used in ref .",
    "@xcite . for completeness",
    "we give the invariant scattering amplitude @xmath20 as introduced by the thompson reduction : @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the invariant mass of the @xmath0 system , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 in the c.m .  system . redefining the scattering amplitude as well as the potential as @xmath25 leads to a scattering equation which has the form of a standard lippmann - schwinger equation with relativistic kinetic energies @xmath26 which can be solved with standard numerical techniques .",
    "the pseudoscalar pion provides the long - range part of the nuclear force and most of the tensor forces .",
    "shorter range contributions of the potential are being represented by the exchange of heavier mesons , the vector mesons @xmath27 and @xmath28 , representing the @xmath29 @xmath10-wave resonance and a @xmath30 resonance .",
    "the @xmath28 provides most of the short range repulsion of the nuclear force .",
    "the intermediate attraction is provided by the exchange of a light scalar - isoscalar  @xmath31\"-meson , which has not been directly observed .",
    "a recent reanalysis @xcite of @xmath32 data gave evidence for the existence of a very broad resonance at threshold with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , a mass of about 440  mev , and a width of about 272  mev .",
    "for a simple model which still can capture basic features of the @xmath0 interaction the exchange of @xmath33 ( 138  mev ) ,  @xmath31 \" ( @xmath34 500  mev ) , @xmath27 ( 769  mev ) , and @xmath28 ( 783  mev ) is sufficient .",
    "the coupling of these mesons to the nucleon is given by the following interaction lagrangians @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , denotes the masses of mesons with pseudo - vector , pseudo - scalar , scalar and vector character .",
    "if the mesons carry isospin , the field @xmath39 should be replaced by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are the usual pauli spin matrices .",
    "very often one - boson - exchange ( obe ) models also include the @xmath42 ( 547 mev ) and the @xmath43 ( 980 mev ) @xcite .",
    "however , if the scalar - isovector @xmath43 is included , there is no reason to not also consider the scalar - isoscalar @xmath44 ( 980 mev ) with similar mass , as well as the @xmath45 ( 958 mev ) .",
    "it is clear that mesons with large masses will contribute to the short range part of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "thus their effect is very small when considering low energies , and there they can in principle be omitted . however , since we want to investigate a meson exchange model at laboratory energies around 1 gev and higher , we include for consistency all strangeness - zero mesons with masses below 1  gev .    in order to introduce contributions from the nucleon resonances into the potential model",
    ", we consider the lowest order loop diagrams containing a resonance as an intermediate state . the first diagrams to consider are those with a nucleon and a single resonance ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath19 ) in the intermediate state . as a first step",
    "we want to consider here only low lying @xmath46- and @xmath10-wave resonances .",
    "these resonances can be on - shell at the @xmath0 laboratory kinetic energies @xmath47  mev for the @xmath17 , 1136  mev for the @xmath48 , and 1381  mev for the @xmath49 diagrams , respectively .",
    "these energies are given in table  [ table-1 ] together with the pion and eta production thresholds .",
    "the energy at which two delta s are on shell in an intermediate state is below the threshold for the @xmath49 intermediate state , therefore the diagram with @xmath18 intermediate states is also included in our calculation .",
    "the diagrams included are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    since the delta is an isospin-3/2 state , only isovector mesons can excite it .",
    "the only possible exchange mesons are then @xmath33 and @xmath27 .",
    "note that in order to fulfill the weak unitarity bound ( @xmath50 ) , diagrams with @xmath33-@xmath33 , @xmath33-@xmath27 , and @xmath27-@xmath27 exchange must all be included .",
    "the @xmath16 resonance has the quantum numbers of the nucleon and decays predominantly into @xmath51 ( 60 - 70% ) @xcite and to a lesser extent to @xmath52 .",
    "we consider here the exchange of a pion and in addition the exchange of a `` @xmath31 '' , which mimics ( correlated ) two - pion exchanges .",
    "the decay of the @xmath16 into @xmath53 has a probability of less than 8% and thus this @xmath27 exchange is not considered .",
    "the @xmath19 resonance is the only known resonance that couples strongly to the @xmath54 channels .",
    "the dominant decay channels are @xmath51 and @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "thus , for this resonance we consider only the exchange of @xmath33 and @xmath42 . again",
    ", in order to fulfill the weak unitarity bound , each of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] represents in reality four separate diagrams .",
    "the interaction lagrangians for the couplings to the delta are given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the rarita - schwinger field @xcite describing the spin-3/2 delta - isobar and @xmath57 stands for the nucleon field .",
    "the operator @xmath58 acts between isospin-1/2 and isospin-3/2 states and h.c .",
    "denotes the hermitian conjugate .",
    "the @xmath16 resonance has the quantum numbers of the nucleon with the interaction lagrangians given by @xmath59 in contrast to the @xmath16 resonance , the @xmath19 resonance has negative parity , and the interaction lagrangians are given by @xcite @xmath60    all the meson - baryon vertices described by the above lagrangian interactions are modified by form factors of the dipole - type @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the momentum transfer between the two interacting baryons .",
    "the parameter @xmath63 is the so - called cutoff mass and is determined by fitting @xmath0 data .",
    "we choose @xmath64 for all vertices with the exception of the @xmath65 vertex , where @xmath66 is applied .",
    "the nucleon resonances enter the @xmath0 potential via the loop diagrams given in fig .",
    "schematically , the contribution to the potential from these `` iterative '' diagrams can be written as @xmath67 here @xmath22 is the invariant mass of the @xmath0 system , and @xmath68 , @xmath69 the energies @xmath70 of the intermediate states , which can be either a nucleon , a @xmath71 , a @xmath72 or a @xmath73 .",
    "the transition potentials @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath76 and @xmath77 in ref .",
    "the transition potentials for the two @xmath78 resonances can be calculated in a straightforward fashion , since they carry isospin 1/2 .",
    "since the resonances have a finite life time , their mass is modified by the width of the resonance according to @xmath79 because of the finite width @xmath80 , the mass , and thus the energy of the resonances , acquires an imaginary contribution .",
    "the loop diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] then contain an imaginary piece , which describes the inelasticity of the @xmath0 scattering process above the pion threshold .",
    "the effect of direct pion production in @xmath0 scattering up to 1  gev has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , and found to be very small in comparison to pion production via , e.g. , the @xmath15-resonance .",
    "for the present purpose @xmath33 ( and @xmath42 ) production will be restricted to occur only via resonance doorway states .",
    "we follow here the same parameterization of the penetrability as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , @xmath81 here the momentum @xmath82 is the c.m .",
    "momentum of the @xmath13 system [ or @xmath83 system in case of the @xmath73 ] , and should not be confused with the momenta in the @xmath0 system .",
    "the parameter @xmath85 is fitted and chosen such that the product @xmath86 becomes dimensionless .",
    "we choose @xmath87  gev@xmath88 for all three resonances under consideration .",
    "the dimensionless quantity @xmath89 is the reduced width , and the penetrability factor @xmath90 is defined as @xmath91 where @xmath92 denotes the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the resonance .",
    "the functions @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the spherical bessel and neumann functions .",
    "thus for the resonances @xmath15 and @xmath72 with the quantum numbers of @xmath14 and @xmath16 the width is given as @xmath95 and for the resonance @xmath73 with the quantum numbers @xmath19 @xmath96 where the step function @xmath97 ensures that the pion ( eta ) production starts at the corresponding thresholds in the @xmath0 c.m . frame .",
    "the expressions for @xmath98 show that the resonance width increases linearly with increasing momentum @xmath82 and introduces a linear divergence in the imaginary part of the potential . since this does not seem physical plausible , ref .",
    "@xcite introduced an additional phenomenological form factor to the resonance width of the form @xmath99 so that eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.3 ] ) is modified to @xmath100 as already mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , the analytic form of the form factor is relatively unimportant , as long as the resonance curve is qualitatively described , i.e. , it peaks at the resonance position .",
    "however , at the energies we are considering , setting @xmath101 has only minor influence on the numerical calculation of the @xmath0 observables .",
    "even so , we choose to employ eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.7 ] ) for the physical reason already mentioned .",
    "the form factor is defined such that it is @xmath102 at the exact resonance position , @xmath103 , of the meson - nucleon system .",
    "the parameters @xmath104 are fitted such that the resonance width at the resonance position coincides with the experimentally extracted width  @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the resonance width is calculated as the imaginary part of the lowest order @xmath105 loop diagram .",
    "there a dipole cutoff with the same cutoff parameter @xmath106 as employed in the @xmath0 potential was used .",
    "since we consider only single @xmath33 ( or @xmath42 ) production , we fit the width @xmath80 to the corresponding partial widths as given in ref .",
    "however , the @xmath15 resonance decays with a probability @xmath107  99% into @xmath51 .",
    "thus , in this case the partial width is equal to the total width , which lies between 115 and 125  mev . for the @xmath72 resonance",
    "we use the partial width for the @xmath51 decay to determine the strength parameters .",
    "the total width has a wide ranging from 200  mev to 450  mev ref .",
    "we choose the value @xmath108",
    "=  391  mev , from ref .",
    "@xcite to determine the partial width .",
    "the @xmath73 resonance decays mostly into @xmath51 and @xmath54 .",
    "up to the @xmath42-production threshold , which corresponds to the @xmath0 laboratory energy 1253  mev , we only consider the partial width for @xmath51 decay , above the @xmath42 threshold we add also the partial width for the @xmath54 decay .",
    "the parameters we use for describing the width of the resonances included in our model are given in table  [ table-2 ] .",
    "we tested the influence of the width cutoff parameter @xmath109 on the @xmath0 observables .",
    "varying @xmath109 between about 200 and 1000  mev did not lead to any visible difference in their description .",
    "thus , for the @xmath15 resonance we used the value ( 200 mev ) given in ref .",
    "@xcite , while we for the two @xmath78 resonances we adopted an average value of 400  mev .",
    "the parameters in our model are the masses of the mesons and baryons , together with the coupling constant and cutoff parameters for the baryon - baryon - meson vertices . with one exception the masses",
    "are fixed to the values recommended by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite . for the nucleon mass",
    "we employ the average of the neutron and proton mass , @xmath110  mev .",
    "similarly , for the pion mass we use the average of the charged and neutral pion masses .",
    "the only mass parameters which are not fixed are those of the `` @xmath31 '' mesons ( one for each isospin channel ) , which we consider as free parameters .",
    "since most meson - baryon coupling constants are poorly known , we treat them as free parameters , which are allowed to vary within a certain range .",
    "we use the values of refs .",
    "@xcite as starting points .",
    "the only exception is the @xmath12 coupling , which we fixed to @xmath111 , according to recent measurements at iucf  @xcite and extractions by the nijmegen group  @xcite .",
    "all cutoff parameters @xmath112 are treated as free parameters and we allowed them to vary between 0.8 and 2.5 gev . a more detailed discussion of the parameters obtained in the different fits will be given in the next section .",
    "our goal is to find parameter sets for which our models give a good description of the @xmath0 observables , i.e. , total and differential cross sections , as well as spin observables , up to 1.5  gev .",
    "however , we do not fit directly to data but rather to a partial wave analysis , since in some cases the amount of data is rather sparse . as reference values we choose the said energy dependent phase shift solution sp07 from the cns data analysis center @xcite .",
    "however , we need to prepare from this solution a  data set \" that is suitable for our fitting procedure . first , since the imaginary parts of our model are already fixed by fitting the widths of the resonances to their experimental values ( see section  [ sec - resonances ] ) , the partial wave inelasticities @xmath113 are already given .",
    "therefore , we need to restrict ourselves to fitting only the phase shifts @xmath114 .",
    "also , since we keep the pion coupling constant @xmath115 fixed , we should not include higher partial waves in the fit .",
    "what constitutes a high partial wave is expected to depend on the energy considered .",
    "therefore , we divide the energy range up to 1.5  gev into three separate regions : up to 0.3  gev laboratory kinetic energy we include only partial waves @xmath116 as reference values , between 0.3 and 0.8  gev we consider all partial waves with @xmath117 , and above 0.8  gev we include in addition all partial waves with @xmath118 .",
    "however , since there are only very few experimental data points for @xmath3 scattering above 0.8  gev , we exclude isospin-0 partial waves from the said data base above 0.8  gev .",
    "in addition we need to account for the fact that the said energy - dependent solutions do not give errors .",
    "the absolute errors for each partial wave are estimated with a simple polynomial reflecting the errors of the single energy solution . in this way",
    "we try to account for the accuracy of the phase shift analysis , which varies with energy and partial waves due to different amount of available data .",
    "especially partial waves with small absolute values get a very large relative error assigned , since they would be overrepresented if only simple relative errors were used .",
    "however , in order to avoid obscuring the plots , these errors are not included in our figures . in all cases ,",
    "the assigned errors increase monotonically with energy and reach a maximum absolute value of 2 at 1.5 gev .",
    "we tested different error setups and choose the one giving the best overall results .",
    "all partial waves get similar errors assigned .",
    "however additional weight - factors could be included during the fitting procedure itself , e.g. the @xmath8p@xmath119 partial wave above 800  mev was assigned a low weight in the final fits . after creating our `` data base '' according to these specifications , we perform a nonlinear least - square fit using the minuit program provided by the cern library  @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the resulting model parameters and the description of the phase shifts and observables will be given in the following section .",
    "the resonances are added one - by - one to our model , starting form a traditional meson - exchange @xmath0 scattering model . this way the influence of the different resonances can be understood separately from each other .",
    "as a first step we consider only a meson exchange model together with the excitations of the @xmath15(1232 ) resonance .",
    "this is similar to the models used in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "our focus is to create an updated model to which we can later add the @xmath16 and @xmath19 resonances .",
    "thus , we first concentrate on the description of @xmath0 data up to 1  gev , the energy regime which is expected to be dominated by the @xmath15(1232 ) resonance .",
    "in addition we include the contributions of the mesons @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath120 , which all have a mass slightly below 1  gev and were not included in @xcite .",
    "the influence these mesons have on the description of the phase shifts is relatively small and the coupling constants are determined to be of the order unity by our fitting procedure .",
    "they were allowed to vary within the interval [ 0.0,5.0 ] and the fit always stayed within these boundaries .",
    "the @xmath27-meson tensor - to - vector coupling ratio was allowed to vary within the limits of 5.9 and 6.3 .",
    "the fit prefers a value of 5.9 , to which the ratio was kept fixed in the subsequent investigations . in the case of the @xmath28 meson",
    "this ratio is around -0.12 and of negligibly small influence .",
    "we thus fixed it to zero .",
    "we also studied the interplay between @xmath42 and @xmath120 by alternately fixing one and letting the other one float .",
    "it turns out that , for the description of the @xmath0 phase shifts , only the combined strength of the two seem to matter , i.e. , if one is fixed larger ( on the order of 5 ) the other one will go to a smaller value , closer to 1 .",
    "therefore we always choose similar starting values for both of them , and let them vary between 1 and 6 .",
    "both couplings stayed within this range .",
    "quark model prediction @xcite give slightly higher values , but do predict both of them to be of the same magnitude .",
    "for the `` @xmath31 '' meson we let the coupling constants , masses , and cutoffs vary separately in the @xmath121 and @xmath122 channels .",
    "however , the values for the masses always stayed relatively close together .",
    "finally , we investigated the sensitivity of the @xmath15(1232 ) couplings to the overall description of the phase shifts .",
    "in @xcite the value of @xmath123  0.35 is used .",
    "similarly , the @xmath13 model from ref .",
    "@xcite employs @xmath123  0.36 . on the other hand , quark models relating @xmath124 to @xmath125",
    "lead to values as low as 0.22 @xcite .",
    "because of this discrepancy we let the @xmath124 float between those two values to see if the phase shifts show a preference .",
    "in addition we also let the cutoff @xmath106 vary .",
    "the fit always prefers the lower value of the coupling constant and goes to the lower limit of the cutoff boundary , which was set for all couplings to 800  mev . after lowering that bound even further ,",
    "the cutoff @xmath106 stabilizes at values between 600 and 700  mev .",
    "our fit runs consistently prefer a small value of @xmath124 , so we fixed this coupling for all further studies to 0.224 .",
    "since we independently fitted the width of the @xmath15 resonance to its experimental value , this choice of coupling constant does not influence the size of the inelasticity provided by the @xmath126 contribution .",
    "a similar investigation of the @xmath127 coupling did not reveal any sensitivity with respect to the @xmath0 phase shifts .",
    "thus we kept the value for @xmath128 the same as in refs .",
    "@xcite and only varied the cutoff parameter @xmath129 .",
    "in total we varied 22 parameters in this model , which includes the @xmath15(1232 ) resonance as the only means for pion production .",
    "it is well known that models of this kind are able to describe @xmath0 scattering up to about 1  gev in semi - quantitative terms . a good parameter set obtained from our fit procedure",
    "is given as model ( a ) in table  [ table-3 ] .",
    "using those parameters we calculated @xmath2 and @xmath3 observables as function of the projectile laboratory kinetic energy . the total cross section for elastic and inelastic @xmath2 scattering",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as a long - dashed line together with the said sp07 analysis  @xcite . as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the inelastic contributions of a model of this type are not large enough to account for the experimentally observed ones . consequently the total elastic cross section is being overpredicted beyond 1  gev .",
    "this tendency can also be observed in the differential cross section for @xmath2 scattering in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , especially at the larger angles .",
    "a partial remedy would be double pion production , which starts to contribute above 590  mev .",
    "we will not attempt to include such amplitudes in the present paper .",
    "the differential cross section for @xmath3 scattering ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) is experimentally less well determined than for @xmath2 and data above 800  mev are sparse .",
    "overprediction of the @xmath3 differential cross section is only visible at the largest c.m",
    ".  angle .",
    "the analyzing power @xmath130 is shown in fig .  [ fig6 ] for @xmath2 and in fig .  [ fig7 ] for @xmath3 scattering . above about 800  mev the analyzing power for @xmath2 scattering",
    "is strongly overpredicted , especially for the larger angles .",
    "this phenomenon was already pointed out in ref .",

    "the @xmath135 ( roper ) resonance is the lowest @xmath137 nucleon excitation and thus the first nucleon resonance to add . since it has the same quantum numbers as the nucleon this resonance couples to exactly the same meson fields as the nucleon , though not necessarily with the same strength",
    "we are using the decay modes of the roper as guide to which meson exchanges to include .",
    "it decays predominantly into the @xmath51 channel ( 60 - 70% )  @xcite .",
    "a very crude estimate from the width of the roper resonance indicates that the @xmath138 coupling is about 40% of the @xmath12 coupling . in ref .",
    "@xcite , riska and brown extract an average @xmath139 from the width and derive an even smaller quark model estimate . on the other hand , a coupled channel model for @xmath13 scattering  @xcite uses @xmath140 .",
    "we choose a value close to the latter , since the overall effect of the iterative @xmath141(1440 ) diagram is quite small .",
    "the second largest decay channel of the roper is @xmath126 ( 20 - 30% ) and pdg gives a value of 5 - 10% for @xmath142 . to mimic the latter effect ,",
    "at least for the real part of the amplitudes , we introduce the `` @xmath31 '' meson , and choose a relatively small value for its coupling . during the fitting procedure this value stayed small and none of our fits reached the large value favored in ref .",
    "the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite introduced additional diagrams containing @xmath27 and @xmath28 exchange in the iterative @xmath141(1440 ) diagram , though with relatively small coupling constants . as a test we included the @xmath28 meson , but",
    "since the overall effect in phase shifts and observables is minimal , we did not pursue the inclusion of vector mesons any further .    adding the @xmath135 resonance to model ( a ) , without refitting the parameters ,",
    "has only a moderate effect on both the @xmath121 and @xmath122 phase shifts . however , to obtain a true assessment of the effect , the model parameters need to be readjusted",
    ". a qualitative fit to the phase shift including the @xmath135 resonance is given by the parameters listed in table  [ table-4 ] .",
    "the results are plotted as short dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ fig3][fig18 ] .    a major effect of the @xmath135 can be seen in the @xmath122 channels , which now exhibit pion production at threshold .",
    "since @xmath17 contributions are forbidden , pion production close to threshold is provided solely by the decay of the roper resonance .",
    "overall , the total cross section for inelastic scattering is slightly increased .",
    "however , the contributions of the @xmath135 are by far too small to make up the difference with the experimental data . though the changes in the @xmath143p@xmath144 and @xmath8p@xmath119 phase shifts are relatively large in going from model ( a ) to model ( b ) , the final differences in the observables are much smaller .",
    "thus , the inclusion of the roper resonance has a small overall effect in the description of @xmath0 scattering .",
    "however , it is vital for the @xmath122 inelasticities close to threshold .",
    "similar conclusions were drawn in ref .",
    "we see in our fit that the pion - nucleon cutoff is slightly reduced when the roper resonance is included .",
    "thus we were tempted to see if we can force @xmath145 to take a small value , e.g. , 1  gev , and still obtain a description of the data of equal quality by letting the @xmath138 coupling take arbitrary values .",
    "in fact , it has been suggested @xcite that a soft @xmath138 form factor can be used in a boson - exchange model provided an additional pseudoscalar meson , with a mass slightly above 1  gev , is introduced .",
    "we find , however , that despite the roper resonance having the quantum numbers of the nucleon , the iterative @xmath141 diagram with pion exchanges can not assume this particular role , and we can not get acceptable fits with a very soft pion form factor .",
    "the @xmath146 ( s@xmath136 ) resonance has the quantum numbers of the nucleon , except it is parity - odd .",
    "thus the functional forms of the vertices have different spin structures , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : l1535pi ] ) and ( [ eq : l1535 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath146 decays mainly into the @xmath51 and @xmath54 channels , and thus we include only these mesons when considering the iterative diagram with the s@xmath136 resonance in the intermediate state .",
    "values for the coupling @xmath147 vary considerably in the literature .",
    "the quark model estimate from riska and brown @xcite suggests that it is slightly less then half of the @xmath12 coupling , while investigations of @xmath13 scattering give a value as low as 0.001  @xcite .",
    "a study of @xmath42 photoproduction from the deuteron @xcite suggests a value of 0.1 .",
    "our value of 0.05 obtained from the fit is well within these boundaries .",
    "the @xmath0 data are not particularly sensitive to this number as long as it stays around 0.1 . for the coupling to the @xmath42 meson we obtained 0.99 , which is higher than the value of 0.33 given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when including the @xmath146 resonance ( without refitting ) , its effect is most prominent in the @xmath143p@xmath144 phase shift . in general",
    ", the @xmath122 phase shifts are more sensitive to the size of its contribution .",
    "however , a true assessment should only be made after a refit of the parameters .",
    "this gives the parameters of table  [ table-5 ] , which constitute our model ( c ) .",
    "the observables calculated with these parameters are plotted in figs .",

    "in general , the @xmath1(1535 ) resonance has a tendency to counterbalance the contributions of the @xmath1(1440 ) resonance .",
    "a description of @xmath0 observables with both @xmath1 resonances is of about the same quality as the description containing only the @xmath15 resonance .",
    "only a closer look at the inelasticities in the @xmath3 phase shifts shows that these two resonances are necessary in order to obtain inelastic contributions in the region close to threshold .    comparing the parameters of model ( c ) , given in table  [ table-5 ] , with the parameters of the other two models",
    "shows that the coupling of the @xmath28 meson decreases when introducing the @xmath1(1535 ) resonance , indicating that this contribution has an overall repulsive effect .",
    "the @xmath27 coupling , on the other hand , decreases minimally .",
    "in addition , the pion cutoff , @xmath145 , assumes a slightly lower value .",
    "certain observables are particularly sensitive to specific phase shifts .",
    "for example , the analyzing power @xmath130 is sensitive to spin - triplet states . above roughly 800 mev",
    "the analyzing power is strongly overpredicted for larger c.m .",
    "angles , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for the @xmath2 excitation function .",
    "this effect is also seen in the corresponding @xmath3 analyzing power , however not as strongly .",
    "thus , one needs to concentrate on the large discrepancies seen in the @xmath121 triplet phase shifts .",
    "the most obvious candidate is the @xmath8p@xmath119 phase shift , which above 800  mev deviates strongly from the experimental analysis .",
    "the experimental analysis changes sign at about 1 gev , while the model predictions remain positive and roughly constant .    in order to isolate the influence of the @xmath8p@xmath119 partial wave on the observables , especially on the analyzing power",
    ", we replaced the phase - shift @xmath149p@xmath150 from our model above 800  mev with the one from the said analysis and then recalculated the observables .",
    "since the inelasticity agrees with the said analysis , we stayed with our model prediction for this parameter .",
    "the resulting @xmath2 differential cross section and analyzing power are shown as function of laboratory kinetic energy for c.m .",
    "angles 33@xmath131 and 53@xmath131 in fig .",
    "[ fig19 ] , together with the original prediction for comparison .",
    "the large discrepancy almost completely vanishes . in fig .",
    "[ fig20 ] the differential cross section and analyzing power at 800 and 1300  mev are shown as function of c.m .",
    "scattering angle .",
    "again , once the @xmath8p@xmath119 partial wave is replaced with the said value , the discrepancy nearly disappears .",
    "all the other observables are only marginally affected by this change in the @xmath8p@xmath119 partial wave .",
    "the description of the analyzing power for @xmath3 scattering at 53@xmath131 , fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , is also improved by the change in the @xmath8p@xmath119 partial wave , while the backward angles are not affected and remain reasonably well described . for higher energies",
    ", the @xmath2 analyzing power is a smooth function of the energy at nearly all angles @xcite .",
    "thus we may speculate that once the fast change of sign of the @xmath8p@xmath119 partial wave between 800 and 1500  mev wave is explained , the @xmath2 analyzing power can be described reasonably well .",
    "however , the present ingredients in our model can not account for a correct description of the @xmath8p@xmath119 partial wave .",
    "the efforts of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that a variation of model parameters close to our model ( a ) is not able to improve the description of the analyzing power as function of energy .",
    "instead , a different physical mechanism needs to come into play .",
    "a strong energy dependence in one single partial wave often indicates the opening of a new threshold in that particular channel , given by the coupling to another nucleon resonance .",
    "since the @xmath8p@xmath119 partial wave has a very strong energy dependence above 800  mev one may speculate that only a @xmath46-wave coupling to this partial wave can be responsible , which would require a @xmath151 resonance .",
    "the lowest @xmath151 resonances have masses around 1.7  gev and were found to be important for a description of @xmath13 scattering below 2  gev @xcite .",
    "consideration of either the d@xmath152(1675 ) or the f@xmath152(1680 ) would be possible candidates to explore this avenue .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effects the first few resonances have on the description of the @xmath0 phase shifts in the energy regime around and above 1  gev .",
    "we have incorporated the @xmath15(1232 ) resonance as well as the @xmath1(1440 ) and @xmath1(1535 ) in a relativistic meson - exchange model .",
    "we started with a model including contributions of only the @xmath15(1232 ) resonance , which we refitted to @xmath0 data up to 1  gev , and then added the contributions of the @xmath1(1440 ) and @xmath1(1535 ) resonances , now extending the fitted region up to 1.5  gev .",
    "we verified the characteristic deficiencies in describing the @xmath2 analyzing powers above @xmath11800  mev that were pointed out already in ref .",
    "we could isolate this defect as being caused by a poor description of the @xmath8p@xmath119 partial wave above 800  mev .",
    "this situation is not improved by including also the two @xmath1 resonances .",
    "we speculate that only a new channel , which couples with @xmath153 to the @xmath8p@xmath119 partial wave will be able to cause such a strong energy dependence in that specific partial wave .",
    "further investigations are necessary to investigate this assertion .",
    "we also find that , in general , the description of available @xmath3 observables seems to be better than that of @xmath2 observables .",
    "however , this finding may be too optimistic due to the small amount of @xmath3 observables above 1  gev .",
    "we also observe that the total cross section for inelastic scattering is underpredicted by about a factor of two by our models , indicating that not enough inelastic channels are considered . in ref .",
    "@xcite this was compensated for by introducing a spin - independent optical potential providing an average absorption . as shown there , this provides a reasonable mechanism to incorporate a bulk contribution to account for single- and multiple - meson production .",
    "however , such an optical potential will not be able to account for the strong energy dependence in selected partial waves , e.g. , the @xmath8p@xmath119 partial wave around 1  gev .    in this work",
    "the main effort was introducing contributions of two of the lowest @xmath1 resonances into the description of @xmath0 observables above 1  gev laboratory kinetic energy . in order to have uniform description of the widths of the resonances we employ the relatively simple parameterization suggested in ref .",
    "this can be improved by taking advantage of the recent work of the excited baryon analysis center ( ebac )  @xcite analyzing @xmath13 scattering in region below the 2  gev nucleon resonance region , and e.g. employing vertex functions and self - energies determined in the @xmath13 analysis in the @xmath0 system .",
