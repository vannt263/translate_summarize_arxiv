    "lattice simulations of technicolor inspired models are plagued by known systematic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "although the models under consideration are qcd - like in that they are four dimensional non - abelian gauge theories coupled to dynamical fermions the systematic effects of the interesting models ( those that are either conformal or walking ) are much more difficult to control than in actual qcd . as a result currently there are disagreements between various approaches , discretizations , etc , and universality is not immediately evident @xcite .",
    "clearly the general expectation is that once all systematic effects are controlled and taken into account the results from different approaches and regularizations will agree as they should .    in this paper a toy model",
    "is proposed which mimics many of the features of non - abelian gauge theories in the hope that systematic effects can be fully explored .",
    "hopefully these will help controlling the corresponding effects in the much more complicated gauge theories .",
    "the proposed model is the two dimensional @xmath0 non - linear sigma model with a @xmath1 term . at @xmath6",
    "the model served as a toy model of qcd for a long time since it is asymptotically free , features instantons , confinement and dimensional transmutation @xcite .",
    "it is exactly solvable @xcite even at finite volume @xcite .",
    "since the topological term is invisible in perturbation theory the model is asymptotically free for arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamics in the infra red is however expected to be very sensitive to @xmath1 .    at @xmath2",
    "the model is conjectured @xcite to have a non - trivial infra red fixed point governed by the @xmath7 wznw model at level @xmath8 and , if the conjecture holds , is also exactly solvable . some numerical evidence in support of the conjecture has been presented in @xcite and a recent very detailed study confirming it in @xcite .",
    "the infra red fixed point implies a zero of the @xmath9-function .",
    "this situation is analogous to gauge theories in the conformal window .",
    "for @xmath10 exact solvability is lost but based on continuity one expects that for @xmath1 not much below @xmath3 the @xmath9-function develops a near zero and the renormalized coupling will walk .",
    "this arrangement is analogous to gauge theories just below the conformal window .",
    "hence dialing @xmath1 corresponds to dialing the number of flavors @xmath11 in the gauge theory .    in all three scenarios ( confining , walking , conformal ) one",
    "may also introduce an external magnetic field to mimic the effect of a finite quark mass .    before exploring the analogies further and investigating the origins of the severe systematic effects",
    "the first task is to establish non - perturbatively that the @xmath1-term is actually a relevant operator and also what the singularity structure of the theory is for @xmath5 .",
    "this is not immediately obvious largely because of the unusual scaling properties of the topological susceptibility and a class of similar observables .",
    "it is well known that small size instantons render the topological susceptibility @xmath12 ill defined in the semi - classical approximation @xcite .",
    "going beyond the semi - classical approximation fully non - perturbative lattice studies have shown that regardless how one improves the details of the lattice implementation a logarithmically divergent susceptibility is obtained at finite physical volume in the continuum limit . moreover ,",
    "all even moments of the total topological charge distribution @xmath13 have the same property .    however , the model at @xmath6 is exactly solvable and both the exact solution and the continuum limit of lattice simulations agree that correlators of the topological charge density , e.g. @xmath14 are finite .",
    "the above two observations , namely that certain statistical properties of the total charge distribution @xmath15 are ill defined while at the same time correlators of @xmath16 are finite , might make one wonder whether the total charge operator @xmath17 is an irrelevant operator while @xmath16 is not .",
    "if so , the only consistent continuum value of @xmath18 would be zero and the apparent divergences in the lattice calculations would be regarded as artifacts .",
    "this scenario would imply that the theory defined on the lattice at non - zero @xmath1 leads to an identical continuum theory as the one defined at @xmath6 .",
    "equivalently , the total charge operator inserted into any correlation function would be zero in the continuum theory @xmath19 , while correlation functions of the type @xmath20 are finite .",
    "this scenario would of course invalidate haldane s conjecture about the equivalence of the @xmath2 theory with a non - trivial interacting conformal field theory .    in this work",
    "it is shown that there exist quantities built out of the total topological charge operator @xmath17 which have well defined continuum limits and are non - zero .",
    "these observables are differences of connected correlation functions of the topological charge , in other words the cumulants .",
    "each term is logarithmically divergent but the divergence cancels in the difference and moreover they scale correctly in the continuum limit to non - zero values .",
    "showing correct scaling towards the continuum limit in itself would not be sufficient to prove that the @xmath1-term is a relevant operator because the continuum limit value could be zero .",
    "since all cumulant differences are finite there is only a single uv - divergent parameter in the partition function @xmath4 but otherwise it is finite .",
    "while preparing this manuscript the preprint @xcite appeared also with the conclusion that @xmath1 is a relevant coupling .",
    "the method was different though , in @xcite it was shown to high precision that a well defined observable is different in the continuum limit for three different values of @xmath1 implying that @xmath1 can not be irrelevant . in the current work all simulations are carried out at @xmath6 and the same conclusion is reached by showing that certain combinations of the topological charge operator are non - zero in the continuum .",
    "the model in euclidean continuum notation is defined by the action s = d^2x _ s_a _",
    "s_a for the unit 3-vectors @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the bare coupling .",
    "only a torus geometry will be considered corresponding to a box of finite linear size @xmath24 which will be regularized by a symmetric lattice .",
    "the corresponding partition function , free energy per unit volume and topological charge distribution of the model at non - zero @xmath1 and volume @xmath25 is given by z ( ) = e^iq = e^-vf ( ) = _ q p(q ) e^iq , with the normalization @xmath26 . since physics is periodic with period @xmath27 in @xmath1 and @xmath28 is a symmetry the free energy per unit volume can be fourier expanded f ( ) = _ n=1^ ( 1 - ( n ) ) f_n .",
    "it has been pointed out in @xcite that in the semi - classical or dilute gas approximation all @xmath29 coefficients vanish except for @xmath30 which is uv divergent due to instantons of size @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the lattice cut - off and @xmath33 is the physical correlation length .",
    "the remaining coefficients come from interactions between instantons .",
    "semi - classical arguments also suggest that for instantons causing the uv divergence in @xmath30 the ratio between their size and their average separation goes to zero in the continuum limit .",
    "this would imply that the interactions responsible for the @xmath34 coefficients are small in the continuum limit hence will not cause them to diverge .    to summarize , the semi - classical approximation accounts for a uv divergent @xmath30 and finite @xmath34 coefficients",
    ". a suitable way of addressing whether this statement is true beyond the semi - classical approximation is to consider observables that can be expressed by the @xmath34 coefficients only and calculating them fully non - perturbatively .",
    "the simplest choice is to take the connected correlation functions of the topological charge , _ 2 m = ( -1)^m+1 . |_=0 and consider their differences , _ 2 m = _ 2 m - _ 2m+2 = _ n=2^f_n n^2 m ( 1 - n^2 ) from which @xmath30 drops out .",
    "the first few such correlation functions are _ 2 & = & + _ 4 & = & + _ 6 & = & .all of these are expected to diverge in the continuum limit but their differences are expected to be finite . some numerical evidence has been presented in @xcite in favor of correct scaling behavior for @xmath35 but whether the continuum value is zero or non - zero has not been discussed .    in the following",
    "it will be shown to high precision that the expectations from the semi - classical analysis indeed hold non - perturbatively and all moments @xmath18 and all cumulants @xmath36 are logarithmically divergent but the differences @xmath37 are finite .",
    "this implies that there is a single ill - defined constant in @xmath38 namely @xmath30 but otherwise it is finite .",
    "the constant @xmath30 can be removed by an appropriate renormalization condition leading to a finite and universal free energy and partition function for arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "it is convenient to take the continuum limit on a symmetric periodic lattice @xmath39 of fixed physical volume .",
    "physical length and mass is defined by the second moment correlation length @xmath40 @xcite , = ( ) ^2 ( 2 - ) where m_2n = ( ) ^2n _ t ( 2 ) ^2n c(t ) is given in terms of the zero spatial momentum projection of the 2-point correlation function @xmath41 of the field @xmath21 .",
    "let us introduce @xmath42 .",
    "note that in this notation @xmath43 is not the mass gap in finite volume but rather is simply defined as the inverse of @xmath40 ( which for @xmath44 agrees with the mass gap but not for finite @xmath24 ) .",
    "the physical volume is fixed to @xmath45 .",
    "a novel @xcite topological lattice action is used for the simulations , s = _ i , j s(s_i , s_j ) where the sum is over all neighboring sites and s(s_i , s_j ) = \\ {    l 0 if s_i s_j > +    . in other words",
    "the action is zero for two neighboring vectors if their relative angle is smaller than @xmath46 and infinite otherwise .",
    "the continuum limit is taken by tuning the bare coupling @xmath46 towards zero .",
    "this action is topological because small perturbations of the field @xmath21 do not change the action nevertheless it has been shown that it is in the right universality class @xcite .    if @xmath47 powerful improvements exist for the measurement of the topological charge distribution @xcite based on a generalization of the usual cluster algorithms @xcite .",
    "the topological charge operator from @xcite is used assigning an integer charge to each configuration even at finite lattice spacing .",
    "the continuum extrapolation of the cumulant differences will be done through 12 lattice spacings using the parameter values from @xcite listed in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the measured correlation lengths and topological susceptibilities are in agreement with those in @xcite . in the present work",
    "@xmath48 configurations were generated at each volume and every 10@xmath49 was measured for the topological charge distribution and correlation length .",
    "the large number of configurations was necessary because there are huge cancellations between the various terms in the difference of cumulants , especially for @xmath50 .",
    "the third difference , @xmath51 , was already impossible to obtain with the current statistics .",
    ".results for the first few cumulants and their differences for fixed physical volume @xmath45 .",
    "the bare parameters @xmath46 are taken from @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it has been known for a long time that the topological susceptibility in the two dimensional @xmath0 model is ill - defined in the continuum . consequently the topological charge distribution @xmath15 does not have a finite continuum limit .",
    "the semi - classical analysis predicts precisely what part of @xmath15 is actually divergent and what part of it is finite . in this work non - perturbative evidence",
    "has been presented supporting the semi - classical result .",
    "the only divergent quantity is the first fourier coefficient of the free energy density , f_1 = - _ 0^f ( ) ( ) , while the remaining part @xmath52 is finite and non - zero .",
    "hence the quantity f_r ( ) = f ( ) - ( 1 - ( ) ) f_1 is finite and universal and one may consider the subtraction an additive renormalization . similarly the renormalized partition function @xmath53 is finite and universal and related to the bare partition function by a multiplicative renormalization . instead of subtracting @xmath30",
    "it is sufficient to subtract only its divergent piece .",
    "the logarithmic singularity is expected to be volume independent .",
    "let us then denote this singular quantity by @xmath54 . since @xmath55 a suitable definition of @xmath54 is the logarithmic singularity in the topological susceptibility which can directly be measured in lattice calculations .",
    "a natural renormalization procedure is then the following : one defines the theory for non - zero @xmath1 by the action s ( ) = s(= 0 ) - iq - ( 1-())vf_1s and all resulting correlation functions related to topology ( i.e. derivatives with respect to @xmath1 ) become finite .",
    "the last term in the full action above is a non - perturbatively generated counter term .",
    "it is important to note that the above renormalization does not mean that @xmath1 itself gets renormalized , the bare @xmath1 is still a physical quantity which does not require renormalization .",
    "it would of course be very interesting to check the volume independence of @xmath54 in lattice simulations .",
    "the finite quantities @xmath34 and @xmath56 are not volume independent and are non - trivial functions of @xmath57 .",
    "since the model is exactly solvable at @xmath58 it would be interesting to derive the first few cumulant differences @xmath59 from the exact solution or at least their value in the infinite volume limit .    in any case",
    "the finite and non - zero cumulant differences naturally lead to the conclusion that @xmath1 is a relevant coupling of the theory and the total topological charge operator @xmath17 is a relevant operator despite the ill - defined nature of the moments @xmath60 .",
    "the original motivation was the study of a toy model mimicking confining , walking and conformal behavior in four dimensional gauge theories in order to study the severe systematic effects of the latter .",
    "it was proposed that increasing @xmath1 is analogous to increasing the number of flavors @xmath11 because as @xmath1 goes from zero to @xmath3 the model goes from confining to walking and to conformal . in the toy model a suitable renormalized coupling",
    "is @xmath61 which would then run with the finite volume @xmath24 .",
    "a necessary condition for this analogy to hold was establishing precisely the divergence structure of the partition function at non - zero @xmath1 .",
    "a particular difficulty of the gauge theory calculation can also be studied in the toy model .",
    "it is very difficult to distinguish numerically the following two cases : the theory with zero quark mass just below the conformal window and the theory with a small but non - zero quark mass just inside the conformal window .",
    "both theories walk , the former for the usual reason of being just below the conformal window while the latter because even though it would be conformal for zero quark mass , the non - zero mass drives the coupling away from the would - be fixed point as soon as the running scale goes below the massive fermionic states .",
    "this phenomenon can be mimicked in the toy model by considering it at zero external magnetic field and @xmath62 and also at a small but non - zero external magnetic field and @xmath2 .",
    "both theories are expected to walk and it would be interesting to explore in the toy model what intrinsic features are different despite the similar behavior of the walking coupling constant .",
    "there are a couple of differences between the toy model and gauge theory though .",
    "less important is the fact that while @xmath1 does not enter the perturbative @xmath9-function , @xmath11 does .",
    "more significant is the fact that due to the @xmath63 symmetry and periodicity by @xmath27 the two values @xmath64 and @xmath65 lead to the same continuum theory and it does not have an infra red fixed point ( for non - zero @xmath66 the coupling walks ) .",
    "this means that the zero of the @xmath9-function at @xmath67 is eliminated by arbitrary perturbations of @xmath1 meaning that this zero is a second order zero , unlike in the gauge theory where generically the zero is expected to be first order and is preserved by small perturbations .",
    "hence the @xmath67 model is really analogous to a gauge theory which is exactly at the lower edge of the conformal window",
    ". it would be interesting to find a simple toy model which possesses all essential features and in addition the infra red fixed point is a first order zero of the @xmath9-function and disappears by joining with a non - trivial uv fixed point as expected in gauge theory @xcite .",
