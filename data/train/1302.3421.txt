    "last three decades have seen a regular interest to explain consistently the properties of nuclear matter , finite nuclei and nuclear reactions ( nucleon - nucleon , nucleon - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus ) with an effective interaction that has the efficiency to describe the two body system accurately . in this context",
    ", the study of nuclear properties from finite nuclei to highly @xmath0 asymmetric nuclear matter in a given model is a promising area of current interest .",
    "relativistic and non - relativistic microscopic models such as dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) @xcite , brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) @xcite and variational calculations using realistic interaction @xcite are considered to be standard references in the regime of nuclear matter ( nm ) .",
    "the _ ab initio _ extension of these models to finite nuclei are still in a preliminary stage . however , an energy density functional based on the microscopic calculations of @xcite that reproduces accurately binding energies and charge radii of finite nuclei has been reported recently @xcite .",
    "mean field models using effective interactions basically adopt the strategy of fitting the force parameters simultaneously to finite nuclei data and nm constraints ( binding energy per particle , saturation density , incompressibility , symmetry energy , etc . ) .",
    "finite nuclei results provided by relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approaches are quite successful @xcite in order to describe the @xmath1-stable and drip - line regions including superheavy elements",
    ". some of these successful rmf interactions are nl3 @xcite , nl3 * @xcite , dd - me1 @xcite , dd - me2 @xcite , dd - f @xcite and dd - me@xmath2 @xcite . in the non - relativistic frame",
    "the skyrme @xcite , gogny @xcite and m3y @xcite effective interactions predict many properties of finite nuclei reasonably well .",
    "an important property of finite nuclei and infinite nuclear systems is the neutron and proton effective mass .",
    "however , mean field models predict neutron - proton _",
    "( n - p ) _ effective mass splittings in @xmath0 asymetric nuclear matter ( anm ) not always in agreement with the results obtained in microscopic calculations .",
    "for instance , rmf models predict that the proton effective mass @xmath3 is larger than the neutron one @xmath4 @xcite , which is contrary to the results of microscopic calculations . in the non - relativistic frame ,",
    "the skyrme ( with the exception of the _ sly _ sets @xcite ) as well as the gogny forces @xcite , predict @xmath5 effective mass splittings which are , in general , consistent with the microscopic result @xmath6 .",
    "another important property of the mean field models is the mean field generated by the effective interaction , which in general is density and momentum dependent . in the non - relativistic frame",
    "the mean fields obtained by means of the skyrme and finite range effective forces differ widely among them .",
    "the nuclear mean field corresponding to skyrme forces has a @xmath7 dependence that is not in agreement with the behaviour of the mean field extracted from the analysis of the flow data in heavy - ion collision ( hic ) experiments at intermediate and high energies @xcite .",
    "however , the more involved momentum dependence of the mean field provided by the finite range forces qualitatively agree with the behaviour extracted from the experiment .    in our earlier works @xcite , it has been shown that a mean field behaviour consistent with the experimental results can be obtained with finite range interactions containing a single form factor of _ yukawa _ , _ gaussian _ or _ exponential _ type .",
    "it was also shown @xcite that the range of these form factor and the strength of the exchange energy in symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) could be constrained using the momentum dependence of the experimental optical potential extracted from nucleon - nucleus collision data @xcite . in this way",
    "the different mean fields obtained with the aforementioned form factors have a similar behaviour over a wide range of momentum and density .",
    "this simple effective interaction ( sei ) has been used in several studies of nm , such as , momentum dependence of the mean field and the equation of state ( eos ) in anm @xcite , neutron star matter at zero and finite temperature @xcite and the thermal evolution of nm properties @xcite .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to show that this sei , able to give an overall good description of nm properties in the isospin channel , can also reproduce finite nuclei properties with a similar quality to that obtained using the more traditional effective interactions such as the skyrme , gogny and _ m3y _ forces as well as with rmf parametrizations .",
    "our study of anm with the sei , determines only nine out of the total eleven parameters of the interaction . to determine the two remaining parameters",
    "is a necessary task for a wider application of the interaction . in this work",
    "we have adopted the procedure of fixing them from finite nuclei experimental data .",
    "moreover , the knowledge of all the @xmath8 parameters of the sei allows to make additional nm calculations taking explicitly into account the @xmath9- and @xmath10 asymmetries .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that full hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations in finite nuclei with finite range effective interactions were performed first using the gogny force@xcite in a harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "finite nuclei hf calculations @xcite with the 3-yukawa ( m3y ) force @xcite were performed first using the density matrix ( dm ) expansion @xcite in the limit of the local fermi momentum approximation @xcite which reduces the hf equations to a local form .",
    "later on , both , full hf and hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculations have been performed with the m3y - interaction @xcite in nm and finite nuclei .",
    "an alternative approximation to the hf theory , which is widely applied to electron systems , is based in the kohn - sham ( ks ) scheme @xcite within the framework of the density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "we are aware that the application of the ks - dft theory to self bound system like nuclei is not obvious .",
    "however , it has been recently shown @xcite that the _ hohenberg - kohn _",
    "theorem @xcite , on which the ks - dft scheme is based , has to be reformulated for the intrinsic frame in the case of nuclei or other self quantum systems .",
    "the original version of the ks - dft theory is local , however , in the nuclear case , non - local contributions such as the effective mass and the spin - orbit potential are essential ingredients of the energy density owing to the momentum dependence of the nuclear interaction .",
    "the non - local extension of the dft was treated first by gilbert @xcite .",
    "later on , a modification of the non - local generalization of the dft and its quasilocal reduction were discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and we refer the reader to this reference for more details . in order to write explicitly the exchange energy in a local form , it is necessary to express the dm in terms of only local quantities , such as the particle and kinetic energy densities .",
    "this can be done , for instance , using the dm expansion of negele and vautherin @xcite or campi and bouyssy @xcite , or , alternatively , with the semiclassical @xmath11-expansion of the dm @xcite . in this work",
    "we will use this latter approximation together with the sei to build up an energy density functional able to describe ground state properties of finite nuclei .",
    "it is also important to point out that nowadays a modified dm expansion is used in effective field theory calculations with realistic interactions to write the microscopic energy density in a local skyrme - like form ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in section ii we present the theoretical formalism for anm with the sei containing a single gaussian form factor for describing the finite range part .",
    "the parameters necessary for a complete description of snm and anm are discussed together with the results . in section iii ,",
    "a general formulation of nm having all the three possible asymmetries , namely isospin , spin and spin - isospin , is given in order to examine the behaviour of the sei in the spin and spin - isospin channels .",
    "in section iv we build up an energy density functional based on the sei within the framework of the quasilocal dft . in the same section the predictive power of the sei to describe the ground state binding energies and charge radii of spherical nuclei is analyzed with some detail . finally , section iv contains a brief summary and conclusions .",

    "@xcite and @xcite ( see the former reference for more details ) .",
    "a similar comparison between our results and the ones provided by the sly4 and gogny d1s forces and the nl3 parameter set , but only for two - nucleon separation energies is given in table v. from table iv , it can be seen that our results are not so good than those of @xcite but similar to the ones of @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite the strength of the pairing force is fitted to some experimental data while in our case the pairing interaction is taken from the literature without any refit of their parameters to experimental data . the quality of the our predictions for two - nucleon separation energies also compare very satisfactorily with the results obtained from hfb calculations with sly4 and skm@xmath162 @xcite and d1s @xcite forces and the ones calculated with the nl3 parameter set @xcite .",
    "we have performed more tests to check the ability of the sei energy density for describing ground - state properties of finite nuclei . to this end , we have computed the binding energy and charge radii of 161 even - even spherical nuclei between @xmath225ne and @xmath251u .",
    "the difference between the theoretical prediction and the experimental value for binding energy @xmath252 and charge radius @xmath227 are shown in the upper and lower panel of fig .",
    "11 , respectively .",
    "in general , the deviations in binding energies and charge radii for the @xmath253-spherical nuclei are broadly reproduced within @xmath254 mev and @xmath255 @xmath68 , respectively , baring few exceptions .",
    "the overall _ rms _ deviation in energy and charge radius of these nuclei are @xmath256 = 1.5402 mev and @xmath257 = 0.0152 @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "these values are a little bit smaller than the corresponding rms deviations obtained with well calibrated effective interactions as d1s , sly4 , nl3 and bcp for the same set of nuclei ( see table 3 of ref .",
    "we have also estimated 303 binding energies and 111 charge radii of odd spherical nuclei , for which the experimental values are known .",
    "for these nuclei we find @xmath256 = 1.6501 mev and @xmath257 = 0.0198 @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "using our sei , we have also computed the isotopic shift of charge radii , defined as @xmath258 , in pb - isotopes .",
    "analyzing the @xmath259 values obtained with the sei , one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig6c ] that they lie quite close to the experimental values @xcite and that the kink at @xmath165=208 is reasonably well reproduced .",
    "it is known that skyrme and gogny forces use isospin independent spin - orbit interactions those are unable to reproduce the experimental kink exhibit by the isotopic shift of the charge radius in pb isotopes at the double magic @xmath224pb @xcite .",
    "this mismatch can be cured by introducing an isovector spin - orbit contribution as it is the case of the ski family of skyrme forces @xcite or using non - linear rmf parametrizations @xcite .",
    "however , the sei functional incorporates a spin - orbit contribution that does not contain isovector part ( see eqn.([eq23 ] ) ) but clearly shows up the kink without imposing it as a constraint in the fitting procedure of the functional .",
    "a possible explantion is the following .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite it is claimed that the development of the kink in the isotopic shift of the charge radius of @xmath224pb is largely determined by the occupation of the @xmath260 neutron level .",
    "this orbital has a principal quantum number @xmath261=1 and overlaps strongly with the majority of the proton orbitals .",
    "this produces a relatively large pulling of the proton orbitals by the neutron ones via the symmetry energy increasing the proton radius , and , therefore , developing the kink at @xmath262 . from fig.8",
    "we can see that the sei functional predicts that the @xmath260 lies close to the @xmath263 one and the same happens for heavier pb isotopes .",
    "therefore , one can expect a relatively large occupation of @xmath260 state .",
    "this fact together with the relatively high symmetry energy of the sei seems to be the reason for the appearence of the kink exhibit by the sei results in fig.12 .",
    "we shall now discuss in some detail the pairing properties of our sei energy density functional .",
    "this functional includes a pairing contribution coming from a zero - range density - dependent force that simulates the gogny interaction in the particle - particle channel .",
    "as far as the gogny pairing force gives a good description of finite nuclei combined with a reasonable mean field , not only provided by the gogny interaction but also by skyrme forces and rmf parametrizations @xcite , we are , actually , checking the single - particle energies obtained with the sei energy density functional . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we display the average gaps along the whole sn isotopic chain obtained with our formalism compared with the values predicted by a full hfb calculation with the gogny d1s force in both , particle - hole and particle - particle , channels . from this figure",
    "it can be seen that the averaged gaps , defined as @xmath264 and @xmath265 nicely reproduce the hfb values in this isotopic chain taken of ref .",
    "this result suggests that our model , with a mean field part whose parameters are fitted to anm and magic nuclei together with a realistic pairing force taken from the literature , is , in principle , well suited for describing open - shell nuclei at mean field level with a quality similar to that found using well known effective interactions or rmf paramtrizations .",
    "a possible way of estimating pairing correlations from an experimental point of view is through the so - called odd - even mass staggering ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig6b ] we display the odd - even mass staggering using a three - point formula @xcite @xmath266\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the sn isotopic chain ( upper panel ) and for the @xmath250=82 isotonic chain computed with the sei energy functional in comparison with the experimental values .",
    "our theoretical prediction of the mass staggering slightly overestimate the experiemental values in both , sn isotopic chaim and @xmath250=82 isotonic chain .",
    "therefore , some comments are in order . on the one hand , the odd - even mass staggering of experimental masses",
    "is not a pure measure of the pairing correlations @xcite .",
    "it also contains mean field contributions related to the rotational and time - reversal symmetries breaking not accounted by the simple blocking approach . on the other hand , the fact that the theoretical odd - even mass staggering overestimates the corresponding experimental values may be not so dramatic .",
    "it is known that when pairing is computed using the gogny interaction , the average gaps are larger than the mass gap @xcite . however , as discussed in this reference , effects beyond mean - field , such as quasiparticle vibration coupling , are expected to reduce the average gaps . finally to point out that in this exploratory calculation no attempt has been done in order to adjust simultaneously pairing and mean field .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonably that a slightly different protocol in the fitting procedure of the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 , for example including some open shell in it , would allow to find an odd - even mass staggering in better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "from all the discussion developed along this section , we believe that the reported calculations show up clearly that the proposed energy density functional based on the sei is a realiable tool for dealing , at least in spherical nuclei , with quality similar to that found using well calibrated gogny or skyrme forces or succesful rmf paraametrizations in the same scenario .",
    "we have proposed a simple effective interaction aimed to describe accurately the main trends of microscopic calculations in nuclear and neutron matter and , at the same time , to reproduce the ground state properties of finite nuclei with a quality similar to the one obtained using successful effective interactions of skyrme , gogny and m3y type or relativistic mean field model .",
    "our interaction contains a single gaussian form factor for describing the finite range part of the force plus a zero - range part that includes a density dependent term to simulate the effect due to three - body forces .",
    "our effective interaction depends on eleven parameters , nine of them fitted to nuclear and neutron matter data .",
    "the snm is fully determined by six parameters , which are three strength combinations , the range of the force , the exponent @xmath25 and the factor @xmath16 .",
    "two of these six parameters , the strength of the exchange interaction and the range of the force , completely determine the momentum dependence of the mean field in snm .",
    "these two parameters are constrained by using the optical potential data which imposes that the calculated mean field in normal snm vanishes at a kinetic energy @xmath267 mev of the incident nucleon .",
    "the exponent @xmath25 of the density dependent term is chosen amongst the values that gives the pressure - density relation in agreement with the experimental results of hic and @xmath94 production .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is fixed to avoid the supraluminous behaviour in nm .",
    "the two remaining strength combinations in snm are determined from the saturation conditions . in our model , the range of the force is chosen to be the same for interactions between pairs of like and unlike nucleons . under this restriction",
    ", the splitting of the exchange strength parameter in anm is decided from the condition that the entropy in pnm does not exceed the one in snm .",
    "the splitting of the two other strengths into like and unlike channels in anm are decided from the value of the symmetry energy and by imposing that the nucleonic part of the energy density in charge neutral @xmath1-stable matter be a maximum . with",
    "the nine parameters of our effective interaction determined in this way , the corresponding eos and mean field follow , quite closely , the general trends shown up by sophisticated microscopic calculations .    to describe finite nuclei",
    "we use this interaction to build up an energy density functional in the framework of the quasilocal density functional theory .",
    "in particular we use the semiclassical @xmath196- expansion of the density matrix to deal with the exchange contribution .",
    "this procedure allows to write the single particle equations in finite nuclei in a similar form as in the case of the skyrme - hartree - fock equations .",
    "we determine the open parameters of our interaction @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the strength of the spin - obit force @xmath164 by a simple fit to experimental data of three closed shell nuclei @xmath225o , @xmath226ca and @xmath224pb . with this choice",
    "the binding energies and charge radii of the standard magic nuclei are accurately reproduced . with our simplified interaction fully determined",
    ", we explore its predictive power for describing open - shell spherical nuclei . to this end",
    ", we add to our functional the contribution of a zero - range pairing interaction , taken from the literature , which reproduces the gogny neutron gaps in pnm . in this exploratory calculation",
    "we use the bcs approximation instead of hfb theory for dealing with open shell nuclei and the simplified spherical blocking approach to estimate the ground - state properties of odd nuclei .",
    "it is important to note that within this framework , the results for open - shell nuclei are predictions of our model as far as no parameter has been fitted to open - shell nuclei .",
    "we have computed the energy of @xmath253 and charge radii of @xmath268 spherical even - even nuclei in the mass region @xmath269 16 - 224 .",
    "our calculation reproduce the experimental values fairly well .",
    "the _ rms _ deviations of the binding energies i and radii of these nuclei with respect to the experimental values are @xmath270 mev and @xmath271 @xmath68 , respectively , which are slightly better than the same results for the set of nuclei computed using standard interactions such as gogny d1s , bcp , nl3 and sly4 .",
    "we have also calculated the one- and two - nucleon separation energies along the ca , sn and pb isotopic chains and @xmath250=50 , 82 and 126 isotonic chains . with our model ,",
    "the _ rms _ deviation of the theoretical predictions respect to the experimental data compares favourably with the results obtained using well calibrated effective interactions of skyrme , gogny and relativistic mean field type .",
    "we have also investigated the isotopic shift of the charge - radii in pb .",
    "we find , surprisingly , that the kink shown by the experimental charge radii at @xmath165=208 , is qualitatively reproduced by our model , in spite that our spin - orbit force has no isospin dependence , which is needed , in principle , to reproduce the kink with non - relativistic mean field models . we have given a possible explanation of this fact based on the small gap between the @xmath263 and @xmath260 neutron levels and the relatively large symmetry energy predicted by the sei model .",
    "in this exploratory analysis of finite nuclei properties described with our simplified effective interaction we have restricted to spherical nuclei .",
    "to improve the treatment of pairing correlations by replacing the bcs approach by a hartree - fock - bogoliubov calculation , and extend our study to deformed nuclei and some collective excited states is a necessary task to confirm the success of our simplified effective interaction that will be developed in future works .",

    "<S> the mean field properties and equation of state for asymmetric nuclear matter are studied by using a simple effective interaction which has a single finite range gaussian term . </S>",
    "<S> the study of finite nuclei with this effective interaction is done by means of constructing a quasilocal energy density functional for which the single particle equations take the form of skryme - hartree - fock equations . </S>",
