    "the motion of a particle in the field of many waves @xcite is a fundamental process in classical physics , the understanding of which is a prerequisite to the analysis of many plasma and fluid phenomena . in one space dimension",
    ", it can be described by the hamiltonian model @xmath2 where the particle with mass @xmath3 has position @xmath4 and momentum @xmath5 , while the force field derives from a potential with time fourier components @xmath6 .",
    "the wave field comprises @xmath7 waves , with a smooth dispersion relation associating a wavenumber @xmath8 , a pulsation @xmath9 and a phase velocity @xmath10 to each wave  usually determined by fixed properties of the environment , such as the geometry of the domain where waves propagate ( then wavenumbers @xmath8 and pulsations @xmath9 are discrete ) . the complex amplitudes @xmath6 are more easily tuned by the experimenter or affected by simple changes in the environment .",
    "the dynamical systems approach to this problem discusses the particle motion after prescribing a single choice for each wave complex amplitude .",
    "as it would be quite exceptional to control all waves ( though this is the assumption underlying the standard map , see @xcite for a discussion ) , physicists often turn to a probabilistic description of the dynamics , considering an `` ensemble '' of realizations @xmath11 .",
    "various arguments are then invoked to reduce the particle evolution equations to a stochastic differential equation , often driven by a `` white noise '' .",
    "this results in somewhat tractable models ( see @xcite about the validity of such derivations ) .",
    "in this paper we focus on two issues .",
    "first , a random field characterized by @xmath11 for a given dispersion relation with discrete frequency spectrum may be periodic in time  : may the force on the particle be considered as independent over several time periods in a genuine limit  ?",
    "second , may one consider several particles subject to the same wavefield as independent in a genuine limit  ?",
    "the latter issue underlies the frequent application of the fokker ",
    "planck equation to the evolution of a family of particles in a single turbulent wavefield  though a priori one can only grant that the diffusion equation describes the evolution of the distribution of a single particle for an ensemble of wavefield samples .    from a more general perspective",
    ", this work also relates to the issue of `` propagation of chaos '' in statistical physics @xcite , an aspect of hilbert s 6th problem  : how does chaotic dynamics enable a system , in which initial data are independent ( `` random '' ) but the evolution may generate correlations , to behave as if the evolution regenerated independence ( `` randomness '' ) or destroyed correlations  ? here , how do two wiener processes , fully describing a prescribed `` turbulent '' environment , generate @xmath0 independent brownian motions for particles  ?",
    "a further motivation for the present work is that physics literature most often focuses on the evolution of particle distribution functions , by showing that they obey a fokker ",
    "planck equation , and on instantaneous observables such as @xmath12 for given @xmath13 ( pointwise in time ) .",
    "however , the notion of a diffusion process implies rather a measure on the set of trajectories , functions @xmath14 ( globally in time ) .",
    "here we shall show how our model implies that an arbitrary number of trajectories in a single realization of the dynamics do , jointly , admit the wiener measure description .    in sections [ back ] and [ mainres ]",
    "we motivate the mathematical model more precisely and state our main results , which are proved in the subsequent sections . the crucial theorem [ theth ]",
    "is an ergodic theorem for a rescaled process , implying that a process @xmath15 , describing the relative velocity of one particle with respect to another one ( or to its own earlier motion ) , converges weakly to a brownian motion .",
    "the difficulty in proving the ergodic theorem is that the invariant measure of the diffusion process is infinite ( it is the lebesgue measure @xmath16 ) , and we must estimate a continuous additive functional generated by a function ( namely @xmath17 ) which is not integrable with respect to this measure ( it is only locally integrable ) .",
    "this weak convergence then implies the final many  particle result ( theorem [ npartgauss ] ) by a straightforward application of the lvy characterization of brownian motion .",
    "section [ persp ] outlines implications and possible extensions to this work .",
    "because the waves have different frequencies and velocities , it is generally unrealistic to assume their phases to be correlated .",
    "their intensities are more easily observed , but both in nature and in the laboratory the accumulation of statistical data on waves often involves only their average power spectra , not the detailed intensity data for each measurement run .",
    "we assume here that these complex amplitudes are random data , and investigate the statistics of the particle motion in the resulting time  dependent random field .",
    "this dynamics is a `` stochastic acceleration problem '' for a `` passive particle '' in weak plasma turbulence @xcite , and its understanding is a prerequisite to a proper analysis of the case where the particle motion feeds back on the wave evolution @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian generates equations of motion @xmath18    an important observation @xcite on the motion of a particle in the field ( [ dotv ] ) is locality in velocity  : the evolution of the particle when it has velocity @xmath19 depends only weakly on the waves with a doppler - shifted frequency @xmath20 much larger than their trapping oscillation frequency @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , for a two - wave system the resonance overlap parameter @xmath22 becomes unity when there exists a velocity @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "for many waves with overlap parameters @xmath27 , the relevant phase velocity range for waves influencing the particle is a `` resonance box '' , with a width scaling as @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite    a good approximation to typical wave dispersion relations in the strong overlap limit , after a galileo change of reference frame ( see sec .  6.7 in @xcite ) , is @xmath29 for some @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "then , in the limit @xmath32 , the equations of motion yield for @xmath33 ( with real @xmath34 ) the well - known standard map @xcite .",
    "the case where phases @xmath35 are independent random variables uniformly distributed on the circle @xmath36 $ ] , while @xmath37 is given , was investigated notably by cary , escande , verga and bnisti @xcite and occurs in the context of the random phase approximation .    to the extent that the phases and amplitudes of the waves are independent random variables",
    ", the physicist usually views the force ( [ dotv ] ) as a mollification of a white noise , with amplitude @xmath38 , where the relevant mode @xmath39 is the one nearest to the current particle velocity ( the mathematical expectation @xmath40 is called ensemble average with respect to wave amplitudes and phases ) .",
    "( nor in @xmath41 ) because the relative phase of two waves @xmath42 varies uniformly over time ( hence @xmath43 can be absorbed in the choice of the time origin ) . ]",
    "this is the core of quasilinear theory @xcite . with some care ,",
    "one interprets ( [ dotx])([dotv ] ) as a stochastic differential equation  ; this applies in the case @xmath44 for dispersion relation ( [ bespectrum ] ) with gaussian independent complex amplitudes such that @xmath45 .",
    "the particle velocity then has a brownian evolution , so that for @xmath46 $ ] @xmath47 with the quasilinear diffusion coefficient @xmath48 .",
    "however , the particle evolution for @xmath49 may show a strong correlation to its motion for @xmath50 because the waves are periodic in time @xcite , and the dispersion relation ( [ bespectrum ] ) may generate a strong spatial correlation between the motions of two particles because all waves acting on a particle at any time have the same wavelength .",
    "becomes a double sum @xmath51 and one varies wavenumbers @xmath52 independently from pulsations @xmath9 .",
    "this space - time stochastic environment is more noisy than our model and may also be considered to motivate a quasilinear approximation . ]",
    "set @xmath53 and @xmath54 by the choice of space and time units .",
    "the particle phase space is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the circle modulo @xmath57 , and the particle equation of motion reads , with initial data @xmath58 , @xmath59 in a galilean frame moving at a velocity inside the spectrum of wave phase velocities ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath61 , @xmath62 . for @xmath37 given and independent random phases ( uniform on the circle ) , in the limit @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , bnisti and escande @xcite",
    "have shown that the particle momentum @xmath65 follows essentially a brownian motion , with diffusion constant given by the quasilinear estimate @xmath66 as long as the motion does not approach the boundaries of the wave velocity spectrum .",
    "then the particle momenta @xmath5 for an ensemble of independent realizations of the system will be described by a distribution function verifying the fokker ",
    "planck equation @xmath67 even for @xmath49 .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite show similar behaviour for i.i.d.complex gaussian random variables @xmath6 .",
    "the present work establishes a rigorous version of this result in the frame of stochastic processes .",
    "we first let @xmath68 in the model , taking @xmath69 , @xmath70 as i.i.d .",
    "gaussian random variables with zero expectation and @xmath71 for all @xmath44 . in particular this",
    "implies that phases @xmath35 are i.i.d .  uniformly on @xmath56 . to follow earlier practice , we now set @xmath72 . then formally ( [ eqq2 ] ) becomes the stratonovich stochastic differential equation for @xmath73 @xmath74 with initial data @xmath75 , @xmath76  ; here , from @xcite , @xmath77 is a standard 2-dimensional brownian motion .",
    "in other words , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are martingales , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 note that the stratonovich and it integrals define the same solutions for this system , and that the vector fields @xmath82 and @xmath83 commute .    for @xmath84 ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath85 is a brownian motion for any value of @xmath86 ( see the first lines of sec .",
    "[ proofnpart ] ) . however , the model defines a dynamical system for all times @xmath87 , and one may wonder how the initial stochastic behaviour over @xmath88 $ ] extends for longer times .",
    "formally , one solves then  with the periodized field , with the continuous processes defined by @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "in other words , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are independent brownian bridges repeated periodically for @xmath93 , while @xmath94 and @xmath95 are independent gaussian random variables with expectation 0 and variance @xmath96 .    for this extended process",
    ", the wave field acting on the particle for @xmath97 $ ] is not stochastically independent from the wave field acting during @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "therefore one does not expect the particle momentum to proceed as a brownian motion for all times , and indeed for @xmath98 small enough the velocity @xmath99 may remain bounded in a narrow interval for all times .",
    "this is easily seen numerically and can be attributed to the existence of kolmogorov - arnold - moser invariant tori in the 3-dimensional extended phase space with coordinates @xmath100 .    on the other hand , for large @xmath98",
    ", the dynamics viewpoint @xcite suggests that the nonlinearity in the equations of motion ( due to trigonometric functions of @xmath101 ) may enable a decorrelation of the force over the period @xmath102 , so that the long - time evolution of the velocity would also be close to brownian .",
    "this is what we shall show .",
    "an intimately related issue is the relative motion of several particles , released in the same realization of the wave field . even though each particle velocity diffuses for @xmath103 $ ] , their motions are not independent .",
    "we shall also show that for large @xmath98 the motions of any finite family of particles released at initial data @xmath104 , @xmath105 , approaches a family of @xmath0 independent processes .",
    "this can also be expected from the consideration of the top lyapunov exponent of the dynamics  in the limit @xmath106 .",
    "[ npartgauss ] for any @xmath107 , the momentum processes @xmath108 defined by @xmath109 with @xmath0 different initial data @xmath110 , @xmath105 , converge as @xmath106 to @xmath0 independent wiener processes with variance @xmath111 , and convergence is in law in @xmath112 .",
    "the key argument in the proof is the following weak convergence theorem , where we write now @xmath113 .",
    "consider the two  dimensional diffusion process indexed by @xmath114 , solution of the sde on @xmath115 @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 is a standard brownian motion .",

    "this will be discussed separately .",
    "second , and this is conceptually more fundamental , for a single sample of the wiener wavefield ( with @xmath292 formally ) , with strong spatial correlations ( thanks to the single wavevector @xmath30 in the model ) , the limit @xmath63 leads to independence of the evolutions of all @xmath0 particles , which can then be collectively described by the diffusion equation . while such an independence is often admitted without proof in physics practice , our work provides an explicit justification to it .",
    "we even prove a little more than usual one or two  time statements , as in our limit @xmath293 is independent in law from even the full evolution data @xmath294 .",
    "this second implication is an important issue , as the acceleration of a passive particle is a hamiltonian process while the diffusion equation is irreversible .",
