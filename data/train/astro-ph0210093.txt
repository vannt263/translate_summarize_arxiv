    "over the past decade , gravitational weak lensing offered astronomers an observing tool capable to measure the amount and the spatial distribution of dark matter in the sky .",
    "weak lensing analysis can probe distortion fields of any specific gravitational systems , like groups or clusters of galaxies , in order to provide individual mass reconstruction of those systems . cosmic shear studies , on the other hand , probe the statistical properties of the gravitational shear ,",
    "relate them to the geometry and matter / energy content of the universe and attempt to measure some cosmological parameters and the dark matter power spectrum .",
    "the results obtained recently are reviewed in ( see , , , or in this conference ) and some of them will be presented in this proceeding .",
    "+ in this presentation , we only focus on the impact the vlt can have on weak lensing science . in order to answer this question",
    ", we first sumarise the present status of weak lensing and cosmic shear surveys , then we point out the main issues and future goals and finally we try to answer how can vlt help in the future .",
    "the distortion of light beams produced by gravitational lensing modifies the image properties of lensed galaxies . in a friedman - robertson - walker metric , and for stationary and weak gravitational fields ,",
    "the deflection angle writes @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the celerity and @xmath2 the 3-dimension gravitational potential associated to the lens .",
    "when the deflection angle is small and when lenses can be approximated as thin gravitational systems , the relation between the source ( @xmath3 ) and its image ( @xmath4 ) positions follows the simple geometrical `` lens equation '' : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are angular diameter distances",
    ". + equations ( [ deflec ] ) and ( [ lensequa ] ) express how lens properties depend on ( dark ) matter distribution and on cosmological models . from an observational point of view , gravitational lenses manifest as image multiplication of galaxies or quasars , strong and weak distortions of galaxy shape or transient micro - lensing effects .",
    "these effects , as well as the time delays attached to image multiplications are exploited in order to probe the geometry and matter / energy content of the universe or to observe high - redshift galaxies ( see , , , for reviews ) .",
    "+ the image magnification is characterized by the convergence , @xmath7 , and by the shear components @xmath8 and @xmath9 : @xmath10 where the @xmath11 are the second derivatives of @xmath12 with respect to the @xmath13 coordinates and @xmath14 note that @xmath7 is the laplacian of @xmath12 , so it is the projected mass density . + the shear applied to lensed galaxies increases their ellipticity along a direction perpendicular to the gradient of the projected potential .",
    "the lens - induced distortion @xmath15 can then be evaluated from the shape of galaxies as it can be observed from the components of their surface brightness second moment @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the major and minor axis of galaxies , as derived from their surface brightness second moment . + in the weak lensing regime , the relation between the distortion and the gravitational shear simplifies to @xmath20 , so in principle , if we assume that unlensed galaxies are randomly oriented ( _ ie _ @xmath21 ) , the ellipticity of galaxies , as measured from the second moment components , provides a direct estimate of the gravitational shear .",
    "the `` shear map '' can then be used to reconstruct the `` mass map '' at any galaxy position . however , since each galaxy has its own intrinsic ellipticity , and since the background galaxies only sparsely sample the sky , the final shear - induced ellipticity map is contaminated by shot noise so galaxy ellipticity must be averaged over a small but finite angular - size .    .",
    "the lensed population has an average redshift of one .",
    "the amplitude of the gravitational shear decreases with radial distance and far from the cluster center , the ellipticity produced by the shear is smaller than the intrinsic ellipticity of the galaxies .",
    "the lensing signal must be averaged over a large number of galaxies in order to be measured accurately .",
    "the zoom on the right panel shows the images of the galaxies in the weak lensing regime .",
    "the contours show their shape as determined from their second moments .",
    "the average orientation of these galaxies is given by the solid lines at the top right .",
    "the lower line is the true orientation of the shear produced by the cluster at that position and the upper line is the orientation computed from the galaxies of the zoomed area .",
    "the difference between the two orientations is random noise due to the intrinsic ellipticity and orientation on distributions of the galaxies ( from ) .,width=415 ]",
    "because clusters of galaxies are young and the largest relaxed gravitational systems they are surviving witnesses of the cosmic history of structure formation . their present - day mass function , its evolution with look - back time and their radial mass density profile are remaining footprints of the growth of gravitational perturbations over the past gigayears as well as physical illustrations of the roles of cosmological parameters and the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations in the cosmic scenario . + it is now well known that gravitational lensing studies of clusters of galaxies do not need to assume the geometry of the mass distribution nor its dynamical and thermodynamical properties . in this respect",
    "this is an interesting tool to study complex systems like clusters of galaxies . by comnining the previous equations , it is easy to show that the projected mass density can be reconstructed from this integral : @xmath22   \\ d^2\\theta ' \\",
    "+ \\kappa_0   \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath23 this inversion produces the mass reconstruction from the shear field .",
    "+ from a technical and practical point of view clusters of galaxies are attractive systems for weak lensing analysis .",
    "their mass - density contrast is high ( @xmath24 ) enough to produce significant gravitational distortion , and their angular scale ( @xmath25 10 arc - minutes ) is much larger than the typical angular distances between lensed background galaxies .",
    "the details of cluster mass distribution can therefore be well sampled by the grid of lensed galaxy population .",
    "+ over the past decade about 50 clusters have been reconstructed using weak gravitational lensing analysis , which all produced mass maps as the one shown in fig.([clowemass ] ) .",
    "they are listed in table [ tabwl ] ( i excluded nearby clusters and reconstruction from depletion by magnification bias ) .",
    "this table reveal some general trends .",
    "the averaged mass - to - light ratios from weak lensing ( @xmath26 ) is @xmath27 and typical velocity dispersion of those clusters is 1000 km / sec . when scaled with respect to the critical mass - to - light ratio ,",

    ", width=340 ]        in contrast , the mass density profiles are still too noisy to provide robust parameter profiles , like its central value , its typical scale and its slope .",
    "isothermal , power law or nfw `` universal '' models fit equally well the data ( see fig.([mas1008radialmass ] ) ) , for all clusters analyzed so far ( see ) .",
    "it is therefore not yet possible to test current numerical cdm predictions using this method .",
    "in fact , in view of the present signal - to - noise ratio of mass maps and the large family of possible analytical mass profiles , we are still far from being able to address in details this issue , if one use only weak distortion analysis .",
    ".results obtained from weak lensing analyses of clusters .",
    "the scale is the typical radial distance with respect to the cluster center .",
    "the ( m / l)@xmath31 ratio has been rescaled since most data where obtained with different filters ( this is a rough rescaling ; it probably increases uncertainties ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     figure [ sheartop ] show that they are all in very good agreement .",
    "this is a convincing demonstration that the correlation of ellipticities do not only results from unexpected systematic effects .",
    "the cosmological origin of the coherent distortion signal detected by all these surveys has been confirmed by decomposing the distortion field into e- and b- modes .",
    "the e - mode is a gradient term which contains signal produced by gravity - induced distortion .",
    "the b - mode is a pure curl - component , so it only contains intrinsic ellipticity correlation or systematics residuals .",
    "both modes have been extracted using the aperture mass statistics by van waerbeke et al ( , )  and pen et al ( ) , in the virmos - descart survey , as well as by hoekstra et al ( ) in the red cluster sequence survey . in both samples ,",
    "the e - mode dominates the signal , which strongly supports the gravitational origin of the distortion .",
    "+        the comparison of the top - hat shear variance with some realistic cosmological models has been done for these surveys . although some cosmological models are ruled by these data , as expected from eq.([eqvar ] ) the degeneracy between @xmath32 and @xmath33 hampers a strong discrimination among most popular cosmological models .",
    "the present - day constraints resulting from these studies , including the vlt and keck samples ( see figure([cosmovlt ] ) ) , can be summarized as follows ( 90% confidence level ) : @xmath34 and , in the case of a flat - universe with @xmath35 , we infer @xmath36 ( 68% c.l . ) . +     constrains obtained with the 50 vlt fields ( left ) by ( ) and with the 170 keck fields ( right ) by (; courtesy d. bacon ) .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=253 ]      higher order statistics , like the skewness of the convergence , @xmath37 , can also be computed .",
    "these statistics are sensitive to non gaussian features in the projected mass density field produced by non - linear systems like massive clusters or compact groups of galaxies ( , ) . as for the simple fiducial models discussed in the previous section",
    ", one can express also @xmath37 : @xmath38 therefore , in principle the degeneracy between @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be broken when both the variance and the skewness of the convergence are measured .",
    "+ unfortunately , the measurements of @xmath37 is presently hampered by a number a practical difficulties which are not yet fixed .",
    "in particular , the masking process which masks bright stars and defects on ccd images degrades the quality of the mass reconstruction . the reliability of its skewness as well as its cosmological interpretation are therefore seriously questioned .",
    "bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier ( ) have proposed an alternative method using some specific patterns in the shear three - point function .",
    "their detection strategy based on their method has been tested on ray tracing simulations and turns out to be robust , usable in patchy catalogs , and quite insensitive to the topology of the survey .",
    "they have recently used the analysis of the 3-point correlations function on the virmos - descart data .",
    "their results show a 2.4@xmath39 signal over four independent angular bins corresponding to angular scales between @xmath40 and @xmath41 arc - minutes .",
    "the amplitude and the shape of the signal are consistent with theoretical expectations obtained from ray - tracing simulations .",
    "this result supports the idea that the measure corresponds to a cosmological signal due to the gravitational instability dynamics .",
    "although the errors are still large to permit secure conclusions , one clearly sees that the amplitude and the shape of the 3-point correlations function match the most likely cosmological models .",
    "remarkably , the @xmath42cdm scenario perfectly fit the data points .",
    "+ the bernardeau et al ( ) result is the first detection of non - gaussian features in a cosmic shear survey and it opens the route to break the @xmath43 degeneracy . however , there are still some caveats which may be considered seriously .",
    "one difficulty is the source - lens clustering which could significantly perturb high - order statistics ( hamana et al 2002 ( ) ) .",
    "fig.([hamana ] ) shows that source clustering may change the amplitude of the skewness of the convergence by 20% .",
    "if so , multi - lens plane cosmic shear analysis will be necessary which implies a good knowledge of the redshift distribution . according to hamama et al ( fig .",
    "[ hamana ] ) , the source clustering contamination decreases with source redshift , so that this issue is less critical when lensed galaxies are a very high-@xmath44 . for sources at redshift one ,",
    "the effect of source clustering can drop down to less than 5% if the sources are within a narrow range in redshift .",
    "it implies that source redshift must be measured with an accuracy better than @xmath45 at redshift one , and better than 0.05 for source at redshift 0.5 .",
    "when looking at the bolzonnela et al plot on photo-@xmath44 ( see ) , this accuracy demands both optical and near infrared photometric data , with a photometric precision of about 10% in all filters .     and",
    "@xmath46 band data are obtained for most lensed galaxies , with a photometric accuracy of about 10% in each filter .",
    "( from ) , title=\"fig:\",width=328 ]   and @xmath46 band data are obtained for most lensed galaxies , with a photometric accuracy of about 10% in each filter . ( from ) , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]      although there are still a lot of technical issues that must be addressed prior to go toward high precision cosmology with cosmic shear , there are some immediate points which turn out to be important for the near future and where vlts can help . as for clusters ,",
    "let us present them by the following questions :    * what is the redshift distribution of sources ?",
    "* can be have an idea of source clustering for skewness ? *",
    "how can we minimize cosmic variance ? * how high order statistics are contaminated by @xmath47 and @xmath48 modes ?",
    "* are vlt competitive with respect to wide field 4-meter telescopes for cosmic shear ?",
    "these issues express the sensitivity of the variance and the skewness to source redshift , as shown in eq.([eqvar ] , [ eqs3 ] ) and to the source - lens clustering , as pointed out by ( ) . on the other hand , the strength of vlt with respect to other telescopes can also be discussed by looking at the signal - to - noise ratio of cosmic shear surveys . adopting the null hypothesis that no gravitational weak lensing signal is present , we can predict the expected limiting shear if only shot noise and sampling are taken into account ( in particular , we assume there is no systematic residual errors associated to image processing or psf corrections as those discussed later ) . for a @xmath49 shear variance limiting detection",
    "it writes : @xmath50^{-{1 \\over 4 } } \\times \\left[{\\sigma_{\\epsilon_{gal } } \\over 0.4 } \\right ] \\times   \\left[{n \\over 20 \\ gal / arcmin^2}\\right]^{-{1 \\over 2 } } \\times   \\left[{\\theta \\over 10'}\\right]^{{-{1 \\over 2 } } } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the total area covered by the survey , @xmath52 is the intrinsic ellipticity dispersion of galaxy and @xmath53 the galaxy number density of the survey .",
    "+ the sensitivity to @xmath51 favors ccd panoramic cameras on 4 meter telescopes against vlts with small field of view .",
    "however , the sensitivity to @xmath53 compensates this weak point . furthermore , since vlt are faster photon collectors than other ground based telescopes , they can observe much more uncorrelated fields , which can be spread over a very large sky area , which then lower the cosmic variance significantly .",
    "therefore , exactly as for clusters of galaxies , the need for vlt on cosmic shear projects is primarily the need for very accurate photometric redshifts and for very deep exposure to increase the galaxy number density .",
    "all conclusions relevant for clusters are therefore valid for cosmic shear . in addition",
    ", it is important to benefit from the speed of vlt to define an observing strategy based on a sparse sampling using a large number of fields rather than a very large total and compact field of view .",
    "the very large aperture of vlts make these telescopes the most competitive for all scientific goals which demand very deep or very fast capabilities . by increasing limiting magnitudes ,",
    "vlts permit to increase the galaxy number density of lensed galaxies , which in return drops the poisson noise , improves the spatial resolution of mass maps and increases the shear signal by increasing the redshift of sources . as we discussed in previous sections , the knowledge of redshift of sources as well as",
    "their clustering will be more and more critical in the future for high precision cosmology .",
    "both optical and near infrared capabilities will therefore be necessary .",
    "this requirement is hard to reconcile with high depth unless unrealistic amount of telescope time is spent on weak lensing and cosmic shear studies .",
    "indeed vlts are in this respect the best instruments , and a join fors1+isaac - like configuration looks promising for future surveys , provided the near infrared field of view is large enough . + the speed capabilities of vlts is almost of equal importance . as ( ) and",
    "( ) showed , 10 meter class telescopes can spend only 20 mn per field instead of one hour for 4 meter class telescopes .",
    "this advantage can be used to sample in a clever way the sky and make a sparse coverage of a huge field .",
    "maoli et al ( ) spread 50 6@xmath546 fors1 field overs 2000 deg@xmath55 and bacon et al ( ) spread 170 fields in the same way .",
    "clearly , one could envision to observe at least 1000 fields with vlt .",
    "figure ( [ nextsurvey ] ) show the gain when a survey is based on 100 , 150 or 300 fields ... one can see the potential to constrain cosmological models , with in addition accurate photometric redshift and therefore clustering informations for each field .",
    "this strategy can be also used to probe in a clever way the power spectrum on the projected mass density .",
    "however , there is not yet a clear quantitative evaluation of the optimum efficiency of such a survey as function of its topology and the sampling strategy .",
    "this point has to be clarified .",
    "+ the weakness of vlts is definitely the rather small field of view .",
    "subaru / suprime with of field of view of 24 turns out to be the most competitive configuration ( miyazaki 2002 , ( ) ) . for weak lensing studies of distant clusters of galaxies ,",
    "the field of view of is not a serious issue since 1 megaparsec roughly corresponds to 5 .",
    "therefore , vlt are definitely superior for weak lensing analysis of distant clusters of galaxies .",
    "in contrast , as eq.([survey ] ) shows , this may be a limitation for cosmic shear surveys .",
    "the incoming vmos camera on the vlt , which will have a 15 field of view will be a very competitive instrument for cosmic shear , provided it is demonstrated that is image quality is not degraded at the boundary of the field .",
    "the need for a wide field near infrared instrument with similar field of view as optical camera is clear .",
    "the @xmath46-band is not really necessary since even @xmath56 and @xmath57 bands are sufficient to get precise photometric redshifts .",
    "with such an optical+nir configuration , a cosmic shear survey covering at least 300 hundred uncorrelated fields with photo-@xmath44 for all galaxies will produce the most precise data set for high precision cosmology using gravitational lensing tools . +     confidence level .",
