    "in fact the virial theorem suggests that interior magnetic fields can reach the value of the order of @xmath3 @xmath2 .",
    "the influence of this extraordinary high magnetic field on neutron star matter properties are of particular importance after the discovery of magnetars @xcite .",
    "their observations suggest that in the case of these objects we are dealing with young neutron stars with extremely strong surface magnetic fields @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath2 which in turn give an interior field of the order of @xmath3 @xmath2 . also properties of proto - neutron stars , under the influence of magnetic field should be examined .",
    "assumptions concerning composition and the equation of state of hot , lepton rich matter have been studied by many authors ( strobel et al .",

    "matter inside a proto - neutron star is highly degenerate and chemical potentials of its constituents are a few hundreds of @xmath6 . like in a neutron star the strength of magnetic field of a proto - neutron star changes from @xmath7 @xmath2 at the surface up to @xmath3 @xmath2 in the center @xcite .",
    "a proto - neutron star @xcite is a result of a supernova explosion which forms low entropy core with trapped neutrinos .",
    "the core is surrounded by a low density , high entropy mantle .",
    "the construction of a proto - neutron star model is based on various realistic equations of state and gives a general picture of proto - neutron star interiors .",
    "the more complete and realistic description of a proto - neutron star requires taking into consideration effects of finite temperature and nonzero magnetic fields . using the relativistic mean - field theory approach the adequate form of the equation of state enlarged by contributions coming from magnetic field and temperature is constructed and serves as an input to the oppenheimer - volkoff - tolman equations .",
    "the theory considered here comprises electrons , neutrinos , scalar , vector - scalar and vector - isovector mesons .",
    "the rmf theory implies that the nucleon interactions appear through the exchange of meson fields @xcite .",
    "this theory is very useful in describing properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "its extrapolation to large charge asymmetry is of considerable interest in nuclear astrophysics and particulary in constructing proto - neutron and neutron star models where extreme conditions of isospin are realized .",
    "the model considered describes high isospin asymmetric matter and it has to be extended by the inclusion of isovector - scalar meson @xmath8 ( the @xmath0 meson ) and nonlinear vector meson interaction terms . knowing the form of the equation of state is the decisive factor in determining properties of proto - neutron stars such as : central density , mass - radius relation , crust extent or the moment of inertia .",
    "the essential goal of this paper is to obtain the equation of state for proto - neutron star matter within the described above model in the relativistic mean field approach ( rmf ) and to study the influence of proton fraction on proto - neutron stars parameters .",
    "the variable proton fraction together with the inclusion of @xmath0 meson and nonlinear vector meson interactions alter the proto - neutron stars chemical composition .",
    "this in turn affects the properties of the star making the proto - neutron star more compact .",
    "the lagrangian function for the system can be written as a sum of a baryonic part @xmath9 which includes baryon - meson interaction terms , mesonic part @xmath10 containing additional interactions between mesons which mathematically express themselves as supplementary , nonlinear terms in the lagrangian function , the leptonic part @xmath11 , the lagrangian density function of the qed theory @xmath12 and the gravitational term @xmath13 @xmath14 the final form of the lagrangian function is given by @xmath15 with the covariant derivatives @xmath16 and @xmath17 defined as @xmath18 in the case of nucleons @xmath19 takes the value @xmath20 for protons ( @xmath20 is the electron charge ) and @xmath21 for neutrons ( @xmath22 ) . in the leptonic sector ( @xmath23 ) where @xmath24 is given for electrons and muons and @xmath21 for neutrinos .",
    "@xmath25 is higgs field and this field has only the residual form @xmath26 where the value @xmath27 comes from the electroweak interaction scale . in a strong magnetic field , contributions coming from the anomalous magnetic moments of protons and neutrons ( @xmath28 ) have to be also considered .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moments introduced via the minimal coupling of nucleons to the electromagnetic field tensor can be represented phenomenologically by interactions of the type @xmath29 , where @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "considering both the physical conditions and chemical equilibrium which are likely to be satisfied in a proto - neutron star one can construct a proto - neutron star model with a temperature @xmath31 equals @xmath32 @xmath6 and magnetic field strength @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the value of the critical magnetic field for an electron @xmath34= @xmath35= @xmath36 @xmath2 .",
    "the model examined in this paper represents the one with moderate value of magnetic field . in this case the contributions to the equation of state coming from anomalous magnetic moments are small @xmath37 in comparison with the energy of magnetic field .",
    "thus this relatively small value of magnetic field allows to neglect the anomalous magnetic moments unlike to the case describe in the paper by prakash et al .",

    "the fermion fields which are included in this model consists of neutrons , protons , electrons , muons and neutrinos @xmath39 as a proto - neutron star matter is of sizeable asymmetry the additional @xmath40 meson has been included and the meson sector is composed of isoscalar ( scalar @xmath41 and vector @xmath42 ) and isovector ( scalar @xmath0 and vector @xmath43 ) mesons .",

    "the energy dispersion relation for protons for arbitrary landau level in a magnetic field is @xcite @xmath58 and @xmath59 being `` spin '' number . for moderate values of magnetic fields strength",
    "this equation reduces to the following one @xmath60 a neutron can interact with an external electromagnetic field by means of the pauli non - minimal coupling .",
    "then the energy dispersion relation for neutrons in a magnetic field is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the components of the neutron momentum parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field . as it is usually assumed in quantum hadrodynamics the mean field approximation is adopted and for the ground state of homogeneous infinite matter quantum fields operators are replaced by their classical expectation values .",
    "one can separate mesonic fields into classical mean field values and quantum fluctuations which are not included in the ground state and thus mesons fields are replaced by their mean values @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "the obtained effective nucleon chemical potentials allow to define conditions that are regarded as essential to uniquely determine the complete equilibrium composition of proto - neutron star matter at given density .",
    "these conditions arise from charge neutrality , baryon and lepton number conservation .",
    "the last one is strictly connected with the assumption that proto - neutron star matter is opaque to neutrinos .",
    "neutrinos are trapped inside the matter and this through the requirement of @xmath74 equilibrium puts certain limits on the chemical composition of a proto - neutron star matter . for",

    "@xmath77 from the equations ( [ mp ] ) and ( [ mn ] ) the electron neutrino chemical potential can be expressed in the following way @xmath78 with the assumption that only electron neutrinos are captured in the star core @xmath79 the following relations for electron neutrino and muon chemical potentials can be obtained @xmath80 both electron neutrino and muon chemical potentials depend on nucleon asymmetry .",
    "the muon chemical potential depends on the asymmetry of the whole system through the value of the @xmath81 meson field which is directly connected with the neutron excess and the difference of nucleon energies .",
    "comparison between the matter with high asymmetry @xmath82 and the one with low asymmetry indicates that in the former case the muon chemical potential is greater than that of the later one .",
    "this translates to the lower number of muons in the proto - neutron star matter with the proton number @xmath83 of the order of @xmath84 .",
    "the increase of neutron excess is connected with the increasing number of muons .",
    "their contribution to the pressure and energy density of the system become significant . to construct the equation of state of the system the energy - momentum tensor has to be calculated .",
    "the pressure is related to the statistical average of the trace of the spatial components of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath85 whereas the energy density @xmath86 equals @xmath87 . in general in the presence of magnetic field the pressure can be written as a sum of the isotropic part which includes contributions coming from electrons , nucleons , mesons and the electromagnetic anisotropic part @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 in cartesian coordinates the electromagnetic part of the energy momentum tensor in the flat space - time has the form @xmath90 on the other hand in polar coordinates @xmath88 has been written as follows @xmath91 taking the average over all directions allows to obtain the isotropic form of the energy momentum tensor relevant for the spherical symmetric configuration @xmath92 the assumption of the positivity of the total pressure @xmath93 has been made .",
    "any negative contributions to the pressure diminish it and lead to the decrease of a star radius .",
    "the described above averaging approximates the star as an spherically symmetric object with the radius @xmath94 which is smaller than the equatorial radius of an anisotropic star .",
    "( the case of an anisotropic star is calculated in details in the paper by konno et al .",
    "the condition of the positivity of the total pressure establishes a limiting value of the density noted as @xmath95 and at the same time puts limit on the spherical symmetric approximation ( the deformation of the star is neglected ) . for densities smaller than the critical one the total pressure became negative and",
    "there is no gravity compensation in this direction .",

    "analyzing properties of proto - neutron star matter some features which are relevant for proto - neutron stars have to be considered .",
    "it is a necessary assumption that the matter is opaque to neutrinos . as a result neutrinos",
    "are trapped dynamically inside the matter on the diffusion time scale and in contradiction to neutron star matter the total lepton number @xmath110 is kept constant .",
    "theoretical predictions determine the value of @xmath111 at the onset of trapping at about 0.35 - 0.4 . since a proto - neutron star is formed during a supernova explosion it is safely to make an assumption about finite temperature in the interior of a star .",
    "this is limited by the requirement of constant value of entropy in a proto - neutron star core . in this paper",
    "the temperature is fixed and equals 20 mev .",
    "thus conditions which have to be considered namely : finite temperature , lepton number conservation , @xmath74- equilibrium , charge neutrality and additionally nonzero magnetic field allow to construct a realistic proto - neutron star model . all of these mentioned above conditions influence medium properties such as nucleon effective masses , density and proton - neutron asymmetry and in consequence constrain the nucleon and lepton species inside the star core .",
    "the proton fraction @xmath112 which is determined by @xmath74 equilibrium , for matter transparent to neutrinos ( neutron star matter ) takes the value of the order of @xmath113 whereas when neutrinos do contribute they displace the equilibrium proton fraction to the higher value @xmath114 . for the purpose of comparison",
    "all calculations have been performed for decreasing value of proton fractions @xmath115 , respectively .",

    "they have been examined for moderate strength of magnetic field .",
    "if the proton fraction equals @xmath117 ( the proto - neutron star matter ) electron and neutrino electron chemical potentials are increasing functions of a density .",
    "neutrinos are trapped inside the matter and their chemical potential differs from zero ( see relation [ poten ] ) . for the proton fraction",

    "this picture shows the profile of neutrino chemical potential in the core of the star for the chosen values of @xmath83 and for chosen parameter set ( tm1+nonl . ) . for the star with the value of asymmetry typical for a proto - neutron star matter @xmath119 muons are of insignificant meaning",
    "however , they become much more important for lower value of proton number .",
    "the asymmetry entered into calculations at different levels starting from the displacement of proton and neutron chemical potentials @xmath120 . in a model with @xmath40 meson exchange",

    "there are also contributions coming from nonlinear vector meson interactions .",
    "the nuclear asymmetry diminishes the neutrino chemical potential and thus lowers neutrino density .",
    "the influence of the asymmetry is most distinctive in the high density region inside a proto - neutron star .",
    "the forms of neutrino profiles in the proto - neutron star core depend on the asymmetry of the whole system .",
    "the behavior of chemical potentials translates to the forms of the equation of state and successively to the mass - radius relations .",
    "results are obtained for two particular cases namely for the nonmagnetic one ( @xmath122 ) and for the value of magnetic field @xmath123 .",
    "the presence of magnetic field makes the equation of state stiffer ( fig .",
    "2 ) , whereas for more asymmetric matter the obtained equation of state is softer .",
    "dots represent the limit of making the approximation of spherically symmetric star in the presence of magnetic field . for more asymmetric matter",
    "the dot is shifted towards higher densities . in fig . 3 one can compare the influence of changing proton fraction on star parameters .",
    "the obtained sequences of mass - radius for nonmagnetic and magnetic proto - neutron stars show that the increasing asymmetry diminishes proto - neutron star radii causing that the star parameters start to resemble that of neutron stars .",
    "this effect is even stronger in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "there are relatively minor changes in the value of maximal masses caused by the variation of proton fraction .",
    "however , there is a tendency of the increase of the maximal mass for growing asymmetry .",
    "the star parameters are also sensitive to the presence of nonlinear vector meson interaction terms in the lagrangian function ( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "this is clearly visible in fig .",
    "4 . comparison of results obtained for original gm3 and tm1 equations of state ( for neutron stars ) with that obtained for tm1+nonl .",
    "shows that the last one gives the configuration with the bigger value of maximal mass . in the range of lower densities the tm1+nonl .",
