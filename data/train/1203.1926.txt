    "is its subsequent evolution , the potential formation of a , and the powering of a supernova ( sn ) explosion , sometimes associated with a long - duration  burst ( lgrb ) .",
    "the situation is deceptively simple and the outcome rests fundamentally on the solution to an energy problem .",
    "an explosion or a fizzle depends on the efficiency with which the system can extract the prodigious gravitational energy released during collapse .",
    "there are two principal forms of energy at disposal .",
    "the first one is the gravitational - binding energy liberated by the collapsing star and in particular its degenerate core .",
    "the second is its rotational energy ( actually drawn from gravitational energy ) , which is a function of the angular - momentum distribution and budget in the progenitor star . understanding how these two energy sources can be channeled to power relativistic and non - relativistic ejecta in core - collapse sne and",
    "leave behind a neutron star , a fast - rotating pulsar , a magnetar , or a black hole , has been the subject of numerous studies and the source of much debate @xcite .    thermal mev neutrinos are abundantly radiated from the optically - thick , dense , and hot , allowing its internal energy to be released on a diffusion timescale . in the neutrino mechanism for core - collapse sn explosions @xcite , the absorption in the infalling mantle of @xmath010% of this neutrino flux may alone lead to the revival of the stalled shock and the ejection of the progenitor envelope with an asymptotic kinetic energy of up to 1b ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "but this generic mechanism should not , however , be the origin of the larger explosion energies of @xmath010b inferred for a small fraction of core - collapse sne . instead , their scarcity calls for exceptional circumstances , which seem intricately related to fast progenitor - core rotation @xcite .",
    "it is probable that most stars contain some angular momentum at the time of death , either because they did not lose it completely through the combined effects of magnetic torques and stellar - wind mass loss @xcite , or because they gained it from a companion star in a binary system @xcite . as the envelope collapses , the rotational energy increases .",
    "during this process , the inner core ( @xmath2 ) spins up by about three orders of magnitude and remains in solid body rotation , while the outer core develops a differentially - rotating profile @xcite .",
    "the energy associated with rotation can be large ( @xmath3 ) and tapped by instabilities developing at the surface of the , in particular the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations for fast - rotating progenitor stars suggest that the magneto - rotational mechanism of explosion is promising and offers a very attractive explanation for the existence of highly - energetic sne @xcite .",
    "however , this mechanism relies fundamentally on the assumption that the mri can increase the magnetic field to the required values .",
    "an assumption that has not yet been shown numerically in the full core - collapse context , although preliminary investigations in this sector are promising @xcite . hence , combined with the diversity of progenitor - core properties , these two mechanisms alone",
    ", the neutrino and the magneto - rotational mechanism , may explain the diversity of core - collapse sne , potentially encompassing two orders of magnitude in explosion energy , from the low - luminosity sne ii - plateau @xcite to highly energetic sne ic @xcite .",
    "a great puzzle is then to understand the necessary departures from this general core collapse scenario to produce an lgrb in addition to a sn explosion , as spectroscopically confirmed in , to date , six lgrb / sne pairs , ( for a recent compilation , see @xcite ) .",
    "this requires that @xmath00.1 - 1b be injected into a low - mass , baryon - deficient collimated region ( at the origin of ) and that at the same time @xmath010b be injected quasi - isotropically to eject the progenitor envelope ( at the origin of the sn thermal emission observed in the optical ) .",
    "the very low occurrence rate of lgrb / sn per core - collapse sn of @xmath41% @xcite calls for progenitor properties that are rarely encountered in star formation / evolution .",
    "interestingly , an unambiguous diversity emerges among lgrb / sn observations , necessarily translating into a significant range for the inferred properties of the sn ejecta , with proposed masses and kinetic energies possibly varying by a factor of 510 for both @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a significant uncertainty is associated with such inferences .",
    "for example , @xcite propose an ejecta mass of 11  with a total energy of 2050b for grb980425/sn1998bw , but @xcite reproduce the light curve with an ejecta of @xmath05  and a total energy of 22b .",
    "such differences are not surprising since both spectra and light curves must be modeled simultaneously and with allowance for the complicated non - lte non - thermal and time - dependent effects controlling the radiative transfer .",
    "the exceptionally fast ejecta expansion of hypernovae is expected to strengthen the time - dependent effects seen in  standard \" core - collapse sne @xcite while the large production of  and significant mixing may sizably affect line - profile shapes from which the expansion rate is inferred @xcite .",
    "two lgrb central - engine models are currently favored .",
    "they suggest the key components for a successful lgrb / sn are a compact progenitor with a short light - crossing time of @xmath01s and fast rotation at the time of collapse .",
    "one is the collapsar model @xcite : a fast - rotating progenitor fails to explode in its early post - bounce phase and instead forms a black hole , while the in - falling envelope eventually forms a keplerian disk feeding the hole on an accretion / viscous timescale comparable to that of the lgrb .",
    "it is within this disk that the sn explosion is triggered and the  synthesized .",
    "the other model involves a proto - magnetar @xcite in which the lgrb is born after a successful sn explosion ( either by the neutrino or the magneto - rotational mechanism , although the latter seems more likely given the rapid rotation required for the magnetar ) and the ejection of the overlying envelope ( or at least the onset of the ejection of the inner envelope layers that clear the  surface ) .",
    "fast rotation in the  permits the huge enhancement of the magnetic - field energy and stresses , which strengthen as the  cools and contracts , eventually giving rise to relativistic ejecta ( @xmath010s after the onset of collapse , once the neutrino driven wind decays away ) . in both models , rotation is key to control the dynamics in a unique way .",
    "it is also key to allow the simultaneous ejection of baryon - deficient material at relativistic speeds over a small solid angle and the quasi - spherical ejection of the progenitor envelope .",
    "a critical difference between the collapsar model and the proto - magnetar model is that the collapsar has to form a black hole .",
    "being so central to the model , it is legitimate to investigate what conditions black - hole formation in this context @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , little has been done on this problem .",
    "numerous simulations so far have focused on the early collapse phase and the revival of the sn shock , stopping too early to make any statement concerning black - hole formation . in 1d",
    ", several studies have investigated the neutrino signal and progenitor dependence of non - rotating failed sne @xcite . @xcite",
    "have performed 2d simulations of black - hole formation and the subsequent formation of an accretion disk , although with initial conditions that are incommensurate with currently suggested lgrb progenitors . in 3d",
    ", @xcite performed fully general - relativistic simulations of black - hole formation , however using a simplified soft equation of state that favored it .",
    "finally , other simulations have started from a pre - existing  and investigated the powering of the jet at the origin of the lgrb @xcite , or the longer - term synthesis of  in this unusual context @xcite .",
    "no simulation has ever demonstrated from first principles , and thus convincingly , the validity of the collapsar model , i.e. , that the progenitors proposed for this model would indeed proceed through each and every necessary step : collapse , formation of a , failure of the shock revival , formation of a  followed by that of a keplerian disk , and finally the powering of both the lgrb and the sn , including the synthesis of a generally large amount of  by core - collapse sn standards .",
    "this is an obvious shortcoming of all theoretical investigations on the collapsar model and its proposed progenitors .",
    "similar gaps in the modeling of proto - magnetar driven lgrbs exist : the early magneto - rotational core - collapse sn evolution has been modeled in 2d @xcite and so has the phase in which relativistic outflows are driven @xcite , but the evolution connecting the two phases has not been modeled .",
    "the robustness of the magneto - rotational explosion mechanism largely rests on the efficiency of angular - momentum transport , and in particular the extraction of the free - energy stored ( and replenished through accretion ) in differential rotation at the surface of the proto - neutron star .",
    "the failure to extract this energy on short time scales may , however , facilitate black - hole formation , although it may also compromise energy extraction in the collapsar model .",
    "these complicated issues require detailed modeling to build upon the promising results of @xcite and @xcite . to this day",
    ", the collapsar model has been studied more extensively than the proto - magnetar model for lgrbs , so the later may look more promising in some ways in part because of the lesser scrutiny it has received .    in this paper , we focus on one important aspect of the collapsar model to validate , or invalidate , the assumption , often made but so far never checked , that the lgrb progenitor models available in the literature indeed collapse to form a .",
    "we do this by performing hydrodynamical simulations of the lgrb progenitor models of @xcite using the code ` gr1d ` @xcite .",
    "this issue is critical for testing the potential of progenitor stars for producing lgrbs via the collapsar mechanism , but may also serve to diagnose an attractive channel for the formation of proto - magnetars .",
    "such `` failed '' collapsars ( because they explode before forming a ) represent a serious alternative for the production of lgrbs , although they have their own caveats @xcite .",
    "admittedly , the phenomenon of core collapse , bounce , and the events that follow are fundamentally multi - d .",
    "we believe , however , that much can be learned from 1d simulations of the kind presented here .",
    "for example , the mass - accretion rate onto the  is largely determined by the angular - averaged density profile of the progenitor star , which we capture accurately .",
    "our 1d exploration reveals the landscape of core properties at bounce and quantifies fundamental differences between progenitors . in the next section ,",
    "we start by reviewing results from stellar - evolution models for lgrb progenitors .",
    "we then describe our methodology for the ` gr1d ` simulations of lgrb progenitors available in the literature .",
    "we make a short digression in section  [ sect : rot ] to discuss the rotational properties of the collapsed cores of massive stars . in section  [ sect_results ]",
    ", we present our results before concluding in section  [ sect_conc ] .",
    "stellar - evolution calculations have been performed to investigate the mass , rotation , and metallicity requirements for producing fast - rotating pre - collapse stars .",
    "both single- @xcite and binary - star @xcite evolutionary scenarios have been investigated .",
    "fast rotation of the proto - stellar core is clearly critical to procure a large angular momentum to the star initially .",
    "if the rotation rate attained is sufficiently large , the star may even evolve chemically homogeneously and avoid a supergiant phase , which is known to sap the core of its rotation through the effects of magnetic torques .",
    "such fast - rotating chemically - homogeneous stars also naturally die as h - deficient he - poor wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "low metallicity quenches the stellar - wind mass loss rate , a condition that may be more important for a single - star scenario than for the binary - star scenario @xcite .",
    "while the general outcome of these simulations is that it is possible to produce massive stars with a rapidly spinning core / envelope at death , it is difficult to compare the final properties of published models .",
    "indeed , models are rarely evolved all the way to an iron core .",
    "the treatments of mixing , mass loss , and angular - momentum loss / transport differ .",
    "magnetic - fields may or may not be included and when they are the prescription may differ @xcite .    furthermore , all these studies remain speculative about the outcome of collapse for such progenitors .",
    "they argue for black hole formation and the formation of a disk based on order of magnitude estimates , rather than detailed numerical simulations . for a start , of all the lgrb progenitor simulations ,",
    "only those of @xcite are evolved all the way to the onset of collapse . in simulations",
    "halted well before , the iron - core mass is estimated from the co - core mass @xcite or is simply not considered in the discussion @xcite .",
    "most studies consider a model viable for producing a collapsar based exclusively on the angular - momentum budget of the inner 3 , and perform no checks on the likelihood of forming a : its formation is deemed so obvious that the discussion of any alternate scenario is generally omitted .",
    "differing in their criteria and approaches for selecting collapsar candidates , some studies may yield progenitor - mass ranges that do not even overlap : using an angular - momentum criterion , @xcite favor progenitor stars with a main - sequence mass below @xmath030 .",
    "in contrast , @xcite , arguing for the need for both a large angular momentum , a large iron core , and a wo stellar type at death , favor progenitors with a main - sequence masses above @xmath035(magnetic fields are not treated in this work , though ) .",
    "recent studies suggest that selecting collapsar progenitors based exclusively on a large angular - momentum budget may be too simplistic .",
    "for example , the magneto - rotational explosion invoked to explain hypernovae derives its energy from this same large core angular momentum ( via the mri and the strongly differentially - rotating layers in the post - shock region ) .",
    "this mechanism does not obviously accommodate the formation of a , as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "they simulated the collapse of the core and the development of a magneto - rotational explosion in model 35oc of @xcite and found that rotational energy of order 10b is readily available to launch a sn ejecta on a timescale of a few 100ms .",
    "they furthermore found that accretion is easily shut off by the developing explosion and that the  mass fails to grow to the instability threshold for black - hole formation .",
    "however , the simulations of @xcite did not resolve the mri but instead used an equipartition ansatz to estimate the magnitude of the mri - amplified magnetic fields .",
    "in reality , magnetic - field reconnection may , for example , compromise the dynamical potential of magnetic stresses , channeling magnetic energy into heat to be radiated away by neutrinos .",
    "this and other alternatives have been studied by @xcite under the general form of viscous dissipation .",
    "they find that the extra energy deposition can , in some cases , considerably alter the post - bounce dynamics and generate a vigorous explosion .",
    "@xcite studied black - hole formation based on a variety of progenitor models characterized by different main - sequence mass , metallicity , and rotation rate .",
    "they find that the outcome of collapse can be anticipated from the bounce compactness of the progenitor core structure and in particular that of the region inside 2.5 , which corresponds approximately to the maximum mass that a  can have and remain in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "they find that higher mass progenitors published in the literature do not always have larger iron cores and therefore that they are not necessarily more prone to black - hole formation .",
    "they also reveal considerable diversity in progenitor core structure , even for the same main - sequence mass .",
    "some stellar evolution studies obtain a monotonic increase of the iron - core mass ( or bounce compactness ; see fig .",
    "9 of @xcite ) versus main - sequence mass ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , while some show an anti - correlation beyond @xmath040  @xcite .",
    "the primary reason for this are differing prescriptions for rate and time of mass loss , one of the major uncertainties in massive star evolution ( see also the discussions in @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "as advocated by @xcite , the bounce compactness is a robust quantity for diagnosing the propensity to black - hole formation , which is largely determined by the spatial extent encompassed by the 2.5  lagrangian mass coordinate at core bounce in the progenitor core . to avoid introducing biases associated with the non - uniform conditions in the progenitor simulations ( ` kepler ` models are not all evolved to the same central density on their collapse trajectory ) this compactness is unambiguously evaluated at the time of bounce .",

    "our simulations first demonstrate that most of the models have a small core compactness @xmath61 .",
    "@xcite argues that a compactness of 0.45 represents a threshold value , for the neutrino mechanism , since above it an unrealistic neutrino - heating efficiency is required to prevent black - hole formation .",

    "therefore we suggest caution when attempting to interpret the outcome of a model based solely on the bounce compactness , since the adopted threshold value for bh formation is a semi - quantitative estimate based on where the slope of the required heating efficiency begins to clearly increase ( see the discussion in @xcite ) . when plotting the critical heating efficiency of the non - rotating solar metallicity stars from @xcite determined in @xcite , together with the generally fast - rotating progenitors of @xcite , we find that both datasets in fact overlap for the most part ( fig .",

    "we note that this result is not so surprising given the small iron - core mass ( @xmath62 ) of most @xcite models ( see their tables  1 and 2 ) .",
    "the first conclusion from our work is therefore that most of the models presented here are rather unlikely to form a black hole and thus may fail in a very fundamental way to produce a collapsar , irrespective of their angular - momentum budget .     versus bounce compactness @xmath61 for our ` gr1d ` simulations of the @xcite models , whose properties",

    "only models with the fastest rotation rates achieve a larger compactness in excess of 0.40.5 , but these may then be diverted from black - hole formation through an early magneto - rotational explosion .",
    "[ fig : eta_xi ] ]    within each sequence presented in table  [ tab : results ] , the models that form a  within 3.5s of core bounce , and thus at least in principle susceptible to form a collapsar , are the faster rotating ones characterized by very weak mass - loss rates .",
    "these properties conspire to produce larger co cores , more typical of more massive stars that do not rotate . in the following discussion , we group these models into several categories .",
    "the first category are models which obviously do not give rise to a lgrb , either by the standard type - i collapsar or the proto - magnetar mechanism , because they contain too little angular momentum . optimistically assuming a failed core - collapse sn , which is unlikely given the modest values of @xmath61 , models 12sg ( @xmath63 ) , 16og ( @xmath64 ) , 16si ( @xmath65 ) , and 16tg ( @xmath66 ) possess too little angular momentum in the remainder of the star to form a disk about the central black hole within @xmath67s of collapse .",

    "we find that these progenitors are at odds with the proposed criteria for a collapsar progenitor or with the inferred properties of observed lgrb / sne , namely a h - deficient he - poor wr star with a massive iron core ( equivalent to a large compactness ) , a large angular momentum to form a keplerian disk soon after black - hole formation , an ejecta of @xmath010 , and an evolution at about 0.1 solar metallicity .",
    "a critical aspect that we focus on in this study is the compactness of the progenitor cores at bounce , a quantity that helps diagnose the likelihood of black - hole formation .",
    "we group the @xcite models in different categories according to their suitability for producing collapsars :    1 .",
    "models with a dimensionless kerr spin parameter greater than unity at an enclosed mass of 3 , i.e. the models identified by @xcite as having the best potential for collapsar formation , fail to collapse when evolved with ` gr1d ` .",
    "their cores are so fast spinning that the associated centrifugal acceleration leads them into expansion .",
    "all these models are evolved until death in ` kepler ` without magnetic fields and centrifugal forces , which seems questionable given the unrealistically short spin periods at collapse .",
    "models evolved with magnetic fields produce much lower rotation rates and most collapse with ` gr1d ` .",
    "3 .   of those evolved with magnetic fields , models with moderate rotation produce progenitors with a small compactness comparable to that characterizing the low - mass massive - star models proposed as progenitors of garden - variety core - collapse sne . a small fraction of these is endowed with sufficient angular momentum to make a proto - magnetar , and thus a potential channel for producing lgrbs .",
    "a few models ( 12tj , 16sn ) with the fastest rotation possess a large compactness favorable for black - hole formation and sufficient angular momentum for the formation of a keplerian disk , but they require evolution at metallicities in the range 0.0001 - 0.01z@xmath96 , significantly lower than the metallicity of a few tenths solar or even higher at which these lgrb / sne are found @xcite .",
    "although in many respects very attractive for forming a collapsar ( if we ignore its huge core angular momentum ) , model 35oc is characterized by a large envelope mass of @xmath023 , which is a factor 2 - 10 times larger than the inferred ejecta mass of lgrb / sne discovered so far ( for a summary , see @xcite ) . we note that these models have a large angular momentum in the core , as models in the previous category , and may thus experience a magneto - rotational explosion preventing collapsar formation .",
    "our quantitative study thus spells out the various shortcomings of these progenitor stars for producing collapsars . even in those models that have the right compactness for black - hole formation and sufficient angular momentum for disk formation , it is still unresolved today how they would avoid the magneto - rotational mechanism of explosion that is used to explain hypernovae @xcite the difficulty of forming a  and avoiding a magneto - rotational explosion in fast - rotating cores , at least in the models of @xcite , lends credence to the proto - magnetar model of lgrb / sne .",
    "uncertainties in mass loss at low metallicity , and in particular during transient phases of dynamical mass loss as observed in some luminous blue variable stars , is an issue , since it may completely dominate the mass lost in the form of a weaker , but secular , steady - state wind @xcite .",
    "this uncertain mass - loss rate plagues more severely the evolution of higher - mass stars , since 15 - 20  stars stay further away from the eddington limit , and overall lose little mass , even at solar metallicity . by what mechanism ,",
    "at what rate , and during what phases a 100  star loses mass ( and angular momentum ) is much less well known and this directly conditions the final mass and iron core mass at collapse .",
    "overall , this suggests that studies of collapsar progenitors would benefit from a second look .",
    "angular momentum is key in the current collapsar and proto - magnetar models , but there is a stiff requirement on the progenitor compactness to speculate on its propensity for forming a , and thus for producing a lgrb through one or the other channel .",
    "a major step forward in resolving those issues would be to conduct massive - star evolution with rotation , centrifugal force , and magnetic fields always all the way to the formation of a degenerate neutronized core on the verge of collapse .",
    "this would allow a straightforward comparison of results between groups , and an easy determination of the compactness using ` gr1d ` to test the suitability of the core for black - hole formation .",
    "the ultimate check on the collapsar model requires multi - dimensional simulations covering the whole evolution from progenitor collapse , bounce , failed explosion during the  phase , formation of a  followed by the formation of a keplerian disk , and the powering of a @xmath010b sn ejecta . as we emphasize , black - hole formation is perhaps one of the most difficult steps in this sequence of events , and in that respect , renders the proto - magnetar channel quite attractive for the production of hypernovae and lgrbs .",
    "the diversity of lgrb / sne , the existence of sn - less lgrbs and of lgrb - less hypernovae , may in fact call for a variety of formation channels for these rare events , including both collapsars and proto - magnetars .",
