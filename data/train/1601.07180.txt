    "thanks to the launch of the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope in june 2008 , we now have access to @xmath97 years of @xmath0-ray data from both galactic and extragalactic sources .",
    "more than half of the @xmath0-ray sources detected by the large area telescope ( lat ) on - board the _ fermi _ satellite are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , with @xmath998% of these agn a subclass known as blazars @xcite .",
    "blazars are oriented closely towards our line of sight , and can be further split into two subclasses - bl lacertae ( bl lac ) objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) @xcite .",
    "the effect of this direct orientation is that the emission we see from blazars is highly doppler boosted , causing blazars to appear as some of the brightest objects in the @xmath0-ray sky , particularly during flaring episodes @xcite .    despite the volume of @xmath0-ray data that we are able to collect from both the _ fermi_-lat and ground - based instruments , we are unable to resolve the emission spatially .",
    "the process of locating the emission region is therefore indirect , and many different methods have previously been employed .",
    "the origin of the @xmath0-ray emission from blazars has traditionally been assumed to be close to the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "this conclusion is based in part on the results of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) modelling ( e.g. @xcite ) , as well as the compact size of the emission region inferred from observations of rapid @xmath0-ray variability @xcite . using the size of the emission region to infer its location rests on the assumption of a constant jet geometry , where the size of the emission region , @xmath10 , is related to the distance from the smbh , @xmath11 , and constant opening angle , @xmath12 , by @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "there are , however , studies that have concluded a molecular torus ( mt ) or parsec - scale origin for the @xmath0-ray emission from blazars @xcite",
    ". multi - wavelength ( mwl ) studies of blazars have resolved outbursts in radio emission on a parsec - scale from the smbh , and simultaneous flares in the @xmath0-ray regime suggest a common origin for the @xmath0-ray emission @xcite .",
    "the presence of significant very high energy ( vhe ) emission from blazars also supports the idea that the emission region is not located within the broad - line region ( blr ) @xcite .",
    "the possibility of multiple emission regions has recently been suggested , based on @xmath0-ray observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the fsrq 3c  454.3 has been extraordinarily bright over the past decade . in december 2009 ,",
    "3c  454.3 reached a record high energy @xmath0-ray flux level for blazars , with a daily flux ( @xmath14  mev ) of @xmath15  ph  @xmath16  s@xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18  ph  @xmath16  s@xmath17 @xcite observed by _",

    "@xcite respectively .",
    "it flared spectacularly again in november 2010 , becoming brighter than even the galactic vela pulsar . the daily flux measured for this flare peaked at @xmath19  ph  @xmath16  s@xmath17 @xcite , with a flux of @xmath20  ph  @xmath16  s@xmath17 detected on a timescale of @xmath912  h @xcite .",
    "the analysis in 3 hour time bins revealed that the flux reached @xmath21  ph  @xmath16  s@xmath17 on modified julian date ( mjd ) 55520 @xcite .",
    "these high flux levels have enabled extensive analysis to be done on the @xmath0-ray characteristics of 3c  454.3 , and the @xmath0-ray emission has been suggested to originate both from the blr and on parsec - scale distances from the smbh ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "method ] , we describe the method for data preparation and _ fermi_-lat data analysis routines . in section [ sec : taus ] we present our findings in relation to the @xmath0-ray flux variability timescales , and in section [ sec : specvar ] we explore the spectral shape during the flare period .",
    "this includes both the variation in the shape of the spectrum and an analysis of the high energy emission . in section [ sec : hardness ] we investigate whether or not an energy - dependence of the cooling of the emitting electron population exists , and we discuss the interpretation of the combined results in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we summarise our conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the data used in this study were collected by the _ fermi_-lat ( hereafter _ fermi _ ) .",
    "we consider photons detected in the energy range 0.1  @xmath1  300  gev , between mission elapse time ( met ) 422409603 and 427248003 .",
    "this corresponds to midnight on the 22nd may 2014 until midnight on 17th july 2014 .",
    "the enhanced @xmath0-ray emission from 3c  454.3 during this period was reported by @xcite as the first flare was peaking , on 15th june 2014 .",
    "for this reason , the flaring period is referred to as june 2014 in this paper .",
    "the region of interest ( roi ) covers a radius of 15@xmath22 centred on 3c  454.3 .",
    "a radius of 15@xmath22 was chosen to account for the point spread function ( psf ) of the detected @xmath0-rays .",
    "the psf of a photon depends on the energy of the photon , due to differences in the photon scattering .",
    "the 68% containment angle for @xmath0-rays ranges from @xmath96@xmath22 for 0.1  gev photons to @xmath90.2@xmath22 for 100  gev photons @xcite .",

    "the spectra of point sources in the region of interest are often modelled as power laws .",
    "the log parabola spectral shape of 3c  454.3 , as well as of other blazars modelled in the roi , is defined as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of photons  @xmath16  s@xmath17  mev@xmath17 , @xmath26 is the normalisation of the energy spectrum , @xmath27 is the @xmath0-ray photon energy and @xmath28 is the scaling factor of the energy spectrum .",

    "the minuit minimiser was used during all _ fermi _ gtlike optimisations . during this binned analysis ,",
    "the spectral parameters of all of the sources in the roi were free to vary .",
    "this ensured that the spectral parameters returned for each source provided an accurate representation of the spectral state of the source during the time period studied here .    from the results of the binned analysis",
    ", we compared the observed @xmath0-ray counts map with the model counts map of the roi , created by the _ fermi _",
    "gtmodel tool .",
    "this was done in order to assess whether or not any significant @xmath0-ray sources existed in the roi that had not been included in the 2fgl catalog .",
    "a residuals map was created by subtracting the model counts map from the observational counts map , and dividing by the model counts map .",
    "the observed map , model map and residuals map are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmaps ] .",
    "if any significant sources were found that were not present in the model , they could be added accordingly ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "creating these maps allowed us to be confident that all of the sources in the roi were accounted for and that both the @xmath0-ray sources and roi were represented accurately across the time period under investigation .",
    "no significant sources were detected that had not already been included in the 2fgl catalog , so no additional sources were added to the model .        in order to study the @xmath0-ray characteristics of 3c  454.3 , the correct initial model of the roi was used during the unbinned analyses .",
    "these analyses were then employed to create plots of flux and spectral parameters with time , presented in sections [ sec : taus ] - [ sec : hardness ] . for the unbinned analyses , spectral parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath26 of 3c  454.3 were input as the best - fitting parameters calculated from the binned analysis , but were free to vary during the gtlike fitting procedure .",
    "the spectra of all other sources except for the galactic and extragalactic diffuse backgrounds were frozen at the best - fitting parameters returned by the binned analysis .",
    "blazars are observed to be the most highly variable class of agn .",
    "strong @xmath0-ray flux variability has been captured by the _",
    "fermi_-lat as well as by ground - based instruments , when blazars exhibit an outburst well above their baseline emission .",
    "we use the term baseline to mean emission at a typical flux level for a given blazar . for 3c  454.3 , this is @xmath94.6  @xmath7  @xmath31  ph  @xmath16  s@xmath17 during the period of interest , from the average of our daily fluxes shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : alphabetatime ] . the rapid variability during these flares allows us to probe more closely the physical processes occurring within the relativistic blazar jets .",
    "the timescales on which we see @xmath0-ray emission from an agn vary allow us to constrain the size of the emission region .",
    "we assume that the @xmath0-rays originate from within the relativistic jet , with the two main emission locations under consideration being the blr and the narrow - line or mt region .",
    "the blr is located close to the base of the jet and the smbh , while the torus is further downstream @xcite .",
    "the jet expands and widens with distance from the smbh according to its opening angle ( thought to be of the order of @xmath90.1  rad , @xcite ) , so that the cross - sectional diameter of the jet is smaller in the blr than the mt . if we assume that the entire cross - section of the jet at a certain location is responsible for the emission , the light - crossing time and therefore the @xmath0-ray flux doubling timescale will be smaller for a blr origin .",
    "ground - based telescopes such as h.e.s.s . and",
    "magic have measured @xmath0-ray variability from blazars on extremely short timescales .",
    "examples of these observed flux doubling times include @xmath9220  s @xcite , @xmath92  min @xcite , and more recently <  5  min @xcite .",
    "previous studies using _ fermi _ , such as those done by @xcite and @xcite , have investigated flux doubling timescales using a minimum of 3 hour time bins in the unbinned _ fermi _ analysis .",
    "this duration is often chosen as the minimum because it is the time that the _",
    "fermi_-lat takes to complete one full scan of the sky ( 2 orbits ) . in the case of the fsrq pks  1510 - 089 ,",
    "this revealed intrinsic doubling timescales , @xmath32 , of @xmath33  @xmath3  0.12  h during the october 2011 flare period @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found an observed variability timescale , @xmath34 , of just @xmath35  1.19  h at the @xmath94@xmath4 level for the fsrq 3c  279 during a flare in march 2014 .",
    "another recent study of 3c  279 by @xcite found a characteristic flux rising timescale of only @xmath36  @xmath3  0.8  h and a flux decay timescale of @xmath37  @xmath3  0.59  h , although the fitting errors are relatively large .",
    "however , we can probe down to the smallest timescales using good time interval ( gti ) time bins as described by @xcite .",
    "the gti time bins are uneven in length and are provided with the _ fermi _ raw photon data , with the binning being dependent on the instrument pointing direction @xcite .",
    "the good time intervals are of the order of one orbit of the _ fermi_-lat , @xmath990 minutes .",
    "this analysis technique enabled @xcite to discover the fastest fsrq @xmath0-ray variation measured to date , during the same flare period of pks 1510 - 089 as had been studied in 3 hour time bins .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flux took just @xmath920 minutes to double @xcite .",
    "doubling times of less than one hour enable us to put tight constraints on the size of the emission region .        [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to quantify the position of the emission region , we study the optical depth of different _ emitted _ photon energies with distance from the smbh , both within the blr and beyond .",
    "the expansion of the universe means that _ fermi _ will detect @xmath0-rays at @xmath38 .",
    "the photon optical depth is a measure of how opaque a region is , in terms of how far a @xmath0-ray can travel before being absorbed through @xmath0-@xmath0 pair production in this case .",
    "the intensity of the external photon field at a certain point along the jet dictates the optical depth of @xmath0-rays of energy @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "this is why the optical depth outside the blr is much lower than inside @xcite .",
    "@xcite interpolated the work of @xcite in order to calculate optical depths for the blr region of 3c  454.3 .",
    "they found @xmath41 at 35  gev and @xmath42 at 50  gev , for @xmath0-rays emitted at the mid - point of a spherical blr shell .",
    "these are the _ emitted _ @xmath0-ray energies at the source . in order to interpret these optical depths in the context of our _ fermi _ data",
    ", we need to run analyses on the _ observed _ energies that correspond to _ emitted _ energies of 35  gev and 50  gev .",
    "the optical depths presented by @xcite give a clear indication that we do not expect to observe significant @xmath0-ray emission of @xmath5 35  gev and @xmath5  50  gev if the @xmath0-rays are being emitted at the mid - point of the blr .",

    "@xmath5  35  gev and @xmath5  50  gev gives the fluxes shown in table [ tab : highesig ] at significances of 9.8@xmath4 and 6.8@xmath4 respectively .",
    "these high energy fluxes are both significant , meaning that the emission region during these flares is extremely unlikely to be located in the middle of the blr , due to the high opacity at these energies . the optical depth of the @xmath0-rays will decrease with distance towards the outer edge of the blr and beyond , so it s much more likely that the emission region is towards this outer edge .",
    "however , the existence of an axion - like particle ( alp ) that could facilitate the path of photons through the blr should also be considered .",
    "this mechanism has been postulated in order to explain the detection of vhe emission from distant sources @xcite .    taking the distance to the outer edge of the blr , @xmath8 , to be @xmath93.8 times larger than the inner radius of the blr , @xmath47",
    ", we use the optical depth relations given in @xcite to assess at what distance along the jet the optical depth reaches a value of @xmath48 for @xmath49  gev and @xmath50  gev photons .",
    "we find that in both cases , the optical depth does not decrease to a value of 1 until the emission region is outside the blr . in the case of @xmath49",
    "gev photons , @xmath48 at @xmath94.0  @xmath7 @xmath47 , equivalent to @xmath91.1  @xmath7 @xmath8 . for @xmath50",

    "these results suggest that the emission region of these high energy @xmath0-rays is located outside the blr .        in order to dissect the high energy emission further ,",
    "the _ fermi _ tool gtsrcprob was used to calculate the probability of each detected @xmath5  20  gev photon having been emitted by 3c  454.3 .",
    "only photons within a radius of 0.1@xmath22 around 3c  454.3 were selected for analysis .",
    "[ fig : photonenergies ] shows the individual _ emitted _ energies of the photons that were given a @xmath51  99.7% probability of originating from 3c  454.3 , and the time at which they were detected .",
    "the largest number of these high energy photons are emitted between mjd 56824 and 56835 , corresponding to the fall of the first flare until a few days after the peak of the second flare .",
    "there are 26 photons at @xmath5  20  gev in total , and the highest energy photon that is detected has an energy @xmath52  80  gev .",
    "interestingly , the highest energy photons are detected between mjd 56827 and 56833 , coinciding closely with the second flare .",
    "this analysis of the high energy photons emitted by 3c  454.3 supports the result that there is a spectral hardening between mjd 56830 - 35 , and that significant high energy emission is emitted across the flare .    if the emission region is located at r  @xmath91.3  @xmath7 @xmath8 , a different model for the spectral curvature seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : betaflux ] than pair production within the blr is required . @xcite and @xcite studied the effect of the klein - nishina ( kn ) suppression .",
    "the kn regime of ic scattering that occurs in the blr results in a curvature of the @xmath0-ray spectrum at high energies .",
    "@xcite show in fig .",
    "7 that this suppression alone causes a curvature in the spectrum until at least @xmath98 @xmath7 @xmath47 .",
    "this is consistent with the distance constraint on the emission region derived from the june 2014 data , based on the presence of high energy emission .",
    "[ fig : sed_june_3c454 ] shows the high energy sed of 3c  454.3 at several different epochs , in order to compare the june 2014 flare with previous @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "best - fit sed curves were calculated for each epoch using a third degree polynomial , taking a least - squares approach .",
    "[ fig : sed_june_3c454 ] illustrates that although the june 2014 flare has a lower peak @xmath0-ray flux than previous bright @xmath0-ray flares , it is certainly significantly brighter than the quiescent state of 3c  454.3 .",
    "however , the most notable feature in fig . [ fig : sed_june_3c454 ] is the relative position of the @xmath0-ray peak frequency .",
    "it can be seen for the 2008 , 2009 and 2010 seds that the peak frequency in the _",
    "fermi_-lat energy range corresponds to a photon energy @xmath53  150  mev . for the june 2014 flare on the other hand ,",
    "the peak is shifted to higher energies and lies between the @xmath54  600  mev and @xmath54  1200  mev energy bins .",
    "this is emphasised by the spectral curvature of the 2014 sed between @xmath54  150  mev and @xmath54  2400  mev , compared with the other observations .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath0-ray data for june 2014 illustrate a rise , peak and fall of the ic sed component . for the previous epochs , as the ic peak occurs at lower energies , the @xmath0-ray data show only the fall of the ic component and may not contain the peak .",
    "this indicates that there is relatively more high energy emission in the june 2014 flare , compared with previous flares of 3c  454.3 and the quiescent state observed in 2008 .",
    "it has been discussed by @xcite that @xmath0-ray flares can be observed for a number of different reasons .",
    "these include an injection of particles into the jet , an increase in energy of the particles due to acceleration , and procession and beaming effects ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the movement of the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) ic @xmath0-ray peak of an sed with time can give insight into the mechanism that is causing the flare @xcite . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed_june_3c454 ] , the energy range over which the spectrum of 3c  454.3 is constructed in june 2014 is limited , and to probe the physical processes that are dominating the ic peak would require an extended sed before and after the flare .",
    "even so , if the 2008 sed is an accurate representation of 3c  454.3 during a quiescent state then the shift in peak frequency may be noteworthy . from @xcite , the results of fig . [",
    "fig : sed_june_3c454 ] suggest that an acceleration of the emitting particles may best describe the shift of the sed peak between the quiescent state and the june 2014 flare .",
    "however , as this modelling is based on a ssc model , the results may be more relevant to bl lacs than fsrqs .",
    "[ fig : hardness ] shows the @xmath0-ray flux of 3c  454.3 in 6 hour time bins over the period of interest .",
    "the high energy , @xmath55  gev , and low energy , @xmath56  gev flux have been plotted separately , in order to highlight any energy - dependence that might exist in the rising and falling of the @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "6 hour bins were chosen to provide the balance between adequate statistics and being able to see the detail of the flare structure .",
    "the corresponding hardness ratio of 3c  454.3 , the ratio of high energy flux to low energy flux , @xmath57/@xmath58 , is also shown , and only bins with @xmath59 are considered .",
    "no strong trend of hardness ratio with flux is identified , and the hardness ratio does nt peak simultaneously with the flux .",
    "this may be evidence that the @xmath0-ray flares are not solely due to an increase in flux at the high energy end of the spectrum .    as the energy - dependence of the flare cooling is an indicator of the energy - dependence of the emitting electron cooling , it is of interest to deduce whether or not any energy - dependence of the flare cooling exists , using fig .",
    "[ fig : hardness ] .",
    "if the gradient of the hardness ratio is consistent with zero as the flares cool , the hardness ratio is remaining constant , meaning that the flux is not cooling differentially .",
    "this would indicate that the emission region is located within the blr , with the ic scattering occurring in the kn regime @xcite .",
    "conversely , energy - dependent cooling would manifest itself as a negative correlation of hardness ratio with time , according to our definition of hardness ratio and fig .  3 of @xcite .",
    "we perform a least - squares analysis between mjd 56823.2 and 56827 for the cooling of the first flare , and between mjd 56830.9 and 56834.5 for the second flare , to assess which of the two cases is applicable to our data .",
    "the results show that the hardness ratio is consistent with being constant as both flares cool , due to the large statistical uncertainties on the hardness ratio .",
    "it is also possible that substructures within the flares are masking any overall trend .",
    "although it can be seen that there is variability in the hardness ratio between mjd 56808 and 56855 , we would need less statistical uncertainty to come to a conclusion about the presence of energy - dependent cooling .",
    "in order to draw conclusions on the location of the emission region , we need to combine the emission characteristics from all of the methods discussed in this paper .",
    "the small amount of curvature and hard spectrum seen during the flares indicate an emission region that is not buried deep within the blr .",
    "the optical depth calculations interpolated from @xcite can be used to constrain the location of the emission region , since we observe significant emission of @xmath5  35  gev and @xmath5  50  gev photons . assuming that the @xmath0-rays are not oscillating to alps , optical depth arguments place the emission region at least @xmath601.3 @xmath7 @xmath8 from the smbh .",
    "@xcite used mwl sed modelling to locate the emission region during a high energy activity period of 3c  454.3 , in september 2013 .",
    "they found that the emission region was located at @xmath90.75  pc from the smbh , which is significantly outside the blr , upstream of the torus of 3c  454.3 .",
    "they also found the @xmath0-ray emission region to be located outside of the blr for a number of other high energy fsrqs , and even discovered evidence of the emission originating downstream of the torus in two cases .",
    "mlw studies of the november 2010 flare from 3c  454.3 , such as those by @xcite and , have also concluded that the favoured @xmath0-ray emission model requires an emission location at parsec - scales from the smbh .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission in the model suggested by @xcite results from the scattering of photons reflected by a mirror cloud crossing the jet outflow .",
    "this was supported by the simultaneous variation in the optical continuum , highlighting the benefits of mwl studies .",
    "we observe lower and more stable curvature during the flares compared to during the baseline emission either side , as seen in figs [ fig : alphabetatime ] and [ fig : betaflux ] .",
    "in addition to this , we observe the only significant @xmath45 20  gev emission during the flares .",
    "this could be interpreted as a different origin of the flare emission compared to that of the baseline emission .",
    "the kn suppression is mitigated as the emission region moves further downstream of the smbh and blr @xcite , so the increased curvature during the baseline emission is consistent with both the increased kn suppression and the high energy attenuation from pair production in the blr .",
    "it should , however , be highlighted that the magnitude of the kn suppression is also dependent on the emitting electron energy distribution @xcite .",
    "the increased curvature could be due to poor photon statistics either side of the flares , but the lack of high energy emission during the baseline emission strengthens the conclusion that the curvature is not due to statistics alone .    the change in emission characteristics during the flaring episode",
    "could indicate a multi - zonal emission model , where the baseline emission originates from inside the blr and the flares from outside of the blr .",
    "if we were to make more conservative conclusions based on the presence of the high energy emission , we could say that the flares must originate from the downstream half of the blr or further .",
    "previous studies such as those done by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have concluded that the @xmath0-ray emission regions during the december 2009 and november 2010 flares of 3c  454.3 were located close to the smbh .",
    "a long - term mwl campaign presented by @xcite also concluded that the dominant emission mechanism of @xmath0-rays from 3c  454.3 was the scattering of external photons around the blr .",
    "a multi - zonal model for the flaring emission of 3c  454.3 may therefore also be applicable .",
    "evidence for multiple emission regions , where emission originates in the mt and in the blr simultaneously , was previously found by @xcite for the fsrq pks  1510 - 089 .",
    "this conclusion was primarily based on significant changes to the @xmath0-ray spectral shape between flares separated by only a few days , and the seeming lack of correlation between the hardness ratio and the detection of high energy emission .",
    "it was concluded that one of the flares that @xcite studied originated in the mt , based on the power law spectral shape and presence of high energy emission , similar to what we observe here for 3c  454.3 .    our investigation into the energy - dependence of the electron cooling did not reveal any significant differential cooling .",
    "this would indicate that the emission was originating from inside the blr .",
    "given the opposing evidence , and the fact that we identify variation in the hardness ratio across the flare period , finding no strong decreasing trend in the hardness ratio as the flares cool is most likely due to the high level of statistical uncertainty .",
    "the short flux doubling timescales discussed in section [ sec : taus ] allow us to put an upper limit on the size of the emission region , @xmath61  2.38 @xmath7 @xmath62  pc .",
    "strikingly , there are no corresponding flux halving timescales that are less than 1.5  h. assuming a leptonic model for the ic scattering , @xcite show in their fig .  2 that the cooling of electrons in the blr is much faster than in the mt , for a given energy .",
    "this is because the ic scattering occurs under the thomson regime in the mt rather than the kn regime , due to the lower external photon field energies .",
    "the comparatively slow cooling that we see during the 2014 flares of 3c  454.3 is therefore also in support of an emission region that is not inside the blr .",
    "the size of the blr , @xmath8 , in 3c  454.3 is @xmath90.2  pc @xcite .",
    "therefore , the cross - sectional diameter of the jet at @xmath63 ( @xmath600.26  pc ) , is @xmath90.05  pc if we assume a constant opening angle of @xmath90.1 rad @xcite .",
    "comparing this to the calculated size of the emission region , @xmath61 2.38 @xmath7 @xmath62  pc , the jet at this point is @xmath92 orders of magnitude too large for the emission region to be covering the cross - section of the jet .",
    "this calculation of jet diameter does however assume that the geometry of the jet is constant and cone - like .",
    "studies such as @xcite and @xcite have suggested that this geometry is not the case for all relativistic jets of agn , and that the jets may in fact bend or re - collimate in some cases .",
    "structural observations of the jet are difficult when they are directed so closely towards our line of sight , so it may be the case that the geometry of the jet of 3c  454.3 is also not constant . if the jet of 3c  454.3 does re - collimate , the diameter of the jet at the location of the emission region may be smaller than for our assumed geometry .",
    "we suggest that the @xmath0-ray emission region for the june 2014 flares can be well described as a blob - in - jet outside of the blr .",
    "this is consistent with the short @xmath0-ray flux doubling timescales , the relatively long flux cooling timescales , the presence of significant high energy emission and the low amount of curvature present in the @xmath0-ray spectrum during these flares . characterising the emission region as covering the entire cross - section of the jet",
    "would also be consistent with observations , if we believe that the jet can re - collimate to the size of the emission region downstream of the blr .",
    "in this study , we use data collected by the _ fermi_-lat to examine the 0.1 @xmath64 300  gev @xmath0-ray emission characteristics of 3c  454.3 .",
    "we isolate the period between mjd 56799 and 56855 , during which the fsrq underwent a bright flaring episode spanning @xmath925 days . the @xmath0-ray flux doubling timescales were calculated during the period of interest by binning the data into good time intervals , whilst maintaining a @xmath59 selection criterion .",
    "four intrinsic doubling timescales @xmath32 < 1  h were found , with a fastest doubling timescale of @xmath32 = 0.68 @xmath3 0.01  h. this allows us to calculate an upper limit on the size of the emission region of @xmath65  pc .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectral shape , evidence for high energy emission and the energy - dependence of the electron cooling were investigated in order to constrain the distance of the emission region along the jet .",
    "we find the spectral curvature during the flares to be low and steady in comparison with the baseline @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "we also observe significant @xmath5  35  gev and @xmath5  50  gev emission from 3c  454.3 over the flaring period .",
    "optical depth calculations therefore allow us to constrain the position of the emission region to be outside of the blr , at @xmath6  @xmath7  @xmath8 from the smbh .",
    "the spectral changes when the flares erupt and the lack of @xmath45 20  gev emission either side of the flares lead us to believe that the baseline emission may be originating from a different part of the jet than the flares .",
    "the curvature before and after the flares is larger than during the flares , but better photon statistics during the baseline emission are required to investigate this idea further .",
    "we identify variation in the hardness ratio of the @xmath0-ray flux , but we find no evidence of differential flux cooling times .",
    "we are , however , too limited by statistical uncertainty to make firm conclusions .",
    "we conclude that the flaring emission region is located outside the blr . due to the compact size of the emission region ,",
    "the emission region is either a blob - in - jet or distributed across the cross - section of the jet , depending on the jet geometry .",
    "these conclusions differ from the traditional view of @xmath0-ray emission , both from 3c  454.3 and agn more generally .",
    "they are , however , in support of more recent studies that have reported non - blr emission from fsrqs @xcite and 3c  454.3 in particular @xcite .",
    "we suggest that 3c  454.3 could be another example of an fsrq that emits @xmath0-rays from multiple emission regions .",
    "future work may allow us to gain better photon statistics during the baseline emission , and would enable us to make conclusions on the location of the baseline emission in order to further explore the possibility of a multi - zonal model .",
    "we thank the referee for their comments and suggestions that have improved the quality and clarity of this paper .",
    "we also thank g. bonnoli and collaborators for kindly sharing their data from previous states of 3c  454.3 . this work has made use of public _ fermi _ data obtained from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) , provided by nasa goddard space flight center .",
