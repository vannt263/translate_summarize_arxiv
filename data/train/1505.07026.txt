    "while feshbach resonance and laser intensities provide unprecedented control of atom - atom interactions in the optical lattice , laser interference phenomena provides the control of dimensionality .",
    "two hyperfine states of fermi atoms play the role of the up and down spins of the electrons . unlike condensed matter systems , the population of spin up and down particles can be independently controlled by using a radio - frequency field  @xcite . as a result",
    ", polarization can be maintained at any desired value between 0 and 100% .",
    "the term polarization here refers to a density imbalance of two hyperfine states .",
    "this study was motivated by the possibility of using ultra - cold atoms to engineer condensed matter systems .",
    "condensed matter systems , such as transition metal oxides and rare - earth materials show collective and interaction dominated phenomena due to the electron - electron correlation effects . these phenomena such as the mott - insulator transition and magnetism in strongly correlated materials",
    "is believed to be explained by the hubbard model .",
    "the repulsive hubbard model is the simplest model capable of explaining both metallic and insulating like behaviors , as well as the magnetic properties caused by electron correlation .",
    "the insulating states can be either a band insulator , caused by the pauli exclusion of fermions , or a mott - insulator , caused by strong on - site interactions . in the strong interaction limit , the localized magnetic properties depend on various parameters such as filling factors , orbital occupations , crystal field effects , and hund s coupling strength .    over the years",
    ", the hubbard model has been the center of intense research as it captures the behavior of parent superconducting compounds and other magnetic materials .",
    "the studies of phase separation for the hubbard model intensified after the experimental indication of phase separation of hole - rich and hole - poor regions in cuprate superconducting materials  @xcite . strongly correlated electrons and holes",
    "are expected to play a key role in these materials and their phase separation is believed to hinder the superconductivity . if the hubbard model is the correct model for the parent compound of superconductors , can it be used to explain phase separation ? this is the question that inspired us to study the phase separation of an exactly solvable one - dimensional model relevant to a flexible cold - atom experiment .",
    "it has been theoretically shown that there is no phase separation for two - dimensional bipartite lattices at any filling factors at finite temperatures  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the phase separation for the one dimensional hubbard model is confirmed only close to a half filling in the presence of a critical magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "finite - temperature phase separation for the one dimensional hubbard model away from half filling has not been intensively investigated except for special cases  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the phase separation of one dimensional lattice fermions by bethe ansatz ( tba ) numerical method .",
    "we use the one dimensional hubbard model as an effective model to describe the population - imbalanced two - hyperfine mixture in the optical lattice .",
    "we study phase separation by calculating the compressibility for various parameter regimes . by investigating the compressibility",
    ", we find phase separation at finite temperatures and at intermediate interactions as one increases the polarization .",
    "for some filling factors , we find a re - entrant transition into a mixed phase at a higher polarization .",

    "vi , we draw our conclusions .",
    "in general , a one dimensional optical lattice refers to an optical lattice generated by one set of laser standing waves .",
    "the result of combined trapping and a periodic potential gives a pancake - like shape of the surfaces of constant potential .",
    "however , the geometry we consider here is generated by a three - dimensional optical lattice where reduced dimensionality is achieved by freezing the atomic motion in the transverse direction .",
    "this can be done by operating two standing waves out of three mutually perpendicular laser standing waves at higher beam intensities .",
    "the higher intensities suppress tunneling in the transverse direction and create an array of one - dimensional lattice tubes .",
    "the dynamics of the atoms in one lattice tube can be modeled by the one dimensional hubbard model given by ,    @xmath1    the first term is the kinetic energy and is proportional to the tunneling amplitude @xmath2 between lattice sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the operator @xmath5 creates(destroys ) a fermi atom with hyperfine state denoted by pseudo - spin @xmath6 at lattice site @xmath3 .",
    "the second term describes the on - site interaction energy @xmath7 .",
    "the density operator or the occupation number operator is @xmath8 .",
    "notice that @xmath9 indicates only the nearest neighbor pair of sites and we neglect tunneling beyond the nearest neighbors .",

    "we neglect the confinement harmonic trapping potential and consider the lattice tubes are homogenous in space .",
    "the effect of trapping potential is discussed in section v.    the tunneling amplitude and on - site interaction are related to the complete set of wannier functions @xmath14 localized at position @xmath15 with band index @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are the components of cartesian coordinates . as the band gap becomes larger than @xmath7 and temperature @xmath18 , only the lowest band @xmath19 is populated . for deep lattices ,",

    "as shown in inset , the density is approximately fixed .",
    "the negative compressibility indicates the instability of the mixed phase against the phase - separated state .",
    "notice that the plotted quantities are dimensionless . ]",
    "figure  [ comp1 ] shows the compressibility at a constant interaction strength and a constant finite temperature for various values of density .",
    "the compressibility is always positive close to the densities of half filling and zero filling .",
    "however , away from these two limits , the compressibility becomes negative and then gets positive again as one increases the polarization .",
    "notice the compressibility for filling factors @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the figure .",
    "the negative compressibility indicates the instability of the mixed phase , meaning that the system is phase separated into two different distinct phases corresponding to their pseudo - spins .",
    "a further increase of polarization causes the system to make a re - entrant transition into the mixed phase . in the mixed phase ,",
    "both spin components coexist in the same region of space .",
    "this positive compressibility at higher polarization itself does not guarantee the stability of the mixed phase over the phase separated phase .",
    "one has to compare the energies of phase - separated state and the mixed phase to determine the stability .",
    "the zero - temperature stability of the mixed phase at higher polarizations is justified in ref .",
    "this justification has been confirmed by comparing the ground - state energies in both mixed and phase separated states using both weak and strong coupling approaches .",
    "we believe this is true even for finite temperatures .",
    "the comparison of finite temperature energies of the phase - separated state and the mixed state is not trivial and these calculations are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the zero - temperature instability of the mixed phase at higher polarizations has already been established within the bosonization theoretical frame work  @xcite .",
    "bosonization theory suggests that phase separation occurs for @xmath77\\sin[\\pi(n - m)/2]\\}^{1/2}$ ] . as shown in fig  [ zerot ] ,",

    "the phase diagram is constructed from bosonization theory .",
    "while the shaded region represents the phase separated state , the unshaded region represents the mixed state . ]     for various interaction strengths .",
    "see fig .",

    "[ compftfm ] and fig .",
    "[ compfufm ] respectively . here",
    "the compressibility is calculated at a desired polarization @xmath78 by varying the chemical potential difference @xmath69 and keeping the average chemical potential at a representative fixed value , @xmath79 .",
    "notice that the mixed phase is stable for the entire range of polarization at smaller and larger interactions .",
    "this can be justified by the compressibility at the infinite interaction and non - interacting limits . at the infinite interaction limit",
    ", the tba equations can be solved to get analytical results  @xcite . in the limit @xmath80 , the polarization @xmath81 and",

    "the compressibility at the infinite interaction limit is always positive .",
    "this is intuitive as the system can be considered as spinless fermions in this limit . on the other hand , in the limit @xmath85",
    ", no phase separation occurs as the system consists of non interacting fermions .",
    "again , the negative compressibility at intermediate interactions suggests the phase separation into two pseudo spin states .",
    "consider the temperature dependence shown in fig .",
    "[ compfufm ] .",
    "the mixed phase makes a transition into a phase separated state and then makes a re - entrant transition into mixed phase at higher polarization for low temperatures .",
    "in contrast , the mixed phase is stable for higher temperatures ( small @xmath86 ) over the entire range of polarization .",
    "the high temperature expansion of the thermodynamic potential for the one dimensional hubbard model has been carried up to the fourth order in @xmath86 by charret _",
    "@xcite and up to the sixth order in @xmath86 by takahashi _",
    "et al _  @xcite . by using the 6th order expansion ,",
    "we confirm the positive compressibility at higher temperatures by an analytic calculation . the high temperature expansion of the compressibility and the polarization up to the sixth order is given in the appendix .",
    "notice that compressibility is a non - monotonic function of polarization for all temperatures and interactions .",
    "in contrast , compressibility is a non - monotonic function of the interaction parameter only for larger polarizations .",
    "however , as evident from the fig .",
    "[ compftfm ] , compressibility is a monotonic function of temperature for the entire range of polarizations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a small density imbalance can be induced in condensed matter electronic systems by applying an external magnetic field .",
    "thermodynamic properties of such one dimensional systems are thoroughly discussed in ref .",
    "though finite temperature compressibility as a function of polarization is not discussed in there , special attention has been given to the ground - state properties such as susceptibility , magnetization , and densities  @xcite .",
    "recent progress in experimental techniques with ultra - cold atoms , such as single - site detection  @xcite , noise correlations  @xcite , bragg scattering  @xcite , and _ in situ _ imaging in the lattice scaling  @xcite , allows one to probe the density variations in cold - atom experiments . for the case of equal - population two - component fermions on a three - dimensional cubic lattice ,",

    "we fixed the on - site interaction ( @xmath91 ) and the inverse temperature ( @xmath92 ) . ]",
    "though we neglected it in this study , the underlying harmonic trapping potential present in all cold gas experiments causes the density to vary across the lattice .",
    "see fig .",

    "[ pol ] , the density monotonically decreases , while polarization monotonically increases from the center to the edge of the trap  @xcite .",
    "this trapping potential induced inhomogeneity allows both mixed - phase and phase - separated states to exist simultaneously inside the trap . at the center of the trap ,",
    "the density is higher and the polarization is lower . on the other hand , the polarization is higher and the density is lower at the edge of the trap . as a result ,",
    "the mixed - phase should exist at the center and at the edge of the trap .",
    "however , depending on the density , the phase separated state can exists in the middle ( not the center ) of the trap .",
    "therefore , by adjusting the total density in the trap , any polarization induced phase separation and re - entrant transition can be investigated experimentally with currently available experimental techniques .",
    "in conclusion , we considered two - component fermi atoms in a highly tunable optical lattice to study the phase separation of fermions in one dimension .",
