    "numerous examples of the field counterparts to the extremely cool methane brown dwarf gl229b @xcite are now known @xcite .",
    "these objects are now uniformly classified as `` t dwarfs '' @xcite , and have such low photospheric temperatures ( 800 - 1300k ) , that their photospheres are dominated by the effects of dust and methane formation @xcite , neither of which are amenable to simple modeling .",
    "the discovery of sizable numbers of t dwarfs , means that we are now in a position to use direct trigonometric parallax observations to _ empirically _ determine the loci of t dwarf cooling curves , rather than relying on models .",
    "the discovery of several t dwarfs by sdss with spectra bridging the l and t spectral types ( e.g. @xcite ) means we are also in a position to empirically determine where on these brown dwarf cooling curves the l - t transition occurs .",
    "trigonometric parallaxes are also essential to understanding the space density of t dwarfs .",
    "luminosity function estimates for t dwarfs ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) are currently based on limited parallaxes and assumptions about object binarity .",
    "( recent programs targeting more l and t dwarfs @xcite , indicate that @xmath110 - 20% of objects observed in sufficient detail are found to be binary . )",
    "luminosity functions based on currently available colour - magnitude relations will therefore be problematic at best .",
    "trigonometric parallaxes are therefore required to determine the _ actual _ luminosities of these objects and indicate whether they are single or binary , so that more meaningful luminosity functions for t dwarfs can be constructed .",
    "traditional parallax techniques based on photography are completely unable to target objects as faint and red as t dwarfs .",
    "ccd parallax work in the optical at the usno , eso and palomar @xcite have shown that parallaxes can be obtained for objects as faint as i=18 - 19 at distances @xmath270pc . however",
    ", this still leaves the t dwarf class of objects ( with i@xmath321 ) unobservable . to date",
    "only a few of the very brightest and closest t dwarfs have proved tractable for ccd parallax work @xcite .    over the last two years , therefore , we have been extending optical ccd astrometric techniques into the infrared , where the j@xmath416 magnitudes of most of the detected t dwarfs make significant progress possible .",
    "indeed , there are several reasons to _ prefer _ the infrared for high precision astrometry .",
    "first , the effects of differential colour refraction ( the different amount of refraction the atmosphere produces in red target stars , compared to blue reference stars , see @xcite ) are reduced by working at longer wavelengths .",
    "second , because t dwarfs suffer methane absorption at the red end of their j- and h - band spectra , their effective wavelengths through a j- or h - filter are much closer to that of a typical background reference star , than is the case in the optical . these effects combined mean that the stringent requirements on maintaining control of observations at constant hour angles ( at least for t dwarfs ) is not present in the infrared ( cf",
    ". section [ sec_dcr ] ) .",
    "this _ considerably _ increases the flexibility and efficiency of infrared parallax observing , over the optical .",
    "third , seeing improves in the infrared , leading to smaller images , smaller amounts of differential seeing , and so higher astrometric precision . and",
    "finally , t dwarfs show _ much _ greater contrast to sky in the near - infrared than in the optical .",
    "infrared parallax observations have been pioneered by @xcite , who targeted the extremely active ( and unfortunately at 76pc also quite distant ) late m dwarf pc0025 + 0447 , as well as the nearby m dwarf vb10 .",
    "the usno also has an infrared astrometric program in operation , from which published results are expected shortly @xcite .",
    "observations were carried out at 7 epochs over the period 2000 april 17 to 2002 may 30 . at each epoch , observations were carried out on either two half- or two full - nights .",
    "all observations were obtained with the sofi infrared camera on the european southern observatory ( eso ) 3.5 m new technology telescope ( ntt ) .",
    "sofi was used in its `` large field '' mode in which it provides a 4.92@xmath54.92field - of - view with 0.28826  pixels ( cf .",
    "section [ scale ] ) .",
    "exposures of each target were acquired with a fixed dither pattern ( fig .",
    "[ jitter ] ) as eight 120s exposures though the sofi j filter .",
    "the exposure pattern was designed so that this 16 minutes of dithered exposure time sampled many different inter - pixel spacings .",
    "as much as was feasible ( given observing time constraints ) we attempted to acquire all epoch observations at the same hour angle as the very first epoch observation acquired , so as to minimise dcr effects . each epoch observation was also carried out with a specified reference star positioned within a few pixels of its position when observed on the very first epoch .",
    "this ensures all observations are carried out as near differentially as possible .",
    "seeing conditions over the course of this program varied .",
    "figure [ seeing ] shows a histogram of the seeing full - width at half maxmimum for all our astrometric observations .",
    "the median seeing was 0.82 , with 80% of data being acquired in seeing conditions between 0.55 and 1.25 .",
    "in addition to these epoch observations , all targets were also observed as they rose and set , so that dcr calibrations for each target could be developed , following the technique described in @xcite .",
    "the j filter was chosen for these observations as it offers the best contrast between sky- and t dwarf brightness .",
    "typical near - infrared sky colours at la silla are j ",
    "h=1.7 , h ",
    "k=1.0 - 2.0 ( 2.0 for dark , 1.0 for bright ) ( eso sofi on - line documentation ) .",
    "by contrast typical t dwarf colours are -0.5@xmath4j  h@xmath40.5 and h ",
    "k@xmath40.5 @xcite , which means most t dwarfs are around a magnitude brighter compared to the sky in j , than they are in h or k.    the sample of objects observed is listed in table [ sample ] , along with indications as to which targets were observed at which epochs .",
    "sofi has a nominal gain of 5.6e-/adu , and a nominal read - noise of 14e- per exposure .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]              with the exception of @xmath6indb @xcite , all the objects discussed in this paper have been discovered by either the 2mass ( www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass ) , sdss ( www.sdss.org ) or denis ( cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/denis.html ) sky surveys , and have been given object names by those surveys , based on their positions in j2000 coordinates .",
    "these names have the advantage of being very specific and informative , and the disadvantage of being lengthy and clumsy . throughout this paper , therefore , we will generally give an object s complete name when it is first used , and thereafter refer to it ( when not confusing to do so ) by a shortened 2mhhmm , sdhhmm or dhhmm form where hh and mm are the right ascension hour and minute components of its name .",
    "the analysis adopted for these data falls into two main areas : processing to produce linearised , flattened and sky subtracted images , which was quite specific to the sofi instrument ; and astrometric processing of these images , which identically follows that described in @xcite .      * dark frames and zero - points * : dark frames obtained with sofi reveal significant structure , which can be broken down into a few components .    1 .   a significant ( @xmath150 - 100adu peak - to - peak ) vertical structure , known as the `` shade '' , which varies in intensity and shape with the overall level of illumination of the array ; 2 .   a small ( 1 - 20adu ) dark current from the instrument and a small readout amplifier glow in each quadrant ; and 3 .",
    "a tiny ( @xmath41adu ) but fixed `` ray '' pattern left after the previous two are modeled and removed from dark current data .",
    "the shade pattern is of most concern as the remaining fixed patterns are small compared to the sky brightness .",
    "figure [ shade ] shows a dark current image displaying the shade effect , together with a set of vertical medianned profiles through the shade .",
    "unfortunately , this shade profile is not constant - it varies with the intensity of the overall level of illumination of the array during an exposure , meaning one has an unknown zero - point for every pixel in every exposure .",
    "calibration of the shade was achieved as follows . a small aperture ( used to mask the instrument entrance when observing with one of the smaller fields of view )",
    "was inserted into the ntt focal plane , and a series of flat fields obtained with varying exposure times . because only the central quarter of the array is illuminated by this procedure ,",
    "it is possible to extract a shade profile from the edge of each image .",
    "it is also possible to record the level of illumination of the array which produced that shade profile . by performing a least - squares cubic polynomial fit through each pixel of these shade profiles ( which correspond to rows on the detector ) as a function of array illumination",
    ", it is possible to develop a parametrization for the shade profile . using this parametrization",
    "it is a simple matter to produce a shade profile estimate for each data image , and subtract it .",
    "the result is an image with zero - point constant across the array .",
    "* linearity * : all infrared detectors are non - linear to some extent . for sofi , eso usually recommends keeping sky and target object intensities below 10,000adu in order to maintain linearity at better than 1% .",
    "unfortunately , such an observing strategy is not useful for astrometry , which demands the largest possible dynamic range to ensure targets ( and reference stars ) of widely differing magnitudes are usable in widely varying seeing conditions .",
    "we therefore calibrated the linearity of sofi using the same shade profile data obtained above .",
    "once the data have been shade corrected , they can then be used to examine the response of each pixel to a constant light source over widely varying exposure times .",
    "repetition of a calibration exposure time throughout the sequence allows the lamp s constancy to be calibrated  usually to within @xmath7 0.5% . a sample of the resulting linearity correction is shown in fig .",
    "[ samplelin ] for one of the sofi quadrants . in all cases",
    "these tests were performed independently for each quadrant , and the results were always consistent with the same linearity correction for all quadrants .",
    "a single correction was therefore derived as the mean of those in each quadrant .",
    "[ samplelin ] shows that the detector is @xmath82.5% non - linear at 20,000adu above bias , _ but _ that data can be obtained and linearity corrected even up to 25,000adu .        to linearise a pixel , then , with raw intensity @xmath9 ,",
    "it is simply necessary to multiply it by the polynomial p(@xmath9 ) = @xmath10 .",
    "the coefficients adopted were @xmath11 for 2000 april - 2001 april , and @xmath12 for 2001 july - 2002 may .",
    "* inter - quadrant row crosstalk * : hgcdte detectors typically show an effect known as inter - quadrant row crosstalk @xcite .",
    "this has the effect that a constant , small fraction of the total flux seen in each row is seen as crosstalk at the same row in all the other quadrants .",
    "correction of this effect is straightforward .",
    "the detector is integrated up into a single vertical column , then the two halves of this cut ( y=1 - 512 and y=513 - 1024 ) are averaged , multiplied by a single cross - talk constant , and subtracted from every column of the detector .",
    "we found a crosstalk coefficient of 2.8@xmath510@xmath13 worked well .    *",
    "flat - fielding * : flat - fielding was performed using dome flats .",
    "because of the ( variable ) shade pattern present in every dome flat , ntt staff have developed an observing recipe to obtain a `` special '' flat - field without a shade pattern present . or one can used the shade calibration procedure described above to correct standard dome - flat fields . both were tried for this program and both provided similar results . in the end",
    "every run s data was flattened with a `` special '' dome flat , as per usual for sofi observing .    * sky subtraction * : each group of eight 120s dithered exposures",
    "was then used to create a normalised and medianned sky frame , which was re - normalised to each of the twelve observations to perform sky subtraction .",
    "so that the data frames would maintain approximate photon - counting errors , an appropriate constant sky level was then added back in to each frame    * astrometric processing * : following this processing then , we have eight bias - subtracted , linearised , cross - talk corrected , flattened and sky - subtracted data frames for each astrometric epoch .",
    "these were then subject to further processing ( ie .",
    "object finding and point - spread function fitting using daophot , dcr calibration and proper - motion and parallax solution fitting ) as eight individual observations , in a manner identical to that described in @xcite .",
    "astrometric calibration observations were acquired in usno astrometric calibration region m @xcite on 2001 july 12 and 13 . these consisted of sixteen 60s exposures ( on each night ) scattered throughout the 3.2@xmath57.6region which @xcite have astrometrically calibrated .",
    "these were processed identically to our main astrometric targets .",
    "reference catalogue positions were extracted from the usno acr catalogue in sofi - field - sized regions around each nominal telescope pointing position .",
    "these positions were then tangent projected ( using the slalib library @xcite ) to provide reference data sets in arcsecond offsets on the sky for each observation .",
    "these were matched against the observed data to derive a set of linear ( ie shift , scale and rotate ) transformations from the sofi pixel positions to arcsecond offsets on the sky .",
    "these transformations determine the sofi plate scale on this night to be 0.28826@xmath70.00003/pixel , and that the detector pixel s misalignment with n - s ( 0.030@xmath70.003 ) .",
    "these data were also analysed to examine the amount of astrometric distortion ( ie .",
    "variability in the instrument plate scale with position in the field ) present in the sofi optical train .",
    "the astrometric calibration data show there is no significant astrometric distortion in the sofi large field optics .",
    "the plate scale in the field corners is the same as that in the field center to within 0.1% .",
    "the sofi field can be considered astrometrically flat to 0.1% .",

    "uncertainties arising from the dcr correction and the residuals about the reference frame transformation for each frame were carried through to this solution fit , so observations taken in poor seeing or with poor signal - to - noise due to cloud autmoatically receive low weight .",
    "the final parallax was taken to be the weighted mean of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 solutions .",

    "plots of these fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ plots ] .",
    "the reference stars used to obtain this relative astrometry are typically within @xmath71mag . of the apparent magnitude of our target t dwarf . at these magnitudes ( j=15 - 18 ) the reference stars",
    "will most commonly be g- to early m type stars at distances of 500 - 2000pc .",
    "thus although we do not have the photometry available to estimate detailed corrections from relative to absolute parallax , we can estimate with some confidence , that such corrections will generally be less than 1mas in size , and so not significant in comparison to our random astrometric uncertainties .",
    "it is instructive to examine the root - mean - square residuals obtained for the reference frame stars in our astrometry , since they tell us how precise we can expect the astrometry of our target objects to be . over the course of our program we found that for a single 120s exposure , the median value of this rms residual was 0.042pixel or 12.1mas , with 80% of observations having an rms residual between 6.9 and 20.2mas .",
    "recall that at each epoch we acquired 8 such observations in a total exposure time of 960s , which would suggest the median precision from a single epoch is 12.1/sqrt(8 ) = 4.3mas .",
    "residuals within these groups of eight were somewhat correlated ( presumably because they are largely acquired in similar seeing conditions ) .",
    "the usno have published astrometry for three t dwarfs : 2mass0559 , sdss1254 & sdss1624 @xcite .",
    "while all three were included in our program , insufficient epochs were obtained for 2mass0559 to measure a parallax .",
    "the equivalent relative parallax solution quantities for those we obtained ( table [ results ] ) , are given by dahn et al .",
    "as ; for sdss1254 - 01 : 84.1@xmath71.9mas , 496.1@xmath71.8mas / y , 285.2@xmath70.4 , and for sdss1624 + 00 : 90.7@xmath72.3mas , 383.2@xmath71.9mas / y , 269.6@xmath70.5 . these independent observations and solutions agree within uncertainties for almost all parameters  the exception being the parallax for sdss1254 , for which the two solutions are different by about 5-@xmath0 , though dahn et al .",
    "do comment that with only 1.2 years of data on this target their solution is only considered to be preliminary .",
    "finally we note that with only 3 epochs of observation per year over two - plus years , there is always the possibility that systematic errors on individual runs may have impacted on our results .",
    "for example , a major change in sofi s astrometric distortion or a decollimation between the telescope and sofi on a single run could systematically effect our results .",
    "the only way to detect such problems is by detecting a poor match between our astrometric model and the data we obtain , which is difficult with less than 6 epochs .",
    "we believe the likelihood of this is small because ; ( 1 ) exactly the same automated telescope image analysis procedures were used to control the ntt s primary figure throughout every night of every run , making the chance of an unusual ntt collimation with sofi unlikely ; ( 2 ) sofi s astrometric distortion ( as we have shown above ) is tiny , so changes in it can have only negligible effect ; ( 3 ) sofi is a nasmyth mounted instrument , and so is always mounted horizontally and subject only to rotation about its optical axis , greatly reducing the likelihood of flexure within the instrument ; and finally ( 4 ) because infrared instruments sit in temperature - controlled dewars they suffer almost none of the temperature - dependent flexure and defocus effects present in optical reimaging systems , and they are also much less prone to being opened and modified over the course of an astrometric program .",
    "on - going monitoring and independent observations by independent programs are the best way to test for unforeseen systematic errors , and we look forward to checking our results against programs being carried out elsewhere .",
    "an interesting result of the dcr calibrations we performed for our t dwarf targets , was to find that t dwarfs have effective wavelengths in the j - band which are essentially indistinguishable from the ensemble of background reference stars against which their positions are measured .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ dcrhist ] which plots histograms of the dcr coefficients determined for reference stars and programme t dwarfs - the similarities in the ensemble values are clear .",
    "( these coefficients were derived using the method described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "typical uncertainties in the individual determinations are @xmath25mas@xmath26tan(za ) . ) as a result , though we have calibrated and applied dcr corrections to our data , such a procedure is not strictly necessary for near - infrared observations of t dwarfs .",
    "these observations , therefore , are _ not _ rigidly tied to being carried out near the meridian , which adds enormously to the flexibility and efficiency of infrared parallax programmes .",
    "there are currently only a few large and systematic photometric databases for late m , l and t dwarfs extant .",
    "the first is the photometry from the 2mass database @xcite , which has the advantage of being a well established photometric system which covers the whole sky , and includes all of our t dwarf targets , and almost of all of the other known l and t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the photometry for these objects in the j and k@xmath24 2mass bands is often near the 2mass photometric limits , so typical uncertainties of @xmath70.1mag . or greater are not uncommon .",
    "moreover , because 2mass does not include an optical passband , colour information has to rely on the j  k colour , which is typically small compared to the photometric precision , as well as giving only a small wavelength `` lever arm '' on the spectral evolution of l and t dwarfs .",
    "we make use of absolute m@xmath27 and m@xmath28 values on the 2mass system compiled by @xcite which is based on the parallaxes presented in @xcite .",
    "@xcite also present optical photometry in the @xmath29 passband , and j , h , k photometry in a photometric system approximating that of the cit system of @xcite , as well as data form other work transformed onto this system .",
    "a second extensive database is that compiled by @xcite .",
    "this includes z band photometry ( on a ukirt defined photometric system ) as well as j , h , k photometry transformed by the authors onto the mko photometric system ( see @xcite , section 3 for details ) . because these data were acquired with a 4 m telescope , their photometric precision is much higher than that for 2mass .",
    "great care should be taken in inter - comparing these two sets of photometry  the systematic differences between the two photometric systems are _ very _ significant .",
    "this is _ particularly _ true of the z photometric system of @xcite , which is based on a relatively narrow interference filter ( 0.851 - 1.056@xmath30 m ) used with a hgcdte infrared array , leading to effective wavelengths for l and t dwarfs of @xmath81.0@xmath30 m , unlike the more common optical z - type observations which are based on long - pass filters ( @xmath30.85@xmath30 m ) and the declining sensitivity of ccds at @xmath311@xmath30 m , leading to effective wavelengths @xmath80.9@xmath30 m .. ukirt z photometry should not be assumed to be directly comparable with optically based z photometry . in the discussion that follows , therefore , we will discuss only features in the absolute magnitudes _ within an individual photometric system_. for this reason we do not make use of the more heterogeneous j , h , k compilation of @xcite .",
    "to these data sets we add observations of the recently announced t dwarf @xmath6indb @xcite , which has a mean i=16.7@xmath70.1 and 2mass photometry of j=11.91@xmath70.04 and ks=11.21@xmath70.04 ( burgasser , priv.comm . ) .",

    "indeed , both sets of data indicate a strong inflection ( a `` hump '' ) in the relationship between absolute magnitude and spectral type for early t dwarfs  as a class , the t0-t4 brown dwarfs have absolute magnitudes _ brighter _ than the latest l dwarfs by a magnitude or more .",
    "put another way , a simple extrapolation of the spectral - type - magnitude relationship for l dwarfs ( eg . that from @xcite shown in the figure ) underestimates the absolute magnitude of the early- to mid - t dwarfs by up to two magnitudes .",
    "this `` early t hump '' has been noted previously @xcite , though on the basis on fewer t dwarf parallaxes .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that binarity could be the cause for early t dwarfs being more luminous than the late l dwarfs .",
    "while it is certainly true that the l and t dwarfs which have been resolved as binaries are displaced to apparently high absolute magnitudes when plotted as unresolved objects , the addition of new parallaxes would seem to indicate the over - luminosity of early t dwarfs is a general property , rather than being due to the selection of objects which happen to be binaries .",
    "moreover , the magnitude or more of over - luminosity is too large an effect to be due equal - mass binarity which can produce a brightening of only 0.75mag .",
    "a similar ( though possibly less pronounced ) inflection is seen in the m@xmath39 relation ( fig .",
    "[ abs_spt]f ) , while the m@xmath36 relation ( fig .",
    "[ abs_spt]e ) would appear to be almost as monotonic as that at k , though with a more pronounced inflection at the l - t boundary .",

    "@xcite failed to resolve a binary companion in this system with hst , implying that if it is a binary it must have a separation of less than 0.5a.u .",
    "we also note that it has been suggested @xcite that the selection of preferentially young objects could produce the `` early t hump ''  we discuss this further in section [ sec_hump ] .",
    "there are good physical reasons for expecting a monotonic relationship between effective temperature ( t@xmath40 ) and luminosity ( l ) in these objects , since these quantities are directly determined by interior ( rather than photospheric ) properties .",
    "however , it must be remembered that as proxies for t@xmath40 and luminosity , absolute magnitude in a given passband and spectral type are far from perfect .",
    "spectral typing is in essence an arbitrary allocation of a quantity to an object based on what its spectra look like  there is no guarantee that the relationship between spectral type and t@xmath40 ( even if monotonic ) should not have significant changes in slope .",
    "similarly , the relationship between absolute magnitude in a given passband and luminosity is even more problematic . from the spectra of objects ranging from l to t spectral types , and indeed from their j  k colours @xcite , we know that _ significant _ changes take place in their photospheres",
    ". there is significant redistribution of flux in the spectra of brown dwarfs across the l - t transition .",
    "we should not be surprised if this results in the relationship between luminosity absolute magnitude in a given passband not only containing changes in slope , but not even being monotonic",
    ".    given our current parallax database , spectral type is a very poor proxy for absolute magnitude in the z and j bands from mid - l to mid - t spectral types .",
    "the sequences in fig.[abs_spt ] will need to be filled in by many more l and t dwarfs before precise absolute magnitudes can be estimated from spectral types with confidence .                  using the same photometry , we can construct a variety of colour - magnitude diagrams .",

    "colour magnitude diagrams involving z  k ( figs [ cmd_iz]g - h ) and j  k ( figs [ cmd_jk]a - d ) show an especially pronounced reversal of the brown dwarf cooling curves beyond m@xmath44 , m@xmath45 and m@xmath46 .",
    "this has been noted in j  k colour - magnitude diagrams by several authors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "major changes take place in photospheres below the l - t transition , with the result that t dwarfs swap from very red , to very blue , j  k colours .",
    "it is interesting that the z ",
    "k diagrams show almost identical behavior , with z  k colours for the very faintest t dwarfs becoming as blue as z - k@xmath8 - 1 .",
    "this compares with colours based on the sdss @xmath47 filter ( see eg.@xcite fig .",
    "3 ) which continue to become redder for the latest t dwarfs .",
    "this once again clearly demonstrates the considerable difference between ccd - based @xmath47 , and the hgcdte - based z.    there is a clear warning to astronomers implicit in these diagrams  conclusions reached about luminosity- and mass - functions based on luminosity and/or colours for the l - t effective temperature range are fraught with difficulty .",
    "in particular , luminosity functions determined from the colours of objects in field samples will produce completely spurious features in the derived luminosity- and mass - functions , unless the various `` bumps and wiggles '' in these diagrams are adequately and correctly modeled .",
    "( see for example @xcite s demonstration of the formation of a `` false '' peak in m dwarf luminosity function based on the traditional  and inadequate ",
    "parametrization of the m dwarf colour - magnitude relation ) .",
    "similarly , determining bolometric luminosity functions from apparent magnitudes in cluster - based samples is problematic , as we can expect similar  bumps and wiggles \" to be present in the bolometric correction relations for the l and t dwarfs .",
    "features like these can introduce significant _ systematic _ biases into the mass functions derived from even a perfect statistical sample .",

    "monte carlo simulations are essential to the interpretation of any luminosity- or mass - function in the l - t effective temperature range .",
    "it is important to carefully `` reverse '' model such functions from sets of mass - function models , through a variety of possible colour - magnitude and bolometric - correction relations ( as allowed by the extant data ) , to sample observational data .",
    "then such artificial data can then be meaningfully compared to statistical samples _ in the observational plane_. mass- or luminosity functions which do _ not _ include such extensive reverse modeling should be treated with the utmost suspicion .",
    "ultra - cool dwarfs are notoriously difficult to model ",
    "the components which need to be included in models for l and t dwarfs include @xcite : the effects of tens of millions of molecular transitions in species including h@xmath48o , ch@xmath49 , tio , vo , crh , feh , and a host of others ; complex treatments of the line wings of enormously h@xmath48 and he pressure - broadened neutral alkali lines like k and na , rb and cs ; collision - induced molecular h@xmath48 opacity ; both the chemistry and opacity involved in the condensation , settling , revapourisation and diffusion of a variety of condensates including liquid fe , solid vo , and a range of aluminium , calcium , magnesium and titanium bearing refractories ; and finally ( and least readily modeled of all ) the effects of rotation - induced weather on the cloud decks which condensates will form .",
    "significant progress has been made in recent years on the detailed solution of photospheric models using very large line lists ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "probably the largest outstanding problem for modelers of l and t dwarfs is dealing with condensation .",
    "three approximations to this complex situation have currently been implemented .",
    "`` dusty '' models ( eg . the dusty model of @xcite ) assume condensates remain well suspended and in chemical equilibrium where they form in the photosphere . in general such models have been shown to work reasonably well for l dwarfs , suggesting that their cloud layers lie within their photospheres .",
    "`` condensation '' models ( eg . the cond models of @xcite , and the clear models of @xcite ) neglect dust opacities , to simulate the removal of all condensates from the photosphere as they form ( most likely through gravitational settling ) .",
    "the `` cloudy '' models of @xcite and @xcite incorporate a model for condensate cloud formation , based on an assumed sedimentation efficiency parameter @xmath50 .",
    "figures [ cmd_iz ] and [ cmd_jk ] have over - plotted on them a variety of these models , including the dusty @xcite and cond models @xcite for an age of 1gyr , and the clear and cloudy models as presented in @xcite for @xmath51 ( determined as the best fit for this model in jupiter s ammonia cloud deck @xcite ) . as previous studies have shown ,",
    "dusty models reproduce the general features ( if not the precise colours ) of the cooling curves for l dwarfs , but then proceed to much redder colours than are observed beyond l8 .",
    "this has been interpreted as indicating that condensates are present in the photosphere of l dwarfs .",
    "the cond and clear models reproduce the general features of the cooling curves for late t dwarfs , indicating that at these effective temperatures condensate opacities do not contribute to the radiative transfer , which suggests that the condensate layers have dropped below the photosphere .",
    "dusty and clear / cond models , therefore , describe the `` boundary conditions '' to the condensate opacity problem , and are appropriate for the l and late t types respectively .",
    "but what about the intermediate case which must be appropriate to early t dwarfs ?",
    "this is exactly the situation with the sedimentation models of @xcite should be able to address .",

    "@xcite suggested that a possible resolution for this discrepancy could be the appearance of uneven cloud cover on the surface of early t dwarfs .",
    "this would allow the emergent spectrum to appear as a `` mixture '' of the clear / cond and cloudy spectra .",
    "they modeled this by interpolating between their clear and cloudy models at effective temperatures of 800k , 1000k , 1200k , 1400k , 1600 and 1800k with varying fractions of the two models ( ie .",

    "unfortunately , interpreting the `` early t hump '' as an age effect is severely complicated by the fact that it occurs at _ exactly _ the point where there is good evidence to believe neither the dusty or cond models are working .    for the l dwarfs and late t dwarfs , the spread in the colour - magnitude diagram is not pronounced , ( particularly when known binaries are decomposed ) , suggestive of the small 100myr ",
    "1gyr age spread seen in other studies of l and t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "it is certainly nowhere near as pronounced as would be necessary to produce the age spread required to account for the more than 1magnitude brightening of the``early t hump '' all by itself .",
    "moreover , there is a definite spectral type trend _ along _ the track represented by the `` early t hump '' , as seen in the spectral - type - magnitude diagrams of fig .",
    "[ abs_spt ]  from the late l dwarfs , through @xmath6indb , sd1254 , sd1021 to 2m0559 .",
    "this same trend is seen in the colour - magnitude diagrams .",
    "we interpret this as indicating that the `` early t hump '' truly is a feature in the cooling curve of brown dwarfs , rather than an artifact of youth and selection .",
    "methane filters centered on the strong ch@xmath49 absorption bands in the h - band have been acquired by a number of observatories for use in their infrared cameras .",
    "given we have now measured just where , in absolute magnitude , the t dwarf class occurs , the question arises , `` at what magnitudes will ch@xmath49 absorption in young star clusters set in ? '' fig .",
    "[ cmd_h ] shows ukirt m@xmath27 and m@xmath53:j  k colour - magnitude diagrams , along with the dusty and cond models at ages from 10myr to 5gyr .",
    "based on these diagrams , we can conclude that for field t dwarfs , as discovered by the 2mass and sdss surveys , ch@xmath54 absorption ( corresponding to spectral classes around t2 and later ) sets in at at m@xmath53@xmath813 , and somewhat more confusingly at m@xmath27@xmath114  though because of the brightening of `` early t hump '' at j non - ch@xmath49-absorbing l dwarfs will actually be fainter than the earliest ch@xmath49 absorbing t dwarfs .    because the turn on of ch@xmath49 absorption is primarily an effect driven by effective temperature , to _",
    "first order _ it will occur at the same absolute magnitude in young clusters as it does in the field",
    ". looked at in slightly more detail , however , we can see that for a given colour in fig .",
    "[ cmd_h ] , there is a small offset to brighter magnitudes for younger objects  in the dusty atmosphere case a 10myr dwarf at the end of the l8 sequence will be @xmath81.0mag .",
    "brighter than a 1gyr dwarf of the same colour and effective temperature , and 1.3mag brighter than a 5gyr dwarf . in the cond case",
    "the equivalent differences are 1.3 and 1.7 magnitudes .",
    "the likely ages for our field t dwarfs will be somewhere in the range 100myr-1gyr @xcite .",
    "this would suggest that in clusters like ic2391 or ic2602 of age 10 - 20myr at d@xmath8150pc the absolute magnitude for ch@xmath49 onset will be m@xmath53@xmath112 - 12.5 , or equivalently h@xmath118 - 18.5 . for older clusters like the pleiades ( 100myr , d@xmath1125pc ) these numbers are more like m@xmath53@xmath112.5 - 13 or h@xmath118-18.5.both of these are eminently reachable magnitude limits with wide - field cameras on 4m - class telescopes , suggesting that ch@xmath49 imaging may be a powerful tool for easily conducting an unbiased census of t dwarfs in large open clusters .",
    "similarly for more compact , but distant clusters , like trapezium ( @xmath125myr , 450pc ) observations at h@xmath120 - 20.5 are tractable over the fields - of - view required on 8m - class telescopes .",
    "[ cmd_h ] also has implications for the interpretation of potential cluster membership .",
    "for example , @xcite have found a t6 dwarf in the direction of the @xmath0orionis cluster .",
    "[ cmd_h ] suggests that a field brown dwarf of this spectral type will have m@xmath53=15.0@xmath70.5 . for the much younger age of @xmath0orionis ( 1 - 8myr @xcite ) this will be more like m@xmath53=14.0@xmath70.5 , which would imply a distance to the @xmath0orij053810.1 - 023626 t6 dwarf of 192@xmath750pc  more consistent with being a foreground object than a member of the cluster at d=352pc @xcite .",
    "figures [ abs_spt ] and [ cmd_iz ] have over - plotted on some of their panels high - order polynomial fits to the weighted ( and binary decomposed ) data . as inspection of the figures shows ,",
    "these fits are not always particularly successful at modeling the extremely complex behaviour of these cooling curves in the observed passbands .",
    "nonetheless , in the absence of working atmospheric models the fits may be a useful tool , so long as their weaknesses are acknowledged .",
    "we therefore provide the coefficients for these fits , and the root - mean - square scatter about the fits in table [ fits ] .",
