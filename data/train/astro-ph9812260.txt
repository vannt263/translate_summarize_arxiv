    "we have developed a model which aims to reproduce self - consistently observational data of many kinds related to cosmic - ray origin and propagation : direct measurements of nuclei , antiprotons , electrons and positrons , @xmath0-rays , and synchrotron radiation .",
    "these data provide many independent constraints on any model and our approach is able to take advantage of this since it must be consistent with all types of observation .    a numerical method and corresponding computer code ( galprop ) for the calculation of galactic cosmic - ray propagation in 3d has been developed .",
    "the basic spatial propagation mechanisms are ( momentum - dependent ) diffusion and convection , while in momentum space energy loss and diffusive reacceleration are treated .",
    "fragmentation and energy losses are computed using realistic distributions for the interstellar gas and radiation fields .",
    "the code is sufficiently flexible that it can be extended to include new aspects as required .",
    "the basic procedure is first to obtain a set of propagation parameters which reproduce the cosmic ray  and  ratios ; the same propagation conditions are then applied to primary electrons .",
    "gamma - ray and synchrotron emission are then evaluated with the same model .",
    "our approach is not intended to perform detailed source abundance calculations with a large network of reactions , which is still best done with the path - length distribution approach ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "instead we use just the principal progenitors and weighted cross sections based on the observed cosmic - ray abundances ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the  data is used since it is the most accurately measured ratio covering a wide energy range and having well established cross sections .",
    "a re - evaluation of the halo size is desirable since new  data are available from ulysses with better statistics than previously .",
    "preliminary results were presented in strong & moskalenko ( 1997 ) ( hereafter @xcite ) and full results for protons , helium , positrons , and electrons in moskalenko & strong ( 1998a ) ( hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "evaluation of the  and  ratios , evaluation of diffusion / convection and reacceleration models , and setting of limits on the halo size , as well as full details of the numerical method and energy losses for nucleons and electrons are summarized in strong & moskalenko ( 1998 ) ( hereafter @xcite ) .",

    "for a recent discussion of diffuse galactic continuum and synchrotron emission in the context of this approach see strong , moskalenko , & reimer ( 1998 ) ( hereafter @xcite ) and moskalenko & strong ( 1998d ) .    for interested users",
    "our model is available in the public domain on the world wide web ( _ http://www.gamma.mpe-garching.mpg.de/@xmath1aws/aws.html _ )",
    "it was pointed out many years ago ( see @xcite , @xcite ) that the interpretation of radioactive cosmic - ray nuclei is model - dependent and in particular that halo models lead to a quite different physical picture from homogeneous models .",
    "the latter show simply a rather lower average matter density than the local galactic hydrogen ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but do not lead to a meaningful estimate of the size of the confinement region , and the correponding cosmic - ray ` lifetime ' is model - dependent . in such treatments",
    "the lifetime is combined with the grammage to yield an ` average density ' .",
    "for example lukasiak et al .",
    "( 1994a ) find an ` average density ' of 0.28 @xmath2 compared to the local interstellar value of about 1 @xmath2 , indicating a @xmath3-extent of less than 1 kpc compared to the several kpc found in diffusive halo models .",
    "our model includes spatial dimensions as a basic element , and so these issues are automatically addressed .",
    "the possible rle of convection was shown by jokipii ( 1976 ) , and jones ( 1979 ) pointed out its effect on the energy - dependence of the secondary / primary ratio .",
    "recent papers give estimates for the halo size and limits on convection based on existing calculations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , and we attempt to improve on these models with a more detailed treatment .",
    "previous approaches to the spatial nucleon propagation problem have been mainly analytical : jones ( 1979 ) , freedman et al .",

    "1990 ) , webber , lee , & gupta ( 1992 ) , bloemen et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and ptuskin & soutoul ( 1998 ) treated diffusion / convection models in this way .",
    "bloemen et al .",
    "( 1993 ) used the ` grammage ' formulation rather than the explicit isotope ratios , and their propagation equation implicitly assumes identical distributions of primary and secondary source functions .",
    "these papers did not attempt to fit the low - energy ( @xmath4 gev / nucleon )  data ( which we will show leads to problems ) and also did not consider reacceleration .",
    "it is clear than an analytical treatment quickly becomes limited as soon as more realistic models are desired , and this is the main justification for the numerical approach .",
    "the case of electrons and positrons is even more intractable analytically , although fairly general cases have been treated ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently porter & protheroe ( 1997 ) made use of a monte - carlo method for electrons , with propagation in the @xmath3-direction only .",
    "this method would be very time - consuming for 2- or 3-d cases .",
    "our method , using numerical solution of the propagation equation , is a practical alternative .",
    "reacceleration has previously been handled using leaky - box calculations ( @xcite ) ; this has the advantage of allowing a full reaction network to be used ( far beyond what is possible in the present approach ) , but suffers from the usual limitations of leaky - box models , especially concerning radioactive nuclei , which were not included in these treatments .",
    "our simplified reaction network is necessary because of the added spatial dimensions , but we believe it is fully sufficient for our purpose , since we are not attempting to derive a comprehensive isotopic composition",
    ". a more complex reaction scheme would not change our conclusions .",

    "since the introduction of a sharp break in @xmath19 is a contrived procedure which is adopted just to fit  at all energies , we also consider the case @xmath20 , i.e. no break , in order to investigate the possibility of reproducing the data in a physically simpler way .",
    "the convection velocity ( in @xmath3-direction only ) @xmath21 is assumed to increase linearly with distance from the plane ( @xmath22 for @xmath23 , @xmath24 for @xmath25 , and @xmath26 for all @xmath3 ) ; this implies a constant adiabatic energy loss .",
    "the linear form for @xmath21 is suggested by cosmic - ray driven mhd wind models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we include diffusive reacceleration since some stochastic reacceleration is inevitable , and it provides a natural mechanism to reproduce the energy dependence of the  ratio without an _ ad hoc _ form for the diffusion coefficient ( @xcite ) .",

    "we believe our new limits to be an improvement , first because of the improved be data from ulysses , second because of our treatment of energy losses ( see section  [ diff_reacc_models ] ) and generally more realistic astrophysical details in our model .",
    "recently , webber & soutoul ( 1998 ) , ptuskin & soutoul ( 1998 ) have obtained @xmath105 kpc and @xmath106 kpc , respectively , in agreement with our results .",
    "an important constraint on any model of cosmic - ray propagation is provided by data which give information on the radial distribution of cosmic rays in the galaxy . for a given source distribution",
    ", a large halo will give a smaller cosmic - ray gradient .",
    "it is generally believed that supernova remnants ( snr ) are the main sources of cosmic rays ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , but unfortunately the distribution of snr is poorly known due to selection effects .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to compare quantitatively the effects of halo size on the gradient for a plausible snr source distribution . for illustration",
    "we use the snr distribution from case & bhattacharya ( 1996 ) , which is peaked at @xmath107 kpc and has a steep falloff towards larger @xmath6 .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( left panel ) shows the effect of halo size on the resulting radial distribution of 3 gev cosmic - ray protons , for the reacceleration model . for comparison",
    "we show the cosmic - ray distribution deduced by model - fitting to egret data ( @xmath108 mev ) from strong & mattox ( 1996 ) , which is dominated by the @xmath42-decay component generated by gev nucleons ; the analysis by hunter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , based on a different approach , gives a similar result .",
    "the predicted cosmic - ray distribution using the snr source function is too steep even for large halo sizes ; in fact the halo size has a relatively small effect on the distribution .",
    "other related distributions such as pulsars ( @xcite , @xcite ) have an even steeper falloff . only for @xmath109 kpc",
    "does the gradient approach that observed , and in this case the combination of a large halo and a slightly less steep snr distribution could give a satisfactory fit . for diffusion / convection models",
    "the situation is similar , with more convection tending to make the gradient follow more closely the sources . a larger halo ( @xmath110 kpc ) ,",
    "apart from being excluded by the @xmath76be analysis presented here , would in fact not improve the situation much since fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows that the gradient approaches an asymptotic shape which hardly changes beyond a certain halo size .",
    "this is a consequence of the nature of the diffusive process , which even for an unlimited propagation region still retains the signature of the source distribution .",
    "based on these results we have to conclude , in the context of the present models , that the distribution of sources is not that expected from the ( highly uncertain : see @xcite ) distribution of snr .",
    "this conclusion is similar to that previously found by others ( @xcite ) . in view of the difficulty of deriving the snr distribution this is perhaps not a serious shortcoming",
    "; if snr are indeed cosmic - ray sources then it is possible that the analysis gives the best estimate of their galactic distribution .",
    "therefore in our standard model we have obtained the source distribution empirically by requiring consistency with the high energy results .",
    "alternatively it is possible that the diffusion is not isotropic but occurs preferentially in the radial direction , so smoothing the source distribution more effectively .",
    "this possibility will be addressed in future work .",

    "the positron and antiproton fluxes reflect the proton and helium spectra throughout the galaxy and thus provide an essential check on propagation models and also on the interpretation of diffuse emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "secondary positrons and antiprotrons in galactic cosmic rays are produced in collisions of cosmic - ray particles with interstellar matter .",
    "these are an important diagnostic for models of cosmic - ray propagation and provide information complementary to that provided by secondary nuclei . however , unlike secondary nuclei , antiprotons reflect primarily the propagation history of the protons , the main cosmic - ray component .    in our model the proton and helium spectra are computed as a function of @xmath5 by the propagation code .",
    "the injection spectrum is adjusted to give a good fit to the locally measured spectrum , normalizing at 10 gev / nucleon .    for the injection spectra of protons , we find @xmath111 reproduces the observed spectra in the case of no reacceleration , and @xmath112 with reacceleration .",
    "we find it is necessary to use slightly steeper ( 0.2 in the index ) injection spectra for helium nuclei in order to fit the observed spectra in the 1100 gev range of interest for positron production .",
    "the spectra fit up to about 100 gev beyond which the helium spectrum without reacceleration becomes too steep and the proton spectrum with reacceleration too flat ; these deviations are of no consequence for the positron and antiproton calculations .",

    "we thus consider the ` hard electron spectrum ' alternative .",
    "the electron injection spectral index is taken as 1.7 ( with reacceleration ) , which after propagation provides consistency with radio synchrotron data ( a crucial constraint ) . following pohl & esposito ( 1998 ) ,",
    "for this model we do _ not _ require consistency with the locally measured electron spectrum above 10 gev since the rapid energy losses cause a clumpy distribution so that this is not necessarily representative of the interstellar average .",
    "for this case , the interstellar electron spectrum deviates strongly from that locally measured as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . because of the increased ic contribution at high energies , the predicted spectrum can reproduce the overall intensity from 30 mev  10 gev but the detailed shape above 1 gev is still problematic .",
    "further refinement of this scenario is presented in @xcite .",
    "[ fig11 ] shows the model latitude and longitude distributions for the inner galaxy for 12 gev , convolved with the egret point - spread function , compared to egret phase 14 data ( with known point sources subtracted ) .",
    "it shows that a model with large ic component can indeed reproduce the data .",
    "the latitude distribution here is not as wide as at low energies owing to the rapid energy losses of the electrons , so that an observational distinction between a gas - related @xmath42-component from a hard nucleon spectrum and the ic model does not seem possible on the basis of @xmath0-rays alone , but requires also other tests such as consistency with antiproton and positron data ( see section  [ positrons_pbar ] ) .",
    "none of these models fits the spectrum below @xmath130 mev as measured by the compton gamma - ray observatory ( fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] left ) . in order to fit the low - energy part as diffuse emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] right ) , without violating synchrotron constraints ( @xcite ) , requires a rapid upturn in the cosmic - ray electron spectrum below 200 mev ( e.g. , as in fig .  [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "however , in view of the energetics problems ( @xcite ) , a population of unresolved sources seems more probable and would be the natural extension of the low energy plane emission seen by osse ( @xcite ) and ginga ( @xcite ) .",
    "our propagation model has been used to study several areas of high energy astrophysics .",
    "we believe that combining information from classical cosmic - ray studies with and other data leads to tighter constraints on cosmic - ray origin and propagation .",
    "we have shown that simple diffusion / convection models have difficulty in accounting for the observed form of the  ratio without special assumptions chosen to fit the data , and do not obviate the need for an _ ad hoc _ form for the diffusion coefficient .",
    "on the other hand we confirm the conclusion of other authors that models with reacceleration account naturally for the energy dependence over the whole observed range .",
    "combining these results points rather strongly in favour of the reacceleration picture .",
    "we take advantage of the recent ulysses be measurements to obtain estimates of the halo size .",
    "our limits on the halo height are @xmath117 kpc .",
    "our new limits should be an improvement on previous estimates because of the more accurate be data , our treatment of energy losses , and the inclusion of more realistic astrophysical details ( such as , e.g. , the gas distribution ) in our model .",
    "the gradient of protons derived from is smaller than expected for snr sources , and we therefore adopt a flatter source distribution in order to meet the constraints .",
    "this may just reflect the uncertainty in the snr distribution .",
    "the positron and antiproton fluxes calculated are consistent with the most recent measurements .",
    "the @xmath113 data point above 3 gev and positron flux measurements seem to rule out the hypothesis that the local cosmic - ray nucleon spectrum differs significantly from the galactic average ( by implication adding support to the ` hard electron ' alternative ) , but confirmation of this conclusion must await more accurate antiproton data at high energies .",
    "gamma - ray data suggest that the interstellar electron spectrum is harder then that locally measured , but this remains to be confirmed by detailed study of the angular distribution .",
    "the low - energy galactic emission is difficult to explain as truly diffuse and a point source population seems more probable ."
