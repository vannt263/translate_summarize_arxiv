    "the birkhoff polytope , which we will denote as @xmath1 , has been extensively studied and generalized .",
    "it is defined as the convex hull of the @xmath2 permutation matrices as vectors in @xmath3 .",
    "many analogous polytopes have been studied which are subsets of @xmath1 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in contrast",
    ", we study a polytope containing @xmath1 .",
    "we begin with the following definitions .",
    "[ def : asm ] alternating sign matrices ( asms ) are square matrices with the following properties :    * entries @xmath4 * the entries in each row and column sum to 1 * nonzero entries in each row and column alternate in sign    @xmath5    @xmath6 [ fig : n3asm ]    the total number of @xmath2 alternating sign matrices is given by the expression @xmath7 mills , robbins , and rumsey conjectured this formula  @xcite , and then over a decade later doron zeilberger proved it  @xcite .",
    "shortly thereafter , kuperberg found a bijection between asms and the statistical physics model of square ice with domain wall boundary conditions ( which is very similar to the _ simple flow grids _ defined later in this paper ) , and gave a shorter proof using insights from physics  @xcite .",
    "for a detailed exposition of the conjecture and proof of the enumeration of asms , see  @xcite .",
    "see figure  [ fig : n3asm ] for the seven @xmath8 asms .",
    "the @xmath9th alternating sign matrix polytope , which we will denote as @xmath10 , is the convex hull in @xmath3 of the @xmath0 alternating sign matrices .    from definition  [ def : asm ]",
    "we see that permutation matrices are the alternating sign matrices whose entries are nonnegative .",
    "thus @xmath1 is contained in @xmath10 .",
    "the connection between permutation matrices and asms is much deeper than simply containment .",
    "there exists a partial ordering on alternating sign matrices that is a distributive lattice .",
    "this lattice contains as a subposet the bruhat order on the symmetric group , and in fact , it is the smallest lattice that does so ( i.e.  it is the macneille completion of the bruhat order )  @xcite .",
    "given this close relationship between permutations and asms it is natural to hope for theorems for @xmath10 analogous to those known for @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we find analogues for @xmath10 of the following theorems about the birkhoff polytope ( see the discussion in  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "* @xmath1 consists of the @xmath0 nonnegative doubly stochastic matrices ( square matrices with nonnegative real entries whose rows and columns sum to 1 ) . *",
    "the dimension of @xmath1 is @xmath11 .",
    "* @xmath1 has @xmath12 vertices .",
    "* @xmath1 has @xmath13 facets ( for @xmath14 ) where each facet is made up of all nonnegative doubly stochastic matrices with a 0 in a specified entry .",
    "* @xmath1 projects onto the permutohedron .",
    "* there exists a nice characterization of its face lattice in terms of elementary bipartite graphs  @xcite .",
    "as we shall see in theorem  [ thm : asmchasing ] , the row and column sums of every matrix in @xmath10 must equal 1 .",
    "thus the dimension of @xmath10 is @xmath11 because , just as for the birkhoff polytope , the last entry in each row and column is determined to be precisely what is needed to make that row or column sum equal 1 . in section  [ sec : properties ] we prove that @xmath10 has @xmath15 $ ] facets and its vertices are the alternating sign matrices .",
    "we also prove analogous theorems about the inequality description of @xmath10 ( section  [ sec : asm ] ) , the face lattice ( section  [ sec : facelattice ] ) , and the projection to the permutohedron ( section  [ sec : properties ] ) .",
    "see  @xcite for background and terminology on polytopes .",
    "the alternating sign matrix polytope was independently defined in  @xcite in which the authors also study the integer points in the @xmath16th dilate of @xmath10 calling them _ higher spin alternating sign matrices_.",
    "the main theorem about the birkhoff polytope is the theorem of birkhoff  @xcite and von  neumann  @xcite which says that the birkhoff polytope can be described not only as the convex hull of the permutation matrices but equivalently as the set of all nonnegative doubly stochastic matrices ( real square matrices with row and column sums equaling 1 whose entries are nonnegative ) .",
    "the inequality description of the alternating sign matrix polytope is similar to that of the birkhoff polytope .",
    "it consists of the subset of doubly stochastic matrices ( now allowed to have negative entries ) whose partial sums in each row and column are between 0 and 1 .",
    "the proof uses the idea of von neumann s proof of the inequality description of the birkhoff polytope  @xcite .",
    "note that in  @xcite behrend and knight approach the equivalence of the convex hull definition and the inequality description of @xmath10 in the opposite manner , defining the alternating sign matrix polytope in terms of inequalities and then proving that the vertices are the alternating sign matrices .",
    "[ thm : asmchasing ]    the convex hull of @xmath0 alternating sign matrices consists of all @xmath0 real matrices @xmath17 such that :    @xmath18    call the subset of @xmath3 given by the above inequalities @xmath19 .",
    "it is easy to check that the convex hull of the alternating sign matrices is contained in the set @xmath19 .",

    "we construct a circuit in @xmath34 such that the partial sum between adjacent matrix entries in the circuit be an inner .",

    "@xmath35    begin at the vertex to the left or above any inner partial sum ; if no such partial sum exists , then @xmath34 is an alternating sign matrix .",
    "then there exists an adjacent inner partial sum by ( [ eq : rcrel ] ) . by repeated application of ( [ eq : rcrel ] ) to each new inner partial sum , a path can then be formed by moving from entry to entry of @xmath34 along inner partial sums . since @xmath34 is of finite size and all the boundary partial sums are 0 or 1 ( i.e. non  inner )",
    ", the path eventually reaches an entry in the same row or column as a previous entry yielding a circuit in @xmath34 whose partial sums are all inner . using this circuit",
    "we can write @xmath34 as a convex combination of two matrices in @xmath19 , each with at least one more non  inner partial sum , in the following way .",
    "@xmath36    label the corner matrix entries in the circuit alternately ( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) . define @xmath39 where @xmath23 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are taken over respectively the row partial sums to the right of a ( @xmath38 ) corner along the circuit ,",
    "the row partial sums to the right of a ( @xmath37 ) corner , the column partial sums below a ( @xmath38 ) corner , and the column partial sums below a ( @xmath37 ) corner .",
    "subtract @xmath43 from the entries labeled ( @xmath38 ) and add @xmath43 to the entries labeled ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "subtracting and adding @xmath43 in this way preserves the row and column sums and keeps all the partial sums weakly between 0 and 1 ( satisfying ( [ eq : partialcolumnsum])([eq : sumagain2 ] ) ) , so the result is another matrix @xmath44 in @xmath19 with at least one more non  inner partial sum than @xmath34 .",
    "now give opposite labels to the corners in the circuit in @xmath34 and subtract and add another constant @xmath45 in a similar way to obtain another matrix @xmath46 in @xmath19 with at least one more non  inner partial sum than @xmath34 .",
    "then @xmath34 is a convex combination of @xmath44 and @xmath46 , namely @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , by repeatedly applying this procedure , @xmath34 can be written as a convex combination of alternating sign matrices ( i.e. matrices of @xmath19 with no inner partial sums ) .",
    "now that we can describe the alternating sign matrix polytope in terms of inequalities , let us use this inequality description to examine some of the properties of @xmath10 , namely , its facets , its vertices , and its projection to the permutohedron .    to make the proofs of the next two theorems more transparent",
    ", we introduce modified square ice configurations called _ simple flow grids _ which will be used more extensively in section  [ sec : facelattice ] . consider a directed graph with @xmath48 vertices : @xmath13 ` internal ' vertices @xmath49 and @xmath50 ` boundary ' vertices @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",

    ", there will be exactly one directed edge between each pair of neighboring internal vertices and also a directed edge from an internal vertex to each neighboring border vertex .",
    "vertices of @xmath61 corresponding to 1 s are sources and vertices corresponding to @xmath65 s are sinks .",
    "the directions of the rest of the edges in @xmath61 are determined by the placement of the 1 s and @xmath65 s , in that there is a series of directed edges emanating from the 1 s and continuing until they reach a sink or a border vertex .",
    "thus @xmath61 is a simple flow grid .",
    "also , given a simple flow grid we can easily find the corresponding asm by replacing all the sources with 1 s and all the sinks with @xmath65 s . thus simple flow grids are in one - to - one correspondence with asms ( see figure  [ fig:5by5grid ] ) .",

    "recall that for @xmath67 the birkhoff polytope has @xmath13 facets ( faces of dimension one less than the polytope itself ) .",
    "( @xmath68 is simply a line segment , so the number of facets equals the number of vertices which is 2 . )",
    "each facet of the birkhoff polytope consists of all nonnegative doubly stochastic matrices with a zero in a fixed entry , that is , where one of the defining inequalities is made into an equality .",
    "the analogous theorem for @xmath10 is the following .",
    "[ theorem : facets ] @xmath10 has @xmath15 $ ] facets , for @xmath67 .    note that the @xmath69 defining inequalities for @xmath70 given in ( [ eq : partialcolumnsum ] ) and ( [ eq : partialrowsum ] ) can be restated as @xmath71 @xmath72 for @xmath55 .",
    "we have rewritten the statement that the row and column partial sums from the left or top must be less than or equal to @xmath73 as the row and column partial sums from the right and bottom must be greater than or equal to @xmath74 . by counting these defining inequalities",
    ", one sees that there could be at most @xmath75 facets , each determined by making one of the above inequalities an equality .",
    "it is left to determine how many of these equalities determine a face of dimension less than @xmath76 .    by symmetry",
    "we can determine the number of facets coming from the inequalities @xmath77 for @xmath78 and then multiply by 4 . since the full row and column sums always equal @xmath73 , the equalities such as @xmath79 yield the empty face ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "also , @xmath81 is implied from the fact that @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the inequalities @xmath84 for all @xmath85 , i.e. the entries in the first column are nonnegative , imply that @xmath86 for @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) , thus each of these sets is a face of dimension less than @xmath76 , and similarly for @xmath89 for @xmath87 ( @xmath90 ) the partial sums of the last column .",

    ", we do not include @xmath96 in our count since @xmath96 is also an inequality of the form @xmath97 .",

    "recall that a directed edge in a simple flow grid @xmath61 represents a location in the corresponding asm @xmath60 where the partial sum equals 1 , thus a directed edge missing from @xmath61 represents a location in @xmath60 where the partial sum equals 0 .",
    "thus we can represent each of the @xmath101 facets of ( [ eq : faceteq ] ) as subgraphs of the complete flow grid @xmath58 from which a single directed edge has been removed : @xmath102 or @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",

    "thus each of the @xmath15 $ ] equalities gives rise to a unique facet .",
    "for @xmath67 , the number of facets of @xmath10 on which an asm @xmath60 lies is given by @xmath119    each @xmath74 around the border of @xmath60 represents one facet .",
    "thus the number of facets corresponding to border zeros of @xmath60 equals @xmath120 .",
    "then there are @xmath121 facets represented by directed edges pointing in the opposite directions to the directed edges in the @xmath122 interior array of @xmath61 .",
    "the sum of these numbers gives the above count .",
    "even though @xmath10 is defined as the convex hull of the asms , it requires some proof that each asm is actually an extreme point of @xmath10 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath10 are the @xmath0 alternating sign matrices .",
    "fix an @xmath0 asm @xmath60 . in order to show that @xmath60 is a vertex of @xmath10 , we need to find a hyperplane with @xmath60 on one side and all the other asms on the other side .",
    "then since @xmath10 is the convex hull of @xmath0 asms , @xmath60 would necessarily be a vertex .",
    "consider the simple flow grid corresponding to @xmath60 . in any simple flow grid",
    "there are , by definition , @xmath123 directed edges , where for each entry of the corresponding asm there is a directed edge whenever the partial sum in that direction up to that point equals 1 . since the total number of directed edges in a simple flow grid is fixed , @xmath60 is the only asm with all of those partial sums equaling 1 .",
    "thus the hyperplane where the sum of those partial sums equals @xmath124 will have @xmath60 on one side and all the other asms on the other .",
    "thus the @xmath0 asms are the vertices of @xmath10 .",
    "another interesting property of the asm polytope is its relationship to the permutohedron . for a vector @xmath125 with distinct entries , define the permutohedron @xmath126 as the convex hull of all vectors obtained by permuting the entries of @xmath127",

    "we assume @xmath206 and wish to show that @xmath207 .",
    "now @xmath170 is the elementary flow grid whose edge set is the union of the edge sets of @xmath208 and @xmath61 over all asms @xmath60 in @xmath209 .",
    "every vertex in a simple flow grid must have even indegree and even outdegree .",
    "therefore , if we wish to obtain @xmath61 from @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is an asm in @xmath205 , by reversing some directed edges , the number of directed edges reversed at each vertex must be even . thus taking the union of the directed edges of @xmath210 with the directed edges of @xmath61 forms one or more circuits of double directed edges , where at least one of the double directed edges is not in @xmath208 .",
    "therefore @xmath170 has at least one more doubly directed region than @xmath208 , so @xmath212 .",
    "then since @xmath213 equals the complete flow grid @xmath58 , we have that @xmath214 . therefore moving up the face lattice",
