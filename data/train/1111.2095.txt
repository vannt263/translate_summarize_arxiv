    "the period - luminosity ( p - l , also known as leavitt law ) relation for cepheid variables is important in modern astrophysics , as it is the first rung in the distance scale ladder .",
    "the p - l relations can also be used to constrain the theoretical pl relations based on stellar pulsation and evolution models .",
    "one important issue in the application of p - l relation in distance scale work is its universality  is the slope of p - l relation independent of metallicity ? in this work ,",
    "the multi - band p - l relations were derived for the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) cepheids , based on the latest release of ogle - iii ( the third phase of optical gravitational lensing experiment ) catalogs .",
    "large numbers ( @xmath2 ) of cepheids in the lmc and smc permit the determination of accurate p - l slopes , hence testing the universality of the p - l relation in low metallicity galaxies .",
    "periods and intensity mean magnitudes in @xmath0 bands were available from ogle - iii catalogs for @xmath3 lmc cepheids @xcite and @xmath4 smc cepheids @xcite .",
    "all of these cepheids are fundamental mode cepheids .",
    "smc cepheids with @xmath5 , however , were removed from the sample , as they followed different p - l relation @xcite .",
    "these cepheids were cross - matched to 2mass point source catalog .",
    "the random - phase @xmath6 photometry were converted to mean magnitudes using the prescription given in @xcite .",
    "the mid - infrared photometry were available from _ spitzer _ archival data ",
    "sage @xcite and sage - smc .",
    "zaritsky s extinction maps for lmc @xcite and smc @xcite were used for extinction corrections .",
    "in addition , the extinction - free p - l relation  the wesenheit function in the form of @xmath7 , was also derived .",
    "outliers presented in the p - l plane were removed using an iterative sigma clipping algorithm @xcite .",
    "additional period cuts need to be applied in certain bands , as the faint end ( hence shorter period ) of these p - l relations may be affected by incompleteness bias .",
    "llll band & lmc p - l slopes & smc p - l slopes & slope difference + @xmath8 & @xmath9 & @xmath10 & @xmath11 + @xmath12 & @xmath13 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 + @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 + @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath23 + @xmath24 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 & @xmath27 + @xmath28 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath31 + @xmath32 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 + @xmath36 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 & @xmath39 + @xmath40 & @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 + @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 +    comparison of the multi - band p - l slopes for these two metal poor galaxies are presented in table [ tab ] .",
    "note that the lmc p - l slopes have been published in @xcite . as can be seen from this table ,",
    "the p - l slopes are within @xmath1 in all bands between the lmc and smc cepheids .",
    "the @xmath44 band p - l slopes are almost identical , suggesting the extinction - free @xmath44 band p - l relation is a good choice for distance scale application .",
