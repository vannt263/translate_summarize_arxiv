    "it is important to point out the significance of the observer for a quantum mechanical description .",
    "in contrast to classical relativity , where the observer is simply an expression of the set of coordinates used to describe the physics , in quantum mechanics the bipartite nature of the theoretical description of experiments must be taken into account : in addition to the dynamical evolution of a quantum state , this description must also contain the reduction of the state ( either objectively or effectively , regardless of the preferred interpretation of quantum mechanics ) to the eigenstate of some operator upon preparation and measurement .",

    "however , recalling the above discussion of the role of the observer , it is important to keep in mind that the description in schwarzschild coordinates is that of an observer at infinite radial distance .",

    "<S> a recent analysis by pikovski et al .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nat . phys . </S>",
    "<S> 11 , 668 ( 2015 ) ] has triggered interest in the question of how to include relativistic corrections in the quantum dynamics governing many - particle systems in a gravitational field . </S>",
    "<S> here we show how the center - of - mass motion of a quantum system subject to gravity can be derived more rigorously , addressing the ambiguous definition of relativistic center - of - mass coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate that , contrary to the prediction by pikovski et al . , external forces play a crucial role in the relativistic coupling of internal and external degrees of freedom , resulting in a complete cancellation of the alleged coupling in earth - bound laboratories for systems supported against gravity by an external force . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the proposed decoherence effect is an effect of relative acceleration between quantum system and measurement device , rather than a universal effect in gravitational fields .    how does a quantum particle move in a gravitational field ? </S>",
    "<S> thus far , only the nonrelativistic case of a particle in a newtonian , homogeneous gravitational potential has been experimentally tested  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic description of the dynamics of interacting quantum particles , on the other hand , is believed to require quantum field theory  @xcite , since relativistic effects must include particle creation and annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> strictly speaking , general relativistic corrections to the evolution of quantum matter should , therefore , be described within the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime  @xcite .    nonetheless , it is instructive and of relevance for experiments  @xcite to discuss relativistic effects in terms of higher order corrections to the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation : a model applicable to quantum systems for which the number of particles is conserved , to good approximation . </S>",
    "<S> these corrections can , for instance , be obtained as higher orders in @xmath0 of the @xmath1 expansion for a classical klein - gordon field in curved spacetime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result , however , must be considered as a _ single particle _ </S>",
    "<S> evolution equation . </S>",
    "<S> a more difficult problem , within this scheme , is how to analyze a system of many interacting particles . </S>",
    "<S> this is a necessary step towards correctly understanding how relativistic corrections affect the motion of atoms or molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the first problem one faces , is how to define a center - of - mass wave - function and how to derive its dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to extend the one - particle dynamics to the center of mass ( c.m . ) of a composite system , simply replacing the one - particle rest mass @xmath2 by @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the sum of all rest masses and @xmath5 the internal hamiltonian to nonrelativistic order . </S>",
    "<S> one then obtains , up to order @xmath0 , a coupling of internal and c.m .  </S>",
    "<S> degrees of freedom proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the nonrelativistic c.m .  </S>",
    "<S> kinetic and gravitational potential energy , respectively . based on this coupling , decoherence of the c.m .  </S>",
    "<S> wave - function due to an external , homogeneous gravitational field was predicted by pikovski et  al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , followed by a vivid debate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one immediate question which , to date , has not been raised , is the compatibility of this scheme with the well - known problems in defining relativistic c.m.variables  : no definition exists in which the c.m .  is ( i ) uniformly moving in absence of external forces , ( ii ) positions and momenta obey the canonical commutation relations , and ( iii ) the c.m </S>",
    "<S> .  is frame independent  @xcite . a perturbative procedure to construct canonical c.m </S>",
    "<S> .  variables , in which the dynamics in flat spacetime take the single particle form , was presented by krajcik and foldy  @xcite .    in this letter , we show how to generalize this prescription to accelerated observers , or to a homogeneous gravitational field by virtue of the equivalence principle . thereby , a precise definition of the coordinates in which the alleged coupling of c.m .  and internal degrees of freedom holds can be given .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that , in this precise context , the c.m .  </S>",
    "<S> motion couples to the internal dynamics , both for a particle held at constant height in the gravitational potential as seen by a free falling observer and for a free falling particle as seen by an accelerated ( e.g. earth bound ) observer ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : summary]b , c ) . </S>",
    "<S> yet , no coupling of the c.m .  to </S>",
    "<S> the internal hamiltonian occurs in situations where both the particle and the observer are accelerated ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : summary]d ) . in this case , the decoherence effect for an accelerated observer , hovering at constant height in the gravitational field , is exactly canceled by the potential that is keeping the particle from falling . the decoherence effect reported by pikovski et  al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , therefore , is an effect of _ relative acceleration _ of particle and observer ( i.e. the experimental set - up ) , rather than a universal decoherence in the presence of a gravitational field .    ] </S>"
