    "+ we present here calculations of these ratios , from to , which could be applied directly for the first time to _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of the extra - solar collisional plasmas such as stellar coronae .",
    "these calculations have been done to apply an improved model to the density analysis of the _ letgs _ and _ rgs _ spectra of various late - type stars such as capella , procyon , and @xmath5  centauri ( e.g. , audard et al .",
    "2001 , ness et al .",
    "2001 , mewe et al .",
    "2001a ) and also to o stars such as zeta puppis ( kahn et al .",
    "our model is to be considered as an improvement of various previous calculations for solar plasmas such as done by e.g. , gabriel & jordan ( 1969 ) , mewe & schrijver ( 1978 ) , pradhan & shull ( 1981 ) , mewe et al .",

    "the calculations are based on recent work by porquet & dubau ( 2000 ) and by mewe et al .",
    "( 2001b ) . + in the next two sections",
    ", we introduce the plasma diagnostics and the atomic processes taken into account in the calculations . in sect .",
    "4 we discuss applications to different types of plasmas ( photo - ionized , collision - dominated , and transient plasmas ) .",
    "in the x - ray range , the three most intense lines of helium - like ions ( `` triplet '' ) are : the * resonance * line ( @xmath6 , also called @xmath7 : 1s@xmath8@xmath9  1s2p@xmath10 , ) , the * intercombination * lines ( @xmath11 , also called @xmath12 : 1s@xmath8@xmath13  1s2p@xmath14 ) and the * forbidden * line ( @xmath15 , also called * z * : 1s@xmath8@xmath16  1s2s@xmath17 ) . they correspond to transitions between the @xmath18=2 shell and the @xmath18=1 ground state shell ( see figure  1 ) . the energy of each line from ( z=6 ) to ( z=14 ) are reported in table  1 .",
    "+    as shown by gabriel & jordan ( 1969 ) , these ratios are sensitive to electron density and to the electron temperature : @xmath19 @xmath20    at low density , where the n=2 states are populated by electron excitation and then decay radiatively , the relative intensities of the three lines are independent of the density . above the _ critical density _ ) is defined as n@xmath21c@xmath22a : c being the rate coefficient for collisional excitation 2@xmath23s @xmath24 2@xmath25p , a being the radiative transition probability of 2@xmath23s @xmath24 1@xmath26s . ] , the level 2@xmath23s ( upper level of the _ forbidden _ line ) becomes to be depleted by collisions to the 2@xmath23p levels ( upper levels of the intercombination line ) .",
    "then , at increasing density , the intensity of the _ forbidden _ line strongly decreases while the intensity of the _ intercombination _ line increases , implying a lowering of the ratio @xmath27 over approximatively two decades of density ( see figure  8 in porquet & dubau 2000 ) .",
    "however caution should be taken for and since in case of an intense uv radiation field , the photo - excitation between the @xmath23s term and the @xmath23p term is not negligible and has the same effect on the _ forbidden _ line and on the _ intercombination _ line as the collisional coupling , and thus could mimic a high - density plasma .",
    "+ the ratio @xmath28 is sensitive to the electron temperature since the collisional excitation rates have not the same dependence with the temperature for the _ resonance _ line and the two other lines .",
    "+ finally , the relative intensity of the three lines could be used to determine the ionization processes which prevail in the plasma , i.e. photo - ionization and/or collisional ionization ( see porquet & dubau 2000 , and the references therein ) . in the case of a plasma dominated by photo - ionization and recombination , the _ forbidden _ line ( or the _ intercombination _ line at high density ) is much stronger than the _ resonance line _ ( hence @xmath29 ) , whereas in a plasma dominated by collisional ionization and excitation the _ resonance _ line is comparable or stronger than the two other ones ( @xmath30 ) ( see figure  11 in porquet & dubau 2000 ) .",

    "the rates for the collisional excitations and for the radiative and dielectronic recombinations are from the recent data from porquet & dubau ( 2000 ) , see also references therein . + the a@xmath31 for the _ forbidden _ line ( 2@xmath241 ) , and for the strongest component of the _ intercombination _ line ( 4@xmath241 ) are updated by their experimental values when available ( see mewe et al .",
    "2001b ) . + a strong radiation field could mimic a high - density plasma analogously to collisional coupling above the critical density .",
    "this effect can be important for and also for ( cf . also ness et al .",
    "2001 ) , but for higher - z ions this effect is usually negligible . for the formulae of the photo - excitation rates ,",
    "see mewe et al .",
    "( 2001b ) . + in some cases where the plasma column density is high , optical depth effects on the resonance line should be taken into account in the calculation of the ratio @xmath28 .",
    "determination of the ratio of the possibly optically thick resonance line to the optically thin forbidden line was already suggested by acton and brown ( 1978 ) as a diagnostic to investigate resonance scattering effects in the solar corona .",
    "resonant scattering could be important in plasmas such as the `` warm absorber '' in agns where the column density @xmath32 could be as high as 10@xmath3310@xmath34@xmath35 , and also in some cases in stellar coronae .",
    "+ moreover , the contributions of unresolved dielectronic satellite lines to the lines _ r _ and _ f _ for , and are taken into account .",
    "the warm absorber ( wa ) is a totally or a partially photo - ionized medium ( with or without an additional ionization process ) located in the central part of active galactic nuclei .",
    "it may be a warm or hot component of the `` broad line region '' and/or the `` narrow line region '' .",
    "the ionization processes that occur in the wa , are still not very well known . indeed , even though the wa is commonly thought to be a photo - ionized gas , an additional ionization process can not be ruled out ( porquet & dumont 1998 , porquet et al .",
    "1999 , nicastro et al .",
    "thus , in porquet & dubau ( 2000 ) , both types of plasmas have been taken into account : a `` purely photo - ionized plasma '' and a `` hybrid plasma '' which is a photo - ionized plasma with additional collisional ionization processes .",
    "porquet & dubau ( 2000 ) have calculated the ratios @xmath27 and @xmath28 for both types of plasmas ( see also the atomic data therein ) .",
    "+ recently , _",
    "chandra _ provides much better spectral observations of the wa in agns , which show clearly the presence of he - like emission lines . for ngc5548 ,",

    "+ improvements of these calculations for photo - ionization plasmas are in preparation , taking into account experimental values for the transition probabilities of the @xmath38 and the @xmath39 lines , and the effect of an external radiation field ( photo - excitation ) for and , as well as the contributions of unresolved dielectronic satellite lines to the @xmath40 and the @xmath39 line , which for a low - temperature plasma could not be negligible .",

    ". then on the basis of the derived temperatures and densities , typical loop length scales of the star can be estimated using the known loop scaling law derived by rosner et al .",

    "while this is sometimes indicative of high electron density , they have shown that in the case of @xmath41 puppis , it is instead caused by the intense radiation field of this star .",
    "this constraints the location of the x - ray emitting shocks relative to the star , since the emitted regions should be close enough in order that the uv radiation is not too much diluted .",
    "recently , line - rich , high - resolution x - ray spectra were obtained with the _ xmm - rgs _ on two bright supernova remnants ( snrs ) located in the small magellanic cloud , i.e. 1e 0102 - 72.3 ( rasmussen et al .",
    "2001 ) and n132d ( behar et al . 2001 ) .",
    "because these sources are expected to be in a highly transient ionizing state it is important to take into account the effects of non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) in the interpretation of the line ratios . in the currently publicly available utrecht spectral code spex 1.10 ( kaastra et al . 1996 )",
    "several nei snr models are incorporated with calculations of the he - like triplet lines from mewe et al .",
    "( 1985 ) which can be used as a first approximation to investigate the nei effects from an analysis of the well - resolved lines of e.g. , the triplets . in a later version of spex our new calculations will be implemented .",

    "these diagnostics are one of the keys for a better understanding of the solar - stellar connection : heating of the coronae , magnetic activity , etc .",
    "the applications of these diagnostics also allow to discriminate between a photo - ionized and a `` hybrid '' plasma in different types of agns .",
