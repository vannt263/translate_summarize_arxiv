    "in a thermodynamic cycle , a working fluid is driven by a sequence of control operations , e.g. , compressions and expansions through a moving piston , and temperature variations such that its initial state is restored after one period @xcite .",
    "the net effect of such a process thus consists in the transfer of heat and work between a set of controllers and reservoirs external to the system .",
    "this concept was originally designed to link the operation principle of macroscopic machines such as otto or diesel engines with the fundamental laws of thermodynamics . as a paramount result ,",
    "these efforts inter alia unveiled that the efficiency of any heat engine operating between two reservoirs of respectively constant temperature is bounded by the carnot value .    during the last decade , thermodynamic cycles have been implemented on increasingly smaller scales .",
    "particular landmarks of this development are mesoscopic heat engines , whose working substance consists of a single colloidal particle @xcite or a micrometer - sized mechanical spring @xcite .",
    "recently , a further milestone was achieved by crossing the border to the quantum realm in experiments realizing cyclic thermodynamic processes with objects like single electrons @xcite or atoms @xcite . in the light of this progress",
    ", the question emerges whether quantum effects might allow to overcome classical limitations such as the carnot bound @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is quite some evidence that the performance of thermal devices can , in principle , be enhanced by exploiting , for example , coherence effects @xcite , non - classical reservoirs @xcite or the properties of superconducting materials @xcite .",
    "these studies are , however , mainly restricted to specific models and did so far not reveal a universal mechanism that would allow cyclic energy converters to benefit from quantum phenomena .",
    "the theoretical description of quantum thermodynamic cycles faces two major challenges .",
    "first , the external control parameters are typically varied non - adiabatically .",
    "therefore , the state of the working fluid can not be described by an instantaneous gibbs - boltzmann distribution , an assumption inherent to conventional macroscopic thermodynamics .",
    "second , the degrees of freedom of the working substance are inevitably affected by both , thermal and quantum fluctuations , which must be consistently taken into account .    in this paper , we take a first step towards a general framework overcoming both of these obstacles . to this end ,",
    "we consider the generic setup of fig .  [ fig_engine ] ,",
    "i.e. , a small quantum system , which is weakly coupled to a set of thermal reservoirs with periodically time - dependent temperature and driven by multiple controllers altering its hamiltonian . building on the scheme originally proposed in @xcite , we develop a universal approach that describes the corresponding thermodynamic process in terms of time - independent affinities and cycle - averaged fluxes .",
    "focusing on mean values thereby allows us to avoid subtleties associated with the definitions of heat and work for single realizations @xcite . in borrowing a term first coined by kohn @xcite in the context of quantum systems interacting with strong laser - fields",
    ", we refer to this theory as periodic thermodynamics of open quantum systems .    in the linear response regime , where temperature and energy variations can be treated perturbatively ,",
    "a quantum thermodynamic cycle is fully determined by a set of time - independent kinetic coefficients .",
    "such quantities were first considered in @xcite for some specific models of brownian heat engines and later obtained on a more general level for classical stochastic systems with continuous @xcite and discrete states @xcite . here , we prove two universal properties of the quantum kinetic coefficients for open systems following a markovian time evolution .",
    "first , we derive a generalized reciprocity relation stemming from microreversibility .",
    "second , we establish a whole hierarchy of constraints , which explicitly account for coherences between unperturbed energy eigenstates and lie beyond the laws of classical thermodynamics .    for quantum heat engines operating under linear response conditions ,",
    "these relations imply strong restrictions showing that quantum coherence is generally detrimental to both , power and efficiency .",
    "in particular , the carnot bound can be reached only if the external driving protocol commutes with the unperturbed hamiltonian of the working substance , which then effectively behaves like a discrete classical system .",
    "as one of our key results , we can thus conclude that any thermal engine , whose performance is truly enhanced through quantum effects , must be equipped with components that are not covered by our general setup as for example non - equilibrium reservoirs or feedback mechanisms .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we begin with introducing our general framework in sec .",
    "[ secframework ] . in sec .",
    "[ secmarkovdyn ] we outline a set of requirements on the lindblad generator , which ensure the thermodynamic consistency of the corresponding time - evolution . using this dynamics",
    "we then focus on quantum kinetic coefficients in sec .",
    "[ secgkc ] .",
    "[ secqtm ] is devoted to the derivation of general bounds on the figures of performance of quantum heat engines .",
    "we work out an explicit example for such a device in sec.[secex ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "[ seccon ] .",
    "as illustrated in fig . [ fig_engine ] , we consider an open quantum system , which is mechanically driven by @xmath0 external controllers and attached to @xmath1 heat baths with respectively time - dependent temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 corresponds to the free hamiltonian , the dimensionless operator @xmath5 represents the driving exerted by the controller @xmath6 and the scalar energy @xmath7 quantifies the strength of this perturbation . for this set - up",
    ", the first law reads @xmath8 with dots indicating derivatives with respect to time throughout the paper . by expressing the internal energy @xmath9 in terms of the density matrix @xmath10 , which characterizes the state of the system ,",
    "we obtain the power extracted by the controller @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath11 furthermore , the total heat current absorbed from the environment becomes @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the trace operation from onwards .",
    "we note that does not lead to a microscopic expression for the individual heat current @xmath14 related to the reservoir @xmath15 .",
    "this indeterminacy arises because thermal perturbations can not be included in the total hamiltonian @xmath16 .",
    "taking them into account explicitly rather requires to specify the mechanism of energy exchange between system and each reservoir .    still , any dissipative dynamics must be consistent with the second law , which requires @xmath17 with @xmath18 denoting the total rate of entropy production .",
    "the first contribution showing up here corresponds to the change in the von neumann - entropy of the system @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes boltzmann s constant .",
    "the second one accounts for the entropy production in the environment .",
    "we now focus on the situation , where the hamiltonian @xmath16 and the temperatures @xmath2 are @xmath21-periodic in time . after a certain relaxation time",
    ", the density matrix of the system will then settle to a periodic limit cycle @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , after averaging over one period , becomes @xmath23 i.e. , no net entropy is produced in the system during a full operation cycle .",
    "the entropy production in the environment can be attributed to the individual controllers and reservoirs by parametrizing the time - dependent temperatures as @xcite @xmath24 here , @xmath25 denotes the reference temperature , @xmath26 is the maximum temperature reached by the reservoir @xmath15 and the @xmath27 are dimensionless functions of time . inserting , and into yields @xmath28 with generalized affinities @xmath29 and generalized fluxes @xmath30 expression , which constitutes our first main result , resembles the generic form of the total rate of entropy production known from conventional irreversible thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "it shows that the mean entropy , which must be generated to maintain a periodic limit cycle in an open quantum system , can be expressed as a bilinear form of properly chosen fluxes and affinities .",
    "each pair thereby corresponds to a certain source of mechanical or thermal driving .",
    "a particular advantage of our approach is that it allows a systematic analysis of the linear - response regime , which is defined by the temporal gradients @xmath31 and @xmath7 being small compared to their respective reference values @xmath32 and @xmath33 here , @xmath34/z^0\\ ] ] denotes the equilibrium state of the system and @xmath35 the canonical partition function .",
    "the generalized fluxes and then become @xmath36 where @xmath37 the combined indices @xmath38 allow a compact notation .",
    "the generalized kinetic coefficients @xmath39 introduced in are conveniently arranged in a matrix @xmath40 with @xmath41 inserting into shows that , in the linear response regime , the mean entropy production per operation cycle becomes @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "consequently , the second law @xmath44 implies that the symmetric part @xmath45 of the matrix @xmath46 must be positive semi - definite .",
    "so far , we have introduced a universal framework for the thermodynamic description of periodically driven open quantum systems .",
    "we will now apply this scheme to systems , whose time - evolution is governed by the markovian quantum master equation @xcite @xmath47 with generator @xmath48 here , the super - operator @xmath49\\ ] ] describes the unitary dynamics of the bare system , where @xmath50 $ ] indicates the usual commutator and @xmath51 denotes planck s constant .",

    "the time - evolution generated by can be shown to preserve trace and complete positivity of the density matrix @xmath10 @xcite . furthermore , after a certain relaxation time , it leads to a periodic limit cycle @xmath55 for any initial condition @xcite . for later purpose ,",

    "[ secsecondlaw ] , we show that , if the reservoirs are considered as mutually independent , is also a necessary condition for to hold .    after specifying the dissipative dynamics of the system , the expressions for the generalized fluxes and can be made more explicit .",
    "first , integrating by parts with respect to @xmath68 in and then eliminating @xmath69 using yields @xmath70 the corresponding boundary terms vanish , since @xmath5 and @xmath71 are @xmath21-periodic in @xmath68 .",
    "second , by plugging into , we obtain the microscopic expression @xmath72 for the generalized heat flux extracted from the reservoir @xmath15 .    as a second criterion for thermodynamic consistency ,",
    "we require that the unperturbed dissipation super - operators @xmath73 fulfill the quantum detailed balance relation @xcite @xmath74 this condition ensures that , in equilibrium , the net rate of transitions between each individual pair of unperturbed energy eigenstates is zero .",
    "note that , in , @xmath64 acts on the operator exponential , while must be read as an identity between super - operators .",
    "furthermore , throughout this paper , the adjoint of super - operators is indicated by a dagger and understood with respect to the hilbert - schmidt scalar product @xcite , i.e. , for example @xmath75 + [ v^{\\sigma\\dagger}_\\nu,\\bullet]v^\\sigma_\\nu\\right).\\ ] ]    for systems , which can be described on a finite - dimensional hilbert space , implies that the super - operator @xmath76 can be written in the natural form @xcite @xmath77 +       [ v^{\\sigma\\dagger}_\\nu,\\bullet v^\\sigma_\\nu]\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace*{2.5 cm }       + \\bar{\\gamma}^\\sigma_\\nu \\left([v^\\sigma_\\nu\\bullet , v^{\\sigma\\dagger}_\\nu]+       [ v^\\sigma_\\nu,\\bullet v^{\\sigma\\dagger}_\\nu]\\right ) \\quad\\text{with}\\nonumber\\\\[9pt ] & \\bar{\\gamma}^\\sigma_\\nu\\equiv \\gamma^\\sigma_\\nu\\exp[-\\varepsilon^\\sigma_\\nu/({k_{{{\\rm b}}}}{t^{{{\\rm c } } } } ) ] , \\quad \\gamma^\\sigma_\\nu>0 , \\nonumber\\\\[9pt ] & [ h^0,v^\\sigma_\\nu ] = \\varepsilon^\\sigma_\\nu v^\\sigma_\\nu ,   \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\varepsilon^\\sigma_\\nu\\geq 0 .   \\label{apxgkcpropunpert1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] conversely , however , these conditions imply even if the dimension of the underlying hilbert space is infinite .",
    "therefore , the results of the subsequent sections , which rely on both , and , are not restricted to systems with a finite spectrum .",
    "they rather apply whenever the unperturbed dissipation super - operators @xmath73 have the form as , for example , in the standard description of the dissipative harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of the generator @xmath61 discussed in this section form the basis for our subsequent analysis . although they are justified by phenomenological arguments involving the second law and the principle of microreversibility , it is worth noting that most of these properties can be derived from first principles . specifically , and have been shown to emerge naturally from a general microscopic model for a time - independent open system in the weak - coupling limit @xcite . moreover , for a single reservoir of constant temperature , the time - dependent relation has been derived using a similar method under the additional assumption that the time - evolution of the bare driven system is slow on the time - scale of the reservoirs @xcite . in the opposite limit of fast driving , this microscopic approach can be combined with floquet theory to obtain an essentially different type of lindblad - generator @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic interpretation of the corresponding time - evolution is , however , not yet settled .",
    "the question how a thermodynamically consistent master equation for a general set - up involving a driven system , multiple reservoirs and time - dependent temperatures can be derived from first principles is still open at this point .",
    "solving the master equation within a first order perturbation theory and exploiting the properties of the generator @xmath61 discussed in the previous section leads to explicit expressions for the generalized kinetic coefficients . for convenience , we relegate this procedure to the first part of appendix [ apxgkc ] and present here only the result    @xmath78    where @xmath79 denotes the kronecker symbol , @xmath5 was defined in , @xmath80 and @xmath81 furthermore , we introduced the scalar product @xcite @xmath82\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the space of operators .",
    "the two parts of the coefficients @xmath39 showing up in can be interpreted as follows .",
    "first , the modulation of the hamiltonian and the temperatures of the reservoirs leads to non - vanishing generalized fluxes @xmath83 and @xmath84 even before the system has time to adapt to these perturbations .",
    "this effect is captured by the instantaneous coefficients @xmath85 .",
    "second , in responding to the external driving , the state of the system deviates from thermal equilibrium thus giving rise to the retarded coefficients @xmath86 .",
    "we note that the expressions do not involve the full generator @xmath61 but only the unperturbed super - operators @xmath73 and @xmath87 .",
    "this observation confirms the general principle that linear response coefficients are fully determined by the free dynamics of the system and the small perturbations disturbing it @xcite .",
    "compared to the kinetic coefficients recently obtained for periodically driven classical systems @xcite , the expressions are substantially more involved .",
    "this additional complexity is , however , not due to quantum effects but rather stems from the presence of multiple reservoirs , which has not been considered in the previous studies . indeed , as we show in the second part of appendix [ apxgkc ] , if only a single reservoir is attached to the system , simplifies to @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "the deviations of the external perturbations from equilibrium are thereby defined as @xmath90 where dots indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath68 and @xmath91 denotes the unity operator .",
    "expression has precisely the same structure as its classical analogue with the only difference that the scalar product had to be modified according to in oder to account for the non - commuting nature of quantum observables .",
    "as in the classical case , the single - reservoir coefficients can be split into an adiabatic part @xmath92 , which persists even for infinitely slow driving , and a dynamical one @xmath93 containing finite - time corrections .",
    "this partitioning , which was originally suggested in @xcite , is , however , not equivalent to the division into instantaneous and retarded contributions introduced here .",
    "in fact , the later scheme is more general than the former one , which can not be applied when the system is coupled to more than one reservoir . in such set - ups , temperature gradients between distinct reservoirs typically prevent the existence of a universal adiabatic state , which , in the case of a single reservoir , is given by the instantaneous boltzmann distribution @xcite .      after deriving the explicit expressions for the generalized kinetic coefficients , we will now explore the interrelations between these quantities .",
    "to this end , we first have to discuss the principle of microscopic reversibility or @xmath94-symmetry @xcite .",
    "a closed and autonomous , i.e. , undriven , quantum system is said to be @xmath94-symmetric if its hamiltonian commutes with the anti - unitary time - reversal operator @xmath94 @xcite . in generalizing this concept , here we call an open , autonomous system @xmath94-symmetric if the generator @xmath95 governing its time - evolution fulfills @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the stationary state associated with @xmath95 . this definition is motivated by the fact that , within the weak - coupling approach , arises from the @xmath94-symmetry of the total system including the reservoirs and their coupling to the system proper @xcite .",
    "note that , here , we assume the absence of external magnetic fields .",
    "the condition was first derived by agarwal in order to extend the classical notion of detailed balance to the quantum realm @xcite . in the same spirit",
    ", kossakowski obtained the relation and the structure without reference to time - reversal symmetry . provided that @xmath95 has the lindblad form",
    ", the condition is indeed less restrictive than .",
    "in fact , follows from and under the additional requirement that @xcite @xmath99    microreversibility implies an important property of the generalized kinetic coefficients .",
    "specifically , if the free hamiltonian @xmath4 and the free lindblad operators @xmath100 defined in satisfy , i.e. , if the unperturbed system is @xmath94-symmetric , we have the reciprocity relations @xmath101   = l_{\\beta\\alpha } [ { \\mathsf{t}}g_\\alpha(-t),{\\mathsf{t}}g_\\beta ( -t)].\\ ] ] here , the @xmath39 are regarded as functionals of the perturbations @xmath102 . the symmetry , which we prove in appendix [ apxrr ] , constitutes the analogue of the well - established onsager - relations @xcite for periodically driven open quantum systems .",
    "its classical counterpart was recently derived in @xcite for a single reservoir and one external controller .",
    "extensions to classical set - ups with multiple controllers were subsequently obtained in @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath103 defined in are invariant under the action @xmath104 by virtue of .",
    "thus , if the modulations of the hamiltonian fulfill @xmath105 , reduces to @xmath106   = l_{\\beta\\alpha } [ g_\\alpha(-t),g_\\beta ( -t)].\\ ] ] furthermore , if the @xmath5 can be written in the form @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 , the special symmetry @xmath110 = l_{\\beta\\alpha } [ \\gamma_\\beta(t ) , \\gamma_\\alpha(t)]\\ ] ] holds , which , in contrast to and , does not involve the reversed protocols ( see appendix [ apxrr ] for details ) .      we will now explore to what extend the kinetic coefficients show signatures of quantum coherence .",
    "to this end , we assume for simplicity that the spectrum of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath4 is non - degenerate .",
    "a quasi - classical system is then defined by the condition @xmath111 = 0 \\quad\\text{for}\\quad j=1,\\dots , n_w,\\ ] ] which entails that , up to second - order corrections in @xmath7 and @xmath112 , the periodic state @xmath71 is diagonal in the joint eigenbasis of @xmath4 and the perturbations @xmath5 at any time @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the corresponding kinetic coefficients effectively describe a discrete classical system with periodically modulated energy levels given by the eigenvalues of the full hamiltonian @xmath16 .",
    "this result , which is ultimately a consequence of the detailed balance structure , is proven in the first part of appendix  [ apxqcs ] , where we also provide explicit expressions for the quasi - classical kinetic coefficients @xmath113 .    for a systematic analysis of the general case , where does not hold , we divide the perturbations @xmath114 into a classical part @xmath115 satisfying and a coherent part @xmath116 , which is purely non - diagonal in the unperturbed energy - eigenstates . by inserting this decomposition into and exploiting the properties of the super - operators @xmath117 arising from , we find @xmath118 where the coefficients @xmath113 and @xmath119 are obtained by replacing @xmath5 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the definitions , respectively .",
    "this additive structure follows from a general argument , which we provide in the second part of appendix  [ apxqcs ] .",
    "it reveals two important features of the kinetic coefficients .",
    "first , the coefficients @xmath120 interrelating the perturbations applied by different controllers decay into the quasi - classical part @xmath121 and a quantum correction @xmath122 .",
    "the latter contribution is thereby independent of the classical perturbations @xmath123 and accounts for coherences between different eigenstates of @xmath4 .",
    "second , the remaining coefficients are unaffected by the coherent perturbations @xmath124 and thus , in general , constitute quasi - classical quantities .",
    "the reciprocity relations establish a link between the kinetic coefficients describing a certain thermodynamic cycle and those corresponding to its time - reversed counterpart .",
    "for an individual process determined by fixed driving protocols @xmath125 , these relations do , however , not provide any constraints .",
    "still , the kinetic coefficients are subject to a set of bounds , which do not involve the reversed protocols and can be conveniently summarized in form of the three conditions @xmath126 where @xmath127 here , we used the block matrices @xmath128 introduced in , the diagonal matrix @xmath129 with entries defined in and the quasi - classical kinetic coefficients @xmath130 introduced in .",
    "furthermore the notation @xmath131 indicates that the matrices @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 are positive semidefinite .",
    "the proof of this property , which we give in appendix [ apxnc ] , does not involve the @xmath94-symmetry relation but rather relies only on the condition , the detailed balance relation and the corresponding structure of the lindblad - generator .",
    "we note that , in the classical realm , where @xmath135 , reduces to the single condition @xmath136 .",
    "the second law stipulates that the matrix @xmath45 defined in must be positive semidefinite . since @xmath45 is a principal submatrix of @xmath132 , this constraint",
    "is included in the first of the conditions , which thus explicitly confirms that our formalism is thermodynamically consistent . moreover , implies a whole hierarchy of constraints on the generalized kinetic coefficients beyond the second law .",
    "these bounds can be derived by taking successively larger principal submatrices of @xmath132 , @xmath133 or @xmath137 , which are not completely contained in @xmath45 , and demanding their determinant to be non - negative .",
    "for example , by considering the principal submatrix @xmath138 of @xmath133 we find @xmath139 analogously , the principal submatrix @xmath140 yields the particularly important relation @xmath141 the classical version of this constraint has been previously used to derive a universal bound on the power output of thermoelectric @xcite and cyclic brownian @xcite heat engines .",
    "as we will show in the next section , implies that cyclic quantum engines are subject to an even stronger bound .",
    "we derive the expressions for the generalized kinetic coefficients within three steps .",
    "first , by linearizing the components of the generator with respect to @xmath7 and @xmath112 , we obtain @xmath244 where we assume that @xmath64 depends on @xmath16 and @xmath2 but not on @xmath245 if @xmath246 .",

    "for the reciprocity relations , the even stronger @xmath94-symmetry condition is necessary . both , detailed balance and @xmath94-symmetry are quite natural and broadly accepted conditions , which ultimately rely on the reversibility of microscopic dynamics .",
    "it should , however , be noted that , at least from a phenomenological point of view , they constitute stronger requirements than the bare second law , which stipulates only the first of the above mentioned properties of the lindblad generator .    as a key application , our theory allows to obtain bounds on the maximum efficiency and power of quantum heat engines , which reveal that coherence effects are generally detrimental to both of these figures of merit .",
    "this insight has been illustrated quantitatively for a paradigmatic model consisting of a harmonically driven two - level system . in the quasi - classical limit ,",
    "where our new constraints on the kinetic coefficients become weakest , we recover a general bound on power , which is a quadratic function of efficiency .",

    "all of these approaches , however , rely on a markovian dynamics , which is further specified by a detailed balance condition .",
