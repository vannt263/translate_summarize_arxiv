    "the gum nebula , a prominent hii region of southern milky way , was discovered by ( gum 1952 ) .",
    "the whole nebula is around 36@xmath1 in diameter ( chanot & sivan 1983 ) . the true nature of the gum nebula is not very clear . along with the two o type stars @xmath0 pup and @xmath2 velorum , two ob associations , vela ob2 and tr 10 ,",
    "have been found in the gum nebula region .",
    "there are also two supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the direction of the gum nebula , pup a and vela snr .",
    "however , sridharan ( 1992 ) argued that the spatial coincidence of these two snrs with the gum nebula is due to chance superposition .",
    "chanot & sivan ( 1983 ) described the gum nebula as an intermediate structure between classical hii region and typical supernova remnant .",
    "about 30 cometary globules have been found in the gum nebula and they are distributed in a nearly circular pattern .",
    "they share common features of a compact , dusty head ( sometimes with a bright - rim ) , and a comet - like tail .",
    "the tails of the globules generally point radially outwards from the centre of the vela ob2 association .",
    "the axes of these cgs seem to converge on a very small area around at l@xmath3 261@xmath1 , b@xmath3 - 5@xmath1 reipurth ( 1983 ) , zealey et al . , ( 1983 ) .",
    "the source of the cg complex is as yet still unclear",
    ". a single source may not be responsible for the formation and the evolution of the gum nebula complex .",
    "@xmath0 pup , and @xmath2 velorum and the two ob associations are considered as the probable source of the uv radiation and photoionisation of the nebula in the literature .    there are some uncertainties about the distances of @xmath0 pup and @xmath2 velorum .",
    "the estimated hipparcos distance to the wolf - rayet wc8+o spectroscopic binary @xmath2 velorum is 258@xmath4 pc and to the o4i(n)f star @xmath0 pup it is 429@xmath5 pc ( van der hucht 1997 ) .",
    "however , pozzo ( 2000 ) argued that the distance to the @xmath2 velorum may be same as that for the vela ob2 association . again",
    "the estimated hipparcos distance to the vela ob2 association is 410 pc ( de zeeuw 1999 ) and woermann ( 2001 ) estimated a distance of 500 pc to the expansion centre of the association . in this context an average distance to the cg system as 450",
    "pc is reasonable as adopted by sridharan ( 1992 ) .",
    "there have been several studies on the kinematics of the gum nebula region to determine whether the system is expanding or not , yamaguchi ( 1999 ) and references therein .",
    "most of the studies concluded that the molecular material associated with the gum nebula is expanding though the expansion velocities obtained from various studies are different from each other .",
    "zealey ( 1983 ) and sridharan ( 1992 ) studied the kinematics of the cgs in details and based on the radial velocity measurements concluded that the cgs are expanding and obtained the expansion velocity of the system as 5 and 12 km s@xmath6 respectively .",
    "woerman ( 2001 ) investigated the kinematics of the neutral material around the gum nebula .",
    "they concluded that the diffuse molecular clouds ( dmcs ) and cometary globules(cgs ) form a single expanding shell centred on l@xmath3= 261@xmath1 , b@xmath3 = -2.5@xmath1 .",
    "according to their model the shell is asymmetric with the radii of the front and back faces as 130 and 70 pc respectively .",
    "they also obtained the expansion velocities of 14 and 8.5 km @xmath7 for front and back faces respectively .",
    "they suggested the supernova explosion of the companion of @xmath0 pup about 1.5 myr ago as the probable origin of the gum nebula and the expanding shell .",
    "there have been no studies of the transverse ( in the plane of the sky ) motion of the gum nebula and the associated cgs . in this paper",
    "we have examined the proper motion measurements of stellar and young stellar objects ( ysos ) in this region to study the expansion of the system of cgs and possible sources responsible for the triggered star formation in the cgs of gum nebula . in section 2 . and 3 .",
    "we summarise the characteristics of the cgs in the gum nebula as well as the known ysos in and around the cgs .",
    "we discuss the proper motions of the ysos in section 4 .",
    "results are discussed in section 5 . and conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "zealey ( 1983 ) carried out an extensive study of the cometary globules in the gum nebula region .",
    "they found 29 cgs within a region of projected angular radius of 9.5@xmath1 .",
    "they tabulated the coordinates , position angles , tail directions and measured h@xmath8co radial velocities of some of the cgs .",
    "they proposed the approximate centre of the cg complex based on the best fitting circle of the cg positions .",
    "sridharan ( 1992 ) found some discrepancies in the coordinates of the cgs and redefined the coordinates of the individual cgs .",
    "sridharan ( 1992 ) studied the kinematics of the cometary globules in the gum nebula using the transition lines of @xmath9 and tabulated the v@xmath10 velocities of most of the cgs .",
    "we have adopted positions and velocities from sridharan ( 1992 ) and the approximate centre of the system from zealey ( 1983 ) .",
    "reipurth ( 1983 ) suggested that the cgs are pointed towards the triangle formed by @xmath0 puppis , @xmath2 velorum and vela pulsar and estimated an average projected distance of 70 pc for the cgs from the centre of the triangle .",
    "it is possible that the two o type stars and the progenitor of the vela pulsar were the main energy source of the whole gum nebula region in the past . in figure [ cg-l-b.ps ] we have plotted the respective cgs , members of the vela ob2 association and the young stellar objects(ysos ) around the cgs in the galactic coordinates together with the the probable energy sources @xmath2 velorum and @xmath0 pup .",
    "the adopted centre of the nebula from zealey ( 1983 ) is also plotted .",
    "the vectors associated with the cgs in the plot have lengths proportional to the tail - lengths of the cgs and also indicate their directions .",
    "various authors derived the centre of expansion of the cg complex , , zealey ( 1983 ) , reipurth ( 1983 ) and sridharan ( 1992 ) . in this paper",
    "we have adopted the position of the centre as suggested by zealey ( 1983 ) ra(2000)=08@xmath1119@xmath1240.54@xmath13 dec(2000)=-44@xmath109@xmath1430.8@xmath15 ( l261.10@xmath1 , b -4.46@xmath1 ) which is in good agreement with the centre coordinate ( l 261.5@xmath1 , b-4.0@xmath1 ) obtained by woerman ( 2001 ) .",
    "we have also adopted the approximate centre of the vela ob2 association as ra(2000)=08@xmath1107@xmath1200.22@xmath13 dec(2000)=-46@xmath141@xmath1453.8@xmath15 ( l262.3@xmath1 , b-7.71@xmath1 ) .",
    "reipurth ( 1983 ) proposed a mechanism for the formation and evolution of the cgs based on the interaction of the massive stars and their parent molecular cloud .",
    "brand ( 1983 ) proposed that the cometary morphology has been created by the passing of shock wave through a spherical molecular cloud .",
    "they also suggested the possibility of star formation in the shocked molecular clouds .",
    "analytical models ( also known as the radiation driven implosion ( rdi ) models ) have been developed by bertoldi ( 1989 ) and bertoldi & mckee ( 1990 ) .",
    "lefloch & lazareff ( 1994 ) studied the evolution and morphology of the cometary globules by a 2-d hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "these models could not reproduce the details of triggered star formation by the uv radiation because they did not include the effect of self gravity .",
    "miao ( 2006 ) have shown the evolution of the cometary globules as well as the triggered star formation under the influence of the uv radiation of the massive stars by a 3-d smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulation .    according to these models , when an ob association forms in a comparatively dense core of a clumpy giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) its interaction with its parent molecular cloud can be destructive or constructive depending on the size and density distribution of the leftover clumps and cores of the parent gmc . the uv radiation from the massive young stars evaporates the gas and less dense material in its surroundings and creates an expanding strmgren sphere .",
    "but it can not evaporate the relatively dense cores of the clumpy parent cloud because of the recombination shielding of the front layer known as the ionised boundary layer [ ibl ] ( elmegreen 1976 ) .",
    "however , the ionised gas starts to move towards the ionising source and due to momentum conservation the clumps also get a velocity radially outward from the central star .",
    "this mechanism is known as rocket effect ( oort @xmath16 spitzer 1950 ) .",
    "the rocket effect pushes the loosely bound gaseous envelope much more effectively than the dense core .",
    "the expanding strmgren sphere also creates a shock wave which interacts with the leftover remnant clumps and converts them into more dense regions . as a result a newly exposed dense core generally has a thin ionized layer and a tail in the opposite direction created by the leftover material of the parent gmc . at the same time",
    "the compression by the shock front can trigger the next generation star formation in the dense core .",
    "it thus provides the additional external pressure force to the gravity to collapse the clumps to form stars .",
    "this process of star formation is known as triggered star formation as opposed to the spontaneous star formation where only gravity is responsible for the collapse of the cloud core .",
    "also the low mass stars which have formed in these globules simultaneously with the massive stars are exposed to photoevaporation .",
    "considerable evidence for current low mass star formation in the cometary globules of the gum nebula is discussed in the following section .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic studies to investigate the low mass star formation in the cometary globules have been undertaken by petterson ( 1987 ) , sahu ( 1992 ) , reipurth ( 1983 , 1993 ) , kim ( 2005 ) .",
    "based on h@xmath17 emission line , li absorption line and near ir infrared excesses , 30 ysos have been identified in the direction of the gum nebula .",
    "there are confirmed signatures of the low mass star formation in the globules ; cg 1(reipurth , 1983 ) , cg 22 [ sahu ( 1992 ) , reipurth ( 1983 , 1993 ) ] , cg 30/31/38 complex [ reipurth ( 1983 ) , petterson ( 1987 ) , kim ( 2005 ) ] , cg 4/cg 6/sa101 and cg 13 ( reipurth , 1993 ) .",
    "we have tabulate the optical and near ir photometric measurements of the individual ysos in the table [ spec_phot_data ] .",
    "we also include the spectral types and the measured h@xmath17 equivalent widths in the table [ spec_phot_data ] . near ir magnitudes are taken from the 2mass point source catalog ( cutri , 2003 ) . except for nx pup which is of spectral type a , the other ysos found near the cgs are all late type stars with spectral types f , k and m. we also tabulate some useful parameters related to the known star forming cgs and dark clouds in table [ cloud_param ] .    petterson ( 1987 ) made photometric , spectroscopic and infrared observations of 16 h@xmath17 emission line stars in the region near the cometary globules cg 30/31/38 .",
    "they identified 9 t tauri stars .",
    "they also found that except pha 12 and pha 44 all other spectroscopically confirmed ysos are variable in v band .",
    "pha 41 has shown optical variability of 3 mag . and",
    "pha 15 , pha 21 , pha 34 , pha 41 have large ( u - b ) excesses .",
    "petterson & reipurth ( 1993 ) surveyed five fields in the gum nebula for low mass emission line stars .",
    "they found 7 h@xmath17 emission line stars near the cg4/cg6/sa 101 cloud complex and one more near cg 13 .",
    "they confirmed the nature of the objects as the low - mass young stars [ rp93 ] based on the low resolution spectra , optical and near ir photometry .",
    "kim ( 2005 ) presented photometric and spectroscopic observations of low mass pre - main sequence stars in the cometary globules cg 30/31/38 .",
    "they identified pms stars in that direction by photometric and spectroscopic studies .",
    "they confirmed the youth of the pms stars using the lithium abundances .",
    "they also measured the radial velocities of the pms stars which are consistent with those of the cometary globules .",
    "kim ( 2005 ) also suggested that xrs 9 , kww 1055 , kww 1125 , kww 1333 and kww 1806 are probably old field stars ( 50 - 100 myr ) with strong magnetic activity .",
    "we do not consider these objects in further discussion .",

    "<S> in particular the kinematics of two ysos embedded in cgs is inconsistent with the supernova explosion of the companion of @xmath0 pup about 1.5 myr ago as the cause of the expansion of the cg system . </S>",
