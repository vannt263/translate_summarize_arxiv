    "since long , galactic rotation curves indicate the existence of non - radiating dark matter . this evidence has been hardened also by evidences on larger cosmic scales , ending up with the largest scales , surveyed with the help of the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "in particular , the data suggest a dominant contribution of non - baryonic , non - relativistic ( cold ) dark matter . among the favoured dm",
    "candidates are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , in particular neutralinos as the lightest particles in many minimal supersymmetric models .",
    "one strategy to search for a neutralino signal is to search for neutrinos produced in annihilation processes inside a large gravitational mass like the sun .",
    "this method is well established since the nineties using underground and underwater(ice ) neutrino telescopes .",
    "the baikal neutrino experiment has published results of a search for neutrinos from wimp annihilations in the core of the earth @xcite , while the analysis with respect to the sun is now presented the first time .",
    "we are looking for high energy neutrinos from the sun in excess of the expected atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the analysis is based on data taken with the nt200 neutrino telescope between april 1998 and february 2003 .",
    "located in lake baikal , south - east siberia , the neutrino telescope nt200 is operated underwater at a depth of since 1998 .",
    "the telescope detects cherenkov light from upward and downward - going relativistic muons .",
    "nt200 consists of 192 optical modules ( oms ) arranged pair - wise on 8 strings , with 12 pairs per string .",
    "the height of the detector is 72 m , its diameter is 42 m .",
    "each om contains a 37-cm photomultiplier tube ( _ pmt _ ) . to suppress background from bioluminescence and dark noise , the two pmts of a pair",
    "are switched in coincidence . since 2005",
    ", the nt200 configuration was upgraded by additional 3 strings , each 100 m away from the center . this upgraded detector of about 10 mton ( named nt200 + ) serves as a prototype cell for a later gigaton volume detector .",
    "the status of the baikal neutrino telescope is presented at this conference @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed nt200 data collected between april , 1998 and february , 2003 , with a total of 1007 live days .",
    "calibration methods and methods to reconstruct muon tracks have been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "our analysis is based on data taken with the _",
    "muon trigger_. it requires within , where _ hit _ refers to a pair of oms coupled in a _",
    "channel_. typically is set to .",
    "the detector response to atmospheric neutrinos and muons has been obtained with monte carlo simulations based on standard codes like ` corsika ` @xcite and ` mum ` @xcite , the bartol atmospheric @xmath0 flux @xcite and the neutrino cross - sections from @xcite .    the offline filter which requires at least 6 hits on at least 3 strings ( `` 6/3 '' ) selects about @xmath1 of all triggered events . to distinguish upward and downward going muons on a one - per - million mis - assignment level ,",
    "a filter with several levels of quality cuts was developed for the atmospheric neutrino ( @xmath2 ) analysis @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric muons which have been mis - reconstructed as upward - going particles are the main source of background in a search for neutrino induced upward - going muons . to get the best possible estimator for the direction , we use multiple start guesses for the @xmath3 minimization . for the final choice of the local minimum of @xmath3 we use quality parameters which are not related to the time information . at the offline filter level",
    "( `` 6/3 '' ) the angular resolution ( @xmath4 - r.m.s .",
    "mismatch angle ) is about @xmath5 for the @xmath2-sample .",
    "the present analysis defines two samples - sample a and sample b - which are optimized for the low and high wimp - mass region , respectively .",
    "they use further differently tight quality cuts , resulting in different background contaminations and sligthly different angular resolution .",
    "the quality cuts are applied to variables like the number of hit channels , the probability of fired channels to have been hit or not , the actual position of the track with respect to the detector centre and @xmath6 . to improve the signal - to - background ratio we used only events with reconstructed zenith angle @xmath7",
    "this results in 2376 and 510 upward going muons for sample a and b , respectively ( with @xmath2-angular resolutions @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "both @xmath4 values are much bigger than the visible size of the sun .",
    "however the angular window for a signal search may be even larger , since at least at energies below 100 gev the kinematical angle between neutrino and muon dominates .",
    "a map of the ecliptic plane centered at the sun is shown in fig.[sursun510 ] with 510 upward going muons .",
    "no clustering toward the sun is observed .",
    "the distribution of the correlation angles between muons and the sun is shown in fig.[csnsunmu2376_945 ] .",
    "the dots refer to angles with the real position of the sun , the histogram to angles with `` fake suns '' , defining the expected background behaviour .",
    "no excess is observed , resulting in upper limits on number of muons from the sun .",
    "table i gives the upper limits at @xmath10 confidence level ( c.l . ) for the two selected data samples .",
    "we give numbers for three values of the half cone to the sun which are used in the dark matter analysis .",
    "to obtain upper limits on the muon numbers we used the recipes for low statistics given in the pdg @xcite and well as the feldman - cousins method @xcite ( numbers for fc in parentheses ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "to derive limits on neutrino and muon fluxes one needs the effective area of the detector .",
    "fig.[areaneutrinocuts ] shows the nt200 area for neutrinos as a function of neutrino energy .",
    "the expected numbers of muons generated by neutrinos is obtained from the neutrino flux @xmath11 of the considered source and the effective area @xmath12 of the neutrino telescope : @xmath13    for neutrinos originating from wimp annihilation , the maximum energy @xmath14 is equal to the wimp mass @xmath15 , with theory suggesting wimp masses in the gev - tev range .",
    "with increasing @xmath15 more and more channels open up  both in annihilation and decay processes .",
    "the contribution of energetic ( `` hard '' ) neutrinos can significantly increase when the wimp mass becomes larger than the respective energy threshold for the production of heavy secondaries .    from calculations of the expected number of muons @xmath16 according to ( [ eqn : rate ] ) , with the dm neutrino spectra from @xcite",
    ", we estimated the size of the angular bin for which a wimp signal could be detected with @xmath10 probability .",
    "the found relation between half open cone toward the sun and wimp mass is shown in fig.[conedm ] .",
    "the three angular bins in table i are those for @xmath10 probability of signal detection ( m@xmath1790gev , m=50gev and m=30gev , respectively ) . further the upper limits on muon numbers were scaled to wimp masses .",
    "table i gives the number of events ( data , expected background and @xmath10 c.l .",
    "upper limit ) .",
    "we assumed neutrinos to be produced in two annihilation channels , b anti - b ( soft channel ) and @xmath18 ( hard channel ) which define the respective maximum energy @xmath14 for neutrinos .",
    "the resulting upper limits on muon fluxes at @xmath10 c.l . are shown in fig.[uppshmuon ] , as function of the wimp mass , for the two selected samples and for soft and hard neutrino spectra ( normalized to @xmath19=1 gev ) .",
    "the upper limit on the wimp - induced neutrino flux from the sun is found to be @xmath20 for @xmath21 and for the annihilation channel @xmath22 ( sample b ) .",

    "up to now all operating neutrino telescopes ( see the talks of the icecube and antares collaborations at this conference ) and the past generation ( baksan @xcite,@xcite macro @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite ) reported no excess of upward going muons from the direction of the sun when compared to the expectation for atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "this constrains both the annihilation rate in the sun and ( in concert with direct wimp searches ) the wimp interaction cross section .",
    "upper limits on muon fluxes from the sun obtained by neutrino telescopes are shown in fig.[baikal2_4 ] ( adapted from @xcite ; all limits are for 1 gev threshold ) .",
    "the baikal curve corresponds to hard neutrino spectra and is for @xmath23 obtained from sample b , above this value from sample a ( extrapolated up to 3tev ) .",
    "the amanda - ii @xcite and icecube @xcite limits are shown for hard neutrino spectra .",
