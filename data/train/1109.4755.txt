    "the first step of planet formation in protoplanetary disks is the collisional growth of ( sub-)micron - sized dust particles ( or aggregates ) , and consequent sedimentation .",
    "dust settling and the formation of a dust layer at the midplane of the disk play an important role in the subsequent planetesimal formation process .",
    "enhancement of the particle density in the dust layer accelerates the collisional growth rate .",
    "if the density enhancement is high enough , planetesimals may form through the gravitational instability of the dust layer ( goldreich & ward 1973 ; sekiya 1983 ) .",
    "however , the turbulent motion of the gas hinders the dust layer from thinning .",
    "dust particles are stirred by turbulence and diffuse to high altitudes from the midplane .",
    "thus , turbulence is an impediment to planetesimal formation .",
    "turbulence excited by magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) is so strong that the dust layer can not become thin enough to induce planetesimal formation through gravitational instability ( johansen & klahr 2005 ; fromang &  papaloizou 2006 ; turner et al .",
    "2006 ; carballido et al .",
    "2006 , 2011 ; fromang & nelson 2009 ) .",
    "in addition , the turbulence - induced collisional velocity can be high enough to destroy dust aggregates ( carballido et al . 2008 , 2010 ) , though several mechanisms have been proposed to overcome this difficulty ( johansen et al .",
    "2007 , 2011 ; lyra et al . 2008 , 2009 ) . even if the gas disk exhibits an initially laminar flow ( such as is expected in the dead zone where the ionization fraction of the gas is too low to couple to the magnetic field , as mentioned in gammie 1996 and sano et al .",
    "2000 ) , dust settling itself induces turbulence .",
    "the dust particles tend to rotate around the central star faster than the gas because the gas experiences a pressure gradient force acting in the opposite direction of the gravity of the star .",
    "when the dust layer thins and the dust - to - gas ratio in the layer approaches unity , the velocity difference from that of the upper gas layer induces kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability and excites turbulence in the dust layer ( e.g. , goldreich & ward 1973 ; sekiya & ishitsu 2000 , 2001 ; garaud &  lin 2004 ) .",
    "the velocity difference between the dust particles and the gas inside the dust layer also induces streaming instability ( youdin & goodman 2005 ; youdin & johansen 2007 ; johansen & youdin 2007 ; see chiang & youdin 2010 for review on the various instability in the dust layer ) .",
    "laminar gas disks are considered excellent sites for planetesimal formation .",
    "thus , it is important to clarify how turbulence induced in the dust layer diffuses the dust particles , versus dust sedimentation .",
    "several analytical and numerical studies have focused on this problem ( cuzzi et al .",
    "1993 ; champney et al . 1995 ; sekiya 1998 ; dobrovolskis et al .",
    "1999 ; johansen et al . 2006 ; michikoshi &  inutsuka 2006 ; weidenschilling 2006 , 2010 ; bai &  stone 2010a , 2010b ) .",
    "sekiya ( 1998 , hereafter s98 ) analytically solved for the structure of the dust layer under turbulence induced by kh instability . to derive the density profile of the dust layer analytically",
    ", the author adopted several assumptions .",
    "first , the dust particles were assumed to be small enough and were coupled so tightly to the gas that the dust and the gas could be treated as a single fluid .",
    "second , the density structure was adjusted to keep the dust layer marginally unstable to kh instability .",
    "third , the effects of the coriolis force and of the keplerian shear were neglected .",
    "these assumptions allowed the author to determine analytically the density structure of the dust layer and to discuss how far from the midplane the dust particles diffuse due to turbulence .",
    "the analysis in s98 provided a useful guide for subsequent numerical studies that investigated turbulence of the dust layer with more realistic assumptions . in reality , however , dust particles that are not tightly coupled to gas play an important role in inducing turbulence . also , other kinds of instability , such as streaming instability , may occur before kh instability sets in ( bai & stone 2010a ) .",
    "thus , in addition to performing numerical simulations , it is desirable to include an analytic discussion on the structure of the dust layer using a more general set of assumptions than adopted in s98 .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the analysis presented in s98 from a different point of view .",
    "in s98 , the density structure of the dust layer was determined by the condition that the dust layer was marginally unstable to kh instability ; i.e. , the richardson number , @xmath6 , had a constant critical value . in the stability condition on @xmath6 , the free energy due to the shear velocity",
    "is compared with the energy needed to lift the material against the vertical gravity ( chandrasekhar 1961 ) . in the case of a dust layer ,",
    "the free energy of the azimuthal velocity is compared with the gravitational potential in the vertical direction .",
    "we also discuss the energetics of the dust layer to determine the density structure , but in this paper we focus on the gravitational potential in the radial direction . sustaining steady turbulence",
    "requires an energy supply .",
    "the source of the free energy for kh instability or streaming instability is the velocity difference between the dust and the gas .",
    "because this free energy is consumed in the process of exciting turbulence , a velocity difference must be continually induced to provide steady turbulence .",
    "this velocity difference originates from the force balance in the radial direction between the stellar gravity , the centrifugal force , and the pressure gradient . in other words ,",
    "the velocity difference is induced because the gas resides in a slightly shallower effective potential ( including both the stellar gravity and the gas pressure ) , than the effective potential for the dust .",
    "the dust loses its angular momentum due to gas drag and drifts towards the star , while the gas gains angular momentum and drifts outward .",
    "the total angular momentum remains constant .",
    "because the effective potential for the dust is deeper , this process releases gravitational energy that can be a source of the free energy for turbulence .",
    "( the relationship between the angular momentum variation , @xmath7 , and the energy variation , @xmath8 , for circular orbiting material is @xmath9 , where the angular velocity , @xmath10 , is different for the gas and for the dust . )",
    "if the gas disk is initially in a state of laminar flow , i.e. , if gas drag is the only process that exchanges angular momentum , then dust accretion is the source of the free energy used to induce turbulence .",
    "the accretion rate of the dust due to gas drag has been calculated in the literature ( nakagawa et al .",
    "1986 , hereafter nsh86 ; weidenschilling 2003 ; youdin & chiang 2004 ) . using this dust accretion rate , and assuming that a certain fraction of the accretion energy is transferred to turbulence , it is straightforward to calculate the strength of the turbulence and to determine the density structure of the dust layer . in this paper",
    ", we show that an analysis of the energetics based on the gravitational potential in the radial direction results in a dust layer structure that is qualitatively equivalent to the dust layer structure developed in the analysis presented in s98 . most of the important properties of the s98 model are reproduced .",
    "our analysis avoids some of the assumptions that were adopted in s98 .",
    "specifically , we do not assume tight coupling between the gas and the dust , nor a marginally unstable structure for kh instability .",
    "( the effects of the coriolis force and of keplerian shear , which are still neglected in this paper , are discussed by ishitsu & sekiya 2002 , 2003 ; gmez & ostriker 2005 ; chiang 2008 ; barranco 2009 ; lee et al . 2010 . )",
    "thus , the results of this paper may be applied to more general situations , including situations in which the dust is weakly coupled to the gas , or in which streaming instability acts as a source of turbulence .    in  [ sec : assump ] , we describe our model assumptions . in  [ sec : eneinp ] , the energy release rate of the accreting dust is calculated . in  [ sec : turbstr ] , the strength of the turbulence is derived and its asymptotic forms in the limits of a small dust - to - gas ratio and a tight dust - gas coupling are discussed . in  [ sec : comppre ] , the results of our model are compared with the s98 model and with previous numerical simulations of kh instability and streaming instability . in  [ sec : dustvelocity ] , we discuss how dust layer formation reduces the radial drift velocity of the dust and the relative velocity of the dust particles . in  [ sec : ene - into - tur ] , we check the applicability of our model to turbulence in the dust layer for the kh instability and streaming instability cases .",
    "we consider a dust layer that forms after dust particles have settled to the midplane of a gas disk around a star . before the dust settles , the gas disk is assumed to be subject to laminar flow .",
    "this means that we consider the dead zone where mri is inactive because of the low degree of ionization .",
    "turbulent gas motion may be present even in the dead zone because sound waves propagate from the active layers at high altitudes and disturb the gas in the dead zone ( fleming & stone 2003 ; suzuki et al . 2010 ; okuzumi & hirose 2011 ) .",
    "we assume that the dead zone is wide enough that the active layer can not induce strong turbulence at the midplane .    even in an initially laminar disk , dust sedimentation and the formation of the midplane dust layer can not proceed in a perfectly undisturbed fashion .",
    "when the midplane dust - to - gas ratio reaches a critical value , the velocity differences between the dust layer and the upper gas layer , or between the individual dust particles and the surrounding gas , will start to induce hydrodynamical instabilities , such as kh instability or streaming instability ( see chiang & youdin 2010 for review ) .",
    "consequently , turbulent diffusion of the dust particles terminates further dust settling .",
    "it is expected that a steady dust layer forms , in which particle settling and turbulent diffusion balance each other .",
    "in such a state , vertical settling is no longer an energy source for turbulence , but the radial accretion of the dust still proceeds .",
    "the turbulence is maintained by the energy liberated from dust accretion to the star .",
    "we calculate the dust accretion rate and consequent energy release , assuming that a steady dust layer has formed . the strength of the turbulence is then estimated .",
    "the balance between the turbulent diffusion and the dust settling determines the dust layer thickness .",
    "thus , the structure of the dust layer , the dust accretion rate , and the turbulence strength must be determined self - consistently .    for simplicity , we focus on a narrow axisymmetric ring region at a certain radius @xmath11 from the central star .",
    "we consider the dust layer structure only in the vertical direction , neglecting any radial variation in the properties of the gas disk and the dust layer .",
    "all the dust particles are assumed to have a uniform size , i.e. , the size distribution of the dust particles is neglected in this paper .",
    "if the effect of gas drag on the dust were negligible , the dust particles would orbit at the keplerian velocity @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the gravitational constant and @xmath14 is the mass of the central star .",
    "however , the orbital velocity of the gas is slightly less than the keplerian velocity because the direction of the gas pressure gradient is usually outward from the star .",
    "this cancels part of the contribution to the orbital velocity from the gravity of the star .",
    "given a negligible influence of the drag force from the dust , the angular velocity of the gas would be @xmath15 here , @xmath16 represents the deviation of the gas orbital velocity from the keplerian value .",
    "it is half of the ratio between the gas pressure gradient force and the gravity of the central star , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the gas density and pressure , respectively .",
    "we consider a thin dust layer in which most of the dust particles have settled on the midplane of the gas disk .",
    "the gas disk is isothermal in the vertical direction with a scale height of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the gas sound speed . because the thickness of the dust layer is much smaller than the scale height of the gas disk , the gas density @xmath18 in the dust layer",
    "is treated as a constant .",
    "its value is given by the column density of the gas disk @xmath22 as @xmath23 the dust density profile in the vertical direction , @xmath24 , is determined by the balance between the dust settling and turbulent diffusion ( youdin & lithwick 2007 , hereafter yl07 ) .",

    "this prescription and equation ( 24 ) of yl07 give @xmath36 the dust density profile is written as @xmath37 where the midplane dust - to - gas ratio @xmath38 is increased by a factor @xmath39 from the total dust - to - gas ratio or the `` metallicity '' of the disk @xmath40 , @xmath41 we define @xmath42 as the ratio of the total ( dust and gas ) density to the gas density , @xmath43      in our model , the turbulent parameter @xmath34 and the structure of the dust layer ( i.e. , the thickness , @xmath44 , and the midplane dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath38 ) are determined for a given parameter set ( the stopping time of the dust particles @xmath27 , the disk metallicity @xmath45 , and the parameters for the gas disk ) .",

    "the @xmath53 dependence of the results will be discussed in  [ sec : disketa ] .",
    "the energy supply for turbulence comes from liberation of the gravitational energy of the dust .",
    "as the dust falls towards the central star , the dust particles penetrate more deeply into the potential well of the star .",
    "although the gas drifts outward to conserve the total angular momentum , the difference in the effective gravitational potential between the dust ( @xmath54 ) and the gas ( @xmath55 ) , including the work done by the pressure gradient , causes a net energy liberation .",
    "part of the liberated energy is converted directly into thermal energy , and part is used for supplying energy to the turbulence ( see discussion in  [ sec : ene - into - tur ] ) .",
    "dust particle accretion occurs either individually or collectively .",
    "individual dust particles suffer gas drag given a velocity difference between the particle and the gas .",
    "usually the orbital velocity of the gas is slower than that of the dust particle , and the gas drag force decelerates the particle orbital motion .",
    "thus , the particle loses its angular momentum and drifts inward .",
    "in addition to this individual drift , a collective drag works on the whole dust layer . the dust layer at the midplane orbits faster than the gas layer at higher altitudes because in the dust layer the increased inertia of the enriched dust particles weakens the effect of the gas pressure .",
    "the dust layer rotates with a velocity close to the keplerian value . the upper gas layer , devoid of the inertia of the dust , orbits more slowly than the midplane dust layer .",
    "if the gas exhibits turbulent viscosity , then the slower orbiting gas layer exerts a drag force on the dust layer , and consequently the dust layer loses its angular momentum and accretes inward .",
    "we consider the energy release rate of the dust caused by individual and collective drag .",
    "we calculate the gravitational energy released when dust particles accrete towards the star due to drag on individual particles . in this calculation",
    ", we assume that the gas disk is in a laminar flow state , and that dust particles drift inward steadily .",
    "any random motion of particles caused by gas turbulence is neglected .",
    "we expect that in turbulent gas disks , the average motion of the dust particles can be estimated from the motion in the laminar disk ( bai & stone 2010 ) . because the individual drag is more effective than the collective drag when the midplane dust - to - gas ratio is less than unity ( see fig .

    "the gas drift velocity is @xmath61 the effective gravities ( including the pressure gradient force ) acting on the dust and on the gas are @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "while the total angular momentum is conserved , the total energy is not conserved because of the difference in the effective gravities acting on the gas and on the dust , @xmath64 , providing a source of energy for turbulence .    note that , in the above calculation , @xmath57 and @xmath60 are the terminal velocities .",
    "this means that the gravitational accelerations of the dust and gas are balanced by the drag forces , and liberated energy translates directly into thermal energy .",
    "thus , no energy would be contributed to turbulence . in reality , however , if the gas disk is turbulent , a steady terminal velocity is not expected , and acceleration phases of the dust must occur , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : ene - into - tur ] . in an acceleration phase , the work done by gravity first provides kinetic energy , which can be translated into turbulent energy .",

    "given that some portion of the accretion energy of the dust is consumed by the outward motion of the gas , the liberated gravitational energy per unit surface area of the disk is,@xmath68 where the factor of @xmath69 comes from the fact that half of the work done by gravity is used for acceleration ( and deceleration ) of the azimuthal velocity of the dust ( and of the gas ) as their semi - major axes change .",

    "the second assumption is that the turbulent layer has a thickness comparable to that of the dust layer .",

    "the dust layer would behave just like a boundary wall at the bottom of the turbulent layer .",
    "turbulence in such a thick boundary gas layer has been discussed using the analogy of the ekman layer ( e.g. , cuzzi et al . 1993 ) .",
    "if the turbulent layer were dominated by the dust layer , then the structure of the dust layer would control the turbulence strength .",
    "we focus on such a dusty turbulent layer .",

    "the simulation shows strong particle clumping when @xmath256 in the r10 run and also temporal clumping for @xmath256 in the r30 run .",
    "such clumping of particles in turbulent eddies may suppress diffusion of particles compared to the no - clumping cases of @xmath253 and could be a cause of a decrease in @xmath34 when @xmath257 is increased in the simulation .",
    "even if the largest particles ( of @xmath258 ) concentrate in clumps , the smallest particles ( of @xmath259 ) do not clump , and continue to follow the turbulent diffusion of the gas ( fig .",

    "note that we compare diffusion coefficients in the different directions . since the smallest particles spread out to high altitudes where turbulence is weak , it is difficult to measure the vertical diffusion coefficient for the smallest particles in the simulation . in figure",
    "[ fig : alpha - bai]@xmath260 , though we still see a discrepancy compared with the r30 run , our model appears more consistent with the simulation results , suggesting that our model properly predicts the `` gas '' diffusion coefficient .",
    "if the dust - to - gas ratio in the dust layer were larger than unity , the radial drift velocity of dust particles would be lower than the value that the particles would have in a gas - rich environment because the gas drag force could not accelerate sufficiently against the large inertia of the dust .",
    "this effect was pointed out by nsh86 and is seen in equation ( [ eq : vdr1 ] ) for the radial velocity due to individual drag . if the dust - to - gas ratio were much larger than unity , dust accretion would be caused by collective drag exerted from the slower - orbiting upper gas layer ( weidenschilling 2003 ) .",
    "the radial drift velocity of the dust is thus a function of the turbulence strength , @xmath34 . for weaker turbulence , the dust - to - gas ratio in the dust layer is higher , and the individual drag is weaker .",
    "the collective drag is also weaker at smaller @xmath34 because the reynolds stress @xmath81 is proportional to @xmath34 .",

    "the radial drift velocity is calculated separately for the components due to individual drag and due to collective drag . for each component",

    "first , the averaged value of the radial drift velocity due to individual drag is calculated from equation ( [ eq : vdr1 ] ) , @xmath262 the radial drift velocity due to collective drag is calculated from the vertically - averaged angular momentum loss of the dust component . integrating equation ( [ eq : dlddt ] ) gives,@xmath263 where @xmath102 is given by equation ( [ eq : sig_vis2 ] ) .",

    "the relative velocity of dust particles due to turbulence , @xmath273 , is calculated for @xmath214 by substituting @xmath274 and @xmath275 into equation ( 29 ) in ormel & cuzzi ( 2007 ) , and is shown in figure [ fig : velocity ] as a dashed line .",

    "@xmath295 decreases as @xmath296 . if @xmath297 , the inner part of the disk is more suitable for gravitational instability , and vice versa .      in this paper",
    ", we calculate the liberated gravitational energy from dust accretion , assuming some fraction of the liberated energy is transferred to turbulence .",
    "the estimate of the dust accretion rate is based on the formula for the particle terminal velocity derived in nsh86 .",
    "`` the terminal velocity '' means that all the liberated energy is consumed by gas drag , converting directly into the thermal energy of the dust particles and of the surrounding gas molecules .",
    "thus , one may expect that only a small fraction ( or nothing ) of the liberated energy would be used for maintaining turbulence .",
    "however , a comparison with the simulation of kh instability by jhk06 shows that the efficiency factor @xmath298 is not negligibly small . in the following subsection",
    ", we discuss the validity of using the particle terminal velocity for calculating the energy supply rate to turbulence .",
    "the energy liberation rate from the accreting dust calculated in ",
    "[ sec : eneinp ] is compared with the deposit rate of the free energy that is the source of several instabilities , such as kh instability and streaming instability .",
    "the free energy that induces the kh instability originates from the velocity difference between the midplane dust layer and the upper gas layer , and is stored as the dust particles settle to the midplane .",
    "we estimate the deposit rate of the free energy during dust sedimentation , and show that it has the same order of magnitude as the energy liberation rate from the dust accretion towards the star .",
    "consider two states of dust distribution : the initial state , in which the dust particles are distributed uniformly in the gas disk , and the final state , in which all the dust has settled at the midplane . in the initial state , there is no vertical shear in the disk , and in the final state , the velocity difference @xmath299 appears between the midplane dust layer and the upper gas layer . the free energy for kh instability is @xmath300 , for @xmath301 .",
    "the settling timescale is @xmath302 , and then the energy deposit rate is @xmath303 which is the same order as the energy liberation rate of the accreting dust ( eqs . [ [ eq : ene_drag ] ] and [ [ eq : sig_drag2 ] ] ) .",
    "hence , the deposition rate of the free energy for kh instability can be estimated by the energy liberation rate of the accreting dust .      the free energy for streaming instability originates from the velocity difference between the dust particles and the surrounding gas .",
    "when streaming instability begins , the velocity difference decreases as the free energy is consumed by inducing turbulence .",
    "in fact , this decrease in the velocity difference can be seen even in the linear growth regime .",
    "youdin & goodman ( 2005 ) showed in their figure 6 that the velocity difference between the dust and gas decreases ( increases ) at the locations where the particle density increases ( decreases ) .",
    "the spatially averaged value of the free energy decreases as the perturbation grows .",
    "thus , without an energy supply , streaming instability would cease . given a state in which the velocity difference between the dust and the gas has reduced ,",
    "the dust particles are no longer in equilibrium : the gravity , the centrifugal force , and the gas drag force are not in balance .",
    "the dust particles are accelerated and the velocity difference from the gas rises again . to estimate the effect of the energy deposition on the velocity difference , we consider a state in which the dust density is similar to the gas density , @xmath304 .",
    "in such a state , streaming instability occurs efficiently with a growth time of the order of the keplerian time ( for the short wave branch , youdin & goodman 2005 ; youdin & johansen 2007 ) . for dust particles of @xmath305 ,",
    "the terminal velocities of the dust and of the gas are of the order of @xmath306 ( eq . [ [ eq : vdr ] ] , [ [ eq : vgr ] ] ) , and thus , the free energy per unit area is @xmath307 .",
    "this deposition of free energy occurs during the acceleration phase of the dust , and thus in the stopping time @xmath308 , and then the energy is transferred to turbulence in the growth timescale @xmath309 of streaming instability .",
    "thus , the timescale for the energy deposit in turbulence is the sum of these timescales , and for @xmath90 , @xmath310 .",
    "the energy deposition rate is @xmath311 which is smaller by a factor @xmath27 than the estimate from the dust accretion rate ( eq.[[eq : ene_drag ] ] ) .",
    "hence , our estimate , derived from the dust accretion rate , is appropriate for particles of @xmath258 . for smaller particles ( @xmath312 ) ,",
    "the energy deposition rate is higher for kh instability than for streaming instability , and kh instability is expected to operate first .",
    "the energy deposition rate for instability ( either for kh or streaming instabilities ) is estimated from the energy liberation rate due to dust accretion .",
    "in this paper , we discuss turbulence induced in the dust layer . the turbulence strength or the parameter @xmath34",
    "is determined using the energetics of dust accretion towards the central star .",
    "the key concept is that the dust particles reside in a deeper potential than the gas .",
    "the effective potential , including the gas pressure , is @xmath55 for the gas , and @xmath54 for the dust .",
    "when angular momentum is transferred from the dust to the gas through gas drag , the dust particles lose more energy than the gas gains .",
    "the excess energy can be used for exciting turbulence .",
    "if the dust accretion due to gas drag is a primary source of energy liberation , i.e. , if the gas accretion rate due to turbulence is much smaller than the dust accretion rate , then the turbulence strength is determined by the energy supply rate from the dust accretion .",
    "this is not the case if the gas disk itself is turbulent via , e.g. , mri .",
    "if the dust layer is composed of large particles with stopping time @xmath92 , then the gas accretion may dominate the dust accretion , as discussed in  [ sec : coldrag ] .",
    "we estimate the dust accretion rate using the terminal velocity profiles of the dust particles in a laminar disk derived by nsh86 .",
    "the expected turbulence strength and corresponding structure of the dust layer from our analysis agree with the previous analytical result on the marginally kh - unstable dust layer by s98 . as our analysis does not assume tight coupling of the dust to the gas , nor specify the mechanism of instability that induces turbulence , it is considered an extension of the analysis of s98 to a more general physical situation of the dust layer .",
    "the results of this paper agree with the results in michikoshi & inutsuka ( 2006 ) , which analyzes kh instability of the dust layer composed of particles with large stopping times ( @xmath161 ) , as shown in figure [ fig : michi ] .",
    "our analysis shows that , for particles of @xmath90 , the turbulence strength is smaller than @xmath313 , where @xmath122 is the efficiency of the energy supply to turbulence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] and eq .",
    "[ [ eq : alpha2 ] ] ) .",
    "this strength reaches a maximum when the disk metallicity is @xmath314 . modifying the disk metallicity from the standard value , @xmath5 , by any process , results in weaker turbulence and a thinner dust layer , and consequently may accelerate the growth process of the dust particles , as pointed out in s98 .",
    "comparison of our results with previous numerical simulations of kh and streaming instabilities by jhk06 and bai & stone ( 2010 ) shows quantitative agreement with our analysis for dust particles of @xmath315 , although there may be a qualitative disagreement for @xmath213 particles ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : alpha - joh ] @xmath316 [ fig : alpha - bai ] ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that turbulence in the dust layer is controlled by the energy supply from the dust accretion due to gas drag , provided that the dust particles are not so large that @xmath213 .",
    "in such a layer , turbulence strength is estimated by the dust accretion rate ( eq.[[eq : alpha ] ] ) .",
