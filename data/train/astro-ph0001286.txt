    "massive galaxies play a fundamental role in the chemical evolution of the universe , because they are the only systems which meet the physical conditions necessary for the build  up of heavy elements . today",
    ", by using simple techniques and modest  size telescopes , it is possible to understand how the production of metals occurs in nearby massive galaxies and to relate this production to their formation and evolution processes .    while still in its early stages",
    ", the study of chemical abundances in external galaxies has already produced important results .",
    "one of the most interesting is the discovery that galaxies in the universe seem to follow a mass  metallicity relation @xcite .",
    "although we still have to understand the physical causes behind this behavior , there is no doubt that this phenomenon is a key parameter for understanding galaxy evolution . with this prospect in mind",
    ", we recently verified that the massive starburst nucleus galaxies ( sbngs ) follow the same mass  metallicity relation as normal ones @xcite .",
    "our observations not only confirm the universality of the mass  metallicity relation for a wide range of galaxies , but also suggest that its origin may be linked to the different paths followed by early and late  type spiral galaxies to form their bulge and disk @xcite .",
    "another important phenomenon , unveiled by chemical abundance studies , is that the metallicity in the ionized interstellar medium of spiral galaxies decreases outward ( e.g. vila  costas & edmunds , 1992 , and references therein ) .",
    "various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this gradient @xcite , but their verification is difficult .",
    "the reason is that many parameters and processes involved in the formation of an abundance gradient are still not well understood , such as the initial mass function , the yield , the mechanisms and time scales for the formation of halos , bulges and disks , as well as the possible infall or outfall of matter .",
    "different numerical simulations have shown , however , that one important ingredient for producing abundance gradients is a non linear dependence of the star formation rate on gas density @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that once an abundance gradient is established , the presence of gas flows can either amplify or reduce it @xcite .",
    "attempts to relate abundance gradients to other characteristics of galaxies , such as morphological type , luminosity or circular velocity , have also been performed @xcite , but no clear correlation has emerged .",
    "one interesting trend is however observed : barred spiral galaxies seem to have shallower abundance gradients than non  barred ones @xcite . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", bars are expected to funnel gas from the outer parts to the nuclei of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the flow along the bar can induce strong mixing @xcite and reduce metallicity gradients .",
    "but star formation induced by the bar can also be strong enough to counteract dilution effects and increase the gradient in the inner parts of galaxies .",
    "steep abundance gradients have indeed been reported in the inner parts of some barred galaxies , such as ngc 3359 @xcite and ngc 1365 @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we analyse the abundance gradients of oxygen ( o / h ) and nitrogen to oxygen ratio ( n / o ) in 16 barred starburst galaxies .",
    "our goal is to establish if starburst galaxies follow the trends observed in normal galaxies .",
    "we also want to determine if there is a relation between the bar and the burst of star formation .",
    "we have recently proposed that sbngs may be `` young '' galaxies still in their formation process ( coziol 1997a,1998 ) .",
    "this possibility raises several new questions .",
    "is the initial distribution of abundances in starburst galaxies flat , or have they already had enough time to establish steep gradients ?",
    "is it possible to determine how the gradient builds up in a young galaxy and establish whether the presence of the bar is important ?",
    "could bars be younger in starburst than in normal galaxies",
    "?    our analysis innovates by studying the abundance gradients of two key elements , oxygen and nitrogen , which are assumed @xcite to be produced by different types of stars and , thus , to be released into the interstellar medium on different time scales .",
    "this gives us a deeper insight into the processes of chemical evolution , because we can test the influence of star formation and of structures , like a bar , over a relatively long period of time ( a few gyrs ) .",
    "this advantage should in particular enable us to determine whether bars are young and if they play a major role in triggering or feeding the nuclear starbursts .",

    "the galaxies mrk 710 and 712 were observed during previous runs at the same telescope , using similar instrumental settings @xcite .",
    "the average seeing during the nights was of the order of 1.2 .",

    "line fluxes and equivalent widths were then measured in each elementary spectrum . for the rest of the reduction we followed the procedure outlined in contini  @xcite  ( paper i ) : the balmer (  and ) absorption contamination due to underlying stellar populations was corrected by adding 2  to the equivalent width of the balmer emission lines ; the principal balmer decrement ( / ) was used to estimate the reddening coefficient  and to calculate absolute dereddened fluxes .",
    "our analysis may differ from other studies found in the literature , because we measured the spatial variations of physical parameters only along one direction ( along the bar ) , and not across the whole two  dimensional disk .",

    "the only exceptions are two regions in mrk 545 , which have weak signal  to  noise ratios , and the inner region of ngc 6764 .",
    "there has been some confusion in the literature about the nature of the activity in this last galaxy ( see contini  1996 for the various classifications ) .",
    "our new spectra clearly show that the center of ngc 6764 , as well as the circum ",
    "nuclear regions , are the seat of liner activity . because liner is a non  thermal phenomenon ( implying either an agn or shocks ) , the metallicity in these regions can not be determined by the methods used in this paper .",
    "consequently , ngc 6764 ( and the two regions in mrk 545 ) have been excluded from our abundance gradient analysis .",
    "our sample of  regions spans a large range of excitation levels , from high  excitation spectra ( log ( ) @xmath9 0.4 ) , characteristic of galaxies , to low ",
    "excitation spectra ( log ( ) @xmath10  0.4 ) typical of sbngs @xcite .",
    "excitation regions have /  ratios which are relatively high .",
    "this is a common property of sbngs @xcite , which possess a slight overabundance of nitrogen as compared to  regions with comparable metallicity @xcite .",
    "the oxygen abundances are determined using empirical relations between log(o / h ) and the emission ",

    "the consequence of this effect is that when dust extinction is high , one overestimates the oxygen abundance using  and underestimates it using .",
    "for this reason , we will use both relations and adopt the mean value .",
    "exceptions are mrk 710 and 712 , where  was not observed and only  was used .      in the center of half of the sample galaxies ( mrk 12 , 307 , 326 , 332 , 545 , 799 , 898 and 1088 ) , balmer absorption features due to an underlying intermediate  age stellar population severely affect the measurement of the balmer emission lines .",
    "this prevents us from determining the extinction coefficient which is needed for calculating the abundances .",
    "the standard correction of 2  on the equivalent width is not adequate for these cases ( because we still can not measure  correctly ) and it is thus necessary to find a more suitable method to solve this problem .",
    "it has been known for some time that there is an empirical relation between  and log(/ ) @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using the  and  emission lines for determining the oxygen abundance is that they are not affected by underlying stellar populations .",
    "such a method is ideal for analyzing the central regions of galaxies .",
    "however , we still have to correct these lines for dust extinction .",
    "as we will now show , this can be done empirically .    according to the definition of the extinction coefficient , the observed and dereddened fluxes of the  and  lines ( hereafter  and ) are linked by the relation :    @xmath13    if one plots log(/)@xmath14 _ versus _ log(/)@xmath15 for a sample of spectra , statistically large enough to include evenly distributed values of  between 0.0 and @xmath16 1.5 , one expects the data to cover uniformly the region between the line of zero extinction and that of @xmath16 1.5 .",
    "we notice instead that the data gather along an oblique line of slope smaller than unity , which intersects the lines of constant  ( see fig .  [ rawder ] ) .",
    "this is observed in two samples of  regions in normal galaxies @xcite , as well as in our own sample of starburst galaxies ( excluding the spectra affected by balmer absorption ) .",
    "this correlation translates the fact that , on average , the larger the value of log(/ ) the larger that of .",
    "the reason behind this behavior is that log(/ ) is correlated with oxygen abundance ( see sect.[nindicator ] and fig .",
    "[ r3_n2o3 ] ) , which in turn is correlated with the amount of dust and consequently with internal extinction @xcite .",
    "this observed correlation provides us with an empirical way of estimating  from the observed fluxes of  and . using the sample of galaxies of mccall et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and our own sample ( excluding the spectra with balmer absorption ) ,",
    "we find the following relation between the observed and dereddened line ratios :    @xmath17    the correlation coefficient of this relation is 0.99 and the uncertainty on log(/)@xmath14 is less than 0.1 dex . this relation will be used in sect .",

    "following an idea developed by various authors @xcite , we now search for an empirical relation between  and /  in our sample of 16 barred starburst galaxies . for this analysis",
    "we use only the dereddened fluxes of  regions , about 300 of them , which are not affected by balmer absorption .",
    "the two quantities appear to be strongly correlated , as shown on fig .",
    "[ r3_n2o3]a , and we fit a two  degree polynomial to the data , which yields the following relation :    @xmath19    with a dispersion in  equal to 0.07 dex .",
    "to check the validity and the possible `` universality '' of the above relation , we now apply the same procedure to two samples of  regions in normal galaxies : those of mccall et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and of vila  costas & edmunds ( 1993 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ r3_n2o3]b , the behavior is the same . fitting a two  degree polynomial",
    "we obtain :    @xmath20    the dispersion in  is 0.12 dex , that is slightly higher than for our sample .    it is important to note that the two fitted curves in fig .",
    "[ r3_n2o3 ] differ by a horizontal shift of 0.14 dex .",
    "this shift is consistent with the overabundance of nitrogen in sbngs with respect to normal  regions @xcite .",
    "consequently , there is no unique relation between  and log(/ ) , but specific relations for homogeneous samples of galaxies , such as normal ones or sbngs . for a given value of the ratio /",
    ", a starburst galaxy will have a lower oxygen abundance than a normal galaxy , or , for a given abundance , a starburst galaxy will have a higher /  ratio than a normal galaxy .",
    "figure  [ r3_n2o3]a shows that our data do not reach oxygen abundances as high as in normal galaxies .",
    "this is precisely the domain where we can not determine  in the standard way , because , in starburst galaxies , such high values for oxygen abundance are observed only in the nuclear regions , which are affected by balmer absorption features .",
    "fortunately , the parallel empirical relation for normal  regions ( fig .  [ r3_n2o3]b ) continues smoothly into the high oxygen  abundance regime .",
    "we therefore consider it legitimates to use eq.[sbng ] to calculate  in this range of oxygen abundances .",
    "once we know  in the center of the sample galaxies ( using eq .",
    "[ chbeta ] ) , it is relatively easy to estimate .",
    "first , we correct ,  and  for reddening using  and estimate the dereddened  flux using the theoretical balmer decrement : @xmath21@xmath22 . then , the dereddened ratio  is computed assuming  @xmath23 , and the oxygen abundance o / h is deduced using the relation of vacca & conti @xcite .    comparing the abundances",

    "this shows that the oxygen abundance in the sample of barred starburst galaxies is not diluted by the mixing effect of the bar .    in the above analysis ,",
    "six of the global abundance gradients are in fact bar gradients , because no ionized gas was observed in the disks of these galaxies .",
    "we should therefore reexamine fig .",
    "[ oh_ggrad_mb ] and distinguish these cases from those where the global gradient includes the disk gradient . with this distinction , we find that the global gradient in fig .",
    "[ oh_ggrad_mb]a tends to steepen as the absolute magnitude increases .",
    "a linear fit performed on the data yields a correlation coefficient of 86% .",
    "but if we exclude the extreme point ( mrk 13 ) at @xmath116 , this coefficient drops to 56% .",
    "this is more a trend than a true correlation .",
    "galaxies for which the global gradient is the bar gradient also show a similar trend , but slightly displaced towards lower values .",
    "an explanation for this trend is proposed in sect .",
    "[ barsf ] .",
    "examining now the central oxygen abundances ( fig .",
    "[ oh_ggrad_mb]b ) , we find that they are on average lower in barred starburst galaxies than in normal unbarred galaxies .",
    "because the global abundance gradients in barred starburst galaxies are strong , these low central abundances can not be attributed to an artifact of the bar , that would have lowered the central abundance of chemically evolved galaxies by dilution .",
    "this means that the starburst galaxies in this sample have lower oxygen abundances than normal ones .",
    "this is in agreement with our previous finding @xcite : sbngs are chemically less evolved than normal galaxies with comparable luminosity and morphology .",
    "we have shown elsewhere @xcite , that the only way to explain this phenomenon is by assuming that sbngs are `` young '' galaxies .",
    "we have shown that trends in the oxygen abundance gradients are inconsistent with the mixing effect of a bar , unless the bar also triggers a central starburst which more than compensates for the dilution . however , the fact that we find both strong oxygen abundance gradients and lower intersects than in normal galaxies rules out a bar  triggered burst in the center of an `` old '' galaxy .",
    "but the bar could be responsible for starbursts in the center of a relatively `` young '' galaxy . in this case",
    ", there are two alternatives .",
    "the gas funneled by the bar could have been fed directly into the central region in a short time ( a few myrs ) , prompting a new burst of star formation that is sufficiently strong to produce steep abundance gradients .",
    "the other alternative is that the bar acts over a much longer time scale ( a few gyrs ) , progressively feeding the inner regions with gas that is immediately recycled ( since no mixing effects are seen ) .",
    "we can test the above two alternatives by studying the n / o abundance gradients and comparing them with the oxygen ones . in coziol @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the bulk of nitrogen in sbngs is probably produced by intermediate  mass stars , whereas oxygen is mainly released by massive stars . in this scenario ,",
    "the time scale for enrichment in nitrogen ( @xmath117 ) is much longer than the one for oxygen ( @xmath118  myr ) .",
    "this allows us to look for effects of the bar on a time scale covering a few gyrs .",
    "0.8 cm    in fig  [ no_ggrad_mb]a , we show the relation between the global n / o abundance gradient and absolute magnitude . in this figure",
    ", we distinguish galaxies with a gradient measured only along the bar from those where the gradient also includes the disk .",
    "we observe the same trend for n / o as for oxygen : galaxies with a lower luminosity seem to have a stronger negative gradient .",
    "the relation implied by this tendency has a weak correlation coefficient ( 60% with mrk 13 excluded ) and a shallower slope than that found for oxygen .",
    "again , galaxies with only a bar gradient seem to have shallower gradients than the other ones .    despite the small gradients , the central n / o values , shown in fig .",
    "[ no_ggrad_mb]b , are rather high compared to the solar abundance .",
    "this implies that many generations of intermediate  mass stars have already contributed to enrich these galaxies in nitrogen , or , equivalently , that enough time has passed in the chemical evolution of these galaxies .",
    "why is the gradient systematically weaker for n / o than for oxygen ?",
    "if this is due to the bar , it means that the effect of the bar appears on a time scale comparable to the nitrogen enrichment phase .",
    "this is unlikely as it implies that the oxygen enrichment phase , and the ensuing strong oxygen abundance gradient , happened after the nitrogen one .",
    "therefore , as a mixing mechanism , the bar should have affected both elements in the same way , which is not observed .",
    "our explanation for the observed difference is given in sect  [ constgrad ] .",
    "the fact that the n / o intersects are high rules out the possibility that the bars recently triggered central starbursts in these galaxies .",
    "a recent burst would have increased the oxygen abundance and decreased the n / o abundance ratio .",
    "the stronger the burst , the stronger the decrease in n / o",
    ". we would thus expect galaxies with the steepest oxygen abundance gradients to have the flattest n / o ones . in fig .",
    "[ no_vs_oh_ggrad]a , we show the relation between the oxygen and n / o abundance gradients .",
    "the behavior is contrary to what is expected .",
    "the bars consequently did not recently trigger bursts in these galaxies .    0.8 cm      what is then the reason for the difference between the two gradients ?",
    "in fact , the n / o abundance gradient is not independent of the oxygen one .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ no_vs_oh_ggrad]a . a linear regression on the data yields the relation : @xmath119with a correlation coefficient of 89% .",
    "surprisingly , the slope of this relation is almost the same as the one found between the n / o and oxygen abundances : a linear fit performed on the data in fig .",
    "[ no_vs_oh ] yields log(n / o)@xmath120log(o / h)@xmath121 @xcite , which is consistent with a mixture of @xmath110 origin for nitrogen @xcite .",
    "the relation between the two gradients is thus explained by the behavior of the oxygen abundance in the nuclei of the galaxies .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ no_vs_oh_ggrad]b , where the oxygen abundance gradient steepens when its intersect increases .",
    "this relation is trivial if we assume that all disks initially have about the same low oxygen abundance ( see fig .",
    "[ pli_oh_20gal ] ) . since the nitrogen enrichment is related to the increase in oxygen ( see sect .",
    "[ nitroabund ] and fig .",
    "[ no_vs_oh ] ) , the n / o abundance gradient grows with that of oxygen .",
    "the origin of both gradients in starburst galaxies can thus be explained solely by their star formation histories .",
    "the only way to reconcile the above observations of abundance gradients with the possible effect of a bar is by assuming that the latter is a slow process ; over a few gyr period , the bar progressively feeds the nucleus with gas which is immediately recycled into stars .",
    "this scenario requires a very fine tuning between the feeding of the gas in the center of galaxies and star formation .",
    "it also requires that bars are relatively stable over a long period of time ( a few gyrs ) .",
    "we can test if these conditions apply to galaxies in our sample by looking for relations between the bar properties and star formation .",
    "0.8 cm    0.6 cm    numerical simulations predict that a strong bar maintains a steeper abundance gradient in the bar than in the disk for about 1 gyr , then both become comparably low ( @xmath122 ) , and that the bar and disk gradients are never very different in the presence of a weak bar @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ bvsdgrad ] that almost all galaxies in our sample show a stronger gradient in the bar than in the disk .",
    "only two galaxies , mrk 13 and 332 , have significantly steeper gradients in the disk than in the bar , but this peculiarity can be explained by other phenomena ( see sect .  [ o_n_grad ] ) . in other words , the difference between bar and disk gradients can not be due to an old bar",
    ". it can not be due to the effect of a young bar either , because , as we previously noted , the n / o abundance ratios would be low and the gradients would be anti  correlated .",
    "a simple explanation for the stronger gradients in the bar than in the disk is that the volume density of star formation is proportional to the gas volume density to some power @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) , as proposed by schmidt s law ( 1959 , 1963 ) . assuming that the chemical enrichment is proportional to the star formation , a spherical density distribution yields a variation with radius in @xmath125 .",
    "the gradient measured from the center to the end of the bar ( or to any intermediate radius ) will necessarily be steeper than the one measured further out .",
    "the presence of ionized gas is a tracer of star formation in galaxies .",
    "half the galaxies in this sample show the presence of ionized gas over the whole bar , while in the other half , the gas is mostly concentrated in the inner parts of the bar and in the nucleus .",
    "if star formation can not result from gas flow toward the inner regions by the dynamical action of a bar , could it be linked to any other property of the bar , such as its strength or its length ?",
    "the bar strength is identified with the deprojected bar axis ratio ( b / a)@xmath126 , and its length is given by the ratio of the deprojected major axis to corrected blue isophotal diameter 2a",
    "/ d@xmath127 @xcite ( paper v ) . a bar with a ratio b /",
    "a @xmath128 is considered `` strong '' and a bar with a ratio 2a / d@xmath129 is considered `` long '' .",
    "we also identify separately galaxies with various fractions of ionized gas along the bar and galaxies with early ( earlier than sbbc ) or late  type ( sbbc or later ) morphologies .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ gas_distribution ] , most galaxies in this sample have a strong bar , which is a general characteristic of the sample of markarian barred starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "there is a trend for galaxies with a longer bar to have ionized gas over a smaller extent of the bar length , regardless of their morphology .",
    "this is not an observational selection effect , because three galaxies do not follow the above trend in fig .",
    "[ gas_distribution ] , namely mrk 306 , 712 and 1076 . in the case of mrk 306 and 1076 ,",
    "a long and strong bar with ionized gas over its whole length may be explained by the fact that they are both interacting with close companions ( the rest of our galaxies are isolated ) .",
    "mrk 712 looks like an isolated galaxy , but with a peculiar morphology .",
    "the peak of star forming activity is significantly displaced from the center of the galaxy ( see fig .  [ oh_24gal ] ) .",
    "this active region may be associated with a second nucleus @xcite , which makes this galaxy a strong candidate for a recent merger .",
    "a simple relation with the length of the bar thus explains the radial distribution of ionized gas ; star formation does not cover the whole bar just because it is too long .",
    "we have shown so far that bars , despite the fact that they are strong , can not account for the observed abundance gradients .",
    "this may be surprising in view of the convincing evidence for dynamical effects of strong bars on star formation and abundance gradients in galaxies provided by numerical simulations .",
    "the only explanation for such a situation is that bars in the current sample of galaxies are too young ( a few @xmath1 years ) to have had any effect .",
    "we verified that there are no relations between the abundance gradients and the bar properties .",
    "the oxygen and n / o abundance gradients in the bar and in the disk show the same behavior .",
    "no relation is found between the abundance gradients and the bar strength or length . nor is any relation found between the abundance gradients and the different concentrations of gas along the bar . in general , therefore , the bars have not influenced the two gradients .",
    "this supports our assumption that the bars are young .",
    "if we compare the distribution of ionized gas ( i.e. star formation ) with the oxygen abundance , we find that the behaviors of these two parameters along the bars are frequently uncorrelated ( see fig .",
    "[ oh_24gal ] and sect .",
    "[ spatdist ] ) .",
    "intense star formation does not necessarily enhance the oxygen abundance , as we can see , for example , in the extranuclear star forming regions of mrk 12 and 799",
    ". these regions must be too young ( a few myrs ) and their massive stars did not had enough time to change the chemical abundance of their environment .",
    "when we find , on the other hand , a region filled with ionized gas , but where the abundance is significantly higher , we conclude that this must be a region where star formation was `` stable '' over a longer period of time .",
    "the galaxy nuclei in our sample are obvious locations for such stable star - forming regions .",
    "the relatively high n / o abundance ratios and the high proportion of intermediate  mass stars mixed with ionized gas indicate that star formation persisted in these regions for quite a long time ( a few gyrs ) .",
    "we found no evidence that bars triggered the starbursts observed at the center of the sample galaxies . on the other hand , they may have induced star formation at the ends of the bar ( e.g. mrk 307 , 332 ) , and more frequently at only one end ( e.g. mrk 12 , 13 , 306 , 545 and 799 ) .",
    "this phenomenon may be due to gas compression in these regions @xcite .",
    "star formation induced by the bar at its ends has increased the oxygen abundance there .",
    "the result is a shallower abundance gradient in the bar and a stronger one in the disk .",
    "this may explain why the global oxygen and n / o abundance gradients are weaker when they are measured only in the bar . chemical enrichment produced by star formation at these points being lower than what is observed in the nucleus , this suggests that fewer star formation episodes occurred there , or that they happened relatively recently .    among all the possible effects of the bar on the evolution of starburst galaxies , therefore ,",
    "the only plausible one seems to be star formation induced at one or both ends of the bars .",
    "the distribution of star formation in this sample of starburst galaxies is consistent with the assumption that bars are too young ( a few @xmath1 years old ) to be at the origin of the bursts in the galaxy nuclei .",
    "one important result of our analysis is that bars have not had a great impact on the star formation history and chemical evolution of starburst galaxies .",
    "the most straightforward explanation is that bars are too young .",
    "our observations also clearly show that these young bars can not be at the origin of the nuclear starbursts .",
    "the high n / o abundance ratios together with the high level of star formation in the nuclear region of galaxies suggest that star formation proceeds almost steadily ( or as a sequence of bursts ) over a few gyr period .",
    "the fact that we find strong o / h gradients while the oxygen abundance is low in the galactic nuclei supports our interpretation that sbngs are young galaxies still in their process of formation ( coziol et al . 1997a ; 1997b ) .",
    "it seems that these starburst galaxies are still building their abundance gradients .",
    "this process can be fully explained in terms of their star formation history .",
    "the gradients build up from the inside out , becoming stronger as the oxygen and n / o abundances increase in the bulge while staying low in the disk .",
    "this behavior is consistent with a simple schmidt law relating the density of star formation to that of gas .    according to these results ,",
    "starburst galaxies seem to form their bulge first , and then their disk .",
    "if the disk is younger than the bulge and the bar forms in the disk , it is not surprizing that we find mostly young bars in starburst galaxies .",
    "the above scenario may also explain why our results are not consistent with predictions made by different models of bar formation .",
    "the initial conditions assumed in these models are far from those observed in young starburst galaxies . a bar forms in a galaxy which already has a large bulge but a disk which is probably still in formation .",
    "when star formation stops in the bulge and increases in the disk , as in normal spiral galaxies , the metallicity of the disk grows , decreasing the gradient .",
    "if the end product of a starburst galaxy is a normal spiral galaxy , the latter , therefore , should have lower metallicity gradients than the former .",
    "if they are stable , bars may also play a more important role as galaxies get older .    but",
    "how general is our conclusion ? is what we observe a trait of sbngs ?",
