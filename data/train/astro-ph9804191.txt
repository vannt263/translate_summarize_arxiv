    "the global properties of the x - ray , optical and radio afterglows of grbs have been successfully described by relativistic blast wave models ( e.g. wijers , rees and mszros 1997 ) . in this paper",
    "we show that the detailed properties of the spectrum of the afterglow of grb 970508 , and its evolution , are well described by a blast wave model in which significant cooling of the electrons plays an important role ( sari , piran and narayan 1998 ) .",
    "this model predicts the occurrence of an extra break at @xmath3 in the spectrum , corresponding to the lorentz factor @xmath10 above which the electron cooling time is shorter than the expansion time of the blast wave .",
    "in the second week after the grb 970508 event many observations of its afterglow were made by ground - based and orbiting instruments , which allows us to derive the x - ray to radio afterglow spectrum on may 21.0 ut ( 12.1 days after the event ) with only a few assumptions .    during the first month the 4.86 and 8.46 ghz observations by frail et al .",
    "( 1997a ) show strong fluctuations attributed to interstellar scintillation ( iss ; see e.g. goodman 1997 ) . at 8.46 ghz the interval of 8 to 14 days after the event corresponds to a flare .",
    "it would therefore appear that the ` true ' underlying 4.86 and 8.46 ghz flux densities are better represented by long - term average values .",
    "to discern , apart from an average flux , a possible trend in the 8.46 and 4.86 ghz data of frail et al .",
    "( 1997a ) we have fitted a power law ( in time @xmath11 , measured in days since the burst ) to the data for @xmath12 30 days .",

    "the source was detected on may 16.52 ut at 1.57 @xmath20 0.25 mjy , but on none of the other days was an individually significant detection made .",
    "however , averaging all observations obtained in the interval may 17 - 22 ( 8 - 13 days after the event ) , the source was detected at 660 @xmath20 110 @xmath14jy .",
    "again , since iss can modulate the flux densities strongly below@xmath21  ghz at this galactic latitude , we assume that the detection on may  16.52 ut was boosted by this effect , and that the source - intrinsic 15  ghz flux on may  21.0 is better represented by the five - day average stated above .",
    "bremer et al . ( 1998 ) detected grb 970508 with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) at 86 ghz but not at 232 ghz .",

    "the 1.4 ghz flux density ( region i ) is consistent with the expectation for self - absorbed emission ( @xmath44 ; katz and piran 1997 ) , i.e. the self absorption break @xmath45 @xmath9 2.5 ghz .",
    "the low - frequency region ( ii ) is in agreement with the expected low - frequency tail of synchroton radiation ( @xmath46 ; rybicki and lightman 1979 ) .",
    "the high frequency x - ray to optical slope @xmath47 is consistent ( galama et al . 1998a ; from here on paper i ) with synchroton radiation from electrons , of which a significant fraction cools rapidly , with a power - law distribution of lorentz factors , @xmath48 ( sari et al .",
    "optical multi - colour photometry , obtained in the first 5 days after the event , showed that the optical spectrum was well represented by a power law , and approached @xmath49 = @xmath50 ( 2.1 to 5.0 days after the grb ; @xmath51 after reaching maximum optical light ( galama et al . 1998b",
    "; we used @xmath52 2.1 days ) , i.e. , consistent with the x - ray to optical slope on may 21.0 ut , suggesting that the slope remained constant over this period .",
    "we note that the extrapolation of the x - ray flux is uncertain , but none of the further discussion depends on the validity of the extrapolation , since both spectral breaks we infer lie below the optical . in the spectrum",

    "only upper limits are available . extrapolating from the adjacent regions and assuming one single spectral break",
    ", we find a peak flux of 4.5  mjy at @xmath53hz .",
    "however , the temporal development of grb 970508 indicates that a second break frequency exists .      as noted before by katz , piran and sari ( 1998 ) , during the first day the optical to x - ray spectral slope of grb970508 @xmath54 ; which these authors attribute to rapid electron cooling .",
    "this is consistent with the uv excess reported by castro - tirado et al .",

    "additional observational evidence for rapid cooling of a significant fraction of the electrons is given in paper i.      sari et al .",
    "( 1998 ) argued that the most energetic electrons may lose a significant fraction of their energy to radiation .",
    "their model predicts the occurrence of an extra break at @xmath3 ( corresponding to the critical lorentz factor @xmath10 above which cooling by synchroton radiation is significant ) , in addition to the regular break frequency @xmath4 ( the frequency which corresponds to the lowest - energy injected electrons ; lorentz factor @xmath61 ) .",
    "the evolution in time of the grb afterglow is determined by the evolution of the two break frequencies : @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( sari et al .",
    "we assume adiabatic evolution of the grb remnant ; see sect .",

    "1998 ) .",
    "the 86 ghz pdbi observations do not detect the source before 10 days , followed by three detections and subsequently only non detections i.e. at 86 ghz the emission peaked between @xmath9 10 and @xmath9 14 days ( bremer et al .",

    "if this maximum would correspond to the break frequency @xmath3 passing 86 ghz then we would expect the decay to be much slower , @xmath74 ( sari et al . 1998 ) .",
    "if it reflects the passage of @xmath4 the subsequent decay would go as @xmath75 ( sari et al .",
    "the observed decay rate is in marginal agreement with the passage of the break frequency @xmath68 , but definitely excludes that @xmath3 was passing 86 ghz .",
    "we therefore identify the maximum at 86 ghz with the passage of @xmath4 at @xmath76 @xmath9 12 days , i.e. at the time of the derived spectrum ( may 21.0 ut ) .",
    "there is no evidence for a break at @xmath77 ghz ( the 86 ghz detection is consistent with the low - frequency tail ; see fig .",

    "this is in remarkable agreement with the value derived above from the intersection of @xmath93 for @xmath79 in region iii with the high - frequency extrapolation .",

    "this is consistent with the expectation that @xmath3 had by then already passed the h band .",
    "the observed transitions @xmath109 @xmath9 12 days and @xmath110 1.4 days imply that @xmath111 0.006 days ( 500 s ) . for @xmath112 the dynamical evolution of the remnant",
    "is almost certainly adiabatic , while before that time it could possibly be radiative ( sari et al . 1998 ; but see mszros , rees & wijers 1998 ) .",
    "this means that one would expect nearly all of the remnant s observed dynamical evolution to be adiabatic .    however , the maximum flux at 8.46 ghz is @xmath113jy at @xmath114 55 days ( frail et al .",
    "1997a ) ; this value of @xmath115 is as expected from the 86 ghz observations , for @xmath63 .",
    "this is less than the peak of 1700 @xmath14jy at 86 ghz and would argue for some radiative losses , since in the perfectly adiabatic case the maximum flux should be constant with time , while the peak moves to lower frequencies .",
    "also the rather gradual early evolution of the radio light curves of grb 970508 and the observed transition from optically thick to thin emission at 1.4 ghz around @xmath116 days suggest the possibility of radiative evolution ( paper i ) . however , the absence of a break in the smooth power law decay of the optical light curve from 2 to 60 days after the burst ( pedersen et al . 1998 ; castro - tirado et al .",
    "1998 ; sokolov et al . 1998 ; galama et al .",
    "1998b ) shows that there is no important transition in that period .",
    "also the optical spectra and the optical temporal slope indicate adiabatic remnant dynamics with @xmath117 during this period ( paper i ) .",
    "taken together , these results indicate that some additional ingredient is needed to fully explain the radio and mm behaviour ; for example , waxman , kulkarni and frail ( 1998 ) have argued that the transition from ultrarelativistic to mildly relativistic expansion of the blast wave may explain these anomalies .",
    "we have found that on may 21.0 ut the afterglow spectrum of grb 970508 contains all the characteristic parts of a synchrotron spectrum .",
    "we infer that the dynamical evolution of the remnant is adiabatic ( in agreement with waxman et al .",
    "1998 ) , but that a significant fraction of the electrons have synchrotron cooling times shorter than the remnant s expansion time . in accordance with the theory outlined by sari et al .",
    "( 1998 ) this produces an additional break in the spectrum .",
    "the break frequencies @xmath4 and @xmath3 , corresponding to the minimum electron energy and the energy above which electrons cool rapidly , respectively , are equal at a time @xmath64 which we find is 500 s. this synchrotron spectrum and adiabatic dynamics can explain most of the afterglow behaviour over 9 decades in frequency spanning the x rays to radio waves , from the first optical to the late radio data .",
    "some aspects of the afterglow are not explained by this model : the flux at @xmath4 should be constant , but is seen to decrease from 12 days when it lies at mm wavelengths to 55 days when it lies in the radio ; the self - absorption frequency @xmath45 is predicted to be time - independent , but is seen to decrease with time and the early rise of the radio fluxes is slower than expected ( see paper i ) and finally the decay after maximum at mm wavelengths is perhaps somewhat faster than expected ( see paper i for a discussion on the radio light curves ) .    in summary , we find that an adiabatically expanding blast wave emiting synchrotron radiation , with a significant fraction of rapidly cooling electrons , describes most of the afterglow data on grb 970508 very well .",
