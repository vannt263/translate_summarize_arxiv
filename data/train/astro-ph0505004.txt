    "braneworld models have been extensively applied to cosmology , where they demonstrate qualitatively new and very interesting properties ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "theories with the simplest generic action involving scalar - curvature terms both in the bulk and on the brane are not only good in modeling cosmological dark energy but , in doing so , they also exhibit some interesting specific features , for example , the possibility of superacceleration ( supernegative effective equation of state of dark energy @xmath8 ) @xcite and the possibility of cosmological loitering even in a spatially flat universe @xcite .",
    "it was noted some time ago @xcite that the cosmological evolution in braneworld theory , from the viewpoint of the friedmann universe , proceeds with a time - dependent gravitational constant . in this letter",
    ", we further study this property and report another interesting feature of braneworld cosmology , which we call `` cosmic mimicry . ''",
    "it turns out that , for a broad range of parameter values , the braneworld model behaves _ exactly as a lcdm ( @xmath0 + cold dark matter ) universe _ with different values of the effective cosmological density parameter @xmath1 at different epochs .",
    "this allows the model to share many of the attractive features of lcdm @xcite but with the important new property that the cosmological density parameter inferred from the observations of the large - sale structure and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and that determined from neoclassical cosmological tests such as observations of supernovae ( sn ) can potentially have different values .",
    "an important feature of this model is that , although it is very similar to lcdm at the present epoch , its departure from `` concordance cosmology '' can be significant at intermediate redshifts , leading to new possibilities for the universe at the end of the `` dark ages '' which may be worth exploring .",
    "we relate the `` mimicry '' properties of the braneworld cosmology with the properties of gravity in braneworld theories .",
    "in particular , we show that the change in the cosmological density parameter @xmath1 as the universe evolves can be related to the spatial scale dependence of the effective gravitational constant in braneworld theory @xcite .",
    "this can have important consequences for cosmological models based on the braneworld theory and calls for more extensive analysis of their cosmological history .",
    "we consider the simplest generic braneworld model with an action of the form @xmath9 + \\int_{\\rm brane } \\left ( m^2 r - 2 \\sigma \\right ) + \\int_{\\rm brane } l \\left ( h_{ab } , \\phi \\right ) \\ , .\\ ] ] here , @xmath10 is the scalar curvature of the metric @xmath11 in the five - dimensional bulk , and @xmath12 is the scalar curvature of the induced metric @xmath13 on the brane , where @xmath14 is the vector field of the inner unit normal to the brane , which is assumed to be a boundary of the bulk space , and the notation and conventions of @xcite are used .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 is the trace of the symmetric tensor of extrinsic curvature @xmath16 of the brane .",
    "the symbol @xmath17 denotes the lagrangian density of the four - dimensional matter fields @xmath18 whose dynamics is restricted to the brane so that they interact only with the induced metric @xmath19 .",
    "all integrations over the bulk and brane are taken with the corresponding natural volume elements .",
    "the symbols @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the five - dimensional and four - dimensional planck masses , respectively , @xmath22 is the bulk cosmological constant , and @xmath23 is the brane tension .",
    "action ( [ action ] ) leads to the einstein equation with cosmological constant in the bulk : @xmath24 while the field equation on the brane is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the stress  energy tensor on the brane stemming from the last term in action ( [ action ] ) .",

    "the length scale @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32    the `` @xmath33 '' signs in ( [ solution ] ) correspond to two different branches of the braneworld solutions @xcite .",
    "models with the lower ( `` @xmath34 '' ) sign were called brane1 , and models with the upper ( `` @xmath35 '' ) sign were called brane2 in @xcite , and we refer to them in this way throughout this paper .    in what follows , we consider a spatially flat universe ( @xmath36 ) without dark radiation ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless cosmological parameters @xmath38 where the subscript `` 0 '' refers to the current values of cosmological quantities .",
    "the cosmological equation with the energy density @xmath39 dominated by dust - like matter can now be written in a transparent form : @xmath40 the model satisfies the constraint equation @xmath41 reducing the number of independent @xmath42 parameters .",
    "the sign choices in eqs .",
    "( [ hubble0 ] ) and ( [ omega - r1 ] ) always correspond to each other if @xmath43 . in the opposite case , @xmath44 , both signs in ( [ omega - r1 ] )",
    "correspond to the lower sign in ( [ hubble0 ] ) , and the option with both upper signs in eqs .",
    "( [ hubble0 ] ) and ( [ omega - r1 ] ) does not exist ( see the appendix of the first paper in @xcite for details ) .",
    "the signs in ( [ omega - r1 ] ) correspond to the two possible ways of bounding the schwarzschild(anti)-de  sitter bulk space by the brane @xcite .    in the `` normal '' case @xmath45 , substituting @xmath46 from ( [ omega - r1 ] ) into ( [ hubble0 ] ) , we get & = & _ m ( 1+z)^3 + 1 - _ m + 2 _ 2 + & & 2 . [ hubble1 ]    in the `` special '' case @xmath47 , the brane1 model [ the lower sign in ( [ hubble0 ] ) ] corresponds to both signs of ( [ omega - r1 ] ) , and the cosmological equation reads as follows : & = & _ m ( 1+z)^3 + 1 - _ m + 2 _ 2 + & - & 2 .",
    "[ hubble2 ]    for sufficiently high redshifts , the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ hubble1 ] ) or ( [ hubble2 ] ) dominates , and the model reproduces the matter - dominated friedmann universe with the density parameter @xmath48 .",
    "now we note that , for the values of @xmath4 and parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 which satisfy _ m ( 1+z)^3 ( ) ^2 , [ eq : mimic0 ] both eqs .",
    "( [ hubble1 ] ) and ( [ hubble2 ] ) can be well approximated as [ hubble3 ] _",
    "m ( 1+z)^3 + 1 - _ m - .",
    "we introduce the positive parameter @xmath51 by the equation @xmath52 then , defining a new density parameter by the relation [ lcdm ] ^lcdm_m = 1 _ m , we get ^lcdm_m ( 1+z)^3 + 1 - ^lcdm_m , [ eq : lcdm ] which is precisely the hubble parameter describing a lcdm universe .",
    "[ note that the braneworld parameters @xmath50 and @xmath49 have been effectively absorbed into a `` renormalization '' of the matter density @xmath53 , defined by ( [ lcdm ] ) .",
    "since the value of the parameter @xmath54 should be positive by virtue of the cosmological considerations , in the case of the upper sign in ( [ hubble3 ] ) and ( [ lcdm ] ) , we restrict ourselves to the parameter region @xmath55 , i.e. , we exclude the special case of brane1 model with the upper sign in ( [ omega - r1 ] ) from consideration . ]",
    "thus , our braneworld displays the following remarkable behaviour which we refer to as _ `` cosmic mimicry '' _ :",
    "* a brane1 model , which at high redshifts expands with density parameter @xmath48 , at lower redshifts _ masquerades as a lcdm universe _ with a _ smaller value _ of the density parameter . in other words , at low redshifts , the brane1 universe expands as the lcdm model ( [ eq : lcdm ] ) with @xmath56 [ where @xmath54 is determined by ( [ lcdm ] ) with the lower ( `` @xmath35 '' ) sign ] . * a brane2 model at low redshifts also masquerades as lcdm but with a _ larger value _ of the density parameter .",
    "in this case , @xmath57 with @xmath54 being determined by ( [ lcdm ] ) with the upper ( `` @xmath34 '' ) sign .",
    "the range of redshifts over which this cosmic mimicry occurs is given by @xmath58 , with @xmath59 determined by ( [ eq : mimic0 ] ) .",
    "specifically , z _ = - 1 , [ eq : mimic1 ] which can also be written as ( 1+z_)^3 = _ ( 1 + _ _ b ) ( _ ^lcdm ) ^2 [ eq : new1 ] for both braneworld models .    examples of cosmic mimicry are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] for the brane1 model , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] for the brane2 model .",
    "one striking consequence of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] is that a low - density ( @xmath60 ) universe consisting _ entirely _ of baryons mimics a higher - density lcdm model ( @xmath61 ) and can therefore be in excellent agreement with the sn data .    in view of relation ( [ eq : new1 ] ) , it is interesting to note that we can use the equations derived in this paper to relate the three free parameters in the braneworld model : @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "these relations ( which turn out to be the same for brane1 and brane2 models ) are : [ eq : relation ] & = & ( 1+z_)^3 , + & = & ^2 ( 1+z_)^3 .",
    "furthermore , if we assume that the value of @xmath64 is known ( say , from the analysis of sn data ) , then the two braneworld parameters @xmath50 and @xmath65 can be related to the two parameters @xmath48 and @xmath66 using ( [ eq : relation ] ) , so it might be more convenient to analyze the model in terms of @xmath48 and @xmath66 ( instead of @xmath50 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "we also note that , under condition ( [ eq : mimic0 ] ) , the brane tension @xmath23 , determined by ( [ omega - r1 ] ) , is positive for brane1 model , and negative for brane2 model .",
    "since the hubble parameter in braneworld models departs from that in lcdm at _ intermediate _ redshifts ( @xmath67 ) , this could leave behind an important cosmological signature especially since several key cosmological observables depend upon the hubble parameter either differentially or integrally .",
    "examples include :    * the luminosity distance @xmath68 : = c_0^z dz h(z ) , [ eq : lumdis ] * the angular - size distance d_a(z ) = _ 0^z dz h(z ) , [ eq : angdis ] * the product @xmath69 , which plays a key role in the alcock  paczynski anisotropy test @xcite , * the product @xmath70 , which is used in the volume - redshift test @xcite , * the deceleration parameter : [ eq : decel ] q(z ) = ( 1+z ) - 1 , * the effective equation of state of dark energy : [ eq : state0 ] w(z ) = 2 q(z ) - 1 3 , _ ( z ) = _ ^2 ( 1 + z)^3 , * the age of the universe : [ eq : age ] t(z ) = _ z^ , * the `` statefinder pair '' @xcite : @xmath71 * the electron - scattering optical depth to a redshift @xmath72 ( z_reion ) = c_0^z_reion , [ eq : reion ] where @xmath73 is the electron density and @xmath74 is the thomson cross - section describing scattering between electrons and cmb photons .    a degree of caution should be exercised when comparing the late - time lcdm behaviour ( [ eq : lcdm ] ) of our model with different sets of observations , since the parameter @xmath75 , residing in ( [ eq : lcdm ] ) , which is effectively used in determinations of the luminosity distance ( [ eq : lumdis ] ) and angular - size distance ( [ eq : angdis ] ) , may very well be different from the value of @xmath48 inferred from observations of gravitational clustering .",
    "these issues should be kept in mind when performing a maximum - likelihood analysis using data belonging to different observational streams .",
    "cosmological tests based on the luminosity distance and angular - size distance typically probe lower redshifts @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , if the mimicry redshift is @xmath77 , the braneworld model will , for all practical purposes , be indistinguishable from the lcdm cosmology on the basis of these tests alone .",
    "however , tests which probe higher redshifts should be able to distinguish between these models . for instance",
    ", since @xmath78 in brane2 at redshifts larger than the mimicry redshift , it follows that the age of the universe will be greater in this model than in the lcdm cosmology .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : age ] for three distinct values of the cosmological density parameter : @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , all of which are lower than @xmath82 .",
    "the age of the universe in the brane2 model is shown with respect to the lcdm value .",
    "the mimicry redshift ( [ eq : new1 ] ) is @xmath83 so that @xmath84 at @xmath85 .",
    "the braneworld models have @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 ( bottom to top ) whereas @xmath82 .",
    "note that the braneworld models are older than lcdm.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    since the late - time evolution of the universe is t(z ) ( 1+z)^-3/2 , one finds , for @xmath86 , ( z ) . since @xmath87 in the brane2 model , we find that the age of a brane2 universe is greater than that of a lcdm universe .",
    "( the reverse is true for the brane1 model , for which @xmath88 . )",
    "the altered rate of expansion in the braneworld model at late times ( @xmath89 ) also affects other cosmological quantities including the redshift of reionization which , for the brane2 model , becomes smaller than that in the lcdm cosmology .",
    "this is because the lower value of @xmath90 in the brane2 model ( relative to the lcdm model ) , when substituted to ( [ eq : reion ] ) , gives a correspondingly lower value for @xmath72 for an identical value of the optical depth @xmath91 in both models .",
    "( in fact , it is easy to see that , for the brane2 model , the value of @xmath72 decreases with decreasing @xmath66 and @xmath48 . )",
    "hence , braneworld cosmology makes it possible to have a value for the reionization redshift which is lower than @xmath92 inferred for the lcdm model from the data of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite .",
    "both an increased age of the universe and a lower redshift of reionization are attractive properties of the braneworld model which , as we have seen , mimics the lcdm cosmology at lower redshifts @xmath93 .",
    "it is important to note that the presence of high - redshift quasi - stellar objects ( qso s ) and galaxies at redshifts @xmath94 indicates that the process of structure formation was already in full swing at that early epoch when the lcdm universe was less than a billion years old .",
    "most models of qso s rely on a central supermassive black hole ( @xmath95 ) to power the quasar luminosity via accretion . since structure forms hierarchically in the cold dark matter scenario , the presence of such supermassive black holes at high redshift suggest that they formed through an assembly mechanism involving either accretion or mergers or both .",
    "it is not clear whether either of these processes is efficient enough to assemble a large number of high - redshift qso s in a lcdm cosmology @xcite .",
    "( at the time of writing , over 400 quasi - stellar objects with redshifts @xmath96 have been reported in the literature . ) in addition , it is interesting to note the discovery of an `` old '' quasar apm  08279 + 5255 at redshift @xmath97 , which appears to have an older age ( 2.1  gyr ) than the lcdm model ( at that redshift ) and may , therefore , be problematic for concordance cosmology as well as several other dark - energy models @xcite .",
    "since brane2 can be considerably older than lcdm , this makes it easier to account for the existence of apm  08279 + 5255 within the braneworld context than in lcdm .",
    "( we shall return to this issue in a companion paper . )",
    "another `` surprise '' for the concordance cosmology emerges from the wmap data which suggest that the optical depth to reionization is @xmath98 . for the lcdm model ,",
    "this translates into a rather high redshift of reionization @xmath99 @xcite , suggesting that population  iii stars and/or mini - qso s were already in place at @xmath100 in order to have efficiently reionized the universe .",
    "whether both the structure - assembly issue and the high reionization redshift can be successfully accommodated within the lcdm paradigm remains to be seen @xcite .",
    "however , both issues are important enough to compel the serious theorist to look for alternative models which , while preserving the manifold strengths and successes of the lcdm model at low @xmath4 , will also be able to flexibly accommodate the striking properties of the universe at higher redshifts . as we have demonstrated in this paper , braneworld cosmology may successfully alleviate some of the tension currently existing between theory and observations at moderate redshifts , while allowing the universe to be `` lcdm - like '' at the present epoch .",
    "the effective equation of state ( solid line ) and the deceleration parameter ( dashed line ) of the brane2 model are shown .",
    "( the dotted line shows @xmath101 which describes the lcdm model . )",
    "the mimicry redshift ( [ eq : new1 ] ) is @xmath102 so that @xmath84 at @xmath103 .",

    "[ fig : state ] .",

    ", we use the braneworld theory as our model with @xmath48 defined in ( [ omegas ] ) , and the effective equation of state ( [ eq : state0 ] ) is then _ redshift - dependent _ even during the mimicry period when @xmath106 . a theorist who is unaware of the possibility of cosmic mimicry , when reconstructing the cosmic equation of state from ( [ eq : state0 ] ) with @xmath82 in the place of @xmath48 , will arrive at a different conclusion that @xmath107 .",
    "this example demonstrates some of the pitfalls associated with the cosmological reconstruction of the equation of state , which depends on the underlying theoretical model and for which an accurate knowledge of @xmath48 is essential ; see @xcite for a discussion of related issues .    in concluding this section",
    ", we would like to mention an additional important consequence of braneworld cosmology , namely that the departure of the brane hubble parameter from its lcdm counterpart is likely to affect the growth of density perturbations . from the linearized perturbation equation + 2h - 4g|  = 0 , [ eq : delta ] where @xmath108 is the relative density perturbation",
    ", it follows that a large value of @xmath109 will , via the second term on the left - hand side , dampen the growth of perturbations , while a small value of @xmath109 should hasten their growth .",
    "although this argument is also likely to carry over to the braneworld , the direct application of ( [ eq : delta ] ) to the study of gravitational instability ( as well as cmb anisotropy ) should be treated with some caution since ( [ eq : delta ] ) was derived within the general - relativistic framework , and it is likely to require some modification before it can be applied to the study of cosmological perturbations on the brane . indeed , according to the analysis of @xcite , the linearized equation describing the evolution of inhomogeneities in the braneworld models of dvali  gabadadze  porrati ( dgp ) type @xcite , corresponding to @xmath110 , on spatial scales much shorter than @xmath31 has the form @xmath111 where the time - dependent parameter @xmath112 is given by @xcite @xmath113    another equation which might possibly describe the behaviour of density perturbations in the braneworld models under consideration in this paper will be discussed in the next section .",
    "here , we would like to discuss the results of the previous section in the light of some generic properties of braneworld gravity .",
    "cosmology determined by action ( [ action ] ) has two important scales , namely , the length scale ( [ ell ] ) @xmath114 which describes the interplay between the bulk and brane gravity , and the momentum scale @xmath115 which determines the role of the brane tension in the dynamics of the brane . in a model characterized by the randall  sundrum constraint @xcite @xmath116 the absolute value of @xmath117 is equal to the inverse warping length @xmath118 of the randall  sundrum solution .",

    "thus , we can expect that , in the neighbourhood of the source , on distances smaller than @xmath171 given by ( [ scale ] ) , the solution is determined mainly by the quadratic part @xmath130 in eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) , which means that it respects the `` bare '' einstein equation @xmath172 to a high precision .",
    "this effect is sometimes described as the `` gravity filter '' of the dgp model @xcite , which screens the scalar graviton in the neighbourhood of the source making the gravity effectively einsteinian .",
    "some aspects of this interesting phenomenon are discussed in recent papers @xcite .    expression ( [ scale ] ) generalizes the length scale @xcite of the dgp model , below which nonlinear effects become important , to the case of nonzero brane tension ( nonzero @xmath140 ) and bulk cosmological constant satisfying the rs constraint ( [ lambda - rs ] ) .",
    "the observable gravitational constant on scales much smaller than @xmath171 will be given by @xmath173 for the sun , the scale @xmath171 is estimated as @xmath174 which , for interesting values of @xmath140 and @xmath175 , will be very large .",
    "the corresponding radius for the earth is smaller only by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this , however , is not the full story . as argued in @xcite , the gravitational potential of a spherically symmetric body on scales @xmath176",
    "is corrected by the cosmological expansion . moreover",
    ", the critical scale @xmath171 becomes dependent on the value of the hubble parameter , and can be different from ( [ scale ] ) for values of @xmath31 of the order of the hubble length .",
    "another effective gravitational constant appears in the equation for the growth of cosmological perturbations on the above - mentioned scales , as was mentioned in the previous section [ see eqs .",
    "( [ perturb ] ) and ( [ betastar ] ) ] .",
    "however , we note that , in this paper , interesting values of the parameter @xmath31 are smaller than the hubble length since we would like relation ( [ eq : mimic0 ] ) to be satisfied for reasonably high redshifts , and this condition implies that the parameter @xmath175 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ omegas ] ) , is significantly larger than unity .",
    "consequently , the critical scale @xmath171 is given by eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) .",
    "note that gravity on scales @xmath177 , although close to einstein gravity , is not exactly einsteinian , and these deviations can be used to test braneworld theory on solar - system scales @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the distance scale @xmath171 given by ( [ scale ] ) can also be justified by using an argument from cosmology .",
    "imagine the central body to be formed of pressureless matter and to represent a part of the homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "then the solution inside this body is uniquely described by the cosmological equations of sec .",
    "[ mimicry ] . as the density parameter of the body exceeds the right - hand side of ( [ eq : mimic0 ] ) , its gravitational evolution",
    "is effectively governed by the `` bare '' einstein equation @xmath178 .",
    "the relevant condition describing this case is the inequality opposite to ( [ eq : mimic0 ] ) ; it can be written in terms of the density @xmath164 as @xmath179 which , in view of relations ( [ albeta ] ) and ( [ alphabeta ] ) , essentially coincides with condition ( [ scale ] ) .    although the preceding reasoning is applicable to both the positive - tension and the negative - tension brane , the current understanding of the braneworld gravitational physics supports only the positive - tension case ( which corresponds to brane1 model in this paper ) , while the situation with the negative - tension brane remains unclear ( at least , to the authors of this paper ) . from eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) , one might expect that a negative - tension brane will show reasonable physical behaviour in the case @xmath180 ( note that @xmath181 for a negative - tension brane ) , in which the gravitational constant ( [ g - eff ] ) is positive .",
    "however , direct calculation ( along the lines of @xcite ) _ in the two - brane model _ with the rs constraint ( [ lambda - rs ] ) shows that , in this case , the gravitational interaction between material bodies on large scales is dominated by the ghost - like radion , with the effective gravitational coupling @xmath182 where @xmath5 is given by the same expression ( [ g - eff ] ) .",
    "the radion - dominated gravity on these scales is formally attractive in the case @xmath183 , and is repulsive for @xmath184 .",
    "however , on smaller spatial scales @xmath185 , newton s law similar to ( [ small - scale ] ) is reproduced with the gravitational constant given by ( [ g - tilde ] ) , which is positive if @xmath186 .",
    "the gravity on these scales is of scalar  tensor character . on still smaller distances from the central source , @xmath187",
    ", the theory may approach einstein gravity with the effective gravitational constant ( [ g - obs ] ) .",
    "however , all these expectations remain to be verified by more refined calculations which generalize to the braneworld models of interest to us in this paper , including those with negative tension and without the rs constraint ( [ lambda - rs ] ) . in the following subsection",
    ", we propose a different approach to this problem , based on alternative boundary conditions in the brane  bulk system .",
    "many papers ( see , e.g. , the recent review @xcite ) have stressed that equation ( [ effective ] ) is not closed on the brane in the sense that it contains the symmetric traceless tensor @xmath147 whose behaviour on the brane is not determined by the dynamics of matter alone . as of now , this `` nonclosure '' of the equations on the brane constitutes one of the major problems confronting braneworld theory .",
    "some additional information from the bulk is needed to determine the observable braneworld dynamics completely ; one can say that some _ boundary conditions _ are to be specified to restrict the class of possible braneworld solutions .",
    "usually , one tends to specify the `` physical '' boundary conditions somewhere in the bulk , by requiring the bulk to be singularity - free ( see @xcite ) and/or by introducing one or more ( regulatory ) branes in the bulk .",
    "however , it seems to be difficult to implement this proposal in practice in a fully nonlinear theory , and it thus remains unclear whether such proposals will lead to a reasonable theory at all . a more practical approach to this problem , adopted in many papers ( see ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) , consists in making some reasonable assumptions about the tensor @xmath147 on the brane . here",
    ", we make a proposal to take this approach as a way of specifying the boundary conditions in the brane - bulk system .",
    "the proposal consists in specifying the boundary conditions on the brane , rather than in the bulk , in such a way as to close equation ( [ effective ] ) .    of all possible versions of boundary conditions of this kind",
    ", the simplest one appears to consist in setting @xmath188 on the brane .",
    "this condition is very often imposed in practical calculations by neglecting the contribution of this term in various situations . here",
    ", we do not discuss the physical meaning of this proposal in all detail but only consider its consequences very briefly .    with the specification of the boundary condition in the form ( [ bc ] ) , equation ( [ effective ] ) becomes a closed four - dimensional equation on the brane completely determining its dynamics , and solution in the bulk becomes of no crucial importance for an observer on the brane .",
    "note that the specification ( [ bc ] ) preserves all homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions with the only restriction that the dark radiation is zero , i.e. , @xmath189 in eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) .",
    "thus we are not losing the cosmological properties of the braneworld models ( except those for which the nonzero value of the dark radiation is crucial @xcite ) ; in particular , the cosmic mimicry phenomenon discussed in this paper remains intact .",
    "the boundary condition under consideration affects only the inhomogeneous gravitational physics .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a spherically symmetric metric in the case ( [ bc ] ) is unique and is the schwarzschild metric in a broad region of parameters of the theory .",
    "thus , in particular , there are no higher - dimensional corrections to the newtonian potential , as is the case in the two - brane model [ see eqs .",
    "( [ large - scale ] ) and ( [ small - scale ] ) ] , and the theory is not `` spoiled '' by the presence of the scalar gravitational degree of freedom . the small - scale gravitational physics in this case has the effective gravitational constant equal to @xmath190 , as in the previous subsection .",
    "( from this viewpoint , the two - brane model discussed in the preceding subsection represents a braneworld model with a different type of boundary condition . )",
    "the linear equations for the cosmological scalar density perturbations in the braneworld model under consideration with the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) were , in fact , recently derived in @xcite .",
    "condition ( [ bc ] ) in @xcite was assumed as a reasonable approximation on sufficiently small spatial scales while , in this paper , we propose to take it as an exact boundary condition .",
    "the equation governing the evolution of the relativistic potential @xmath191 was shown in @xcite to have the form @xmath192 where @xmath193 and the last equality is valid for the case of dust .",
    "as in the discussion in the end of the previous section , again the only change is the appearance of a time - dependent effective gravitational constant . equation ( [ scalar ] ) was used to test the theory against cmb observations in @xcite .",
    "we note that the proposal of the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) works here for branes with positive as well as negative tensions and , hopefully , represents one of the ways of combining the attractive features of the mimicry cosmology of the brane2 model with the observable small - scale gravity .",
    "more analysis is required to test this proposal , and we are going to return to this issue in the future publications .",
    "we have shown that braneworld cosmology , for a large region of parameter space , exhibits a property which can be called `` cosmic mimicry . '' during early cosmological epochs , the braneworld behaves like a matter - dominated friedmann universe with the _ usual _ value of the cosmological parameter @xmath1 that would be inferred from observations of the local matter density . at late times",
    ", however , the universe evolves almost exactly like in the lcdm scenario but with a _",
    "renormalized _ value of the cosmological density parameter @xmath54 .",
    "specifically , a positive - tension brane1 model , which at high redshifts expands with density parameter @xmath48 , at lower redshifts mimics the lcdm cosmology with a _ smaller value _ of the density parameter @xmath194 .",
    "a negative - tension brane2 model at low redshifts also mimics lcdm but with a _ larger value _ of the density parameter @xmath57 .",
    "is determined by ( [ lcdm ] ) with the upper ( `` @xmath34 '' ) sign for brane2 and the lower ( `` @xmath35 '' ) sign for brane1 . ]",
    "the transition redshift between the early epoch and the late ( mimicry ) epoch is , in principle , a free parameter which depends upon constants entering the braneworld lagrangian ; see ( [ eq : mimic1 ] ) or ( [ eq : new1 ] ) .",
    "the braneworld models discussed in this paper have interesting cosmological properties .",
    "for instance , in the case of brane1 ( brane2 ) , the universe expands faster ( slower ) than in the lcdm scenario at redshifts greater than the mimicry redshift @xmath66 , whereas , for @xmath93 , @xmath195 in both models .",
    "the smaller value of the hubble parameter at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath196 ) in the case of brane2 leads to an older universe and also to a redshift of reionization which can be significantly lower than @xmath92 inferred for the lcdm model from the wmap data @xcite .",
    "these features , together with the mimicry property , result in an interesting new cosmology which can successfully ameliorate the current tension between the concordance ( lcdm ) cosmology and the high - redshift universe .",
    "the effect of cosmic mimicry and the existence of two asymptotic density parameters @xmath48 and @xmath54 is a consequence of the time - dependence of the effective gravitational constant in braneworld theory @xcite , which can be related to the well known property of the scale - dependence of the effective gravitational constant in braneworld models @xcite . on large spatial scales ,",
    "@xmath197 , the braneworld model with positive brane tension ( brane1 ) exhibits gravity with the renormalized effective gravitational constant ( [ g - eff ] ) , and we showed that this renormalization corresponds to the renormalization of the cosmological density parameter ( [ omega - m ] ) .",
    "the behaviour of the braneworld model with negative brane tension ( brane2 ) on these scales is drastically different : it is dominated by the scalar radion which can even make the gravitational interaction repulsive ; see eq .",
    "( [ g - radion ] ) . ) is unlikely to remedy the situation . ]",
    "the problem of this kind may not arise in models with stabilized radion @xcite or in models with different boundary conditions for the brane  bulk system  but this issue has to be studied separately .",
    "only two effective gravitational constants appear in the cosmology under consideration , given by ( [ g - eff ] ) and ( [ g - obs ] ) , respectively , for low and high energy densities .",
    "however , in the local gravitational physics , there also appears the spatial distance ( [ scale ] ) depending upon the mass of the central source , so that gravity in the range @xmath198 of distances @xmath199 from the source has a different value of the gravitational constant , given by ( [ g - tilde ] ) , and , moreover , typically has a scalar  tensor character manifested , in particular , in ( [ discrep ] ) .",
    "this may be important for the estimates of masses from the dynamics of clusters of galaxies and from gravitational lensing on these scales in the braneworld theory @xcite .    on small distances from the central source , @xmath200 , both positive - tension and negative - tension branes apparently behave similarly reproducing the einstein gravity to a high precision with the gravitational constant @xmath190 , which is the bare gravitational coupling in the braneworld action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "however , this expectation is to be verified by refined calculations in braneworld models with arbitrary sign of brane tension and without the rs constraint ( [ lambda - rs ] ) . in this respect",
    ", we should note that the solution for a spherically symmetric source ( the analog of the schwarzschild and interior solution in general relativity ) largely remains an open problem in braneworld theory ( for recent progress in the dgp model , see @xcite ) .",
    "specification of boundary conditions is of crucial importance for the construction of a specific braneworld model since they determine the inhomogeneous gravitational physics on the brane .",
    "from the general viewpoint , we may regard boundary conditions as any conditions restricting the space of solutions of the brane  bulk system of equations ( [ bulk ] ) , ( [ brane ] ) .",
    "one of the possible proposals in braneworld theory that we put forward in this paper is to specify the boundary conditions on the visible brane , and we discussed one of the simplest such specifications , given by eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) . in this case , the equations of the theory become completely closed on the brane and allow for both positive and negative brane tensions preserving all cosmological properties .",
    "moreover , this proposal might be extended to the braneworld theory with timelike extra dimension preserving its attractive features @xcite but without inheriting its nonphysical properties ( the tachyonic character of the kaluza ",
    "klein gravitational modes ) .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the homogeneous and isotropic braneworld cosmology is uniquely described by eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) and , apart from possible restriction on the dark - radiation constant @xmath28 , is not sensitive to the specification of boundary conditions for system ( [ bulk ] ) , ( [ brane ] ) .",
    "the cosmological model under consideration appears to safely pass the existing constraints on the variation of the gravitational constant from primordial abundances of light elements synthesized in the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the value of the gravitational constant at the bbn epoch in our model coincides with the value measured on small scales ( [ g - obs ] ) , and the effective gravitational constant ( [ g - tilde ] ) or ( [ g - eff ] ) that might affect the large - scale dynamics of the universe responsible for the cmb fluctuations is within the uncertainties estimated in @xcite .    cosmic mimicry in braneworld models",
    "is most efficient in the case of parameter @xmath201 , which , according to ( [ alpha ] ) , implies that the two spatial scales , namely , the brane length scale given by ( [ ell ] ) and the curvature scale of the bulk are of the same order : @xmath202 .",
    "this coincidence of the orders of magnitude of completely independent scales can be regarded as some tuning of parameters , although it is obviously a mild one .",
