    "in condensed matter physics , three common types of degrees of freedom are often found together : atoms positioned in a lattice , spin magnetic moments , and itinerant electrons .",
    "many phenomena primarily involve only one of these and it has therefore proved useful to study them with separate models . here , we are concerned with the spatial degrees of freedom of atoms in a lattice .",
    "the fact that the atoms oscillate about their equilibrium positions is essential for many important phenomena in condensed matter physics .",
    "the question we address is whether one can define the time evolution , consistent with the schrdinger equation , for an infinite assembly of quantum oscillators such as a crystal lattice .",
    "it is natural to start by considering the standard harmonic interaction , which should be an accurate description when the displacements from the equilibrium positions are small .",
    "it is well known , however , that some basic phenomena require that we consider anharmonic perturbations .",
    "our approach applies to multi - body interactions that fall off sufficiently fast but for clarity and space limitations we will restrict ourselves to local and nearest neighbor anharmonicities here and refer to our forthcoming paper for the general case @xcite .",
    "we will also limit the discussion to oscillators organized in a translation - invariant fashion on a lattice . to keep the notation simple",
    "we will work with one - dimensional oscillators at each lattice site , but this is not essential . with some straightforward modifications of the analysis our main result",
    "can be generalized to non - translation invariant models defined on a graph satisfying a few natural assumptions .",
    "let @xmath0 denote a finite subset of the @xmath1-dimensional hypercubic lattice @xmath2 and define hamiltonians @xmath3 as self - adjoint operators on @xmath4 by the following expression @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the canonical momentum and position operators for the oscillator at @xmath9 .",
    "the heisenberg dynamics , @xmath10 , is defined by @xmath11 the algebra of observables is a tensor product @xmath12 such that for @xmath13 , we have @xmath14 , by identifying @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath17 , @xmath18 is well - defined for all @xmath0 containing @xmath19 .",
    "our main concern is the existence of a limiting dynamics : do we have @xmath20 such that @xmath21 in a suitable sense ? for an anharmonic lattice of classical oscillators",
    "a positive answer to this question was obtained by lanford , lebowitz and lieb @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that in the case of quantum spin systems ( i.e. , bounded local hamiltonians ) one can use lieb - robinson bounds to establish the existence of the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the essential observation is as follows .",
    "let @xmath22 be an increasing exhausting sequence of finite volumes with hamiltonians of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "then , for @xmath25 , one easily derives the bound : @xmath26\\vert\\ , ds . \\label{cauchy}\\ ] ] therefore , if we can show that the commutators in the integrand have sufficiently small norms , it will follow that the finite - volume dynamics form a cauchy sequence .",
    "estimates for such commutators were first derived by lieb and robinson @xcite . for @xmath17 and @xmath27",
    ", they proved a bound of the form @xmath28\\vert\\leq c e^{-a(d(x , y)-v\\vert t\\vert)}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are positive constants and @xmath31 denotes the distance between @xmath19 and @xmath32 .",
    "estimates of this type are now commonly referred to as lieb - robinson bounds @xcite . for anharmonic lattice systems lieb - robinson bounds",
    "were recently proved in ref . , and this work builds on the results obtained there .    for the oscillator lattices with @xmath33 , the approach suggested by eq .",
    "[ cauchy ] does not work due to the unboundedness of @xmath34 .",
    "but we note that for the _ harmonic _ lattice , @xmath35 can be calculated explicitly and can also be defined for the infinite lattice .",
    "one then sees , however , that @xmath36 can not converge in norm .",
    "the idea is to consider the infinite anharmonic system as a limit of finite - volume perturbations of the infinite harmonic system .",
    "we mention that , with a different approach , amour , levy - bruhl , and nourrigat have recently obtained convergence results for certain models by introducing suitable sobolev - like norms for the observables @xcite .",
    "rigorous perturbation theory of infinite systems is available if the unperturbed infinite system dynamics has a suitable continuity property @xcite . in our case",
    "this will be continuity for the weak operator topology , which follows from known properties and the exact solution of the harmonic lattice .    up to a redefinition of the parameters , the harmonic lattice model hamiltonian on a finite subset @xmath37 ,",
    "is @xmath38 acting on @xmath39 .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators are defined by @xmath40 which satisfy the canonical commutation relarions ( ccr ) : @xmath41 = [ a_x^ * , a_y^ * ] = 0 \\quad \\mbox{and } \\quad [ a_x , a_y^ * ] = \\delta_{x , y } \\quad \\mbox{for all } x , y \\in \\lambda_l \\,\\ ] ] @xmath3 is a quadratic expression in @xmath42 , which can be diagonalized by a bogoliubov transformation @xcite .",
    "this is usually done in fourier space resulting in : @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45 are creation operators for the eigenmodes of the system , which also satisfy the ccr , and the ground state of @xmath3 is the corresponding vacuum .",
    "the time evolution is simply given by @xmath46 .",
    "it is useful for us to express the bogoliubov transformations in real space : for each @xmath47 , set @xmath48 and similarly for the @xmath49 s .",
    "then , there are real - linear operators @xmath50 and @xmath51 such that @xmath52 using these relations , one finds a one - parameter group , @xmath53 , such that @xmath54 since the canonical operators ( @xmath55 s , @xmath56 s , @xmath57 s , @xmath58 s , ... ) are all unbounded , we will derive lieb - robinson bounds for the weyl operators instead : @xmath59 \\ , , \\ ] ] this can be done very explicitly by using the relations @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "observe that @xmath62   & = & \\left\\ { w ( t_t f ) - w(g ) w ( t_tf ) w(-g ) \\right\\ } w(g )   \\\\ & = & \\left\\ { 1 - e^{-2i \\sigma ( t_tf , g ) } \\right\\ } w ( t_tf ) w(g ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the weyl operators are unitary , we therefore have @xmath63   \\right\\| \\leq 2\\vert",
    "\\sigma(t_t f , g)\\vert$ ] .",
    "so , all we have to do is to estimate @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 is explicitly given by @xmath66 , where the functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 are given by @xmath69   + { \\rm re } [   \\frac{1}{| \\lambda_l| } \\sum_{k \\in \\lambda_l^ * } e^{ik \\cdot x - 2i \\gamma(k ) t } \\ , ] \\\\",

    "we have well - defined hamiltonian such that @xmath89 @xmath20 is the dynamics for the formal hamiltonian @xmath90 and the lieb - robinson bounds continue to hold .    for simplicity , consider the perturbation of the form @xmath91 .",
