    "the study of the stability and the properties of matter - antimatter molecules has a long history , starting with the pioneering work of wheeler who suggested in 1946 that @xmath15 might be bound with its antimatter partner to form a matter - antimatter molecule @xcite .",
    "since then , the problem has been examined theoretically by many workers @xcite ( for a review and other references see @xcite ) .",
    "wheeler went on to explore the properties of an assembly of @xmath16 atoms and molecules if they were made , and he outlined the phase boundaries in temperature and pressure separating various phases of @xmath15 atoms and @xmath15-@xmath17 molecules in their gaseous , liquid , super - fluid , crystal , and metallic states @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental detection of matter - antimatter molecules is difficult , and the @xmath15-@xmath17 molecule was successfully detected only recently , as late as 2007 @xcite .    in spite of extensive past investigations ,",
    "our knowledge of matter - antimatter molecules remains rather incomplete , being limited to @xmath18 and some aspects of @xmath19-@xmath20 .",
    "there are however stable and meta - stable charged particles and antiparticles , such as @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , etc .",
    "the conditions for the molecular binding of four - body particle - antiparticle complexes containing these charged constituents are not known , nor are their annihilation lifetimes , if these matter - antimatter molecules turn out to be bound .    with the advent of the relativistic heavy - ion collider at brookhaven and the large hadron collider at cern ,",
    "a large number of charged particles and antiparticles are produced in high - energy @xmath27 and heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the production of matter and antimatter particles in close space - time proximity raises the interesting question whether chance encounters of some of the produced charged particles and antiparticles may lead to the formation of matter - antimatter molecules as debris of the collision .",
    "the detection of matter - antimatter molecules in high - energy nuclear collisions will need to overcome the difficulty of large combinatorial background noises that may be present . in another related area , recent production and trapping of cold antihydrogen",
    "@xcite provide the possibility of bringing matter and antimatter atoms close together .",
    "furthermore , electron - positron colliders with fine energy resolutions may be used to produce stable matter - antimatter molecules as resonances with finite widths , when the colliding @xmath28 and @xmath29 combination has the same quantum number as the matter - antimatter molecules .",
    "the detection of new matter - antimatter molecules is however a difficult task , as evidenced by the long span of time between the proposal and the observation of the @xmath15-@xmath17 molecule . additional instrumentation and experimental apparatus may be needed .",
    "it is nonetheless an interesting theoretical question to investigate systematically the general factors affecting the stability of matter - antimatter molecules , whether any of these matter - antimatter molecules may be bound , and if they are bound , what are their binding energies , annihilation lifetimes , and other characteristics .",
    "answers to these questions will help us assess whether it may ever be feasible to detect them experimentally in the future .",
    "following wheeler @xcite , we shall use the term  atom \" to represent a two - body bound state of a positive and a negative charged pair that can form a building block , out of which more complex  molecules \" can be constructed . in the present work , we shall limit our attention to molecules in which the four constituents @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 consist of two charge conjugate pairs , with @xmath32 the charge conjugate of @xmath31 , and @xmath34 the charge conjugate of @xmath35 . we shall arrange and order the constituents according to their masses such that @xmath35@xmath36@xmath31 , and the charges of @xmath35 and @xmath31 be @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively . to make the problem simple , we shall consider molecules containing non - identical constituents @xmath35 and @xmath31 and their antiparticle counterparts , such that there are no identical particles among the constituents .",
    "molecules with identical constituents require additional considerations on the symmetries of the wave function with respect to the exchange of the pair of identical particles , which are beyond the scope of the present investigation .    to study the structure of the molecules , we shall consider only coulomb interactions between particles and neglect strong interactions , as the range of strong interactions is considerably smaller than the bohr radius of the relevant particle - antiparticle system .",
    "previously , based on the method proposed for the study of molecular states in heavy quark mesons @xcite , we obtained the interatomic potential for the @xmath39 system @xcite .",
    "we shall generalize our consideration to cases of constituent particles of various masses and types and shall quantize the four - body hamiltonian to obtain molecular eigenstates of the four - body system . if molecular states are found , we shall determine their annihilation lifetimes and their spin dependencies , if any .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the subject matter of molecular states appears not only in atomic and molecular physics , but also in nuclear physics and hadron spectroscopy .",
    "wheeler s 1937 article entitled  molecular viewpoints in nuclear structure \" introduced molecular physics concepts such as resonating groups and alpha particle groups to nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "indeed , nucleus - nucleus molecular states have been observed previously in the collision of light nuclei near the coulomb barrier @xcite .",
    "molecular states of heavy - quark mesons have been proposed in high - energy hadron spectroscopy @xcite to explain the narrow 3872 mev state discovered by the belle collaboration @xcite and other collaborations @xcite .",
    "the general stability condition established here for the coulomb four - body problem for matter - antimatter molecules may have interesting implications or generalizations in other branches of physics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the families of states of the four - body matter - antimatter system so as to introduce the method of our investigation . in section iii , the mathematical details of our formulation are presented and the four - body problem is reduced to a simple two - body problem in terms of the interaction of two atoms with residual interactions .",
    "the interaction potential is found to consist of the sum of the direct potential @xmath40 and the polarization potential @xmath41 . in section iv , we show how to evaluate the interaction matrix elements . in section v , we show the analytical result for the direct potential @xmath40 . in section vi , the polarization potential is evaluated for the virtual excitation to the complete set of bound and continuum atomic states .",
    "the results of the interaction potential for @xmath42-@xmath20 are discussed in section vii .",
    "the interaction potentials for other molecular systems are examined in section viii . in section ix ,",
    "we solve the schr \" odinger equation for molecular motion and obtain the molecular eigenstates for different systems .",
    "we discuss the annihilation rates and lifetimes of the molecular states in section x. finally , section xi gives some discussions and conclusions of the present work .",
    "some of the details of the analytical results are presented in the appendix .",
    "the four constituent particles can be arranged in different ways leading to different types of states .",
    "there is the @xmath43 family of states of the type @xmath44-@xmath45 , in which @xmath46 and @xmath47 orbit around each other to form the @xmath48 atom in the @xmath49 state , while @xmath50 and @xmath51 orbit around each other to form the @xmath52 atom in the @xmath53 state .",
    "when @xmath54 and @xmath55 are separated at large distances , their asymptotic state energy is @xmath56 there is another @xmath57 family of states of the type @xmath58-@xmath59 , in which @xmath46 and @xmath51 orbit around each other to form the @xmath60 atom in the @xmath49 state , while @xmath61 and @xmath47 orbit around each other to form the @xmath62 atom in the @xmath63 state .",
    "their asymptotic state energy is @xmath64 for the same values of @xmath65 , the asymptotic state of the @xmath66 family lies lower in energy than the asymptotic state of the @xmath67 family , except when @xmath68 for which they are at the same level , @xmath69 on the other hand , by varying the principal quantum numbers , many of the asymptotic states of one family can lie close to the energy levels of the asymptotic states of the other family .",
    "level crossing between states and the mixing of states of different families can occur when the atoms are brought in close proximity to each other .",
    "there are two different methods to study molecular states . in the first method ,",
    "one reduces the four - body problem into a simpler two - body problem .",
    "one breaks up the four - body hamiltonian into the unperturbed hamiltonians of two atoms , plus residual interactions and the kinetic energies of the atoms .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonians of the two atoms can be solved exactly . using the atomic states as separable two - body basis , one constructs molecular states with the atoms as simple building blocks and quantize the four - particle hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the quantized eigenstate obtained in such a method may not necessarily contain all the correlations",
    ". they may also not necessarily be the lowest states of the four - body system .",
    "they however have the advantage that the center - of - mass motion of the composite atoms are properly treated and the formulation can be applied to systems with vastly different mass ratios @xmath1 .",
    "they provide a clear and simple picture of the molecular structure .",
    "they also provide vital information on the condition of molecular stability and the values of molecular eigenenergies .",
    "the knowledge of the molecular eigenfunctions provides information on other properties of the molecular states and their annihilation lifetimes .",
    "furthermore , these molecular states can form doorways for states of greater complexity with additional correlations .",
    "for example , one can multiply the four - body wave functions of a molecular state obtained in such a method ( see eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) below ) by a complete set of correlated wave functions for a particular pair of constituents , and diagonalize the four - body hamiltonian with such a basis .",
    "the eigenstates obtained after such a diagonalization represent the splitting of the doorway state into finer molecular states containing additional correlations . as the method exhibits a clear molecular structure in terms of composite two - body objects ,",
    "its asymptotic states illustrate how the molecule may be formed by the collision of the composite atoms . finally , if one depicts the orbiting of one particle relative to another particle as a `` dance pattern '' with the topology of a ring , then the dance patterns of the different constituents and atoms in different families have distinctly different connectivities and topological structures",
    ". the transition of a state from one family to another family will involve the breaking of one type of dance pattern and re - establishing another type of dance pattern .",
    "it is reasonable to conjecture that their distinct topological structures may suppress the transition amplitude between families and may allow the atoms to retain some of their characteristics and stability in their dynamical motion and transitions .",
    "there is an alternative second method to study the molecular states by taking the interaction potential to be the adiabatic potential obtained in a variational calculation for the lowest - energy state of the four particle complex in the born - oppenheimer potential , in which the positions of two heavy constituents are held fixed @xcite .",
    "it should be realized that such variational calculations have not yet been fully variational . by fixing the positions of the heavy constituents ( the proton and antiproton in the case of the @xmath70 complex ) ,",
    "the trial wave functions of the heavy constituents have been constrained to be delta functions without variations .",
    "if the motion of the heavy constituents were allowed to vary in a fully variational calculation , the lowest energy state would be the one in which the heavy constituents would orbit around each other in their atomic orbitals , with binding energies proportional to their heavy masses .",
    "the variational calculations of the higher molecular states will need to insure the orthogonality of the state relative to lower lying ones .",
    "furthermore , as the variational calculation searches for the state with the lowest energy , motion in the relative coordinates between the heavier masses corresponds to constraining a trajectory along a path with adiabatic transitions whenever a level crossing occurs . in a collective molecular motion ,",
    "these level crossing may not necessarily be adiabatic @xcite because the speed of the collective motion becomes large at small interatomic separations , and the transition matrix element between different families may be suppressed due to the difference in their topological structures .",
    "it is reasonable to suggest that while variational calculations may provide useful information on the four - particle complex , they should not be the only method to examine the molecular structure of the four - body system .",
    "we shall use the first method to study the eigenstates of the four - body system and construct states built on the @xmath67 family .",
    "accordingly , we break the four - body hamiltonian into a part containing the unperturbed hamiltonians of the @xmath71 and @xmath72 atoms and another part containing the residual interactions and the kinetic energies of @xmath71 and @xmath73 .",
    "the quantization of the four - body hamiltonian then gives the molecular states of interest , as in a previous study of molecular states in heavy mesons in hadron physics @xcite .",
    "such a separation of the four - body hamiltonian is justified because the composite @xmath71 and @xmath73 atoms are neutral objects , and their residual interaction @xmath74 between the constituents of @xmath71 and @xmath73 involve many cancellations . as a consequence ,",
    "the non - diagonal matrix element for excitation arising from the residual interaction is relatively small in comparison with the difference between unperturbed state energies , and the perturbation expansion is expected to converge .",
    "molecular states can be constructed using composite objects of @xmath54 and @xmath55 in various asymptotic @xmath49 and @xmath63 states .",
    "we shall be interested in molecular states in which the building block atoms @xmath75 and @xmath76 are in their ground states at asymptotic separations . as the two ground state atoms approach each other , they will be excited and polarized and their virtual excitation will lead to an interaction potential between the atoms , from which the eigenstates of the molecule will be determined .",
    "molecular states constructed with excited @xmath77 and @xmath78 atoms can be similarly considered in a simple generalization in the future .",
    "such a possibility brings into focus the richness of states in the four - body system , as the molecular states will have different interatomic interactions , obey different stability conditions , and have different properties with regard to annihilation and production .",
    "in order to introduce relevant concepts and notations , we shall review the formulation of the four - body problem in terms of a simpler two - body problem @xcite .",
    "we choose the four - body coordinate system as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and label constituents @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 as particles 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively with @xmath35@xmath36@xmath31 . the hamiltonian for the four - particle system is @xmath81 in which particle @xmath82 has a momentum @xmath83 and a rest mass @xmath84 .",

    "the coulomb four - body system in atomic units of @xmath71 and @xmath73 atoms is completely characterized by @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , two different four - body systems with the same @xmath1 will have the same molecular state eigenenergies and eigenfunctions in atomic units .",
    "we can infer the stability of a molecule by studying the change of the molecular eigenenergies as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the effective reduced mass of @xmath141-@xmath142 for molecular motion is large when @xmath143 and decreases as @xmath1 approaches unity .",
    "the relative importance of the direct and polarization potential also changes with @xmath1 . for a matter - antimatter molecule with @xmath144 , we find that the direct potential dominates in regions of @xmath145 and gives rise to deeply bound molecular states .",
    "as @xmath1 approaches unity , the magnitude of @xmath40 decreases and the polarization potential by itself is too weak to hold a bound state . as a consequence , the state energies ( in atomic units ) rises and comes up to the continuum as @xmath1 approaches the unity limit .",
    "we find that matter - antimatter molecules possess bound states if @xmath1 is greater than about 4 .",
    "this stability condition suggests that the binding of matter - antimatter molecules is a rather common phenomenon .",
    "this molecular stability condition is satisfied , and many bound molecular states of different quantum numbers are found , in many four - body systems : @xmath2-@xmath3 , @xmath4-@xmath5 , @xmath6-@xmath7 , @xmath8-@xmath146 , @xmath10-@xmath147 , and @xmath12-@xmath13 .",

    "relative to two @xmath15 atoms @xcite .",
    "it should however be realized that the stability condition we have obtained applies to four - body systems with distinguishable constituents without identical particles . for systems with identical particles such as the @xmath151 system ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account the antisymmetry of the many body wave function with respect to the exchange of the pair of identical particles .",
    "depending on the spin symmetry of the identical particle pair in question , the symmetry or antisymmetry with respect to the spatial exchange of the pair will lead to a lowering or raising of the energy of the state .",

    "their spatial symmetry lowers the state energy relative to the state energy when there is no such a symmetry .",
    "the small value of the theoretical binding energy ( 0.016 a.u .",
    "@xcite ) suggests the occurrence of such a lowering of the energy from the unbound to the bound energy region . in order to confirm this suggestion",

    "how the additional symmetry considerations may modify the stability of those molecules with identical particles is worthy of future investigations .",
    "the states we have obtained may not contain all the correlations .",
    "additional correlations may be included by adding correlation factors and using the solution of the present investigation as doorway states .",
    "future addition of correlations superimposing on the states we have obtained will be of interest .",
    "we can divide the annihilation lifetimes of matter - antimatter molecules into different groups that correlate with the types of constituents .",
    "those molecules constructed from different leptons have the longest annihilation lifetimes , of the order of @xmath152-@xmath135 sec , depending on the spins of the molecular state .",
    "the second group involves leptons and pions in which the pions can not annihilate through strong interactions and can annihilate only through the electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the annihilation lifetimes are of order @xmath134-@xmath135 sec .",
    "molecular states containing kaons have annihilation lifetimes of order @xmath153-@xmath154 sec while those containing proton and antiproton @xmath132-@xmath133 sec .",
    "the relatively long annihilation lifetimes for leptonic @xmath2-@xmath3 molecules may make them accessible for experimental detection .    we have examined only molecular states constructed from the @xmath67 family in which the building - block atoms @xmath75 and @xmath76 are in their ground states .",
    "we can likewise construct in future work states in the @xmath67 family in which @xmath71 and @xmath73 are in their excited states .",
    "these states will have different interatomic interactions , obey different stability conditions , and have different properties with regard to annihilation and production . in another future direction of extension , we can also construct molecular states based on the @xmath57 family , using states of @xmath155 and @xmath156 as building blocks . the @xmath157 molecular states and the @xmath158 molecular states have different topological structures and properties . molecular states built on different branches of the family tree will likely retain some of their family characteristics .",
    "these possibilities bring into focus the rich degrees of freedom and the vast varieties of states that need to be sorted out in the coulomb four - body problem associated with matter - antimatter molecules .",
    "in addition to the problem of molecular states as a structure problem investigated here , future theoretical and experimental studies should also be directed to the question of production and detection methods from reaction points of view . while the observation of new matter - antimatter molecules may be a difficult task ,",
    "the prospect of classifying the @xmath159 system into the genealogy of families and basic building blocks , if it is at all possible , will bring us to a better understanding of the complexity of the spectrum that is associated with the complicated four - body problem opened up by the pioneering work of wheeler @xcite .",
