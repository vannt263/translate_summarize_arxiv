    "the imaging atmospheric cherenkov technique is the primary method for observations of very high energy ( @xmath1100  gev ) @xmath2-rays . in this technique @xmath2-rays",
    "are detected indirectly via the cherenkov light emitted by the charged particles of the induced air - shower .",
    "images of the shower in one or several telescopes are analysed to provide background suppression and to reconstruct primary @xmath2-ray parameters .",
    "the h.e.s.s .",
    "( high energy stereoscopic system ) detector @xcite consists of four telescopes located in namibia at 1800 meters altitude .",
    "each telescope is composed of a 107  @xmath0 mirror @xcite and a camera whose field of view is 5@xmath3  in diameter .",
    "the camera focal plane is covered by 960 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) with 0.16@xmath3  angular extent . to decrease the camera read - out window and the level of noise , very compact electronics located just behind the pmts",
    "is used ( see @xcite for a short description ) . the first h.e.s.s .",
    "telescope has been operating since july 2002 and the system was completed in december 2003 .",
    "it is essential for the extraction of parameters characterizing the air - shower images based on the raw pmt   data to calibrate accurately the pmts  and the electronic response .",
    "the calibration scheme described below is based in part on techniques developed for the cat detector @xcite , the durham  mark  6 detector @xcite and the hegra detector @xcite .",
    "the parameters used in the calibration of the h.e.s.s .",
    "cameras and the methods used to derive them are described below .",
    "results on the stability of photomultiplier gain and overall telescope efficiency are also described .",
    "the electronics of the cameras of the h.e.s.s .  system are divided into two parts : the front - end electronics in 16-pixel _ drawers _ and the back - end electronics in a crate at the rear of the camera .",
    "each of the 60 drawers in a camera contains 16 pmts  and associated acquisition and local trigger electronic cards .",
    "the analogue signals are digitised in the drawers and then the digital signals are sent to the acquisition crate .",
    "data are sent to the central data acquisition system via an optical fibre .",
    "the connection to the array trigger is via an additional optical fibre .",
    "each drawer ( @xmath4 pixels , see figure  [ fig : drawer ] ) is composed of two acquisition cards , each reading the data from @xmath5 pmts , as shown in figure  [ fig : acquisitionchannels ] . for each pixel",
    ", there are three channels , one trigger channel and two acquisition channels with different gains : the high - gain ( hg ) channel is used to detect signal charges up to @xmath6 photoelectrons ( p.e . ) ; the low - gain ( lg ) channel is used to cover the range from @xmath7 to @xmath8 photoelectrons .",
    "figure  [ fig : dynamicrange ] illustrates the linear range used for analysis for both channels .",
    "the pmt  signal is measured across a resistor @xmath9 and amplified into the two acquisition channels ( hg and lg ) .",
    "the analogue signal is then sampled in an analogue ring sampler ( ars ) initially developed by the cea for the antares experiment @xcite .",
    "the sampling is performed at a rate of @xmath10 ghz ; the analogue voltage levels are stored in a ring buffer consisting of @xmath11 capacitor cells . following a trigger signal ,",
    "the sampling is stopped , the capacitor cells are addressed one by one , their analogue signals are impedance matched and a multiplexor distributes the signal from @xmath12 arss  ( @xmath5 pmts ) into one analogue to digital converter ( adc ) with a conversion factor @xmath13 of @xmath14 mv/(adc  count).only @xmath15 ( for normal observations set to 16 ) cells are converted into charge equivalent adc counts , in the range where the cherenkov signal is expected on the basis of the trigger timing . the section  [ timing ] describes how this timing is calibrated .",
    "the digitised signals are stored and processed in a field - programmable gate array ( fpga ) on each acquisition card . in the normal read - out mode ( _ charge mode _ ) , the @xmath15 samples are summed to give two adc  values per pixel ( hg and lg ) .",
    "data from the drawers are sent to 8 fifo memories located in a cpci ( compact peripheral component interface ) crate to be read back by the cpu .",
    "the high - gain channel is sensitive to single photoelectrons : the number of adc  counts between the pedestal and the signal from a single photoelectron is set to be @xmath16 adc  counts ( for a pmt  gain of @xmath17 ) .",
    "this value is chosen such that the single photoelectron peak can be clearly distinguished at normal pixel operating high voltage ( hv ) .",
    "the electronic noise of the system is such that the pedestal width is typically 20% of a photoelectron ( @xmath18 adc  counts rms ) .",
    "the low electronic noise and good sampling allow a precise gain calibration of every pixel .",
    "in addition to the acquisition cards , a drawer contains a number of monitoring functions including three temperatures sensors , as well as individual high voltage supplies for each channel , which are controlled by the control / interface board .",
    "the high voltage supplies are dc - dc converters with active regulation for the cathode ( on negative high voltage ) and the four last dynodes",
    ". the high voltage is set via an analogue level supplied by the control board , and is adjusted to provide a uniform pmt  gain across the camera . in order to minimise transit time differences between pmts  caused by the different high voltages applied",
    ", pmts  were sorted into drawers and cameras according to their gain .",
    "a high voltage divider and adc  allows the actual high voltage to be read back . in order to monitor pixel performance and to identify pixels receiving light from stars , both",
    "the total current provided by the high voltage supply to the pmt  and the divider chain ( `` hvi '' ) as well as the dc anode current ( `` dci '' ) are monitored .",
    "the `` dci '' current depends on the pmt   illumination and the electronic chain offset .",
    "standard cherenkov analysis use as a starting point the signal amplitude of each pixel .",
    "the amplitude is the charge in p.e",
    ". induced by light on the pmt , this charge being corrected by the relative efficiency of this pixel compared to the mean value over the camera ( `` flat - fielding '' , see section  [ ff ] ) .",
    "the calibration provides the required conversion coefficients from adc  counts to corrected photoelectrons .    for each event ,",
    "adc  counts are measured in both channels , @xmath19 for the high gain channel and @xmath20 for the low gain channel .",
    "the calculation of the amplitude in photoelectrons received by every pixel is , for both channels : @xmath21 where ,    * @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the adc  position of the base - line for both channels , which are the _ pedestal _ positions , * @xmath24 is the gain of the high gain channel in adc  counts per p.e . , * @xmath25 is the amplification ratio of the high gain to the low gain , * and @xmath26 is the flat - field coefficient .",
    "the flat - field coefficient corrects for different optical and quantum efficiencies between pixels within a camera .    for the image analysis , @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "are used to provide a single pixel amplitude . provided that both gain channels function properly , the hg value alone is used up to @xmath29  p.e",
    "( see figure  [ fig : dynamicrange ] ) and the lg value beyond @xmath30  p.e . for intermediate values , a weighted average of the hg and lg values",
    "is used and the amplitude is given by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 .    to conclude , for both channels of every pixel , the calibration must provide the pedestal positions , the high gain @xmath24 , and the ratio of the high gain to the low gain . as the flat - fielding coefficients do not depend on the electronics , they are calculated per pixel and not per ( hg or lg ) channel as will be seen later ( see section  [ ff ] ) .",
    "it is also essential that any non - operational channels or pixels are identified in the calibration process in order to avoid miscalculation of amplitudes .",
    "a time window containing only @xmath33 cells ( from the 128 available ) is read from the ars  ( see section [ electronic ] ) . these cells",
    "are selected as follow .",
    "when the reading command is received , the ars  stops sampling and the first cell of the readout window is the @xmath34 sample in the past from the latest filled sample in the circular buffer .",
    "@xmath35 is the time between the moment the signal is received by the pixel and the moment the trigger signal comes back to the drawer .",
    "the @xmath35 value has then to be calibrated in order that the cherenkov signal integrated over the @xmath33 cells is maximised .",
    "the position of the readout window ( the @xmath35 value ) is verified frequently using the _ sample mode _ facility of the arss . in this mode , the charge of the @xmath33 cells ( each of 1  ns ) is read and stored .",
    "the pulse shape can be then studied , as well as the readout timing .",
    "the position of the charge peak in the readout window is used to adjust the timing .",
    "figure  [ fig : sample ] gives an example of data from a _ sample mode _ run made with air - shower events .",
    "the electronic noise in each cell , obtained using events which do not contain contributions due to cherenkov light , is subtracted to extract the pulse shape .",
    "they are averaged over the hg channel for each telescope . from the ars  sample mode ,",
    "the accuracy of timing of the readout window is about 1  ns .",
    "the pedestal position is defined as the mean adc  value recorded in the absence of any cherenkov light .    in the dark , electronic noise creates a narrow gaussian adc  distribution whose mean is the pedestal position .",
    "however , the pedestal position has some dependence on camera temperature , which varies between @xmath36c and @xmath37c depending on the season and the weather .",
    "the typical temperature variation during a run is of the order of @xmath38c .",
    "the pedestals must therefore be calculated for all channels during time - slices as short as possible to minimise the impact of pedestal drift due to temperature variations in the electronics .    during observations ,",
    "the pixels are illuminated by night - sky background ( nsb ) photons , greatly increasing the pedestal width .",
    "there is over 1  p.e .",
    "of nsb  per readout window in normal operation . due to the capacitive coupling of the pmt  signals to the ars  ( see figure  [ fig : acquisitionchannels ] ) the pedestal position remains constant in the usual nsb  range in namibia .",
    "the mean pedestal position therefore corresponds to the position in adc  counts of zero photoelectrons of cherenkov light .      to measure precisely the electronic noise in all channels , adc  distributions",
    "are taken in the absence of background light .",
    "the lids of all cameras are closed and the adc  distributions are randomly measured by software triggering of the cameras when the internal camera temperature is stable .    the resulting pedestal is determined by the base - line voltage of the electronic channels at the input of the adc .",
    "these base - lines are approximately @xmath39 v for both channels , corresponding to @xmath40 adc  counts . in _",
    "charge mode _ , after the summation of the @xmath4 samples , the adc  counts are then @xmath41 adc  counts : this is the typical electronic pedestal position .",
    "measured pedestals lie in the range from -13000 to -11000 adc  counts .",
    "random noise from pmts  and from electronic components is responsible for the pedestal width ( see figure  [ fig : elecped ] ) .",
    "the noise at the input of the adc  is about @xmath42 in the high - gain channel , which gives a pedestal rms  of @xmath4 adc  counts or about 0.2 p.e . , and @xmath43 in the low - gain channel , which gives a pedestal rms  of @xmath44 adc  counts or about 1 p.e .",
    "+    runs taken with the camera lids closed can also be used to measure the drift of pedestal values with temperature using the temperature sensors mounted at three positions in every drawer .",
    "the dark pedestal position is correlated with temperature .",
    "the overall behaviour is a decreasing pedestal position for increasing temperature .",
    "as the shift can be as large as -50 adc  counts / degree , pedestal positions for observation runs must be calculated frequently ( roughly every minute ) to achieve the required precision ( @xmath451  p.e . ) .      during an observation run",
    ", the nsb  modifies the adc  distributions of pedestals . as the coupling between pmt  and ars  behaves like a rc circuit , the short photoelectron pulses ( of positive polarity due to the inverting amplifiers )",
    "are followed by a slight negative undershoot over a few micro - seconds . for typical nsb  rates , of order 100  mhz ( in units of p.e . per second ) , the time between nsb  photoelectrons is short compared to the time constant of the undershoot . the undershoots combine and average , causing a negative shift of the base - line , onto which nsb  photoelectron signals are superimposed in a way that the overall average level remains at the dark - pedestal value .",
    "when pedestals are measured during observation runs , the resulting distributions depend on the level of the nsb . for low nsb",
    ", it can happen that no nsb  photoelectron arrives within the 16  ns integration window ( see section  [ electronic ] ) ; in this case the measured pedestals have a similar narrow width to the dark pedestals , but exhibit a negative shift . combining such events with events with one or more nsb  photoelectrons which are fully or partly contained in the integration window , one finds a pedestal distribution with a sharp rise and peak at the location of the shifted dark pedestal , followed by a smeared single - photoelectron peak and a tail towards higher values ( distribution for 50  mhz nsb   in figure  [ fig : nsbped ] ) .    at",
    "higher nsb  levels , well above 100  mhz , there are usually several photoelectrons within the integration window and the pedestal distribution is essentially gaussian , with a width given by the square root of the mean number of nsb  photoelectrons ( up to small corrections for the electronic noise , the width of the single - photoelectron amplitude distribution and the effect of photoelectron signals truncated by the integration window ) .",
    "the two other distributions shown in figure  [ fig : nsbped ] for 110  mhz and 140  mhz nsb  rates represent intermediate cases , where the asymmetric shape of the poisson distribution in the number of photoelectrons in the integration window is still visible .",
    "+    pedestals for observation runs are determined as often as possible in order to account for camera temperature variations . as a shower image contains typically only 20  pixels ,",
    "real triggered events are used to measure pedestals .",
    "pixels containing cherenkov light are rejected . to identify such image pixels , amplitudes ( in p.e . )",
    "are roughly calculated using the previously - calculated pedestal and using the nominal gain of channels ( 80  adc  counts per p.e . for the hg and 6 for the lg ) . for a given pixel , if neighbouring pixels have a signal amplitude above a threshold ( around 1.5 to 3  p.e . ) or if its own amplitude is above a threshold , this pixel is suspected to be contaminated by cherenkov light .",
    "so this pixel s value for this event does not contribute to this pixel pedestal histogram .",
    "this algorithm is applied for all pixels and all events until there are enough entries in pedestal histograms to determine accurately the pedestal positions from the mean of the histogram .",
    "the frequency of pedestal updates depends on the event rate of the observation run ; pedestals are calculated approximately every minute .",
    "knowledge of the actual nsb  rate in each pixel  possibly influenced by a star in the field of view of the pixel  is important to judge if a pixel can be included in the image analysis .",
    "the nsb  rate can be determined in two ways , from the pedestal width as illustrated in the previous section , and from the pmt  currents .",
    "one method to estimate the nsb  brightness is to use the pixel pedestal widths .",
    "this technique is used as standard by the veritas collaboration @xcite . during an observation ,",
    "the pedestal width is dominated by nsb  photon fluctuations .",
    "the typical pedestal rms  is about 100  adc  counts for the hg channel , corresponding to roughly 1.2 p.e .",
    "the nsb  rate is estimated from the square of the pedestal width ( subtracting the electronic noise and the charge dispersion of a single photoelectron in quadrature ) : @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the pedestal rms  in p.e . , @xmath48 is the electronic pedestal rms  in p.e .",
    ", @xmath49 is the charge dispersion in p.e . of a single photoelectron and @xmath50 is the readout window in seconds .",
    "this expression should be accurate within 10 - 20% considering the corrections mentioned earlier .",
    "because of its small temperature dependence and its larger range , the total current drawn by each pmt  from the hv supply ( hvi ) is used to estimate the nsb , rather than the anode current ( dci ) .",
    "the hvi current is composed of the current drawn in the absence of illumination ( mainly the divider current , proportional to the high voltage ) and a component which increases linearly with the anode current .",
    "the shift of the hvi current from its dark value against dc p.e .",
    "flux ( @xmath51 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : nsb ] .",
    "the relationship is described by equation  [ eqn : hvinsb ] .",
    "@xmath52    to estimate the nsb  with this method , one needs to know the values of the hvi in the dark .",
    "values of the hvi base - lines , @xmath53 , are extracted regularly from runs taken with the camera lids closed .",
    "the adc  used to measure hvi has a very small temperature dependence ( with slopes in the range -0.02 to + 0.03  @xmath54@xmath3c ) compared to the current produced by normal values of nsb , @xmath55  mhz , which is of the order of 3.2@xmath56 .",
    "this temperature dependence can be neglected in the estimation of nsb . +    the correlation between the two estimates of the nsb  is given in figure  [ fig : nsbped ] for one camera for a single observation run , and are in reasonable agreement .",
    "a nsb  rate of 250  mhz corresponds approximately to the presence of a star of magnitude @xmath57 .",
    "pixels with noise levels above this can be treated differently in the cherenkov image analysis and are flagged as noisy .",
    "the pmt  signal , @xmath58 ( see figure  [ fig : acquisitionchannels ] ) , is measured across a resistor and is amplified into two acquisition channels , one with low gain @xmath59 and the other with high gain @xmath60 .",
    "the amplified signals are then converted into a digital signal with @xmath61  ns samples and summed over 16  ns .",
    "the conversion factor of the adc  is approximately @xmath62=1.22mv / count .",
    "the number of ( summed ) adc  counts equivalent to one photoelectron is ( for both readout channels @xmath63 ) : @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the single photoelectron pulse shape .",
    "we define the pixel _ gain _ as this conversion factor .",
    "this factor includes the pmt  gain , the signal amplification in both readout channels and the integration in the ars .",
    "special runs are taken roughly every two days to determine the pixel gains . in these",
    "runs a led pulser is used to illuminate the camera with an intensity of about 1 photoelectron / pixel .",
    "the led and a diffuser are installed two meters in front of the cameras in their shelter .",
    "the light intensity homogeneity over the camera is @xmath66  % .",
    "the calibration led is pulsed at 70  hz and the same signal which pulses this led is used to trigger the camera acquisition ( after a suitable fixed delay ) such that the signal arrives centered in the readout window ( as explained in section  [ timing ] ) .",
    "the pixel gain can be extracted from data taken under @xmath67 photoelectron illumination via a fit to the adc  count distribution of each pixel .",
    "the adc  distribution fit function is derived from the following assumptions : the number of photoelectrons follows a poisson distribution , the electronic noise is much smaller than the width of the single  p.e .",
    "distribution , and the 1  p.e .",
    "distribution is described by a gaussian distribution .",
    "then , the electronic pedestal is approximated by a gaussian with a standard deviation @xmath68 and with a mean position in adc  counts @xmath69 .",
    "the light distribution for a given signal of @xmath70  p.e .",
    "( @xmath71 ) is approximated also by a gaussian with a standard deviation @xmath72 and with a mean position in adc  counts @xmath73 , @xmath24 being the conversion factor between adc  counts and photoelectrons and @xmath49 is the rms  of the charge induced by a single photoelectron . under a mean light intensity @xmath74 the expected signal distribution",

    "all parameters are free except the overall normalisation @xmath76 which is fixed according to the number of events in the run .",
    "the normalisation @xmath77 should be equal to one for a poissonian statistics and can also be adjusted . a sample signal distribution and fit",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig : adctope ] .",
    "the high - gain values of @xmath24 for the four telescopes are given in table  [ tab : calib_cam ] . in january 2004",
    "the mean gains are close to the nominal value of 80  adc  counts per p.e .",
    "and their rms  is around 2 - 3  adc  counts for all telescopes .",
    "the distributions of @xmath24 over pixels are almost gaussian and the pixel gains are randomly distributed within the cameras .",
    ".summary of mean values of calibration coefficients in january 2004 , and of their variation across pixels in a camera .",

    "the newly calculated coefficients should be close to 1.0 and provide an estimate of the coefficient uncertainty .    for an example run taken in january",
    "the recalculated flat - field coefficients distributions are gaussian and their rms  are @xmath78 , respectively , for ct1 , ct2 , ct3 and ct4 , implying an accuracy of @xmath79% . + a completely independent estimate of flat - field coefficients can be made using muon ring images .",
    "as the cherenkov emission of single muons is very well understood , it is possible to accurately predict the charge distribution and shape of the muon rings observed . for each muon ring , the particular geometrical parameters ( impact distance , arrival angle ,  ) are fit to the image .",
    "the ratio of the actual and expected charges gives an estimate of the efficiency of every pixel on the ring .",
    "this method is described in detail in @xcite and produces @xmath26 coefficients that agree with the standard calculation at the few percent level .",
    "this level of agreement is encouraging given the completely different systematic errors associated with this independent method .",
    "comparisons of unusable channels have also been made between the two calibration techniques . except for one or two channels per camera ,",
    "the identified unlocked arss  are identical . concerning the other types of problems , the agreement is generally good , in spite of different methods for unusable channel identification .",

    "the flat - field coefficients have been evaluated by a different method using muon rings @xcite and they are in agreement with the standard coefficients . in conclusion , the calibration of cameras appears to be robust and accurate .",
    "pixel amplitudes in units of effective ( flat - fielded ) photoelectrons should be accurate , for the usual amplitudes , within a pedestal error of less than 0.1  p.e . and a linear error of less than 5% , including systematic uncertainties introduced by the required assumptions about the exact shape of the amplitude distributions of single photoelectrons , relevant for the gain calibration .",
    "the statistical uncertainties are negligible compared to the systematic ones because of the high number of calibration runs and the high number of events .",

    "the absolute calibration can either be based on laboratory measurements of these quantities or on the use of muon rings ; the latter approach will be presented in a separate paper . moreover",
