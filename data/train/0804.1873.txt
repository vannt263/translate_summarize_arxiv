    "the binding energy of new nuclides both in the superheavy element region and the regions close to the proton and neutron drip lines are still poorly known and the different theoretical extrapolations do not fully agree . therefore other studies are still necessary to better predict the masses of such exotic nuclei .",
    "the atomic nucleus resembling to a charged liquid drop , semi - macroscopic models including a pairing energy term have been firstly advanced to determine the nuclear masses @xcite .",
    "macroscopic - microscopic approaches , mainly the finite - range droplet model and the finite - range liquid drop model @xcite have been proposed to simulate the smooth part of the nuclear masses and the non smooth part depending on the parity of the proton and neutron numbers and the proximity of the magic numbers .",
    "nuclear masses have also been reproduced accurately within the statistical thomas - fermi model within a seyler - blanchard effective interaction @xcite .",
    "microscopic hartree - fock self - consistent calculations using the mean - field approach and gogny or skyrme forces and pairing correlations @xcite as well as relativistic mean field theories @xcite have also been advanced to try to reproduce these nuclear masses .",
    "neural networks have been recently used @xcite in the same purpose .    beyond the description of the nuclear ground state energy , the evolution of the nuclear binding energy with deformation and rotation governs the fission , fusion , cluster and @xmath6 decay potential barriers and the existence of the well deformed rotating states .",
    "within the liquid drop model approach , the main characteristics of these barriers may be reproduced using , firstly , four basic macroscopic terms : the volume , surface , coulomb and nuclear proximity energy terms and , secondly , shell and pairing energy contributions to explain structure effects and improve quantitatively the results @xcite .    in a first paper @xcite some coefficients and terms of the liquid drop model mass formula and a specific nuclear radius",
    "have been fitted using a set of 1522 experimental nuclear masses .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to extend this investigation to determine the relative efficiency of different more complex combinations of terms of the liquid drop model to reproduce the masses @xcite of 2027 nuclei and to study , particularly , the separated influence of the curvature energy , the different forms of the wigner term and of different powers of the relative neutron excess @xmath0 . as suggested in @xcite fits on ground state masses alone",
    "have been prefered as was done with the hartree - fock mass formulae to avoid that the parameters might be distorted by the theoretical and experimental uncertainties associated with the barriers .",
    "the second aim is to fit the experimental nuclear charge radii by different expressions and to compare with the relative charge radii @xmath7 derived from the different mass formulae .",
    "finally , the coefficients of the mass formulae using these different expressions for the charge radius are determined as well as their accuracy .",
    "another motivation of this work is to improve later the coefficients of the generalized liquid drop model previously proposed @xcite .",
    "recently , the mutual influence of terms in semi - empirical formulae has been deeply investigated @xcite .",
    "the nuclear binding energy @xmath8(a , z ) is the energy needed for separating all the nucleons constituting a nucleus .",
    "it is related to the nuclear mass @xmath9 by @xmath10 b@xmath11(a , z ) may thus be connected to the experimental atomic masses given in @xcite since : @xmath12 the binding energy b@xmath13(z ) of all removed electrons is @xcite @xmath14 with @xmath15  mev and @xmath16  mev .",
    "different subsets of the following expansion of the nuclear binding energy in powers of @xmath17 and @xmath18 have been considered : @xmath19 the first term gives the volume energy corresponding to the saturated exchange force and infinite nuclear matter .",
    "@xmath20 is the asymmetry energy of the bethe - weizscker mass formula .",
    "the second term is the surface energy .",
    "it takes into account the deficit of binding energy of the nucleons at the nuclear surface and corresponds to semi - infinite nuclear matter .",
    "the bethe - weizscker mass formula does not consider the dependence of the surface energy on @xmath21 .",
    "this term was originally contained in the weizscker formula @xcite .",
    "the third term is the curvature energy .",
    "it is a correction to the surface energy resulting from local properties and consequently depending on the mean local curvature .",
    "this term is considered in the lublin - strasbourg drop ( lsd ) model @xcite , the tf model @xcite but not in the frldm @xcite . in the three first terms a dependence on @xmath18 and @xmath4 , the so - called malacodermous term , has been envisaged since they have been proposed to better reproduce the fission barrier heights @xcite and to simulate the softening of the surface of highly neutron - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "the a@xmath22 term appears when the surface term is extended to include higher order terms in a@xmath23 and @xmath21 .",
    "the fifth term gives the decrease of binding energy due to the repulsion between the protons . in the bethe - weizscker mass formula",
    "this coulomb energy is proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "different formulae will be assumed for the charge radius .",
    "the @xmath1 term is the diffuseness correction to the basic sharp radius coulomb energy term ( called also the proton form - factor correction to the coulomb energy in @xcite ) and the term proportional to @xmath2 is the charge exchange correction term .",
    "the pairing energy has been calculated with the following expressions used for spherical nuclei in the recent version of the thomas - fermi model @xcite .",
    "+ for odd z , odd n and n = z nuclei @xmath25 for odd z , odd n and @xmath26 nuclei @xmath27 for odd z , even n nuclei @xmath28 for even z , odd n nuclei @xmath29 for even z , even n nuclei @xmath30    the theoretical shell effects used in the tf model ( @xmath31 column of the table in @xcite and @xcite ) have also been retained since they allow to reproduce correctly the masses from fermium to @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "they have been calculated from the strutinsky shell - correction method and previously to the other coefficients of the tf model .",
    "the fits on nuclear masses depend necessarily on the choice of the selected theoretical shell effects or the formulae chosen to describe these shell effects .",
    "the sign for the shell energy term comes from the adopted definition in @xcite .",
    "it gives , for example , a contribution of @xmath33mev to the binding energy of @xmath34pb .",
    "the wigner energy allows to reproduce the kink in the nuclear mass surface that is not a shell effect in the usual sense .",
    "it depends on @xmath21 and appears in the counting of identical pairs in a nucleus .",
    "different expressions are considered .",
    "the first expression is simply @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "its effect is to decrease the binding energy when @xmath26 .",
    "the congruence energy term is given by : @xmath36 it represents an extra binding energy associated with the presence of congruent pairs @xcite .",
    "within an hartree - fock approach @xcite it has been assumed that there is nothing compelling about an exponential representation and a gaussian expression @xmath37 is just as acceptable .",
    "another term has also been proposed in @xcite @xmath38 we have also tested separately two other possible expressions @xmath39 and @xmath40 the term of nuclear proximity energy does not appear in the binding energy of the ground state since it becomes effective only for necked shapes but not for slightly deformed ground states .",
    "to obtain the coefficients of the different expansions by a least square fitting procedure , the masses of the 2027 nuclei verifying the two conditions : n and z higher than 7 and the one standard deviation uncertainty on the mass lower than or equal to 150 kev @xcite have been used .",
    "these restrictions are not employed by all investigators @xcite .",
    "the root - mean - square deviation @xmath41 defined by @xmath42 has been used to determine the relative efficiency of the different selected sets of terms since @xmath43 where f is the number of fit parameters .",
    "a very efficient software has been used .",
    "the extraction of standard errors on the fit parameters seems very difficult but the errors are surely very weak . on the other hand , the values of the last decimals of a coefficient",
    "can be changed in counterbalancing by a change in the last decimals of another coefficient for almost the same rms deviation .    in table",
    "i , the improvement of the nuclear mass reproduction when additional contributions are added to the basic @xmath44 terms is clearly displayed .",
    "the curvature energy is not taken into account .",
    "the introduction of the pairing term is obviously necessary .",
    "the introduction of a constant term improves slightly the adjustment and changes strongly the surface energy coefficient .",
    "it induces also a severe discontinuity during the transition from one to two - body shapes as in fission , fusion or @xmath6 emission .",
    "the congruence energy term at least with the fixed coefficients adopted here ( as in the lsd and tf models ) is much less efficient to lower @xmath41 than the wigner term w@xmath18 . when the coefficients before the exponential and the exponent are free the congruence energy tends to the usual wigner term since the coefficient before the exponential diminishes while the exponent increases .",
    "the diffuseness correction to the coulomb energy and the standard wigner term w@xmath18 can be used separately to strongly lower @xmath41 .",
    "the wigner energy is approximately independent of the nuclear shape @xcite . in a division into 2 fragments , all with the same value of @xmath18 , the form w@xmath18 for the wigner energy jumps at scission to 2 times its original value , which leads to a discontinuity of around 6.7 mev of the potential energy at the scission point between the nascent fragments for @xmath45fm as an example . for the congruence energy",
    "the discontinuity is also important : 3.9 mev for this same nucleus .",
    "the coulomb diffuseness correction term has the main advantage to be almost continuous at the scission point in the entrance or exit channels .",
    "the combination of the coulomb diffuseness correction term and the w@xmath18 term allows to reach the very satisfactory value @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath47 term is useful to improve the accuracy of the expansion and is more effective than the @xmath48 term but when the wigner term and the coulomb diffuseness correction factor term are taken into account the introduction of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 terms are ineffective .    in table",
    "ii , the efficiency of the curvature energy term with different @xmath21 dependences is investigated without taking into account the wigner contribution .",
    "when the coulomb diffuseness correction is disregarded the introduction of the term in @xmath51 allows to decrease @xmath41 of 0.1 mev .",
    "when the coulomb diffuseness correction is considered the term in @xmath51 is ineffective .",
    "the addition of a @xmath52 term improves slightly the results .",
    "supplementary terms in @xmath3 to calculate the volume , surface and curvature energies allow finally to reach @xmath41=0.58  mev .",
    "they are still more efficient than the @xmath4 terms .",
    "the curvature energy has the advantage to be continuous at the scission point at least in symmetric entrance or decay channels .",
    "it has the disadvantage that its value ( and its sign ) lacks of stability .",
    "these two first tables show a good convergency of the volume a@xmath53 and asymmetry volume k@xmath53 constants respectively towards around 15.5  mev and @xmath54 .",
    "the variation of the surface coefficient is larger but a@xmath55 evolves around 17 - 18  mev .",
    "small values of the surface coefficient favors quasi - molecular or two - body shapes at the saddle - point of the potential barriers while large values of @xmath56 promote one - body elongated shapes .",
    "as it is well known the surface asymmetry coefficient k@xmath55 is less easy to precise .    for the bethe - weizscker formula",
    "the fitting procedure leads to @xmath57 with @xmath41=1.30  mev .",
    "that gives r@xmath5=1.216  fm and k@xmath53=1.506 .",
    "the @xmath41 value is explained by the non dependence of the surface energy term on the relative neutron excess @xmath21 .",
    "the mass formulae including a wigner term given by the formulae ( 12),(13 ) or ( 14 ) are examined in table  iii .",
    "the values of @xmath58 which minimize the mass rms deviation are respectively 48 , 35 and 40 for these three expressions .",
    "they are determined with an accuracy of around 5 mass numbers .",
    "these formulas for the wigner energy are supposed to be approximately independent of the nuclear shape .",
    "their discontinuity at the scission point of fission or fusion barriers is less important than that of the congruence and w@xmath18 terms .",
    "for example , for the expressions @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 and symmetric decay of the @xmath62fm the discontinuities at the contact point of the nascent fragments are respectively 0 , 0.05 and 2.2 mev .",
    "the first , fifth and eighth lines of the table indicate that within the simplest form for the volume and surface energies , thus with only 7 parameters , the r.m.s deviation on the masses is less than 0.6 mev .",
    "the introduction of a dependence on @xmath18 and of the curvature energy lowers @xmath41 of 0.04  mev within the expression ( 12 ) and of 0.02  mev for the two last ones .",
    "the surface energy coefficients are generally lower with these forms of the wigner energy and , consequently , @xmath63 is generally higher .    within the wigner term derived from the hartree - fock approach @xcite and taking @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the formulas ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) as derived using the bsk2 skyrme force the following formula",
    "is obtained @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "the accuracy can be improved in varying @xmath58 and @xmath68 : @xmath69 it leads to @xmath70 and produces sizable changes in several of the other parameters which proves the importance of the wigner term and the mutual influence of terms in the semi - empirical mass formulae @xcite .    in table",
    "iv the efficiency of the charge exchange correction term in @xmath2 is studied .",
    "the lines can be compared respectively to the @xmath31 line of table 1 , @xmath71 line of table 2 , @xmath72 line of table 1 , @xmath73 line of table 2 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 lines of table 1 and @xmath76 and @xmath77 lines of table 3 .",
    "the only change is that the diffuseness correction term in @xmath1 has been replaced by the charge exchange correction term .",
    "it is quite interesting to observe that the introduction of these two terms separately leads to the same accuracy , the same value of the charge radius , almost the same values of the surface coefficients and to small changes of the volume coefficients .",
    "so the charge exchange correction term is as efficient as the diffuseness correction term and there is no correlation between these two terms and the charge radius and the surface coefficients and weak correlation with the volume coefficients .",
    "the introduction of both these two terms does not allow to improve the accuracy of the mass formulae and leads to spurious values of the volume coefficient .",
    "finally , the shell and pairing energies , the diffuseness correction term to the coulomb energy , the charge exchange correction term and the wigner energy separately lead to significant reductions of the rms deviation while the other terms increase the accuracy by only 2 or 3 per cent . a correlation between the surface coefficient and the radius",
    "can be extracted .",
    "the relative radius @xmath63 diminishes when the surface coefficient increases .",
    "experimentally and for nuclei verifying n and z higher than 7 the set of 782 ground state nuclear charge radii presented in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates a rms charge radii of @xmath78 which leads for the equivalent rms charge radius ( denoted by q in ref .",
    "@xcite ) given by @xmath79 to the value @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "other data have been obtained recently @xcite . in the adjustment to the nuclear masses displayed in the tables i and",
    "ii the reduced charge radius r@xmath82 converges to 1.22 - 1.23  fm in good agreement with the experimental data for the charge radius .",
    "the introduction of the expressions ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) for the wigner term leads to slightly higher values .",
    "the experimental data indicate that the ratio @xmath83 is not strictly constant .",
    "for example , @xmath84 for @xmath85ca and @xmath86 for @xmath87ca while @xmath88 for @xmath89pb and @xmath90 for @xmath91pb .",
    "these @xmath92 and @xmath63 values correspond to the coulomb energy of a charged liquid drop with constant charge density and spherical sharp surface .",
    "it must not be confused with half - density radius derived from two - parameter fermi function or other parameters entering in other parametrisations of the charge distribution .    in the adjustment to the experimental nuclear masses",
    "the nuclear mass radius is not fitted .",
    "root - mean - squared matter radii are given in ref .",
    "@xcite for specific nuclei . for all isotopic series a decrease of the mass rms radius",
    "is observed with increasing neutron number as for the charge radius . in this mass range ( @xmath93 )",
    "the radius of the neutron and proton distributions are very similar .",
    "global fits lead to an overall contraction of the nuclear radius as @xmath94 increases @xcite , a so called `` isospin shrinkage '' .",
    "recently , an estimate of the neutron skin linear in the relative neutron excess i has been extracted from experimental proton radii and observed mirror displacement energies @xcite and the coefficients have been also determined from antiprotonic x - rays and radiochemical data @xcite .    within a simple form of the mass formula including the coulomb diffuseness correction and the wigner term given by the formula ( 13 ) but not the dependence on the curvature energy and on @xmath18 and @xmath4 the introduction of the factor @xmath95 deduced from the experimental charge radius leads to @xmath96 and @xmath97",
    "more accurate formulae may be used to reproduce the mean behaviour of the equivalent rms charge radius .",
    "the expression @xmath98 leads to @xmath99 .",
    "its introduction in the above - mentioned mass formula curiously diminishes the accuracy to @xmath100 .",
    "the same behaviour is observed when the dependence in @xmath1 is replaced by a dependence in @xmath2 .",
    "the formula @xmath101 leads to @xmath102 , while for the corresponding mass formula @xmath103 .",
    "the adjustment to the experimental charge radii within the form proposed in ref.@xcite gives @xmath104 with @xmath102 and @xmath105 while the form selected in ref.@xcite leads to @xmath106 and @xmath102 for the radius and @xmath107 for the corresponding mass formula .",
    "the form of the expression given the equivalent rms charge radius proposed in ref.@xcite @xmath108 gives a good accuracy @xmath109 but @xmath110 .",
    "the fact that improved formulae for the charge radius lead to significantly poorer fits to the masses calls into question the reliability of the equivalent uniform charge distribution as a link between charge radii and coulomb energy .",
    "finally a rms deviation for the charge radius of only 0.01 fm ( fitted on 362 nuclei ) has been obtained in ref .",

    "this formula coming from the droplet model approach simulated a small decrease of the density with increasing mass .",
    "this does not seem corroborated by the experimental data @xcite at least on the charge radius .",
    "nevertheless without changing the surface and coulomb energies which are shape - dependent terms , the adjustment of the volume energy coefficients and the introduction of a pure wigner term leads to @xmath113 and @xmath114 . the introduction of other terms can still allow to diminish @xmath41 .",
