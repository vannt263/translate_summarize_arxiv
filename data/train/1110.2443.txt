    "in a recent paper@xcite , the concept of disorder has been introduced in random matrix theory ( rmt ) to denote ensembles of random matrices generated by superimposing an external source of randomness to the fluctuations of the gaussian ensembles .",

    "the ergodicity property of the standard ensembles , characterized by the equivalence between spectral averages taken along the spectrum and averages extracted from the spectra of a set of matrices is broken .",
    "this creates an ambiguity in measuring its collective spectral fluctuations although for those which concern individual eigenvalues such as extreme value statistics it remains well defined . this kind of statistics has been object of many studies@xcite in the last decades . in this direction , it was shown how the behavior of the largest eigenvalue described by the tracy - widom distribution@xcite is affected by disorder@xcite .",
    "despite the great success the rmt gaussian ensemble had and has ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) , it has features of an abstract mathematical model such as , for example , an eigenvalue density defined in a compact support .",
    "parallel to its development , there was a search for models whose randomness would be closer to physical situations .",

    ", the hamiltonian model is made randomic by taking the strength of the residual interaction among particles from a gaussian distribution .",
    "these ensembles show as main features : correlations among matrix elements , gaussian eigenvalue density and non - ergodicity@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , their spectral fluctuations are supposed to follow , under restricted conditions that take into account the non - ergodicity ambiguity , the same fluctuations pattern of the gaussian matrices , namely the wigner - dyson statistics@xcite .",
    "disordered ensembles may provide a simple way to understand features of these physical motivated ensembles .",
    "families of disordered ensembles have , so far , been considered mostly in association with an external randomness governed by the gamma distribution@xcite .",
    "this leads to ensembles in which statistics are dominated by power law behavior that implies strong non - ergodicity .",
    "it has also been considered the case of the inverse gamma distribution@xcite which contains singularities .",

    "<S> the spectral density evolves from the semi - circle law to a gaussian - like behavior while concomitantly the local fluctuations show a transition from the wigner - dyson to the poisson statistics . </S>",
