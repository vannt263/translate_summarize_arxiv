    "the first results for boron abundances in stars of the orion association were provided by a study of the bii 1362   line in four b - type stars ( cunha et al .",
    "the non - lte abundances derived for these orion stars were between log @xmath1(b ) = 2.5 - 2.9 , i.e. close to the boron abundance measured in solar system meteorites ( log @xmath1(b ) = 2.78 ) or the solar photosphere ( log @xmath1(b ) = 2.7 , where log @xmath1(x)=log n(x)/n(h ) + 12 ) .",
    "a second study of boron in the orion association using the g - dwarf bd-5@xmath01317 found a boron abundance lower by about 0.7 dex than the solar / meteoritic value ( cunha , smith & lambert 1999 ) .",
    "this particular orion member was picked because i ) it had an undepleted lithium abundance and ii ) it exhibited one of the largest oxygen abundances measured in the association ( log @xmath1(o)=9.11 ; cunha , smith & lambert 1998 ) .",
    "the absence of li depletion guarantees that the boron was not destroyed in the stellar interior . as a consequence",
    ", the observed boron abundance is expected to reflect the original abundance at the time of star formation .",
    "as for the high oxygen abundance , it is attributed to the self - enrichment of the orion cloud ( cunha & lambert 1994 ) , caused by the explosion of massive stars as type ii supernovae ( sn ii ) . according to this model , the o - rich sn ii ejecta ` pollute ' certain pockets of gas around the site of the explosion , from which new stars form with enhanced oxygen abundances .",
    "this idea is corroborated by the fact that the most o - rich stars in the orion association are also the youngest members and generally co - located ( cunha et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in the present study ,",
    "two additional stars are examined .",
    "they consist of g - dwarfs whose radial velocities and proper motions indicate that they are definite members of the orion association ( cunha , smith & lambert 1995 ) .",
    "these two stars also show different degrees of oxygen enrichment and fulfill the requirement that they do not show significant li depletion . they can thus be used to study the self - enrichment process within the orion clouds .",
    "this is an important goal from the theoretical point of view , since sn ii s are known to be the source not only of o , but also indirectly of libeb .",
    "according to current knowledge ( e.g. vangioni - flam et al . 2000 ) , beryllium and boron can be synthesized only by spallative processes in which heavier nuclei ( mainly c , n and o ) are spallated in reactions induced by energetic particles ( eps ) .",
    "two distinct mechanisms have been invoked , depending on whether the eps are nuclei or neutrinos . in the first case ,",
    "b ( and li and be ) is produced by the spallation of c , n , and o by protons and @xmath2 s .",
    "the other mechanism , known as the @xmath3-process ( or neutrino - spallation ) , consists in breaking nuclei with energetic neutrinos released in enormous numbers during the explosion of type ii supernovae .",
    "the carbon nuclei spalled in this process to make @xmath4b are those synthesized by the massive sn ii progenitor . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath3-process boron is ` ready - mixed ' with the cno in the sn ii ejecta and all these nuclei are released together into the ambient medium .",
    "the @xmath3-process has been invoked to cope with a classical problem resulting from the confrontation of the observed ( solar system ) values of the b / be and @xmath4b/@xmath5b ratios with those predicted by the nucleo - spallation process alone that produces too little @xmath6li and @xmath4b .",
    "the @xmath3-process is predicted to produce @xmath7li and @xmath4b but virtually no @xmath8li , no @xmath9be and no @xmath5b .",
    "therefore , it offers a way to resolve the classical problem .    from the detailed analyses of",
    "be and b abundances in metal - poor halo stars , it has been recently proposed that the eps responsible for most of the light element production are probably accelerated inside superbubbles created by repeated sn ii s in ob associations ( parizot & drury , 1999 , 2000 ; parizot , 2000 ; ramaty et al . 2000 ) . since it is known that the orion association blew just such a superbubble ( sb ) from the winds and explosions of massive stars in subgroup ia ( e.g. brown et al .",
    "1995 ) , it may be expected that significant li , be and b production occurred recently in or close to the orion molecular cloud . the self - enrichment in o of the orion stellar association",
    "should therefore be accompanied by a significant enrichment in light elements as well , and the relation between the two processes is worth studying .    in the last decade ,",
    "b abundances have been measured in disk and halo stars ( duncan , lambert & lemke 1992 ; duncan et al . 1997 ; garca - lpez et al .",
    "1998 ; primas et al . 1999 and cunha et al .",
    "2000 ) showing a global positive correlation of boron with oxygen which is understood as the progressive enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in both metals and light elements .",
    "however , the situation in local environments has never been studied , and one may ask whether the same kind of correlation also holds on smaller scales , within individual stellar associations . our study intends to answer the question in the case of orion .",
    "the two orion targets , bd-6@xmath01250 and hd  294297 , were observed with the stis spectrograph on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , over 10 and 11 orbits each , which were needed in order to obtain combined spectra with a s / n @xmath1050 for the analysis of b i at 2496.771  .",
    "( the measured s / n across the spectral region synthesized ranged from 40 - 60 in both stars ) .",
    "the observations were obtained with the mama detector in the accum mode with the first order grating g230 m , plus 52x0.1 slit to record the spectral region between 2454 and 2545   with a resolution r@xmath1014,000 .",
    "the observed stis spectra were processed by the pipeline calibration from stsci with the iraf package ` calstis ' which was used in order to subtract the bias , divide by the flatfield and wavelength calibrate the data .",
    "these pipeline calibrated spectra were then combined with the iraf task mscombine and extracted one - dimensional spectra were obtained with the task apsum. unlike the spectra obtained with the echelle grating , the levels of scattered light in the first - order grating spectra are insignificant and the step of subtraction of scattered light was not needed .",
    "the final spectra of the two orion targets are shown in the two panels of figure 1 .",
    "the stellar parameters adopted in the calculation of the model atmospheres for the two studied stars ( plus a sample of orion members ) are presented in table 1 . the effective temperatures from cunha et al .",
    "( 1995 ) were obtained from a calibration of the strmgren @xmath11 indices with spectroscopic effective temperatures defined by the fe i lines present in the optical spectra of slowly rotating stars in the direction of orion .",
    "the surface gravities for the rapid rotators were assumed in cunha et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to be 4.0 .",
    "here we have adjusted the log g for hd  294297 to a higher value ( log g=4.4 ) because this produced an overall better fit in the spectral region between 2494.5 and 2499.5  .",
    "the sensitivity of the derived boron abundance to changes in log g will be discussed in section 4.2 .",
    "boron abundances were derived from spectrum synthesis of the region around the bi resonance line at 2496.771  , which is the less blended boron resonance line available . in an effort to place all derived boron abundances for near - solar metallicity stars on the same absolute scale ,",
    "the present analysis of the two orion targets is entirely consistent with the previous analysis of a sample of near - solar metallicity solar type dwarfs ( with [ fe / h ] ranging from -0.75 to + 0.15 ) from hst archival data ( cunha et al .",
    "the analysis of the b i spectral region in near solar - temperature and solar - metallicity stars is complicated by the definition of the continuum level ; the spectra are crowded with strong absorption lines and no regions are free from absorption .",
    "as discussed in previous studies of b i ( cunha & smith 1999 ; cunha et al . 1999 ; 2000 ) , the continuum level in this region was set for the sun , where observed specific intensities are available , using the combination of synthesis code , line list , and solar model atmosphere .",
    "the relative position of the continuum to spectral line depths does not vary much over the limited range of t@xmath12 spanned by the orion g stars .",
    "the continuum level is allowed to vary slightly in order to provide the best fit to the absorption lines .",
    "this analysis technique was applied to 14 field f and g dwarfs ( cunha et al .",
    "2000 ) , for which reasonably accurate distances were available , and a consistency check was carried out between predicted and observed continuum fluxes .",
    "a model surface flux at 2500  , f@xmath13 , comes from the model atmosphere , and the predicted continuum flux observed at the earth , f@xmath13 , is f@xmath13=f@xmath13(r / d)@xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the stellar radius and @xmath16 is the distance ; to compute the stellar radius requires distance , apparent magnitude , reddening , a bolometric correction , and t@xmath12 .",
    "we call this the calculated continuum flux , f(calc ) .",
    "this flux can be compared to the empirical continuum flux at 2500   set by the spectrum synthesis , which we call the observed continuum flux , f(obs ) .    the comparison of f(calc)/f(obs ) for the field f and g dwarfs from cunha et al .",
    "( 2000 ) was quite good ( their figure 3 ) : with an average f(calc)/f(obs ) being 0.91@xmath170.19 and having no trend in this ratio with t@xmath12 over the range 5600 - 6700 k. this same technique can be applied to the orion stars as the distance to the orion association is reasonably well - known , e.g. warren & hesser ( 1978 ) ; de zeeuw et al .",
    "the orion association subgroups ib and ic extend over a distance of @xmath1040 pc ( de zeuw et al .",
    "1999 ) and we adopt a single distance of 490 pc for the 3 g - dwarfs observed to date by hst .",
    "a reddening of e(b - v)=0.05 is assumed for all orion stars and the ( small ) bolometric corrections are from bhm - vitense ( 1989 ) .",
    "results for f(cal)/f(obs ) in the orion members are shown versus t@xmath12 in the top panel of figure 2 , along with the previously derived results for the field f and g dwarfs from cunha et al .",
    "the orion members agree well with the field stars and indicate that the analysis technique used to define the continuum is consistent .",
    "the mean value of f(calc)/f(obs ) for the orion members is 0.89@xmath170.18 , very similar to the field stars .",
    "the comparison between the field - star sample and the orion stars indicates that there are not significant model - induced systematic differences between the two sets of analyses .",
    "a quantitative estimate of the uncertainties associated with empirically fitting the continuum levels can be made by investigating line depths as functions of t@xmath12 and [ fe / h ] for the orion targets , as well as the larger sample of field dwarfs studied in cunha et al .",
    "line depths measured relative to a continuum level should depend primarily on the effective temperature and metallicity .",
    "the flux at a local high point in the spectra of these stars , near 2500   ( whose level is controlled by line blanketing ) , was then compared to the continuum flux derived empirically from the spectrum synthesis ( f(obs ) ) at this wavelength .",
    "it is found that this ratio of the observed line depth to the empirically derived continuum is a well - defined , smooth curve as a function of t@xmath12 , for near solar - metallicity stars ( with [ fe / h]@xmath18 - 0.2 ) .",
    "this is shown in the bottom panel of figure 2 where we plot this ratio versus the effective temperature for the field and orion dwarfs .",
    "inspection of the figure shows that this ratio varies from @xmath100.25 at t@xmath12=5600k , to @xmath100.65 at t@xmath196700k .",
    "note that the line - depth to continuum values increase for the metal - poor stars , as expected due to reduced metal line blanketing .",
    "the observed scatter of the ratios about the mean curve defined for the near - solar metallicity stars is @xmath170.04 .",
    "the flux ratio of the local high point ( at 2500  ) to the continuum varies from 0.3 to 0.4 for the three studied orion stars and these three stars follow the relation of flux ratio versus t@xmath12 defined by the near - solar metallicity field stars .",
    "if the continuum flux level for the orion g - dwarfs is thus allowed to vary by @xmath170.04 , the resulting derived b abundance varies by @xmath170.11 dex : this is a fair measurement of the abundance uncertainty introduced from the uncertainties in the continuum level .",
    "our synthetic spectra were computed using the program linfor ( originally developed at kiel university by h. holweger , m. steffen & w. steenbock ) and model atmospheres generated with the atlas9 code ( r. l. kurucz , 1993 - private communication ) for the stellar parameters in table 1 .",
    "the calculations of the synthetic spectra included a more modern value for the bound - free cross - section of mgi 3p@xmath20 , which is the dominant source of continuous opacity in the 2500   region .",
    "the importance of this choice is pointed out in cunha & smith ( 1999 ) . in the calculation of the synthetic spectra the adopted mg abundance was scaled with the oxygen abundance for each star .",
    "the adopted line list was compiled first in order to fit the disk - center spectrum of the sun , later this line list was fine - tuned in order to fit the spectra of the sample of near - solar metallicity dwarfs ( mentioned above ) with effective temperatures in the range between 5650k and 6700k .",
    "this line list can be found in cunha et al .",

    "we illustrate synthetic spectra for the studied stars . using a simple @xmath21 minimization we derive an lte boron abundance of log @xmath1(b)=2.60@xmath170.20 for hd294297 and log @xmath1(b)=2.30@xmath170.20 for bd-6@xmath01250 with the uncertainties set by the sharpness of the @xmath21 minima .",
    "corrections for non - lte effects in stars of solar temperatures and metallicities are small : kiselman & carlsson s ( 1996 ) non - lte calculations for the bi lines indicate revised non - lte abundances of log @xmath1(b)=2.34 and log @xmath1(b)=2.65 , respectively , for hd294297 and bd-6@xmath01250 . the derived boron abundances for the target stars plus their derived li , fe and o abundances are assembled in table 1 .",
    "we also added to this table other orion members that have been studied in previous papers ( cunha et al .",
    "1995 , 1998 ) and that will be brought into the discussion of the abundance results and uncertainties that follow .",
    "we note the addition of one star ( p1374 ) that has not been published previously .",
    "a summary of boron and oxygen abundances in orion is presented in figure 4 . combined with the non - lte b - star boron abundances ,",
    "the three points defined by the orion solar - type stars indicate clearly that there is no positive trend of boron with oxygen in orion .",
    "in fact , if there is any discernable trend of b and o , it is an anticorrelation .",
    "a possible anticorrelation is made all the more convincing by the combination of two sets of results from very different types of stars : b stars with t@xmath22 @xmath10 18000 - 22000k ( analyzing bii ) and g stars with t@xmath22 @xmath10 5850 - 6150k ( analyzing bi ) .",
    "taken together , the b and g stars seem to define a single relation of decreasing boron with increasing oxygen among the stellar members of orion .",
    "the most oxygen - rich and boron - poor orion star in figure 4 is the g - star bd-5@xmath01317 , whose b i spectrum was analyzed in cunha et al .",
    "much of the weight of a significant anticorrelation between b and o falls on this star .",
    "cunha et al . discussed whether the boron abundance derived from b i could be influenced by some unkonwn effect , most probably a chromosphere , but were unable to find an obvious explanation for the weakened b i line in bd-5@xmath01317 ( including the addition of a chromosphere to the model atmosphere ) , other than a low b abundance .",
    "this star was studied for li , fe , and o in cunha et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1998 ) and no obvious spectral peculiarities were noted ; however , future spectroscopic studies of this star are encouraged .",
    "if a linear least - squares fit is performed on the log @xmath1(b ) versus log @xmath1(o ) data from orion , a slope of -1.1@xmath170.2 is found ( with a correlation coeficient r= -0.94 ) , indicating a significant decrease of b with o.    to probe the robustness of this apparent decrease of b as o increases , tests on the boron and oxygen abundance dataset were conducted . as a first step , the data point for bd-5@xmath01317",
    "was excluded from another linear least - squares fit on the remaining 6 points ; in this case a significant anticorrelation ( r=-0.90 ) is still found between b and o with a slope of -1.3@xmath170.3 ( within the errors , the same slope found with the inclusion of bd-5@xmath01317 ) . reduced values of @xmath21 can also be computed from the expression    @xmath23    where ` observed ' and ` fitted ' refer to the observed values and linear least - squares computed values , respectively , @xmath24 is the associated error , and @xmath3 is the number of degrees of freedom . using @xmath24=0.20 dex ,",

    "if a zero slope between b and o is assumed ( i.e. no trend ) , the associated values of @xmath25 are 15.40 ( with the inclusion of bd-5@xmath01317 ) and 7.82 ( with the exclusion of bd-5@xmath01317 ) : both of these values indicate extremely poor fits to the data ( well past the 3@xmath24 level of confidence ) . because the observed trend is significant and opposite to the global correlation between b and o in the galaxy , over three orders of magnitude in metallicity , an investigation into whether errors can produce such an anticorrelation is carried out .",
    "as this paper deals with an analysis of g - type stars , the discussion of possible errors in boron and oxygen abundances is confined to stars of this spectral type for which the bi 2497   line and the oi 7770   triplet provide the b and o abundances , respectively .",
    "the ground - based and hst spectra analyzed for both oxygen and boron are of relatively high s / n , and errors in the derived abundances are due primarily to uncertainties in the crucial stellar parameters : effective temperature ( t@xmath22 ) , surface gravity ( log g ) , and microturbulent velocity ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "typical oi equivalent widths for the three g stars were used as input in order to compute the effects of the parameter changes on derived o abundances . for boron uncertainties , the discussions from primas et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and boesgaard et al . (",
    "1998 ) were used .",

    "of special note are the anticorrelated o and b abundance errors for changes in temperature and surface gravity ; for example , if the effective temperature of a star were overestimated by 100k , the derived o abundance would be too low by 0.08 dex , while the derived b abundance would be too high by 0.10 dex .",
    "this effect results in spurious anticorrelations between b and o for _ random _ temperature and gravity errors ; however , we note that the observed scale of the anticorrelation over the range of derived b and o abundances would require errors much larger than estimated , for example , @xmath27 t @xmath29 600k .",

    "no obvious trend exists and a linear regression finds no correlation , with an insignificant positive slope of 0.1@xmath170.2 derived .",
    "note that in the previous discussion of the various elemental abundance sensitivities to stellar parameters , the fe i and o i lines have both temperature and gravity sensitivties that are of nearly equal magnitudes but in opposite senses , thus , substantial , random stellar parameter errors would produce anticorrelated fe and o abundances .",

    "as was the case with fe and o , if a single value for the o and b abundances are assumed for all orion members , random stellar parameter errors will produce an apparent anticorrelation of b with o ; however , for realistic values of t@xmath22 , log g , and microturbulence uncertainties , the model abundance scatter is much smaller than that observed .",
    "inputting the o scatter of @xmath100.5 dex , as suggested by the fe - o analysis , two model simulations are shown in the bottom panel of figure 6 : each distribution of slopes is generated from 3 model points ( as in the observed sample ) , each run through 1000 realizations .",
    "one input model had a constant b abundance , and the distribution of slopes is scattered about a mean slope of 0.0 , very far from the observed slope of -1 .",
    "the second input model assumed an anticorrelations of b with o , with log @xmath1(b ) proportional to log @xmath1(o)@xmath28 . in this case , with the given uncertainties in stellar parameters , the slope distribution scatters about -1.0 .",
    "note that with only 3 points , the scatter in slopes is larger than for the 9 points used for the fe and o model .",
    "these simulations suggest that the combination of fe , o , and b abundances in the orion members indicate a constant fe abundance , variable o abundance , and a variable b abundance that is inversely proportional to oxygen .",
    "finally , lithium abundances for orion members , when compared to oxygen abundances , can further constrain the interpretation of boron in orion .",
    "the top panel of figure 7 shows the li and o abundances for 10 orion members .",
    "interpretation of li must take into account the susceptibility of this element to destruction by warm protons .",
    "two separate symbols are used in figure 7 : the filled symbols denote stars with lithium near the expected undepleted abundance of log @xmath1(li)= 3.3 , while the open symbols are stars which have almost certainly depleted lithium somewhat . in cunha",
    "et al . ( 1995 ) , it was found that the lower li abundances in orion members were for the slowest rotators ( vsin@xmath31 @xmath32 10 km s@xmath28 ) and may be stars in which lithium has been destroyed from mixing induced by rotational spindown . if the low li stars are set aside , the very flat values of undepleted li versus o in the top panel of figure 7 suggest lithium is independent of oxygen . because the lii line is very temperature sensitive ( and in the opposite sense to oi lines ) , the lack of a large scatter in the li abundances and the absence of an apparent anticorrelation of li and o , is an additional argument that large errors in the stellar parameters do not exist for the orion sample of solar - type stars .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 7 shows distributions of slopes in simulated data for two different models : constant li with varying o ( resulting in model slope distributions near 0.0 , as observed in the real data ) , and li abundances which decrease as o@xmath33 .",
    "the observed li abundances suggest no significant trend of li with o , and are most easily fit with the estimated errors of 150k in t@xmath22 , 0.3 dex in log g , and 0.2 km s@xmath28 in @xmath26 . with these errors ,",
    "the derived anticorrelation of boron with oxygen is real and must be explained .    of interest to this investigation",
    "is a comparison with the interstellar abundances of boron and oxygen in the association s gas .",
    "both abundances have been measured along sightlines in orion but not to stars for which we have b and o abundances .",
    "meyer , jura , & cardelli ( 1998 ) provided the `` definitive '' interstellar o abundance including measurements for 5 stars in orion . from these and other sightlines ,",
    "the o abundance measured from oi 1356   line was remarkably uniform with no evidence for direct condensation of oxygen atoms onto grains . when an estimate of oxygen atoms tied up in grains is added to the measured abundance",
    ", the total oxygen abundance was put at log @xmath1(o ) = 8.60 with an uncertainty of less than 0.1 dex .    in diffuse",
    "interstellar clouds , gaseous boron is expected to be predominantly present as b@xmath34 ions .",
    "detections of these ions through weak absorption at the 1362   bii line are reported by jura et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , lambert et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and howk , sembach , & savage ( 2000 ) for various sightlines .",
    "abundances , as summarized by lambert et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , for sightlines to orion are log @xmath1(b ) @xmath29 2.0 when independent observations of the h column density ( mostly hi ) are considered .",
    "this is a lower limit to the interstellar b abundance because some boron atoms may have condensed onto interstellar grains .",
    "the combination of measured interstellar abundances in the direction of orion of log @xmath1(b ) @xmath29 2.0 and log @xmath1(o ) = 8.6 ( meyer et al .",
    "1998 ) is shown in figure 4 , where it is seen to lie off the trend shown by the orion stars .",
    "recently , howk , sembach , & savage ( 2000 ) have reported a higher interstellar boron abundance , log @xmath1(b ) @xmath29 2.4 .",
    "they attribute their higher abundance to observations of clouds of lower density in which depletion of boron onto grains is less severe .",
    "however , the newly observed lines of sight are to distant stars , primarily toward the galactic center .",
    "if the diffuse clouds are at a similar distance , their boron abundance could differ from the local ( orion ) value on account of galactic abundance gradients .",
    "therefore , we adopt the local interstellar b abundance but recognize that it is a lower limit .",
    "assuming that the surface composition of a star reflects the composition of the gas from which it formed , the observed variations from star to star within an association can only be understood if the parent cloud was chemically inhomogeneous and/or its composition evolved and all the stars did not form at the same place and time . to interpret the various abundances of oxygen , iron and the light elements in the orion stars , one therefore has to determine the history and geometry of the chemical enrichment , or if one prefers , the distribution in both space and time of the different nucleosynthetic episodes .",
    "when a stellar association forms from the collapse of a chemically roughly homogeneous cloud , the first - generation stars have approximately the same composition .",
    "the most massive stars evolve quickly , on timescales of a few million years , and explode as sn ii which release in the ambient medium several solar masses of enriched material , notably more than 1  of pure oxygen per sn ii .",
    "in addition to this direct contamination of the gas , the sn ii s have a strong dynamical influence on the ambient medium : they produce a shock wave which accelerates particles to relativistic energies and they compress the surrounding gas .",
    "both theoretical models and direct observation indicate that the explosion of a sn ii within , or close to , a molecular cloud can trigger the fragmentation of the gas and lead to further star formation . depending on the mixing of the sn ii ejecta with the ambient , chemically unperturbed , gas",
    "the new stars formed in the wake of previous sn ii can show various o abundances , bounded from below by the initial ism o abundance and from above by the o abundance in the ejecta .",
    "the overabundance of oxygen in some stars of an association can thus be attributed to the _ self_-enrichment of the molecular cloud .",
    "note that in this model the o abundance varies in time , as more and more sn ii s explode and release o - rich material in the ambient medium , but also from one place to another as the hazards of mixing and gas fragmentation dictate .",
    "of course , one can not expect to model the orion clouds in sufficient detail to determine the distribution of abundances , density and other physical parameters over the whole region , and we must limit ourselves to general trends and average numbers .    to describe the variation of o abundances in orion , we divide the gas into two distinct components : the ejecta and the uncontaminated ism , which we simply call here the _ ambient medium_. this simple model considers addition of ejecta of mass @xmath35 to ambient material of mass @xmath36 to provide a total mass @xmath37 from which stars form .",
    "if @xmath38 denotes the mass fraction of element @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the composition of a star formed from the mixed gas of mass @xmath41 is given by    @xmath42    the relation between the b and o abundances in orion can be investigated using the simple model described above , in which new stars form from various amounts of two chemically distinct gas components ( the sn ii ejecta and the ` ambient ' medium ) before they are fully mixed and their compositions get homogenized .",
    "combining eq .",
    "( 2 ) for o and b , one can eliminate the mixing parameter , @xmath43 , and obtain :    @xmath44 ,      \\label{eq : b(o)}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45    alternatively , by exchanging @xmath43 and @xmath46 as well as @xmath47 and @xmath48 in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and  ( 3 ) , we have :    @xmath49 ,      \\label{eq : b(o)bis}\\ ] ]    from eqs .",
    "( 3 ) or  ( 5 ) , we see that the b abundance in orion stars can be either correlated or anticorrelated with o , depending on whether the slope @xmath50 is positive or negative , respectively .",
    "the anticorrelation reported in this paper is thus compatible with our simple ` mixing model ' if @xmath51 ( since @xmath52 ) .",
    "this is true if the @xmath3-process for @xmath4b production is negligible , since in that case @xmath53 .",
    "such a conclusion would be very important for the light element nucleosynthesis , since the @xmath3-process is generally invoked to increase the b / be and @xmath4b/@xmath5b ratios produced by standard ( high energy ) nucleo - spallation processes ( cf .",
    "introduction ) .",
    "if the orion observations can be used to rule out the @xmath3-process , then it seems inevitable that a low - energy cosmic ray component ( lecr ) exists in the ism , whose nature and origin remains to be determined .    if we identify the most o - poor ( log @xmath1(o ) = 8.3 ) star and",
    "the most o - rich ( log @xmath1(o ) = 9.1 ) star as having formed from the ( initial ) ambient and the most severely contaminated mixed gas , respectively , @xmath54 is given approximately by the ratio of the observed abundances of the most oxygen - rich to oxygen poor stars ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "( the qualification ` approximately ' is necessary because the equation is framed in terms of mass fractions but the spectroscopic analyses provide the o / h ratio subject to assumptions about the chemical composition , especially about the he / h ratio , and , in the case of the bi line in f - g stars , about the mg / h ratio ( cunha & smith 1999 ) . )    in order for b and o to be anticorrelated , the snii ejecta must have a b / o ratio that is less than the ambient material .",
    "the limiting case obviously occurs when the ejecta are thoroughly depleted in b and rich in o , a condition that denies the @xmath3-process a significant role in the synthesis of b. in such a case ,    @xmath56    the maximum observed value of @xmath54 @xmath10 6.3 can be used to set a lower limit on the ratio @xmath57 ( the lower limit would be this value if the star were composed purely of sn ii ejecta ) .",
    "if a ratio @xmath57 is assumed , eq .",
    "2 gives an estimate of @xmath43 that may be used in eq .",
    "6 to calculate the reduction in the b abundance between the initial ambient gas and the most heavily contaminated star .",
    "obviously , the greater the ratio @xmath57 , the smaller the reduction of the b abundance . for an arbitrary value of @xmath57 = 7 ( slightly larger than the lower limit of 6.3 ) and @xmath58",
    "( see above ) , @xmath43 = 0.83 and the observed b abundance in such a star would be @xmath59 ( a reduction of about 0.8 dex , which is roughly that observed ) .",
    "a value of @xmath60 is not an unreasonable value for a type ii supernova , where 1@xmath61 of oxygen may be synthesized and ejecta may amount to 10@xmath61 . in this model , there is no constraint that the b - reduction must approximately equal the o - increase .",
    "for example , if @xmath57 is raised to 10 , the b reduction is only 0.25 dex .",
    "this exercise does not address the feasibility of retention of an adequate mass of snii ejecta by gas that will subsequently form the stars with oxygen abundances above ambient values .",
    "this interesting issue which was aired by cunha & lambert ( 1992 ) may be bypassed here ; a more compelling challenge to this simple explanation of the o versus b anticorrelation must be faced .    in the simple mixing model presented here ,",
    "if b is not synthesized in significant amounts by the @xmath3-process , then possibly @xmath7li is not produced either .",
    "in such a case , the li and b abundances should be correlated and decline in tandem with increasing o abundance .",
    "lithium is not detectable in b - type stars .",
    "lithium and oxygen abundances of the f - g stars were derived by cunha et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "figure 7 shows that the lithium abundances are nearly independent of the o abundances , with perhaps a slight decrease . a simple , but by no means unique",
    ", interpretation is that synthesis of li accompanies the o synthesis .",
    "however , the interpretation of li abundances is complicated by the possibility that li is destroyed within stars .",
    "it is important to note that in figure 7 no undepleted li abundances are measured below log @xmath1(o)=8.7 .",
    "there is a tendency for the orion stars with lower oxygen abundances to have lower li abundances : these stars are older , tend to rotate more slowly , and have probably depleted their initial li abundances ( cunha et al .",
    "1995 ) . in order to properly place li within the context of the evolution of b and o in orion",
    ", it will be necessary to measure the behavior of undepleted li abundances in orion members with lower oxygen abundances .",
    "although the absence of a significant @xmath3-process is a sufficient condition for a local anticorrelation between b and o , we draw attention to the fact that it is not a necessary condition . in a model advocated by parizot ( 2000 ) , energetic particles ( sbeps ) accelerated inside a superbubble created by repeated snii s in an ob association may be responsible for synthesis of li , be , and b in a supershell .",
    "the geometry of the orion - eridanus superbubble ( see e.g. burrows et al .",
    "1993 ) is such that the orion clouds themselves can actually be considered as part of the supershell .",
    "indeed , the history of star formation in orion indicates that the molecular cloud is ` eroded ' from the side which faces the orion - eridanus superbubble , and a star formation wave propagates deeper and deeper into the cloud .",
    "now this star - forming side of the cloud is irradiated by sbeps ( parizot 1998 ) and an overabundance of spallation products like be and b is to be expected there .",
    "therefore , the ` ambient gas ' component in eq .",
    "( 2 ) could be very much enriched in li , be and b. this makes it possible that the resulting b abundance , @xmath62 , is greater than @xmath63 even in the presence of a significant @xmath3-process . from the astrophysical point of view , it depends on the penetration of the sbeps inside the orion clouds .",
    "the more they penetrate , the less @xmath62 , since the b production is then distributed over a larger volume .",
    "as recalled in the introduction , theoretical studies of light element production have up to now confined themselves to the interpretation of the _ general _ increase of libeb abundances as a function of metallicity . on local scales",
    ", complex behaviors may result from the fact that cno and libeb are not necessarily produced at exactly the same place or at the same time .",
    "indeed , before the local production of b and o , say , effectively results in a global increase of the b and o abundances in the ism , the o - rich and b - rich material have to mix together and with the rest of the ism . now",
    "if new stars form before , or during this mixing episode , one should expect them to show quite unusual compositions .",
    "therefore , it is not obvious that the _ local _ b - o anticorrelation found in orion is contradictory with the results obtained on the galactic scale . in a recent study , parizot & drury ( 2000 ) have addressed the question of a possible scatter in the be / o and b / o ratios in the galaxy , across a mean value accounted for by the superbubble model .",
    "the idea was very similar : because o and beb are not produced ( or released ) together in superbubbles , various elemental ratios can actually result from inhomogeneous mixing of the o - rich gas with the beb - rich material .",
    "observational evidence of such a scatter in the be data is available in boesgaard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "detailed calculations of the expected values for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , as well as the implications of the orion data for the sb model will be presented in paper  ii . here , we have noted that the observed b - o anticorrelation can be accounted for within a simple self - enrichment model .",
    "first , if the @xmath3-process is negligible , the anti - correlation is an inevitable prediction of the model .",
    "second , if the @xmath3-process proves to be significant , the observed anticorrelation simply means that @xmath64 , which is at least plausible considering the very high local production of b from sbeps ( see paper  ii for more details and quantitative estimates ) .",
    "finally , it is important to realize that the orion observations can actually be used to constrain the light element production models . although the b - o anticorrelation alone can not be used to determine the weight of the @xmath3-process in the galaxy , a joint study of the be abundances should give decisive information . since be is not expected to be a @xmath3-process product and is then solely a fruit of spallation , it can be used to set the parameters of the sb and the mixing models .",
    "any difference between be and b can then be attributed to the @xmath3-process , and serve to quantify it .",
    "we predict that be will also be found anticorrelated with o in the orion association , and _ even more _ than b. this is because b is produced by two means : nucleo - spallation , which leads to the anticorrelation , and neutrino - spallation , which alone would lead to a b - o positive correlation , since the boron produced in this way is ` ready - mixed ' with the oxygen in the sn ii ejecta .",
    "since the @xmath3-process is irrelevant for be , the ` slope ' of the be - o anticorrelation must be at least equal , and possibly greater ( in absolute value ) than that of the b - o anticorrelation .",
    "note that the slopes are here the ones described by eq .",
    "( 3 ) , namely @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( which should actually be normalized by dividing them by @xmath67 , say , and @xmath68 , respectively ) .",
    "this is different from the slope seen in figure  4 , where the abundances are plotted on logarithmic scales .",
    "it is remarkable , however , that the only anticorrelation in logarithmic variables which is compatible with a anticorrelation in linear variables ( as predicted by the mixing model , eq .  ( 3 ) , is one of slope @xmath69 , which is what we observe for orion .    finally , the case of lithium is more complicated , since the galactic evolution models indicate that the spallation processes may not be the main contributors , and agb stars probably produced most of the li currently observed in the galaxy .",
    "the absence of a clear correlation or anticorrelation found in figure 7 could thus result from the fact that the @xmath3-process is roughly balanced by the sbep - induced production , or by the fact that none of these processes modifies significantly the li abundance in the ejecta and the ambient medium .",
