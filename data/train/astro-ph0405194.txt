    "since the discovery of the first binary pulsar ( hulse & taylor 1975 ) , the detection of two active pulsars in the same binary system has been a primary aim of any pulsar survey .",
    "we here summarize the basic steps which eventually led to the discovery of this long - sought system and report on the first implications for gravitational waves detection .",
    "papers by kramer et al . and manchester et al .",
    "( in these proceedings ) will give more details on the second discovered pulsar , dealing with the opportunity to use this binary as a magnificent laboratory of relativistic gravity and for investigating magnetospheric processes .",
    "psr  j0737@xmath03039a , a millisecond pulsar with a spin period of @xmath1 ms , was discovered in april 2003 ( burgay et al . 2003 ) in a 4-minute pointing of the parkes high - latitude pulsar survey ( burgay et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the original detection plot is shown in figure 1 , reporting a signal - to - noise ratio of 18.7 . a higher signal - to - noise ratio of 26.3 resulted from the same observation for the first harmonics of the pulse period ( @xmath2 ms ) , due to the similar energy contribution and roughly half - phase separation of the two peaks of the profile displayed in figure 1 ; the pulse period ambiguity was easily solved as soon as further longer observations became available ( a high resolution pulse profile for psr  j0737@xmath03039a is presented in manchester et al .",
    "2004 , these proceedings ) .    from the very pronounced curvature in the spin phase vs sub - integrations box ( central panel on the left of the figure 1 ) ,",
    "denoting a time depending change in the phase of arrival of the pulses , it was immediately clear that the pulsar signal was affected by a significant doppler effect .",
    "that in turn suggested that the pulsar was experiencing the gravitational pull of a nearby and relatively massive companion .    using a code suitable for searching strongly accelerated pulsars",
    ", we found the best correction to the doppler phase shift for an acceleration of 99 m / s@xmath3 suggesting a binary period of just few hours for a companion of @xmath4 .",
    "follow - up observations performed in may 2004 , consisting of three @xmath5-hour integrations , confirmed that the orbit is indeed very tight and far from being circular : the binary period @xmath6 is only 2.4 hr and the eccentricity @xmath7 .",
    "this makes j0737@xmath03039a s orbit the tightest among those of all known binary pulsars in eccentric systems .",
    "figure 2 shows the radial velocity curve obtained plotting the barycentric spin period of the pulsar , measured at different times , versus the binary phase : the fact that the orbit is eccentric is easily seen from the asymmetric shape of the curve",
    ".    from the approximate orbital parameters available after two days of follow - up observations ( @xmath8 hr,@xmath9 lt - s ; for the current best estimates of these parameters see table 1 in kramer et al .",
    ", these proceedings ) , the pulsar mass function was calculated and resulted @xmath10 m@xmath11 implying a minimum companion mass of about 1.24 m@xmath12 , assuming @xmath13m@xmath12 . according to this mass , the companion star could be a non degenerate object , a massive carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( co - wd ) or a second neutron star . the first hypothesis was immediately ruled out since the radius of a non degenerate object of the required mass would almost completely fill the orbit of the system , probably strongly affecting the radio emission , which is not seen in the signal of psr  j0737@xmath03039a . on the other hand , also the co - wd scenario appeared unlikely considering the eccentricity of the orbit : a binary containing a recycled neutron star and a white dwarf is indeed expected to be highly circular since it had the time to reach the minimum energy configuration ( i.e. to circularise ) .",
    "if a second , recent supernova explosion has occurred forming another neutron star , the energy and momentum released can have distorted the system and this would explain the observed eccentricity .    a further strong constraint on the nature of psr  j0737@xmath03039a companion came few days later from the first fit of a binary model to the times of arrival of the pulsations .",
    "by using a data span of only 6 days , a 10-@xmath14 determination of the advance of the periastron , @xmath15 , was possible .",
    "this parameter resulted to have a remarkably high value : @xmath16yr ( note that the the previously highest observed value was @xmath17yr , for psr  j1141@xmath06545 , kaspi et al .",
    "if interpreted in the framework of general relativity , the measured value of @xmath15 implied a total mass for the system containing psr  j0737@xmath03039a of about 2.58 m@xmath12 giving a maximum mass for the pulsar of about 1.34 m@xmath12 and a minimum mass for the companion @xmath18 m@xmath12 .",
    "while the maximum mass for the pulsar perfectly agrees with the other measurements of neutron star masses ( thorsett & chakrabarty 1999 ) , the mass of the companion is a little lower than average . in absence of additional information",
    "the white dwarf hypothesis could not be completely rejected .",
    "it is important to point out , anyway , that the @xmath15 value that one measures , in general , is given by the term of equation 1 plus two classical extra terms , arising _ (",
    "i ) _ from tidal deformations of the companion star ( relevant only if the companion is non degenerate ) and _ ( ii ) _ from rotationally induced quadrupole moment of the companion star , applicable to the case of a fast rotating white dwarf . for a neutron star",
    "both the additional contributions are negligible .",
    "if the companion to j0737@xmath03039a was a white dwarf the relativistic @xmath15 , and by consequence the total system mass , would be smaller than the measured one ( since @xmath19 ) implying an implausibly small ( @xmath20 m@xmath12 ) maximum allowed mass for j0737@xmath03039a ( that , being a pulsar , is certainly a neutron star ) .",
    "all these pieces of evidence strongly suggested that the discovered binary was the sixth , and by far the most relativistic , double neutron star ( dns ) system known .",
    "the ultimate confirmation of the above picture came few months later when , analysing the follow - up observations of psr  j0737@xmath03039a , a strong signal with a repetition period of @xmath21 2.8 seconds occasionally appeared ( lyne at al .",
    "the newly discovered pulsar , henceforth called psr  j0737@xmath03039b ( or simply ` b ' ) , had the same dispersion measure as psr  j0737@xmath03039a ( or ` a ' ) , and showed orbital doppler variations that identified it , without any doubt , as the companion to the millisecond pulsar .",
    "the first ever double pulsar system had been eventually discovered .",
    "in the binary system containing psr  j0737@xmath03039a and b , the relativistic effects are highly enhanced , thanks to its short orbital period and to its high orbital inclination .",
    "that makes it an excellent laboratory for studying relativistic gravity . using only the follow up observations of pulsar a ,",
    "we have been able , in less than a year of regular timing , to measure four post - keplerian parameters , whose values are listed in table 1 of kramer et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) : besides the already mentioned parameter @xmath15 , we have measured @xmath22 ( namely the term taking into account gravitational redshift and time dilation ) and the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the latter represent respectively the range and the shape of the shapiro delay , measuring the time delays of the signal caused by the space - time deformations around the companion star .",
    "having measured four pk - parameters , we succeeded in performing two independent tests of general relativity ( see kramer et al . for details ) after less than 8 months of observations using psr",
    "j0737@xmath03039a only .",
    "the fifth pk parameter , the orbital decay , should be determined within 2004 .",
    "the detectability of psr  j0737@xmath03039b makes this system even more promising , providing further unprecedented tests of gravity theories , as explained in the contribution of kramer et al . in this book",
    "the discovery of a binary system with the characteristics of j0737@xmath03039 implies a significant increase of the estimates of the double neutron stars ( dnss ) galactic coalescence rate @xmath25 ( burgay et al .",
    "2003 , kalogera et al . 2004 ) and , in turn , of the gravitational waves detection rate for ground based observatories such as ligo , geo and virgo .",
    "psr  j0737@xmath03039a and b will coalesce due to the emission of gravitational waves in a merger time @xmath26 myr , a timescale that is a factor 3.5 shorter than that for psr  b1913@xmath2716 ( taylor , fowler & mcculloch 1979 ) .",
    "in addition , the estimated distance for j0737@xmath03039 system ( @xmath28 pc with an intrinsic uncertainty of about 50% from the dispersion measure , @xmath29 kpc from x - ray absorption ) is an order of magnitude less than that of psr  b1913@xmath2716 .",
    "these properties have a substantial effect on the prediction of the rate of merging events in the galaxy .    for a given class @xmath30 of binary pulsars in the galaxy , in fact , apart from a beaming correction factor , the merger rate @xmath25@xmath31 is calculated ( kim , kalogera & lorimer 2003 ) as @xmath25@xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is the binary pulsar lifetime defined as the sum of the time since birth , @xmath34 , and the remaining time before coalescence , @xmath35 , whereas @xmath36 is the scaling factor defined as the number of binaries in the galaxy belonging to the given class .",
    "the value of @xmath37 for psr  j0737 - 3039a can be computed as the time since the pulsar left the spin - up line ( as calculated by arzoumanian , cordes & wasserman , 1999 ) and it results @xmath38 myr . alternatively one can assume that the characteristic age of pulsar b is a reliable estimate of the true age of both pulsars . in this case @xmath39 myr . in",
    "either cases the lifetime of psr  j0737@xmath03039 is much shorter than that of psr  b1913 + 16 ( @xmath40 , where the subscript numbers refer to the pulsars ) , implying roughly a doubling of the ratio @xmath25@xmath41@xmath42 .    a much more substantial contribution to the increase factor comes from the comparison of the pulsars luminosities .",
    "assuming conservatively a distance of 1 kpc ( as suggested by the x - ray observations ; mclaughlin et al .",
    "2004 ) , the pulsed luminosity at 400 mhz of j0737 - 3039 binary system results @xmath43 mjy kpc@xmath3 , much lower than that of psr  b1913@xmath2716 ( @xmath44 mjy kpc@xmath3 ) . for a planar homogeneous distribution of pulsars in the galaxy ,",
    "the ratio @xmath45 scales as @xmath46 .",
    "therefore we obtain @xmath25@xmath41@xmath47 . including the moderate contribution of the longer - lived psr  b1534 + 12 system to the total rate ( van den heuvel & lorimer 1996 , arzoumanian , cordes & wasserman 1999 , kalogera et al .",
    "2001 , kim , kalogera & lorimer 2003 ) , we obtain an increase factor for the total merger rate @xmath48@xmath49@xmath50@xmath51@xmath50@xmath52 of about an order of magnitude .",
    "similar results have been obtained by kim et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) with a different approach .",
    "this means that ground based gravitational wave detectors such as ligo , virgo or geo should be able to detect a burst of gravitational waves produced in a dns merger event once every few years instead than once in few decades , with important consequences for the gravitational wave community .",
