    "in the central region of a galaxy cluster , the radiative cooling time of intracluster medium ( icm ) is generally much smaller than the hubble time . in the absence of any heating sources",
    ", this means that the icm flows subsonically toward the cluster center with a mass deposition rate of @xmath6@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this flow had been known as a ` cooling flow ' . however , _",
    "asca _ and _ xmm - newton _ failed to detect emission from low temperature gas , implying that the actual cooling rate is at least 5 or 10 times smaller than that previously assumed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations strongly suggest that the mass deposition must be prevented by some additional source of heat that balances radiative losses .",
    "turbulence in the icm may work as a heating source . through turbulent mixing , it transfers thermal energy from the outer layer of a cluster into the core @xcite .",
    "dissipation of the turbulence can also heat the core . the evidence of turbulence has indirectly observed .",
    "for example , @xcite found that there is little evidence of resonant scattering in the perseus cluster , which suggests motion of the icm .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that bulk gas motion induced by cluster mergers and radiative cooling develop turbulence in and around a core .",
    "the reason is that the cool and dense core can not be moved by the bulk gas motion , and the resultant relative gas motion between the core and the surrounding icm leads to hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "the core is heated by the turbulence . since the turbulence is produced and the heating is effective only when the core is cooling and dense , fine - tuning of balance between cooling and heating is alleviated for this model . on the other hand , the activities of the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) at cluster centers",
    "may also create turbulence .",
    "in particular , the bubbles formed through the agn activities may move outward in the icm via buoyancy and may create turbulence behind them @xcite .",
    "these two types of turbulence have different features .",
    "the typical scale of the turbulence produced by the bulk gas motion in the icm is close to the size of a cluster core ( @xmath8  kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this scale is larger than the typical size of a bubble ( @xmath9  kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the bubble , if any , will be staggered in the velocity fields of the turbulence . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum scale of the turbulence produced by a buoyant bubble should be limited to the size of the bubble .",
    "since the bubble is the engine of the turbulence , its motion should not be affected much by the turbulence .",
    "recently , old bubbles have been observed in the x - ray and radio bands .",
    "they are located away from cluster centers . in the virgo cluster ,",
    "diffuse radio emission from possible old bubbles was observed at a distance of @xmath10  kpc from the cluster center @xcite . from x - ray observations , ` arms ' of cold gas have been found ; they might be cold gas entrained by the old bubbles from the cluster center @xcite .",
    "the arms may indicate the paths of the bubbles .",
    "for the perseus cluster , two bubble pairs ( four bubbles ) have been found by _",
    "chandra _ @xcite .",
    "while the inner pair is at @xmath11  kpc from the cluster center , the outer pair is at @xmath12  kpc .",
    "if a bubble pair is formed through agn jet activities , the initial positions of the two bubbles are expected to be symmetric about the cluster center , where the agn is located .",
    "there are several clusters for which high - resolution x - ray and radio observations were made and the positions of newborn twin bubbles were obtained . among such clusters , hydra  a , a2052 , m84 , cygnus  a , and centaurus respectively have two bubbles that are next to the central agns and the positions are consistent with being symmetric about the agns @xcite . on the other hand , the positions of the two inner bubbles in the perseus cluster do not appear to be symmetric about the agn ( the upper panel of fig .  1 in",
    "however , radio observations showed that the directions of jets are symmetric and a new bubble pair appears to be forming in those directions ( the upper panel of fig .  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "the complicated shapes of the inner bubbles may be due to the projection of a few bubble pairs .",
    "in contrast with the newborn bubbles , the positions of the old bubbles are not always symmetric about the cluster centers . for the virgo cluster ,",
    "the angle between the two arms is @xmath13 ( figure  1 [ upper right ] of @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the arms are not straight and they are bent at @xmath14  kpc @xcite . for the perseus cluster , although no clear arms have been observed , the angle between the two vectors from the cluster center to the two outer old bubbles is @xmath15 . in this letter , we study how the large - scale turbulence , which is not created by bubble motions , affects the motion of the bubbles and makes the observed asymmetries .",
    "we use the hubble constant of @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the gravitational potential of a cluster is spherically symmetric and the central agn creates two spherical bubbles near the cluster center . at @xmath17 , the bubbles are at a radius @xmath18 from the cluster center in the opposite directions with respect to the cluster center .",
    "each bubble moves outward in the cluster via buoyancy .",
    "the equation of motion for a bubble is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass of the bubble , @xmath21 is the velocity of the bubble , @xmath22 is the velocity of turbulence at the position of the bubble , @xmath23 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath24 is the radius of the bubble , and @xmath25 is the icm pressure at the position of the bubble .",
    "we assume that a bubble is adiabatic and in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding icm .",
    "thus , the radius of the bubble has the relation of @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the initial radius of the bubble , @xmath28 is the icm pressure at the position where the bubble is created , and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the adiabatic constant .    for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the turbulence has a monochromatic spectrum with a velocity of @xmath31 and a spatial scale of @xmath32 .",
    "we divide a cluster into small cubes with a side of @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that in each cube , the velocity field of the icm is uniform , that is , the velocity and the direction are constant .",
    "the direction has no correlation among the cubes .    for parameters of a model cluster",
    ", we use the results of _ xmm - newton _ observations of the perseus cluster .",
    "we chose the cluster because there were a few studies about turbulence in the cluster @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained the density and temperature profiles of the cluster ( their equations  [ 4 ] and  [ 5 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the icm is in pressure equilibrium , because the velocity of the turbulence is smaller than the sound velocity of the icm . from the density and temperature profiles , ignoring the self - gravity of the icm , we derived the mass profile of the cluster , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the distance from the cluster center .",
    "we assume that the initial radii of bubbles are @xmath35  kpc and their initial positions are @xmath36  kpc .",
    "the bubble mass , @xmath37 , is 0.01 times the mass of the ambient gas with the same volume .",
    "the results are not sensitive to @xmath20 , as long as it is small .",
    "we calculated the motion of bubbles for several kinds of turbulence . since @xmath38  kpc , we limited @xmath32 to be @xmath39  kpc .",
    "the model parameters are shown in table  [ tab : model ] .",
    "they are based on the results of numerical simulations of a cluster core @xcite .",
    "other studies also suggested the existence of similar velocity fields in cluster cores .",
    "@xcite studied the balance between turbulent heating and radiative cooling in clusters . comparing their model with observations",
    ", they concluded that @xmath40 if @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43  kpc .",
    "@xcite also obtained the values similar to those shown in table  1 from the observed metal distribution in the core of the perseus cluster .",
    "note that while the method invented by @xcite measures the velocity fields averaged on a time - scale of @xmath44  gyr ( the time - scale of metal ejection from stars ) , our method measures those averaged on a time - scale of @xmath45  gyr ( the age of bubbles ; see below ) .",
    "since the expansion velocity of a bubble at the formation is larger than @xmath31 in table  [ tab : model ] ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we assume that the initial velocity of the bubbles is @xmath46 . for each turbulence model , we randomly chose the initial direction of the line connecting the two bubbles , the position of the cluster center in the cube that contains the cluster center , and the viewing angle ; they are independent each other . for each model",
    ", we calculated the motions of 10,000 bubble pairs and their projected positions at @xmath47  yr .",
    "figure  [ fig : path ] shows the projected trajectories of five randomly selected bubble pairs for @xmath48  kpc and @xmath49 ( model  a2 ) .",
    "the end points correspond to @xmath47  yr .",
    "we found that the bubbles reach projected distances of @xmath5050  kpc from the cluster center , which are similar to the positions of the outer bubbles observed in the perseus cluster ( 33 and  38  kpc ) .",
    "although there are exceptions , the bubbles move fairly straight from their departure points ( at least not zigzag ) , because @xmath31 is smaller than the velocity driven by buoyancy alone ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "this is almost the same for other models except for model  b2 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : angle ] shows the distributions of the projected angle @xmath53 between the two vectors from the cluster center to the two bubbles composing a pair . if the two bubbles are located in the opposite directions with respect to the cluster center , @xmath54 . in model  a2 , for example ,",
    "about 90% of bubble pairs have @xmath55 .",
    "the angle @xmath53 has a wider distribution for larger @xmath31 and @xmath32 because the bubbles are scattered more effectively by the turbulence .",
    "this scatter works as diffusion in the @xmath53-space .",
    "medians of the angle are @xmath56@xmath57 except for model  b1 ( table  [ tab : model ] ) . in model  b1 ,",
    "almost all bubble pairs have @xmath58 , because @xmath31 is much smaller than the velocity driven by buoyancy . in model",
    "b2 , there is no preferential angle ( figure  [ fig : angle]b ) . for the perseus cluster ,",
    "the angle between the two outer bubbles is @xmath59 . in table",
    "[ tab : model ] , we show the fraction of bubble pairs with @xmath60 .",
    "the values of @xmath61 indicate that the angle distributions of all the models except for  model  b1 are consistent with the observation . in model  b1 ,",
    "the value of @xmath53 for the perseus cluster is unacceptably small ( the probability is @xmath621% ) , which means that @xmath31 is too small to account for the observation .",
    "for the cluster , @xmath63 is required , which could be detected by _",
    "we refer to @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) as the projected distances of the two bubbles composing a pair from the cluster center .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratio ] shows the distributions of the radio @xmath66 . in model",
    "a2 , for example , about 90% of bubble pairs have @xmath67 .",
    "as is the case of @xmath53 , the ratio has a wider distribution for larger @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "medians of the ratio , @xmath68 , are also shown in table  [ tab : model ] .",
    "for the two outer bubbles in the perseus cluster , the ratio is 1.15 , and the fractions of bubble pairs with a ratio larger than this , @xmath69 , are shown in table  [ tab : model ] .",
    "all models are consistent with the observation , although model  b1 is less preferable .",
    "we also studied the two dimensional distributions of @xmath53 and @xmath70 .",
    "we found no strong correlation between them .    since the effective diffusion coefficient for the bubble motion",
    "is represented by @xmath71 , models  a3 and  b2 have the same coefficient . however , the angle and ratio distributions of the two models are different ( figures  [ fig : angle ] and  [ fig : ratio ] ) ; those of model  a3 have narrower distributions .",
    "this is because for model  a3 the turbulent velocity , @xmath31 , is much smaller than the buoyant velocity , and thus the final positions of the bubbles are mainly determined by buoyancy . in the future , with more observations about the positions of old bubbles in clusters , we could more tightly constrain the typical velocity and scale of turbulence in cluster cores .",
    "we note that the systematic motion of the cd galaxy containing an agn with respect to the icm , @xmath72 , may affect the asymmetry of bubble positions . on the frame that moves with the cd galaxy ,",
    "this can be studied as the case of @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "our results may indicate that @xmath75 for the perseus cluster , and this could be observed by _ suzaku _ as the shift of metal lines from the optical redshift of the cd galaxy .",
    "since the observed bubbles are inside the potential wells of cd galaxies , the aspherical potential of a cd galaxy could also affect of the asymmetry of bubble positions .",
    "the former could be measured from the optical image of the galaxy . for the perseus cluster ,",
    "the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis in a red color is @xmath76 , which does not affect the results above .",
    "using a simple model , we have investigated the turbulence at scales larger than the size of bubbles observed in cool cores of galaxy clusters .",
    "we showed that for a bubble pair , which was created by agn jet activities @xmath77  yrs ago , the projected angle between the two vectors from the cluster center to the two bubbles should be @xmath78 , and the ratio of their projected distances from the cluster center should be @xmath79 , if the velocity and scale of turbulence are @xmath80 and @xmath4  kpc , respectively .",
    "the positions of the bubbles observed in the perseus cluster indicate that the velocity is @xmath81 for the cluster .",
    "this turbulence could directly be detected by _",
    "@xcite indicated that the icm is not turbulent at the scale of @xmath82  kpc .",
    "detailed observations of x - ray spectra may reveal the lower limit of the scale of turbulence @xcite , which might be determined by the viscosity of the icm @xcite .",
