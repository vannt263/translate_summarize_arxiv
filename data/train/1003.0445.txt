    "an important topic in modern wireless communications is the subject of decentralized networks . by definition , a decentralized network of separate transmitter - receiver pairs",
    "has no central controller to allocate the network resources among the active users .",
    "as such , resource allocation must be performed locally at each node . in general , users are not already aware of the number of active users and the channel gains . also , users are not aware of each other s codebooks implying multiuser detection is not possible , i.e. , users treat each other as noise .",
    "multiuser interference is known to be the main factor limiting the achievable rates in such networks particularly in the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) or interference limited regime .",
    "therefore , all users must follow a distributed signaling scheme such that the destructive effect of interference on each user is minimized , while the resources are fairly shared among users .",
    "most of distributed schemes reported in the literature rely on either _ game - theoretic _ approaches or _ cognitive radios_. cognitive radios @xcite have the ability to sense the unoccupied portion of the available spectrum and use this information in resource allocation .",
    "although such smart radios avoid the use of a central controller , they require sophisticated detection techniques for sensing the spectrum holes and dynamic frequency assignment which add to the overall system complexity @xcite",
    ".    distributed strategies based on game theoretic arguments have already attracted a great deal of attention . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors introduce a non - cooperative game theoretic framework to investigate the spectral efficiency issue when several users compete over an unlicensed band with no central controller .",
    "reference @xcite offers a brief overview of game theoretic dynamic spectrum sharing . although these schemes enable us to understand the dynamics of distributed resource allocation , they usually suffer from complexity in software and convergence issues as they rely on iterative algorithms .",
    "spread spectrum communications is a natural setup to share the same bandwidth by several users .",
    "this area has attracted tremendous attention by different authors during the past decades in the context of centralized uplink / downlink multiuser systems .",
    "appealing characteristics of spread spectrum systems have motivated researchers to utilize these schemes in networks without a certain infrastructure , i.e. , packet radio or ad - hoc networks@xcite . in direct sequence spread spectrum systems ,",
    "the signal of each user is spread using a pseudo - random noise ( pn ) code .",
    "the challenging point is that in a network without a central controller , if two users use the same spreading code , they will not be capable of recovering the data at the receiver side due to the high amount of interference .",
    "distributed code assignment techniques are developed in @xcite . in @xcite , using a greedy approximation algorithm and invoking graph theory , a distributed code assignment protocol is suggested .",
    "another category of research is devoted to devise distributed schemes in the reverse link ( uplink ) of cellular systems .",
    "distributed power assignments algorithms are proposed in @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite proposes a distributed scheduling method called the token - bucket on - off scenario utilized by autonomous mobile stations where its impact on the overall throughput of the reverse link is investigated . furthermore ,",
    "decentralized rate assignments in a multi - sector code division multiple access wireless network are discussed in @xcite .",
    "being a standard technique in spread spectrum communications and due to its interference avoidance nature , frequency hopping is the simplest spectrum sharing method to use in decentralized networks .",
    "as different users typically have no prior information about the codebooks of the other users , the most efficient method is avoiding interference by choosing unused channels . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "searching the spectrum to find spectrum holes is not an easy task due to the dynamic spectrum usage . as such",
    ", fh is a realization of a transmission scheme without sensing , while avoiding the collisions as much as possible .",
    "frequency hopping is one of the standard signaling schemes adopted in ad - hoc networks . in short range scenarios , bluetooth systems @xcite are the most popular examples of a wireless personal area network or wpan .",
    "using fh over the unlicensed ism band , a bluetooth system provides robust communication to unpredictable sources of interference .",
    "a modification of frequency hopping called dynamic frequency hopping ( dfh ) , selects the hopping pattern based on interference measurements in order to avoid dominant interferers .",
    "the performance of a dfh scheme when applied to a cellular system is assessed in @xcite .",
    "distributed rate assignment strategies are recently adopted in the context of medium access control .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that the capacity region @xmath1 of a multiple access channel with @xmath2 users is a polytope with a @xmath3 corner points .",
    "let each corner point of @xmath1 be an @xmath2-tuple whose elements are among the numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 . with no cooperation among the users , the authors in @xcite",
    "propose that each user selects a codebook of rate @xmath6 with probability @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "assuming the receiver is aware of the rate selection of all users , the average sum rate of the network is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is @xmath11 if @xmath12 and @xmath13 otherwise .",
    "finally , the numbers @xmath14 and @xmath15 are derived to maximize @xmath16 .",
    "major differences of this scenario with a decentralized wireless network are    _ 1 ) _ the capacity region of a multiuser interference channel is unknown .    _ 2 ) _ in case transmitters have different choices to select the transmission rate , a certain receiver is not guaranteed to be aware of the transmission rate of interferers .    _ 3 ) _ any user is already unaware of the gains of channels connecting the interferers transmitters to its receiver . also , any user is never capable of finding the amount of interference it imposes on other users .",
    "it is well - known that in the low snr regime continuous transmission of @xmath17 gaussian signals is optimal .",
    "however , as snr increases , this scheme turns out to be quite inefficient . for instance",
    ", the achievable rate of each user eventually saturates , i.e. , the achieved sum multiplexing gain as snr tends to infinity . ]",
    "( smg ) is equal to zero .",
    "using the results in @xcite , it is easy to see that by using a masking strategy where each user quits transmitting its gaussian signals independently from transmission to transmission , a nonzero smg of @xmath18 is attained in a decentralized network of @xmath2 users",
    ". this is an interesting result in the sense that if the number of active users tends to infinity , the achieved smg settles on @xmath19 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we answer the following questions :    _ question 1- _ is it possible to achieve an smg larger than @xmath20 as the number of users becomes large ?    we propose a distributed signaling scheme where each user spread its gaussian signal along a spreading code consisting of @xmath17 elements selected according a globally known probability mass function ( pmf ) over a finite alphabet @xmath21 .",
    "thereafter , the resulting sequence is punctured independently from symbol to symbol with a certain probability representing the masking operation .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath22 , let the generated spreading code have length @xmath23 and be given by @xmath24 also , an @xmath17 sequence of @xmath11 s ( representing @xmath25 ) and @xmath13 s ( representing @xmath26 ) with length @xmath23 is generated as @xmath27 finally , denoting the gaussian signal to be transmitted by @xmath28 , the sequence @xmath29 is transmitted in @xmath23 consecutive transmission slots called a transmission frame .",
    "this process is repeated independently from transmission frame to transmission frame .",
    "we notice that since different users are not aware of each other s signals and the spreading / masking sequences , the noise plus interference vector at the receive side of any user is a mixed gaussian random vector .",
    "we assume the knowledge of interference probability density function ( pdf ) at the receiver side of each user .",
    "we are able to see that using the proposed randomized spreading scheme , the number of active users and the gains of channels conveying the interferers signals can be easily found by inspecting the interference pdf and solving a set of linear equation .    assuming all users are _ frame - synchronous _ , we derive achievable rates for the users in three steps :    _ step 1- _ using singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the signal space at the receiver side any user , the interference vector is mapped in the signal space and the complement space and a subspace @xmath30 of @xmath31 , the complement space @xmath32 of @xmath30 is the set of elements in @xmath31 that are perpendicular to any element in @xmath30 . ] of the signal space .    _",
    "step 2- _ a conditional version of entropy power inequality is used to derive a lower bound on the mutual information between the input and output of each user along any transmission frame .",
    "the conditioning is made over the contents of the interference vector mapped in the complement space of the signal space .",
    "_ step 3- _ the resulting lower bound in the previous step highly depends on the differential entropy of mixed gaussian random vectors . since there is no closed formula on the differential entropy of a mixed gaussian vector , a key lemma is used to find computable bounds on this differential entropy .",
    "this leads us to the final formulation of the achievable rate .    in a decentralized network of @xmath2 users",
    ", we are able to show that by regulating the length of the transmission frame and the probabilistic structure of the spreading / masking sequences , the resulting lower bound scales like @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "this is exactly the smg of a centralized orthogonal resource allocation scheme where multiuser interference is completely avoided .",
    "our focus is not particularly on the high snr regime .",
    "in fact , the length of the transmission frame and the probabilistic parameters of the spreading / masking codes are sensitive to the choice of snr .",
    "our proposed achievable rate for any user in general depends on the gains of the channels conveying the interference . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "each user is capable of finding the channel gains , however , if each user attempts to maximize its achievable rate over the length of the transmission frame and other code parameters , different users come up with different choices which results in inconsistency . to circumvent this difficulty , assuming the channel gains are realizations of @xmath17 continuous random variables , each user selects the code parameters such that the average of achievable rate per user over different realizations of the channel gains is maximized .",
    "this leads to a consistent and distributed method to design the best randomization algorithm in constructing the spreading / masking sequences .",
    "an interesting observation is that even in the simplest scenario where the underlying alphabet is @xmath0 and no masking is applied , the elements of the spreading codes are not equiprobable over @xmath0 .",
    "for example , our simulation results show that in a network of @xmath35 users at @xmath36 , the elements of the spreading code must be selected to be @xmath11 with a probability of @xmath37 and @xmath38 with a probability of @xmath39 or vice versa .",
    "_ question 2- _ what is the highest achievable rate under the masking protocol ?",
    "can one do better than masking ?",
    "one may raise the question if masking the transmitted signals independently from transmission slot to transmission slot is by itself sufficient , i.e. , by selecting the pdf of the transmitted signals properly ( probably non - gaussian ) , there is no need for spreading . using an extremal inequality of liu - viswanath @xcite , we are able to show that transmission of gaussian signals along with spreading and masking yields higher achievable rates that the largest achievable rate with masking alone .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii offers the system model . in this section",
    ", we introduce the randomized spreading coding and discuss how all user can consistently design their spreading / masking sequences .",
    "section iii presents the development of achievable rates based on the three steps mentioned earlier .",
    "system design is brought in section iv where we offer several design examples .",
    "finally , section v prove the supremacy of blending spreading and masking over masking alone .",

    "there is no central controller to manage the network resources among users , resource allocation and rate assignment must be performed locally at every transmitter .",

    "this is not necessarily a valid assumption in a decentralized network , however , this makes the presentation of the subject much easier .",
    "it is clear that the transmitted signals of each user along its transmission frames are correlated while signals transmitted in different transmission frames are independent .",
