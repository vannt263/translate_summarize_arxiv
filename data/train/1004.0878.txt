    "a generic problem in cellular biochemistry is to estimate the time - the so - called narrow escape time ( net ) - that a randomly moving particle spends in a bounded domain before it escapes through a small window in the domain s boundary . a particle can be an ion , a ligand , a molecule , a protein , etc .",
    "a confining domain can be a cell , a microvesicle , a compartment , an endosome , a caveola , a dendritic spine , etc .",
    "a variety of processes in which the importance of the net problem is striking were discussed in @xcite .",
    "conventional analytical calculations of the net rely on the assumption that the confining surface is perfectly reflecting everywhere , except for the escape window - an aperture of typical size @xmath1 . for brownian motion , evaluation of the net probability density function ( pdf )",
    "@xmath2 amounts to finding the solution of the diffusion equation with mixed dirichlet - neumann boundary conditions @xcite .    in three - dimensions ( 3d )",
    "one finds @xcite that at sufficiently large times the probability @xmath3 that the particle has not reached the escape window up to time @xmath4 obeys @xmath5 where the symbol `` @xmath6 '' signifies that one deals with the leading in time asymptotic behavior and omits the numerical prefactors .",
    "the characteristic decay time @xmath7 ( the subscript `` 3d '' specifies that the search for the escape window proceeds via the bulk diffusion ) in eq .",
    "[ classic ] is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the volume of the domain and @xmath10 is the bulk diffusion coefficient .",
    "this result holds for any 3d bounded domain , provided that the boundary is sufficiently smooth and the ratio @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the typical size of the domain , is sufficiently small .",
    "the pdf @xmath2 than follows via the relation @xmath13 .",
    "hence , @xmath7 in eq .",
    "[ net ] can be interpreted as the mean time of the first passage to the escape window - the mean narrow - escape time .",
    "note that the results in eqs .",
    "[ classic][net ] have been obtained earlier in @xcite and @xcite in the special case of a sphere of radius @xmath12 and the escape window being a geodesic disc of radius @xmath1 , @xmath14 .",
    "to get some idea of typical net scales , consider an example mentioned in @xcite - search for the tubule entrance in a vesicle by a diffusive ligand .",
    "the vesicle size @xmath12 and the radius of the tubule entrance @xmath1 are of order of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , while the ligand diffusion coefficient @xmath10 is in the range @xmath17 .",
    "thus @xmath7 is of order of @xmath18 to @xmath19 seconds , depending on the value of the bulk diffusion coefficient .",
    "of course , one may encounter considerably larger first passage times for larger @xmath12 or smaller @xmath1 , as well as under conditions of molecular crowding emerging due to complexity of the cellular environment . in the latter case",
    ", an effectively subdiffusive motion can emerge @xcite .",
    "on contrary , interactions of particles with molecular motors may induce an effective biased motion and thus reduce the net .    the analysis based on the `` perfectly reflecting wall '' assumption misses an important factor .",
    "in realistic systems , in addition to the short - range repulsion , there are always some attractive interactions between the surface of the domain and the diffusive particle . capitalizing on ideas of adam and delbrck , put forward for chemoreception @xcite",
    "( see also the discussion in @xcite ) , one may suppose that if such interactions are sufficiently strong , the actual search for the escape window will be a two - stage process , in which the particle will first find the surface of the cell and then will move diffusively along the surface until it finds the escape window .",
    "consequently , one may expect that in this two - stage process the rate at which the escape window is found ( and correspondingly , the apparent narrow escape time @xmath0 ) will increase ( decrease ) by an amount that depends on the surface diffusion coefficient .",
    "a path of a diffusing particle starting at point `` x '' and leaving the sphere through the escape window placed on the south pole . excursions in the inner part of the sphere between two consecutive contacts with the surface ( brownian excursions ) are marked by a blue color while the excursions along the surface - by a green color.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    it would be even more realistic to suppose that in the presence of particle - surface attractive interactions , the search for the escape window will be an _",

    "[ cartoon1 ] , a typical particle trajectory will consist of a sequence of surface diffusion tours followed by excursions in the inner part of the domain , i.e. , an _ intermittent _ combination of diffusion in @xmath21 and @xmath22 spatial dimensions . in this case , @xmath0 will also acquire a dependence on the mean time @xmath23 of residence on the surface within each round of surface diffusion .",
    "given that attractive interactions are always present , the result in eq .",
    "[ net ] , based on the assumption of a perfectly reflecting wall , does not provide a reliable estimate of the actual mean narrow - escape time @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we study analytically , within a mean - field approach , the effect of the particle - surface affinity on the mean narrow - escape times . in section ii we define our model . in section iii",
    "we first rederive the result in eq .",
    "[ net ] in the spirit of the approach discussed by berg and purcell @xcite in their analysis of diffusive ligands adsorption from the extracellular space by cell bound receptors .",
    "next , we consider a special case of very strong attractive interactions , such that a particle , once it bumps on the surface , stays there for good and wanders along the surface until it finds the escape window .",
    "this limit can be thought off as an analogue of the adam - delbrck two - stage process .",
    "further on , we consider the general case of an intermittent two - stage process . we develop a mean - field approach which allows us to derive a general result for @xmath0 , valid for any @xmath23 .",
    "this result represents an interpolation formula from which we recover eq .",
    "[ net ] when @xmath24 and the result of the adam - delbrck - type approach for @xmath25 .",
    "finally , we conclude with a discussion of the overall effect of the particle - surface affinity on the net .",
    "we focus here on the simplest geometry in which the bounded domain is a sphere of radius @xmath12 .",
    "we base our approach on the analysis of representative particle s trajectories , rather than on the solution of the diffusion equation with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , instead of standard settings `` point particle vs window of radius @xmath1 '' , we switch here to an equivalent formulation in which the particle has radius @xmath1 , while the escape window is a point on the surface .",
    "consequently , we stipulate that the particle covers an area @xmath26 , when it touches the surface .",
    "we suppose , as well , that the particle is initially placed at a random position on the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath27 , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a numerical factor of order of unity ; its precise value will be discussed below .",
    "diffusion coefficient of the particle in the bulk inside the sphere is @xmath10 .",
    "when the particle approaches the sphere ( i.e. , the distance between the particle and the surface of the sphere gets smaller than @xmath30 ) , it becomes weakly adsorbed and starts to diffuse , with diffusion coefficient @xmath31 , along the surface of the sphere .",
    "at every ( arbitrary small ) time step @xmath32 , the particle updates its state : with probability @xmath33 it may detach from the surface and diffuse away , and with probability @xmath34 it stays adsorbed and continues diffusion over the surface . the time @xmath20 of residence on the surface within a single surface diffusion tour is a random variable with distribution @xmath35 where the mean value @xmath36 our goal is to define , in this general case , the decay of the probability @xmath3 that the particle has not found the escape window up to time @xmath4 , from which we will define the tail of the first - passage distribution @xmath2 and hence , the characteristic mean narrow - escape time @xmath0 , as a function of @xmath23 , @xmath10 , @xmath31 , @xmath12 and @xmath1 .",
    "as the first step , we rederive the results in eqs .",
    "[ classic][net ] , adapting to the net problem the approach discussed by berg and purcell @xcite within the context of chemoreception .",
    "next , we will extend the developed approach over the case when a particle has an affinity to the surface and may diffuse along the surface .",
    "let @xmath37 so that the boundary of the sphere is perfectly reflecting .",
    "a given path of a particle during time @xmath4 can be then viewed as a sequence of @xmath38 brownian excursions - 3d loops connecting the points where the particle has touched the surface ; of course , @xmath38 is a realization - dependent random variable .",
    "these excursions correspond to the parts of the path marked in blue in fig .",
    "[ cartoon1 ] ; since we focus on the case @xmath37 , the `` green '' parts should shrink to single points on the sphere .",
    "note that the term `` touching the surface '' , as well as the hypothetical path depicted in fig .",
    "[ cartoon1 ] should be viewed with an appropriate caution . as a matter of fact",
    ", the total number of distinct encounters of a point particle with the surface during a finite time interval is infinite in the limit of continuous diffusion . to avoid this confusing behavior",
    ", one has to introduce a finite cut - off distance of order of a realistic particle radius .    further on , not all encounters with the surface",
    "can be considered as independent tries in search for the escape window , but only those brownian excursions whose ends on the surface are separated by a distance greater than @xmath1 ; shorter brownian excursions should be removed and _ considered as _ a single try .",
    "this circumstance has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "of course , this criterion is rather ambiguous and does not define the precise value of the cut - off distance . in this regard ,",
    "we define a brownian excursion as a part of a particle trajectory which starts at a distance @xmath28 away from the surface and ends up on the surface without ever crossing it . in doing so",
    ", we consider @xmath29 as a fitting parameter which will be chosen afterwards in order to match the exact result in eq .",
    "[ net ] .",
    "the probability of not hitting the escape window in a single random encounter with the surface is @xmath39 .",
    "if the contacts with the surface can be taken as independent tries , we may estimate the probability that a given path , starting at a random location on the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath40 , has not found the escape window as a product @xmath41 .",
    "consequently , the survival probability @xmath3 will be given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the probability that the particle `` touched '' the surface exactly @xmath38 times within time interval @xmath4 .",
    "suppose now that a particle starting at @xmath44 at distance @xmath45 apart of the surface of the sphere touches the surface for the first time at @xmath46 , for the second time at @xmath47 , and etc .",
    "then , the probability distribution @xmath43 can be defined as @xmath48 where the symbol @xmath49 denotes averaging with respect to the distribution of @xmath50-variables , while @xmath51 is the heaviside theta - function which is defined as @xmath52 if @xmath53 and zero otherwise .    using the following representation of the rectangular function : @xmath54 @xmath55 being the inverse laplace transformation with respect to the parameter @xmath56",
    ", we perform averaging over the distribution @xmath57 of independent , identically distributed @xmath50-variables and find that @xmath43 obeys @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the moment - generating function of the @xmath50-variables .",
    "one may readily notice that @xmath43 in eq .",
    "[ pp ] is normalized , @xmath60 .    to evaluate @xmath61 , and",
    "hence , @xmath62 , consider the following auxiliary problem - the survival of a particle , ( whose initial location is uniformly distributed on the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath40 ) , which diffuses with diffusion coefficient @xmath10 within a sphere of radius @xmath12 whose surface is perfectly adsorbing .",
    "the green s function @xmath63 solution of this problem is given by @xcite : @xmath64 integrating over the angular variables and @xmath65 we find @xmath66 - the probability that such a particle survives until time @xmath50 , from which we get the desired probability density function @xmath67 that the first encounter with the surface occurred exactly at time moment @xmath50 : @xmath68 note that the distribution in eq .",
    "[ dist ] has been previously obtained in @xcite within a different context .    before we proceed further , several remarks concerning the pdf in eq .",
    "[ dist ] are to be made .",
    "the distribution @xmath61 involves three different time scales .",
    "the smallest one corresponds to the most probable value @xmath69 , which means that most of the time the particle simply bounces onto the surface almost immediately without leaving it for any considerable distance .",
    "further on , at intermediate scales the distribution @xmath61 has a `` fat '' algebraic tail @xmath70 . in this regime @xmath61 describes the probability for a random walk , commencing at a plane bounding an infinite @xmath71 system , to return back to the plane for the first time after @xmath50 steps . as a matter of fact , the mean @xmath50 - the mean length of brownian excursions @xmath72 -",
    "is dominated by this very regime : @xmath73 and is @xmath74 times larger than the most probable return time .",
    "finally , at times of order @xmath75 , finite - size effects dominate and the distribution @xmath61 decays exponentially with time .    consequently , the moment - generating function of a random variable @xmath50 obeys @xmath76 from which equation we find that at sufficiently large times @xmath4 , the distribution function @xmath43 follows : @xmath77 this distribution is centered around the mean value @xmath78 and , at fixed @xmath4 , decays exponentially with @xmath38 on both sides of the @xmath79 .",
    "now , the asymptotic decay form of @xmath3 in eq .  [ s ] can be determined in two different ways .",
    "we can either convert the sum into an integral and use the asymptotic distribution in eq .",
    "[ dist2 ] , or perform summation exactly and then invert the laplace transform in the asymptotic limit @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "we proceed with the latter scenario . plugging @xmath82 given by eq .",
    "[ pp ] into eq .",
    "[ s ] and performing summation over @xmath38 , we get @xmath83 in the large-@xmath4 limit , the integral in eq .",
    "[ ss ] is dominated by the behavior of @xmath62 in the vicinity of @xmath84 .",
    "expanding @xmath85 we find that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath3 in eq.[ss ] follows @xmath86 choosing now @xmath87 , we see that the latter decay form coincides with the result in eqs.[classic][net ] .",
    "consequently , we may interpret @xmath7 in eq .",
    "[ net ] as @xmath88 where the first multiplier determines the mean number of independent tries necessary to find the location of the escape window , while the second factor is the mean time separating independent tries - the mean length of a brownian excursion .      in this subsection",
    "we consider an opposite extreme case , i.e. that of @xmath89 , so that once a particle happens to approach the surface of the domain , it stays there for good and wanders along the surface until it finds the escape window . in a sense , this is an idealized situation . indeed , in this case the barrier against the desorption should be infinitely large , and consequently , the barrier against the lateral diffusion should be infinitely large too , effectively suppressing the movement of the particle along the surface .    neglecting the time @xmath72",
    "it will take , on average , for the particle to arrive for the first time at some random point on the surface of the domain , we write the probability that a particle diffusing along the surface with diffusion coefficient @xmath31 wo nt find the escape window until time @xmath4 as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the mean area swept on the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath12 by a diffusive disc of radius @xmath1 until time @xmath4 - a two - dimensional analog a wiener sausage .",
    "this area is defined by a series @xcite @xmath92,\\ ] ] where @xmath93 @xmath94 being the legendre functions , while @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the roots ( numbered in the ascending order ) of the equation @xmath97 note that the expansion in eq .",
    "[ exp ] differs by a factor @xmath98 from the formal solution of the trapping problem on the surface of a sphere @xcite .",
    "this difference originates from different initial conditions .",
    "namely , in our case a particle can be initially located at any point on the surface ( including the area covered by the trap , in which case it disappears instantaneously , - this corresponds to finding the escape window at a first try ) , while in the situation studied in @xcite the particle starts from a random point somewhere outside the trap .    the leading asymptotic behavior of @xmath3 in eq .",
    "[ 5 ] is dominated by the smallest root @xmath99 of eq .",
    "[ roots ] .",
    "hence , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath3 is @xmath100 with @xmath101 where the subscript `` 2d '' signifies that the search for the escape window proceeds in this case via the surface diffusion .",
    "when @xmath14 , for the smallest root one gets @xmath102 and , consequently , @xmath103 obeys , in the leading order in @xmath11@xcite : @xmath104 this result has been also obtained in @xcite and @xcite , and earlier by bloomfield and prager @xcite in their calculation of the attachment rate of tail fibers to bacteriophages .",
    "note that @xmath105 and thus should be much larger than @xmath106 , which describes the mean time necessary to reach the surface of the domain .",
    "this means that it was quite legitimate to discard this contribution in our analysis .",
    "we turn finally to the general case when the detachment probability @xmath107 , so that a particle , when touching the surface , will remain weakly adsorbed and wander on the surface for some random time @xmath20 , then detach and diffuse in the bulk , re - attach to the surface , and etc .",
    "consider a path starting at a random point on the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath108 and suppose that this path touched the surface of the sphere at time moment @xmath109 , then wandered along the surface for a random time @xmath110 , detached from the surface at time moment @xmath111 , subsequently returned to the surface at time moment @xmath112 , etc .",
    "then , assuming that subsequent visits of the surface can be considered as independent tries in search for the exit , the probability @xmath3 that the escape window has not been found by such a path comprising @xmath38 rounds of brownian excursions followed by subsequent surface diffusion tours , can be written as    @xmath113    where now the symbol @xmath114 denotes now the averaging with respect to both the distribution of @xmath50-variables , eq .",
    "[ dist ] , and the distribution of @xmath20-variables , eq .",
    "[ ps ] .",
    "note that eq.[sss ] tacitly assumes that each surface diffusion tour is an independent try in search for the escape window , which manifests itself in the decoupling of the average of the product into the product of average values .",
    "this is , of course , an uncontrollable assumption .",
    "on one hand , the distribution @xmath115 of the distance @xmath116 between the point where the particle detaches from the surface and the point where it re - attaches to the surface again after an excursion in the bulk is given by the poisson kernel for a three - dimensional ball , @xcite : @xmath117 .",
    "this is a broad distribution , such that the areas visited on the surface in two consecutive surface diffusion tours will not , on average , significantly overlap .    on the other hand ,",
    "the surface of the domain is of a finite extent and one will certainly have an oversampling - some parts of the surface will be visited many times before the escape window is found .",
    "this will incur some correlations in the search process , since the true survival probability @xmath3 accounts only for the actual area swept on the surface by a particle up to time @xmath4 , and counts multiple visits to the same place as a single try .",
    "in this sense , eq . [ sss ] defines a lower bound on the true survival probability , precisely in the same way as the rosenstock ( or smoluchowski ) approximation defines a rigorous lower bound on the decay function for the trapping problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , decoupling of correlations defines a rigorous lower bound on the mean narrow - escape time .",
    "given that , as we proceed to show , @xmath0 obtained via such a mean - field approach entails exact results for @xmath118 and @xmath25 , one may judge that it is a useful and plausible approximation .",
    "a further discussion of this matter goes beyond the scope of the current paper and will be addressed both analytically and numerically elsewhere @xcite .    using the laplace transform representation of the rectangular function , eq .  [ rect ]",
    ", we may conveniently rewrite eq .",
    "[ sss ] and perform straightforwardly averaging over the distributions of @xmath50 and @xmath20-variables . in doing so , we get @xmath119 where @xmath120 explicitly , @xmath121 is given by a series @xmath122 consider now the behavior of the coefficients in this series in more detail . first , for small @xmath11 a good approximate solution of eq .",

    "inverting eq .  [ 5s ]",
    ", we obtain our main results : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the mean net for diffusion in a sphere with particle - surface affinity .",
