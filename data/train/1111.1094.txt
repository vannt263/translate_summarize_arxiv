    "current research on the fields of living technologies , artificial systems and embodied evolution is highly multidisciplinary and is related to many different bio - chemical , micro - technological and robotic areas .    *",
    "( a ) * collective systems  @xcite are one of the major research fields devoted to common principal and mechanisms underlying mechatronic and non - mechatronic embodiment of living systems : different collective effects , scalability , self - organization , self - assembling as well as development of common evaluation tests and benchmarks .",
    "essential attention is paid to individual and collective cognition  @xcite , exploring bio - inspired principles , collective homeostatic regulation  @xcite as well as different applications in manufacturing  @xcite .",
    "it is also related to analytical approaches  @xcite , for example collective decision making  @xcite , which target guided self - assembling and self - organization in real systems .",
    "many works cover the notion of embodied evolution  @xcite and development of multi - cellular artificial structures , their self - development , adaptation , reliability and other aspects  @xcite .    *",
    "( b ) * bio - hybrid technologies represent a large field of research , which also approaches artificial living systems .",
    "one of the methods here is the combination of cultured ( living ) neurons and robots @xcite to investigate the dynamical and adaptive properties of neural systems @xcite .",
    "this work is also related to understanding of how information is encoded  @xcite and processed within a living neural network @xcite .",
    "the hybrid technology can be used for neuro - robotic interfaces , different applications of _ in vitro _",
    "neural networks  @xcite or for bidirectional interaction between the brain and the external environment in both collective and non - collective systems .",
    "several research projects already addressed the problem of controlling autonomous robots by living neurons  @xcite .",
    "promising research area in bio - hybrid systems is the synthetic biology and the integration of real bio - chemical and microbiological systems into technological developments ; for example using bacterial cellular mechanisms as sensors , development of bacterial bio - hybrid materials  @xcite , molecular synthesis of polymers and biofuels , genome engineering , and more general fields and challenges of synthetic biology  @xcite .    *",
    "( c ) * chemo - hybrid systems are another field of research , which targets bottom - up approach towards artificial living systems .",
    "it is inspired by artificial chemistry  @xcite , self - replicating systems  @xcite , using bio - chemical mechanisms for e.g. cognition  @xcite as well as by a general field of material science .",
    "in several works , this approach is denoted as swarm chemistry  @xcite .",
    "researchers hope that such systems will give answers to questions related to developmental models  @xcite , chemical computation , self - assembly , self - replication , simple chemistry - based ecologies  @xcite or technological capabilities of creating large - scale functional patterns @xcite .",
    "currently , three possible scenarios for living technologies and embodied evolution can be distinguished .",
    "firstly , further development of micro- and nano- mechatronics can make it possible to achieve an advanced functionality at bottom layers ( such as self - replication ) .",
    "this involves several different technologies from material science ; we can denote this scenario as _ nano - mechatronic scenario_. secondly , the complexity of upper levels ( such as information processing ) can be handled by bio - technologies through advancements in minimal cell projects and cellular programmability , so that we can expect an appearance of pure _ bio - synthetic systems_. finally , both approaches can be merged so that to make use of their advantages .",
    "this approach is termed _ bio - hybrid scenario _ , which combines bio - chemical and mechatronic autonomous systems .",
    "* challenge i : * three above mentioned scenarios mean a further development of micro- and nano- mechatronics , the growth of bio- and chemo- synthetic systems , the hybridization of robotics , and appearance of  soft / wet \" systems .",
    "each of these developments has own challenges , promises and risks .",
    "however , independent of what the dominant future technology might be , we face a new problem of integration of methodologies , paradigms and approaches from different areas of biology , chemistry , material science and robotics . this new integration will require re - structuring current research landscape , which will not only essentially change the way we think about synthetic systems , but also extend their scientific and technological boundaries .",
    "material sciences , bottom up chemistry and genetic engineering are especially relevant for open - ended embodied evolution and unbounded self - development  which are essential challenges for artificial living systems .",
    "* challenge ii : * the _ hybrid scenario _ can be considered as the most probable way for future autonomous systems . here",
    "we can identify several open research questions , the most important from them : _ how the current ict can be combined with bio - chemical developments ? _ this question is also known in other formulations , e.g. `` _ _ programmability of bio - synthetic systems _ _ '' , and is the key point in a series of other scientific and technological challenges , and to some extent , even in understanding principles of synthetic life .",
    "many research initiatives addressed it ; this represents a key aspect of the long - term research agenda .",
    "* challenge iii : * artificial living systems possess a potentially high degree of plasticity and can undergo a developmental drift .",
    "there are many reasons for this : long - term developmental independence and autonomous behavior , emergence of artificial sociality , mechanisms of evolutionary self - organization . such systems are very flexible and adaptive , but they also massively increase their own degrees of freedom . new challenges in this area are related to a long - term controllability and predictability of `` self- * '' , principles of making plastic purposeful systems , predictability of structural development and engineering of open - ended evolution .",
    "these challenges have a great impact on the human community in general ( cf . the `` terminator '' scenario ) as well as in different areas of embodied evolution and living technologies .    from the viewpoint of a short - term and middle - term research agenda",
    ", it would make sense to undertake a step - wise transition from current mechatronic towards hybrid collective systems : below are some examples of open research questions :                  _ - do artificial homeostasis and energetic survival lead to appearance of cognitive capabilities and to emergence of different self - phenomena ( denoted as `` self- * '' ) : self - replication , self - development , self - recovering ? _",
    "this position paper points to the important requirement to hybrid technologies  integration of different research fields  which will be a vital challenge in coming years .",
    "this can be done only in large interdisciplinary teams , e.g. within large european projects .",
    "creating such teams as well as a necessary equipment in addressing fundamentals of different synthetic systems belongs to essential points of the long - term research agenda ."
