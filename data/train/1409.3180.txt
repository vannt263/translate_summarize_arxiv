    "among the high energy theories proposed in the last years , the braneworld models gained prominence due their fundamental basis on string - theory and since they grant an explanation for the gauge hierarchy and the cosmological constant problems @xcite .",
    "once kaluza - klein ( kk ) models @xcite launched the possibility of extra dimensions , it has been blossomed models where the four - dimensional observable space - time is regarded as a membrane embedded in a higher - dimensional space - time @xcite .",
    "the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model enhanced this hypothesis by assuming an infinite extra dimension whose warped geometry yields to a compact transverse space @xcite . in the sequel",
    ", some models appeared proposing the brane be generated by a topological defect . in five dimensions , domain walls have been used to represent the brane @xcite , whilst in six dimensions , with axial symmetry the geometry resemblances that of the cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "the resulting scenario is the so - called string - like braneworld @xcite .",
    "systems composed by complex scalar field ( global ) and gauge field ( local ) often describe string - like objects , such as the vortices and the cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the domain walls , there is no complete ( interior and exterior ) string - like solution analytically known , even in flat space - time .",
    "in warped braneworlds , cohen - kaplan @xcite , gregory @xcite and olaganesi - vilenkin @xcite studied the exterior solution of a global string - like brane with and without bulk cosmological constant .",
    "the local case was addressed numerically by giovaninni _ et al _ which acquired a smooth geometry satisfying the dominant energy condition @xcite .",
    "apart from the particular model used to compose the brane core , the exterior warped string - like solution with cosmological constant has a conformally - flat behavior that extends the five - dimensional randall - sundrum model @xcite . in the infinitely thin core brane limit",
    ", the resulting model is called the gherghetta - shaposhnikov ( gs ) model @xcite .",
    "the gs model provides a correction to the newtonian potential due to the kk modes less than in the rs model @xcite .",
    "another advantage over the rs model is that the kaluza - klein massless mode of the gauge field is naturally localized on the string - brane without any further coupling @xcite . the fermionic field , in its turn ,",
    "can be trapped in the gs brane through a gauge minimal coupling only @xcite .    besides the interesting features for the fields",
    ", the string - like braneworlds also exhibit a rich geometric structure .",
    "in fact , the two extra dimensions form a transverse manifold with its internal symmetries and properties that reflect on the brane tension and geometry @xcite .",
    "the transverse manifold used in the gs model is a disc whereas kehagias proposed a conical space to provide an explanation for the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "garriga - porrati studied the effects generated by a football - shaped manifold @xcite and gogberashvili _ et al _ addressed the fermion generations problem by means of an apple - shaped space @xcite . in a supersymmetry setup ,",
    "de carlos and moreno found a gravity trapping solution without cosmological constant and that asymptotically has a constant transverse radius , named as a cigar - like universe @xcite .    in a recent work published by two of the present authors",
    "@xcite , the so - called cigar soliton is used to construct an interesting smooth interior and exterior string - like geometry referred as the string - cigar .",
    "the cigar soliton is a two - dimensional self - similar solution of the ricci flow , a geometric flux driven by the ricci tensor @xcite .",
    "there are important applications of the ricci flow in differents branches of physics as in the sigma models @xcite , euclidean black holes @xcite , topological massive gravity @xcite , adm mass @xcite and in the heisenberg model in statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the ricci flow defines a family of geometries developing under an evolution parameter @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the string - cigar scenario proves the changes of the brane properties due to the geometric flow @xcite .",
    "since the ricci soliton extends the einstein manifolds , the string - cigar geometry can be realised as an augmented codimension two model proposed by randjbar - daemi and shaposhnikov whose transverse space is a ricci flat manifold @xcite .",
    "another smoothed thick string - like model which leads to a geometrical flow in the transverse space was built with a section of the resolved conifold ; an important orbifold in string theory @xcite .",
    "both models yield to regular geometries that asymptotically recover the gs model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the string - cigar model satisfies all the regularity conditions required to ensure a well - behaved 3-brane at the origin whereas the resolution parameter plays the role of the radius of the fifth dimension what violates the conical behavior near the origin @xcite .",
    "the string - cigar scenario enables the existence of a localized gravitational massless - mode which effectively describes the gravity on the brane @xcite .",
    "the massless ( or zero ) mode in this scenario has the same asymptotically exponential behavior of that in the gs model , but near the origin it is smooth and has a bell - shape .",
    "hence , the string - cigar scenario smoothes the geometry and the zero - mode near the origin .",
    "as the geometry undergoes the ricci flow in the transverse space , the massless mode changes its width and amplitude @xcite . in this work",
    ", we find a new massless mode for the gs and the string - cigar models by the schrdinger approach which exhibits a more localized behavior .",
    "another noteworthy feature of the string - cigar model is its inhomogeneous source @xcite .",
    "indeed , the maximum of the stress - energy tensor components is displaced from the origin what suggests the brane core is shifted @xcite .",
    "et al _ found a similar behavior for an abelian vortex with higher winding number @xcite .",
    "the gravitational massless mode shares the same profile , and it shows the influence of the geometric changes on the physics of the brane @xcite .",
    "moreover , as pointed out by tinyakov and zuleta , the source for the gs model does not satisfy the dominant energy condition @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the string - cigar source undergoes a phase transition whereupon some configurations fulfill all the energy conditions @xcite .",
    "further , as higher the bulk cosmological constant closer to the gs model is the string - cigar source .",
    "nonetheless , the complexity of the differential equation for the kk modes turns the numerical analysis the most subtle approach to obtain the whole spectrum of masses and eigenfunctions @xcite .",
    "thus , the foremost purpose of this work is to attain the massive kk spectrum and to analyse how it behaves upon the ricci flow that the cigar undergoes .",
    "although gherghetta and shaposhnikov have found a complete set of eigenfunctions for their thin - string model , the corresponding kk masses expression for the discrete states is valid only for large values of a discretization index @xmath1 @xcite . in this limit ,",
    "the masses increase linearly but for small @xmath1 the behavior is yet unknown .",
    "then , our numerical analysis provides the full kk mass spectrum of the gs and string - cigar scenarios .",
    "both models show a decreasing behavior for small @xmath1 with a mass gap between the two patterns",
    ". moreover , the gs model presents a massive mode with tiny mass and amplitude which is absent in the string - cigar model .",
    "the parallel between the two models provides more information of how the fields behave on singular and smooth scenarios in six dimensions .",
    "et al _ have numerically studied the interior and exterior geometry of a string - like braneworld , but have not concerned with the kk spectrum @xcite . in this article ,",
    "numerical methods are also used to find and to study gravitational resonant massive modes on both gs and string - cigar models . even though the analogous",
    "schredinger potential exhibits an infinite potential well around the origin for the string - cigar model , resonant modes are allowed in contrast with the gs model where they are absent .",
    "it turns out that the resonant modes appear only for small masses .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the section [ review ] the main characteristics and results of the gs and string - cigar models are reviewed .",
    "next , in section [ numericalresults-1 ] , the numerical results which concern to the spectrum and eigenfunction are presented . in section [ numericalresults-2 ] , the study of kk massive modes as resonant states is developed . finally , in the section [ conclusions ] ,",

    "massive particles confined on the well may be interpreted as gravitational resonant states ( massive quasi - localized gravitons highly coupled to the brane ) @xcite .",

    "the relative probability function ( [ probabilidaderelativa ] ) is more suitable to detect very narrow resonances if they exist @xcite .",
    "according to the energy - density given in eq .",
    "( [ densidadeenergia ] ) the brane distribution is @xmath160 = [ 0.01 , 0.50]$ ] .",
    "the domain is chosen to be @xmath161 = [ 0.01 , 5.0]$ ] ( @xmath162 times the integration range ) , for which the plane wave probability would be @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "the position of the resonance peak , where the physical information is stored , does not depend on @xmath155 , since it is chosen sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "[ fig - ressonancia ] presents the numerical solution of the relative probability @xmath151 .",
    "the first ( and largest ) peak is revealed for @xmath164 .",
    "the resonant peaks ( there is only one for each @xmath0 ) decrease and become broader with @xmath0 .",
    "this means that the resonant massive states lifetime ( estimated as @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the width at half maximum of the peak @xcite ) decreases with the cosmological constant .",
    "[ fig - funcao - onda ] exhibits the solutions of the schrdinger equation for the masses indicated with the probability peaks .",
    "the first solution shows that this particular massive graviton has the highest probability to be found on the brane .",

    "[ fig - densidadeenergia ] ) , enhance the width of the resonance . therefore , as @xmath167",
    ", the resonant states acquire shorter lifetimes reducing the possibility to massive gravitons result in any physical measurement .",
    "this result agrees with the fact that for @xmath168 the potential barrier tends to the @xmath169 , where no massive state is allowed .",
    "this work displays a study of the gravitational kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes in the gherghetta - shaposhnikov ( gs ) and the string - cigar braneworlds . by the analysis of the energy density ,",
    "the former can be realised as a thin string - like model whereas the last is regarded as interior and exterior smoothed gs model .",
    "we obtain a new massless mode for the gs model by analysing the radial equation in the schrdinger approach .",
    "it turns out that this massless mode has a bigger amplitude and rate of decay compared with that of the gs model .",
    "further , the transition between the massive and massless modes is not smooth what yields to a mass gap .",
    "we obtained via numerical analysis a complete spectrum of masses and eigenfunctions for both models . besides the mass gap between the massless mode and the massive modes , both models present a gap separating two regimes . for large values of the discrete index @xmath1",
    ", the spectrum behaves linearly , as predicted by gs model .",
    "however , for small @xmath1 , the masses decrease as @xmath170 .",
    "this result can be explained by the feature of the zeros of the bessel function of the first kind in the two regimes .",
    "asymptotically , the string - cigar eigenfunctions are similar to gs ones whereas near the brane they behave as the bessel function of the first kind .",
    "it turns out that the amplitude of the modes is bigger in the string - cigar model than in the gs model .",
    "hence , the brane source enhances the modes near the core .    in the gs model , the eigenfunction with a lowest mass resemblances the massless mode with an almost vanishing amplitude",
    ", it was referred as transient mode .",
    "this transient mode is absent in the string - cigar model what can be regarded as an improvement since the light mode should already have been detected .",
    "then , the resolution of the gs model get rides this transient mode .    the string - cigar model , unlike the gs model , allows the existence of resonant states .",
    "indeed , the conical behavior near the origin yields to a potential well not presented in the gs model .",
    "resonance peaks were found ( where the highest one occurs when @xmath164 and @xmath171 ) which decrease becoming broader with @xmath0 , meaning that the resonant massive states lifetime decreases with the cosmological constant .",
    "the solution for the mass eigenvalue indicated with the highest resonance peak shows that this particular massive graviton has a high probability to be found on the brane .",
    "the results obtained points as perspectives the effects of the gravitational kk modes in a modification of the newtonian potential .",
    "in fact , the higher amplitude of the eigenfunctions at the brane core and the new decreasing behavior of the spectrum may lead to interesting modifications in the gravitational potential .",
