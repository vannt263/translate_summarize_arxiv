    "however , there is a possibility that the bao scale at the decoupling time is inhomogeneous , if the ratio between the energy densities of baryonic matter and cdm has been inhomogeneous at the decoupling time .",
    "if the ratio between the energy densities of baryonic matter and cdm is inhomogeneous and isotropic , we can not distinguish the inhomogeneous isotropic universe model from the flrw universe model by only the distance - redshift relation , the fluctuation spectrum of the cmbr and the bao scale . in the case of @xmath189 and @xmath190",
    ", the inhomogeneous isotropic universe model can also explain observations , if the fluctuation of the ratio between the energy densities of baryonic matter and cdm at @xmath10 is @xmath201 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "it is very important to observe the ratio between the energy densities of baryonic matter and cdm in the domain @xmath135 .",

    "here , we discuss whether the inhomogeneous isotropic universe model can satisfy the all of the conditions ( [ da - con])([dz - con ] ) , if the ratio between the energy densities of baryonic matter and cdm depends on @xmath34 .",
    "we assume that the comoving length scale of fluctuation of ratio between the energy densities of baryonic matter and cdm is the order of that of the present horizon and the energy density of radiation @xmath202 does not depend on @xmath34 .",
    "the energy densities of non - relativistic matter @xmath203 and baryonic matter @xmath204 are write in the form , @xmath205 @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the density contrast of baryonic matter . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath208 where @xmath209 is arbitrary constant",
    ".    the condition ( [ da - con ] ) does not impose any constraints on the ratio between the energy densities of baryonic matter and cdm . by the assumption ,",
    "the ratio between the energy densities of baryonic matter and cdm is almost spatially constant in the vicinity of the lss , so that the condition ( [ cl - con ] ) fixes @xmath210 and @xmath175 in the same way as in the case that the ratio between the energy densities of baryonic matter and cdm does not fluctuate .",
    "by contrast , the fluctuation of the ratio between the energy densities of baryonic matter and cdm affects the sound velocity of baryonic matter , hence @xmath101 may depend on @xmath34 .",
    "since we consider the inhomogeneous isotropic universe model whose comoving length scale of inhomogeneities is comparable to that of the present horizon , @xmath211 can be obtained by regarding our inhomogeneous isotropic universe model as a homogenous isotropic universe model in each domain of bao scale at decoupling time .",
    "hence @xmath101 at each @xmath34 is approximately determined by the fitting formulae given in ref .",
    "@xcite , since we have assumed that @xmath212 at the decoupling time is equal to the value at the lss .    here",
    "note that @xmath209 is a free parameter .",
    "we may choose @xmath209 so that the inhomogeneous isotropic universe model satisfies the conditions ( [ da - con])([dz - con ] ) .",
    "for example , in the case of the flrw universe model with @xmath189 and @xmath199 , the inhomogeneous isotropic universe model satisfies the conditions ( [ da - con])([dz - con ] ) , if we assume @xmath213 .",
