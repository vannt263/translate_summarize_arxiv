    "conventional magnets in condensed matter typically develop long - range magnetic order when cooled to low temperatures @xcite . below their ordering temperature the magnetic moments develop a static component which acts as the order parameter for the phase transition and the spin ordering is observable as magnetic bragg peaks which characterize the type of order .",
    "the excitations are usually spin - waves which are collective oscillations of the spins about their ordering directions . the transition can be described by landau theory where symmetry is broken and the new phase is characterized by a local order parameter @xcite .",
    "it was recently realized that some states of matter are characterized by topological order , rather than by symmetry breaking and a local order parameter @xcite .",
    "this important discovery promises new , exotic and potentially useful properties that could be of relevance e.g. to information technologies .",
    "for example topological order gives rise to coherent states which can be highly robust to the usual perturbations that destroy coherence in ordinary states due to the non - local nature of their correlations .",
    "one potential application is to provide stable qubits in a topological quantum computer @xcite .    in magnetism topological order",
    "is found in the spin liquid state @xcite .",
    "this state is characterized by the absence of static long - range magnetic order or spin freezing .",
    "instead the spins remain dynamic , highly entangled and in coherent motion down to the lowest temperatures @xcite .",
    "the excitations of a spin liquid are spinons which are particles with fractional quantum numbers that can not be created individually but must be produced in numbers greater than one .",
    "spinons are well - understood in one - dimensional ( 1d ) antiferromagnets @xcite where they have a spin quantum number of @xmath4 which makes them individually inaccessible to condensed matter probes such as neutron or raman scattering whose selection rules ensure that the spin quantum number changes by an integer amount . as a result spinons have to be created in multiple pairs and are observed as a continuum of excitations in complete contrast to the single spin - wave excitations observed in conventional magnets by inelastic neutron scattering as a sharp mode with a well - defined trajectory throughout energy and wavevector space @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient for spin liquid behavior is competition which leads to many quasi - degenerate ground states so the system is unable to choose a single configuration but oscillates between the different possibilities .",
    "competition can be achieved when the interactions between the magnetic ions are incompatible with each other and/or with anisotropies present in the system . while these ideas are being explored theoretically using model hamiltonians , real spin liquid materials are very rare because even small additional terms in the hamiltonian lift the degeneracy allowing the system to revert to static long - range magnetic order and spin - wave excitations .",
    "the most famous example of a spin liquid that arises from competition between interactions and anisotropies is spin ice as realized in ho@xmath5ti@xmath5o@xmath1 and dy@xmath5ti@xmath5o@xmath1 where the magnetic ions form a pyrochlore lattice of corner - sharing tetrahedra @xcite . here",
    "ferromagnetic interactions which favor parallel spin alignment compete with local anisotropies that favor a non - collinear arrangement .",
    "the resulting ground state has no static magnetic order although it has a topological 2-in-2-out order on each tetrahedron .",
    "the excitations are free monopoles which can be regarded as fractionalized magnetic dipoles .",
    "another example is the kitaev spin liquid where the magnetic ions form a honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "the highly directional ising interactions couple just one spin component . for each interaction that a spin makes with its three nearest neighbors a different component is favored leading to the competition that gives rise to the spin liquid ground state and majorana fermion excitations .",
    "real kiteav spin liquid candidates such as rucl@xmath6 and na@xmath5iro@xmath7 contain additional terms in their hamiltonians including isotropic ( heisenberg ) interactions and higher neighbor interactions which induce static magnetic order in the ground state @xcite .",
    "nevertheless signatures of majorana fermion excitations are visible at high energies above the ordering temperature @xcite .",
    "spin liquids based on heisenberg interactions with no anisotropy rely entirely on competition between the interactions to generate frustration .",
    "it is usually assumed that predominantly antiferromagnetic interactions are necessary .",
    "this is because spins coupled by ferromagnetic heisenberg interactions can rotate and align parallel to each other on any lattice , satisfying all the bonds simultaneously and giving rise to ferromagnetic long - range order .",
    "specific lattices are required that allow geometrical frustration such as those consisting of triangular units . here",
    "antiferromagnetic coupling favors antiparallel spin alignment between nearest - neighbor spins , which can never be satisfied on all magnetic bonds .",
    "this typically leads to highly degenerate ground states and the tendency for static long - range order is reduced .",
    "this tendency can be further suppressed in quantum systems where the magnetic ions have quantum spin number @xmath8 ; here the heisenberg uncertainty principle produces zero - point motion that is comparable to the size of the spin and which persists down to @xmath9  k @xcite .",
    "the most celebrated isotropic quantum spin liquid model is the kagome where @xmath8 magnetic ions on a two - dimensional lattice of corner sharing triangles interact via antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor interactions . among the proposed physical realizations of the kagome , the best candidate is herbertsmithite , which has recently been verified as a quantum spin liquid @xcite .",
    "herbertsmithite has no long - range order down to the lowest temperatures , and its excitations are spinons which are observed as a diffuse multi - spinon continuum in inelastic neutron scattering . @xmath8",
    "kagome magnets with higher neighbor interactions have also been explored . in particular kapellasite",
    "has a spin liquid ground state .",
    "it consists of ferromagnetic first neighbor interactions which compete with antiferromagnetic third neighbor interactions ( across the diagonal of the hexagon ) that are both isotropic and of approximately equal strength @xcite .",
    "this system can be viewed as a network of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic chains coupled together by frustrated interactions @xcite .",
    "recently the new quantum spin liquid compound ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2was discovered @xcite . using a combination of bulk properties measurements and muon",
    "spectroscopy it was shown that the ground state has no static long - range magnetic order or any static magnetism down to @xmath10  mk and that the spins are fluctuating at the lowest temperatures .",
    "the spin fluctuations slow down as temperature is reduced and become constant below @xmath11  k where ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2appears to enter a state of persistent spin dynamics .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering revealed broad diffuse features typical of a multi - spinon continuum rather than sharp spin - waves .",
    "further evidence for the spin liquid state was provided by pseudofermion functional renormalization group ( pffrg ) calculations which can compute the static susceptibility and determine whether a specific hamiltonian develops static long - range magnetic order .",
    "pffrg calculations using the hamiltonian of ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2clearly showed the absence of static magnetism and furthermore were able to reproduce the diffuse hexagonal ring - like scattering observed in the data as a function of wavevector .",
    "interestingly this spin liquid state was shown to be highly robust and to survive variations in the individual exchange parameters by up to 50% @xcite .        in ref .",
    "@xcite , the derivation of the hamiltonian of ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2was not given , and one of the goals of this paper is to report how the magnetic interactions were determined . in part 1 the magnetic hamiltonian is derived by measuring the excitations under an applied magnetic field strong enough to ensure a fully ordered ferromagnetic state . at this field",
    "the excitations transform into spin - waves and can be fitted by linear spin - wave theory to extract the exchange interactions .",
    "we show that the @xmath8 moments in ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2are coupled into a kagome bilayer structure by isotropic interactions . a complex combination of several ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions is found where surprisingly the ferromagnetic interactions are considerably stronger than the antiferromagnetic ones . in part 2 of the paper",
    "we explore the phase diagram of ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2using heat capacity and inelastic neutron scattering measurements for several applied magnetic fields up to the saturation field .",
    "the heat capacity reveals no phase transitions , but a number of crossovers are evident which are linked to changes in the magnetic excitations as they evolve from diffuse rings to sharp spin - waves . finally in the discussion section",
    "the phase diagram of ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2as a function of field and temperature showing the boundaries of the spin liquid phase is proposed .",
    "we also explain how the hamiltonian is able to support a quantum spin liquid ground state .",
    "the frustration arises from the direct ( vertex to vertex ) coupling of ferromagnetically coupled triangles to antiferromagnetically coupled triangles which prevents both triangles from achieving their ideal spin configuration .",
    "this frustration motif has not been considered before and points to new directions in the search for spin liquid behavior .",
    "we prepared powder and single crystal samples of ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2using the method described in ref .",

    "the crystal structure can be simplified into several two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnetic models .",
    "the consideration of purely 2d models is justified by the absence of magnetic dispersion along the @xmath24 axis as reveal below by the inelastic neutron scattering data .",
    "figure  [ fig : struct](b ) shows the arrangement of cr@xmath3 ions in a single layer .",

    "the cr@xmath3 ions form a kagome lattice in the @xmath22plane ( 2d structure of corner sharing triangles ) .",
    "the kagome layer is distorted because it consists two different equilateral triangles ( corresponding to two inequivalent interactions represented by the green and blue bonds ) which alternate .",

    "[ fig : bulk](a ) ) increases smoothly as temperature decreases and there is no indication of a magnetic phase transitions in this temperature range .",
    "the smooth increase is also inconsistent with a gap in the excitation spectrum which would be observed as a drop in susceptibility at lowest temperatures .",
    "a spin gap can occur due to magnetic anisotropy or because there is a dominant antiferromagnetic interaction which pairs the magnetic ions into spin singlets ( dimers ) leading to a non - magnetic ground state and gapped excitation .",
    "furthermore the magnetic interactions appear to be isotropic since the susceptibilities for @xmath25 and @xmath12 lie precisely on top of each other .",
    "the inverse susceptibility was fitted to the curie - weiss law in the temperature range 50 - 250  k. the effective moment per cr@xmath3ion is @xmath26 confirming that they have spin @xmath27 ( @xmath28 for @xmath8 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "the curie - weiss temperature is only @xmath30  k ( @xmath31  mev ) which indicates that the magnetic interactions are either extremely weak and/or that there is a mixture of ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interactions which partly cancel each other .",

    "the difference between the two datasets can be ascribed to the different measurement temperatures .",
    "no features indicating a field - induced transition are visible .",
    "the magnetization also does not suggest a significant spin gap which would suppress the magnetization below a critical field , however it should be noted that the temperature of the measurement was relatively high .",

    "fitting the region below 0.46  k to the heat capacity of a gapped dimer magnet ( see caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk ] ) yields a maximum possible gap of 0.09  mev .",

    "no difference is observed between these two field directions again suggesting isotropic , heisenberg interactions . at this field which is the field where the magnetization saturates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk](b ) ) , the broad maximum observed at @xmath353  k in zero field has disappeared and the heat capacity drops smoothly to 0 as t@xmath370  k. this is consistent with the saturated state where the spins are all parallel to the field and no magnetic entropy is left around the ground state .",
    "a broad maximum centered at 10.5  k remains which is caused by a schottky - like contribution due to the excitations that are gapped by the external field .",

    "a closer inspection of these two models reveals that despite their superficial differences they in fact have several striking similarities . both consist of triangles formed by strong ferromagnetic interactions ( @xmath49  -0.77 and @xmath49  -0.26 ) which are coupled directly ( vertex to vertex ) to triangles formed by weaker antiferromagnetic interactions ( @xmath49  0.10 and @xmath49  0.085 ) . in the case of the kagome bilayer model this direct coupling",

    "based on the crystal structure , the kagome bilayer model is much more physically reasonable than the coupled hexagons model .",

    "the two higher energy modes now lie at @xmath351.0  mev and @xmath351.5  mev respectively , all modes remain broad and lie on a diffuse scattering background which extends up to 1.7  mev . at @xmath76",
    "t the upper band has partly moved out of the measured energy range , while the lower two modes start to develop the characteristic features observed at @xmath79 and @xmath80  t such as the ` knot ' at ( 2,-2,0 ) . furthermore the diffuse scattering below the lowest energy mode",
    "is considerably reduced so that an energy gap of 0.6  mev is visible .",
    "even at this field the modes are much broader than the instrumental resolution showing that they can not be described as pure spin waves .",
    "the development of the magnetic excitations under external field can be compared to the field dependence of the heat capacity .",
    "the distinct weak peak in @xmath64 at @xmath65  t and @xmath11  k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] ) appears at the same field at which the lowest energy mode starts to emerge from the ground state , indicating a crossover from the zero field spin liquid into a different phase .",
    "in addition the emergence of the schottky - type broad peak can be linked to the opening of the energy gap in the excitation spectrum that is already partially formed at @xmath76  t. finally the broad peak that is observed from @xmath68 to @xmath83  t at @xmath69  k suggests the presence of low energy states below the energy gap at an energy of @xmath84  mev .",
    "while such states are not clearly evident in the magnetic excitations spectrum they may be masked by the strong incoherent scattering that extends up to 0.2 mev .",
    "alternatively these states may be invisible to neutron scattering e.g.  they might be singlet states .      in order to deepen our understanding of ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 , we compared it to a mean - field ground state and spin - wave excitations . a ground state with",
    "long - range magnetic order is of course not valid at these low fields and as already pointed out , the observed diffuse excitations can not be described as spin - waves which are well - defined at all energies and wavevectors .",
    "we therefore expect that these calculation can be used only as a guide to the approximate spin configuration and the general energy scale and intensity of the excitations . in order to find an effective ground state we used the following method : first the external magnetic field was added to the hamiltonian for the kagome bilayers model and the magnetic structure was optimized by minimizing its energy assuming a single ordering wavevector . at @xmath85  t",
    "this leads to a ferromagnetic structure with the spins entirely parallel to the external field .",
    "we then gradually decreased the field in the simulations and optimized the magnetic structure at each field step using the structure from the previous step as the starting point for the optimization .",
    "a step size of @xmath86  t was used for fields greater than @xmath87  t , while a step size of @xmath88  t was used at lower fields .    to make comparison to the magnetization data",
    ", we extracted the average spin projection long the external field direction of the mean - field magnetic structure as a function of field .",
    "this quantity is plotted over the magnetization data in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk ] .",
    "the calculation suggests a fully polarized phase for fields @xmath89 in contrast to the data which smoothly decreases below @xmath45  t. below @xmath65  t the calculated magnetization decreases steeply and linearly to zero .",
    "the measurement also shows a change of slope at @xmath65  t albeit a much more gradual one ( see also the second derivative @xmath17 for @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk](b ) ) and the data and simulation match each other at lowest fields .",
    "the clear discrepancies between the simulation and the data may be caused by the high measurement temperatures of @xmath13  k and @xmath90  k , in contrast the calculation was performed at @xmath91 k. the elevated temperatures would smooth sharp features in the magnetization as is already clear from a comparison of the data measured at @xmath13  k and @xmath90  k. magnetization measurements at dilution temperatures may provide better agreement between data and theory .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to see that the change of slope observed in both the data and the theory occurs at @xmath65  t where @xmath64 shows a peak and the inelastic neutron scattering data also reveal the formation of a mode at lowest energies , again suggesting that a crossover occurs at this field .",
    "spin - wave theory based on this mean - field ground state was used to calculate the excitations energies and neutron scattering cross - sections for ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2at various fields . in figure",
    "[ fig : osiris ] the spin - wave calculations are plotted alongside the data in the second and fourth rows .",
    "well - defined spin - wave modes are predicted for all fields in striking contrast to the diffuse features observed .",
    "it should be mentioned that to make comparison with the data the spin - waves were broadened by a gaussian with fwhm=0.25  mev , while the instrumental energy resolution is only 0.025 - 0.030 mev .",
    "thus significant quantum fluctuations must be still present at these intermediate fields which broaden the spectrum .",
    "nevertheless as the field is increased and the excitations in the data sharpen , the agreement between the spin - wave simulations and the measurement continuously improves .",
    "the energies and intensities of the simulated spin - waves actually correspond rather well to the energies where the scattering is strongest in the data and capture how the modes develop and shift upwards in energy with increasing field . in zero field",
    "the lowest energy mode is gapless in the simulation in general agreement with the rather intense scattering observed down to lowest energies in the data .",
    "this mode develops a dispersion at @xmath65  t in agreement with the data and becomes gapped for fields @xmath89  t. the clean gap predicted by the simulations is not observed in the data for fields up to @xmath82  t. at @xmath76  t the gap becomes cleaner while the excitations become clearer and in particular the ` knot ' observed at ( 2,-2,0 ) is nicely reproduced by the spin - wave simulation .",
    "as expected , the agreement between the spin - wave calculation and the data is worst in zero - field . instead of the two broad excitation bands observed in the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diffuse_scattering ] ) , three sharp dispersionless modes are predicted by spin - wave theory . while two of these modes are gapped at 0.48 and 1.2 mev , the third lies at elastic energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : osiris ] ) . in order to make a more detailed comparison to the data ,",
    "these spin - wave modes are artificially broadened by a fwhm of 0.4 mev .",
    "figure  [ fig : diffuse_scattering](e ) shows a constant energy slice through the spin - wave simulation at 0.25 mev in the ( @xmath92,@xmath93,0)-plane , which captures scattering from both the 0.48 mev and the elastic modes due to this broadening .",
    "comparison of this slice to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffuse_scattering](b ) shows that it is able to reproduce some of the ring - like features although of course these features are much sharper in the simulation .",
    "similar qualitative agreement is achieved by the spin - wave slice at 0.9 mev which captures the upper spin - wave mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diffuse_scattering](h ) ) and reproduces the broad blocks of scattering in the data . as expected a slice taken perpendicular to the kagome layers at 0.25 mev shows dispersionless streaks of scattering parallel to the @xmath94-direction in agreement with the observed 2d nature of the magnetism .",
    "versus temperature and magnetic field . proposed crossovers are indicated by the dashed lines while the dotted line indicates the maximum of the schottky - like peak .",
    "the phases are labeled as spin liquid ( sl ) at low fields and temperatures , strongly correlated precursor spin liquid at higher temperatures and ferromagnet ( fm ) at highest fields .",
    "[ fig : phase_dia ] ]    one of the main questions raised by this investigation is why the hamiltonian of ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2supports a quantum spin liquid ground state . as we have shown here , the @xmath4 cr@xmath3ions form bilayers where both layers that make up the bilayer are distorted kagome planes made from strong ferromagnetically coupled equilateral triangles alternating with weaker antiferromagnetically coupled equilateral triangles .",
    "these two planes have similar but not identical interaction strengths and are coupled together by a weak ferromagnetic interaction so that the ferromagnetic triangles in one plane couple directly to the antiferromagnetic triangles in the other plane and vice versa .",
    "all the interactions are heisenberg and there is no discernible anisotropy .",
    "ferromagnetic interactions are a well - known ingredient of spin liquids that have strong anisotropy if this anisotropy favors a non - collinear spin arrangement that competes with the parallel alignment favored by the interactions .",
    "the best example is spin ice where the magnetic ions form a pyrochlore lattice ( corner - sharing tetrahedra ) and interact via ferromagnetic dipolar interactions , which compete with the anisotropy that forces each spin to point along its local [ 1,1,1 ] direction @xcite . for magnets with isotropic interactions and no anisotropy the frustration",
    "must be generated entirely by competition between the interactions . in this situation",
    "it is generally assumed that the interactions should be predominantly antiferromagnetic as for the kagome spin liquid realized by herbertsmithite .",
    "this is because for isotropic ferromagnetic interactions , the spins can rotate and align parallel to each other on any lattice giving rise to ferromagnetic long - range order .",
    "an example of an isotropic spin liquid that has ferromagnetic interactions is kapellasite where the @xmath95 cu@xmath96 ions form a kagome lattice and interact via ferromagnetic first neighbor interactions which compete with antiferromagnetic third neighbor interactions ( diagonally across the hexagon ) @xcite .",
    "these two interactions have approximately equal strength and the system can be regarded as a network of @xmath95 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains with frustrated interchain coupling @xcite .    in order to gain further insight into the origins of the frustration in ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2and the role played by the ferromagnetic interactions ,",
    "the classical ground state from the kagome bilayers model was calculated from mean - field theory .",
    "it should of course be emphasized that this is not the real ground state which is characterized by dynamic spin motion and the absence of long - range magnetic order down to the lowest temperatures as shown in ref .",
    "nevertheless the classical ground state can provide us with a snapshot of the spin arrangement . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct](e ) the direct ( vertex to vertex ) coupling of a fm triangle ( upper triangle ) to an afm triangle ( lower triangle ) yields a motif of two coupled opposite - sign triangles whose ground states are clearly incompatible with each other .",
    "the coupling which is due to the weak fm interaction j0 prevents either triangle from achieving its ideal ground state of collinear order on the fm triangle and 120@xmath97 order in the afm triangle .",
    "this frustration introduces quantum fluctuations which destabilize long - range order , destroy the spin - wave excitations and give rise to the spin liquid state in ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "while spin - wave theory clearly can not account for the broad , diffuse magnetic excitation spectrum observed in zero magnetic field , it does provide a good description of the spectrum observed with an applied field of @xmath45  t which is close to the saturation field where the ground state has long - range ferromagnetic order . here",
    "sharp spin - wave branches are observed which are gapped and dispersive .",
    "the agreement however between spin - wave theory and the data becomes increasing worse as the field is reduced .",
    "the well - defined spin - wave modes observed in ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2broaden and lose their dispersion and the gap becomes smaller and less clean . at @xmath65  t , the lowest energy excitation branch appears to touch the elastic line and at zero field the spectrum is gapless and consists of two broad and diffuse dispersionless bands .",
    "the heat capacity and magnetization provide additional insight .",
    "heat capacity reveals the absence of any phase transition in ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2as a function of applied field and temperature , nevertheless it shows several interesting features .",
    "in particular a peak in @xmath64 appears at @xmath65  t and @xmath11  k which is the same field where the lowest magnetic excitation branch first starts to emerge from the ground state in the inelastic neutron data and where the magnetization shows a change of slope .",
    "together these results suggest that at @xmath65  t ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2crosses over from its spin liquid ground state to another as yet unknown regime .",
    "the boundary of the spin liquid phase as a function of temperature is probably @xmath11  k where the peak in @xmath64 is observed .",
    "below this temperature the spins enter a regime of persistent slow dynamics as revealed by muon spectroscopy in ref .",
    "the phase at higher temperatures can be described as a strongly correlated precursor spin liquid since the spectrum measured by neutron scattering shows a similar diffuse spectrum at @xmath98  k as at @xmath46  k.    figure [ fig : phase_dia ] shows the proposed phase diagram as a function of magnetic field and temperature plotted over the magnetic heat capacity ( @xmath99 $ ] ) . beside the spin liquid phase , the strongly correlated precursor phase and of course the ferromagnetic phase at highest fields , another crossover was observed for fields of @xmath100  t and temperatures of @xmath101  k which is yet to be explored .",
    "to conclude , the quantum spin liquid ground state of ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2arises from a complex combination of fm and afm heisenberg interactions .",
    "high - field single crystal inelastic neutron scattering allowed us to measure the exchange couplings directly , providing an accurate model of the hamiltonian .",
    "this makes ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2one of the rare examples of a quantum spin liquid for which the hamiltonian is quantitatively known and reveals that the frustration arises from a previously unexplored mechanism due to the direct coupling of fm triangles to afm triangles .",
    "the magnetic hamiltonian is used to analyze our experimental findings as a function of magnetic field and a consistent picture of a spin liquid ground state in zero field with crossovers to several other phases as a function of field and temperature is achieved . a theoretical model of the ground states and excitations under zero- and intermediate fields",
