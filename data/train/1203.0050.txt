    "combinatorial optimization has for several decades dictated the landscape of algorithm design .",
    "the extent of its impact can be appreciated by the fact that almost by default the main judging criterion of a polytime algorithmic solution is the approximation guarantee it offers , regardless of other parameters that may affect the applicability of the solution in practice ( simplicity of implementation , robustness to input errors , etc . )",
    "one such limiting assumption is the existence of an omnipotent centralized authority that has access to all the relevant information and has the power to enforce any solution of its choice . over the last decade",
    ", the soundness of such assumptions has increasingly come into question following a number of paradigm - shifting socioeconomic events such as the rapid rise of the internet , the painful realization of the extent of inter - connectivity of the global economy as well as the emergence of global sustainability concerns .",
    "algorithmic game theory strives for global optimization in such decentralized settings that consist of self - interested individuals . in these more challenging scenarios ,",
    "tractability can be compromised along two largely independent axes : due to individual incentive issues or due to computability issues .",
    "* price of anarchy .",
    "* the competition between individual incentives and social optimality is of fundamental concern in distributed systems as it can lead to highly inefficient outcomes .",
    "the price of anarchy literature @xcite examines exactly what are the worst case repercussions of such a policy .",
    "formally , price of anarchy is defined as the maximal ratio between the social cost of a nash equilibrium and that of the global optimal configuration .",
    "intuitively , a low price of anarchy implies that upon converging to a socially stable outcome , the quality of the acquired solution is almost optimal from a central optimization perspective .",
    "unfortunately , in many cases of interesting games the price of anarchy is prohibitively high .",
    "vertex cover , due to its prominent position within combinatorial optimization , has been studied in the context of game theory from different approaches , all of which so far have shared this limiting characteristic .",
    "specifically , cardinal and hoefer in @xcite define a vertex cover game where the edges of a network are owned by @xmath1 agents .",
    "an agent s goal is to have each of his edges supplied by a service point at least one of its endpoints .",
    "there is a cost @xmath2 associated to building a service point at vertex @xmath3 .",
    "the strategy of an agent is a vector consisting of offers to the vertices .",
    "service points will be installed at vertices where the total offer exceeds the cost of the vertex .",
    "similar games are defined by buchbinder et al .",
    "@xcite and by escoffier et al .",
    "@xcite for the more general set cover problem .",
    "a different approach was followed by balcan et al .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the agents are the vertices of the graph , and their strategies are deciding whether they open a service point .",
    "if opening a service point , vertex @xmath3 incurs a cost @xmath4 .",
    "if he decides not to open , he has to pay a penalty for all edges incident to @xmath3 whose other endpoints are uncovered .",
    "the price of anarchy is @xmath5 in @xcite and @xmath6 in @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if the underlying network is a star , and each edge is owned by a different agent in the first case , we get nash equilibria with all leaves being service points . these guarantees are significantly worse than the ones available in the centralized setting , where simple factor @xmath0-approximation algorithms exist .    in contrast , in our paper , we shall present a simple vertex cover game with a price of anarchy @xmath0 . as in @xcite ,",
    "the agents are the vertices , and the regulations delegate the responsibility of covering every edge of the network to its two endpoints : both incur a high penalty if the edge is left uncovered . the difference from the setting of @xcite is that those who open a service point can demand compensation from their neighbors .",
    "this is justified since if @xmath7 opens a service point , every neighbor @xmath3 benefits from this as the common responsibility of covering @xmath8 is taken over by @xmath7 .    in the description ,",
    "we use intuitive terminology of a mafia ( service points ) which provides `` security '' ( covers edges ) . the vertices may choose to join mafia or to remain civilians .",
    "each edge of the graph has to be `` secured '' , that is , at least one endpoint must be in mafia . for agent @xmath3",
    ", there is an initial cost @xmath4 to join mafia .",
    "mafiosi can collect ransoms as the price of security of the incident edges : if a vertex @xmath3 chooses to be a mafioso , his strategy also includes a ransom vector , so that the total ransom he demands from his neighbors is @xmath4 .",
    "it is a one - shot game and mafiosi can ransom both their civilian and mafioso neighbors .",
    "if @xmath3 is a civilian , he has to pay to his neighbors in the mafia all ransom they demand . furthermore , if there is an incident uncovered edge @xmath8 , that is , @xmath7 is also a civilian , both of them have to pay a huge penalty .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath3 is a mafioso , he has to pay @xmath4 for joining , and he receives whatever he can collect from ransoms .",
    "however , mafiosi ransomed excessively obtain a protected status : if the total demand from @xmath3 is more than @xmath4 , he satisfies only a proportional fraction of the demands .",
    "it is important to note that the payoff function is defined locally : besides his own strategy , the payoff of an agent depends only on the strategies of agents at distance at most @xmath0 from him ( i.e. immediate neighbors and neighbors of neighbors ) . also note that if @xmath9 is a vertex cover , then the total utility of the agents is @xmath10",
    "consequently , an optimal solution to the optimization problem gives a social optimum of the game .    as a different interpretation of the game above , consider a road network with the vertices representing cities .",
    "the maintenance of a road must be provided by a facility at one of the endpoints .",
    "the cost of opening the facility dominates the operating cost : if city @xmath3 decides to open one at cost @xmath4 , it is able to maintain all incident roads . as a compensation , the cities can try to recollect the opening cost by asking contributions from the neighboring cities . a city without a facility has to pay all contributions he is asked to pay .",
    "however , if a city opens a facility , its liability is limited and has to satisfy demands only up to his opening cost , @xmath4 .",
    "our approach can be extended to the hitting set problem , which is equivalent to the set cover problem .",
    "we are given a hypergraph @xmath11 , and a cost function @xmath12 on the vertices .",
    "our aim is to find a minimum cost subset @xmath9 of @xmath13 intersecting every hyperedge in @xmath14 .",
    "this problem is known to be approximable within a factor of @xmath15 , the maximum size of a hyperedge . in the corresponding mafia game ,",
    "the hyperedges shall be considered as clubs in need of security .",
    "a mafioso can assign ransoms to the clubs he is a member of , that will be distributed equally to all other members of the club .",
    "we shall prove that for the vertex cover and hitting set games , the price of anarchy is 2 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "bar yehuda and even gave a simple primal - dual algorithm with this guarantee in 1981 @xcite .",
    "no better constant factor approximation has been given eversince .",
    "furthermore , assuming the unique games conjecture , khot and regev @xcite proved that the hitting set problem can not be approximated by any constant factor smaller than @xmath15 .    as a further extension",
    ", we also investigate the submodular hitting set ( or set cover ) problem , that has received significant attention recently .",
    "the goal is to find a hitting set @xmath9 of a hypergraph minimizing @xmath16 for a submodular set function @xmath17 on the ground set .",
    "independently , koufogiannakis and young @xcite and iwata and nagano @xcite gave @xmath15-approximation algorithms .",
    "our game approach extends even to this setting , with the same price of anarchy @xmath15 .",
    "this involves a new agent , the godfather , who s strategy consists of setting a budget vector in the submodular base polyhedron of @xmath17 .",
    "otherwise , the game is essentially the same as the ( linear ) hitting set game .",
    "the main results of the paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "the mafia games for vertex cover , hitting set and submodular hitting set always have pure nash equilibria , and the price of anarchy is 2 for vertex cover and @xmath15 for ( submodular ) hitting set .",
    "recent work of roughgarden et al .",
    "@xcite has shown that the majority of positive results in price of anarchy literature can be reduced to a specific common set of structural assumptions .",
    "in contrast , in our work , we use a novel approach by exploring connections to the lp relaxations of the underlying centralized optimization problems .",
    "this connection raises interesting questions about the limits of its applicability .",
    "* convergence and complexity of dynamics .",
    "*    in our covering games , we first show that even in simple instances , round robin best response dynamics may end in a loop .",
    "however , this can be simply fixed by a slight modification of the payoff .",
    "we introduce a secondary utility , that does not affect the price of anarchy results , but merely instigates the mafiosi to use more fair ( symmetric ) ransoms : @xmath18 . with this secondary objective ,",
    "we show that actually a single round of best response dynamics under a simple selection rule of the next agent results in a nash - equilibrium .",
    "this dynamics in fact simulates the bar - yehuda  even algorithm .",
    "an analogous dynamics is shown in the case of hitting set . moreover",
    ", these dynamics can be interpreted in a distributed manner , enabling several agents to change their strategies at the same time .    in our games , the set of strategies is infinite as ransoms can be arbitrary real numbers .",
    "however , if the vertex weights are integers , we can restrict possible ransoms to be integers as well .",
    "all results of the paper straightforwardly extend to this finite game .",
    "the basic set cover games in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite fall into the class of congestion games @xcite . in the models of @xcite , @xcite , in the hitting set terminology",
    ", the agents are the hyperedges that choose a vertex to cover them , and the cost of the vertex is divided among them according to some rule .",
    "@xcite investigates the influence of a central authority that can influence choices by taxes and subsidies in a best response dynamics ; @xcite studies different cost sharing rules of the vertices ( `` local taxes '' ) .",
    "however , none of these methods achieve a constant price of anarchy .",
    "the model of @xcite can achieve a good equilibrium by assuming a central authority that propagates information on an optimal solution to a fraction of the agents .",
    "in contrast to @xcite and @xcite , our model is defined locally , without assuming a central authority .",
    "cardinal and hoefer @xcite define a general class of covering games , including the vertex cover game @xcite , and also the selfish network design game by anshelevich et al . @xcite .",
    "the game is based on a covering problem given by a linear integer program .",
    "variables represent resources , and the agents correspond to certain sets of constraints they have to satisfy . an agent can offer money for resources needed to satisfy her constraints . from each variable ,",
    "the number of units covered by the total offers of the agents will be purchased and can be used by all agents simultaneously to satisfy their constraints , regardless to their actual contributions to the resource .",
    "our games can be seen as the _ duals _ of these coverings games .",
    "that is , the agents correspond to the variables , and are responsible for the satisfaction of the constraints containing them .",
    "if a constraint is left unsatisfied , the participating variables get punished .",
    "also , a variable may require compensation ( ransoms ) from other variables participating in the same constraints .",
    "these compensations will correspond to a dual solution in a nash equilibrium .",
    "we hope that our approach of studying dual covering games might be extended to a broader class of problems , with the price of anarchy matching the integrality gap .",
    "the performance of behavioral dynamics in games and specifically establishing fast convergence to equilibria of good quality has been the subject of intensive recent research @xcite .",
    "the importance of such results that go beyond the analysis of performance of nash equilibria has been stressed in @xcite where it has been shown that even in very simple games with constant number of agents and strategies , the performance of simple learning dynamics can be arbitrarily different than ( any convex combination of ) the payoffs of nash equilibria .",
    "given a graph @xmath19 , let @xmath20 be a cost function on the vertices . in the _ vertex cover problem _ , the task is to find a minimum cost set @xmath21 containing at least one endpoint of every edge in @xmath22 . for a vertex @xmath23 , let @xmath24 denote the set of its neighbors .",
