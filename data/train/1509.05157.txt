    "double-@xmath0 decay is a process in which a nucleus @xmath14 decays to a nucleus @xmath15 by emitting two electrons or positrons and , usually , other light particles @xmath16 double-@xmath0 decay can be classified in various modes according to the various types of particles emitted in the decay .",
    "the processes where two neutrinos are emitted are predicted by the standard model , and @xmath17 decay has been observed in several nuclei . for processes not allowed by the standard model , i.e. the neutrinoless modes : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , the half - life can be factorized as @xmath21^{-1}=g_{0\\nu}|m_{0\\nu}|^2 \\left| f(m_i , u_{ei})\\right|^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a phase space factor , @xmath23 is the nuclear matrix element , and @xmath24 contains physics beyond the standard model through the masses @xmath25 and mixing matrix elements @xmath26 of neutrino species .",
    "for all processes , two crucial ingredients are the phase space factors ( psfs ) and the nuclear matrix elements ( nmes ) .",

    "this is the most promising mode for the possible detection of neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay and thus of a measurement of the absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "however , in very recent years , interest in the double positron decay , @xmath2 , positron emitting electron capture , @xmath3 , and double electron capture @xmath4 , has been renewed .",
    "this is due to the fact that positron emitting processes have interesting signatures that could be detected experimentally @xcite . in a previous article",

    "the process @xmath20 can not occur to the order of approximation used in @xcite , since the emission of additional particles , @xmath31 or others , is needed to conserve energy and momentum . in this article , we focus on calculation of neutrinoless decay nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) , which are common to all three modes , and half - life predictions for @xmath30 and @xmath32 modes .",
