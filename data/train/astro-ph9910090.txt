    "if galaxy merging is a common process in the cores of galaxy groups , then there may be a population of ` fossil ' groups in which most of the galaxies have merged , leaving a giant elliptical galaxy but few other galaxies .",
    "galaxy groups represent one of the environments where galaxy mergers are predicted to happen most frequently , because of the relatively low velocity dispersion of the constituent galaxies compared to the velocity dispersion in clusters of galaxies .",
    "for example , in the numerical simulations of barnes ( 1985 , 1989 ) compact group members merge to form a single elliptical galaxy within a few billion years . in hierarchical models of structure formation , isolated galaxy groups",
    "are predicted to be relatively old systems , so that there has been a long period over which merging could occur .",
    "the first candidate fossil galaxy group , rxj1340.6 + 4018 , was discovered via its extended x - ray emission by ponman et al ( 1994 ; hereafter p94 ) .",
    "the x - ray properties of the system , including its bolometric x - ray luminosity ( 4.5x10@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ) , temperature ( 0.92@xmath60.08 kev ) and extent ( core radius 140 - 390 kpc ) , are similar to those of well known x - ray bright galaxy groups ( e.g. mulchaey et al 1996 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity and extent are at least an order of magnitude higher than those of normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , p94 detected no excess of galaxies in projection on the sky near the x - ray position ; only a single luminous ( @xmath7=23.5 mag ) elliptical galaxy was coincident with the x - ray peak .",
    "the explanation suggested by p94 was that the former group galaxies had merged , creating the single luminous elliptical galaxy and leaving a halo of x - ray emitting gas and dark matter .",
    "in a recent study , vikhlinin et al ( 1999 ) find three very similar systems , in addition to independently discovering , and find that the space density of such groups is similar to that of luminous field ellipticals with @xmath8 ( m@xmath922.5 ) .",
    "thus a large fraction of luminous field ellipticals may be the result of galaxy merging in groups .",
    "x - ray observations of an optically - selected isolated elliptical galaxy by mulchaey & zabludoff ( 1999 ) also revealed a system with the x - ray properties of a group , lending support to this idea .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the properties of rxj1340.6 + 4018 in more detail and assess the evidence for it being a result of galaxy merging .",
    "if it _ is _ an old merger remnant then comparison with typical ellipticals gives a valuable check on the idea that many ellipticals are the result of mergers .",
    "the detection of an overluminous x - ray halo containing only one bright ( elliptical ) galaxy may be one of the few ways of identifying such evolved systems .    in section 2",
    "we describe new optical imaging and spectroscopy and high resolution x - ray observations of the field .",
    "the results of isophotal , photometric and dynamical analyses of the central galaxy and its environment are described in section 3 .",
    "a comparison with other galaxy systems and a discussion of the possible history of this system are given in section 4 .",
    "the last section contains the concluding remarks .",
    "we assume h@xmath10=5050 mpc@xmath5 and q@xmath10=0.5 throughout ( as done by p94 ) .",
    "low resolution spectra of rxj1340.6 + 4018 and objects close to it on the sky were obtained at the kitt peak 2.1 m telescope on january 21st 1996 . a finding chart is shown in fig",
    "two slit positions were used . at one ,",
    "spectra of objects g2 , g9 , g7 & s4 were obtained ( position angle 79 ; exposure 60 min ) .",
    "the star s4 is outside the area of fig . 1 , to the east .",
    "at the other slit position spectra of objects g1 , g3 and g5 were obtained ( position angle 71 ; exposure 30 min ) .",
    "object g1 is the central , luminous elliptical galaxy .",
    "the second slit was aligned on galaxies g3 & g5 and so did not quite cross the core of g1 , but passed 2 arcsec south of the core . the goldcam spectrograph and ford 3kx1k ccd were used with a slitwidth of 2.5 arcsec and a grating of 300 lines / mm , giving a resolution of 10  ( fwhm ) .",
    "arc lamp , flat field and f8 star exposures ( the latter for the removal of atmospheric absorption features ) were obtained with the telescope at or near the position of rxj1340.6 + 4018 .",
    "spectra of flux standard stars were obtained during the night .",
    "standard iraf reduction procedures were used and redshifts were determined from gaussian fits to 4 - 8 absorption lines per galaxy .",
    "redshift errors were determined from the dispersion in the individual line measurements .",
    "the redshifts are listed in table 1 .",
    "the redshift of g1 ( z=0.1716 ) agrees with the measurement of p94 .",
    "three of the other galaxies observed ( g2 , g3 and g5 ) have redshifts very close to that of g1 ( @xmath11v@xmath12450 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "the spectra of all four of these galaxies are typical of elliptical galaxies .",
    "two objects ( g7 & g9 ) are background galaxies and one object ( s4 ) is a galactic star .",
    "the only emission lines detected were unresolved [ oii]3727 in the background galaxies g7 and g9 , a common feature in faint field galaxies .",

    "these properties are defined by the fundamental plane .    in order to test if the central galaxy g1 lies on the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies , the central velocity dispersion , the effective radius and the mean surface brightness are required . to compare with the fundamental plane of djorgovski & davis ( 1987 )",
    ", we used their definitions : the effective semi - major axis a@xmath18 from r@xmath19 profile fits and the mean surface brightness @xmath20 within a@xmath18 in the lick r@xmath21 band .",
    "we used h@xmath10=100 mpc@xmath5 to be consistent with djorgovski & davis ( 1987 ) ( as opposed to the value of h@xmath10=50 mpc@xmath5 used throughout the rest of this paper ) .",
    "the r band measurements ( on the kron - cousins system ) were converted to the lick r@xmath21 band via the equations given in djorgovski ( 1985 ) and bessell ( 1979 ) .",
    "the values found ( a@xmath18=20@xmath61.1 h@xmath22 kpc , @xmath23=21.37 mag arcsec@xmath24 and @xmath25=260@xmath630 ) lie almost exactly on the fundamental plane relation of djorgovski & davis ( 1987 ) and are certainly consistent with the galaxy g1 being on the fundamental plane within our measurement errors .",
    "we tested for consistency using the b band fundamental plane parameters , as given in table 3 .",
    "the galaxy was again found to lie on the fundamental plane , defined in the b band by the data of prugniel & simien ( 1996 ) .",
    "the mg@xmath17 absorption line index is an age / metallicity indicator .",
    "the index , as defined by dressler ( 1984 ) and faber et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , is the depression , in magnitudes , of the intensity at wavelengths 5157 - 5198  compared to continuum sidebands . the mean value from the kpno 2.1 m spectrum and the keck spectrum was 0.30@xmath60.15 .",
    "this value is consistent with the elliptical mg@xmath17-@xmath25 relation of bender , burstein & faber ( 1993 ) , where @xmath25 is the central velocity dispersion .",
    "we also note that the measured rest - frame ( v - r)@xmath10 colour of the galaxy is consistent with the colour - magnitude relation of prugniel & simien ( 1996 ) .",
    "if galaxy merging is an important process , then there may be signs of it in galaxies close to the group centre .",
    "the colours and mean surface brightnesses of galaxies at a range of projected radii from the dominant galaxy were measured and are plotted in fig .",
    "10 . only relatively bright galaxies ( r@xmath1221.5 ) were investigated , since colours were available for all of these galaxies in the area studied .",
    "the colours were measured on images with the dominant elliptical galaxy g1 subtracted , and using fixed apertures of 4.7 arcsec diameter .",
    "the b - r colours are accurate relative to each other , but are not accurate in an absolute sense because of the lack of b band calibration .    of the five galaxies within 200 50@xmath5 kpc of the centre of the dominant elliptical galaxy ( shown as filled squares in fig .",
    "10 ) , three are outliers from the general distribution . galaxy g10 ( identified in fig .",
    "1 ) is the bluest of all the galaxies and has a low mean r band surface brightness .",
    "its unusual appearance can be best seen in fig .",
    "5 . ignoring galaxy g4 , which appears to be projected behind a foreground star , galaxy g3 has one of the highest surface brightnesses .",
    "both of these galaxies are very close ( in projection ) to the central galaxy ; both are within its isophotes .",
    "in addition , galaxy g11 is very red .",
    "although we have no redshift for galaxy g10 , its location only 9 arcsec ( or 35 kpc ) from the centre of the dominant galaxy , and its exceptional colour and appearance argue strongly for an association between the two galaxies .",
    "its blue colour relative to other galaxies in the field suggests recent star formation .",
    "this is not , however , a major merger .",
    "galaxy g10 emits @xmath121% of the r band light of the dominant galaxy .",
    "one interpretation of the high surface brightness and small size of the other unusual nearby galaxy , g3 , is that it is the high - density nuclear remains of a brighter galaxy . in any case",
    ", the high fraction of abnormal galaxies close to the central galaxy suggests that interactions are occurring .",
    "the rosat hri data allow an investigation of the properties of the hot x - ray emitting gas at the centre of the group , coincident with the dominant galaxy .",
    "we have performed a joint fit of all the x - ray data ( pspc spectral images and hri image ) to a model of the x - ray emitting gas , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and a king profile for the gas density variation with radius but with the metallicity fixed at the integrated value determined by p94 .",
    "the spatial and spectral instrument response functions were included as described in ponman & bertram ( 1993 ) .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry is reasonable in the core of the group .",
    "we find that the cooling time of the x - ray gas decreases with decreasing radius , and is below 10 gyr for r@xmath260.8 arcmin ( 190 50@xmath5 kpc ) .",
    "the cooling time is @xmath31 gyr for r@xmath126 arcsec . using the method of white , jones & forman ( 1997 )",
    "we derive a mass deposition rate within r=0.8 arcmin of 45 m@xmath27 yr@xmath5 for a steady state cooling flow . however , we find no evidence of a strong decrease in the x - ray temperature at the group centre , as measured by the pspc .",
    "this could be due to the cooling flow being young , with insufficient time for widespread cooling to set in after disruption by galaxy merging perhaps 3 - 4 gyr ago .",
    "however , the rather poor pspc spatial resolution ( @xmath1525 arcsec ) may be blurring the observed temperature profile such that , within the limited statistical accuracy , the central temperature decrement is not observed .",
    "was selected from an x - ray survey .",
    "poor clusters selected optically on the basis of the d or cd - like appearance of the brightest galaxy include those of morgan , kayser & white ( 1975 , hereafter mkw ) and albert , white & morgan ( 1978 , hereafter awm ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity , x - ray temperature , velocity dispersion , mass estimates and mass / light ratio of all lie within the range of the same parameters of the mkw / awm poor clusters ( kriss , cioffi and canizares 1983 ; beers et al 1995 ; bahcall 1980 ) .",
    "the distribution of the galaxy optical luminosities is , however , very different in .",
    "the extreme nature of the value of 12=2.5 mag for can be appreciated from the comparison with the distribution of 12 in poor clusters shown in fig .",
    "the comparison samples are the 25 optically selected poor clusters of price et al ( 1991 ) and the 15 mkw / awm clusters of beers et al ( 1995 ) with @xmath28 galaxy redshifts .",
    "the mean of these distributions is 12=0.4 - 0.5 . using a different sample of 16 mkw / awm clusters , and based on photometry alone , bode et al ( 1994 ) quote a median 12 of 0.8 and a range of 0.1 to 1.8 .",
    "the mkw / awm clusters were selected to contain a dominant giant elliptical galaxy , and thus should have larger values of 12 than randomly selected groups , but even compared to this sample , has an extreme 12 value .    to quantify the random probability of obtaining a value of 12@xmath292.5 , we performed 14000 monte carlo realisations of luminosity functions with the absolute magnitudes selected at random from a schechter function distribution .",
    "we used two of the lfs shown in fig .",
    "11 with extreme values of the faint end slope , and a faint limit of m@xmath30=-16 , as in our observations . using the mkw / awm composite poor cluster lf of yamagata & maehara ( 1986 ) , which has a flat faint end slope ( @xmath31=-1.07 ) we found that less than 0.1% of the simulated lfs had 12@xmath32 .",
    "the mean and median 12 values were 0.48 and 0.38 , and the 12 distribution is shown in fig .",
    "11 . for the composite poor group lf of ferguson & sandage ( 1991 ) , with the steepest faint end slope ( @xmath31=-1.39 ) , a larger fraction of galaxies had faint luminosities , resulting in higher values of 12 ( 1.2% of the simulated lfs had 12@xmath32 ) .",
    "the mean and median 12 values were 0.71 and 0.55 , less consistent with the observed distributions in fig .",
    "11 .    to compare the simulated random probabilities with the number of observed systems we use the results of jones et al ( 1999 ) who find @xmath155% of 100 x - ray",
    "selected groups and clusters in the warps survey have 12@xmath32 , together with the results of vikhlinin et al ( 1999 ) , who estimate from 4 similar systems that they comprise @xmath1520% of all clusters and groups of comparable x - ray luminosity .",
    "these estimates are significantly larger than the 0.1%-1% predicted from random selection , suggesting that some other formation process is at work .",
    "if this other process is galaxy merging , how many l@xmath0 galaxies are required to form the dominant galaxy ? given the mean m@xmath33 of -23.0 for the lfs in fig .",
    "11 , the answer is @xmath153 .",
    "three galaxies is also consistent with the number missing from the gap in the observed lf between the first and second brightest galaxies .",
    "a few of hickson s compact groups ( hcgs ) have apparently large 12 values ( eg .",
    "11 of prandoni et al 1994 ) but these are generally due to the projection of unrelated foreground galaxies on to the groups ; indeed hcgs were deliberately chosen to contain at least four galaxies of similar magnitude ( within 3 mag of the brightest galaxy ) , so the selection criteria should bias them toward low values of 12 .",
    "related measurements are the fraction of the total group light in the dominant galaxy and the central galaxy surface density n@xmath10 . from the lf of fig",
    ". 7 at r@xmath12400 50 kpc we find that @xmath1570% of the group light arises from the central galaxy . we have used a limiting absolute magnitude of m@xmath30=16 to calculate this fraction but the result is valid for any absolute magnitude limit fainter than m@xmath3419 because the luminosity function integral converges . by comparison , the fraction of the virgo cluster light arising in m87 is only @xmath155% , as derived from the data of sandage , binggeli & tammann ( 1985 ) and using a corresponding absolute magnitude limit .",
    "the virgo cluster bolometric x - ray luminosity is similar to that of ( white , jones & forman 1997 ) .",
    "the fractions of the cluster light emitted by the brightest cluster galaxies in the mkw / awm poor clusters have intermediate values bewteen 11% and 40% ( from the data of thuan & romanishin 1981 ) , and a similar range of values is found in the rich cluster data of oemler ( 1976 ) , including clusters containing cd galaxies .",
    "thus the fraction of light in the dominant galaxy in has an extreme value compared to a wide range of other systems .",
    "the value of the central galaxy surface density , n@xmath35 , as defined by bahcall ( 1981 ) , was measured as 2.8 , assuming a richness correction appropriate for a richness class -3 group .",
    "the value for the virgo cluster is 10 ( bahcall 1981 ) .",
    "abell richness class 0 - 1 clusters typically have n@xmath35=10 - 50 .",
    "we now make a comparison of with hickson compact groups .",
    "is more luminous in x - rays than any of the 85 hickson compact groups studied by ponman et al ( 1996 ) , and is a factor @xmath315 more luminous than the typical hcg detected .",
    "the group optical luminosity of is comparable to that of the brightest hickson groups , so the @xmath36/@xmath37 ratio of 0.04 is higher than any of the hcgs .",
    "in contrast , the x - ray temperature lies within the range found for hcgs by ponman et al ( 1996 ) and lies on the @xmath38 relation for hcgs .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of is high for its x - ray temperature , and it does not lie on the @xmath2 relation of clusters or of groups .",
    "12 shows the @xmath2 relation for clusters at z@xmath120.2 using data compiled from several sources .",
    "the solid line is the best fit using only clusters with @xmath391 kev ( @xmath40 ; fairley et al 1999 ) .",
    "groups of galaxies with temperatures @xmath121 kev show a systematic trend to have _ low _ x - ray luminosities for a given temperature , as already noted by ponman et al ( 1996 ) , but has the opposite property .",
    "infact has the largest deviation above the best fit @xmath2 relation of any of the clusters or groups in the plot .",
    "the luminous central galaxy of does not have the characteristic envelope of cd galaxies , which would be visible as an excess surface brightness above the r@xmath19 law at @xmath4125 mag arcsec@xmath24 ( eg . schombert 1986 ) .",
    "thuan & romanishin ( 1981 ) found that the brightest galaxies in mkw and awm poor clusters were also missing cd extended envelopes .",
    "they suggested that the origin of cd envelopes in rich clusters is tidally stripped matter falling on to the central galaxy , but as tidal stripping ( by the cluster potential ) is less efficient in groups , cd envelopes do not form there .",
    "the total luminosity of galaxy g1 ( m@xmath42=-23.4 ) is similar to that of the brightest galaxies in the poor awm & mkw groups studied by thuan & romanishin ( 1981 ) and to their estimates of the total luminosities of cd galaxies in rich clusters , when the cd envelope luminosities were excluded .",
    "the lack of features in the residual images after subtraction of the elliptical model in both the b and r bands shows that there are no major dust lanes in the galaxy .",
    "thus either any dust is smoothly distributed , the progenitor galaxies were dust - free , or any dust has been sputtered by the hot x - ray gas .    with the current x - ray data we can not separate the x - ray luminosity of the central galaxy from the x - ray luminosity of the group .",
    "thus we can not investigate the @xmath36/@xmath37 ratio of the galaxy alone .",
    "the log(@xmath36/@xmath37 ) value for the group ( -1.4 ) is @xmath310 - 100 times larger than that for normal elliptical galaxies .      because of the old ages and lack of evolution found for luminous brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) ,",
    "it has been suggested that they may have formed before clusters , within groups , which then merged .",
    "it is interesting to note that lies in the outskirts of the richness class 2 cluster a1774 .",
    "a1774 has a redshift of z=0.1691 ( struble & rood 1987 ) , corresponding to a line - of - sight velocity difference of only 475 with .",
    "the projected separation is 18.2 arcmin , corresponding to 4.1 mpc , so is in the outskirts of a1774 and is part of the large - scale structure associated with a1774 .",
    "there is no cd galaxy in a1774 ; the cluster has a bautz - morgan class of iii , the class with least dominant cluster galaxies .",
    "the centre of a1774 is south of in a direction some @xmath1525from the x - ray position angle of galaxy g1 .",
    "if is falling into a1774 , then the approximate alignment of the x - ray isophotes , and probably also the dark matter distribution , with the direction of a1774 , is suggestive of infall along a filamentary structure , as observed in galaxy redshift surveys and predicted in hydrodynamic simulations of large - scale structure formation ( eg .",
    "katz , hernquist & weinberg 1992 ) . in a detailed n - body simulation of a poor cluster within a hierarchical cosmological model dubinski ( 1998 ) found that after 3 gyr ( ie .",
    "by z@xmath150.8 ) the four most massive galaxies had merged along a primordial dark matter filament .",
    "the final luminous giant elliptical galaxy at the cluster core had its major axis aligned along the filament , and the appearance of the galaxies at z=0 was very similar to the observations presented here .",
    "if the central galaxy has formed via multiple mergers , then the last major merger probably occurred several gyr ago , because there are now no morphological signs left of merging activity ( boxy isophotes , shells or tidal tails ) .",
    "the galaxy lies on the fundamental plane , colour - magnitude and metallicity- velocity dispersion relations of normal ellipticals .",
    "the time since the last major starburst , according to the correlation of deviation from the fundamental plane with spectroscopic age of forbes et al ( 1998 ) , is @xmath14 gyr .",
    "an estimate of the age of the stellar population can be made using the lick line index system as defined by worthey ( 1994 ) .",
    "although we can not do a full correction to the lick system , the h@xmath43 line index is sufficiently small ( equivalent width= 0.8@xmath60.2  ) to rule out a young age and is consistent with the oldest ages in the worthey models ie .",
    "18 gyr .",
    "dynamical friction causes massive galaxies to lose energy and spiral in toward the group centre ( eg .",
    "white 1976 ) .",
    "the timescale for dynamical friction can be estimated using the equations given by binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) which integrate the chandrasekhar ( 1943 ) dynamical friction force as a galaxy falls toward the group centre . assuming the total gravitating mass is proportional to r@xmath24 , consistent with our analysis of the x - ray data , and the galaxy is initially on a circular orbit of radius 200 kpc with velocity @xmath44 , an l@xmath45 galaxy with a typical mass / light ratio of 10 m@xmath27/l@xmath27",
    "is predicted to fall into the group centre in @xmath34.5x10@xmath46 yr .",
    "thus the lack of observed l@xmath45 galaxies within a radius of 200 kpc is consistent with the effects of dynamical friction acting over a substantial fraction of a hubble time .",
    "the x - ray observations of require a massive dark halo to gravitationally bind the hot x - ray gas .",
    "the fraction of dark matter initially distributed in halos around individual galaxies , rather than distributed throughout the group , is not known .",
    "dark galaxy halos may be stripped by galaxy interactions .    in the simulations of virialized poor clusters of bode",
    "et al ( 1994 ) , if 50% of the dark matter is initially in galaxy halos , galaxy merging occurs and a dominant central galaxy is produced after @xmath31x10@xmath47 yr .",
    "most mergers involved the dominant galaxy .",
    "this galaxy contains a third or more of the luminous matter in the cluster and accretes 0.5 - 5@xmath48 .",
    "the mass function , which was initially continuous , develops a gap of a factor @xmath156 in mass between the most massive galaxy and the second most massive .    the similarities between the properties predicted by the simulations of bode et al ( 1994 ) and the observed properties of are striking : the gap in the predicted mass function and the gap in our observed luminosity function ( of 12=2.5 mag or a factor of 10 ) , the total luminosity ( @xmath153l@xmath45 ) and the high fraction of the total cluster light in the dominant galaxy .",
    "in the same simulations , if all the dark matter is initially distributed throughout the group , the initial galaxy masses are smaller , and the dynamical friction timescales are longer .",
    "merging is delayed beyond 13 gyr , and a central dominant galaxy is not produced .",
    "thus , according to these simulations ( in which the dark halos were @xmath49 times more massive than the luminous matter ) , if merging is a dominant process , the extreme properties of the system could only be produced if galaxies initially had massive dark halos .",
    "governato , tozzi & cavaliere ( 1996 ) note that the merger rate for galaxies with very massive dark matter halos ( @xmath504 times the luminous matter mass ) may not be faster than for galaxies with less massive halos . in the collapse phase ,",
    "included in their simulations , unequal dark matter halos are tidally stripped to about the same size and mass .",
    "the simulations of galaxy groups of governato , tozzi & cavaliere ( 1996 ) also produced a ` merging runaway ' ( cavaliere , colafrancesco & menci 1991 ) in which a large fraction of the galaxies merged to produce one or two central massive galaxies in a few crossing times after the initial collapse of the central region .",
    "these simulations started in a non - virialized state and included galaxy infall .",
    "governato et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also use the press - schechter ( 1974 ) formalism to predict a larger fraction of systems like in an open , @xmath51=0.2 universe than in an @xmath51=1 universe . in an open universe only 10%-15% of groups",
    "were predicted to have formed since z=0.3 , compared to 30%-50% of groups in a critical density universe . in the open universe predictions",
    "there was also little galaxy infall into groups , and group ages corresponded to a significantly larger number of crossing times than in a critical density universe . for either value of @xmath51 , governato et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that most galaxy merging occurred at high redshifts z@xmath500.3 ( and still higher redshifts for an open universe ) , so the observed lack of morphological signs of merging is not surprising .",
    "the detailed properties and statistics of systems like may therefore help to constrain cosmological parameters and/or galaxy formation models .",
    "the large gap in the galaxy luminosity function and the very high fraction of the group light emitted by the central galaxy suggest that galaxy merging has occurred , as predicted by simulations of groups .",
    "at least one neighbouring galaxy ( g10 ) has an extreme colour and may be interacting with the central galaxy .",
    "however , the undisturbed , relaxed morphology of the central galaxy , its location on the fundamental plane of ellipticals and the lack of strong balmer absorption lines in the optical spectrum show that a major merger ( causing major star formation activity ) has not occurred recently ( within 4 gyr ) .",
    "this suggests that the majority of the merging occurred at an early epoch , consistent with dynamical friction predictions which would leave only low mass galaxies merging at later times .",
    "there are other pieces of evidence that suggest the system was formed at an early epoch .",
    "the deviation of the system from the @xmath2 relation towards high x - ray luminosities can be explained in simple terms by an early formation epoch . at early times , the higher density of the universe leads to a higher gas density and thus a higher x - ray luminosity ( since @xmath52  n@xmath53 ) .",
    "there are puzzles remaining though .",
    "the lack of evidence for a strong cooling flow is a puzzle if the system is old , although the spatial resolution of our x - ray data may be insufficient to resolve the central temperature decrement .",
    "the elongation of the x - ray isophotes suggests that the dark matter distribution is also elongated , and thus may not be relaxed , as would be expected in an old system .",
    "the intruiging possibility that is in a filamentary structure related to the infall of mass on to a1774 remains .",
    "the similarity of the optical galaxy ellipticity at large radii to the x - ray ellipticity , together with the approximate alignment of the optical isophotes with the x - ray isophotes , supports the observed x - ray elongation and suggests that the stars in the outer regions of the galaxy may be responding to the _ group - sized _ dark matter distribution .",
    "while ellipticity increasing with radius and alignment with cluster structure may be a common feature of cd galaxies ( eg .",
    "dressler 1978 ) , it is rarely observed in regular giant ellipticals without cd envelopes .",
    "we have measured four concordant galaxy redshifts showing that the system is a group of galaxies .",
    "rosat hri x - ray observations confirm that the x - ray emission is diffuse .",
    "the x - ray properties of the group are not unlike those of the optically selected mkw and awm poor clusters and groups , which were selected to have dominant giant ellipticals .",
    "however , the giant elliptical in dominates the group to an extreme degree ; the second brightest galaxy is a factor of 10 less luminous ( 12=2.5 mag ) , and 70% of the group optical light originates in the dominant elliptical .",
    "this large magnitude gap , combined with the poorness of the system , would make it difficult to detect in two - dimensional optical surveys .",
    "the gap in the group galaxy luminosity function occurs @xmath3l@xmath0 and the missing luminosity is consistent with the luminosity of the dominant galaxy .",
    "we interpret the properties of the group in terms of merging of l@xmath0 galaxies at an early epoch , leaving behind low mass galaxies , as predicted by dynamical friction .",
    "fossil groups like may be the long sought - after descendents of hcgs .    in this interpretation",
    ", the epoch of merging must have been early ( @xmath14 gyr ago ) .",
    "the undisturbed morphology of the dominant galaxy , its location on the fundamental plane of ellipticals and the lack of young star features in its optical spectrum all suggest no recent merging or star formation activity .",
    "however , the marked elongation of the x - ray isophotes is more consistent with a young , unrelaxed system .",
    "future x - ray observations will determine the detailed structure of the system as well as any relation to the nearby cluster a1774 .    clearly",
    "more examples of groups similar to need to be found before any firm statements about their space density can be made .",
    "we are searching for similar systems in the warps x - ray selected survey ( scharf et al 1997 , jones et al 1998 ) .",
    "initial results indicate that there are indeed several similar systems .",
    "detailed observations of these fossil systems will determine the importance of merging in galaxy groups for the formation of luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "thanks are due to harald ebeling for the reduction of the keck spectrum , bruce fairley for the @xmath2 plot and craig collins for help with the reduction of the hri data .",
    "we acknowledge discussions with robert mann and use of the ing service observing programme on la palma .",
    "analysis was performed on the birmingham node of the uk starlink network .",
    "lrj acknowledges support of the uk pparc .",
