    "present lithographic techniques make the region of moderate to large tunneling conductance experimentally accessible @xcite .",
    "in fact when using coulomb blockade devices in thermometry @xcite or as highly sensitive electrometers @xcite , a large tunneling conductance is often desirable in view of the larger measuring signal .",
    "several theoretical advances to describe strong tunneling have been made recently .",
    "these more sophisticated theories roughly split into two groups .",
    "one may use higher order perturbation theory in the tunneling hamiltonian @xcite and , based on this , a perturbative renormalization group approach @xcite , while the other set of papers starts from a formally exact path integral expression @xcite serving as a basis for analytical calculations @xcite , monte carlo simulations @xcite , or a variational approach @xcite . despite this progress a complete theoretical understanding is still missing .",
    "in this paper we focus on the frequency dependent conductance of a single metallic tunnel junction coupled to an electromagnetic environment of arbitrary impedance , and use a path integral formulation to analytically calculate the leading order quantum corrections .",
    "the semiclassical evaluation of the path integral is justified at high temperatures and/or for large tunneling conductance and yields the frequency dependent linear conductance .",
    "so far experimental data @xcite are only available in the zero frequency limit where good agreement is found .",
    "the conductance of a tunnel junction is related to current fluctuations depending on the whole circuit . via network transformations it is always possible to transform the linear electromagnetic environment into an admittance @xmath2 in series with a tunnel junction with tunneling conductance @xmath3 and capacitance @xmath4 biased by a voltage source @xmath5 , _",

    "the general form @xmath63 is valid only to first order in @xmath57 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "a systematic treatment of higher order contributions does not allow for a description of the tunnel junction in terms of an effective linear element depending on the whole circuit .",
    "however , a partial resummation of higher order terms performed by a self consistent harmonic approximation @xcite leads again to the form @xmath63 .",
    "for further discussion of the conductance and a comparison with experimental data we now restrict ourselves to ohmic dissipation @xmath65 .",

    "the effective element behaves like a renormalized admittance with an additional capacitance in parallel and we may define a renormalized capacitance @xmath74 and a renormalized conductance @xmath75 , _",
    "cf_.  fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b . for the renormalized conductance",
