    "these highly inclined fields do not cause vertical flux to increase proportionally . since the extrapolated potential field solely depends on @xmath55 , the growth of @xmath11 lags behind .",

    "we nevertheless caution that the percentage uncertainty may be above @xmath78 for @xmath10 during the early stage of ar development , when the field is weaker and the measurement signal - to - noise ( s / n ) is lower .    to corroborate the result from the nlfff extrapolation",

    ", the _ difference _ between the pre- and post - flare @xmath10 ( @xmath137 ) , which we used as the estimate for energy loss , appears too small .",
    "one speculation is that the post - eruption coronal field is extremely dynamic and possibly deviates from the force - free condition , thus can not be well described by a static force - free snapshot . if the field is locally ( immediately above ar core ) less energetic than what the nlfff extrapolation indicates , then the discrepancy in the energy estimation will be alleviated .",
    "another speculation involves the preprocessing scheme where a certain amount of smoothing is applied to the photospheric data to ensure the force - freeness of the boundary .",
    "smoothing generally reduces the electric current inferred from the boundary , thus tending to lower the energy in the volume .",
    "coordinated chromospheric magnetic field measurement from other observatories may help to constrain this procedure .",
    "a third possibility involves the photospheric field measurement itself .",
    "small - scale field structures ( sub - arc second ) with high field gradients may carry strong electric current and a non - negligible amount of free energy , but will be unresolved with the moderate spatial resolution of hmi ( 1@xmath138 ) , and thus overlooked in the modeling result .",
    "we note that a series of comparative and diagnostic efforts pointed out the difficulties in employing realistic data input for nlfff extrapolation ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . different algorithms can produce very different energy estimations and field topologies , which mainly arises from the inconsistency between the input boundary condition and the force - free assumption ( appendix  [ a : extrapolation ] ) .",
    "we point out that the selection of the boundary data , e.g. the size of fov , the degree of flux balance , can also directly affect the quality of the extrapolation result @xcite .",
    "recent works by @xcite and @xcite included observational uncertainty in the revised algorithms .",

    "nevertheless , due to the aforementioned discrepancies , we think that quantitative energy estimations derived from modeling should be interpreted with care in the meanwhile .",
    "the rapid ( @xmath0@xmath139 ) field change at the flare time likely has a coronal driver , as the photospheric alfvn timescale is too long to be compatible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "reconnection , in particular , may change the coronal field connectivity fast enough to result in large - scale field variation at the `` line - tied '' loop footpoints .",
    "we illustrate one of the _ consequences _ in figure  [ f : reconnect ] using the nlfff extrapolation . before the flare , highly sheared field lines ( fig .",
    "[ f : reconnect]a ) cross over each other near their footpoints , creating a configuration in favor of tether - cutting reconnection .",
    "sigmoidal core loops `` are sheared past each other so that they overlap and are crossed low above the neutral line '' @xcite .",
    "these loops exchange footpoints during the reconnection , and the inner footpoints indeed appear to be well linked in the post - flare field in the nlfff extrapolation ( fig .",

    "new loops become shorter , consistent with the enhanced @xmath57 on the boundary .",
    "we note that the illustration is purely _",
    "schematic _ without any reference to the reconnection process itself .",
    "moreover , loops on the north and south sides , further away from the pil , may become connected after the flare , resulting in a more vertical configuration where @xmath57 decreases ( fig .",
    "[ f : ribbon]a ) , similar to the effect of @xmath132-spot umbral darkening reported in @xcite .",
    "this scenario has been indirectly probed through the contraction of hxr sources @xcite and the unshearing motion of euv flare ribbons @xcite .",
    "direct imaging can be difficult as euv or sxr images are usually saturated during major flares .",
    "the complicated temperature structures of the flaring atmosphere may also prevent a straightforward interpretation of the observations .    besides the short loops near the pil , tether - cutting reconnection also produces a flux - rope that connects the two far ends of the sigmoid after the exchange of the footpoints @xcite . in a detailed account of the coronal activities in this event , @xcite use mhd modeling @xcite to interpret the observations and find that the flux - rope formed by reconnection eventually erupts as part of the cme structure .",
    "interesting evidence also arises from the `` sunquake '' observation reported by @xcite following the initial report by @xcite .",
    "two distinctive photospheric seismic sources are found at the two far ends of the sigmoid and their initiations closely match the flare / cme onset time . because the signals appear before the hxr emission peak time and do not spatially match the hxr sources , they can not be explained by particle precipitation as many earlier events are .",
    "instead , flux - rope eruption appears to be the trigger , and magnetic variation is proposed as one of the possible mechanisms .",
    "the coronal fields rapidly reconstruct after the eruption and the overall effect may generate a strong downward impulse into the photosphere @xcite . nevertheless , it is pointed out that the seismic sources do not appear to be co - spatial with the strongest magnetic field or the strongest field variations @xcite .",
    "the exact excitation mechanism remains to be explained .",
    "regarding the possible ambiguity in the loop retraction observed in aia 171  ( fig .",
    "[ f : contract ] ) , we can rule out the scenario where loops remain steady but only cool sequentially into the euv temperature sensitive passband .",
    "such an explanation can not account for the sudden start and stop of the motion , or the apparent loop oscillations . to rule out the projection effect",
    ", we inspect the coronal image sequences taken by secchi euvi @xcite on the twin _ stereo _ spacecraft that are both near quadrature from the sun - earth line .",
    "coronal loops , when viewed from the side , appears to become `` flattened '' and in generally pressed down toward the solar surface during the eruption",
    ". the apparent loop length , if unchanged , should increase instead .",
    "therefore the retraction is likely to be real , its amplitude and speed underestimated from overhead aia observation .",
    "detailed analysis of euv loop motion may provide quantitative diagnostics of the coronal field ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but is out of the scope of this work .",
    "we note that the field change discussed here must be distinguished from the transient variations in the longitudinal field @xcite .",
    "the latter lasts only a couple of tens of minutes and is likely an artifact caused by flare - related emissions .",

    "a nlfff extrapolation , coupled with coronal imaging , provides information of the coronal magnetic structure , electric currents and free energy . from its early flux emergence to recurrent major flares and cme eruptions , the ar displays distinctive stages of energy build - up and release , driven by or resulting in gradual or sudden magnetic field changes .",
    "we summarize the major results as follows :    * the quadrupolar ar primarily consists of two interacting bipoles .",

    "a pronounced filament appears over the major pil early and its main part persists through multiple eruptions , including the x-2.2 class flare and halo cme on 2011 february 15 .",
    "nlfff extrapolation suggests that the field in the filament channel carries strong current , and is highly sheared with about 0.9 turn near the axis . *",
    "nlfff extrapolation indicates significant electric current and free energy injection during early flux emergence , about @xmath135 over a mere 10 h. current and energy mostly concentrate in or near the filament channel in the low atmosphere : over @xmath2 is stored below @xmath3 .",
    "the computed peak free energy reaches about @xmath140 .",
    "a @xmath137 decrease is found within 1 hour after the x - class flare .",
    "we show that the effect of random noise is small , but the systematic uncertainties can be large .",
    "the energy loss is most likely underestimated .",
    "* rapid and irreversible enhancement of the horizontal field takes place along the pil during the x - class flare .",
    "the increase in @xmath57 is @xmath5 on average ; only a @xmath95 decrease is found for @xmath94 and the signal is mixed . the observed photospheric field becomes overall stronger , more inclined and better aligned with the pil .",
    "the short time scale indicates a coronal driver .",
    "shorter loops created by tether - cutting type reconnection are _ a priori _ consistent with the photospheric signatures .",
    "the reconnection picture is supported by the fact that the change largely happens in the area that are either swept by the flare ribbons or lying in between .",
    "* nlfff extrapolation demonstrates that the change in the photospheric and coronal field is morphologically consistent with the `` magnetic implosion '' conjecture .",

    "this scenario is supported by the euv loop retractions observed from aia .",

    "the hmi vector magnetograms used in this study appear to be a good candidate .",
    "for the february 14 20:35 ut frame , the region of interest with strong field ( @xmath141 ) covers the center @xmath142 area of the fov ( a total of @xmath143 ) and is isolated from the side boundaries .",
    "there are no extended plage regions or ars nearby , and the large outskirts included correspond to a coronal volume that contains most of the observed euv loops .",
    "the net magnetic flux accounts for only @xmath144 of the total unsigned flux for the strong field region , thus the flux is well balanced .",
    "in particular , the surface integrated lorentz force and torque are 515 times lower than the several data sets used in earlier studies ( from different instruments , for different ars ) @xcite .",
    "we note that such low lorentz force / torque may be a special case , as the photospheric field is generally not expected to be force - free @xcite . for the preprocessing scheme @xcite applied before the extrapolation , we test and adopt the following parameter set : @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 . here",

    "it has been pointed out that even after preprocessing , the observed field , with its uncertainties , is still incompatible with a strictly force - free field @xcite .",
    "the fact that a better suited input does not lead to noticeable improvement in this case may suggest an internal limit to the current algorithms when dealing with realistic , imperfect boundary conditions . in light of this ,",
    "a new implementation of the optimization scheme @xcite has been developed and tested for hmi data . after including information on the horizontal field measurement uncertainties , the solution proves to satisfy the force - free condition significantly better @xcite .",
