    "one of the most remarkable understandings developed by modern astrophysics is that the very complex local universe evolved from an earlier hot phase of almost perfect uniformity .",
    "observations of the cmb reveal density fluctuations of only a few parts in @xmath0 at @xmath1 . by the time we see the distant universe of galaxies in the hubble deep field @xmath2 , these density fluctuations have developed into isolated galaxies and clusters in mostly empty space , with a whole array of shapes and sizes . *",
    "the primary goal of specs is to provide a definitive observational basis for understanding the history of and the processes that drive the development of complex structure from the homogeneous early universe . *",
    "while simple observations are sufficient to characterize simple systems , the rich complexity of this era of galaxy formation requires observations with sufficient spatial and spectral resolution to characterize the total luminosities , physical conditions , and morphological characteristics of these developing systems .",
    "+ * evolution of galaxies and structures * + * history of energy release , nucleosynthesis , and dust formation * + * feedback effects of population iii stars on those that came later * +    observations with hst , iso , keck , jcmt and other large earthbound telescopes have resulted in the identification of a large number of galaxies at redshifts out to @xmath3 , and have begun to produce a consistent picture of cosmic evolution .",
    "the optically selected samples of galaxies show a rapid increase in star formation rate , hence luminosity , as a function of redshift , peaking at about 10 times that in the local universe at @xmath4 ( madau , pozzetti & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "the far - infrared / submillimeter extragalactic background measured by the dirbe and firas instruments on cobe ( hauser  1998 ; fixsen  1998 ) requires a similarly high rate of star formation at @xmath5 ( dwek  1998 ) .",
    "conclusions regarding the earlier history of star formation are more tentative ; the star formation rate may remain near the elevated rate seen at @xmath4 , or it may decline significantly .",
    "the background measurements provide a weak constraint on the star formation at @xmath6 .",
    "ground based submillimeter observations from the scuba camera on the jcmt and measurements with isocam on iso have recently revealed high z galaxies with very high star formation rates .",
    "these galaxies are completely undistinguished in an optical survey",
    ". observations of the hubble deep field at 450 and 850 @xmath7 m suggest that optically faint galaxies undergoing massive starbursts may be responsible for 50% of the cosmic infrared background seen by firas and dirbe , and that as much as 80% of the luminosity of the early universe may be emitted in the far infrared ( hughes  1998 ) .",
    "apparently most of the nucleosynthesis and its associated energy release , the motive force behind galactic evolution , occurs in environments that in optical studies are shrouded in dust .",
    "indeed , extinction by dust is an important and ill - quantified source of systematic error in many cosmological surveys .    *",
    "thus we should strive to obtain a detailed view of the optically obscured star forming systems in the early universe ; we need the ability to measure the luminosities , redshifts , metal abundances and morphologies of galaxies back to the epoch of their formation .",
    "specs achieves this goal with sensitive submillimeter interferometry and spectroscopy . *",
    "as outlined in table  [ tbl : parameters ] , specs provides high sensitivity and hst - like angular resolution in the far infrared , a wide field of view , and spectral resolution @xmath8 . since submillimeter radiation from the early universe is faint , cryogenic telescopes with background - limited direct detectors are required .",
    "the angular scales of the relevant structures are very small , so interferometric baselines ranging up to @xmath9 km are required .",
    ".parameters of specs , submillimeter probe of the evolution of cosmic structure [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     there is also little practical experience with image reconstruction from far ir detectors and spectral - spatial interferometers like specs .",
    "simple laboratory tests should be done to wring out the problems in the analysis algorithms ; those in use at the nrao took decades of development , and although our requirements are similar , they are not identical .    we anticipate that the new generation of detectors will be some kind of superconducting device , either a superconducting transition edge ( tes ) bolometer with a multiplexed squid readout , or a superconducting junction , with photons converted to quasiparticles that can be collected and moved to the input of a single electron transistor . for the junction detectors ,",
    "the following problems need to be addressed : finding efficient devices for collecting and converting photons to quasiparticles ; transporting the quasiparticles to the amplifiers ; running the amplifiers ( current designs require rf excitation ) ; multiplexing the detectors and electronics to enable large arrays ; and building on - chip integrated circuitry .",
    "it is possible that an improved tes bolometer array will prove the best choice . in that case ,",
    "developments to anticipate include : large format arrays , on - chip readout electronics using superconducting thermometers and squid readouts , and on - chip multiplexing electronics .",
    "if a concerted effort is made to advance and test the required technologies ( table  [ tbl : techs ] ) during the next decade , it will be possible to build the specs observatory in about 15 years .",
    "a number of relevant efforts already underway ( e.g. , the ds-3 mission to test formation flying ) require sustained support .",
    "funding for efforts that require long lead times , such as advanced array detector and lightweight cryogenic optical system development , should be augmented as soon as possible .",
    "the investment needed to make the detectors a convenient and affordable reality is vital to the future of this subject .",
    "early support will also be required for specs tradeoff and design studies .",
    "a likely outcome of an evaluation of cost and risk is the recommendation to fly one or more `` precursor '' missions .",
    "the primary purpose of such missions would be to advance the technical frontiers in sensible increments toward the ultimate goal , specs .",
    "however , these missions would have potential scientific benefits as well .",
    "for example , a mission to test the detectors and cryo - coolers might conduct an unprecedented all - sky , confusion limited far ir / submillimeter survey . a dispersive spectrometer with a detector array",
    "could provide simultaneous spectra . a smaller version of the specs , say with 1 m mirrors , would still be remarkably sensitive , particularly if the photon counting detector arrays work out well and dispersive spectrometers are used to reduce the photon noise on each detector .",
    "also , the us should pursue relevant opportunities to partner with other nations .",
    "japanese ir astronomers ( matsumoto and okuda ) have expressed interest in contributions to their h2l2 mission ( see  [ sec : todaytomorrow ] ) .",
    "the us could contribute , for example , improved detectors and a scanning michelson interferometer , which could be used to conduct a deep spectroscopic survey at r @xmath10 ( i.e. , enough to reach the linewidths of typical galaxies ) .",
    "while this survey would still be confusion limited , objects at different redshifts could be distinguished by their spectral lines .",
    "any opportunity that arises to test technologies applicable to specs on a precursor mission required for ngst should also be exploited if it is deemed cost - effective .",
    "a space - based far infrared / submillimeter imaging interferometer is needed to answer some of the most fundamental cosmological questions , those concerning the development of structure in the universe (  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "such an instrument would be complementary to the already - planned next generation space telescope and the ground - based millimeter array (  [ sec : context ] ) ; it would allow access to a large number of important cooling and diagnostic spectral lines from ions , atoms , and molecules , and to the bulk of the thermal emission from dust clouds (  [ sec : physproc ] ) . in light of recent technology developments , especially the possibility of background limited photon counting detectors in the far infrared , it is now practical to consider building the interferometer (   [ sec : todaytomorrow ] and [ sec : configuration ] ) .",
    "the authors recommend that we set our sights on this goal and , over the course of the next decade , design , build and test the technology (  [ sec : technology ] ) that will be needed to deploy a submillimeter probe of the evolution of cosmic structure .",
    "the authors thank chuck bennett , alan kogut , simon radford , ramesh sinha and mark swain for helpful comments and suggestions .",
    "we are grateful for and encouraged by the warm reception our specs concept has thus far received .",
    "mh and ds acknowledge funding support from nasa through grants nag5 - 3347 and nag5 - 7154 , respectively .",
