    "main - belt asteroids ( mbas ) have continuously undergone self - collisional processes .",
    "the impact events are characterized by the target / impactor masses and collision velocity . when kinetic energy of an impactor is larger than the critical specific energy @xmath3 , the energy per unit target mass required to shatter the target and disperse half of its mass , the target is catastrophically disrupted @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the target ( largest fragment ) retains a mass larger than half of the original , resulting cratering or gravitational reaccumulation of collisional fragments after shattering .",
    "@xmath3 is an indicator of impact strength , which depends on the body size .",
    "@xmath3 decreases with increasing diameter for asteroids less than @xmath40.11  km , called ` strength - scaled regime ' . in contrast , it increases with increasing diameter for the larger asteroids , called ` gravity - scaled regime ' .",
    "the degree of change in @xmath3 with body size is the primary determinant of a power - law size distribution of the small body population in a collisional cascade .",
    "the size distribution of mbas down to sub - km size has been estimated by previous extensive surveys with ground - based telescopes such as palomar - leiden survey ( pls ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , spacewatch , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , subaru main belt asteroid survey , and sub - kilometer asteroid diameter survey ( skads ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and the survey results reported by sdss and smbas . using the observed size distributions , many studies devoted efforts for modeling the collisional evolution of mbas via numerical simulations .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath3 law is supposed to be a function only of asteroid size in each model .",
    "@xcite presented a dynamical evolution model for primordial asteroids in the early main belt that were dynamically excited due to gravitational perturbations from jupiter and embedded planetary embryos . in this phase",
    ", collisions between asteroids occurred at higher velocities than at present ( @xmath44  km  sec@xmath0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because of the pumped - up eccentricities and inclinations @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that @xmath3 law could be affected by varying collision velocities .",
    "they suggested a steeper @xmath3 curve in the gravity - scaled regime for 10  km  sec@xmath0 collisions than that for slower collisions .    the asteroid collisional evolution among impacts with much higher velocities ( i.e. @xmath5  4  km  sec@xmath0 ; hereinafter called ` hypervelocity ' ) than the mean collisions in the main belt remains unknown . because of the technical difficulties , only a few laboratory experiments for hypervelocity collisions have been conducted @xcite .",
    "the hydrocode simulations by indicated that in the gravity - scaled regime , @xmath3 for a basalt target has similar slopes between collisions of 3  km  sec@xmath0 and 5  km  sec@xmath0 , while @xmath3 for a icy target in 3  km  sec@xmath0 collisions increases with size more steeply than that in 0.5  km  sec@xmath0 collisions .",

    "they detected 178 mba candidates with 0.77  km in diameter and found that the size distribution of high - inclination mbas is shallower than that of low - inclination mbas over a wide diameter range from 0.7  km to 50  km .",
    "however , the faint - end slopes in diameter less than 2  km based on the own survey data potentially include large bias due to the non - uniform data taken at sky regions with various ecliptic latitudes and solar phase angles in uneven atmospheric conditions .",
    "actually , the power - law index of the size distribution for low - inclination mbas is inconsistent with that presented by previous studies .    in this paper , we present the results of an additional survey to determine the size distribution of high - inclination mbas down to sub - km diameter .",
    "we note that the size distribution of mbas is poorly represented by a single power law . as seen in figure  [ fig1 ] , the distribution has significant slope transitions around 3  km , 20  km , and 100  km in diameter , called ` wavy ' structure . for accurate comparison of the power - law slope between the wavy - patterned size distributions , measurements of the distribution shape in the diameter range from sub - km to several km",

    "the sdss moc objects are classified according to the following definitions : ( i ) mbas are objects with @xmath33  =  2.13.3  au .",
    "( ii ) s - like asteroids are objects with @xmath59  @xmath24  0 , and c - like asteroids are objects with @xmath59  @xmath46  0 , where @xmath59 is the color index defined by equation  ( [ eq_aast ] ) .",
    "( iii ) low - inclination asteroids are objects with @xmath34  @xmath46  15@xmath1 , and high - inclination asteroids are objects with @xmath34  @xmath24  15@xmath1 .",
    "diameter of each mba is estimated assuming @xmath56  =  0.22 for objects with @xmath59  @xmath24  0 as s - like asteroids and @xmath56  =  0.07 for objects with @xmath59  @xmath46  0 as c - like asteroids .",
    "the sdss moc seems to keep the complete detection up to @xmath7  =  21.2  mag corresponding to @xmath53  @xmath62  2.0  km @xcite . in 2.0  km",
    "@xmath46 @xmath53 @xmath46 5.0  km , the csds of sdss moc mbas have @xmath36  =  2.65  @xmath2  0.03 for the low - inclination s - like , @xmath36  =  2.17  @xmath2  0.04 for the high - inclination s - like , @xmath36  =  2.24  @xmath2  0.02 for the low - inclination c - like , and @xmath36  =  2.01  @xmath2  0.02 for the high - inclination c - like .",
    "we confirmed that high - inclination mbas have a shallower csd in either class .",
    "then , model csds were generated from a mixture of the s - like and c - like mbas with a number ratio of 1:4 in each inclination population .",
    "the estimation of csd slopes in 2.0  km @xmath46 @xmath53 @xmath46 5.0  km gives @xmath36  =  2.31  @xmath2  0.02 for the low - inclination mbas and @xmath36  =  2.04  @xmath2  0.02 for the high - inclination mbas .",
    "the difference of the slopes , @xmath82  =  @xmath36(@xmath34  @xmath46",
    "15@xmath1 )  @xmath81  @xmath36(@xmath34  @xmath24  15@xmath1 ) , is 0.27  @xmath2  0.03 , much larger than the value indicated in our survey ( @xmath82  =  0.07  @xmath2  0.04 ) .",
    "the discrepancy in @xmath82 between the two size ranges can be explained by the difference of wavy pattern in csds .",
    "we discuss the interpretations of this result in the following section .      presented an analytical model for steady - state size distributions resulting from a collisional cascade with the following two essential facts .",
    "first , the primary component of csd slope represented by a single power - law index @xmath83 is given by a simple expression of @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the power - law index of the @xmath3 law , namely @xmath3  @xmath79  @xmath86 .",
    "second , the transition of the @xmath3 law at a diameter of @xmath87  =  0.11.0  km induces the wavy structure on the mba size distribution . in the gravity - scaled regime ( @xmath53  @xmath24  @xmath87 ) , the index @xmath88 is positive , i.e. @xmath83  @xmath46  2.5 .",
    "conversely , in the strength - scaled regime ( @xmath53  @xmath46  @xmath87 ) , the index @xmath89 is negative , i.e. @xmath83  @xmath24  2.5 .",
    "the inflection in the @xmath3 law results wavelike oscillations about the csd power law with an index @xmath83 in the gravity - scaled regime .",
    "the csd shape in @xmath53  @xmath24  @xmath87 is determined by the primary slope @xmath83 as well as the phase and amplitude of the wave pattern . found that the @xmath3 law with @xmath88  @xmath90  1.40 and @xmath87  @xmath90  0.2  km reproduces the observed mba size distribution .",
    "the diameter range of csd measurements in this study is 0.75.0  km covering from the first bump down from @xmath87 .",
    "confirmed no significant difference in the peak / valley positions of the csds wavy pattern between low- and high - inclination mbas .",
    "we suggest a simple model that the csd shape varies only with @xmath83 and the wave amplitude between the two populations .",
    "the difference between a csd slope in a local size range and the primary slope , @xmath91 , is assumed to shift in proportion to wave amplitude .",
    "when the wave amplitude increases @xmath92  times , @xmath36 becomes @xmath93 .",
    "this model allows to briefly express the relationships between @xmath83 and the estimated csd slopes , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , where the suffix 1 and 2 show the diameter ranges of 0.61.0  km and 2.05.0  km , respectively , and the suffix l and h show the low- and high - inclination populations , respectively    the mbas @xmath3 law with @xmath88  =  1.40 derives @xmath83  =  2.03 using equation  ( [ eq_s2b ] ) .",
    "it corresponds to the primary csd slope of low - inclination mbas .",
    "the relational expressions of the csd indexes in this model are given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the primary csd slopes for low- and high - inclination mbas , respectively ( @xmath99  =  2.03 ) .",
    "our analysis showed the local csd slopes of @xmath94  =  1.32  @xmath2  0.02 , @xmath95  =  2.31  @xmath2  0.02 , @xmath96  =  1.25  @xmath2  0.03 , and @xmath97  =  2.04  @xmath2  0.02 .",
    "those give the solution of equation  ( [ eq_model ] ) that @xmath100  =  1.82  @xmath2  0.07 and @xmath92  =  0.80  @xmath2  0.04 .",
    "this @xmath100 value is converted into @xmath88  =  2.2  @xmath2  0.3 when equation  ( [ eq_s2b ] ) is applied .",
    "however , the collisional evolution of high - inclination mbas is dominated by collisions with low - inclination asteroids though equation  ( [ eq_model ] ) is based on collisional equilibrium in a self - contained system .",
    "numerical simulations for the collisional evolution are required to derive @xmath88 from @xmath100 .",
    "but anyway , the result in @xmath100  @xmath46  @xmath99 indicates a steep @xmath3 law in the gravity - scaled regime of high - inclination mbas .",
    "it leads to the conclusion that hypervelocity collisions on large bodies are relatively less disruptive .",
    "this may suggest that the inelasticity parameter determining the fraction of impact energy partitioned into fragment kinetic energy , generally denoted by @xmath101 , decreases with collision velocity around several km  sec@xmath0 .",
    "our results imply that the collisional evolution and the resulting size distribution of an asteroid population suffered hypervelocity collisions are not the same as those of ecliptic mbas even if the compositions and internal structures are similar to each other . in the inner region of planetesimal disk after formation of giant planets and gas dissipation , small bodies are dynamically excited and collide with each another at high velocities .",
    "@xcite showed that in the primordial main belt zone during the dynamical excitation phase caused by planetary embryos and jupiter , collisions between remnant asteroids occur at 68  km  sec@xmath0 and collisions between remnant asteroids and depleted asteroids reach more than 10  km  sec@xmath0 .",
    "the velocity - dependent @xmath3 law should be introduced for investigating the ancient size distribution and its evolution of asteroids at the final stage of planet formation processes .",
    "it allows to more precisely estimate the impact rate and size distribution of meteorites colliding with the earth and moon in the early solar system .    besides high - inclination mbas , near - earth asteroids ( neas )",
    "collide with each other at greater than 10  km  sec@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "jovian trojans with high inclinations ( @xmath34  @xmath102  20@xmath1 ) also have mean collision velocities of @xmath46  km  sec@xmath0 or higher @xcite .",
    "in addition , high - velocity collisional processes were confirmed in several planetesimal disks such as hd172555 @xcite and epsilon eridani systems @xcite .",
    "the relationship between @xmath3 law and collision velocity is required to be determined by combination of further studies with observations , numerical simulations , and laboratory experiments .",
    "it provides insight into the collisional evolution of small - body populations located in the regions close to the host star or distant from the ecliptic plane , as well as in the systems around a massive star or containing giant planets .",
    "our survey detected 441 asteroids in 13.6  deg@xmath6 at high ecliptic latitudes with a 50% limiting magnitude of @xmath7  =  24.4  mag .",
    "we obtained an unbiased sample consisting of 221 mba candidates with inclination of @xmath34  @xmath102  14@xmath1 and absolute magnitude of @xmath48  @xmath62  19.4  mag .",
    "although orbits and diameters of each asteroid can not be determined and instead are estimated with the assumption of a circular orbit and given albedo depending on radial regions , the sample yields a sufficiently quality csd to measure its slope in sub - km size .",
    "the csd for high - inclination mbas shows a roll - over at @xmath53  @xmath4  1.0  km which has also been indicated by for low - inclination mbas .",
    "the maximum likelihood analysis provided the best - fit power laws with @xmath36  =  1.25  @xmath2  0.03 in 0.6  km @xmath46 @xmath53 @xmath46 1.0  km and @xmath36  =  1.84  @xmath2  0.27 in 1.0  km @xmath46 @xmath53 @xmath46 3.0  km .",
    "most of the mba candidates are located beyond 2.6 au where showed the abundance ratio of s- and c - like asteroids is 1:4 for low - inclination sub - km mbas .",
    "the compound csd with the number ratio of 1:4 has @xmath36=1.32  @xmath2  0.02 in 0.6  km @xmath46 @xmath53 @xmath46 1.0  km , indicating that high - inclination mbas have a shallower csd in sub - km size .",
    "we furthermore examined the csds in 2.0  km @xmath46 @xmath53 @xmath46 5.0  km using the sdss moc database .",
    "the slopes are @xmath36  =  2.31  @xmath2  0.02 for low - inclination mbas and @xmath36  =  2.04  @xmath2  0.02 for high - inclination asteroids .",
    "although high - inclination mbas have shallower csds in both of the size ranges , the slope difference is larger in the larger size .",
    "this inconsistency is explained to be due to the difference of the wavy pattern on csds between low- and high - inclination populations .",
    "assuming a simple model that the both populations have the same positions of ` bump ' on the csds at a few - km diameter , high - inclination mbas have a primary csd slope of @xmath83=1.82  @xmath2  0.07 over the diameter range from 0.6  km to 5.0  km .",
    "it is definitely shallower than that of low - inclination mbas , indicating that hypervelocity collisions raises the relative strength of large bodies against catastrophic impacts .",
