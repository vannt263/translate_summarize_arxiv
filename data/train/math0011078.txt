    "the method of exhaustion was used by the ancient greeks to integrate a limited number of functions before the development of calculus [ 1 ] .",
    "it will be shown here that this ancient method can be generalized to a simple formula to integrate functions under very general conditions , assuming that the integral exists over the interval in question .",
    "the formula is    @xmath0    the proof is simple and geometric in nature , directly following the procedure originally used for the method of exhaustion .",
    "an independent algebraic proof is also provided for the special case for which a = 0 .",
    "the geometric proof is a generalization of the successive approximation method historically used to obtain the exact area under the simple curves previously integrated by this approach . consider an arbitrary function f(x ) that is piecewise continuous on [ a , b ] .",
    "the procedure to find the area under f(x ) on [ a , b ] involves successive approximations with triangles that first intersect f(x ) at the midpoint , x = a + ( b - a)/2 , and then at the new midpoints , x = a + ( b - a)/4 , x = a + 3(b - a)/4 , and so on .",
    "the first such approximation is shown in figure 1 .",
    "its area is    @xmath1    the second such approximation adds two new triangles ( figure 2 ) , each sharing two vertices with the original triangle , and each bisecting one of the remaining arcs of f(x ) at its third vertex .",
    "the two triangles have the area    @xmath2    a third such approximation ( figure 3 ) adds the area    @xmath3    each new iteration n leads to 2@xmath4 - 1 new triangles adding area a@xmath5 to further refine the area estimate .",
    "this procedure is continued indefinitely to `` exhaust '' the remaining area , leading to the formula    @xmath6    the special case for ( 5 ) when a = 0 is as follows :    @xmath7    the method of exhaustion will converge to the value of the integral at least as fast as a geometric series , because when each new triangle is small enough so that the local curvature between intersection points on f(x ) is slowly varying , it will exhaust more than 1/2 of the remaining area left from the previous approximation .",
    "there are an infinite number of possible variations on this procedure .",
    "for example , each new iteration may involve a different number of triangles to exhaust the remaining area , or each new triangle could intersect the function at a location other than the midpoint .",
    "an independent proof for ( 6 ) can be obtained starting with the identity [ 2 ]    @xmath8    this expression can be rewritten as follows : @xmath9    or    @xmath10    since @xmath11    it follows that    @xmath12 = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-b}^{b}\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty } \\gamma _ { k}x^{k}e^{-iax}dx.\\ ] ]    defining @xmath13    and noting that @xmath14 & = & b\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\sum_{m=1}^{2^{n}-1}(-1)^{m+1}2^{-n}\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty } \\gamma _ { 2k}(mb/2^{n})^{2k }   \\notag \\\\ & & \\times \\cos ( mba/2^{n } )   \\notag \\\\ & & -ib\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\sum_{m=1}^{2^{n}-1}(-1)^{m+1}2^{-n}\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty } \\gamma _ { 2k+1}(mb/2^{n})^{2k+1 }   \\notag \\\\ & & \\times \\sin ( mba/2^{n}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it follows that    @xmath15   \\notag \\\\ & & \\times \\cos ( mba/2^{n } )   \\notag \\\\ & & -ib\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\sum_{m=1}^{2^{n}-1}(-1)^{m+1}2^{-n}\\left [ g(mb/2^{n})-g(-mb/2^{n})\\right ]   \\notag \\\\ & & \\times \\sin ( mba/2^{n}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    setting @xmath16    leads to    @xmath17 .\\ ] ]    note that h(x ) can be in the form of a fourier series which sums to the following :    @xmath18    so that    @xmath7",
    "the most immediate applications are series expressions for common functions that might otherwise be very difficult to derive .",
    "some examples are presented below :    @xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25 ^{p}dx=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\sum_{m=1}^{2^{n}-1}(-1)^{m+1}2^{-n}\\left [ \\ln ( 2^{n}/m)\\right ] ^{p}. \\\\ ( 0 & \\leq & p<\\infty )   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in addition to the above expressions , this method can lead to new insights into certain physical problems .",
    "one example involves the diffraction of waves though a two - dimensional aperture in an infinite screen .",
    "this problem has been solved exactly in integral form [ 3 - 5 ] so that the field at every point depends on the fourier transform f(k@xmath26,k@xmath27 ) of the aperture at z=0 :    @xmath28    note that ( 26 ) satisfies the helmholtz equation ,    @xmath29    everywhere ( k = @xmath30/c ) as well as the boundary conditions on the screen .    under suitable conditions , the extension of ( 5 ) to convergent improper integrals can be made as follows , i.e. ,    @xmath31    equation ( 28 ) is a result of breaking the integral into a series of definite integrals on [ pb,(p+1)b ] .",
    "the result is valid when each integral @xmath32 exists and when    @xmath33 tends to a finite limit l as b@xmath34    with regard to ( 26 ) , however , it can be noted that propagating waves will only occur when the transverse wavenumber ( k@xmath35+k@xmath36)@xmath37 is lower than the cutoff wavenumber , so in the far field the integral can be evaluated to @xmath38k with good accuracy as follows ( assuming that f(k@xmath26,k@xmath27 ) is an even function with respect to both k@xmath26 and k@xmath27 ) :    @xmath39    it can be clearly seen from ( 30 ) that the resulting field is due to a summation of an infinite number of plane waves , each propagating at a different phase velocity ( and hence a different group velocity ) based on its value of k@xmath26 and k@xmath27 .",
    "thus , the process of diffraction leads to a continuous distribution of group velocities , having an amplitude distribution governed by the fourier transform of the aperture .",
    "this insight becomes particularly clear upon application of ( 5 ) to expand ( 26 ) .",
    "such a result has an effect on doppler shifts both in acoustics and in electromagnetic wave propagation , effects that are not otherwise apparent without the use of the generalized method of exhaustion .",
