    "one of the most studied , yet unresolved theoretical puzzles in modern particle physics is the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "indeed , it is widely anticipated that the lhc will provide us with crucial answers regarding the underlying nature of ewsb : is the higgs a fundamental scalar needing protection from susy or is it a composite object . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "ewsb is triggered by the higgs mechanism , which assumes a single fundamental scalar , the higgs , with a mass at the ew - scale .",
    "this leads to the long standing difficulty known as the hierarchy problem : the presence of a fundamental ew - scale seems unnatural since there is a problem of stabilizing the higgs mass against radiative corrections without introducing a cutoff to the theory at the nearby tev scale .",
    "the hierarchy problem , which is usually being interpreted as evidence for new tev - scale physics , has fueled much scientific effort in the past several decades , both in theory and in experiment .",
    "furthermore , recent flavor physics studies have revealed some degree of tension in the ckm fits for the sm with 3 generations @xcite .",
    "for example , there are indications that the `` predicted '' value of @xmath4 is larger than the value measured directly via the `` gold - plated '' @xmath5 mode by as much as @xmath6 @xcite . on the other hand , the announced cdf and do results on the cp asymmetry @xmath7 in @xmath8 ( at a higher luminosity around 6/fb ) are larger than the sm prediction by about @xmath9 @xcite , and at the same time , they find a surprisingly large cp - asymmetry in the same - sign dimuons signal , which they attribute primarily to @xmath10 - the semileptonic asymmetry in @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , perhaps the simplest variant of the sm , known as the sm4 , in which only a 4th sequential generation of fermion doublets is added to the theory ( for reviews see @xcite ) can address some of the theoretical challenges associated with the hierarchy problem @xcite and can readily account for the ckm anomalies mentioned above @xcite . in particular , as was suggested over two decades ago , a heavy 4th generation fermion may trigger dynamical ewsb @xcite . the picture that arises in this scenario",
    "is of new heavy fermions which have large yukawa couplings that are driven to a landau pole or a fixed point ( which acts as a cutoff ) , possibly at the nearby tev scale @xcite .",
    "consequently , some form of strong dynamics and/or compositeness may occur and the higgs particles are viewed as composites primarily of the 4th generation fermions ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , with condensates @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( and possibly also @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , which induce ewsb and generate a dynamical mass for the condensing fermions .",
    "as for the ckm anomalies , the two extra phases that the sm4 possesses can give rise to a host of non - standard cp asymmetries @xcite and , in addition , can significantly ameliorate the difficulties with regard to baryogenesis that the sm has @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent searches for 4th generation heavy quarks by the cdf collaboration have found that @xmath16 gev @xcite - in support of the compositeness scenario .",
    "thus , any theory that contains these heavy fermionic states is inevitably cutoff at the near by tev - scale where compositeness is expected to occur .",
    "as was realized already 20 years ago by luty @xcite , the compositeness picture which emerges in this case may be more naturally embedded at low energies in multi - higgs theories , since one should expect several composite scalars to emerge as manifestations of the different possible bound states of the fundamental heavy fermions .",
    "this idea was further studied recently in @xcite . moreover , as will be shown in this paper , the addition of more scalar doublets relaxes the constraints from precision ew data ( pewd ) ( see also @xcite ) , and allows for interesting new dynamics associated with the 4th generation fermions that can be tested at high energy colliders .    adopting this viewpoint , in section",
    "ii we construct a class of models with two scalar doublets and four generations of fermions that can serve as effective low energy frameworks and capture the key ingredients of the tev - scale compositeness picture , by giving a special status to the heavy fermionic states .",
    "we then analyze in section iii the constraints on these models from pewd and from flavor physics in b - quark systems , and in section iv we discuss some of the new distinct phenomenological consequences of our multi - higgs setup for collider searches of the 4th generation fermions .",
    "finally , in section v we summarize our findings .",
    "recall that in a type ii 2hdm ( see @xcite ) one higgs doublet couples only to the the up - quarks while the 2nd higgs doublet couples to the down - quarks .",
    "it is straight forward to extend such a setup to the case of a 4th generation fermion doublet - this was considered in @xcite and within a susy framework in @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to construct a new class of two higgs doublet models ( 2hdms ) that can serve as a viable low energy effective framework for models of 4th generation condensation .",
    "thus , in analogy with the 2hdm setup proposed in @xcite , we construct our 4g2hdms using different yukawa textures than the  standard \" 2hdm of type ii .",
    "in particular , in our",
    "4g2hdms one of the higgs fields ( call it the `` heavier '' field ) couples only to heavy fermionic states , while the second higgs field ( the `` lighter '' field ) is responsible for the mass generation of all other ( lighter ) fermions . in this way",
    ", the heavier field may be viewed as a @xmath17 composite with a condensate @xmath18 .",
    "the higgs potential is a general 2hdm one @xcite and the yukawa interaction lagrangian of the quark sector is defined as :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 are left(right)-handed fermion fields , @xmath21 is the left - handed @xmath22 quark doublet and @xmath23 are general @xmath24 yukawa matrices in flavor space .",
    "also , @xmath25 are the higgs doublets : @xmath26 @xmath27 is the identity matrix and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are diagonal @xmath24 matrices defined by @xmath30 .",
    "the yukawa texture of ( [ eq : ly ] ) can be realized in terms of a @xmath31-symmetry under which the fields transform as follows : @xmath32    one can thus construct several models in which the yukawa interactions of the heavy fermionic states have a non - trivial structure , possibly associated with the compositeness scenario .",
    "three particularly interesting models which we will study in this paper are :    * * 4g2hdm - i * : @xmath33 . in this case",
    "@xmath0 gives masses only to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , while @xmath1 generates masses for all other quarks ( including the top - quark ) .",
    "* * 4g2hdm - ii * : @xmath34 . in this case",
    "the heavy condensate @xmath0 is responsible for the mass generation of the heavy quarks states of both the 3rd and 4th generation quarks , whereas @xmath1 generates masses for the light quarks of the 1st and 2nd generations .",
    "* * 4g2hdm - iii * : @xmath35 . in this case @xmath36 , so that only quarks with masses at the ew - scale are coupled to the heavy doublet @xmath0 .",
    "the above 3 models represent , in our view , the minimal set of multi - higgs frameworks that capture the compositeness scenarios associated with the heavy 4th generation fermions .",
    "defining @xmath37 , in the 4g2hdm - i we expect @xmath38 ( @xmath39 or @xmath3 ) , while for the 4g2hdm - ii and 4g2hdm - iii models , @xmath40 seems to be a more natural choice .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the construction of our 4g2hdm models was inspired in part by the 2hdm  for the top - quark \" , which was introduced by das and kao in @xcite and which was designed to give an effective explanation for the large top - quark mass via @xmath41 .",
    "however , there is a fundamental difference between our 4g2hdms and the das and kao 2hdm : the das and kao model which was constructed with three fermion generations has no new heavy fermions ( the heavier higgs doublet , @xmath0 , couples only to the top - quark ) .",
    "thus , without the new heavy fermionic degrees of freedom , the top - quark yukawa coupling remains perturbative up to the planck scale , so that their 2hdm does not have a natural low - energy cutoff as one would expect for the condensation picture . on the other hand , in our 4g2hdms the strong yukawa couplings of the heavier higgs field to the new heavy 4th family fermions reaches a landau pole at the near by tev - scale , thus signaling new physics - possibly in the form of compositeness .",
    "alternatively , our framework might be more naturally embedded into weakly coupled theories in 5 dimensions , see e.g. , @xcite .    from the point of view of the leptonic sector , the type",
    "- i 4g2hdm is the more natural underlying setup that can effectively accommodate the heavy masses of the 4th generation neutrino @xmath42 . in particular , recall that the current bounds on @xmath43 @xcite indicate that @xmath42 should have a mass at least at the ew - scale .",
    "the main glaring problem for the sm4 is the fact that it does not address the origin of such a heavy mass for @xmath42 @xcite . on the other hand , within our 4g2hdm - i the heaviness of the 4th generation leptons ( with respect to the lighter three generations )",
    "is effectively accommodated by coupling them to the heavy higgs doublet . this setup for the leptonic sector",
    "might also be an effective underlying description of more elaborate construction in models of warped extra dimensions , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the physical higgs fields @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the lighter and heavier cp - even neutral states , respectively , and @xmath48 is the neutral cp - odd state ) are obtained by diagonalizing the neutral and charged higgs mass matrices : @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the goldstone bosons , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the mixing angle in the cp - even neutral higgs sector .",

    "i and ii @xcite , the right - handed mixing matrices @xmath67 and @xmath68 are non - physical in the sense that they are  rotated away \" in the diagonalization procedure of the quark masses . on the other hand , in our 4g2hdms some elements of these matrices",

    "we now consider constraints from pewd and from flavor physics in b - quark systems ; namely @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) mixing .",

    "the effects which do not involve direct couplings to the ordinary fermions , are analyzed by the quantum oblique corrections to the gauge - bosons 2-point functions , which can be parameterized in terms of the oblique parameters s , t and u @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , as far as the oblique parameters are concerned , the contribution from our 4g2hdms is identical at the 1-loop level to that of any 2hdm , since the new @xmath97 yukawa interactions in our models do not contribute at 1-loop to the gauge - bosons self energies .",

    "we see that in the @xmath3 case the dominance of @xmath310 ( if kinematically allowed ) is much more pronounced due to the expected smallness of the @xmath311 mixing parameter , @xmath304 , which controls the fc decay @xmath312 ; see e.g. , point 13 in table [ tab2 ] for which @xmath313 .",
    "this change in the decay pattern of the 4th generation quarks can have important consequences for collider searches of these heavy fermions .",
    "for example , as was already noticed in @xcite , if @xmath314 dominates then @xmath2 production at the lhc via @xmath315 will lead to the dramatic signature of @xmath316 .",
    "if @xmath317 ( so that @xmath46 decays to @xmath318 ) this will give a @xmath319 signature ( i.e. , after the top decays via @xmath320 ) , while if @xmath321 the @xmath316 final state can lead to either @xmath322 and/or @xmath323 .",
    "in particular , notice that the former @xmath324 is the one conventionally used for @xmath3 searches @xcite , while the latter will lead to e.g. , a @xmath325 signature which is expected to have a rather small irreducible sm - like background ( e.g. , coming from @xmath326 ) that can be further controlled using the kinematic features of the process @xmath327 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath300 dominates , then the signature @xmath328 should be focused on . in this case",
    "the @xmath2 searches will depend on the @xmath196 decays , e.g. , @xmath329 or @xmath330 , which will lead to @xmath331 or @xmath332 , respectively .    for the @xmath3",
    "the situation is similar , i.e , the new decays @xmath312 and/or @xmath310 can also alter the search strategies for @xmath3 .",
    "for example , if @xmath310 dominates the @xmath3 decays , then @xmath333 will lead to , e.g. , a @xmath334 signature as opposed to the  standard \" @xmath335 one when the @xmath3 decays via @xmath336 @xcite .",
    "clearly , these new 4th generation quark signatures deserve a detailed investigation which is beyond the scope of this paper and will be considered elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have introduced a class of 2hdms , which we named the 4g2hdm of types i , ii and iii .",
    "our models are  designed \" to give an effective low - energy description for the apparent heaviness of the 4th generation fermions and to address the possibility of dynamical ewsb which is driven by the condensates of these new heavy fermionic states .",
    "this is done by giving a special status to the 4th family fermions which are coupled to the scalar doublet that has the heavier vev .",
    "such setups give rise to very distinct yukawa textures which can have drastic implications on the phenomenology of 4th generation fermions systems .",
    "we studied the constraints from pewd and from flavor physics in b - systems and outlined the allowed parameter space of our 4g2hdms , which we find to have various different features than the simpler sm4 version with a single higgs boson and a 4th family of fermions .",
    "for example , we find that the mass splitting @xmath337 and the inverted mass splitting @xmath338 can be as large as 200 gev , and that the mass splitting in the 4th generation lepton doublet can be as large as 400 gev .",
    "we focused on the 4g2hdm - i , where the higgs doublet with the heavier vev is coupled only to the 4th generation doublet while the  lighter \" higgs doublet is coupled to all other quarks .",
    "this model is , in our view , somewhat better motivated as it provides a more natural setup in the leptonic sector , i.e. , addressing the existence of a 4th generation ew - scale neutrino .",
    "in addition , it has very distinctive features in flavor space : there are no tree - level fcnc among the 1st three generation of fermions as well as no fcnc among the 4th generation fermions and the light fermions of the 1st and 2nd generations . on the other hand ,",
    "the 4g2hdm - i does give rise to potentially large tree - level fcnc @xmath339 and @xmath247 transitions , which , as we briefly explored in the paper , can have significant implications on the search for the 4th generation quarks at high - energy colliders .",
    "for example , the fc decay @xmath314 can become the dominant @xmath2 decay channel and should therefore effect the search strategy for the @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we note that the 4g2hdm setups can also alter the production and decay patterns of the higgs particles at hadron colliders .",
    "for example , the di - photon higgs channel @xmath340 can be dramatically enhanced or suppressed ( to the level of being unobservable at the lhc ) compared to the sm4 case .",
