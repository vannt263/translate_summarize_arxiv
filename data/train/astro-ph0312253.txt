    "gravitational lensing ( for reviews , see mellier @xcite ; bartelmann & schneider @xcite ; wittman @xcite ) provides us with a unique opportunity to probe the matter distribution of the universe and , in combination with galaxy surveys , the galaxy - halo connection .",
    "in particular the small angular scale structure of the lensing shear field is sensitive to the density distribution of dark matter halos over a range of mass scales , as has been emphasized by takada & jain @xcite .    in this brief report",
    "we show , using a simple toy model , that the 3-point function of the shear is sensitive to the halo ellipticity / asphericity .",
    "this gives us another way , in principle , to measure the shapes of dark matter halos .",
    "we expect that the higher order shear correlation functions will be ever more sensitive to the asphericity of halos , thus the distribution of halo shapes , in addition to the distribution of sizes , masses and radial profiles , should be included in semi - analytic models aiming at a high fidelity prediction of the higher order shear correlations .",
    "our calculations will all be performed within the halo model paradigm ( see corray & sheth @xcite ) . specifically we assume that all the mass in the universe is contained within virialized halos with a range of sizes and shapes . under this assumption",
    "the correlation function and higher order moments of the shear can be related to integrals over the ( projected ) density profiles of the halos , times geometrical factors , and terms involving the clustering of the halos ( takada & jain @xcite ; zaldarriaga & scoccimarro @xcite ) .",
    "if we work on small ( arcminute ) angular scales then the dominant contribution to the shear 3-point function will arise when all 3 points sample the mass from within the same halo ( takada & jain @xcite ) .",
    "this term is independent of the clustering of the halos .    to describe the 3-point function we will use conventions similar to those by zaldarriaga &",
    "scoccimarro @xcite and schneider & lombardi @xcite , with @xmath1 the vector to vertex @xmath2 of the triangle with the origin of the coordinate system set to the center of the triangle and @xmath3 is the center of the halo we are considering .",
    "the geometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] .",
    "we construct scalar @xmath4-point correlation functions by contracting the three observed shears with spin-2 quantities ( mellier @xcite ; bartelmann & schneider @xcite ; wittman @xcite ; zaldarriaga & scoccimarro @xcite ) @xmath5 which have opposite parity .",
    "when we contract the above quantities with the shear components @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we will get @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "thus , we can define our three point function as @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are either + or @xmath14    the contribution to the small - angle @xmath15 from a single halo of projected density @xmath16 is then @xmath17 where the halo is centered at @xmath3 and the @xmath18 are phase factors that depends on the geometry of the halo .",
    "it has been standard in the literature to use a `` spherically averaged '' halo profile in the computation of the higher - order moments of the shear field . in this limit",
    "the shear is tangential to the halo center and the phase factors are simply @xmath19 where @xmath11 is the angle between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "however we know from numerical simulations ( frenk & white @xcite ; dubinski & carlberg @xcite ) that dark matter halos are triaxial , so we wish to relax the spherical assumption .    in order to highlight the effects of halo asphericity on the 3-point function with minimal complications",
    "we shall employ a simple toy model .",
    "first , we work entirely in terms of a single halo , we do not integrate over the entire mass distribution .",
    "second , we work throughout with projected quantities .",
    "specifically we modify the spherical ( projected ) density profile , @xmath22 , to @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are sky coordinates , possibly rotated with respect to the axes defining the shear triangle . for",
    "@xmath27 the profile is elliptical , elongated along the @xmath25 axis .",
    "meneghetti , bartelmann & moscardini @xcite found @xmath28 characterized the ellipticity of dark matter halos found in n - body simulations , and we shall use this value later as an indicator of the potential size of ellipticity effects . since our profile is now elliptical ,",
    "the phase factors , @xmath29 , become @xmath30 where @xmath12 is the angle between @xmath31 and the normal to the tangent at @xmath32 .",
    "the definitions of the variables can be easily understood from figure [ fig : geom ] .",
    "thus , for an nfw halo ( navarro , frenk & white @xcite ) , our expression for @xmath33 becomes @xmath34 where @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 are functions of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 is an integral over the orientation of the halo and @xmath16 is the projected profile which we take to be ( bartelmann @xcite ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 when @xmath43 and @xmath44 when @xmath45 .",
    "similar expressions hold for the other components of @xmath15 .",
    "it has been argued that halo ellipticity would not affect the higher order correlations of the shear , since different orientations would `` wash out '' the effect .",
    "our results show that this argument is too simplistic  the physical observables do depend on @xmath39 .",
    "one reason for this is the change in the projection of the shear at @xmath38 onto the @xmath46 and @xmath14 components .",
    "the other is simply that the orientation average of @xmath47 is nt equal to the cube of the orientation averaged @xmath48 , an inequality which becomes stronger as we go to higher orders .    since @xmath33 has the strongest signal among all of the 3-point functions , we have used it to illustrate the effect of halo asphericity .",
    "the most noticeable property of fig .",
    "[ fig:3pt ] is the peak shift and amplitude change when @xmath27",
    ". the peak first moves to the right from around @xmath49 and then moves to the left",
    ". it may be possible to see such a shift in fig .",
    "10 of takada & jain @xcite which compares the analytic theory ( assming spherical halos ) to numerical results .",
    "we can try to understand the shape of @xmath33 and the peak shift by starting from a simple case when the halo is spherical and the triangle is equilateral .",
    "let us consider the halo center to be inside the triangle , which minimizes the distances to the vertices and thus maximizes the signal , and assume that the triangle fits entirely within the halo .",
    "for @xmath50 the configuration which best matches the shear orientations to @xmath51 at each vertix can easily be seen to be an equilateral triangle . for a wide range of halo center positions one obtains a positive contribution to @xmath33 .",
    "if the halo has @xmath52 then triangles with @xmath53 have some orientations which allow more of the high density region of the halo to fall within the triangle and to better match the orientations of the @xmath46 shear components , enhancing the signal at slightly smaller angles than the @xmath50 case . for completeness",
    "we also show two of the seven other 3-point functions in figs .",
    "[ fig:3pt2 ] and [ fig:3pt3 ] . to avoid clutter we only show results for @xmath50 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "these figures show clearly that halo asphericity has an effect on all of the ( non - zero ) shear 3-point functions .",
    "we have shown in this brief report that aspherical dark matter halos give rise to a different configuration dependence of the weak lensing shear 3-point function than spherical halos .",
    "the positions and amplitudes of the peaks in the 3-point function shift as the typical halo is made more aspherical .",
    "this effect , in principle , provides us a probe of dark matter halo shapes , which have long been predicted by numerical simulations to be aspherical .",
    "it should also be included in semi - analytic models aiming at a high fidelity prediction of higher order correlations in the shear field ."
