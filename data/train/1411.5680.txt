    "<S> we study experimentally what is arguably the simplest yet non - trivial colloidal system : two - dimensional clusters of 6 spherical particles bound by depletion interactions . </S>",
    "<S> these clusters have multiple , degenerate ground states whose equilibrium distribution is determined by entropic factors , principally the symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the equilibrium rearrangements between ground states as well as all of the low - lying excited states . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the ground states , the excited states have soft modes and low symmetry , and their occupation probabilities depend on the size of the configuration space reached through internal degrees of freedom , as well as a single `` sticky parameter '' encapsulating the depth and curvature of the potential . using a geometrical model that accounts for the entropy of the soft modes and the diffusion rates along them , we accurately reproduce the measured rearrangement rates . </S>",
    "<S> the success of this model , which requires no fitting parameters or measurements of the potential , shows that the free - energy landscape of colloidal systems and the dynamics it governs can be understood geometrically .    </S>",
    "<S> colloidal clusters containing a few particles bound together by weak attractive interactions are among the simplest , non - trivial systems for investigating collective phenomena in condensed matter . </S>",
    "<S> such clusters can equilibrate on experimental time scales and display complex dynamics , yet are small enough that the ground states can be enumerated theoretically , and the positions and motions of all the particles can be measured experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical and experimental work on isolated three - dimensional ( 3d ) colloidal clusters of monodisperse particles has shown how the number of ground states changes with the number of particles @xmath0  @xcite and how the free energies of the rigid states are related to entropy - reducing symmetry effects and entropy - enhancing vibrational modes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of entropy in colloidal clusters stands in stark contrast to the case of atomic clusters , where potential energy effects dominate . </S>",
    "<S> the entropically - favored clusters are important clues to understanding nucleation barriers in bulk colloidal fluids  @xcite and the local structure of gels  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the excited states and structural rearrangements in such clusters have not yet been studied experimentally . in bulk materials , </S>",
    "<S> local structural rearrangements are important to a variety of dynamical phenomena , including the glass transition  @xcite , aging  @xcite , epitaxial growth  @xcite , and the jamming transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a better understanding of the internal dynamics in colloidal clusters could reveal local mechanisms underpinning these bulk phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> only a few experimental studies have explored internal dynamics in colloidal clusters : perry and coworkers examined transitions between two states of a 3d 6-particle cluster of spherical particles  @xcite ; yunker and coworkers studied relations between the vibrational mode structure and the contact network in disordered , two - dimensional ( 2d ) clusters of polydisperse particles as a function of @xmath0  @xcite ; and chen and coworkers examined the interconversion and aggregation pathways in clusters of particles with directional attractions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as yet , however , a quantitative understanding of the rearrangement rates and the pathways through the excited states remains challenging . </S>",
    "<S> transition - state models @xcite , which relate dynamics to the heights of saddle points on the energy landscape , are not easily applied to colloids because the fluid surrounding the particles damps and hydrodynamically couples their motions , and the short - ranged interactions typical of colloidal particles are not easily measured , making the topography of the landscape difficult to accurately compute . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as we shall show , the excited state occupation probabilities and the transition rates are sensitive to fine details of the potential , which are not easily measured .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) sds micelles induce a short - range depletion attraction between polystyrene microspheres and between the microspheres and the nearby glass coverslip . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) time - lapse images demonstrate a transition . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the three rigid ground states and their theoretical and experimental probabilities with 95% confidence intervals  @xcite ( the probabilities for the parallelogram include both chiral enantiomers ) . ]    we study experimentally the excited states and rearrangement rates in perhaps the simplest type of colloidal cluster : isostatic arrangements of equal - sized , spherical colloidal particles , constrained to lie on a plane and held together by well - controlled , short - range attractions a few times the thermal energy @xmath1 in depth ( figure  [ fig : diagram]a ) . because the clusters are isostatic </S>",
    "<S> , all excited states have zero - frequency modes , or soft modes , in their vibrational spectra ( figure  [ fig : diagram]b , @xcite ) . by tracking the particles over long times </S>",
    "<S> , we quantify the equilibrium probability of each excited state and the motions of the particles within each soft mode . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the dynamics that emerge from this landscape can be quantitatively described by a simple geometric model involving only two parameters , a `` sticky parameter '' that characterizes both the depth and curvature of the attraction , and a diffusion coefficient , which we find to be insensitive to the mode . </S>",
    "<S> both parameters can be easily measured . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , no detailed knowledge of the interactions or hydrodynamics is required to reproduce the rates of rearrangement between ground states .    </S>",
    "<S> to make clusters , we first load an aqueous suspension of 1.3 @xmath2m - diameter sulfate polystyrene microspheres into a cell made from two plasma - cleaned glass coverslips separated by 35 @xmath2 m dupont mylar^^ a spacers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the only additional component in the suspension is sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) , a surfactant that forms negatively charged micelles in solution . </S>",
    "<S> the micelles create a weak depletion interaction  @xcite between the particles and a stronger depletion interaction between the particles and coverslip  @xcite , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : diagram]a . at 33.4 mm sds </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that 2d clusters bound to a coverslip frequently transition between states but rarely split apart or merge  @xcite . at this concentration </S>",
    "<S> , the sodium counterions from the surfactant reduce the debye length to 2.85 nm , setting the effective hard - sphere depletion range of the micelles to 30 nm , just 2.3% of the particle diameter  @xcite . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic and depletion interactions between the particles are short - ranged . </S>",
    "<S> there is likely also a short - range van der waals attraction , which we estimate tapers off to @xmath1 when the particle surfaces are 145 nm apart  @xcite .    at the beginning of the experiment </S>",
    "<S> , we assemble clusters at the top of the sample cell using optical tweezers . </S>",
    "<S> we then turn off the tweezers and record digital micrographs for the remainder of the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the clusters , which would normally sediment , remain at the underside of the upper coverslip , confirming the depletion attraction . </S>",
    "<S> we use particle tracking algorithms to locate the particles  @xcite , link the locations into trajectories through time , and automatically identify the cluster configurations  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus on 6-particle clusters because this is the smallest system with multiple ground states . because these clusters are bound by short - range interactions , the potential energy is proportional to the number of contacts or `` bonds '' between particles . </S>",
    "<S> the 6-particle clusters adopt three ground states with nine bonds each ( figure  [ fig : diagram]c ) : the parallelogram ( which has two enantiomers ) , chevron , and triangle . in aggregate , the clusters occupy the parallelogram and chevron states for equal amounts of time but spend only one third as much time in the triangle state ( figure  [ fig : diagram]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the measured occupation probabilities agree with the expectation for a statistical mechanics ensemble in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> to calculate the probabilities , we assume that the translational , rotational , and vibrational degrees of freedom are independent , the vibrational modes are harmonic , and the translational contributions and potential energy differ negligibly among the 3 states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as seen previously in 3d clusters , the differences in occupation probabilities are primarily due to symmetry , which enters into the rotational contribution  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the excited states of the system have more complex and interesting structures . </S>",
    "<S> all of them have zero - frequency modes . </S>",
    "<S> the modes we see at the 8-bond energy level have either hinge - like joints or diamond - square - diamond  @xcite flexibility ( figure  [ fig : thryvexpt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the 7-bond energy level has twice as many states , nearly all of the zero - frequency modes are simply combinations of these two types of motion ( figure  [ fig : thryvexpt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the exceptions are a state with a flexible ring of five spheres and a state with a single sphere detached from the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we do not include this disconnected state in our 7-bond probability calculations because it is not a true 6-sphere cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of time the clusters spend in the excited energy levels depends on the surfactant concentration . at a concentration of 33.4 mm sds </S>",
    "<S> , the clusters spend 95.5% of the time in states with 7 or more bonds . of this time </S>",
    "<S> , 79.6% is spent in ground states , 18.0% in 8-bond excited states , and 2.4% in 7-bond excited states . </S>",
    "<S> as we decrease the surfactant concentration , the distribution shifts toward the excited energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , this shift makes sense , since decreasing surfactant concentration corresponds to decreasing depletion strength . to understand the energy level occupation probabilities quantitatively </S>",
    "<S> , we must consider the entropy of the soft modes . </S>",
    "<S> we return to this point later .    despite the wide variety of structures in the excited states , </S>",
    "<S> few have any symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the few symmetric states do not occur as infrequently as we might expect , given the dominant role symmetry  more specifically , permutational entropy  @xcite  plays in the probabilities of 6-sphere ground states in both 2d and 3d . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the asymmetric states have a highly non - uniform distribution that is only partially explained by the increased probability of states that are pairs of chiral enantiomers ( figure  [ fig : thryvexpt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these observations suggest that the variation in probabilities arises from entropic factors other than the permutational contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> .structural rearrangement rates between each of the ground states : ( p)arallelogram , ( c)hevron , and ( t)riangle . in total , we observed 820 transitions in 25.6 hours of data from 44 clusters . measured values used in postfactor : @xmath3 @xmath2m@xmath4/s ( 234 @xmath2m@xmath4/hr ) , </S>",
