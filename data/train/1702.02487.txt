    ", we show in figure  [ fig : aro_ali_obs ] the 3.3 and 3.4@xmath0 emission features of several representative astrophysical regions .",
    "the 3.4@xmath0 feature is generally thought to arise from the c ",

    "2016a for a summary ) .",
    "in recent years , the aliphatic fraction of the uie carriers  the ratio of the number of c atoms in aliphatic units ( @xmath6 ) to that in aromatic rings ( @xmath7 )  has received much attention ( e.g. , see kwok & zhang 2011 , li & draine 2012 , rouill et al .",
    "2012 , steglich et al .",
    "2013 , yang et al .",
    "2013 , 2016a , b ) .",
    "kwok & zhang ( 2011 ) argued that the material responsible for the uie features may have a substantial aliphatic component and therefore , by definition , pahs can not be the uie carrier .",
    "this argument can be tested by examining the ratio of the observed intensity of the 3.3@xmath0 feature ( @xmath11 ) to that of the 3.4@xmath0 feature ( @xmath12 ) of uie sources .",
    "if the intrinsic oscillator strengths ( per chemical bond ) of the 3.3@xmath0 aromatic c  h stretch ( @xmath1 ) and the 3.4@xmath0 aliphatic c  h stretch ( @xmath2 ) are known , one could drive the aliphatic fraction of the uie carriers from @xmath13 ( see li & draine 2012 ) . here",
    "the factor 0.3 arises from the assumption of one aliphatic c atom corresponding to 2.5 aliphatic c  h bonds ( intermediate between methylene ch@xmath14 and methyl ch@xmath15 ) and one aromatic c atom corresponding to 0.75 aromatic c  h bond ( intermediate between benzene c@xmath16h@xmath16 and coronene c@xmath17h@xmath18 ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is little experimental information on @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the uie candidate materials .",
    "therefore , one often has to rely on quantum - chemical computations based on density functional theory or second - order perturbation theory . to this end , one often uses the gaussian09 software ( frisch et al .",
    "2009 ) and employs the hybrid density functional theoretical method ( b3lyp ) in conjunction with a variety of basis sets . in the order of increasing accuracy and computational demand , the commonly adopted basis sets are ( see pople et al .",
    "1987 ) : 6 - 31g@xmath4 , 6 - 31+g@xmath4 , 6 - 311+g@xmath4 , 6 - 311g@xmath19 , 6 - 31+g@xmath19 , 6 - 31++g@xmath19 , 6 - 311+g@xmath19 , 6 - 311++g@xmath19 , 6 - 311+g(3df,3pd ) , and 6 - 311++g(3df,3pd ) .",
    "one also often employs second - order m@xmath3ller - plesset perturbation theory ( hereafter abbreviated as mp2 ) in conjunction with these basis sets . the mp2 method is thought to be more accurate in computing band intensities than b3lyp ( see cramer et al .",
    "2004 ) . indeed , as demonstrated in ",
    "[ sec : b3lyp ] , the ir intensities calculated at the b3lyp/6 - 31g@xmath4 level for the 3.3@xmath0 aromatic c  h stretches of benzene , naphthalene , anthracene , pyrene , and coronene are much higher compared to their gas - phase experimental results .",
    "this is also true for methylated species ( e.g. , methylated benzene or toluene , see  [ sec : b3lyp ] ) .",
    "using better basis sets in conjunction with the b3lyp method , we find that the ir intensities still differ by a factor of @xmath2030% compared to the experimental results .",
    "in contrast , pavlyuchko et al .",
    "( 2012 ) reported that the ir intensities calculated for benzene and toluene at the level mp2/6 - 311g(3df,3pd ) would match the experimental results very well .",
    "ideally , in order to compute @xmath1 and @xmath2 as accurately as possible , one should study the candidate uie carriers at the most pertinent levels [ e.g. , mp2 in conjunction with 6 - 311++g@xmath19 , 6 - 311+g(3df,3pd ) , or 6 - 311++g(3df,3pd ) ] .",
    "however , the huge computational demand required by these techniques often makes it impractical to compute @xmath1 and @xmath2 , particularly for large molecules . in this work , based on methylated aromatic hydrocarbon molecules ( with the methyl group taken to represent the aliphatic component of the uie carriers ) , we present in  [ sec : scaling ] an intensity scaling approach which , by scaling the intensities computed at an inexpensive level ( e.g. , b3lyp/6 - 31g@xmath4 ) we are able to obtain intensities as accurate as that computed at far more expensive levels ( e.g. , mp2/6 - 311+g(3df,3pd ) ) .",

    "the gas - phase intensity measurements of the aromatic c  h stretches have been reported for naphthalene ( @xmath2096@xmath29 ; can et al .",
    "1996 ) , anthracene ( @xmath20161@xmath29 ; can et al .",

    "to our knowledge , no gas phase ir intensities have been published for phenanthrene and perylene , although the ir absorption spectra of various matrix - isolated pah species including phenanthrene and perylene have been obtained ( e.g. , see hudgins & allamandola 1995a , b , 1997 ; hudgins & sandford 1998a , b ; szczepanski & vala 1993a , b ) .",
    "similar to benzene , the experimental intensities are much lower than our calculated results for the aromatic c  h stretches at the b3lyp/6 - 31g@xmath4 level which are respectively @xmath20139 , 178 , 188 and 257@xmath29 for naphthalene , anthracene , pyrene and coronene , exceeding their experimental values by @xmath2045% , 11% , 54% and 60% , respectively . for toluene ,",
    "we digitize the nist experimental spectra and integrate over the range of 30003200@xmath30 to obtain the intensity of the aromatic c  h stretch ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "similarly , we integrate over the range of 28003000@xmath30 to obtain the intensity of the aliphatic c  h stretch ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the relative intensity of the methyl ( aliphatic ) signal to that of the aromatic band is @xmath33 . a similar analysis of the experimental spectrum of wilmshurst & bernstein ( 1957 ) results in @xmath34 .",
    "( @xmath32 ) is the strength of all the aromatic ( aliphatic ) c  h stretches while @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is the strength of the aromatic ( aliphatic ) stretch per c  h bond . for toluene , @xmath35 and @xmath36 and",
    "therefore we have @xmath37 . ] our integration of the nist spectrum of toluene gives a total intensity of @xmath2097.2@xmath29 for all the c  h stretches ( both methyl and aromatic ) and is in excellent agreement with the value of @xmath2095@xmath29 calculated by pavlyuchko et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and by galabov et al .",
    "( 1992 ) at the mp2/6 - 311g(3df,3pd ) level .",
    "according to our ratio of the measured intensities for the methyl to aromatic regions ( @xmath33 ) , this overall intensity corresponds to intensities of @xmath2042.9@xmath29 for the methyl bands and of @xmath2054.3@xmath29 for the aromatic bands .",
    "the intensities computed at the b3lyp/6 - 31g@xmath4 level for toluene are @xmath20165.3@xmath29 for the entire region and @xmath2070.4 and @xmath2094.9@xmath29 for the methyl and aromatic sections , respectively .",
    "again , we see that the computed intensities are much higher than the experimental values from the gas phase measurements .    in the absence of absolute intensity experimental data for naphthalene , anthracene , phenanthrene , perylene , pyrene and coronene , we are unfortunately not able to compare the experimental intensities of the c  h stretches of these molecules with that computed at the b3lyp/6 - 31g@xmath4 level .",
    "as we have seen in  [ sec : b3lyp ] , the ir intensities calculated at the b3lyp/6 - 31g@xmath4 level are much higher compared to the experimental results . using better basis sets in conjunction with the b3lyp method , we found that the ir intensities still differ by a factor of @xmath2030% compared to the experiment results .",
    "pavlyuchko et al .",
    "( 2012 ) reported that the ir intensities calculated for benzene and toluene at the level mp2/6 - 311g(3df,3pd ) would match the experimental results very well .",
    "we have tried to reproduce their data for benzene and toluene by performing both mp2(fc ) and mp2(full ) computations with the 6 - 311g(3df,3pd ) basis set.53@xmath29 and @xmath2098@xmath29 , respectively .",
    "we have tried both mp2(fc)/6 - 311g(3df,3pd ) and mp2(full)/6 - 311g(3df,3pd ) . with mp2(fc)/6 - 311g(3df,3pd ) , we obtained @xmath2053.8@xmath29 and @xmath2097.1@xmath29 for benzene and toluene , respectively , while with mp2(full)/6 - 311g(3df,3pd ) these intensities become @xmath2052.4@xmath29 and @xmath2094.7@xmath29 .",
    "although the mp2(fc ) results closely match that of pavlyuchko et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , the mp2(full ) results are closer to the experimental results ( @xmath2055@xmath29 for benzene and @xmath2095@xmath29 for toluene ) . since mp2(full ) considers all the core and valence electrons and thus should be more accurate than mp2(fc ) , we therefore calculate all other vibrational spectra with mp2(full ) in conjunction with the standard basis set 6 - 31g@xmath4 and the extended basis sets 6 - 311+g@xmath19 and 6 - 311+g(3df,3pd ) for benzene , naphthalene and their mono - methyl derivatives as test cases . ]    while the mp2(full)/6 - 311+g(3df,3pd ) level data reproduce the measured ir intensities reasonably well , such calculations are far too expensive especially for large molecules .",
    "the mp2(full ) computations of the naphthalene systems with the large basis sets including the ( 3df,3pd ) polarization functions each requires several days of computer time on eight processors .",
    "considering that the absolute values computed at all of the mp2 levels are better than the respective values computed at the b3lyp levels , one would be inclined to explore scaling approaches of the mp2 data computed with modest basis sets .",
    "however , we will show below that scaling approaches that are based on the b3lyp data can be just as successful in spite of the fact that the absolute numbers computed at the b3lyp/6 - 31g@xmath4 level differ much more from experiment than do the mp2/6 - 31g@xmath4 data .",
    "before we proceed , it is useful to clarify the meaning of scaling approaches . in the most typical approach to scaling , it is attempted to reproduce a set of experimental data with a set of data obtained at a level @xmath38 such that @xmath39 , that is , one scaling factor @xmath40 is applied to all values in the data set and this scale factor depends on the level , @xmath41 . this kind of scaling is commonly employed for vibrational frequencies . for intensities ,",
    "however , we will see that approaches of the type @xmath42 are more successful , that is , there will be a non - zero offset .",
    "let @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively represent the mp2(full ) computations with the 6 - 31g@xmath4 , 6 - 311+g(d , p ) , and 6 - 311+g(3df,3pd ) basis sets .",
    "let @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively represent the b3lyp computations with the 6 - 31g@xmath4 , 6 - 311+g(d , p ) , and 6 - 311+g(3df,3pd ) basis sets .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : int_leveldep ] ( top left ) , the total intensities ( @xmath49 ) computed at the mp2 level but with different basis sets [ i.e. , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are linearly related :    [ eq : mp2_ls_ssms ] @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the linear - correlation coefficient . while eq.[eq : mp2_ls_ms ] describes an excellent linear correlation between the intensities computed with the @xmath45 method and that with the @xmath44 method without any need for an offset , the analogous eq.[eq : mp2_ls_ss_a ] is less successful and an excellent linear correlation between @xmath55 and @xmath50 only is achieved when a non - zero offset is allowed in eq.[eq : mp2_ls_ss_b ] .",
    "the analogous relations also hold at the b3lyp level ( eq.[eq : b3lyp_ls_ss ] ) and they are shown in figure  [ fig : int_leveldep ] ( top right ) , where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are respectively the intensities computed at the @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 levels .",
    "[ eq : b3lyp_ls_ss ] @xmath59    also shown in figure  [ fig : int_leveldep ] ( bottom left ) are the nearly linear relations between the ir intensities computed at the b3lyp and mp2(full ) levels with a common basis set .",
    "the data are very well described by linear regression and there is no need for a non - zero offset in any of the following equations ( see eqs.[eq : b3lyp_mp2_ss ] , [ eq : b3lyp_mp2_ms ] , and [ eq : b3lyp_mp2_ls ] ) .",
    "it is remarkable that these slopes are rather similar for the various basis sets .",
    "[ eq : b3lyp_mp2_scale ] @xmath60    in light of these linear correlations , it is clear that there must be a strong linear correlation between the lowest dft level , our standard level b3lyp/6 - 31g@xmath61 ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) , and the best mp2 level , the level mp2(full)/6 - 311+g(3df,3pd ) ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) . eqs.[eq : mp2_ls_ss_a ] and [ eq : b3lyp_mp2_ss ] suggest a correlation coefficient of @xmath62 and the actual correlation coefficient of eq.[eq : b3lyp_mp2_a ] is @xmath200.5152 and it is essentially the same ( see figure  [ fig : int_leveldep ] , bottom right ) . considering the need for non - zero offset in eq.[eq : mp2_ls_ss_b ] , we also explore eq.[eq : b3lyp_mp2_b ] and achieve an excellent linear correlation :    [ eq : b3lyp_mp2 ] @xmath63    this tells that , by applying this scaling relation ( eq.[eq : b3lyp_mp2_b ] ) , we just need to perform computations at an inexpensive level ( e.g. , b3lyp/6 - 31g@xmath4 ) and we are still able to obtain intensities as accurate as that computed at far more advanced levels [ e.g. , mp2/6 - 311+g(3df,3pd ) ] .",
    "as shown in yang et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the aromatic c  h stretch band strength does not vary significantly for different molecules .",
    "it has an average value ( per aromatic c  h bond ) of @xmath64 , with a standard deviation of @xmath65 . on the other hand , the aliphatic c",
    " h stretch band strength is more dependent on the nature of the molecule and also on the specific isomer .",
    "the average band strength ( per aliphatic c  h bond ) is @xmath66 , and the standard deviation is @xmath67 .",
    "all of these values are calculated for neutral pahs at the b3lyp/6 - 311+g@xmath19 ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) level . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : scaling ] , these values need to be scaled . by taking mp2(full)/6 - 311+g(3df,3pd ) ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) to be the level which gives the most reliable band strength , the intensities need to be scaled with two formulae : eqs.[eq : mp2_ls_ms ] and [ eq : b3lyp_mp2_ms ] .",
    "thus , we derive for neutral pahs @xmath68 ( i.e. , @xmath20@xmath69 per c  h bond ) , @xmath70 ( i.e. , @xmath20@xmath71 per c  h bond ) , and @xmath72 . similarly , we obtain for pah cations @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",

    "lets consider a pah molecule containing @xmath7 aromatic c atoms and @xmath6 aliphatic c atoms ( i.e. , @xmath6 methyl sidegroups ) .",
    "we approximate their absorption cross sections by adding three drude functions to that of pahs of @xmath88 aromatic c atoms , with these drude functions respectively representing the 3.4@xmath0 aliphatic c  h stretch , and the 6.85 and 7.25@xmath0 aliphatic c  h deformations : @xmath89 where @xmath90 ; @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 are respectively the peak wavelengths of the 3.4 , 6.85 and 7.25@xmath0 features ; @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 are respectively the mean fwhms of the astronomical 3.4 , 6.85 and 7.25@xmath0 features ( yang et al .  2003 , 2016a ) , , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are dimentionless parameters . ] and @xmath99 and @xmath100 are respectively the integrated strengths per ( aromatic ) c atom of the 3.3@xmath0 aromatic c  h stretch and 6.2@xmath0 aromatic c  c stretch ( see draine & li 2007 ) . due to their small size ( and therefore small heat capacity ) , pahs are heated sporadically by single starlight photons . unless exposed to an extremely intense radiation field , pahs will undergo strong temperature fluctuations and will not attain an equilibrium temperature ( see li 2004 ) .",
    "we take the `` thermal - discrete '' technique developed by draine & li ( 2001 ) to calculate the temperature probability distribution functions and the resulting emission spectra of methyl pahs .",

    "this is because the intrinsic strength of the 7.25@xmath0 feature is weaker than that of the 6.85@xmath0 feature by a factor of @xmath208 for neutral methyl pahs and by a factor of @xmath203 for their cations ( yang et al .",
    "2016a ) . in the following discussions ,",
    "we will focus on the 3.3 and 3.4@xmath0 features since the molecules considered here are too small to be the dominant uie emitters at @xmath2068@xmath0 ( see figures  6 , 7 of draine & li 2007 ) .",

    "[ fig : iratio_u ] we show the model intensity ratios @xmath118 as a function of @xmath122 for neutral and ionized methyl pahs .",
    "it is encouraging to see in figure  [ fig : iratio_u ] that , with @xmath123 , @xmath118 reaches @xmath200.9 for neutrals and @xmath202.0 for cations , demonstrating that the unusually high @xmath8 ratios observed in some protoplanetary nebulae ( e.g. , iras  04296 + 3429 with @xmath124 ) can be accounted for by a mixture of neutral and ionized methyl pahs , with a reasonable fraction of c atoms in methyl sidegroups . in figure",
    "[ fig : iratio_u ] we also compare the model band ratios with the ratios computed from the simple relation @xmath125 for neutrals or @xmath126 for cations .",
    "figure  [ fig : iratio_u ] shows that this simple , straightforward relation does an excellent job in accurately predicting @xmath118 .",
    "this is nice because in future studies one can simply use this convenient relation to determine the aliphatic fraction @xmath122 of the uie carrier from the observed band ratio @xmath8 : @xmath9 for neutrals and @xmath10 for cations .",
    "there is no need to compute the temperature probability distribution functions and the ir emission spectra of methyl pahs as long as one is only interested in the aliphatic fraction of the uie carrier .",
    "so far , we have only considered methyl pahs excited by the mmp83-type starlight . to examine",
    "whether and how the spectral shape of the exciting starlight affects the model ir emission spectra and the band ratios @xmath118 , we consider methyl pahs of @xmath127 aliphatic c atoms and @xmath128 aromatic c atoms excited by stars with an effective temperature of @xmath129 like our sun and by stars of @xmath130 like the b1.5v star hd37903 which illuminates the reflection nebula ngc2023 .",
    "we fix the starlight intensity in the 912@xmath1311@xmath0 wavelength range to be that of the mmp83 isrf ( i.e. , @xmath132 ) : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the intensity of starlight approximated by the kurucz model atmospheric spectrum , and @xmath135 is the mmp83 isrf starlight intensity .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : modspec_t ] , for a given @xmath122 , the @xmath129 model results in a lower emissivity level than that of the mmp83 isrf model .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath130 model results in a higher emissivity level than that of the mmp83 isrf model . this is because , exposed to a _",
    "softer _ radiation field , pahs absorb individual photons with a _",
    "lower _ mean energy than that of a _ harder _ radiation field and therefore emit less ( because they absorb less ) . nevertheless , the emission spectral profiles are very similar to each other .",
    "this is also illustrated in figure  [ fig : iratio_t ] which shows that the model band ratios @xmath118 differ very little for methyl pahs excited by starlight of different spectral shapes .",
    "so far , we have confined ourselves to coronene - like pahs with @xmath136 . to examine the effects of the pah size on the model ir emission spectra and the band ratios @xmath118",
    ", we consider methyl pahs of @xmath137 aromatic c atoms ( like perylene ) and @xmath127 aliphatic c atoms , as well as methyl pahs of @xmath138 aromatic c atoms ( like ovalene ) and @xmath139 aliphatic c atoms .",
    "c  h feature is predominantly emitted by small neutral pahs of @xmath202030 c atoms ( see figures  6,7 of draine & li 2007 ) . ] as shown in figures  [ fig : modspec_nc],[fig : iratio_nc ] , neither the ir emission spectra in the c  h stretch region nor the band ratios @xmath118 appreciably differ from each other .",
    "finally , we compare in figure  [ fig : iratio_mod ] the band ratios @xmath8 observed in the eight representative astrophysical environments shown in figure  [ fig : aro_ali_obs ] with that calculated from methyl pahs .",
    "it is seen that the observed band ratios @xmath8 of all sources except the protoplanetary nebula iras  04296 + 3429 all fall below the model @xmath118 curve of neutral pahs with @xmath136 and @xmath140 . for iras  04296 + 3429",
    ", the unusually high ratio of @xmath124 falls below the model @xmath118 curve of pah cations .",
    "this demonstrates that a mixture of neutral and ionized methyl pahs are capable of accounting for all the observed band ratios , including those of protoplanetary nebulae some of which exhibit an extremely strong 3.4@xmath0 feature .",
    "we have presented an intensity scaling scheme for scaling the band strengths of the c ",
    "h stretching features of pahs with a methyl side chain computed with b3lyp which is less accurate and computationally less demanding .",
    "such an intensity scaling approach allows us to obtain accurate band strengths , as accurate as that computed with mp2 in conjunction with large basis sets which is known to be more accurate than b3lyp but computationally very expensive .",
    "it is found that the band intensities calculated with b3lyp/6 - 31g@xmath4 for a number of molecules are much higher than their gas - phase experimental values .",
    "using better basis sets in conjunction with the b3lyp method , the computed intensities are still considerably higher ( by @xmath2030% ) compared to their experimental results . the mp2 method with the basis set of 6 - 311+g(3df,3pd ) reproduces the measured intensities reasonably well",
    ". however , such calculations are far too expensive especially for large molecules .",
    "it is shown that intensity scaling approaches that are based on the b3lyp data can be just as successful .",
    "we have also calculated the model spectra of methylated pahs and their cations of different sizes and various numbers of methyl sidegroups , excited by starlight of different spectral shapes and intensities .",
    "we find that the ratio of the model intensity of the 3.4@xmath0 feature to that of the 3.3@xmath0 feature is insensitive to the pah size and the spectral shape and intensity of the exciting starlight .",
    "we have derived a simple , convenient , and straightforward relation for determining the aliphatic fraction @xmath122 of the 3.3@xmath0-band carriers from the observed band ratios @xmath8 : @xmath9 for neutrals and @xmath10 for cations .",
    "we show here that the non - zero offset in the intensity scaling relation ( see  [ sec : scaling ] ) comes from the fact that the intensities of methyl ( aliphatic ) and aromatic c  h stretches do not scale alike ( i.e. , @xmath141 ) .",
