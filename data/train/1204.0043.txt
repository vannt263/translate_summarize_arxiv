    "the diverse class of type  iin supernovae ( sne ) provides some of our most puzzling clues about the immediate pre - sn evolution of massive stars .",
    "sne  iin are known for their namesake narrow and intermediate - width hydrogen emission lines that usually dominate the spectrum ( see filippenko 1997 for a review of sn spectral types ) , and which arise from the forward shock of the sn interacting with dense circumstellar material ( csm ) .",
    "the very dense and massive csm around some of the most luminous sne requires massive episodic shell ejections shortly before core collapse ( see , e.g. , chugai et al.2004 ; woosley et al .  2007 ;",
    "smith et al .  2008a , 2010 ; van marle et al .",
    "2010 ) , the physical parameters of which most closely resemble the giant eruptions of luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) like @xmath2 carinae ( smith & owocki 2006 ; smith et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "although the idea that stars in the lbv phase could undergo core collapse was not expected from stellar evolution models , the lbv / sn  iin connection inferred from properties of the csm is reinforced by the detection of luminous lbv - like progenitors of three sne  iin ( gal - yam & leonard 2009 ; smith et al .",
    "2011a , b ; kochanek et al .",
    "the core - collapse explosion of lbvs violates expectations of standard stellar evolution models , where massive stars are supposed to undergo only a very brief ( 10@xmath310@xmath4 yr ) transitional lbv phase , and then spend 0.51 myr in the core - he burning wolf - rayet ( wr ) phase before finally exploding as normal sne  ibc ( meynet et al .",
    "1994 ; heger et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this paper",
    "we discuss a sn whose progenitor star suffered core collapse while apparently still in the transition from an lbv to a wr star .",
    "combined with the lbv - like progenitors of sne  iin , this underscores the notion that stellar evolution models are missing essential aspects of the end stages of massive stars .",
    "an interesting extension of the type  iin phenomenon was most dramatically illustrated by sn  2006jc ( foley et al .  2007 ; pastorello et al .  2007 ;",
    "smith et al .",
    "2008b ) , which exhibited spectral signatures of strong csm interaction .",
    "spectra of sn  2006jc had relatively narrow lines similar to those of sne  iin , but seen mainly in he  i emission lines  there was only a trace amount of h in the spectrum .",
    "it is therefore referred to as a `` type ibn '' event or a peculiar type  ib , instead of a type  iin .",
    "sn  2006jc has been studied in detail over a wide range of wavelengths ( foley et al .  2007 ;",
    "pastorello et al .",

    "2009 ; chugai 2009 ) .",
    "it has important implications for understanding the broader class of sne  iin and ibn with csm interaction , because so far it is the only object that was actually observed to have a non - terminal lbv - like outburst just 2 yr prior to explosion ( itagaki et al .",
    "2006 ; pastorello et al .",
    "prior to the example of sn  2006jc , lbv - like eruptions were not known to occur in h - poor / he - rich stars . in particular , the very short timescale of only 2 yr confirms conjectures from studies of sne  iin that episodic bursts of mass loss ( rather than steady winds ) can occur immediately before core collapse .",
    "if the eruptive events that cause sne  iin and ibn are indeed synchronised with core collapse , this may provide clues to the nature of the underlying mechanism ( see , e.g. , woosley et al .",
    "2007 ; quataert & shiode 2012 ) .    while type  iin explosions make up 89% of all core - collapse sne in the lick observatory supernova search sample ( smith et al .  2011c ; li et al .  2011 ) , the type  ibn events like sn  2006jc represent a substantially smaller fraction .",
    "the `` peculiar '' type  ibc supernovae , which constitute 4% of the same sample , included some examples of sn  2006jc - like objects but also had other unusual objects , so the fraction of sn  2006jc - like events is likely to be around 1% or less of all core - collapse sne .",
    "this agrees with an independent estimate of the fraction of sn  ibn events by pastorello et al .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "given their rare occurrance , additional examples are valuable to demonstrate the diversity of the subclass . other suggested members of the type  ibn subclass are sn  2002ao , sn  1999cq , and sn  2000er ( matheson et al .",

    "2011 ) obtained the first spectrum and noted the narrow he  i emission lines .",
    "they suggested a similarity to the transitional sn  iin / ibn 2005la ( pastorello et al .",
    "while both sn  2011hw and sn  2005la do exhibit strong he  i emission lines , our spectral comparison below suggests that sn  2011hw is much more closely related to sn  2006jc , with only a small increase in the amount of h present in the csm .",
    "we suggest that the similarities and differences between sn  2011hw and sn  2006jc can be understood if their progenitors were at different points in the transitional evolution from an lbv to a wr star when they exploded .",
    "following the discovery of sn  2011hw , we obtained @xmath6 , @xmath1 , and @xmath5-band photometry using the 1  m nickel telescope at lick observatory .",
    "the background emission of the rather compact host galaxy was problematic for simple aperture photometry .",
    "this was particularly true for images obtained under relatively poor seeing conditions , when the galaxy nucleus and sn image began to partially overlap , and for the late - time epochs when the sn became faint .",
    "thus , we employed the idl starfinder code to perform point - spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry to extract the sn flux . for each epoch , a psf model was constructed using 5 suitably bright , isolated field stars .",
    "the sn was automatically recovered by the starfinder code in all epochs and the galaxy was modeled as local background .",
    "the photometric zero point was derived from the usno-@xmath6 photometry of the psf stars and two fainter field stars ( after converting the magnitude values to the johnson system ) .",
    "the photometric uncertainties were taken as the standard deviation of the sn magnitude values derived by comparison with each of the individual calibration stars .",

    "1995 ) mounted on the keck  i 10  m telescope , and the bluechannel spectrograph on the multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) .",
    "the spectra were generally obtained at low airmass or with an atmospheric dispersion corrector ; otherwise , the parallactic angle ( filippenko 1982 ) was used to minimise chromatic differential slit losses .",
    "our data reduction followed standard techniques as described by silverman et al .",
    "our spectroscopic observations are summarised in table  [ tab : spectab ] , and an overview of the spectra is shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "most of the data had moderate resolution ( @xmath9 and 1400 for red and blue sides of the kast spectra , respectively ) and covered a large wavelength range , but we also obtained a few epochs with higher resolution ( @xmath10 and 4500 with keck / lris and mmt / bluechannel , respectively ) .",
    "these higher resolution spectra are particularly interesting with regard to the narrow lines from slow circumstellar gas , as discussed below .",
    "we display the high - resolution day 47 mmt spectrum in figure  [ fig : hires ] .",
    "one can detect absorption from the na   i  d doublet at the velocity of sn  2011hw , seen as an absorption notch on the red wing of the he  i @xmath115876 profile .",
    "this is not necessarily interstellar - medium absorption that can be associated with dust , however , since these absorption lines are weaker or absent in some of our earlier spectra , and there appear to be na  i d emission components as well ( figures  [ fig : spec ] and [ fig : hires ] ) .",
    "the resulting p cygni profile suggests tht the na  i d is circumstellar , rather than interstellar .",
    "this and the very blue colour of sn  2011hw are why we do not assume any additional local reddening and extinction in our analysis below , although it is difficult to rule out the presence of some additional local dust that may not be traced by na  i d absorption .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the host of sn  2011hw is an anonymous galaxy with an unknown distance . in our spectra",
    ", we measure a redshift of @xmath12 from the narrow - line components in sn  2011hw , which implies a distance @xmath13 mpc ( assuming h@xmath14 = 73 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt @xmath18 mag ( schlegel et al.1998 ) for the value of the line - of - sight galactic reddening ( all spectra are corrected for this value ) .",
    "we do not adopt any additional local extinction , although we can not rule out the presence of dust that may be local to sn  2011hw . with these parameters ,",
    "the peak apparent unfiltered magnitude of @xmath19 at the time of discovery corresponds to a peak absolute unfiltered ( approximately @xmath1-band ) magnitude of @xmath019.5 .",
    "this is about 1.5 mag more luminous than sn  2006jc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phot ] ; see foley et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the luminosity evolution between discovery and the start of our photometric monitoring is unclear .",
    "sn  2011hw appears to have declined quickly from its initial peak , but then leveled off with a plateau or secondary peak at 2030 days in our photometry , with an absolute @xmath1 magnitude of about @xmath018.3 .",
    "thereafter , sn  2011hw faded at a relatively constant rate of @xmath20 mag d@xmath15 in the @xmath1 band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phot ] ) , slower than the @xmath21 mag d@xmath15 @xmath1-band decline rate of sn  2006jc before it reached its radioactive decay tail .",
    "our photometry ends at about day 60 , so we do not have a reliable estimate of the @xmath22co radioactive decay - tail luminosity .",
    "this does not provide a useful upper limit to the mass of @xmath22ni , since much of the luminosity even at this late phase might be dominated by csm interaction .",
    "a possible explanation of the early light curve is that the secondary peak might be additional luminosity from csm interaction if the shock overran a denser portion of its csm shell , as seen in the late turn - on of sn  2008iy ( miller et al .",
    "2010 ) , although sn  2011hw would be a far less extreme case of this . in figure",
    "[ fig : phot ] we show that the light curve of sn  2011hw has a luminosity and decline rate similar to those of the well - studied sn  iin 1998s ( fassia et al .",
    "2000 ) , in which csm interaction with a dense shell was prominent .",
    "pastorello et al .",
    "( 2008a ) infer that sne  ibn fade quickly because they do not have substantial luminosity from csm interaction . from sn  2011hw",
    ", we conjecture that this fast fading of other sne  ibn may be the result of very low h abundance , with the lower opacity allowing more of their csm interaction luminosity to escape at shorter wavelengths . on the other hand , with substantial h opacity ,",
    "sne  iin have characteristic emitting temperatures around 6000  k and emit much of their csm - interaction luminosity at visual wavelengths .",
    "uv spectroscopy of future examples of sne  ibn could therefore be quite interesting , to test if their lower h abundance allows much of the csm interaction luminosity to escape in the uv .",
    "the @xmath7 colour curve of sn  2011hw is similar to that of sn  2006jc , but is more constant with time , and both are significantly bluer than the colour curve of a normal sn  ii - p represented by sn  1999em or of a sn  iin like sn  1998s ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phot ] ) .",
    "the colour of sn  2011hw is in fact remarkably constant during the time period over which we observed it , rising slowly by only @xmath23 mag , from roughly 0.1 to 0.2 mag in @xmath7 over @xmath24 days .",
    "the blue colour is dominated by the blue / near - uv excess that closely resembles the shape of the spectrum in sn  2006jc ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "a similar excess was seen in the sn  iin 2005ip , where the narrower lines showed that the blue / near - uv `` continuum '' bump may be due to a blend of many emission lines formed in the csm or in the post - shock gas ( smith et al .  2009 ) .    in a normal sn",
    "ii - p or sn  iin , the redder colour is determined by the @xmath25  k continuum that arises from the h - recombination photosphere . in sn  2011hw and sn  2006jc , we suspect that the prominence of the blue bump is due to the lower continuum opacity that follows from the lower h abundance . in cases like sn  2005ip where h@xmath26 is extremely strong",

    "data for sn  2006jc are from smith et al .",
    "( 2008b).,width=326 ]      overall , one can see from figure  [ fig : spec ] that the character of the spectrum changed very little as sn  2011hw faded by almost 2 mag .",
    "notable features of the spectrum are the broad blue / near - uv bump in the continuum ( or pseudo continuum ) , the moderately strong narrow emission lines of he  i and h@xmath26 , and a large number of weaker narrow ( few 10@xmath27 km s@xmath15 ) and intermediate - width ( few 10@xmath28 km s@xmath15 ) emission lines throughout the spectrum .",
    "the continuum shape and relative strength of he  i and h lines remained largely constant .",
    "one systematic change in our spectra is that as sn  2011hw fades during the first 60 days , we see a gradual increase in the relative strength of several narrow and intermediate - width lines ( figure  [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "a number of narrow lines that are not present in our first spectrum on day 7 gradually gain in strength at later times .",
    "figure  [ fig : hires ] displays a comparison of our high - resolution day 47 spectrum of sn  2011hw and a similar spectrum of sn  2005ip , which reveals that a number of these same narrow lines are high - ionization coronal lines . while the two spectra have important differences ( especially in h@xmath26 ) , one can see that several of the same lines are present in both objects , including lines of [ fe   iv ] , [ fe  v ] , [ fe  vi ] , [ fe  vii ] , [ fe  x ] , [ ar  x ] , etc . as noted by smith et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , many of these lines are commonly seen in active galactic nuclei as well .",
    "this indicates that as in sn  2005ip , a substantial fraction of x - rays from the post - shock region are able to penetrate well ahead of the shock into the csm . this may be due either to the lower h opacity , clumping , or both ( see smith et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lines ] displays the evolution with time of the measured he  i and h@xmath26 emission - line strengths in sn  2011hw , as compared to the same lines in sn  2006jc ( smith et al.2008b ) . in general , the observed behaviour is remarkably similar in the two sne .",
    "the line flux of h@xmath26 in the two sne is nearly identical , whereas the he  i lines are a factor of 510 weaker in sn  2011hw .",
    "this is probably due to a combination of a lower he / h abundance ratio in sn  2011hw , as well as a radiative transfer effect wherein a corresponding increase in the h opacity may absorb much of the harder radiation needed to excite the he  i lines .    aside from this",
    "relatively weaker he  i emission in sn  2011hw , the evolution in time of the strength of he  i emission lines ( figure  [ fig : lines]a ) is very similar in sn  2011hw and sn  2006jc .",
    "moreover , the evolution in time of the line ratios of he  i @xmath117065/@xmath115876 and @xmath116678/@xmath115876 ( figure  [ fig : lines]b ) is nearly identical for both sne .",
    "the he  i @xmath117065/@xmath115876 ratio is particularly interesting , as ratios rising from @xmath29 at early times to @xmath30 at later times indicate very high electron densities approaching @xmath31 @xmath32 in the post - shock shell ( almog & netzer 1989 ) . densities near 10@xmath33 @xmath32 represent a critical value for the nucleation of dust ( e.g. , clayton 1979 ) , providing that the gas can cool sufficiently . in the case of sn  2006jc , these very high densities were accompanied by the copious formation of dust grains in the post - shock shell , indicated by a simultaneous rising near - ir excess from hot dust , increased optical extinction , and a systematic blueshift of emission - line profiles ( smith et al .",
    "although we lack ir photometry to check for this effect in sn  2011hw , we do not yet see the systematic blueshift of line profiles in sn  2011hw ( see figure  [ fig : vel ] ) that would be considered evidence of new dust forming in the post - shock region .",
    "the reason for the difference may be that at times around day 50 after explosion ( when the density apparently climbs to the critical value for dust formation in both sne ) , sn  2011hw was about 10 times more luminous than sn  2006jc at the same epoch . therefore , while the carbon - rich gas was able to condense to grains with a temperature of 1700 k in sn  2006jc ( smith et al .",
    "2008b ) , the equilibrium temperature was probably still too high in the case of sn  2011hw due to its higher luminosity .",
    "if the density remains high enough for grains to form , the temperature should become low enough for this to occur at around day 90100 , assuming that sn  2011hw continues to fade at the same rate . because the position of sn  2011hw became too close to the sun",
    ", we could not continue obtaining spectra after day 63 ; it will be interesting to see if the emission - line profiles become asymmetric when sn  2011hw is observable again .",
    "we note that in the case of sn  2005ip , which also showed evidence for dust formation despite its high - excitation spectrum , the ir excess and line - profile evidence of dust appeared when the sn faded from its main luminosity peak ( see smith et al .  2009 ; fox et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : vel ] shows moderately high - resolution line profiles of he  i @xmath115876 , h@xmath26 , and he  i @xmath117065 plotted as a function of velocity at three epochs for sn  2011hw ( black ) and sn  2006jc ( orange ) .",
    "the full width at half - maximum intensity ( fwhm ) values of the intermediate - width component of these lines are about 1900 km s@xmath15 in sn  2011hw , compared to about 3000 km s@xmath15 in sn  2006jc .",
    "this component likely represents a slower speed for the post - shock gas in sn  2011hw , perhaps resulting from a lower energy explosion or more massive csm ( the hypothesis of more massive csm wold be more consistent with the higher luminosity of sn  2011hw )",
    ". the slower shock speed may be partly responsible for the weaker he  i lines in sn  2011hw as compared to sn  2006jc , since these lines require high excitation .",
    "in addition to the slightly narrower width of the intermediate - width component , sn  2011hw also shows a much narrower emission - line component that is absent in spectra of sn  2006jc .",
    "several of these narrow emission lines exhibit narrow p - cygni absorption features .",
    "measured in both he  i @xmath115876 and h@xmath26 , this blueshifted p  cyg absorption trough runs from roughly @xmath080 to @xmath0250 km s@xmath15 in the day 47 mmt spectrum ( the p - cyg absorption is not as prominent in he  i @xmath117065 ) .",
    "the narrow absorption velocities appear marginally slower in the day 37 spectrum , although this spectrum has lower signal to noise ratio .",
    "the blue edge of the p - cyg absorption therefore indicates a likely maximum speed in the pre - shock stellar wind of the sn  2011hw progenitor of around 250 km s@xmath15 . in sn  2006jc",
    ", the speed of the progenitor s wind was thought to be a few thousand km s@xmath15 ( pastorello et al .  2007 ; foley et al .  2007 ; smith et al .",
    "2008a ) , appropriate for the wind speed of a compact wr star . by comparison ,",
    "the ten - times - slower csm speed in sn  2011hw is much slower than expected for a compact massive star progenitor with a h - depleted , he - rich wind . in other words , the progenitor of sn",
    "2011hw was probably not a classical wr star .",
    "we return to this topic in  3.6 below .",
    "the overall appearance of the optical spectrum of sn  2011hw is dominated by a large number of weak intermediate - width and narrow emission lines ( discussed above ) , superposed on a very irregularly shaped continuum that can not be reproduced by a combination of blackbody components .",
    "qualitatively , the shape of the underlying continuum of sn  2011hw resembles that of sn  2006jc , except that the corrugations in the spectrum and the blue excess emission seem more muted in sn  2011hw .",
    "we therefore experimented with diluting the spectrum of sn  2006jc using a smooth continuum component to match the lower contrast of the features in sn  2011hw .",
    "we found that by diluting the strong features in the spectrum of sn  2006jc with a 6000  k blackbody ( equal contributions of each in the red continuum ) , we can attain a close match to the shape and strength of the blue continuum seen in sn  2011hw ( figure  [ fig : comp ] ) .",
    "some emission features in the sn  2006jc spectrum are still stronger in this comparison , most notably the narrow he  i emission lines and the ca  ii near - infrared triplet .",
    "the ca  ii triplet strengthens at later times in sn  2011hw ( figure  [ fig : spec ] ) , so this difference is likely due to different phases in the spectral evolution . ignoring these , the spectra match surprisingly well .",
    "thus , whatever the origin of the blue / near - uv continuum bump may be in sn 2011hw , it is likely to have the same origin as in sn  2006jc .",
    "previously , we speculated that the blue continuum in sn  2006jc was actually a pseudo - continuum caused by the blending of a large number of broad and intermediate - width fluorescent emission lines that are mostly from fe ( foley et al . 2007 ; smith et al .",
    "these lines produced enhanced blue flux shortward of 4700  , as well as broad bumps at 49005400   and at 61006600  .",
    "chugai ( 2009 ) showed that the `` continuum '' of sn  2006jc could indeed be produced by a large number of blended csm lines , as postulated earlier .",
    "this idea received additional support in the case of sn  2005ip ( smith et al.2009 ) , which had a similar overall shape for its blue excess emission  but in the case of sn  2005ip , the lines were narrower and it was easier to see that the pseudo - continuum actually broke up into a large number of emission lines .",
    "as with the presence of narrow high - excitation coronal lines ( discussed above ) , the blue / near - uv excess might be a consequence of a lower effective optical depth in the csm , allowing more of the hard photons from the post - shock region to penetrate farther into the csm . the lower effective optical depth , in turn , may be due either to a lower h abundance ( compared to normal sne  iin ) or to clumping in the csm , or both .",
    "the continuum component that provides the best match when we dilute the sn  2006jc spectrum is a 6000  k blackbody , as noted above .",
    "temperatures lower than 5300  k and above 6800  k yielded significant discrepancies in the overall continuum shape when compared to sn  2011hw .",
    "the fact that the best - matching temperature is around 6000  k is significant .",
    "apparent continuum shapes that match temperatures of 60007000  k are typical in the spectra of sne  iin that are fading after their main luminosity peak ( see smith et al.2010 ) .",
    "this is probably due to the temperature of the recombination photosphere within the cold dense shell of a sn  iin ( smith et al.2008a ; dessart et al .",
    "2009 ) , similar to the apparent temperatures in normal sne  ii - p ( e.g. , dessart & hillier 2011 ) .",
    "the temperature of @xmath34  k therefore suggests that the difference in contrast of broad continuum features between sn  2011hw and sn  2006jc is the result of an increase in opacity from a small additional amount of h in the csm of sn  2011hw .",
    "the elevated h opacity may also explain why the ca  ii ir triplet strengthened later ( days 4763 ) than in the case of sn  2006jc ( already present on day 13 ) , if the ca  ii emitting region was behind the photosphere until later times .",
    "the role of h abundance is discussed further below .",
    "sn  2006jc was our first well - observed example of a core - collapse sn interacting with dense h - poor / he - rich csm ( see foley et al .  2007 ;",
    "pastorello et al .",
    "2007 , 2008a ; smith et al .  2008b ; immler et al.2008 ) , and it showed significant differences in many observed properties compared to more common cases of h - rich csm interaction in sne  iin .",
    "sn  2011hw was very similar to sn  2006jc , but appears to have an elevated h abundance .",
    "the differences between sn  2006jc and sn  2011hw therefore permit us to understand the impact of adding a small amount of h to otherwise h - poor csm being overrun by a sn shock .",
    "although many apparent consequences of a slightly elevated h abundance have been discussed in the various sections above , we briefly list them again here .",
    "this is meant to underscore how the hypothesis of a slightly elevated h abundance can explain the observed differences between sn  2011hw and sn  2006jc in a self - consistent way . for each",
    ", we describe the way in which the h abundance may act to cause the observed change .",
    "\\(1 ) _ relatively stronger h@xmath26 and weaker he  i emission lines in sn  2011hw .",
    "_ the stronger h@xmath26/he  i ratio may obviously be a direct result of an elevated h abundance , but there is likely an effect that extra opacity provided by h may provide additional cooling and may also absorb much of the lyman continuum radiation required to excite the he  i lines .",
    "\\(2 ) _ the higher luminosity in the secondary peak 2030 days after discovery in sn  2011hw , and the subsequent slower decline rate than sn  2006jc . _ in  3.1 ( figure  [ fig : phot ] ) , we discussed how sn  2011hw has a bump in its light curve 2030 days after discovery , and at that time has a substantially higher luminosity than sn  2006jc . moreover , it fades from this peak at a slower rate than sn  2006jc fades from its main peak , comparable to the fading rate of a sn  iin like sn",
    "1998s ( figure  [ fig : phot ] ) .",
    "the stronger continuum opacity from h may allow a larger resulting csm - interaction luminosity from sn  2011hw at visual wavelengths , whereas the lower h abundance in sn  2006jc may have allowed it to emit a larger fraction of its csm luminosity in the uv and x - rays ( e.g. , chugai 2009 ; immler et al.2008 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) _ the 6000  k blackbody component of the continuum in sn  2011hw .",
    "_ spectra of sn  2006jc exhibit a strong blue / near - uv excess and undulations in the continuum throughout the visual - wavelength range .",
    "similar features are seen in the spectrum of sn  2011hw , but their contrast is muted compared to sn  2006jc . in  3.5 , we showed that the continuum of sn  2011hw could be matched by using a spectrum of sn  2006jc diluted with a @xmath34 k blackbody , with roughly equal contributions of both in the red continuum ( figure  [ fig : comp ] ) .",
    "this additional continuum emission component is closely related to the higher overall optical luminosity in sn  2011hw , and the 6000  k temperature is an important clue that it is extra opacity from h that causes this additional contribution .",
    "\\(4 ) _ narrower csm lines in sn  2011hw .",
    "_ it is generally true that stars with substantial amounts of h present in their outer envelopes have much larger radii than stars of similar luminosity and mass having no h. pertinent examples are that blue supergiants and lbvs usually have stellar radii @xmath35 times larger than h - depleted wr stars of similar initial mass and luminosity .",
    "the larger radius translates to a lower escape velocity from the star s surface , and consequently , a lower value for the observed wind speeds for stars with h envelopes .",
    "thus , it is likely that the narrower csm lines in sn  2011hw as compared to sn  2006jc (  3.4 ) may be attributable to the progenitor s relatively higher h content .",
    "this difference is also closely related to a different stage of evolution for the two progenitors ( see  3.6 below ) .",
    "\\(5 ) _ later appearance of the ca  ii ir triplet_. while strong and relatively broad emission from the ca  ii ir triplet was seen in our first ( day 13 ) spectrum of sn  2006jc ( foley et al.2007 ; smith et al .",
    "2008b ) , these same ca  ii lines did not begin to strengthen in our spectra of sn  2011hw until day 47 .",
    "they became the strongest lines in the day 63 spectrum .",
    "if these ca  ii emission lines arise from sn ejecta crossing the reverse shock , they could have been hidden behind the sn photosphere at early times in sn  2011hw because the elevated h abundance caused higher optical depths at larger radii . in other words , the absence of the ca   ii lines at early times is a consequence of the same effect that causes sn  2011hw to be more luminous and to fade more slowly than sn  2006jc , as discussed in point ( 2 ) above .",
    "all of the observed differences between sn  2011hw and sn  2006jc described above can be plausibly attributed to a somewhat higher h abundance in the csm and progenitor envelope of sn  2011hw .",
    "we suspect that this is indeed the case , but it would be interesting to pursue this hypothesis wih radiation - hydrodynamic simulations of csm interaction using a range of h abundances . such numerical work is also needed to provide a quantitative constraint on the actual h / he abundance ratio . in the absence of such simulations , we draw an analogy with the differences in sne  ib and iib , suggesting that even a small amount of h ( @xmath23 m@xmath36 ; hachinger et al .  2012 ) could have a large impact on the resulting emission from h - depleted csm interaction .",
    "the observational evidence discussed above establishes that in many respects sn  2011hw was very similar to sn  2006jc .",
    "both exhibited evidence for shock interaction with very dense he - rich csm that requires episodic , eruptive mass loss from the progenitor shortly before core collapse .",
    "we argued that several key differences between the two can be understood as a result of sn  2011hw having somewhat more h in its csm , while still maintaining a low h / he ratio compared to sne  iin .    from our analysis",
    ", we find that this body of evidence suggests that the progenitor of sn  2011hw was probably a late - type wn star with h or a member of the ofpe / wn9 class of stars ( bohannan & walborn 1989 ; crowther et al .",
    "1995 ; bianchi et al .",
    "these stars tend to have slower winds than classical early - type ( h - free ) wr stars  i.e. , a few @xmath37 km s@xmath15 instead of several @xmath38 km s@xmath15 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : stars ] ) . from studying the host clusters of ofpe / wn9 stars , st .- louis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find that they reside among populations with ages of 310 myr , corresponding to initial masses of 17100 m@xmath36 if the ofpe / wn9 stars are poised to explode .",
    "figure  [ fig : stars ] compares the spectra of sn  2006jc and sn  2011hw to spectra of early - type wn and ofpe / wn9 stars , respectively .",
    "this latter class of stars is related to the wr stars in the sense that ofpe / wn9 and other late - type wr stars with hydrogen in their spectra are generally thought to represent a transitional phase between an lbv and a classical h - free wr star ; like lbvs , they are often surrounded by circumstellar shells ( walborn 1982 ; stahl 1987 ; smith et al .  1994 ; pasquali et al .",
    "1999 ) . from the point of view of expectations from stellar evolution models ,",
    "it is therefore quite surprising to see this type of star undergo core collapse , because the models claim that these stars should just be starting core - he burning , and should still have another 0.51 myr left to live .",
    "this contradiction of standard expectations is a close parallel to the recent recognition that stars that look and behave like lbvs appear to be exploding to make sne  iin , despite theoretical expectations , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "in fact , these two cases are even more closely related than this similarity , because there is actually a direct connection between lbvs and the class of ofpe / wn9 stars . based on classical lbvs like ag  car and r  127",
    ", it has been well established that some of the more massive lbvs are actually seen to have ofpe / wn9 spectral types in their hotter quiescent phases between outbursts ( stahl 1986 ; stahl et al .",
    "it is therefore generally thought that many of the other ofpe / wn9 stars that have not been observed in eruption may in fact be quiescent or dormant lbvs that are not recognised as true lbvs simply because we were not looking at the right time , or perhaps that they are recent graduates of the lbv phase ( crowther et al .",
    "1995 ; bianchi et al .  2004 ; massey et al .",
    "2007 ) . correspondingly , ofpe / wn9 stars ( also referred to as `` lbv candidates '' ) are often surrounded by massive shell nebulae that closely resemble lbv nebulae , as noted above .    associating the progenitor of sn  2011hw with an ofpe / wn9-like star is consistent with the higher h content in sn  2011hw , as compared to the progenitor of sn  2006jc , which seemed to be an early - type wr star with a faster h - poor wind .",
    "sn  2011hw therefore establishes a bridge between the h - poor progenitor of sn  2006jc and more h - rich lbvs ( and correspondingly , a likely continuum from sne  iin to sne  ibn ) , justifying earlier suggestions that the eruptive progenitor of sn  2006jc may have been a star that recently left the lbv phase on the way to becoming a wr star ( foley et al .",
    "sn  2011hw , by comparison , was apparently not as far along in this journey when it underwent core collapse .",
    "there is , of course , no reason to restrict one s consideration of possible progenitors of sn  2011hw to single stars .",
    "mass transfer in massive interacting binaries can also drive the transition from h - rich to he - rich stellar atmospheres and csm .",
    "ry  scuti is an example of a massive binary caught in this phase ( grundstrom et al .",
    "it is an o9/b0 supergiant eclipsing binary and is surrounded by a very dense , compact nebula that is strongly he enriched , but not completely h free ( smith et al .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2011d ) recently showed that ry  scuti s surrounding csm nebula was produced by a series of episodic mass ejections , similar in principle to those required to produce the dense csm around sne  iin and ibn .",
    "ry  scuti is therefore a potential example of what a progenitor system of sn  2011hw might look like .",
