    "the discovery of long - lasting coherent oscillations in two - dimensional spectra obtained for a number of photosynthetic antenna complexes up to physiological temperatures @xcite has triggered a host of theoretical investigations ( for a review , see ref   ) . a controversial discussion focussed on the role of vibrational degrees of freedom ( dofs ) .",
    "traditionally , vibrations have been considered to form a heat bath , thus leading to phase and energy relaxation and serving the purpose of directed downhill energy transfer.@xcite with the decoherence time of the observed oscillations considerably exceeding the expectations based on typical line widths of electronic transitions , the coupling to vibrations was reconsidered with the result that it might be more important than anticipated based on the smallness of the huang - rhys ( hr ) factor.@xcite in fact a special role was ascribed to a vibrational mode having a frequency that matches the electronic energy gap between neighbouring bacteriochlorophyll sites.@xcite such a mode , which for the relevant sites one to three in the fmo complex should have a frequency of about 180 , could facilitate vibrationally - assisted resonance transfer . in terms of the eigenstates of the coulomb - coupled excitonic and vibronic excitations",
    "there might be a considerable quantum state mixing @xcite making an analysis of the observed spectra in terms of pure electronic or vibronic excitations difficult.@xcite interestingly , a popular experimentally determined spectral density features a peak in the 180 region .",
    "@xcite    simulations of coupled exciton - vibrational dynamics are usually performed using non - perturbative and non - markovian methods such as the hierarchy equation of motion @xcite or path integral approaches.@xcite here , the dynamics is obtained explicitly only for the relevant system , whereas the bath is traced out in the reduced density operator.@xcite apart from a few examples , where a single vibrational mode has been kept alive in the relevant system@xcite , the latter consists of the excitonic dofs only .",
    "hence , there is no access to the explicit dynamics of the vibrational modes within these system - bath approaches . in passing we",
    "note that the inclusion of a single vibrational mode into the relevant system has , of course , some arbitrariness with respect to the choise of the modes properties .    in the present contribution we study",
    "the coupled exciton - vibrational dynamics from a completely different perspective .",
    "specifically , we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation for a high - dimensional model of the fmo complex .",
    "this allows us , for the first time , to access information on the dynamics of electronic ground / excited state vibrational / vibronic excitations during excitation energy transfer in this complex .",
    "this becomes possible due to the special structure of the frenkel exciton hamiltonian , which is ideally suited for the combination with the multilayer multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree ( ml - mctdh ) wave packet propagation method.@xcite",
    "we will use the standard frenkel exciton hamiltonian to describe an aggregate with @xmath0 sites ( site index @xmath1 ) , each site having the excitation energy @xmath2 , and different sites being coupled by the coulomb interaction @xmath3 : @xmath4 local electronic states are restricted to the ground , @xmath5 , and excited , @xmath6 , states , i.e.  the local or diabatic one - exciton states are given by @xmath7 . for",
    "the present simulations we will adopt the 8-site fmo hamiltonian reported by moix and coworkers.@xcite it is reduced to a 3-site model ( sites 1 - 3 ) as suggested by the simulations of population dynamics in ref     @xmath8    diagonalization of this matrix yields the one - exciton eigenstates , @xmath9 , whose decomposition into the local states @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 and shown together with the eigenenergies in figure  .",
    "the local vibrations at site @xmath1 are described in harmonic approximation by the set of dimensionless normal mode coordinates @xmath12 with frequencies @xmath13 , the vibrational hamiltonian reads @xmath14 here , the notation @xmath15 indicates the summation over all vibrational modes of site @xmath1 .",
    "exciton - vibrational coupling is accounted for within the linearly shifted oscillator ( huang - rhys ) model given by @xmath16 the coupling of a particular mode to the local electronic transition and thus the degree of vibronic excitation , is characterized by the hr factor @xmath17 . in system - bath models",
    "this coupling is typically expressed via the spectral density@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a constant to be specified below .",
    "note that @xmath20 corresponds to the spectral density for monomeric bacteriochlorophyll @xmath21 in the actual fmo protein environment .",
    "there are several calculations of this spectral density based on classical molecular dynamics and taking into account the protein and solvent environment .",
    "@xcite however , the reported results differ considerably , with respect to their structure and integrated intensity ; the latter gives the total hr factor for site m : @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite therefore , we will use the experimentally determined spectral density of wendling et al .",
    "@xcite shown in figure  .",
    "it has been obtained from low - temperature site - selected fluorescence , measured for the energetically lowest pigment of the complex under the assumption that the coulomb coupling to the other pigments can be neglected .",
    "the total hr factor was determined as 0.42 .",
    "note , however , that it has recently been pointed out that the correction to the hr factor of particular modes due to the coulomb coupling can be substantial , i.e. for modes in the 180 region up to a factor of 1.5.@xcite notice further that the experimental spectral density covers the range up to about 350 only , whereas some calculations predict distinct structure up to 2000 .",
    "@xcite however , excitonic transition energies between strongly coupled pigments are essentially located in the range up to 300 , what justifies to neglect higher frequency modes . in the present model",
    "we will use the original spectral density from ref   and discretize it into 150 modes within the interval @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the amplitudes of the individual hr factors have been adjusted homogeneously via the constant @xmath19 in eq   such as to preserve @xmath24 upon summation .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation will be solved employing the ml - mctdh method ( for a review , see ref   ) . here , the the state vector is expanded in terms of the local exciton basis according to @xmath25 where the nuclear coordinates are comprised into the @xmath26 dimensional vector @xmath27 . the nuclear wave function for each diabatic state",
    "is expanded into mctdh form @xmath28 here , the @xmath29 are the time - dependent expansion coefficients weighting the contributions of the different hartree products , which are composed of @xmath30 single particle functions ( spfs ) , @xmath31 , for the @xmath32th degree of freedom in state @xmath33 . in ml - mctdh",
    "the spfs itself describe multi - dimensional coordinates that are expanded into mctdh form .",
    "@xcite this nested set of expansions can be represented by so - called ml - mctdh trees .",
    "@xcite the particular choice of this tree may have a strong influence on the required numerical effort .",
    "@xcite in the following simulations we use a grouping according to the magnitude of the hr factor as detailed in the si .",
    "there we also give the other parameters of the ml - mctdh setup .",
    "wave packet propagations have been performed using the heidelberg program package @xcite .",
    "temperature effects due to the thermal population of vibrational states in the electronic ground state are not included . in all case",
    "the initial conditions has been a vertical franck - condon transition at site 1 and the propagation time was 1 ps .     upper panel : diabatic population dynamics for the 3-site fmo model .",
    "lower panels : coherence dynamics as indicated in terms of the off - diagonal elements of the electronic density matrix in the diabatic , i.e.  site - based , representation .",
    "note that the long - time behaviour of the coherences reflects the mixing of the adiabatic states with respect to the diabatic ones ( cf .",
    "figure  ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "figure   shows the diabatic population and coherence dynamics of the 3-site model . the diabatic populations show a clear beating between sites 1 and 2 , overlaid by a damping of both oscillation amplitudes . for site 3 one",
    "observes only rather small amplitude oscillations on top of an otherwise monotonously increasing population .",
    "a fourier decomposition of the population dynamics yields a dominant component at 220 ( period 151 fs ) .",
    "this does not agree with the bare electronic oscillation period , which would be 160 fs ( 208 ) .",
    "it is this difference which actually reflects the modified energy level structure of the coupled exciton - vibrational system . in principle",
    "this oscillatory behaviour is qualitatively similar to previously published results .",
    "the coherences , @xmath34 , between the different sites also show damped oscillations as seen in the lower panels of figure  .",
    "the oscillations of coherence density matrix elements have been related to the off - diagonal peaks in the two - dimensional spectroscopy of the fmo complex.@xcite note , however , that the actual assignment to specific pairs of exciton eigenstates depends on the parametrisation of the hamiltonian .",
    "experimentally , in ref   oscillations at about 160 have been reported , irrespective of temperature in the range between 77  k and 150  k. in the present case , which formally corresponds to zero temperature , the dominant frequencies in this range are at 220 ( @xmath35 ) and at 190 ( @xmath36 ) ; both frequencies occurring for @xmath37 .",
    "we also observe that the amplitudes of these oscillations decay considerably within the given time window due to the coulomb coupling induced mixing between electronic and vibronic / vibrational excitations .",
    "apparently , the finite but large number of vibrational dofs is sufficient to mimic excitonic energy relaxation and coherence dephasing .",
    "vibronic ( upper row ) and vibrational ( lower row ) excitation dynamics of the 3-site fmo model using a discretization of the spectral density into 150 equally spaced modes in the interval @xmath23 $ ] for each monomer .",
    "note that the vibrational excitation of site 3 is close to zero and not shown .",
    "the spectral density is given in the left panels .",
    "the lower right panel shows the spectrum of one - exciton eigenstates and their decomposition into amplitudes of ( local ) diabatic states .",
    "the color code covers the interval from 0 to 3 ; zero point energy has been subtracted . ]    in order to investigate the vibronic / vibrational excitation more closely we consider the dynamics in the different potential energy surfaces .",
    "specifically , we define the operator @xmath38 whose expectation value gives the vibrational energy in the electronic ground states for monomer @xmath1 , no matter the electronic population of the other monomers @xmath39 .",
    "the vibronic energy at monomer @xmath1 follows from the expectation value of    @xmath40    figure   shows the dynamics of vibronic and vibrational excitations for the situation of figure  .",
    "first , we notice that the degree of excitation is rather small .",
    "expectation values of the energy do not exceed 3 for individual modes .",
    "second , there is a marked difference between the individual sites and the dynamics in their respective potential energy surfaces .",
    "this can be explained either in a dynamical or an eigenstate picture . within a dynamical picture",
    "vibrational excitation in the electronic ground state corresponding , e.g. , to the site of initial electronic excitation , is a consequence of the finite transfer time between sites 1 and 2 . if the latter is longer than the time scale of vibrational motion the initial vibronic wave packet moves out of the original franck - condon window",
    "thus , upon deexcitation during the transfer event , vibrationally excited states are populated in the electronic ground state .",
    "we emphasise that the oscillations due to exciton transfer observed in figure   are reflected as well in the vibrational and vibronic excitations .",
    "eventually , the exciton population is accumulated at site 3 and so is the vibronic excitation .",
    "the trapping at site 3 comes along with negligible vibrational excitation at this site ( not shown ) .",
    "however , the nonequilibrium vibrational excitation at sites 1 and 2 is maintained even at 1 ps .",
    "note that in order to describe vibrational relaxation , which would be relevant at longer time scales , one should include anharmonic interactions among the harmonic oscillator modes .",
    "third , considerable excitation is restricted to certain mode frequency ranges and here most notably between about 160 to 200 . in the dynamical picture",
    "this could be explained by the fact that the electronic time scale is about 160 fs , i.e. only modes with higher frequencies have a chance to leave the franck - condon window and , therefore , become vibrationally excited .",
    "the selectivity of strong vibronic excitation in particular at site 3 is better explained in terms of a resonance effect , i.e. vibrationally - assisted exciton transfer .",
    "this is similar to the vibronic enhancement of exciton transport discussed for allophycocyanine dimers in ref   . in figure",
    "we also show the electronic eigenenergies and the decomposition of eigenstates into the local exciton basis .",
    "the energetic separation between adjacent eigenstates is around 200 , which explains the preference of excitation for this region of the spectral density .",
    "vibronic ( upper row ) and vibrational ( lower row ) excitation dynamics of the 3-site fmo model using a reduced description where only vibrational modes with frequencies in the interval @xmath41 $ ] were included .",
    "the lower right panel compares the diabatic populations for full ( dots ) and reduced ( lines ) models .",
    "the color code covers the interval from 0 to 3 ; zero point energy has been subtracted . ]    in order to investigate the role of the high frequency part of the spectral density closer , we have studied a reduced model where only modes in the range @xmath41 $ ] were included .",
    "the resulting dynamics is shown in figure  .",
    "the lower right panel compares full and reduced models in terms of the diabatic population dynamics .",
    "clearly , the differences between the two models are small and can be found mostly in the amplitudes of the oscillations , which are generally larger in the reduced model .",
    "the vibrational and vibronic excitation also behaves similar , with the main difference being higher excitation energies obtained for the reduced model which reaches 4 per mode . comparing figure   with figure   this",
    "can be interpreted as the effect of vibrational energy redistribution , which is more pronounced in the full model due to the larger spectral range that is available .",
    "we emphasise again that for a single site the vibrational dofs are decoupled by construction of the model .",
    "vibrational energy redistribution is possible solely due to the coulomb coupling between the sites .     ]",
    "in summary , we have presented a numerically exact quantum dynamics simulation of the coulomb - coupled exciton - vibrational dynamics of a 3-site model of    most notably we have found that typical time scales for excitonic energy and phase relaxation can be reproduced by a finite discretization of an experimental spectral density .",
    "further , in accordance with previous suggestions @xcite modes in the 180 region play an important role for the transfer .",
    "the novel feature of explicit full - dimensional quantum dynamics used in the present simulation , however , is that it gives access to the dynamics of all dofs .",
    "this allowed to discover that a large number of modes between 160 and 300 are actually excited in the electronic ground and excited states .",
    "in other words , the reduction to a single mode represents a rather strong approximation .",
    "we conclude by pointing out that the present simulation provides further evidence for the exceptional role that is played by vibrational and vibronic excitations in photosynthetic energy transfer .  @xcite    the authors thank the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) for financial support through the sfb 652 .",
