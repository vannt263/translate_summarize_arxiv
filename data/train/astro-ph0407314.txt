    "the origin and history of cosmic rays has been a subject of intensifying interest . for more than a decade",
    ", a large body of work has focused on the light elements li , be , and b ( libeb ) as signatures of cosmic - ray interactions with the diffuse gas ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "libeb abundances in galactic halo stars have been used to probe the history of cosmic rays in the ( proto-)galaxy .",
    "more recently , a great deal of attention has been focused on high - energy @xmath1-rays also produced in interactions during cosmic - ray propagation . here , we draw attention to the tight connection between these observables , particularly between @xmath1-rays and 6 .",
    "the abundances of libeb nuclei encode the history of cosmic ray exposure in local matter . in the past 15 years or so",
    ", measurements of libeb in the sun and in galactic disk have been joined by libeb observations in halo stars ; these offer particularly valuable information about cosmic - ray origins and interactions in galactic and proto - galactic matter . in particular , different scenarios for cosmic ray origin",
    "lead to different libeb trends , which have been modeled and compared with observations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . for the purposes of this paper , the details of these models are less important than the following basic distinction : _ all _ libeb species",
    "are produced as cosmic rays interact with interstellar gas and fragment``spall''heavy nuclei , e.g. , @xmath4 .",
    "however , the fusion processes @xmath5 yield lithium isotopes exclusively , and indeed dominate the cosmic - ray production of li @xcite .",
    "this makes cosmic - ray lithium production particularly `` clean '' since its evolution depends uniquely on its exposure to cosmic rays , and unlike be and b , does _ not _ depend on the ambient heavy element abundances .",
    "cosmic - ray interactions provide the _ only _ known source for the nucleosynthesis of 6 , 9 , and 10 , making these species ideal observables of cosmic ray activity .",
    "the story is more complex for 11 , which can also be produced in core - collapse supernovae by the `` neutrino process '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , 7 has the most diverse lineage . in the early galaxy , and",
    "hence in halo stars , 7 is dominated by the contribution from primordial nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , with a small contribution from cosmic - ray fusion as well as the neutrino process @xcite . at late times , and",
    "hence in disk stars including the sun , 7 has important and probably dominant contributions from longer - lived , low - mass stars ( though the specific site remains controversial : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper we will build on the work of @xcite to point out the possible importance of another , _ pre - galactic _ , source of cosmic - ray 7 and 6 , which could confound attempts to identify the pre - galactic li abundance with the primordial component .",
    "we can not rule out ( or in ! ) this possible source , but we will constrain it using observations of @xmath1-rays .    cosmic - ray interactions with interstellar gas",
    "produce not only libeb , but also inevitably produce @xmath1-rays .",
    "cosmic rays in the galactic disk today lead to pronounced emission seen in the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "cosmic ray populations in ( and between ! ) external galaxies would contribute to a diffuse extragalactic @xmath1-ray background ( hereafter the egrb ) .",
    "the existence of an egrb was already claimed by some of the first @xmath1-ray observations @xcite .",
    "the most recent high - energy ( i.e. , roughly in the 30 mev  30 gev range ) @xmath1-ray observations are those of the egret experiment on the compton gamma - ray observatory , and the egret team also found evidence for a egrb @xcite .",
    "the intensity , energy spectrum , and even the existence of an egrb are not trivial to measure , as this information only arises as the residual after subtracting the dominant galactic foreground from the observed @xmath1-ray sky .",
    "the procedure for foreground subtraction is thus crucial , and different procedures starting with the same egret data have arrived at an egrb with a lower intensity and different spectrum @xcite , or have even failed to find evidence for an egrb at all @xcite . despite these uncertainties , we will see that the egrb ( or limits to it ) and li abundances are mutually very constraining .    whether or not an egrb has yet been detected , at some level it certainly should exist .",
    "egret detections of individual active galactic nuclei ( blazars ) as well as the milky way and the lmc together guarantee that unresolved blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and to a lesser extent normal galaxies @xcite , will generate a signal at or near the levels claimed for the egrb .",
    "many other egrb sources have been proposed , but one of the promising has been a subject of intense interest recently : namely , @xmath1-rays originating from a cosmological component of cosmic rays .",
    "this as - yet putative cosmic - ray population would originate in shocks @xcite associated with baryonic infall and merger events during the growth of large - scale cosmic structures .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would then generate a population of relativistic ions and electrons .",
    "gamma - ray emission would then follow from inverse compton scattering of electrons off of the ambient photon backgrounds and from @xmath6 production due to hadronic collisions @xcite .",
    "the most recent semi - analytical and numerical calculations @xcite suggest that this `` structure forming '' component to the egrb is likely below the blazar contribution , but the observational and theoretical uncertainties here remain large ; upcoming @xmath1-ray observations by glast @xcite will shed welcome new light on this problem .",
    "the link between the nucleosynthesis and @xmath1-ray signatures of cosmic - ray history has been pointed out by others in multiple contexts .",
    "we note in particular the prescient work of @xcite , who in a series of papers considered the implications of a hypothetical population of `` cosmological cosmic rays '' in addition to the usual galactic cosmic rays .",
    "montmerle s analysis is impressive in its foresight and its breadth .",
    "@xcite develops the formalism for a homogeneous population of cosmological cosmic rays ( assumed to be created instantaneously at some redshift ) , and describes their propagation in an expanding universe , as well as their light element and @xmath1-ray production .",
    "he identifies the tight connection between 6 and extragalactic @xmath1-rays , and exploits this connection to use the available egrb data to constrain li production for a variety of different assumptions .",
    "a particularly pertinent case involves an egrb near the levels discussed today ( `` normalization 2 '' in montmerle s parlance ) , coupled with a cosmic baryon density close to modern values ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under these conditions",
    ", @xcite finds that cosmological cosmic ray activity sufficient to explain the egrb leads to a present 6 abundance that is about an order of magnitude smaller than the solar abundance .",
    "this result foreshadows an important conclusion we will find : if the solar 6 abundance is produced by galactic cosmic rays , then the associated pionic @xmath1-ray production exceeds the _ entire _ egrb by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "more recently , studies of structure formation cosmic rays have focused primarily on their @xmath1-ray signatures . however , recently @xcite also proposed using 6 as a diagnostic of shock activity in the local group .",
    "these authors note that the resulting 6 abundances in halo stars could be used to probe the shocks and resulting cosmic rays in proto - galactic matter .",
    "we also will draw on this idea , with an emphasis on the fact that pre - galactic li production would be ( by itself ) observationally indistinguishable from the primordial 7 production from big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "thus we attempt to use egrb data to constrain this possibility , but find that current data is unable to rule out a significant contribution to halo star li abundances from structure formation cosmic rays .",
    "our work thus follows these pioneering efforts , further emphasizing and formally exploring the intimate connection between cosmic - ray nucleosynthesis and high - energy @xmath1-ray astrophysics . in ",
    "[ sect : gamma - li6 ] , we formally show and discuss the generality and tightness of the @xmath7-@xmath1 connection , and in  [ sect : obs ] the relevant observations are reviewed . in ",
    "[ sect : gcr ] we use the theory of libeb production by galactic cosmic rays to deduce the minimal contribution the egrb . in ",
    "[ sect : sfcr ] we exploit the link to use the observed egrb to limit the sfcr contribution to pre - galactic lithium .",
    "discussion and conclusions appear in ",
    "[ sect : discuss ] .",
    "before doing a detailed calculation let us first establish a simple , back of the envelope , connection between gamma - rays and lithium .",
    "we know that low energy ( @xmath8 mev / nucleon ) hadronic cosmic rays produce lithium through @xmath9 . but",
    "higher - energy ( @xmath10 mev / nucleon ) cosmic rays also produce @xmath1-rays via neutral pion decay : @xmath2 . because they share a common origin in hadronic cosmic ray interactions",
    ", we can directly relate cosmic ray lithium production to `` pionic '' gamma - rays .",
    "the cosmic - ray production rate of @xmath7 per unit volume is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the net cosmic ray he flux , @xmath13 is the interstellar he abundance , and @xmath14 is the cross section for 6 production , appropriately averaged over the cosmic - ray energy spectrum ( detailed definitions and normalization conventions appear in appendix [ sect : norm ] ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath7 mole fraction @xmath15 is just @xmath16 . where @xmath17 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the cosmic - ray production rate of pionic @xmath1-rays is just the pion production rate times a factor of 2 , that is , @xmath18 .",
    "integrated over a line of sight towards the cosmic particle horizon , this gives a egrb intensity @xmath19 .",
    "thus we see that both the 6 abundance and the @xmath1-ray intensity have a common factor of the ( time - integrated ) cosmic - ray flux , and so we can eliminate this factor and express each observable in terms of the other : y_6 ~y_,cr y_,gas i _ [ eq : connection ] from eq .",
    "( [ eq : connection ] ) we see that the connection between cosmic - ray lithium production and pionic gamma - ray flux is straight forward .",
    "this rough argument shows the intimacy of the connection between 6 and pionic @xmath1-rays .",
    "however , this simplistic treatment does not account for the expansion of the universe , nor for time - variations in the cosmic - cosmic ray flux , nor for the inhomogeneous distribution of sources within the universe .",
    "we now include these effects in a more rigorous treatment .",
    "for li production at location @xmath20 , the production rate per unit ( physical ) volume is q_li ( ) = _ _ ^cr ( ) n_,gas ( ) = y_,cr y_^ism _ _ p^cr ( ) n_b , gas ( ) ( ) _ li ( ) n_b ( ) here , @xmath21 is the cosmic - ray he / h ratio , and is assumed to be constant in space and time .",
    "the target density of ( interstellar or intergalactic ) helium is @xmath22 , which we write in terms of its ratio @xmath23 to the baryon density .",
    "we take @xmath24 to be constant in space and time , but we do not assume this for the baryon density @xmath25 .",
    "the baryonic gas fraction = n_b , gas / n_b accounts for the fact that not all baryons need to be in a diffuse form . finally , we will find it convenient to write @xmath26 in terms of the local baryon density and the local li production rate @xmath27 per baryon .    with these expressions",
    ", we have @xmath28 which we can solve to get y_li(,t ) & = & _ 0^t dt^  ( , t^ )  _ li(,t^ ) + [ eq : li ] & = & y_,cr y_^ism _ _",
    "0^t dt^   ( , t^ )  _ p^cr(,t^ ) + & = & y_,cr y_^ism _ f_p(x , t ) where @xmath29 is the local proton fluence ( time - integrated flux ) , weighted by the gas fraction .",
    "thus we see that li ( and particularly 6 ) serves as a `` cosmic - ray dosimeter '' which measures the net local cosmic ray exposure .",
    "we now turn to @xmath1 rays from hadronic sources , most of which come from neutral pion production and decay : @xmath2 . the extragalactic background due to these process is expected to be isotropic ( at least to a good approximation ) . in this case , the total @xmath1-ray intensity @xmath30 , integrated over all energies , is given by an integral [ eq : intensity ] i_(t ) = _ 0^t dt^  q_^com(t^ ) of the sources over the line of sight to the horizon .",
    "we are interested in particular in the case of hadronic sources , so that @xmath31 is the total ( energy - integrated ) comoving rate of hadronic @xmath1-ray production per unit volume ; here @xmath32 is the usual cosmic scale factor , which we normalize to a present value of @xmath33 . a formal derivation of eq",
    ".   appears in appendix [ sect : radtransf ] , but one can arrive at this result from elementary considerations .",
    "namely , note that the comoving number density of photons produced at any point is just @xmath34 .",
    "we neglect photon absorption and scattering processes , and thus particle number conservation along with homogeneity and isotropy together demand that the comoving number density of ambient photons at any point is the same as the comoving number density of photons produced there .",
    "furthermore , the total ( energy - integrated ) photon intensity is also isotropic and thus by definition is @xmath35 , which is precisely what we find in eq .   .",
    "the comoving rate of pionic @xmath1-ray production per unit volume at point @xmath36 is [ eq : qgamma ] q_^com(,t ) = _ _ p(,t ) n_h , gas^com(,t ) = ( , t ) _",
    "_ p(,t ) n_h^com(,t ) where @xmath37 is the ( comoving ) hydrogen density , and @xmath38 is the total ( integrated over rest - frame energy @xmath39 ) omnidirectional cosmic ray proton flux .",
    "the flux - averaged pionic @xmath1-ray production cross section is _ 2 _ _ _ ^0 = 2 _ where the factor of 2 counts the number of photons per pion decay , @xmath40 is the cross section for pion production and @xmath41 is the pion multiplicity , and the factor @xmath42 accounts for @xmath43 and @xmath44 reactions @xcite .",
    "then we have i_(t ) = y_h _ _ 0^t dt  ( )   _ p(,t ) = _ y_h^ismf_p(t ) where f_p(t ) = _ 0^t dt  ( )   _ p ( ) is a mean value of the cosmic - ray fluence along the line of sight , where the average is weighted by the gas fraction and the ratio @xmath45 of the local baryon density along the photon path .",
    "note that the @xmath1-ray sources are sensitive to the overlap of the cosmic - ray flux with the diffuse hydrogen gas density , and thus need not be homogeneous .",
    "even so , we still assume the ergb intensity to be isotropic , which corresponds to the assumption that the line - of - sight integral over the sources averages out any fluctuations .",
    "one further technical note : @xmath46 represents the total pionic @xmath1-ray flux , integrated over photon energies .",
    "while this quantity is well - defined theoretically , real observations have some energy cutoff , and thus report @xmath47 , typically with @xmath48 mev .",
    "but the spectrum of pionic @xmath1-rays will be shifted towards lower energies if they originate from a nonzero redshift .",
    "thus it is clear that @xmath1-ray intensity @xmath49 , integrated above some energy @xmath50 , will be redshift - dependent .",
    "a way to eliminate this @xmath51-dependence is to include _ all _ pionic @xmath1-rays , that is to take @xmath52 , i.e. , to take @xmath53 .",
    "as discussed in more detail in appendix [ sect : radtransf ] , the @xmath7-@xmath1 proportionality is only exact for @xmath54 , as this quantity removes photon redshifting effects which spoil the proportionality for @xmath50 .",
    "thus we will have to use information on the pionic spectrum to translate between @xmath55 and @xmath54 ; these issues are discussed further in  [ sect : pionic ] .",
    "thus we see that the lithium abundance and the pionic @xmath1-ray intensity ( spectrum integrated from 0 energy ) arise from very similar integrals , which we can express via the ratio [ eq : gamma2li ] = where @xmath56 denotes 6 or 7 . note that this `` @xmath1-to - lithium '' ratio has its only significant space and time dependence via the ratio @xmath57 of the line - of - sight baryon - averaged fluence to the local fluence .",
    "the relationship expressed in eq .",
    "is the main result of this paper , and we will bring this tool to bear on li and @xmath1-ray observations , using each to constrain the other . to do this , it will be convenient to write eq .",
    "in the form [ eq : main ] i_(t ) = i_0,i where the scaling factor i_0,i = y_i , is independent of time and space , and only depends , via the ratio of cross sections , on the shape of the cosmic - ray population considered .",
    "table [ table : scaling ] presents the values of @xmath58 for the different spectra that will be considered in the following sections .",
    "values of the scaling factor were obtained by using photon multiplicity @xmath59 , @xmath60 , baryon number density @xmath61 , cr and ism helium abundances @xmath62 and solar abundances @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite . for the @xmath6 and lithium production cross - sections",
    ", we used the fits taken from @xcite and @xcite , and from that obtained the ratios of flux - averaged cross - sections for different spectra , and these are also presented in table [ table : scaling ] .",
    "@xmath65 & & & + population & & @xmath66 & @xmath67 & 7/6 + gcr & @xmath68 & @xmath69 & 0.21 & 0.28 & 1.3 + sfcr & @xmath70 & @xmath71 & 1.02 & 2.03 & 2.0 +    table [ table : scaling ] shows that the different cosmic - ray spectra lead to very different li - to-@xmath1 ratios .",
    "for example , the 6-to-@xmath1 ratio @xmath66 is almost a factor of 5 higher in the sfcr case than in the gcr case .",
    "the reason for this stems from the different threshold behaviors and energy dependences of the li and @xmath6 production cross sections .",
    "li production via @xmath44 fusion has a threshold around 10 mev / nucleon , above which the cross section rapidly rises through some resonant peaks .",
    "then beyond @xmath72 mev / nucleon , the cross section for 6 _ drops _ exponentially as @xmath73@xcite , rapidly suppressing the importance of any projectiles with @xmath74 mev / nucleon .",
    "thus , as has been widely discussed , li production is a low - energy phenomenon for which the important projectile energy range is roughly @xmath75 mev / nucleon .    on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath76 production has a higher threshold of 280 mev , and the effective cross section @xmath77 _ rises _ with energy up to and beyond 1 gev .",
    "neutral pion production is thus a significantly higher - energy phenomenon .",
    "these different cross section behaviors are sensitive to the differences in the two cosmic - ray spectra we adopt .",
    "on the one hand , we adopt a gcr spectrum that is a power law in _",
    "total _ energy : @xmath78 , a good approximation to the locally observed ( i.e. , _ propagated _ ) spectrum .",
    "this spectrum is roughly constant for @xmath79 .",
    "thus , there is no reduction in cosmic - ray flux between the li and @xmath6 thresholds .",
    "furthermore the flux only begins to drop far above the @xmath6 threshold at 280 mev , so that there is significant pion production over a large range of energies , in contrast to the intrinsically narrow energy window for li production . as a result of the effects , @xmath80 for the gcr case .",
    "in contrast , the sfcr flux is taken to be the standard result for diffusive acceleration due to a strong shock : namely , a power law in momentum @xmath81 .",
    "this goes to @xmath82 at @xmath83 , and @xmath84 at higher energies .",
    "this spectrum thus drops by a factor of 28 between the li and @xmath6 thresholds , and continues to drop above the @xmath6 threshold , offsetting the rise in the pion cross section .",
    "this behavior thus suppresses @xmath6 production relative to the gcr case , and thus we have a significantly higher @xmath66 ratio .",
    "as we will see , these ratios  and the differences between them  will be critical in deriving quantitative constraints .",
    "we have seen that the egrb intensity and lithium abundances are closely linked . here",
    "we collect information on both observables .",
    "ever since @xmath1-rays were first observed towards the galactic poles as well as in the plane @xcite , the existence of emission at high galactic latitudes has been regarded as an indication of an egrb . however , any information regarding the intensity , energy spectrum , and even the existence of the egrb is only as reliable as the procedure for subtracting the galactic foreground .",
    "such procedures are unfortunately non - trivial and model - dependent .",
    "the egret team @xcite used an empirical model for tracers of galactic hydrogen and starlight , and found evidence for an egrb which dominates polar emission .",
    "other groups have recently presented new analyses of the egret data . in a semi - empirical approach using a model of galactic @xmath1-ray sources , @xcite also find evidence for an egrb , but with a different energy spectrum and a generally lower intensity than the @xcite result .",
    "finally , @xcite find that the galactic foreground is sufficiently uncertain that its contribution to the polar emission can be significant , possibly saturating the observations .",
    "consequently , the @xcite analysis is unable to confirm the existence of an egrb in the egret data ; instead , they can only to place upper limits on the egrb intensity .",
    "it was recently shown by @xcite that a model - independent limit on the fraction of egrb flux that is of pionic origin ( gamma rays that originate from @xmath6 decay ) can be placed .",
    "their limit comes from noticing that the egrb shows no strong evidence of the distinctive shape pionic @xmath1-ray spectral peak at @xmath85 , the `` pion bump . ''",
    "thus by comparing the shapes of the observed egrb and theoretical pionic gamma - ray spectrum , they were able to maximize the pionic flux so that it stays below the observed one .",
    "this procedure allowed them to place constraints on the maximal fraction of egrb that can be of pionic origin .    for the pionic @xmath1-ray source - function",
    ", @xcite used a semi - analytic fit from the @xcite paper and the @xcite model for the production cross section .",
    "a key feature of the pionic @xmath1-ray spectrum is that it approaches a power law at both high and low energies , going to @xmath86 for @xmath87 and to @xmath88 for @xmath89 . in dermer",
    "s model , the @xmath1-ray spectral index @xmath90 is equal to the cosmic - ray spectral index .",
    "@xcite adopted the value @xmath91 for pionic extragalactic @xmath1-rays , which is consistent with blazars and structure - forming cosmic rays as their origin . in this simple analysis",
    ", @xcite used a single - redshift approximation , that is , they assumed that these @xmath1-rays are all coming from one redshift , and thus their limit on the maximal pionic fraction is a function of @xmath51 .    to obtain the egrb spectrum from egret data , a careful subtraction of galactic foreground is needed . @xcite",
    "considered two different egrb spectra and obtained the following limit : for the @xcite spectrum they found that the pionic fraction of the egrb ( integrated spectra above 100 mev ) can be as low as about 40% for cosmic rays that originated at present , to about 90 % for @xmath92 ; for the more shallow spectrum of @xcite they found that pionic fraction can go from about 30% for @xmath93 up to about 70% for @xmath92 .",
    "however , the @xcite analysis of the egret data implies that the galactic foreground dominates the @xmath1-ray sky so that only an upper limit on the egrb can be placed , namely @xmath94 .",
    "thus , in this case , we were not able to obtain the pionic fraction .",
    "however , to be able to connect the pionic @xmath1-ray intensity @xmath49 with lithium mole fraction @xmath95 as shown in ( [ eq : gamma2li ] ) , @xmath49 must include all of the pionic @xmath1-rays , that is , the spectrum has to be integrated from energy @xmath53 .",
    "the upper limit to the pionic @xmath1-ray intensity above energy @xmath96 for a given redshift can be written as @xmath97 d\\epsilon\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the upper limit to the fraction of pionic @xmath1-rays @xcite , @xmath99 is the observed intensity above some energy , while @xmath100 $ ] is the semi - analytic fit for pionic @xmath1-ray spectrum @xcite which is maximized with @xmath101 normalization constant .",
    "an upper limit to the pionic @xmath1-ray intensity that covers all energies @xmath102 , follows immediately from the above equations : [ eq : i0 ] i_(>0,z)=f_(>_0,z ) i_^obs(>_0 )    now this is something that is semi - observational and can be easily obtained from @xmath1-ray intensity observed above some energy , and from @xcite and @xcite results .      given the egrb intensity , we will infer the amount of associated lithium production .",
    "it will be of interest to compare this not only to the solar abundance , but also to the primordial abundance of 7 .",
    "metal - poor halo stars ( extreme population ii ) serve as a `` fossil record '' of pre - galactic lithium .",

    "possible explanations for this discrepancy include unknown or underestimated systematic errors in theory and/or observations or new physics ; these are discussed thoroughly elsewhere ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and refs therein ) . for our purposes",
    ", we will acknowledge this discrepancy by comparing pre - galactic lithium production by cosmic rays with both the observed and cmb - based li abundances .",
    "we have shown that 6 abundances and extragalactic @xmath1-rays are linked because both sample cosmic - ray fluence , and now apply this formalism to @xmath1-ray and 6 data . in this section",
    "we turn to the hadronic products of galactic cosmic rays , which are believed to be the dominant source of 6 , but a sub - dominant contribution to the egrb .",

    "notice that in equation ( [ eq : galactic ] ) we have the ratio of two integrals where integrands are identical , thus normalizations and constants will cancel out .",
    "therefore , instead of using the complete form of @xmath132 we need only use the spectral shape of the pionic gamma - ray source function @xcite , that is , only the part that is energy - and redshift - dependent .    finally then",
    ", we find [ eq : gamlim ] i_,^0 ( > 0.1 gev ) = 3.22 10 ^ -5  cm^-2  s^-1  sr^-1 which we can now compare to the observed egrb values @xmath133 that are given in the first column of table [ table : res ] .",
    "as one can see , our _ pionic _ egrb gamma - ray intensity is between 2 and 6 times larger than the _ entire _ observed value !",
    "we thus conclude that the solar 6 abundance , if made by gcrs as usually assumed , seems to demand an enormous diffuse pionic @xmath1-ray contribution , far above the entire egrb level .",
    "how might this discrepancy be resolved ?",
    "one explanation follows by dropping our assumption that @xmath134 , i.e. , that the baryon - weighted milky way gcr fluence is the same as the cosmic mean for star - forming galaxies . note that we have @xmath135 , where @xmath114 is the global galactic star formation rate ( assuming @xmath113 ) , and @xmath136 the galactic gas content .",
    "if our galaxy has an above - average star formation rate and/or gas mass , this will increase the local 6 production relative to the average over all galactic populations , and thus lead to an overestimate of the egrb .    in this connection it is noteworthy to compare our 6-based estimate of the galactic egrb contribution to the work of @xcite .",
    "that calculation adopted the same model for the redshift history of cosmic - ray flux and interstellar gas , and so only differed from the present calculation in the normalization to galactic values . @xcite",
    "normalized to the _ present _ galactic @xmath1-ray luminosity .",
    "this amounts to a calibration not to the time - integrated cosmic - ray _ fluence _ , but rather to the instantaneous cosmic ray _",
    ", as determined by the @xcite emissivity , a galactic gas mass of @xmath137 , and an estimate of the present galactic star formation rate .",
    "this normalization gave a galactic egrb component which at all energies lies _ below _ the total @xcite background .",
    "our calculation is normalized to solar 6 , which is a direct measure of galactic ( or at least solar neighborhood ) cosmic - ray _ fluence _ , and which contains fewer uncertainties than the factors entering in the @xcite result . yet",
    "surprisingly , the 6-based fluence result gives a high pionic egrb , while the more uncertain normalization gives an acceptable result .",
    "can we independently test whether our galaxy has had an above - average cosmic - ray exposure ? this present a challenge , as we require an integral measure of cosmic - ray activity , which is readily available locally but difficult to obtain in external galaxies .",
    "the best candidates are the libeb isotopes ; 6 is ideal for the reasons we have outlined , but is not accessible in stars bright enough to be see in even the nearest external galaxies .",
    "the best hope then would be for measurements of , in the local group or beyond . in the smc ,",
    "such measurements have placed interesting limits on boron abundances @xcite , though the presence of the neutrino - process production of 11 makes boron observations more difficult to interpret than beryllium .",
    "another explanation for the high intensity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamlim ] ) stems from noting that the required ergb intensity is much larger for gcrs than that one would infer from sfcrs , due to the large difference in the @xmath138 ratio for these two spectra .",
    "were the milky way spectra is atypically skewed to high energies , we would overestimate the @xmath138 ratio and thus the egrb contribution .",
    "this possibility ( which we regard as less likely than the previous one ) could be tested by observations of cosmic - ray spectra in external galaxies , e.g. , by @xmath1-ray observations of local group galaxies such as glast should perform @xcite .",
    "finally , a related but more unconventional view would be that 6 is in fact primarily made by sfcrs themselves , rather than by gcrs . this suggestion is further discussed and constrained below ,  [ sect : sfcr ] .",
    "we close this subsection by noting that if the depletion of 6 is taken into consideration , one might use 6 abundance larger than solar . in that case",
    "one would find that the accompanying _ pionic _ egrb gamma - ray intensity is more than 2 - 6 times greater than the observed egrb .",
    "we can exploit equation ( [ eq : main ] ) in both directions .",
    "here we use the observed egrb spectrum to constrain the 6 abundance produced via galactic cosmic rays . by comparing this galactic 6 component to the observed solar abundance we can then place an upper limit on the _ residual _ 6 which ( presumably ) was produced by sfcr . as described in  [ sect : pionic ] , with the observed egrb spectrum in hand we can place an upper limit on its fraction of pionic origin . in the case of sfcr - produced pionic gamma - rays",

    "we adopt the `` single - redshift approximation . ''",
    "however , in the case of galactic cosmic rays we have a better understanding of the redshift history of the sources .",
    "therefore , we will follow @xcite to calculate the pionic differential gamma - ray intensity for some set of energies @xmath139}{\\sqrt{\\omega_{\\lambda } + \\omega_m ( 1+z)^3 } }   \\\\    &   & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\times \\left [ \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0,\\rm mw}}-\\left (   \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0,\\rm mw } } -1 \\right ) \\frac{\\int_{z_*}^z dz ( dt / dz)\\dot{\\rho}_\\star(z ) } { \\int_{z_*}^0 dz ( dt / dz)\\dot{\\rho}_\\star(z ) } \\right ]   \\label{eq : gcr_pi_flux}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath140 is in units of @xmath141 , and @xmath142 is the present milky way star formation rate . for the pionic gamma - ray luminosity @xmath143 we will ,",
    "as before , use the pionic gamma - ray source function adopted from @xcite ( @xmath144 for gcr spectrum ) , however we will let the normalization be determined by maximizing the pionic contribution to the egrb .",
    "the adopted parameters , cosmology , and cosmic star formation rate we keep the same as in previous subsection .",
    "once we obtain the spectrum we can then fit it with ( i__e^2)=-14.171 - 0.546 e -0.131 ( e)^2 + 0.032 ( e)^3 where @xmath145 is in gev and @xmath146 is in @xmath147 .",
    "the free leading term in the above equation is set by requiring that @xmath148 at the energy @xmath149 gev which maximizes pionic contribution by demanding that the pionic gamma - ray spectrum always stays below the observed one ( since the feature of pionic peak is not observed ) .",
    "we also fit the @xcite data with ( i_,obs e^2)=-14.003 - 0.144 e -0.097 ( e)^2 + 0.017 ( e)^3 in the same units .    by going through the procedure described in  [ sect : pionic ] ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more detail ) we can now obtain an upper limit to the fraction of pionic gamma - ray compared to the @xcite observed egrb spectrum .",
    "this maximized pionic ( green dashed line ) , as well as the observed , gamma - ray spectrum is presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : fraction ] .",
    "we find the upper limit to pionic fraction to be @xmath150 .",
    "we note in passing that a maximal pionic fraction as appears in fig .  [",
    "fig : fraction ] gives a poor fit at energies both above and below the matching near 0.4 gev , suggesting the presence of other source mechanisms .",
    "this mismatch reflects a similar problem in the underlying galactic @xmath1-ray spectrum , and suggests that the pionic contribution to the egrb is in fact sub - maximal .",

    "however , in the case of normal galaxies we have a better understanding of what that fraction should be .",
    "that is , we can normalize pionic spectrum to the one of the milky way , and then integrate over the redshift history of sources .",
    "following @xcite ( and references therein ) we set up the normalization by requiring that @xmath154 . with the analytic fit of the shape of the pionic spectrum from @xcite",

    "now we can use equation ( [ eq : gcr_pi_flux ] ) to obtain the pionic spectrum which is plotted on the fig .",

    "we thus see that in a completely model - independent analysis , current observations allow the possibility that sfcrs are quite a significant source of 6 and of @xmath1-rays .",
    "indeed , we can not exclude that sfcr - produced lithium can be a potentially large contaminant of the pre - galactic li component of halo stars , which would exacerbate the already troublesome disagreement with cmb - based estimates of primordial 7 .",
    "consequently , we conclude that models for sfcr acceleration and propagation should include both @xmath1-ray and 6 production ; and more constraints on sfcr , both theoretically ( e.g. , space and time histories ) and observationally ( e.g. , egrb and possibly diffuse synchrotron measurement ) , will clarify the picture we have sketched .",
    "note that had we also considered the possibility of depletion of 6 , we would have found a greater 6 residual , and thus had an even larger sfcr - produced component .",
    "in this section we turn to the as - yet unobserved cosmological component of cosmic rays , and to the synthesis of lithium by sfcr .",
    "this lithium component would be the first made after big bang nucleosynthesis .",

    "this structure - formation li would be an additional `` contaminant '' to the usual components in halo stars , the 7 abundance due to primordial nucleosynthesis , and the 6 and 7 contribution due to galactic cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "moreover , the pre - galactic but non - primordial component would by itself be indistinguishable from the true primordial component , and thus would lead to an overestimate of the bbn 7 production .",
    "our goal in this section is to exploit the @xmath1-ray connection to constrain the structure - formation li contamination .",

    "the situation is somewhat better if the pre - galactic sfcr production is at low redshift , but here it is hard to understand how this would predate the halo star component of our galaxy .",
    "the high - redshift result is thus the more likely one , but also somewhat troubling in that the limit is not constraining .",
    "the indirect limits on sfcr li in the previous section are somewhat stronger , but these also hold the door open for a significant level of pre - galactic synthesis .",
    "we caution that the lack of a strong constraint on sfcr li production is not the same as positive evidence that the production was large .",
    "recall that we have made several assumptions which purposely maximize the sfcr contribution ; to the extent that these assumptions fail , the contribution falls , perhaps drastically . a more detailed theoretical and observational understanding of the sfcr history , and of the egrb , will help to clarify this situation .",
    "moreover , given that the halo star li is already found to be below the cmb - based 7 bbn results , we are already strongly biased to believe that the pre - galactic sfcr component is _ not _ very large . thus one might be tempted instead to go the other way and use li abundances to constrain sfcr activity .",
    "we thus now go the other way and use solar 6 to constrain the sfcr @xmath1-ray flux . again , given our incomplete knowledge of sfcrs , we must adopt a simplifying assumption about the degree of 6 production which is due to sfcr . to be conservative",

    "<S> we find that the solar 6 abundance demands an accompanying extragalactic pionic @xmath1-ray intensity which exceeds that of the _ entire _ observed egrb by a factor of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we then constrain li production using recent determinations of extragalactic @xmath1-ray background ( egrb ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that cosmic rays created during cosmic structure formation would lead to pre - galactic li production , which would act as a `` contaminant '' to the primordial 7 content of metal - poor halo stars ; the egrb can place an upper limit on this contamination if we attribute the entire egrb pionic contribution to structure forming cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the uncertainties in the determination of the egrb are so large that the present @xmath1-ray data can not guarantee that the pre - galactic li is small compared to primordial 7 ; thus , an improved determination of the egrb will shed important new light on this issue . </S>",
    "<S> our limits and their more model - dependent extensions will improve significantly with additional observations of 6 in halo stars , and with improved measurements of the egrb spectrum by glast . </S>"
