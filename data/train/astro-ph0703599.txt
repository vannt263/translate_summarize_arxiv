    "in contrast , the merger of a ns with a stellar - mass bh ( @xmath7 ) makes it possible for the ns to be disrupted outside the bh s innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , and this will potentially enrich the gw signal with a lot of information on the detailed behavior of the ns matter . even though the gw signals from the inspiral of ns ",
    "ns binaries are accessible to ground - based interferometers , covering the frequency range @xmath8hz , the signals from their final mergers will probably be lost in the high - frequency noise level @xcite . on the other hand , the gw merger signals for typical bh  ns binaries with stellar - mass bhs",
    "are expected to lie well within the sensitivity band of ligo , at frequencies @xmath9hz .",
    "although double ns binaries have been observed @xcite , bh  ns and bh  bh binaries remain undetected . moreover , the few observed ns ",
    "ns binaries ( binary pulsars with ns companions and one double pulsar ) are subject to considerable selection effects .",
    "therefore it is not currently possible to infer much empirically about the general properties of dcos based on the observed sample .",
    "theorists rely instead on binary evolution and population synthesis models to make predictions about the formation , evolution and properties of such binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models give estimates of merger rates for dcos and the corresponding detection rates for the various gw interferometers .",

    ". one should remember that , although the merger rates for ns ",
    "ns binaries have been empirically constrained @xcite , no such constraints have been set for bh  bh and bh  ns mergers .",
    "the lack of complete understanding of binary star evolution can lead to merger rate estimates for these systems which vary significantly , depending on the exact physical assumptions adopted in the various binary evolution codes .",
    "current effort is focusing on decreasing these uncertainties and setting more solid constraints on the merger rates of bh  ns and bh  bh binaries @xcite .",
    "along with the binary evolution studies that provide merger rates of compact binaries , general relativistic calculations of binary mergers try to guide the search for gw signals by predicting the exact shape of the signals and generating gw search templates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "for bh  ns and bh  bh binaries it is expected that both the bh spins and their possible misalignment angle with respect to the orbital angular momentum will affect significantly the shape of the gw signals and their detectability @xcite .      another interesting aspect of bh  ns and ns ",
    "ns binaries is their possible connection to the observed short gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "this hypothesis has gained widespread support over the last few years , both because of the rapid progress in theoretical modelling and from the recent _ swift _ observations of short grbs ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "grbs are classified into two duration classes , separated at @xmath17s ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "long bursts are found to be predominantly in active star - forming regions .",
    "it is now believed that long bursts are produced when a massive star reaches the end of its life , its core collapsing to form a bh and , in the process , ejecting an ultra - relativistic outflow ( e.g. , woosley & bloom 2006 ) .",
    "the standard collapsar model predicts that a broad - lined and luminous type i - c core collapse supernova ( sn ) accompanies long bursts ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "this association has been confirmed in observations of several nearby grbs ( e.g. , galama et al .",
    "1998 ; hjorth et al .  2003 ; pian et al .  2006",
    "; gehrels et al .  2006 ) .",
    "until recently , afterglow of short bursts have been extremely elusive .",
    "this situation changed dramatically in 2005 .",
    "_ swift _ and _ hete-2 _ detected x - ray afterglows from short bursts ( gehrels et al .  2005 ; villasenor et al .",
    "this has led to the identification of host galaxies and to redshift measurements .",
    "more than 10 short burst afterglows have been detected so far , and distinctive features have emerged .",
    "while long bursts occur only in star forming spiral galaxies , short bursts appear also in elliptical galaxies , which are dominated by an old stellar population .",
    "the low level of star formation makes it unlikely that the bursts originated in a sn explosion .",
    "even though a short burst , grb 050709 , was seen in a galaxy with current star formation , optical observations ruled out a sn association ( fox et al .",
    "the isotropic energy for short bursts is 2 - 3 orders of magnitude lower than that for long bursts @xmath18erg ( barthelmy et al .",
    "these results suggest that compact stellar mergers are the progenitors of short bursts .",
    "the similarity of x - ray afterglow light curves of long and short bursts indicates that afterglows of both classes can be described by the same paradigm , despite the differences in the progenitors .",
    "this view is supported by the fact that the decay rate of short burst afterglows is the value expected from the standard fireball model ( e.g. , piran 2004 ; mszros 2006 ) , and that at least in two short bursts ( grb 050709 and grb 01221a ) there is evidence for a jet break ( fox et al .",
    "2005 ; soderberg et al .  2006 ; burrows et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the standard afterglow model ,",
    "these breaks are interpreted as a signature of collimation of a fireball into a jet with an opening angle @xmath19 degrees and imply a beaming - corrected energy of @xmath20erg , much less than that of long bursts , which have @xmath21erg ( frail et al .",
    "the lower energy implies that the mass of the debris torus formed during the merger could be smaller than that of the torus formed in the collapse of the core of massive stars .",
    "combined with the lack of a jet break in grb 050724 , which gives lower limits of @xmath22 degrees and @xmath23erg ( grupe et al .",
    "2006 ) , the current small sample indicates that the outflow of short bursts is less strongly collimated than most previously reported long grbs with the median value @xmath24 degrees ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ; however see monfardini et al .",
    "the wider jet angle is consistent with a merger progenitor scenario ( e.g. , mszros , rees & wijers 1999 ) , since there is no extended massive stellar envelope ( as in long grbs ) that serves to naturally collimate the outflow .",
    "many more bright short bursts will be needed to improve the jet break statistics substantially .",
    "one of the unexpected results from _ swift _ is that early x - ray afterglows of long bursts show a canonical behavior , where light curves include three components : ( 1 ) a steep decay component , ( 2 ) a shallow decay component and ( 3 ) a `` normal '' decay component . on top of this canonical behavior , many events have superimposed x - ray flares ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "the x - ray afterglow of a short burst , grb 050724 , associated with an elliptical host galaxy , also resembles the canonical light curve , and it suggests a long - lasting engine .",
    "a flare at @xmath25s in the x - ray light curve decays too sharply to be interpreted as the afterglow emission from a forward shock , but is consistent with the high latitude emission from a fireball ( barthelmy et al .",
    "2005 ; kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "this is appropriate for the late internal shock scenario as invoked to interpret x - ray flares in long grbs .",
    "this interpretation requires that the central engine remains active up to at least @xmath26s , and challenges simple merger models , because the predicted typical time scale for energy release is much shorter .",
    "another interesting scenario based on bh  ns and ns ",
    "ns mergers and connected to grbs is the production of r - process elements ( heavy nuclei with @xmath27 ) through the nuclear physics of decompressed ns matter in the ejecta produced by the merger .",
    "it is still not clear today what is the astrophysical site that can provide the appropriate conditions for r - process nucleosynthesis to take place , although the conditions themselves can be estimated @xcite .",
    "the possible ejection of extremely neutron - rich ( @xmath28 ) material from ns disruptions in compact binary mergers is believed to be a promising source for r - process elements @xcite .",
    "as such mergers are expected to happen in the outskirts of galaxies @xcite , it is possible that the high - velocity ejecta will also enrich the intergalactic medium with high mass r - process elements @xcite .      in recent years , various groups have performed 3-d hydrodynamic simulations of bh - ns mergers , providing very interesting  if somewhat preliminary  results . in parallel with this work",
    "there has been an ongoing effort to improve both the computational techniques and the overall accuracy of the merger simulations .",
    "newtonian studies of bh ",
    "ns mergers , where the bh is simply represented by a point mass , were first used by different groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to cover a fairly wide range of mass ratios while attempting to determine the merger s dependence on the ns eos .",
    "the general picture that comes out of these newtonian calculations is a clear connection between mass ratio and ns eos , and the ability to form a massive enough accretion disk around the bh at the end of the merger . as an overall trend , for higher mass ratios ( with @xmath29 ) the survival of ns material and formation of a disk around a schwarzschild bh seems possible for soft eos .",
    "for these high mass ratio mergers the tidal disruption radius lies outside the isco , which allows for more ns material to settle into a disk after the tidal disruption .",
    "however , those studies also suggested that , for a stiffer eos , the core of the ns always survives the merger , inhibiting the formation of a massive disk around the bh and leading instead to a period of quasi - stable mass transfer from the ns to the bh @xcite .",
    "a stiffer eos could , in that case , prevent the total disruption of the ns , leading to the eventual formation of a `` mini - ns '' along with the disk or even lead to multiple disruptions of the surviving ns core .",
    "@xcite suggested that the survival of a mini - ns for the case of a stiff polytropic eos ( @xmath30 ) is connected to the difficulty of forming a massive disk in their calculations , arguing that the survival of an orbiting ns core acts as a storage mechanism that prevents further inflow of material towards the bh .    in their full - gr treatment of bh ",
    "ns mergers for a non - spinning bh of arbitrary mass , @xcite concluded that the disruption of a ns by a low - mass bh ( @xmath31 ) can lead to the formation of a low - mass disk ( of mass @xmath32 ) around the bh , which could potentially power a short grb .",
    "no formation of more massive disks was ever observed in their simulations , indicating that systems with @xmath33 disks around a bh can not be formed through bh ",
    "ns mergers with non - spinning bhs .",
    "survival of a ns core , or quasi - stable mass transfer , as predicted by newtonian calculations , are never seen in these full - gr calculations .",
    "also limited to schwarzschild bhs , the fully relativistic calculations of @xcite focused on bh ",
    "ns mergers with a much more extreme mass ratio @xmath34 .",
    "for such a mass ratio and a non - spinning bh , the tidal disruption limit of a ns with canonical mass and radius ( i.e. , compactness ratio @xmath35 ) is reached inside the isco .",
    "for this reason , @xcite considered artificially undercompact models for the ns ( with compactness as small as @xmath36 ) , in order to study cases where the disruption of the ns takes place outside the isco .",
    "they suggested that their study for these undecompact nss can serve as an analogue for binaries with lower - mass bhs and more compact nss ( which their numerical code could not handle directly ) , where the tidal radius is located well outside the isco .",
    "they found that only a small fraction ( @xmath37 ) of the ns mass becomes unbound and escapes from the system and that , while most of the infalling mass is accreted promptly by the bh , part of it ( @xmath38 ) remains bound outside the horizon , forming a disk .",
    "motivated by all these recent observational and theoretical developments , we have embarked on a new numerical investigation of the merger process for bh ",
    "ns binaries using a 3-d relativistic sph code developed specifically for the study of stellar disruptions by bhs . in this paper ,",
    "the first of a series , we present our methods and numerical code , as well as the results from a first set of preliminary calculations aimed at exploring broadly the parameter space of these mergers .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in  2 we describe the sph code used for our simulations ; we develop some analytic considerations regarding the metric used by the code ; and we also discuss the various test calculations that we have performed . in ",
    "3 we present results from our simulations of equatorial mergers (  3.1 ) and inclined mergers (  3.2 ) , including a discussion of how to set up initial conditions for the inclined case .",
    "the gw signals extracted from these simulations are presented and discussed in  4 .",
    "finally , a summary and conclusions are given in  5 .",
    "fig .  [ rl ] shows why the final merger of a bh ",
    "ns binary ( for a typical stellar - mass bh ) is interesting but also particularly difficult to compute : the tidal ( roche ) limit is typically right around the isco and the bh horizon . on the one hand , this implies that careful , fully relativistic calculations are needed . on the other hand ,",
    "it also means that the fluid behavior and the gw signals could depend sensitively ( and carry rich information ) on both the masses and spins of the compact objects , and on the ns eos .",
    "how much information is carried about the fluid depends on where exactly the tidal disruption of the ns occurs : for a sufficiently massive bh , the horizon will always be encountered well outside the tidal limit , in which case the ns behavior remains point - like throughout the merger and disruption will never be observed . in the opposite case where the tidal limit resides outside the horizon",
    ", the gw signal corresponding to the ns disruption could be detected by ground - based interferometers .",
    "for those cases where disruption occurs outside the bh s horizon , the final outcome of the merger depends strongly on the relative positions of the tidal radius @xmath39 ( i.e. , the point where disruption takes place ) to the isco of the bh .",
    "[ rl ] gives an overview of these critical radii and a first idea of what one could expect the outcome to be for mergers with various mass ratios .",
    "an interesting fact that we notice first is that for a given bh mass the relative position of @xmath39 to the isco changes with the bh s angular momentum : as the bh spin increases , it drags the isco closer to the bh . for high enough mass ratios ( low bh mass of the order of a few @xmath40 ) the tidal radius",
    "is always encountered outside the isco , even for non - rotating bhs . for a @xmath41 bh ,",
    "the isco and @xmath39 coincide for a schwarzschild bh , but the isco moves inside @xmath39 for a kerr ( spinning ) bh .",
    "finally , for even higher mass bhs of @xmath42 the situation becomes more interesting as the isco lies well outside the tidal radius for a non - spinning bh and for kerr bhs with low spin , but it starts migrating inside @xmath39 as the bh s angular momentum increases . for fast spinning bhs the tidal radius is encountered well outside the isco .",
    "of course for very massive bhs , @xmath39 is not only inside the isco but inside the horizon as well , even for the case of an extremal kerr bh ( this happens for @xmath43 ) .",
    "these simple results are important because disruption outside the isco could lead to the formation of a disk of ns debris outside the bh s horizon .",
    "if the disruption is to happen inside the isco , no such feature is expected . knowing the relative position of isco and @xmath39 for various binary mass ratios therefore gives us a first insight on what to expect as the qualitative outcome of a merger , and in which ranges of mass ratios we should look for certain outcomes .",
    "the sph code makes use of the kerr - schild ( k - s ) form of the kerr metric . in this section",
    "we summarize the reasons for choosing to use the k - s metric ( i.e. , its advantages over the kerr metric in boyer - lindquist [ b - l ] coordinates ) and how quantities such as the bh horizons and the angular velocity of equatorial circular orbits around the bh translate from one coordinate system to the other .",
    "the reader can find extensive discussions of the b - l and k - s coordinate systems in , e.g. , @xcite . here",
    "we present a brief overview with emphasis on some useful aspects of the k - s metric that relate directly to our calculations and to the presentation of our numerical results .",
    "the kerr solution in b - l coordinates is given by the familiar expressions @xcite",
    "@xmath44 + ( r^2+a^2+^2)^2d^2-d dt [ kerrbl ]    where = r^2 - 2mr+a^2 = r^2+a^2 ^ 2 .",
    "this form has only one off - diagonal term and is therefore far more convenient to use than the k - s form of the metric . :",
    "@xmath45 yet , it carries some extra coordinate singularities which correspond to the roots of @xmath46 : @xmath47 ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the future and past horizons respectively , with @xmath48 only being an event horizon ) .",
    "it is useful to observe that : ( a ) for @xmath50 the two coordinate singularities ( horizons ) coincide , ( b ) for @xmath51 there is only one horizon at @xmath52 and the curvature singularity at @xmath53 .",
    "the obvious advantage of casting the kerr metric into its k - s form is that one avoids the coordinate singularities at the horizon present in b - l coordinates .",
    "the coordinate singularity at the horizon present in the b - l form of the metric has the following effect @xcite : although it takes a finite proper time for a particle to cross the event horizon , it takes infinite coordinate time @xmath54 to do so .",
    "moreover , since the angular velocity @xmath55 tends to a finite limit at the horizon , @xmath56 has also to increase an infinite amount : @xmath57 ( @xmath56 , like @xmath54 , is not a  good \" coordinate at the horizon ) .",
    "what this practically means for our code is that it prevents us from extending our calculations all the way to the horizon of the bh . in that case",
    ", one needs instead to place an absorbing boundary outside the bh s horizon .",
    "fortunately there is a way to overcome this problem . in order to extend the kerr metric beyond the horizon",
    ", another coordinate system needs to be adopted . keeping in mind that the horizons are null surfaces",
    ", it makes intuitively sense to construct the new coordinates in terms of null geodesics .",
    "the null geodesics in the kerr spacetime are given by the tangent vectors = e = e = 0 [ kerr_nulls]=e where @xmath58 is the specific energy .",
    "the real null vector @xmath59 reads :    l^=(r^2+a^2,,0,a).setting @xmath60 ( and using @xmath61 for the affine parameter )    = , = 1 ,    = 0 , = .    by choosing the positive sign for @xmath62",
    "we obtain an outgoing congruence with the tangent vector field defined by l^ _ = _ t+_r+ _",
    ".the new variables @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be introduced in the place of @xmath54 and @xmath56 : du = dt - drd = d - dr [ out_cong ] .",
    "the null geodesic now becomes l^=(0,1,0,0)and the metric takes the form    @xmath65 + ( ^2+a^2+)^2d^2 [ outks ]    where @xmath66 is defined by ) would be @xmath67 ] ^4-(^2-a^2)^2-a^2z^2=0 [ ksr]with , @xmath68 . ] ^2=x^2+y^2+z^2 .    by instead choosing the negative sign for @xmath62 we can obtain an ingoing congruence with the tangent vector field given by l^ _ = _",
    "t-_r+_.the new variables to be introduced here are dv = dt+drd=d+dr [ in_cong ] . in this coordinate system",
    "the null geodesic simplifies to l^=(0,-1,0,0 )    and the metric becomes    @xmath69 + ( ^2+a^2+)^2d^2 [ inks ] .",
    "what is the use of those two different coordinate sets ?",
    "the coordinates ( @xmath70,@xmath71,@xmath72,@xmath73 ) are well behaved on the future horizon , yet they are singular on the past horizon , where ( @xmath63,@xmath71,@xmath72,@xmath64 ) are now well behaved .",
    "therefore the first set of coordinates is used in order to regularize the past horizon , whereas the second one is used to regularize the future horizon .",
    "if one wants to avoid both horizons of a kerr bh , both patches need to be used in order to cover the entire spacetime around the bh .",
    "then there is just the curvature singularity of the kerr metric left , which occurs at = ^2+a^2 ^ 2 = 0 , implying x^2+y^2=a^2 .",
    "the curvature singularity is not a point but rather a ring of radius @xmath1 and exists only in the equatorial plane .",
    "it is always found inside the past horizon , although as @xmath74 decreases the curvature singularity and the past horizon approach each other ( fig .",
    "[ horizons ] ) .",
    "we employ a 3-d implementation of the lagrangian sph technique .",
    "our grsph ( general relativistic smooth particle hydrodynamics ) code is based on the work by laguna et al .",
    "( 1993a ) in which the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations were rewritten in a lagrangian form similar to their counterparts for non - relativistic fluids with newtonian self - gravity .",
    "the grsph code is restricted to _ fixed curved spacetimes _ ; in particular , the spacetime of a rotating bh is assumed here .",
    "the use of a fixed background in our simulations is justified for low mass ratios ( @xmath75 in this paper ) , i.e. , when the mass of the bh is substantially larger than the ns mass .",
    "originally the bh metric used in the code was in terms of boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "for the present work , we use kerr - schild coordinates .",
    "the main advantage of these coordinates is their regularity across the bh horizon , thus allowing sph particles to freely cross it .",
    "an important aspect of sph in curved spacetimes is the handling of the local volume - averaging required by the smoothing of the equations .",
    "the smoothing volumes involved are in general not small enough to ignore curvature effects , especially in the neighborhood of the bh .",
    "our implementation correctly accounts for these effects .",
    "the most important computational aspect of the grsph code is the particle neighbor finding algorithm .",
    "the grsph code uses an _ oct - tree _ data structure as basis for finding neighbors @xcite .",
    "the oct - tree neighbor - searching part of grsph has also been successfully used for @xmath76-body large - scale structure simulations @xcite and is used as the foundation of a different sph code with radiation transport used for supernova core collapse calculations @xcite .",
    "the grsph code scales as @xmath77 with @xmath76 the total number of sph particles .",
    "the code was calibrated with three one - dimensional benchmarks ( laguna et al .",
    "1993 ) : ( 1 ) relativistic shock tubes , ( 2 ) dust infall onto a bh , and ( 3 ) bondi collapse ( see laguna et al .",

    "artificial viscosity is implemented in our code by following the description presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "artificial viscosity is a mechanism to account for the possible presence of shocks and is introduced as a viscous pressure term added to the sph equations @xcite .",
    "as we do not expect any shocks to appear in our simulations except perhaps at the point where the stream of ns material accreting onto the bh self - intersects , we keep artificial viscosity suppressed by lowering the parameters of its two terms ( the bulk viscosity term and the von neumann - richtmyer ( 1950 ) viscosity term ) to the value @xmath78 instead of the more common values @xmath79 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) to derive a damping force ( eq .  6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for each sph particle .",
    "the formula has been slightly modified as in our code we deal with @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the 4-velocity .",
    "we have also added a parameter to increase the radiation reaction force in order to accelerate the initial inspiral since we do not want to spend too much computational time on this initial phase .",

[ horizons ] ) at @xmath83 , and as a result , we see the orbits of the sph particles being trapped at @xmath83 . to check that it is the inner horizon where our transformation is singular",
    ", we set up the following simple test : we construct a test particle geodesic integrator that makes use of the k - s metric and we start with an equatorial orbit for @xmath50 which , starting from a finite distance from the bh ( having @xmath84 ) , ends being trapped at @xmath83 .",
    "we then keep following the same orbit as we reduce the value of @xmath1 ( fig .",

    "we find that the outcome of the merger depends strongly on the spin of the bh and the inclination of the orbit .",
    "more specifically , for equatorial mergers , the survival of ns material is possible only for mergers with @xmath190 and , in that case , the percentage of surviving material increases with increasing bh spin , varying from about @xmath128 to @xmath191 for @xmath74 decreasing from 0.99 to 0.7 .",

    "the outcome of inclined mergers ( for fixed @xmath85 ) shows strong dependence on the value of the inclination angle . for sufficiently low inclinations ( @xmath194 )",
    "there is always a large fraction of the ns mass surviving the merger , up to @xmath195 , depending on the inclination angle .",
    "moreover , for these mergers the formation of a thick stable torus of substantial bound mass is also strongly inclination - dependent . whenever the inclination exceeds @xmath196 the fraction of bound material drops to levels unresolvable by our present calculations , although there is still a significant fraction ( @xmath197 ) of the material that is being ejected .",
    "given the sensitive dependence of our results on the bh spin , one might wonder whether the accretion of ns material onto the bh could lead to significant spin up , with a corresponding change in the spacetime metric which is not accounted for in our sph code ( where the bh spin parameter is assumed fixed during the entire evolution ) .",
    "for each one of the runs presented in  3 we have calculated the change in the bh spin by adding to the initial angular momentum of the bh the angular momentum of the total accreted mass ( _ a posteriori _ ) . for runs e1-e5 the total change in the bh spin after the accretion was less than @xmath198 .",

    "the change in the final bh spin varies between @xmath203 for a non - spinning bh and @xmath204 for a bh with initial @xmath134 . even for these cases",
    "the change in the bh spin will not alter the result of the merger , as all simulations with bh spin @xmath205 resulted in the accretion of the entire ns mass by the bh .",
    "another possible caveat concerns our newtonian treatment of the ns fluid self - gravity .",
    "we should stress here the point made already in @xcite , that a more accurate , relativistic treatment of the ns fluid s self - gravity could lead to even faster mass transfer to the bh , as it might result in the expansion of the ns on a dynamical scale during the mass loss phase .",
    "although this effect could have significant impact on the outcome of some mergers , we have observed in all our simulations that the complete disruption of the ns lasts typically less than one dynamical time from the onset of mass loss and therefore we believe that the adoption of a simple newtonian treatment of self - gravity in our code is justified .",
    "our findings have direct implications for the viability of bh ",

    "the possibility of short grbs being powered by such mergers depends on the characteristics of the binary , mainly the bh spin and the orbital inclination .",

    "ns mergers seem to be promising as progenitors for short grbs , binaries with fast spinning bhs and zero to moderate inclinations appear to form a disk or torus around the bh , massive enough to power a short grb when later accreted by the bh .",

    "ns binaries could be associated with the production of short grbs .",

    "the fact that the short grb progenitors need not belong to a homogeneous group and that ns ",
    "ns binary mergers could be equally viable progenitors of short grbs is also an open issue currently under investigation .",

    "this is to be expected , as for the particular mass ratio ( @xmath206 ) considered in our simulations the tidal limit is found inside the isco for @xmath51 and thus we would not expect to find a stable disk forming around the bh . the ejection of material and the formation of an accretion disk were observed only for mergers with highly spinning bhs .    in paper",
    "ii we will extend our simulations to include different mass ratios , although still in the limit where the use of a fixed background is justified ( i.e. , for bh masses much larger than the ns mass ) , and we will explore the effects of changing the ns eos and relaxing our assumption of an initially synchronized ns . in this context we would like to add a brief comment about the importance of the ns eos for the dynamics of the merger right after the disruption of the ns .",
    "[ forces ] shows the averaged ratio of the pressure gradient forces over the gravity forces as a function of time ( for the run with higher resolution presented in  3.1 ) .",
    "we see clearly that right after the disruption of the ns ( at @xmath207 ) the pressure forces become insignificant and the decompressed ns material essentially follows ballistic trajectories , indicating that the details of the eos no longer play any role . thus one need not worry that the decompressed material should be described by a different eos . only the high - density eos describing the interior of the ns prior to disruption may have a significant effect on the outcome of the merger .",
    "ultimately , the adoption of a full numerical relativistic scheme , where no simplifying assumptions on the background spacetime metric are made , would be ideal , as it would allow us to explore mergers for binaries with higher mass ratios .",
