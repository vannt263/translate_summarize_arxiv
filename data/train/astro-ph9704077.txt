    "starbursts are regions of intense massive star formation that can totally dominate a galaxy s integrated spectrum .",
    "they range in size from giant extragalactic  regions of scale size @xmath8 kpc ( e.g.  ngc  604 in m  33 ) to global bursts ( often in merging systems ) many kpc across that can cover the entire face of the system ( e.g.ngc  4038/4039 , ngc  4449 ) .",
    "there has been much interest in the starburst phenomenon over the past decade or so , yet there is much more to learn . for example we do not know how starbursts are regulated : what turns them on and off , and what keeps them going . also unknown",
    "is how the properties of starbursts vary with size or luminosity .",
    "we address some of these issues in this paper .    while starbursts are worthy of investigation in their own right , they are even more important when placed in the broader context of contemporary extragalactic astrophysics . the cosmological relevance of starbursts has been underscored by the recent discovery of : the existence of a population of high - redshift ( @xmath9 ) uv - bright field galaxies ( cf .",
    "et  al . _  1996a , b ; lowenthal _ et  al",
    "1997 ) . the sheer number density of these galaxies implies that they almost certainly represent precursors of typical present - day galaxies in an early actively - star - forming phase . this discovery moves the study of the star - forming history of the universe into the arena of direct observations ( cf .",
    "et  al . _",
    "1996 ) , and gives added impetus to the quest to understand local starbursts . in particular , a thorough understanding of how to exploit the diagnostic power of the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) properties of local starbursts will give astronomers powerful tools with which to study star - formation in the early universe .",
    "accordingly , we have been using the hst to determine the basic uv structure and morphology of starbursts . in our first paper ( meurer _",
    "et  al . _  1995",
    "; hereafter m95 ) we analyzed in detail uv hst images of nine starburst systems with distances , except where noted . ]",
    "@xmath10 mpc . here",
    ", we turn our gaze outward and consider the uv structure of starbursts from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , in an attempt to document and understand the sytematic properties of starbursts .",
    "we also broaden our net by considering the structural properties of infrared - selected `` dusty '' starbursts .",
    "m95 showed that nearby starbursts are irregular structures consisting of diffusely distributed light interspersed with prominent compact ( radii @xmath13 pc ) star clusters .",
    "numerous other hst studies have also commented on the presence of luminous young star clusters ( including holtzman _",

    "; schweizer _",
    "et  al . _ , 1996 ; watson _",
    "_ , 1996 ) . while the clusters are certainly the most striking aspect of the images , it is the diffuse light that dominates .",
    "m95 find on average 80%  of the uv light is diffusely distributed , and 20%  comes from clusters .",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996a ) find similar fractional uv contributions of clusters in five starburst ring galaxies .",
    "m95 argue that there are two modes of star formation in starbursts : prominent cluster formation , and dominant diffusely distributed star formation .",
    "m95 also noted that the effective surface brightnesses of most of the starbursts in their ( small ) sample span a narrow range of values ( dispersion of 0.4 mag arcsec@xmath14 for 8/11 starburst regions ) .",
    "since starbursts produce the most intense uv emission observed in galaxies , this result implies that there is an upper limit to the uv surface brightness of galaxies .",
    "lehnert &  heckman ( 1996 ) found a similar limit to the far - infrared surface brightness of far - infrared galaxies ( firgs ) . in both samples",
    "the illuminating source can be traced to high - mass stars .",
    "the uv light studied by m95 is dominated by the light from stars with mass @xmath15 20 .",
    "the far - infrared emission studied by lehnert &  heckman is thought to result from dust absorbing uv  optical photons ( which are predominantly produced by high - mass stars ) being heated and reemitting the radiation thermally at infrared wavelengths .",
    "thus firgs are thought to be obscured starbursts .",
    "these surface brightness limits suggest a limit to the intensity of high - mass star formation , which implies that there is a mechanism that limits the global star formation intensity of galaxies .    here",
    "we reexamine the issue of starburst intensities . since selection effects are strongest at low surface brightness , we are primarily interested in the intensity maximum .",
    "our aims are to determine what the starburst intensity limit is , investigate whether it varies with certain parameters , and consider what causes the limit . by comparing starbursts selected and observed at different wavelengths we address the issue of opacity and the difference between dusty and relatively dust free starbursts . by comparing starbursts at different redshifts we are able to consider the evolution of starburst intensities , and the resultant cosmological implications .",
    "our method is to compile observations of a diverse set of starburst samples from the literature , combined with ( a dash of ) new data . after defining some relevant quantities in ",
    "[ s : quant ] we compile three samples of starburst data : i.  a sample of starbursts observed in the rest - frame vacuum ultraviolet (  [ s : uvsamp ] ) ; ii .  a sample observed in the far - infrared and  (  [ s : oirsamp ] ) ; and iii .  a sample observed at radio wavelengths (  [ s : radsamp ] ) . in ",
    "[ s : caveats ] we discuss the selection effects and measurement biases , and estimate the level of agreement we expect between intrinsically similar samples . in ",
    "[ s : disc ] we discuss the interpretation of the results and their implications , and  [ s : conc ] summarizes the conclusions .",
    "to quantify the intensity of high - mass star formation we measure the surface brightness at a wavelength that traces high - mass stars , within an aperture that encompasses half of the _ total _ emission from the starburst .",
    "thus we employ the effective , or half light , radius @xmath16 , and effective surface brightness @xmath0 enclosed within @xmath16 .",
    "these quantities are best measured with a curve of growth extracted from a background - subtracted image of the starburst .",
    "relative to the total luminosity @xmath17 , the effective surface brightness is given by : @xmath18 note that the definition of surface brightness used by lehnert & heckman ( 1996 ) is a factor of two higher than our definition .",
    "their definition is equivalent to saying that all of the starburst is located within the half light radius of the tracer .",
    "here we assume a one - to - one spatial relationship between the high - mass stars and their trace emission .",
    "one complication is that the apertures used to measure @xmath16 are often elliptical , not circular , in shape .",
    "our approach is to take @xmath16 as the geometric equivalent radius of the aperture : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the semimajor axis length of the elliptical aperture enclosing half the the total flux , and @xmath21 is the corresponding axial ratio at @xmath20 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath16 and @xmath0 are global quantities ; that is they are associated with the total light of the starburst .",
    "this includes both clusters and diffuse light .",
    "furthermore the area over which the @xmath0 is measured scales with the distribution of the light . for moderate to high redshift galaxies full cosmological corrections",
    "have been applied to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 measurements assuming an open universe with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    the salient properties of starbursts are essentially defined by ionizing stars .",
    "these have masses @xmath24 , and hence lifetimes @xmath25 myr .",
    "ideally we would like to determine how these stars are distributed .",
    "however , the size of the ionizing source distribution is not directly observable since either very little ionizing emission escapes from starbursts , or it is absorbed by the local ism / igm before reaching the earth ( leitherer _ et  al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath16 of some other tracer of the ionizing population is employed : the vacuum - uv ( sample i ) ,  ( sample ii ) , and 21 cm continuum radio emission ( sample iii ) . to compare results",
    "we convert all flux related measurements to bolometric quantities .",
    "the algorithms we use are given below .",
    "to characterize the @xmath0 distribution of a sample we consider the sample median and 90th percentiles , which we denote as @xmath26 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the samples were compiled from a hodge - podge of studies with selection criteria and measurement techniques varying from study to study .",
    "in addition , there is a well known bias when observing extended objects to observe those with the highest surface brightness ( e.g.  disney 1976 ; mcgaugh _ et  al . _  1995 ) , so the lower percentiles of the @xmath0 distributions are likely to be rather incomplete .",
    "this is especially true for starbursts which are often recognized by their high surface brightness .",
    "therefore , @xmath26 and @xmath2 should not be interpreted too literally .",
    "they actually represent upper limits to the true median and 90th percentiles of the @xmath0 distributions of star forming galaxies . here",
    "@xmath26 should be interpreted as the typical surface brightness selected in a sample , and @xmath2 should be interpreted as close to the highest surface brightness found by a given technique . in  [ s : caveats ] we discuss the selection effects and biases of the samples and estimate the level of agreement we expect .",
    "there are many appealing reasons to observe starbursts in the vacuum - uv ( see m95 ) .",
    "however , there is one serious hindrance to interpreting the results : dust .",
    "it efficiently extincts and scatters uv radiation . when dust absorbs uv and optical photons it heats up and reemits the radiation thermally in the far - infrared .",
    "the redistribution of radiant energy must be well modeled and corrected for in order to determine the true bolometric luminosity of a starburst .",
    "m95 showed that it is possible to do just that using only the uv properties of starbursts .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : uvir ] which is adapted from fig .",
    "it shows the ratio of far - infrared ( fir ) flux @xmath27 to uv flux @xmath28 compared to the spectral slope @xmath29 which is a measure of the ultraviolet color , for a sample of uv - selected starbursts .",
    "the definitions of these quantities are given below (  [ s : irmeth ] ,  [ s : uvmeth ] ) and in m95 .",
    "in this plot the @xmath30 axis quantifies the redistribution of spectral energy from the uv to the fir .",
    "a strong relationship is apparent in this diagram - in the sense that , as relatively more light is emitted in the fir , the starbursts become redder .",
    "note that the hatched region in this plot shows the expected range of colors for naked ionizing populations .",
    "all the galaxies in this plot display strong recombination emission spectra , hence their intrinsic colors should be that of an ionizing population .",
    "figure  [ f : uvir ] then indicates that reddening is positively correlated with dust extinction .",
    "such a correlation is a major prediction of simple foreground screen models for dust extinction . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ f : uvir ] shows the expected relationship for a starburst having @xmath31 and foreground screen dust having the calzetti _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1994 ; hereafter c94 ) `` extinction law '' .",
    "details of the model can be found in m95 .",
    "figure  [ f : uvir ] shows that a foreground screen dust geometry models well the redistribution of spectral energy from the uv to the fir .",
    "similar results have been noted by calzetti _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996 ) and lehnert &  heckman ( 1996 ) .",
    "however , dust in the vicinity of starbursts does not necessarily have such a simple distribution in all cases .",
    "the rms in @xmath32 about the model line of @xmath33 dex is probably larger than the errors , and may be indicative of the non - uniform nature of the dust distribution ( e.g.  dust lanes ) .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ f : uvir ] plots only uv - selected starbursts , which preferentially will have little extinction .",
    "the point is that the tight empirical relation between uv color and infrared to uv flux ratio shown in fig .",
    "[ f : uvir ] gives us a method to remove the effects of dust extinction for uv - selected starbursts .",
    "we adopt the c94 curve in fig .",
    "[ f : uvir ] because it is physically plausible and goes through the data fairly well .",
    "whether or not the details of this model are absolutely correct is irrelevant , as long as this empirical relationship holds for all uv - selected starbursts",
    ". other plausible fits through the data could also be used , and they will yield the same uv correction factor as we derive to within 0.4 dex .      in all cases measurements of @xmath17 , @xmath16 , and thus @xmath0 have been made from hst images obtained in the rest frame uv . in order to make extinction and @xmath34 corrections it is crucial to measure the uv color , or equivalently the uv spectral slope , since the observed uv continuum spectra of starbursts are well fit by a power law of index @xmath29 : @xmath35 ( c94 , m95 ) . here",
    "@xmath36 is the spectral flux density per wavelength interval . in order to compare the subsamples we reference all observations to the observations of m95 .",
    "these employed the _",
    "faint object camera _ with f220w filter , which has central wavelength @xmath37 .",
    "the total flux is given as @xmath38 .",
    "the methods used to estimate @xmath29 vary from subsample to subsample , and are described below .    the first step in converting the uv to a bolometric flux is to apply ( where appropriate ) the @xmath34 correction : @xmath39 here @xmath40 corresponds to the central wavelength of the filters used below . after correcting for galactic foreground extinction ,",
    "the uv fluxes were then corrected for intrinsic extinction using the c94 model line in fig .  [",
    "f : uvir ] as discussed above .",
    "this model yields the intrinsic extinction @xmath41 following the algorithm in m95 . for this model",
    "a change in spectral slope @xmath42 corresponds to @xmath43 mag for small @xmath44 .",
    "we use the population models of leitherer &  heckman ( 1995 ; hereafter lh95 ) to convert from intrinsic f220w flux / luminosity to bolometric flux .",
    "we assume that starbursts are well represented by a solar metallicity 10 myr duration constant star formation rate population having a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function ( imf ) spanning the mass range of 0.1 to 100 .",
    "the 10 myr duration is meant to represent the typical crossing time of a starburst as estimated by m95 .",
    "although longer durations are likely in the largest starbursts , the uv properties will be dominated by the stars less than 10 myr old . in any case",
    "the choice of a particular age has only a minor effect on the determination of bolometric quantities .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f : bcev ] which shows the evolution of @xmath45 at solar metallicity for both instantaneous burst and constant star formation rate populations for this imf slope ( see m95 and lh95 to see the evolution of the numerator and denominator separately ) . for our adopted population model",
    ", @xmath46 figure  [ f : bcev ] shows that for this imf slope the adopted bolometric correction is accurate to about 20%  or better for instantaneous burst populations less than 10 myr old ( i.e. ,  ionizing bursts ) and constant star formation rate populations over the full age range shown .",
    "for our adopted starburst population parameters the mass to light ratio is @xmath47 and the relationship between star formation rate @xmath48 and @xmath49 is @xmath50 where the luminosity is referenced to @xmath51 , the bolometric luminosity of the sun ( allen , 1973 ) .",
    "the conversions of light to mass ( eq .  [ e : mlrat ] ) and star formation rate ( eq .",
    "[ e : lbolsfr ] ) are much more dependent on the imf parameters and adopted star formation history than the bolometric correction ( eq .  [ e : bcuv ] ) , hence our mass and star formation rate estimates should be considered indicative only .",
    "( i.a ) local uv - selected starbursts are represented by the m95 dataset , where the results are derived from hst faint object camera ( foc ) images obtained with the f220w filter .",
    "total fluxes and effective radii were determined for the eleven starburst regions observed in nine galaxies ( there are three detached regions in their ngc  3690 image ) .",
    "the sample is at sufficiently small redshift that @xmath34 corrections are unnecessary .",
    "the galactic foreground extinction is taken from burstein &  heiles ( 1984 ) , and removed from the uv following the extinction curve of seaton ( 1979 ) using the algorithm given by m95 .",
    "the @xmath29 values were measured from _ international ultraviolet explorer _",

    "the two galaxies were observed with the hst using the foc and the f342w filter ( @xmath53 ) , which has a central wavelength in the rest frame of the galaxies ( @xmath54  ) , very similar to that of the f220w filter . the @xmath34 corrections ( eq .  [ e : kcorr ] ) , although small ( @xmath55 mag ) , were applied .",
    "both galaxies consist of three closely spaced knots aligned nearly linearly .",

    "16 of m95 ) , whereas the extinction correction for this @xmath29 is a factor of eight in the f220w band .",
    "hence , post - bursts would have been that much brighter when they were ionizing populations , and such ultra - luminous starbursts are not detected at high-@xmath6 .",
    "more worrisome is contamination by extended duration star forming populations .",
    "however , durations longer than 300 myr are required to reach the median @xmath29 even if the imf slope is @xmath216 ( lh95 ) .",
    "if contamination is severe we would have the curious effect that @xmath0 and @xmath29 evolution `` conspire '' to mimic no evolution and a simple extinction correction .",

    "they note that these values are underestimates because ( 1 ) they do not sample the full luminosity function , ( 2 ) they represent only the least dusty systems , and ( 3 ) they assume no dust extinction in their analysis .",
    "we can improve on their work by correcting their results for the median @xmath220 mag extinction seen in starbursts .",
    "this yields @xmath221 for the above three redshifts . strictly speaking these results are still lower limits to the true @xmath222 of the universe .",

    "all data points are shown as lower limits : the high-@xmath6 data because completeness corrections still have not been addressed ; and the data with @xmath227 because they have not been corrected for extinction .",
    "if the extinction correction to the other points is small , then our new estimates suggest that the epoch of peak galaxy formation may be as early as @xmath4 .",
    "clearly much work needs to be done to put all estimates of @xmath222 on the same scale .",
    "our new estimates of @xmath222 are well above the mean metal ejection rate of the universe @xmath228 ( madau _ et  al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "strictly speaking it too is a lower limit , since it neglects low surface brightness galaxies and intergalactic and intracluster gas in the estimation .",
    "mushotzky &  loewenstein ( 1997 ) provide an estimate of @xmath229 in the redshift interval @xmath230 to 6  the epoch of elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "this level is plotted as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ f : metalprod ] . in madau _",
    "et  al . _  it seemed possible that the universe was relatively quiescent at high redshifts",
    "it now appears that the universe was forming stars , and producing metals , at a high rate at @xmath9 .",
    "our results imply that rather than a quiescent universe we are observing an active but moderately obscured early universe .",
    "we have examined a diverse set of observations of starburst galaxies , spanning six decades of wavelength , sizes ranging from @xmath150.1 to 10 kpc , and redshifts out to @xmath231 .",
    "the observations were used to estimate effective radii @xmath16 , total luminosities @xmath17 , and effective surface brightnesses @xmath0 on the bolometric scale .",
    "the samples were drawn from observations obtained in 1 .  the rest frame space ultraviolet ( uv ) , 2 .  the far - infrared and  ( fir/ ) , and 3 .  21 cm radio emission .",
    "the uv data , which spans the largest range in @xmath6 , were consistently corrected for dust extinction as estimated from the uv reddening of the starbursts .",
    "we have demonstrated that this correction adequately models the redistribution of radiation from the uv to the fir in nearby starbursts .",
    "the extinction in the uv is significant .",
    "high-@xmath6 galaxies observed in the rest frame uv are too red to be naked starbursts .",
    "if this reddening is due to dust , the typical implied extinction is @xmath15 2 to 3 mag at @xmath232 .",
    "the corrected metal production rate at @xmath233 is then @xmath234 , about five times or more higher than madau _",
    "et  al . _",
    "s ( 1996 ) estimate of the hubble time averaged @xmath235 , but in good agreement with mushotzky &  loewenstein s ( 1997 ) estimate of @xmath236 during the epoch of elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "depending on the amount of extinction required for the data having @xmath237 , the peak in @xmath238 could be pushed back to @xmath239 . applying plausible extinction corrections",
    "illustrates that rather than being quiescent , much of the star formation in the early universe may be obscured .    the upper limit to the surface brightness of starbursts",
    "is parameterized by @xmath2 - the 90th percentile surface brightness of the samples .",
    "this statistic is susceptible to systematic uncertainties due to measurement biases and the heterogeneous sample selection .",
    "we find that the samples have the same @xmath2 to within a factor of three .",
    "this is about the level of agreement we expect for intrinsically similar samples affected by known flux biases .",
    "we conclude that to within a factor of a few the same @xmath2 applies to both dusty and relatively unobscured starbursts , it does not vary with size for @xmath240 kpc , and shows little evolution out to @xmath241 .",
    "our adopted 90th percentile surface brightness limit is the mean value ( in the log ) @xmath242 of the three samples .",
    "the absence of a strong wavelength variation of @xmath2 indicates that it corresponds to a physical limit on star formation intensity , rather than being an opacity effect .",
    "further evidence of the physical significance of @xmath2 comes from the central ism pressure @xmath243 measured in galaxies ( mostly starburst ) undergoing a strong galactic wind by heckman _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1990 ) .",
    "using the models of chevalier &  clegg ( 1985 ) and leitherer &  heckman ( 1995 ) , the corresponding surface brightness of the stellar population pressurizing the ism is @xmath244 .",
    "this is identical to @xmath2 , but is derived from completely different considerations .",
    "our adopted @xmath2 corresponds to a star formation intensity of @xmath245 .",
    "since starbursts represent the most intense star formation in the universe , and since selection effects depopulate low @xmath0 sources , these values of @xmath2 and @xmath159 parameterize the maximum _ global _ intensity of star formation observed in the universe . within starbursts",
    "there are localized sources with @xmath246 .",
    "these are star clusters",
    ". however , their integrated light does not dominate starburst emission , and their sizes are limited to @xmath247 pc .",
    "the intense cluster forming mode of star formation apparently does not operate for @xmath240 kpc .",
    "our results imply that some robust mechanism is limiting the global intensity of starbursts .",
    "the @xmath147 comparison implicates mechanical energy feedback from supernovae and stellar ejecta in regulating starbursts .",
    "we also examined the consequences of disk stability models ( e.g.  kennicutt , 1989 ) to the central portions of galaxies where the rotation curve is solid body like and most starbursts are observed to occur .",
    "there we expect an upper limit to @xmath248 , where @xmath165 is the gas velocity dispersion in the disk , @xmath171 is the angular frequency , and @xmath177 is the spherical volume density . we show that most starbursts with rotation curve data obey this limit for an adopted central velocity dispersion @xmath184 .",
    "this model implies that starbursts have higher @xmath0 than normal disk galaxies because the star formation occurs in the center of galaxies where the critical density is high and the star formation time - scale is short .",
    "unfortunately , this model ( while illuminating ) does not explain the constancy of @xmath2 , it only casts it in terms of a limit on @xmath171 or the central value of @xmath177 .",
    "normal galactic disks could not have been made in a maximum intensity burst because it would have been accomplished in much shorter than the dynamical time scale @xmath208 , the minimum time set by causality arguments .",
    "however , bulges , which often dominate the center of disk galaxies , can be made in a maximum intensity burst without violating such causality limits .",
    "the same goes for elliptical galaxies . considering the @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the high-@xmath6 galaxies , and the agreement of the corrected metal production rate derived from them with that expected at the epoch of e galaxy formation , it is tempting to speculate that at @xmath4 we are witnessing the formation of elliptical galaxies ( giavalisco _ et  al . _  1995 ) .",
