    "c0 and c1 , also show significant hard emission and prominent fe - k lines .",
    "the hard emission is very strong in region c0 , and relatively weaker in region c1 .",
    "because the source regions are very close in projection , some emission from each region ( from the wings of the psfs ) contaminates the extracted spectrum in the other .",
    "we assume that the hard spectrum originates entirely from region c0 and the soft emission entirely from region c1 , but that smearing by the psf wings mixes fluxes from the two sources .",
    "we fit the spectra simultaneously .",
    "each component is modeled as a combination of absorbed thermal components , with a scaled fraction of each spectrum contributing to the other spectrum . in the fit to region",
    "c0 , the soft components are scaled by @xmath32 , while in region c1 , the hard component ( and the gaussians ) are scaled by @xmath33 .",
    "the soft components were fitted by relatively unabsorbed soft thermal models ( @xmath34 0 , @xmath35 kev , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) . to better account for the intermediate energy flux , and for the hard component",
    ", we used a partial covering absorber ( @xmath38 ) model .",
    "the resulting model for the hard component required a hot ( @xmath39 ) very heavily absorbed ( @xmath40 ) thermal model with @xmath41% coverage fraction .",
    "the leakage with the partial covering model significantly improved the fit at intermediate energies , but a systematic @xmath42 excess remains for c0 ; this will be explored in a follow up paper .",
    "the large covering factor suggests that k@xmath13 emission from low ionization states should be present , and indeed features at 6.4kev and @xmath43 kev corresponding to fe k@xmath13 and si k@xmath13 are detected .",
    "although the model for the hard component produced significant fe - k emission , the very large residuals indicated that at least one additional line component is needed .",
    "this was implemented as a `` zero - width gaussian '' ( i.e. , a gaussian with negligible width compared to the instrumental resolution ) at 6.4 kev , consistent with neutral or low ionization fe . in the c0 spectrum ,",
    "a prominent line - like feature at @xmath43 kev is consistent with si - k emission from neutral or low - ionization si .",
    "the c3 x - ray spectrum appears to be mainly from a thermal plasma , with o , ne , and fe - l line emission ( 0.51 kev ) , and a prominent mg xi line feature at 1.34 kev .",
    "we fit the spectrum with absorbed ( tbabs ) thermal ( vapec ) plasma models . in order to match the spectrum at very soft ( @xmath44 ) , intermediate ( 1 - 2kev ) and harder ( @xmath45 ) energies ,",
    "we needed three thermal components with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ; the fitted absorption was effectively zero .",
    "fits with pure solar abundances did not fit well ( particularly the mg xi line feature at 1.34 kev ) , so the abundances of o , ne , mg , and fe (= ni ) were allowed to vary ( but with the same values for each of the thermal components ) .",
    "the fitted [ fe ] and [ ne ] abundances were effectively solar ( anders & grevesse 1989 abundances ) ; [ o ] was low ( @xmath49 ) , while [ mg ] was very high ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the resulting residuals suggested a line - like feature at about 1.66 kev ; it may be due to excess mg xii emission , beyond what is predicted by the three component thermal model .",
    "the hard emission component from the central region , c0 , observed in 2008 shows a striking resemblance in both temperature and high absorbing column to the hard emission observed in 2001 ( galloway & sokoloski 2004 ) .",
    "this indicates that the hard emission originates close to the accretor and may be associated with the boundary layer of the accretion disk or a bright spot ( kennea _ at al .",
    "the emission from this region is heavily absorbed by a partial covering absorber , with a small `` leakage '' accounting for some soft emission .",
    "the absorbing material could be related to the ejecta close to the accreting source or to the accretion disk , and may be associated with the material in the inner jet .",
    "the soft emission near the center at c1 is generally similar to the emission at c3 , but it is more difficult to characterize because of the blending with radiation from c0 .",
    "we suggest that it arises from the same mechanism , shock waves driven into the ambient gas by the jet .",
    "the new jet activity is likely a result of an ejection following the strong dimming of the light curve of ch cyg in the second half of 2006 ( eg .",
    "skopal et al .",
    "taranova and shenavrin ( 2007 ) found evidence for dust formation in ch cyg which resulted from a mass ejection in the close circumbinary region associated with the 2006 light dimming event .",
    "the light curve is very similar to the 1984 and 1996 dimming events after which jets were detected in radio and optical wavelengths . assuming that the `` new '' jet was ejected in the second half of 2006 , and a linear expansion",

    "( @xmath0250 au ) from the central source , which is significantly smaller than the @xmath03@xmath51@xmath51 ( 750 au ) sw portion of the jet .",
    "it is possible that this is the inner part of a continuous precessing jet , since a similar elongated structure , extending to @xmath0 0.7  at pa = 330@xmath12 , and fainter structure to the south at about same distance from the central source at pa = 150@xmath12 were detected in the _ chandra _ images from 2001 ( _ vis _ fig . 5 in karovska _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 ) .",
    "the inner jet and the inner counter - jet may be running into a shell of dust at @xmath01  from the central source , which was detected by biller _",
    "et al_. showed that the dust shell is significantly denser to the n , which could account for the difference in brightness of the c1 and c2 structures , if they are indeed a result of an interaction of the jet with the dust shell . after encountering the dust shell , the inner jet ( c2 )",
    "is then continuing to the sw , while the inner counter - jet ( c1 ) is slowed down significantly by the denser shell to the n.    the curved appearance of the outer portion of the sw jet and the observed clumps is consistent with an episodically powered precessing jet or a continuous jet with occasional mass ejections , or pulses ( @xmath52 crocker et al .",
    "2002 ; stute and sahai 2007 ) . the clumps , including the dominant c3 structure , may be shocked ejecta interacting with the circumbinary material ( eg . with mass loss from the red giant and/or with previously ejected material ) .",
    "we note that similar precessing jet - like outflows have been found in pre - planetary and planetary nebulae ( e.g. sahai and trauger ; 1998 ; soker , 2002 ; sahai _ et al_. 2005 ) , a fraction of which possibly evolve from symbiotic binaries like ch cyg .",
    "the fits to the c3 x - ray spectrum give temperatures corresponding to 400 to 1200 @xmath14 shocks .",
    "the spectral extraction region corresponds to a length scale of @xmath53 cm .",
    "if the line of sight depth of the region is comparable in size , the x - ray fit normalizations would imply densities of 1200 , 1000 , and 450 @xmath54 for the soft , medium , and hard components , respectively",
