    "low dimensional electron systems exhibit a rich variety of surprising effects which are due to the cooperative interplay of impurities and interactions . in one dimension even clean metallic systems",
    "are always strongly affected by interactions : at low energy scales physical properties obey anomalous power - laws , known as luttinger liquid behavior , which is very different from the conventional fermi liquid behavior describing most higher dimensional metals.@xcite in luttinger liquids with repulsive interactions already a single static impurity is known to affect the low - energy properties drastically.@xcite the impurity potential in a repulsive luttinger liquid becomes dressed by long - range oscillations which suppress the spectral weight for single - particle excitations near the impurity and also the conductance through the impurity down to zero in the low - energy limit .",
    "the _ asymptotic _ low - energy properties of luttinger liquids with a single impurity are rather well understood .",
    "universal power - laws and scaling functions have been obtained by bosonization , conformal field theory , and exact solutions for the low - energy asymptotics in special integrable cases.@xcite what remains to be developed , however , is a many - body method for _ microscopic _ models of interacting fermions with impurities , which does not only capture correctly the universal low - energy asymptotics , but allows one to compute observables on all energy scales , providing thus also _ non - universal _ properties , and in particular an answer to the important question at what _ scale _ the ultimate asymptotics sets in .",
    "that scale can indeed be surprisingly low , and the properties above it very different from the asymptotic behavior .",
    "some of the non - universal properties can be computed numerically by the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg),@xcite but this method is limited to lattice systems with about 1000 sites , and only a restricted set of observables can be evaluated with affordable computational effort .    in the last few years",
    "it has been realized that the functional renormalization group ( frg ) is a source of powerful new computation tools for interacting fermi systems , especially for low - dimensional systems with competing instabilities and entangled infrared singularities .",
    "the starting point of this approach is an exact hierarchy of differential flow equations for the green or vertex functions of the system , which is obtained by taking derivatives with respect to an infrared cutoff @xmath1.@xcite approximations are then constructed by truncating the hierarchy and parametrizing the vertex functions with a manageable set of variables or functions.@xcite    a relatively simple frg approximation for impurities in spinless luttinger liquids has been developed recently by some of us.@xcite the scheme starts from an frg hierarchy for one - particle irreducible vertex functions , as first derived in a field theoretical context by wetterich@xcite and morris,@xcite and for interacting fermi systems by salmhofer and honerkamp.@xcite a matsubara frequency cutoff is used as the flow parameter .",
    "the hierarchy is then truncated already at first order , such that the 2-particle vertex remains unrenormalized , and the flow of the self - energy , which describes the renormalized impurity potential , is determined by the bare 2-particle interaction .",
    "no simplified parametrization of the self - energy is necessary such that the full spatial dependence of the renormalized impurity potential can be obtained for very large lattice systems . in spite of the striking simplicity of this scheme it was shown that the effects of a single static impurity in a spinless luttinger liquid are fully captured qualitatively , and in the weak coupling limit also quantitatively.@xcite in particular",
    ", one obtains that impurity potentials in repulsive luttinger liquids become effectively stronger at lower energy scales , and act ultimately as a weak link between two otherwise separate wires , as predicted by kane and fisher.@xcite the frg also correctly yields the universal low energy power - laws with exponents that do not depend on the bare impurity strength .",
    "in addition , it was shown that the asymptotic behavior holds typically only at very low energy scales and for very large systems , except for very strong bare impurities.@xcite the frg approach to impurities in luttinger liquids was originally developed and tested for spectral densities of single - particle excitations , but has been applied very recently also to transport problems , such as persistent currents in mesoscopic rings@xcite and the conductance of interacting wires connected to non - interacting leads.@xcite the full power of the frg with its ability to deal naturally also with complex crossover phenomena emerges most convincingly in the multi - scale problem posed by the transport through a resonant double barrier.@xcite    in the present work we further develop the frg approach for impurities in luttinger liquids by including 2-particle vertex renormalization , that is we go one step further in the hierarchy of flow equations than previously.@xcite for spinless fermions this extension does not matter qualitatively , as the lowest order is already qualitatively correct , but the quantitative accuracy of the results improves considerably in particular at intermediate interaction strengths . for spin-@xmath2 systems , which we will treat in a subsequent work,@xcite vertex renormalization",
    "is necessary to take into account that backscattering of particles with opposite spins at opposite fermi points scales to zero in the low energy limit .",
    "a crucial point is to devise an efficient parametrization of the vertex by a managable number of variables .",
    "here we focus on spinless lattice fermions with nearest neighbor interaction as a prototype model .",
    "the bulk model is supplemented by site or hopping impurities .",
    "we also analyze the influence of boundaries , which can be viewed as infinite barriers or infinitesimal weak links .",
    "we choose to parametrize the vertex by a renormalized nearest neighbor interaction , which allows us to capture various advantageous features : the low energy flow of the vertex at @xmath3 in the pure system is obtained correctly to second order in the renormalized couplings ; the non - universal contributions at finite energy scales are correct to second order in the bare interaction ; the algorithm for the flow of the self - energy remains as fast as in the absence of vertex renormalization , such that one can easily deal with up to @xmath0 lattice sites .",
    "we compute spectral properties of single - particle excitations near an impurity and the oscillations in the density profile induced by an impurity , or by a boundary .",
    "the accuracy of the calculation is checked by comparing with dmrg results for systems with up to 1000 lattice sites and with exact results for the asymptotic behavior , which can be obtained from the bethe ansatz and bosonization .",

    "we use the one - particle irreducible version of the functional rg.@xcite the starting point is an exact hierarchy of flow equations for the irreducible vertex functions , which is obtained by cutting off the infrared part of the free propagator on a scale @xmath1 , and differentiating the generating functional for the vertex functions with respect to this scale.@xcite      the cutoff can be imposed in many different ways .",
    "the only requirement is that the infrared singularities must be regularized such that the flow equations allow for a regular perturbation expansion in powers of the renormalized two - particle vertex . for our purposes",
    "a sharp matsubara frequency cutoff is the most efficient choice .",
    "a momentum cutoff is less suitable here since the impurity spoils momentum conservation .",

    "however , there is another algorithm which is much more accurate for near - singular matrices at the end of the rg flow : the double factorization.@xcite it does not rely on the symmetry of @xmath263 but uses the complementary `` udl '' factorization @xmath296 where the matrix elements are obtained as @xmath297 we proceed as for the ldu factorization above and get @xmath298 we can combine equations ( [ eq : appc : fromdiag ] ) and ( [ eq : appc : todiag ] ) to relate consecutive diagonal elements : @xmath299 thus we start with ( [ eq : appc : backsubst0 ] ) and use the @xmath300 decomposition to go one matrix element to the right in the inverse matrix , from the diagonal to the first off - diagonal ( [ eq : appc : todiag ] ) , while the @xmath301 decomposition allows to go down by one , back to the next diagonal element ( [ eq : appc : fromdiag ] ) .",
    "there is no need to compute the full inverse matrix .",
    "one can implement the algorithm without knowing the derivation by using equations ( [ eq : appc : ldu ] ) and ( [ eq : appc : udl ] ) - ( [ eq : appc : backsubst2 ] ) .",
    "one can further eliminate the @xmath8 s using equations ( [ eq : appc : ldu ] ) and ( [ eq : appc : udl ] ) and implement the algorithm such that only the input vectors @xmath302 , @xmath303 and the output vectors @xmath304 , @xmath305 enter the temporary storage .",
    "this double factorization is numerically accurate to more than 10 significant digits ( using double precision ) even for large lattices ( @xmath0 sites ) and almost singular matrices with @xmath306 which appear at the end of the flow for half filling .",
    "the right hand side of the flow equations ( 41 ) for the density response vertex @xmath307 can be computed in @xmath159 time using the fact that the upper triangular part of the inverse of a tridiagonal matrix ( here @xmath308 ) is the upper triangular part of the outer product of two vectors.@xcite                              first computational applications of the frg to fermi systems were performed for the 2d hubbard model , see d. zanchi and h.j .",
