    "we denote by @xmath12 and @xmath13 the sets @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we will also use the following notation : @xmath16    for any @xmath17 and any @xmath18 , it is well known that there exists exactly one solution @xmath19 to , with the following regularity : @xmath20 ; l^2(0 , 1 ) ) \\cap c^1([0 , t ] ; h^{-1}(0 , 1))\\ ] ] ( see for instance  @xcite ) .    on the other hand , for any @xmath21 , the null controllability problem for ( [ eq : wave ] ) at time @xmath22 is the following : for each @xmath23 , find @xmath18 such that the corresponding solution to ( [ eq : wave ] ) satisfies @xmath24    in view of the linearity and reversibility of the wave equation , is null - controllable at @xmath22 if and only if it is _ exactly controllable _ in  @xmath25 at time @xmath22 , i.e.  if and only if for any  @xmath23 and any  @xmath26 there exist controls @xmath18 such that the associated @xmath19 satisfies @xmath27    it is well known that is null - controllable at any _ large _ time @xmath28 for some @xmath29 that depends on @xmath30 ( for instance , see  @xcite for @xmath31 and @xmath32 leading to @xmath33 and see  @xcite for a general situation ) . as a consequence of the _ hilbert uniqueness method _ of j .-",
    "lions  @xcite , it is also known that the null controllability of   is equivalent to an observability inequality for the associated adjoint problem .",
    "the goal of this paper is to design and analyze a numerical method allowing to solve the previous null controllability problem .",
    "so far , the approximation of the minimal @xmath34-norm control  the so - called hum control  has focused most of the attention .",
    "the earlier contribution is due to glowinski and lions in  @xcite ( see also @xcite for an update ) and relies on duality arguments .",
    "duality allows to replace the original constrained minimization problem by an unconstrained and _ a priori _ easier minimization ( dual ) problem .",
    "however , as observed in  @xcite and later in  @xcite , depending on the approximation method that is used , this approach can lead to some numerical difficulties .",
    "let us be more precise .",
    "it is easily seen that the hum control is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 solves the backwards wave system @xmath37 and @xmath38 minimizes the strictly convex and coercive functional @xmath39 over @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 denotes the duality product for  @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the coercivity of @xmath44 over @xmath45 is a consequence of the _ observability inequality _ @xmath46 that holds for some constant @xmath47 .",
    "this inequality has been derived in @xcite using the _ multipliers method . _    at the numerical level , for standard approximation schemes ( based on finite difference or finite element methods ) , the discrete version of ( [ io ] ) may not hold uniformly with respect to the discretization parameter , say @xmath48 .",
    "in other words , the constant @xmath49 may blow up as @xmath48 goes to  zero .",
    "consequently , in such cases the functional @xmath50 ( the discrete version of @xmath44 ) fails to be coercive uniformly with respect to @xmath48 and the sequence @xmath51 may not converge to @xmath52 as @xmath53 , but diverge exponentially .",
    "these pathologies , by now well - known and understood , are due to the spurious discrete high frequencies generated by the finite dimensional approximation ; we refer to  @xcite for a review on that topic ; see  @xcite for detailed examples of the behavior observed with finite difference methods .",
    "several remedies based on more elaborated approximations have been proposed and analyzed in the last decade .",
    "let us mention the use of mixed finite elements  @xcite , additional viscosity terms which have the effect to restore the uniform property  @xcite and also filtering technics  @xcite .",
    "also , notice that some error estimates have been obtained recently , see  @xcite .    in this paper , following the recent work @xcite devoted to the heat equation",
    ", we consider a different approach .",
    "specifically , we consider the following extremal problem : @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the linear manifold @xmath56    here , we assume that the weights @xmath57 and @xmath58 are strictly positive , continuous and uniformly bounded from below by a positive constant in  @xmath59 and  @xmath60 , respectively .    as in the previous @xmath34-norm situation ( where we simply have @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) , we can apply duality arguments in order to find a solution to ( [ p - fi ] ) , by introducing the unconstrained dual problem @xmath63 where @xmath36 solves the nonhomogeneous backwards problem @xmath64    here , @xmath65 is the conjugate function of @xmath66 in the sense of fenchel and rockafellar  @xcite and , if  @xmath67 and  @xmath68 ( that is , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are positively bounded from below ) , @xmath65 is coercive in @xmath71 thanks to  ( [ io ] ) .",
    "therefore , if @xmath72 denotes the minimizer of @xmath65 , the corresponding optimal pair for @xmath66 is given by @xmath73    at the discrete level , at least for standard approximation schemes , we may suspect that the coercivity of @xmath65 may not hold uniformly with respect to the discretization parameters , leading to the pathologies and the lack of convergence we have just mentioned .",
    "on the other hand , the fact that the state variable @xmath19 appears explicitly in the cost @xmath66 makes it possible to avoid dual methods .",
    "we can use instead suitable primal methods to get an optimal pair @xmath74 .",
    "the formulation , analysis and practical implementation of these primal methods is the main goal of this paper .    more precisely , the optimality conditions for the functional @xmath66 allow to express explicitly the optimal pair @xmath75 in terms of a new variable , the solution of a fourth - order _ elliptic _ problem in the space - time domain @xmath59 that is well - posed under some conditions on @xmath22 , the coefficient @xmath30 and the weights @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "sufficient conditions are deduced from an appropriate global carleman estimate , an updated version of the inequalities established in  @xcite . from a numerical viewpoint ,",
    "this elliptic formulation is appropriate for a standard finite element analysis . by introducing adequate finite dimensional spaces ,",
    "we are thus able to deduce satisfactory convergence results for the control , something that does not seem easy to get in the framework of a dual approach .",
    "a similar primal approach , based on ideas by fursikov and imanuvilov  @xcite , has been used in  @xcite for the numerical null controllability of the heat equation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .    in section  [ sec : var ] , adapting the arguments and results in  @xcite , we show that the solution to   can be expressed in terms of the unique solution @xmath76 to the variational problem ( [ eq : varp ] ) in the hilbert space @xmath77 , defined as the completion of @xmath78 with respect to the inner product ( [ ip ] ) ; see  proposition  [ prop : yp ] .",
    "the well - posedness is deduced from the application of riesz s theorem : a suitable global carleman inequality ensures the continuity of the linear form in  ( [ eq : varp ] ) for @xmath22 large enough when @xmath57 and @xmath58 are given by  ( [ eq : rho ] ) ; see  theorem  [ th : carleman ] .    in section  [ sec : numerical_analysis ] , we analyze the variational problem ( [ eq : varp ] ) from the viewpoint of the finite element theory .",
    "thus , we replace @xmath77 by a conformal finite element space @xmath79 of @xmath80 functions defined by  ( [ 19a ] ) and we show that the unique solution @xmath81 to the finite dimensional problem ( [ pb_phh ] ) converges ( strongly ) for the @xmath77-norm to @xmath76 as @xmath48 goes to zero .",
    "section  [ sec : numerics ] contains some numerical experiments that illustrate and confirm the convergence of the sequence @xmath82 .",
    "finally , we present some additional comments in  section  [ sec : end_remarks ] and we provide some details of the proof of  theorem  [ th : carleman ] in the appendix .",
    "with the notation introduced in section  [ sec : intro ] , the following result holds :    [ prop : solmin ] let @xmath21 be large enough .",
    "let us assume that @xmath57 and  @xmath58 are positive and satisfy @xmath83 , @xmath84 and  @xmath85 .",
    "then , for any @xmath86 , there exists exactly one solution to the extremal problem .",
    "the proof is simple . indeed , for @xmath87 ,",
    "null controllability holds and @xmath55 is non - empty .",
    "furthermore , it is a closed convex set of @xmath88 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath89 is strictly convex , proper and lower - semicontinuous in  @xmath88 and @xmath90 hence , the extremal problem ( [ p - fi ] ) certainly possesses a unique solution .    in this paper , it will be convenient to assume that the coefficient @xmath30 belongs to the family @xmath91 ) } : a(x)\\geq a_0 \\!>\\ ! 0 , \\\\ { \\displaystyle}\\phantom{\\mathcal{a}(x_0,a_0 ) } -\\min_{[0,1 ] } \\,\\bigl ( a(x ) + ( x - x_0)a_x(x ) \\bigr ) < \\min_{[0,1 ] } \\,\\bigl ( a(x ) + { 1\\over2}(x - x_0)a_x(x ) \\bigr ) \\,\\ } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 and  @xmath93 is a positive constant .",
    "it is easy to check that the constant function @xmath94 belongs to @xmath95 .",
    "similarly , any non - decreasing smooth function bounded from below by  @xmath93 belongs to @xmath95 . roughly speaking ,",
    "@xmath96 means that @xmath30 is sufficiently smooth , strictly positive and not too decreasing in  @xmath4 $ ] .    under the assumption , there exists  good \" weight functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 which provide a very suitable solution to the original null controllability problem .",
    "they can be deduced from global carleman inequalities .",
    "the argument is the following .",

    "there exists an important literature related to ( global ) carleman estimates for the wave equation .",
    "almost all references deal with the particular case @xmath118 ; we refer to  @xcite .",
    "the case where @xmath30 is non - constant is less studied ; we refer to  @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ th : carleman ] follows closely the ideas used in the proofs of  theorems  2.1 and  2.5 in  @xcite to obtain a global carleman estimate for the wave equation when @xmath31 .",
    "the parts of the proof which become different for non - constant @xmath30 are detailed in the appendix of this paper .",
    "let us consider the linear space @xmath119 the bilinear form @xmath120 is a scalar product in  @xmath78 .",
    "indeed , in view of  , the unique continuation property for the wave equation holds . accordingly , if @xmath121 , @xmath122 in  @xmath59 and  @xmath123 on  @xmath124 , then @xmath125 .",
    "this shows that @xmath126 is certainly a scalar product in  @xmath78 .",
    "let @xmath77 be the completion of @xmath78 with respect to this scalar product .",
    "then @xmath77 is a hilbert space for @xmath126 and we can deduce from theorem  [ th : carleman ] the following result , that indicates which are the appropriate weights @xmath57 and @xmath58 for our controllability problem :    [ lem : cont ] let us assume that @xmath113 , let us set @xmath127 and let us consider the corresponding hilbert space @xmath77 .",

    "a similar trick has been used in  @xcite in the context of the heat equation , where we find weights that blow up exponentially as @xmath179 .",
    "@xmath144    [ re : about_s ] the exponential form of the weights @xmath57 and @xmath58 is purely technical and is related to carleman estimates .",
    "actually , since for any @xmath130 and @xmath129 these weights are uniformly bounded and uniformly positive in  @xmath180 , the space @xmath77 is independent of @xmath57 and @xmath58 and one could apply the primal approach to the cost @xmath66 ( defined in ( [ p - fi ] ) ) for any bounded and positive weights .",

    "let us begin this section with some general considerations on the use of carleman weights that serve to justify our approach :    1 .",
    "the search of a control minimizing @xmath66 in  , where @xmath19 is involved , is very appropriate from the numerical viewpoint . as shown in section [ sec : var ] , the explicit occurrence of the state variable @xmath19 leads to an elliptic problem in  @xmath59 , that is easy to analyze and solve ( at this level , the particular choice of the weight is less important ) .",
    "this approach does not require the discretization of the wave operator , as for usual dual approachs ; therefore , it does not generate any spurious oscillations and leads to numerical well - posedness .",
    "this is an important feature of the approach .",
    "2 .   the carleman weights provide regularity of the solution to   and therefore allows to derive estimates of the errors @xmath370 in term of @xmath371 .",
    "this will be detailed in a forthcoming work .",
    "the process can be viewed as a first step for the numerical controllability of semi - linear problems : if we just apply a fixed - point argument , we will find at each iterate a linear equation with non - regular coefficients depending on @xmath227 and  @xmath141 for which the present approach is adequate .",
    "4 .   in our numerical experiments",
    "we have not found any essential difference for small or large @xmath130 or @xmath129 : this is in full agreement with remark [ re : about_s ] and section [ carlemanconstant ] .",
    "furthermore , we mention that the approach has been considered by analogy with the similar analysis in references  @xcite to  @xcite , dealing with heat equations .",
    "the solution to the variational formulation ( [ eq : varp ] ) is also the unique minimizer of the functional  @xmath372 , with @xmath373 this is similar to the conjugate functional @xmath65 in  ( [ p - fistar ] ) .",
    "actually , we notice that @xmath374 for all @xmath375 .",
    "therefore , the extremal problems ( [ p - fistar ] ) and ( [ newi ] ) are connected to each other having ( [ p - fi ] ) as starting point .",
    "the problem ( [ eq : varp ] ) , deduced from the primal approach belongs to the framework of elliptic variational problems in two dimensions and is well tailored for a resolution with finite elements .",
    "the dual problem ( [ p - fistar ] ) is of hyperbolic nature : the time variable is kept explicitly and time integration is required .",
    "note that we may also derive the optimality conditions for @xmath65 ( as we did in section [ sec : var ] for @xmath66 ) : this leads , at least formally , to the problem ( [ eq : varp ] ) .",
    "we also mention @xcite where a ( different ) variational approach is introduced .",
    "the variational approach used here leads to satisfactory convergence results , in particular the strong convergence of the approximate controls @xmath332 towards a null control of the wave equation .",
    "this relies in a fundamental way on the fact that we work in a subspace @xmath79 of  @xmath77 .",
    "indeed , this allows to write directly the carleman estimate in @xmath79 and get that the function @xmath372 ( given by ( [ newi ] ) ) is uniformly coercive with respect to the discretization parameter @xmath48 .    on the other hand , notice that no wave equation has to be solved in order to compute the approximations @xmath332 . for each @xmath48 , once @xmath332 is known , we must solve the wave equation , in a post - treatment process , to compute the corresponding state @xmath333 ( recall that , actually , this may be avoided by using directly the optimality condition @xmath376 ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the dual approach .",
    "indeed , the minimization of @xmath65 by an iterative process requires the resolution of wave equations , through a decoupled space and time discretization .",
    "as recalled in the introduction , this may lea to numerical pathologies ( the occurrence of spurious high frequency solutions ) and , therefore , needs some specific numerical approximations and techniques .",
    "we mention the work  @xcite , where the authors prove , in a close context and within a dual approach , a weaker uniform semi - discrete carleman estimate with an additional term in the right hand side , necessary to absorb these possibly spurious high frequencies ( see  @xcite , theorem  2.3 ) .",
    "notice that the computed @xmath332 are not _ a priori _ null controls for discrete systems ( associated to the wave equation ( [ eq : wave ] ) ) , but simply approximations of the control @xmath52 furnished by the solution to  .",
    "if one wants to go further in the comparison , it can be said that the primal approach aims to first compute the control for ( [ eq : wave ] ) and then approximate it , while the dual classical method aims first to discretize ( [ eq : wave ] ) and then control the corresponding finite dimensional system .",
    "let us also observe that the ( primal ) approach in this paper is relatively easy to implement .",
    "in practice , the resolution is reduced to solve a linear system , with a banded sparse , symmetric and definite positive matrix , for which efficient direct @xmath377 type solvers are known and available .",
    "furthermore , we may want to adapt ( and refine locally ) the mesh of @xmath59 in order to improve convergence and such adaptation is much simpler than in the dual approach , where @xmath141 is `` conserved '' as a time variable .",
    "for additional considerations , see also  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the approach can be extended to the higher dimensional case of the wave equation in a bounded set @xmath379 , with  @xmath380 .",
    "however , the use of @xmath334-finite element is a bit more involved . arguing as in  @xcite",
    ", we may avoid this difficulty by introducing a mixed formulation equivalent to ( [ eq : varp ] ) .",
    "the idea is to keep explicit the variable @xmath19 in the formulation and to introduce a lagrange multiplier , associated to the constraint @xmath381 ( see  ( [ eq : yvp ] ) ) .",
    "we obtain the following mixed formulation : find @xmath382 such that @xmath383 where @xmath384 taking advantage of the global estimate ( [ eq : carlt ] ) , we may show , through an appropriate inf - sup condition , that ( [ mixed ] ) is well - posed in @xmath385 .",
    "moreover , the approximation of this formulation may be addressed using @xmath378-finite element , which is very convenient .",
    "the approximation is non - conformal .",
    "more precisely , the variable @xmath76 is now sought in a space @xmath386 of @xmath378-functions that is not included in @xmath77 .    at the discrete level , ( [ mixed ] )",
    "reduces the controllability problem to the inversion of a square , banded and symmetric matrix .",
    "moreover , as before , no wave equation has to be solved , whence the numerical pathology described above is not expected .",
    "however , since the underlying approximation is not conformal ( this is the price to pay to avoid @xmath334 finite elements ) , a careful ( and _ a priori _ not straightforward ) choice for @xmath386 has to be done in order to guarantee a uniform discrete inf - sup condition .",
    "the analysis of this point , as well as the use of stabilized finite elements , will be detailed in a future work .",
    "the approach presented here can be extended and adapted to other equations and systems .",
    "what is needed is , essentially , an appropriate carleman estimate .",
    "in particular , we can adapt the previous ideas and results to the inner controllability case , i.e.  the null controlability of the wave equation with distributed controls acting on a ( small ) sub - domain @xmath387 of @xmath153 .",
    "furthermore , using finite element tools , we can also get results in the case where the sub - domain @xmath387 varies in time , that is non - cylindrical control domains @xmath388 of the form @xmath389 where @xmath390 and @xmath391 are smooths functions on @xmath392 $ ] , with @xmath393 .",
    "this opens the possibility to optimize numerically the domain @xmath388 , as was done in a cylindrical situations in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let us finally mention that many non - linear situations can be considered through a suitable linearization and iterative process .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for some ideas in a similar parabolic situation .",
    "we first prove a global carleman estimate for functions @xmath394 satisfying vanishing initial and final conditions . in",
    "what follows , @xmath395 stands for the operator given in   with @xmath396 .",
    "it is easy to check that , if the estimate holds in this particular case , then the same estimate holds for any potential @xmath397 .",

    "since the argument provides conditions on the set of admissible @xmath30 and , to our knowledge , these conditions have not been stated in this form before , we provide here the detailed proof .                      secondly , notice that , under the assumption @xmath398 , if @xmath97 satisfies  , we can choose @xmath409 in such a way that the terms of order @xmath428 are positive .",
