    "microwave conductivity measurements have provided a powerful method for investigating the low energy charge dynamics of high temperature cuprate superconductors .",
    "early on , the observation of a linear temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth @xmath6 in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath7 provided some of the first evidence of @xmath3-wave pairing in these materials.@xcite over a decade later , the @xmath3-wave superconducting phase remains one of the cornerstones of our understanding of the cuprate problem .",
    "surprisingly , the physics of the superconducting state seems to be well described as a bcs instability of a two - dimensional fermi liquid . however , it is essential that this conjecture be thoroughly tested , and one of the best ways to do this is through detailed measurements of charge transport in high quality single crystals . in this work",
    "we report on microwave spectroscopy of two gold - standard cuprate materials  ortho - i yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8  and ortho - ii yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath9   and develop a simple phenomenology that describes their low - energy charge dynamics .    understanding the role of impurities in the cuprate superconductors",
    "has taken many years of great effort .",
    "the materials have complicated chemistry  containing at least four elements  and have much greater sensitivity to disorder than conventional superconductors due to finite - angular - momentum cooper pairing .",
    "early measurements on the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2  showed deviations from the linear temperature dependence expected for a clean @xmath3-wave superconductor .",
    "it was later suggested that these effects could be the result of pair - breaking disorder,@xcite a conjecture that was confirmed by showing that the controlled addition of zn impurities to high quality yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2  crystals caused a crossover in @xmath10 from @xmath11 to @xmath12 behaviour.@xcite ongoing efforts to uncover the intrinsic physics of the cuprates depend on continued improvements in sample quality .",
    "the samples used in this work are the most well - ordered cuprates available , and are of such exceedingly high purity and crystallinity that even the off - plane dopant oxygen atoms are highly - ordered.@xcite    some of the earliest measurements of the low energy electromagnetic response of the cuprates were made by nuss _",
    "et al . _ , who measured the conductivity of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath13   thin films using terahertz spectroscopy over the frequency range 0.5  thz to 2.5  thz.@xcite the observation of a peak in @xmath14 below the critical temperature @xmath15 was attributed to a strong decrease in inelastic scattering , rather than the conductivity coherence peak that occurs in @xmath16-wave bcs superconductors . shortly afterward ,",
    "measured a similar peak in @xmath14 in the microwave range.@xcite they proposed that this was the result of a competition between the rapid increase in quasiparticle lifetime @xmath17 and the decaying quasiparticle density @xmath18 as the temperature was reduced .",
    "this analysis was carried out within the context of a drude model characterized by an energy - independent transport relaxation rate @xmath19 .",
    "other transport measurements including thermal conductivity @xcite and higher frequency electromagnetic measurements @xcite have also confirmed the rapid collapse in scattering on entering the superconducting state .    in a more recent publication ,",
    "our group presented a series of microwave measurements that confirmed and extended these earlier findings.@xcite this was made possible by two experimental developments : the advent of higher purity yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2  crystals grown in bazro@xmath1 crucibles and the development of a sufficient number of fixed - frequency cavity perturbation systems to map out a coarse microwave conductivity spectrum .",
    "five superconducting resonators , operating between 1  ghz and 75  ghz , were used to examine the surface impedance of _ the same single crystal sample _ of fully - doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8 over the temperature range 2  k to 100  k ( the conductivity inferred from these data is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : figure6 ] of the present article ) . at each temperature",
    "the conductivity spectrum was fit to a simple drude model , which captured the features of the data well , thus supporting the assumptions used in the earlier work .",
    "the temperature dependent quasiparticle scattering rate @xmath19 derived from these fits was seen to decrease rapidly below @xmath15 and saturate at a constant value of 6@xmath20  s@xmath21 below 20  k , corresponding to a spectral width of approximately 9  ghz . assuming a fermi velocity @xmath22cm / s,@xcite the residual scattering rate implies a quasiparticle mean free path of 4  @xmath23 m , a very large distance for a complicated quaternary oxide .    however , the observation of a temperature independent transport relaxation rate is at odds with standard models for the electrical conductivity of a @xmath3-wave superconductor@xcite and resolving this elastic scattering problem is a major goal of the work presented in this article .",
    "the strong temperature dependence of the transport relaxation rate at higher temperatures , where the scattering processes are inelastic , has motivated models in which the opening of a gap in the spectrum of electronic excitations in the system leads to a collapse of the inelastic transport relaxation rate.@xcite finally , the same set of fixed frequency resonators was used to probe the conductivity for currents along the crystal @xmath5-axis of ortho - i yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8 . in these measurements , currents are parallel to the cuo chains and reveal an anisotropy in charge conduction that can be attributed to the sum of a narrow cuo@xmath0  plane quasiparticle spectrum and a very broad spectral feature arising from the one - dimensional cuo chains.@xcite    greater insight into the low temperature charge dynamics of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2  was gained following the development of a novel low temperature microwave spectrometer that could measure the conductivity spectrum as a _ continuous _ function of frequency.@xcite spectroscopy of ortho - ii yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath9  revealed that the nodal quasiparticle spectrum _ did _ in fact contain most of the features expected for weak - limit impurity scattering in a clean @xmath3-wave superconductor , namely a sharp cusp - like spectrum and a linear - in - temperature spectral width .",
    "in contrast , similar spectroscopy of ortho - i yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8  material displayed much more drude - like spectra , except at the very lowest temperatures .",
    "we return to examining these features in the present article , presenting a complete body of microwave data on and ortho - ii yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , and show how these data can be described by a simple phenomenlogy that captures the physics of energy - dependent charge dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : experiment ] begins with a brief discussion of the two main experimental techniques , fixed - frequency microwave cavity perturbation and broadband bolometric surface resistance spectroscopy . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phenomenology ] we use the broadband bolometric surface resistance data to extract detailed conductivity spectra and present a simple phenomenological model of the conductivity . with this in hand , in sec .  [",
    "sec : conductivity ] we process data from the five fixed - frequency experiments , which provide a means of capturing the conductivity spectrum at higher temperatures than can be reached with the bolometric experiment . finally , we examine the two key parameters that emerge from fitting to the experimental data : the width of the conductivity spectrum , which measures the thermally - averaged transport relaxation rate ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : spectralwidth ] ) and the total integrated spectral weight or ` quasiparticle oscillator strength ' ( sec .  [",
    "subsec : spectralweight ] ) . throughout this article",
    "we use recently revised absolute values of the @xmath24 penetration depths obtained using a newly developed zero - field esr absorption method.@xcite the revised penetration depths are considerably shorter than existing values in the literature and result in substantial quantitative changes to the previously published quasiparticle conductivity and superfluid density . however ,",
    "we emphasize that neither the qualitative form of the conductivity data nor the main conclusions drawn from it are affected .",
    "in this paper we focus on the microwave conductivity , @xmath25 , in the long wavelength limit and in the linear response regime . in experiments that probe the conductivity , the quantity that is inferred from measurements is the microwave surface impedance @xmath26 .",
    "when the applied microwave fields are screened on a length scale that is large compared to the characteristic size of the wavefunctions of both the cooper pairs and the single - particle excitations ( the coherence length @xmath27 and mean free path @xmath28 , respectively ) it is possible to describe the charge response by local electrodynamics , in which case : @xmath29 in very clean cuprate samples the mean free path will exceed the penetration depth and the electrodynamics will not necessarily remain in the local limit .",
    "however , it is possible to take advantage of the two dimensional electronic structure of the cuprates , which gives rise to a short coherence length and mean free path along the crystal @xmath30 direction , to ensure that the charge response _ is _",
    "local.@xcite in the work reported here we have exclusively used such geometries .    as pairs condense in a superconductor , the reactive response of the superfluid quickly overwhelms the dissipative response of the quasiparticle excitations , and over most of the temperature range @xmath31 .",
    "the local electrodynamic relation then simplifies to the following approximate forms : @xmath32 from these expressions it is clear that a measurement of the surface resistance @xmath33 contains information about the real part of the conductivity @xmath34 , while a measurement of the surface reactance @xmath35 is a direct probe of the penetration depth @xmath36 . as with nearly all forms of spectroscopy ,",
    "technical limitations require one to work with incomplete spectroscopic information and subsequently to rely on causality to extract the quantities of interest .",
    "our present work is no exception .",
    "however , in this article we present a wide range of measurements that not only allow us to extract the frequency - dependent conductivity , but also provide a set of checks and balances through the oscillator - strength sum rule that let us verify our results in detail .    in these measurements ,",
    "a well - defined electromagnetic geometry must be used for three reasons : to separate the individual components of the conductivity tensor , to ensure that demagnetization effects are well controlled , and to enforce local electrodynamics . a particularly clean approach that has been widely used",
    "is to place the sample in a microwave enclosure near a position of high symmetry , where there is an electric node and the microwave magnetic field is quasi - homogeneous .",
    "single crystal samples of many of the cuprate superconductors grow naturally as platelets having a broad @xmath37@xmath38 plane crystal face and thin @xmath39-axis dimension . in this case ,",
    "demagnetization effects are minimized if the broad face of the sample is aligned parallel to the microwave magnetic field . in response to the microwave fields , screening currents flow near the surface of the sample , across the broad @xmath37@xmath38 face , closing along the @xmath39 direction to complete a loop .",
    "all measurements presented in this article employ thin crystals with negligible @xmath30-axis contribution , and were carried out in this low - demagnetizing factor orientation .",
    "an experimental feature common to each of the seven sets of apparatus employed in this work is the use of a sapphire hot finger.@xcite this arrangement allows a sample to be held at an elevated temperature in the microwave fields , while the resonator remains at base temperature . for the field configuration we utilize ,",
    "the sapphire plate is transparent to microwaves and makes a negligible contribution to the dissipation .",
    "the sample is affixed to the sapphire plate ( with a very small amount of silicone grease ) that is then inserted into the microwave field through a hole in the metal end - wall that is small enough to cut off microwave propagation at the operating frequency .",
    "the thermometer and heater are located outside the cut - off hole , in intimate thermal contact with the sapphire isothermal stage , which is in turn weakly linked to the 1.2  k pumped helium bath .    resolving the microwave surface impedance of small single - crystal cuprate samples over a wide temperature range",
    "has been achieved by the use of cavity - perturbation techniques.@xcite in these experiments the sample under test is brought into the microwave fields of a high quality - factor ( high-@xmath40 ) resonant structure such as a superconducting cavity or a loop  gap resonator . in cavity perturbation ,",
    "shifts in the resonant frequency @xmath41 and quality factor @xmath40 are related to the surface impedance via:@xcite @xmath42    the quantity @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the quality factor of the resonator when it contains the sample at temperature @xmath11 , and @xmath45 is the quality factor of the empty resonator .",
    "@xmath46 is the shift in frequency of the loaded resonator on warming the sample from base temperature to temperature @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath33 is the absolute surface resistance , and the geometric factor @xmath48 depends on the dimensions of both the cavity and the sample , as well as the geometry of the fields that are being perturbed , and is determined empirically .    the direct relationship in eq .",
    "[ eqn : cavitypert ] assumes that the sample is much thicker than the length scale of the electromagnetic screening  either the superconducting penetration depth @xmath36 or the normal - state skin depth . in situations when the screening currents penetrate to a depth approaching the sample thickness , eq .  [ eqn : cavitypert ] must be modified . for our yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2  samples , which have a thickness @xmath49 ,",
    "this becomes important only in a very narrow temperature region just below @xmath15 , and in the normal state where the skin depth is large . to account for this effect",
    ", we use a model that solves the electromagnetic field equations in our one - dimensional geometry with the microwave field applied parallel to the broad face of the sample.@xcite the result is a more complete version of eq .",
    "[ eqn : cavitypert ] that explicitly involves the sample thickness @xmath50 : @xmath51\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the sample volume , @xmath53 is the effective cavity volume , @xmath54 is a constant set by the type of cavity and its field configuration , and @xmath55 is the complex propagation constant for the electromagnetic field in the sample . for this expression , @xmath56 is modified and is now the shift in frequency on inserting the sample into the empty resonator , @xmath57 .",
    "the physical quantities of interest , including @xmath33 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath34 and @xmath58 are determined from measurements of @xmath56 and @xmath59 and the relationships @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "while it is possible to calibrate @xmath33 measurements to very good accuracy , cavity - perturbation techniques do not easily yield an absolute value for @xmath62 since a measurement of the absolute penetration depth amounts to a comparison of the total volume of the sample to the volume of the sample minus the small field - penetrated region at the surface of the sample .",
    "it is impossible to measure the dimensions of a single crystal sample precisely enough to achieve an absolute measure of the in - plane @xmath36 this way .",
    "recent gd esr measurements have provided a breakthrough in absolute penetration depth measurements by using the characteristic microwave absorption of gd ions lightly doped through the crystal as a magnetic tracer to measure the field - penetrated volume at the surface of the sample _",
    "directly_.@xcite    the calibration procedure for the superconducting resonators relies on measurements of well - characterized pbsn samples of similar dimensions as the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2  crystal , as well as runs without any sample at all .",
    "these measurements allow for the small corrections necessary to account for background losses and the finite volume of the crystal .",
    "each resonator experiment must be calibrated independently .",
    "as a result , there is up to a 10% systematic uncertainty in the overall scale factor at each frequency .",
    "stochastic noise is typically much less than 5% for measurements well below @xmath15 .    in cavity perturbation experiments ,",
    "the resonator is generally restricted to operate at a single fixed frequency , requiring the use of many separate sets of experimental apparatus to capture a frequency spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the cavity perturbation method requires that the dissipation of the unknown sample be comparable to the dissipation of the cavity itself in order for the absorption to be measured with high precision .",
    "this is a strong requirement on the cavity when the sample is a high quality superconductor in the @xmath63 limit .",
    "the measurement of the residual absorption in superconductors is challenging at any frequency : in the case of infra - red spectroscopy the problem becomes that of measuring values of reflectance that are very close to unity . in microwave cavity perturbation measurements",
    "there is a similar problem of discerning the small difference in cavity q with the sample in and out .",
    "both techniques have problems with calibration and discerning small differences between two large numbers .",
    "these sensitivity problems are circumvented in a direct absorption measurement . we have recently developed an apparatus capable of obtaining continuous - frequency measurements of the absolute microwave surface resistance in low - loss single crystal samples , which has been described in detail elsewhere.@xcite the instrument employs a bolometric method of detection in which the sample of interest is exposed to a microwave frequency magnetic field @xmath64 whose frequency can be varied , and the corresponding temperature rise is measured .",
    "this method relies on the fact that the power absorption in a microwave magnetic field is directly proportional to the surface resistance @xmath33 : @xmath65 where @xmath64 is the root - mean - square magnitude of the magnetic field at the surface @xmath66 .",
    "measurements of the temperature rise of the sample as a function of frequency directly give @xmath67 .",
    "to enhance rejection of spurious temperature variations , the rf power is amplitude modulated at low frequency and the resulting temperature oscillations of the sample are detected synchronously . to provide a frequency - tunable microwave magnetic field ,",
    "the sample is placed in a custom - made rectangular coaxial transmission line that supports a tem mode in which the @xmath68 fields lie in the transverse plane and form closed loops around the centre conductor . the line is terminated by shorting the center conductor and outer conductor with a flat , metallic endwall , thus enforcing an electric field node at the end of the waveguide .",
    "the sample is positioned with its flat face parallel and very close to the endwall such that it experiences spatially uniform fields over its dimensions .",
    "a second metallic reference sample of known absorption is placed in an electrically equivalent position that serves to calibrate the absolute field strength , which varies considerably across the frequency range due to standing waves in the transmission line .",
    "this technique has provided a very sensitive means of measuring the broadband surface resistance spectrum in superconducting crystals over the range 0.5  ghz to 21  ghz , permitting the first exploration of the detailed low temperature conductivity line shape in a number of compounds.@xcite the conductivity spectrum @xmath69 can be extracted very simply from @xmath67 using eq .",
    "[ eqn : rx ] .",
    "our full analysis is slightly more detailed , allowing for the small frequency dependence of the penetration depth that comes from thermally excited quasiparticles .    a very convincing verification of the results from multiple sets of experimental apparatus is provided by a comparison of the broadband @xmath70 data with measurements of the _ same sample _ in five different superconducting resonators .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] , the agreement between the experiments is excellent . in each of the six experiments the absolute value of @xmath33",
    "is determined to better than 10% , with the principle uncertainty coming from the calibration procedure .",

    "the bilayer cuprate compound yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2  has the distinct advantage that it has a stoichiometric cation composition with a very low level of cross - substitution , less than one part in @xmath73 .",
    "tunable hole doping of the cuo@xmath0 planes is achieved by varying the oxygen content of cuo chain layers , which act as a reservoir for oxygen dopants . however , the chains add the complication of an extra one - dimensional conduction channel that acts in parallel with the two - dimensional channel associated with the cuo@xmath0  planes .",
    "varying the oxygen content of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2  usually occurs at the expense of introducing off - plane disorder .",
    "fortunately there are several highly - ordered phases for the chain oxygen atoms that are stable at room temperature , and we exploit two of these here .",
    "the first is the fully - oxygenated yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8 , with ortho - i order in which _ every _ cuo chain is nearly completely filled and @xmath74  k. optimal doping for yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2  occurs at @xmath75 , corresponding to @xmath76  k. increasing the oxygen content beyond 6.93 reduces @xmath15 . since adding oxygen to the cuo chains is a diffusion - limited process , filling a millimetre - sized crystal beyond @xmath77 is impractical . for this publication , we have combined measurements on two different ortho - i crystals to provide a complete data set : sample  # 1 has @xmath15=89  k and sample  # 2 has @xmath15=91  k. the two samples provided very similar results but with some interesting differences that we attribute to the small difference in oxygen contained in the cuo chains .",
    "the other ordered phase we have studied is ortho - ii , in which the cuo chains _ alternate _ between full and empty .",
    "ortho - ii order is seen to exist over a wide range of doping , from @xmath78 to @xmath79 , however the most complete chain filling has been found to occur at @xmath80.@xcite the particular sample used for the present microwave study is very close to this , having @xmath81 and @xmath82  k.    figure [ fig : figure2 ] presents fixed - frequency microwave absorption measurements for a high quality crystal of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath9  made in a geometry where the screening currents are along either the @xmath37 or the @xmath38 crystal direction .",
    "the surface resistance is seen to drop rapidly , by up to four orders of magnitude , on cooling below @xmath15 , and displays a strong frequency dependence in the microwave range .",
    "much of the frequency dependence of @xmath33 is due to the factor of @xmath83 in eq .",
    "[ eqn : rx ] that results from screening by the superfluid .",
    "the remaining frequency dependence is due to the quasiparticle conductivity @xmath34 itself .",
    "the raw surface impedance data for fully doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8  have already been published and are not reproduced here.@xcite",
    "for a superconductor , the conductivity can be expressed as the sum of two conduction mechanisms acting in parallel : one due to charge carriers in the superconducting condensate ( denoted by @xmath84 ) and another due to thermally excited quasiparticles ( denoted by @xmath85 ) : @xmath86 the superfluid conductivity can be parameterized using the london phenomenology:@xcite @xmath87 where the temperature dependent superfluid spectral weight is represented by @xmath88 .",
    "this is an experimentally accessible quantity that is related to the london penetration depth in the following manner : @xmath89    the goal of this work is to explore the phenomenology of the superconducting state without assuming a microscopic model for the conductivity of thermally excited _",

    "[ eqn : zs ] , to obtain both the spectral lineshape and its temperature dependence",
    ". this process would be straightforward if we could measure both @xmath33 and @xmath35 at each frequency .",
    "however , measurements of the frequency dependence of @xmath35 are very difficult to carry out , for reasons that are closely related to the difficulty in measuring _ absolute _ penetration depth at a fixed frequency . to carry out the analysis of our broadband data , we therefore use measurements of @xmath35 at one low frequency only ( 1  ghz ) and extend this to higher frequencies using a self - consistent analysis of the surface resistance data .",
    "we are helped greatly by the fact that the frequency dependence of @xmath36 is very slight , due to the dominant contribution from the superfluid .",
    "the small frequency dependence of @xmath36 is due solely to the weak screening contributions from the thermally excited quasiparticles .",

    "while this particular model has proven useful for interpreting qualitative features of the electrodynamics , there is no _ a priori _ reason why it should model the quasiparticle conductivity correctly .",
    "in fact , broadband measurements demonstrate that the lineshape is distinctly _ non_-drude - like.@xcite a very clear and simple demonstration of this is obtained by plotting @xmath94 at fixed temperature @xmath11 , as shown in figure fig .",

    "the similarities and differences between the data shown for yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath9and yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8  offer insight into the nature of the in - plane anisotropy in this system , the doping dependence of the inelastic scattering , and the elastic scattering of nodal quasiparticles by defects .",
    "both materials show a very broad component in @xmath69 in the direction parallel to the cuo chains , which is presumably due to the quasi - one - dimensional fermi surface sheet derived from a cuo chain band hybridized with the cuo@xmath0  plane bands .",
    "atkinson showed that such a mechanism is needed to explain the anisotropy of the in - plane superfluid density.@xcite he also needed to invoke strong pair - breaking by o defects to explain the lack of a low temperature upturn in the @xmath38-axis superfluid density , an upturn expected if the superconductivity on the chains arises from the proximity effect .",
    "this strong scattering would likely explain the broad @xmath69 spectrum of quasiparticle excitations on this fermi surface sheet .",
    "an important and puzzling issue arises by examining the anisotropy of the transport relaxation rate and temperature dependent spectral weight . in the cuprates ,",
    "the cuo@xmath0 plane currents are carried by nodal quasiparticles .",
    "since the gap nodes lie close to the diagonals of the brilloiun zone , these excitations carry both @xmath37 and @xmath38-axis currents .",
    "we might therefore expect the transport relaxation rate , as measured by the width of the @xmath139 spectra , to be @xmath37@xmath38 plane isotropic .",
    "this is indeed the case in the ortho - i sample : the conductivity spectra have approximately the same width in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 directions , and the temperature - dependent spectral weights agree to within experimental uncertainty .",
    "the latter conclusion is sensitive to the choice of @xmath140 , but we conclude that ortho - i yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8  is well described by a 3-band model consisting of a cuo chain - like band acting in parallel with the bonding / antibonding cuo@xmath0 plane bands . however , the ortho - ii results present a surprising contrast .",
    "the widths of the conductivity spectra and the temperature - dependent quasiparticle spectral weights differ by a factor of two between the @xmath37 and @xmath38 directions .",
    "one of the possible explanations for this anisotropy may be the effect of ortho - ii ordering on the electronic structure of the material .",
    "ortho - ii ordering doubles the unit cell of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2  in the @xmath37-axis direction , and can therefore substantially alter the fermi surface topology with respect to the fully - doped compound .",
    "in particular , bascones _",
    "et al . _ have predicted that ortho - ii ordering can generate two new quasi - one - dimensional bands that are derived entirely from the cuo@xmath0 plane state.@xcite this might generate additional nodal quasiparticles derived from the new quasi - one - dimensional bands , increasing the @xmath134 anisotropy of the in - plane conductivity .",
    "we leave this issue as an open question for future work in this area , and as a feature that must be kept in mind for any theoretical treatment of this phase .",
    "figure [ fig : figure10 ] demonstrates that the rapid collapse of the inelastic scattering below @xmath15 occurs in both of these highly - ordered phases of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "one theoretical proposal treats the opening of a gap in the spectrum of excitations that scatters the nodal quasiparticles , including the key detail that umklapp processes are needed to relax charge currents.@xcite the @xmath11 dependence of the damping @xmath141 is consistent with exponentially - activated behaviour , the expectation for umklapp scattering .",
    "the activated behaviour arises because there is a minimum threshold quasiparticle wave vector that satisfies the umklapp requirement .",
    "the new results for the ortho - ii phase yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath9  are qualitatively consistent with this picture .",
    "the damping rises even more quickly , broadening @xmath101 out of the microwave range by 20 k. this could result not only from the lower @xmath15 , but also because changes in the fermi surface at this lower doping would enhance umklapp processes by moving the required excitation closer to the nodes as compared to yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , a quantitative fit is difficult because of the strong linear term in the elastic scattering in this sample .",
    "quasiparticle scattering in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8  and yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath9  samples is likely dominated by elastic scattering below about 20 and 10  k , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the lowest temperature spectrum at 1.3 k has the cusp - like shape expected for weak scattering.@xcite however , the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath9  spectra retain the weak - scattering cusp - like form up to higher temperatures where inelastic scattering takes over , but the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8  spectra take on a more drude like shape and do not show the temperature independent @xmath142 expected for weak limit scattering .",
    "one possible explanation is that the scatterers are neither in the born nor the unitary limit , something also suggested by recent thermal conductivity measurements.@xcite in such a case , the shape and temperature evolution depend on the strength of the scattering , the density of scatterers and the size of the superconducting energy gap .",
    "detailed fits to the spectra will be the subject of future work , but one can qualitatively state that the scattering in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8  appears to be slightly farther from the born limit than it is in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath9 .",
    "it has also been suggested that the nearly linear temperature dependence of @xmath143 for any given fixed frequency @xmath144 at low t is also a consequence of intermediate scattering phase shifts.@xcite    in attempting to generate a microscopic description of conductivity data many researchers have focused on models of quasiparticle scattering from point - like defects .",
    "this is a logical starting point , but it has become apparent that such models are incapable of simultaneously accounting for the observed spectral lineshapes and the significant amount of oscillator strength that remains uncondensed at 1.2 k , more than would be expected as the conductivity evolves towards the @xmath145 limit .",
    "et al . _ tried to invoke intermediate scattering phase shifts for point scatterers to explain experimental results , but did not present a quantitative set of parameters that could simultaneously describe the spectral shape , its temperature dependence , and the uncondensed oscillator strength at 1.2 k.@xcite this problem is widespread and far more severe in other cuprates . in @xmath146 for instance there is much greater uncondensed oscillator strength observed in both terahertz measurements of films @xcite and microwave measurements of single crystals.@xcite in these cases , residual oscillator strength as high as 30 % of the superfluid density was observed , compared to the few percent seen in the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2  samples discussed here .",
    "motivated by the spectroscopic inhomogeneity observed in scanning tunneling spectroscopy,@xcite orenstein @xcite has suggested that this oscillator strength was due to a collective mode in the presence of inhomogeneity .",
    "more recently , nunner _",
    "_ have been driven by tunneling results to suggest that randomly distributed interstitial o dopants may be the source of the electronic inhomogeneity in @xmath146.@xcite this has suggested that rather than focussing on point scatterers , a better approach is to study extended scatterers , which give rise to slowly varying potentials on the cuo@xmath0 planes created by off - plane disorder .",
    "such models start from knowledge of the actual defects in the system and have had considerable success in fitting both the @xmath146 microwave data and the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8  data presented here .",
    "the basic suggestion is that off - plane disorder is a controlling feature of all cuprates and that even though the relative amount disorder is much smaller in the oxygen - ordered phases of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , it still plays an important role in understanding its electronic properties .",
    "the new spectroscopic data presented here , together with that on other materials@xcite provides a testing ground for the different models : collective modes in an inhomogeneous superconductor , point scatterers with intermediate phase shifts , and scattering by off - plane disorder ."
