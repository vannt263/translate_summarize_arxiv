    "this paper is concerned with the nonlinear klein - gordon equation @xmath0 with radial data .",

    "let us briefly review some basic well - known facts concerning the well - posedness of   in the energy space ( this does not require any radial assumption ) .",
    "[ thm : basic ] the nlkg equation   is locally wellposed for data in @xmath3 in the usual ( duhamel formulation ) sense and the energy is conserved .",

    "if an energy solution exists on @xmath4 with @xmath5 maximal , then necessarily @xmath6 ; if @xmath7 and @xmath8 , then @xmath9 scatters to zero as @xmath10 . finally , smooth data lead to smooth solutions .",
    "the proof is a straightforward application of energy and strichartz estimates , see for example  @xcite . in the defocusing case one has global existence and scattering to zero for all data , see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", @xmath11 is the phase ( energy ) space , and @xmath12 stands for the @xmath13-strichartz norm associated with  , respectively , on the time - interval @xmath14 .",
    "let us now define the forward scattering set .",
    "the forward scattering set is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the nonlinear evolution of the nlkg equation .",
    "the following properties of @xmath17 follow from the main wellposedness theorem above and some simple perturbative arguments .",
    "the set @xmath17 enjoys the following properties :    * @xmath18 , a small ball in  @xmath19 * @xmath17 is an open set * @xmath20 * @xmath17 is path - connected .    for the third property one can use that solutions of negative energy blowup in finite time , see  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the following questions pose themselves quite naturally now :    1 .",
    "is @xmath21 bounded in @xmath19 ? 2 .",
    "what does @xmath22 look like , is it a smooth manifold , or can it be very rough ? 3 .",
    "if @xmath22 is a smooth manifold , does it separate a region of finite time blowup from one of global existence , at least locally ?",
    "what is the dynamical behavior of solutions starting on @xmath22 ?",
    "are there any special solutions with data on @xmath22 ?",
    "some partial answers to these questions were found in  @xcite for   with radial data ( the @xmath23 case with nonradial data was treated in  @xcite , the cubic nls equation in @xmath23 in  @xcite , and the critical wave equation in @xmath24 in  @xcite , whereas the one - dimensional case is studied in  @xcite ) . to be more specific , it was found that the answer to ( 1 ) is `` no '' .",
    "in fact , there exists a curve in @xmath19 connecting @xmath25 to  @xmath26 and such that a solution starting from an arbitrary point on that curve belongs to @xmath17 .",
    "the answers to the other questions are formulated in terms of the _ ground state _ @xmath27 .",

    "in particular , data of negative energy blow up in finite time , and @xmath20 .    the invariance is a fairly immediate consequence of the fact that the variational problem @xmath43 has @xmath44 as the unique solutions ( up to translation ) .",
    "furthermore , in @xmath42 one has @xmath45 whence theorem  [ thm : basic ] implies global existence .",
    "the blowup in @xmath41 follows from a concavity argument .",
    "very recently , ibrahim , masmoudi , nakanishi  @xcite proved that solutions in @xmath42 scatter to zero as @xmath46 .",
    "thus , @xmath47 . returning to describing the partial answers to questions ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) above , introduce @xmath48 then the following was shown in @xcite , @xcite :    [ thm : ns ] for some small @xmath49 one has    * @xmath50 is a smooth , co - dimension one manifold * it does separate a region of scattering to zero as @xmath51 from one exhibiting finite time blowup * any data from @xmath50 lead to global solutions in forward time which scatter to @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an energy solution of the free klein - gordon equation .",
    "these results are for radial data , see  @xcite for a version with nonradial data .",
    "furthermore , the aforementioned references contain a description of the boundary @xmath50 as the center - stable manifold associated with @xmath54 in the sense of bates , jones  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the stable ( and unstable ) manifolds are one - dimensional and are described in the terms of the threshold solutions found by duyckaerts , merle in the energy critical case  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a well - known consequence of theorem  [ thm : trap ] is the instability of @xmath27 .",
    "more precisely , in any neighborhood of @xmath54 in @xmath19 we can find data which lead to finite time blowup as well as global existence , respectively . to see this",
    ", we remark that the linearized operator @xmath55 has a single negative eigenvalue , the ground state .",
    "it is evident that @xmath56 has negative spectrum since @xmath57 let @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "for further discussion of the spectral properties of @xmath56 and @xmath61 , see @xcite for the one - dimensional case , as well as  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.3 ) , @xcite , @xcite for the three - dimensional case . expanding the stationary energy @xmath62 and the functional @xmath63 around @xmath27 yields @xmath64 as @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , by theorem  [ thm : trap ] , data @xmath66 blow up for @xmath49 small and scatter to zero for @xmath67 small .",
    "the same holds for @xmath68 .",
    "expanding further , we set @xmath69 where @xmath70",
    ". then @xmath71 and @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "since @xmath74 , we conclude that the only way to decrease the energy below @xmath75 is through @xmath76",
    ". moreover , in a @xmath77-neighborhood of @xmath78 in the @xmath79-plane the set @xmath80 looks like @xmath81 at least up to cubic corrections .",
    "needless to say that there are other important aspects of the problem which we do not touch upon in the present work .",
    "for instance , it is known @xcite that the blowup rate is determined by the ode @xmath82 , very similar to the analogous situation for the wave equation @xcite .",
    "at the core of all numerical work lie second order finite difference schemes ( both explicit and implicit schemes were used ) which solve the cubic nlkg equation with radial data .",
    "such schemes are quite standard and are discussed in more detail below . in order to study the set @xmath17 for   numerically , the authors applied these solvers to data of the form @xmath83 or @xmath84 where @xmath85 are fixed radial functions , such as gaussians , exponentials , with or without oscillatory factors ( typical ones are @xmath86 or @xmath87 ) . here",
    "@xmath88 runs over a fine grid of points from a suitable rectangle . if numerical blowup is found , which simply means that the @xmath89 norm on some fixed ball becomes very large in finite time , something like @xmath90 times larger than the norm of the initial data , the pair @xmath88 is stored in a blowup file ; if the @xmath89-norm becomes very small on some ball ( say , falls below @xmath91 of the size of the data ) , and remains small , then the pair @xmath88 is regarded as `` dispersive '' .",
    "if no decision of this type can be reached up to some prescribed maximum number of time steps , the data set is characterized as `` indecisive '' .",
    "note that the latter case occurs if @xmath83 falls exactly on the center - stable manifold ( an extremely unlikely event ; however , one may come very near to this manifold , which then requires a large number of time - steps in order to reach the blowup / dispersion decision ) .    while this characterization is somewhat delicate ( for example , it is not apriori clear why solutions could not blow up on a sphere of large radius , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the authors have found empirically that it leads to consistent and meaningful results ( more on this can be found in section  [ sec : resultsd3 ] ) .",
    "the numerical calculations were performed with difference schemes applied to the equation @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "the choice of the difference scheme is a somewhat delicate matter . for the free wave equation",
    "there are several schemes , accurate to second or higher orders , which are known to converge  @xcite . for the nonlinear case , especially with the singularity on the right - hand side of",
    ", there does not appear to be much known in terms of the convergence of difference schemes for  .",
    "the first , implicit , second order accurate difference scheme which we use is due to strauss , vazquez  @xcite ( which they introduced for the defocusing equation ) and reads as follows : @xmath94 \\\\",
    "& \\quad   - \\frac{1}{4(j\\delta r)^{2 } } \\big [ ( v_{j}^{n+1})^{3 } + ( v_{j}^{n+1})^{2 } v_{j}^{n-1 } + v_{j}^{n+1 } ( v_{j}^{n-1})^{2 } + ( v_{j}^{n-1})^{3}\\big ] = 0   \\end{split}\\ ] ] the nonlinear term being @xmath95 with @xmath96 . here , we use the standard shorthand notation @xmath97 .",
    "the discretization steps @xmath98 are chosen such that @xmath99 ; in particular , the courant - friedichs - lewy condition is satisfied .",
    "moreover , typical values of @xmath100 are on the order of @xmath101 . for the implementation",
    ", one applies a newton scheme to solve for @xmath102 using as a starting guess the explicit version of   in which all but the first occurrences of @xmath102 are replaced by @xmath103 , say .",
    "note that due to the focusing sign the newton scheme may become degenerate , which means that the derivative of the polynomial of @xmath102 as defined by   can vanish or almost vanish .",
    "however , one checks that this can only happen if @xmath104 where @xmath105 if the latter case occurs , then we terminate with a decision of blowup . to calculate the solution of   on a rectangle @xmath106 we use a space - time grid on the larger rectangle @xmath107 , since the latter is the smallest rectangle containing the domain of dependence of  @xmath108 .",
    "the scheme conserves the discrete energy @xmath109   \\end{split}\\ ] ] and is stable and thus convergent  @xcite for the free equation .",
    "the second , explicit , second order accurate difference scheme is as follows : @xmath110 it is easier to implement , and runs faster since no newton iteration is required .",
    "it is still stable and convergent for the free equation .",
    "while it does not conserve the discrete energy  , the authors have found that it does so _ approximately _ in those examples which they considered .",
    "a theoretical comparison of the difference schemes   and   appears to be quite challenging .",
    "however , after running numerous computations with these schemes the authors have found that they lead to the same conclusions as far as the dispersion / blowup dichotomy is concerned ( for example , in terms of the pictures appearing in the following section ) . however ,",
    "as far as the actual blowup solutions are concerned , significant differences can be found near the blowup time .",
    "but we reiterate that in all cases checked by the authors the qualitative behavior comes out the same , which means that the appearance of the sets in section  [ sec : resultsd3 ] comes out the same .",
    "other than running their computations with both and   ( the latter typically with finer resolution due to its faster execution ) , and then repeating the calculations with @xmath111 , the authors have used the _ bisection method _ as a means of checking the validity of figures such as those appearing in section  [ sec : resultsd3 ] .",
    "this refers to a process in which two data pairs @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the first leading to blowup , and the second to dispersion , are chosen in close proximity to each other .",
    "then one bisects the line segment joining them , tests the midpoint for blowup / dispersion , and then continues with the line segment connecting the midpoint to either @xmath114 or @xmath115 , so that the endpoints of this new segment exhibit opposite behaviors . iterating this procedure until machine precision is reached ,",
    "the authors have found that one obtains data pairs which `` almost '' lie on the center - stable manifold .",
    "this means that the time evolution of these data exhibit `` metastable '' behavior , or `` quasinormal '' ringing . the latter term is used in the theoretical physics literature which concerns itself with the decay of dispersive tails , as they appear for example in the context of the so - called price law .",
    "see also bizo et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .    finally , as an additional check",
    ", the authors have also run computations with a code that uses a compactified radial coordinate .",
    "this approach is quite common in the physics literature and it allows one ( at least in principle ) to follow the evolution up to spatial infinity which is important to rule out the possibility of late time blowup .",
    "fortunately , such an unpleasant phenomenon does not seem to occur and the klein - gordon equation under consideration is well - behaved in this respect .",
    "as far as the coding is concerned , the authors used the `` c''-language .",
    "the computations leading to the results of the following section were carried out on two machines : ( 1 ) a macpro capable of running 16 processes in parallel . in that case",
    ", the authors relied on the `` fork()''-command to distribute the @xmath88-loop over 50 ( typically ) parallel processes at any given moment .",

    "in order to explore questions ( 2)-(4 ) above numerically , the authors investigated solutions generated by data sets @xmath116 where @xmath117 are some simple fixed radial rapidly decaying functions , such as gaussians , exponentials , possibly multiplied with oscillatory factors , and @xmath118 are chosen on a case to case basis .     numerical results for @xmath119 and @xmath120,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.6% ]   numerical results for @xmath119 and @xmath120,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.6% ]    in the examples shown below , @xmath85 are smooth , including near the origin ( in fact , they are analytic ) .",
    "once a choice of @xmath117 is made , the numbers , @xmath121 , @xmath122 are then determined by trial and error ( weighing numerical cost against the desire to obtain a large enough section of @xmath17 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "discretizing @xmath88 by a sufficiently fine rectangular grid , and solving at each grid - point by the difference schemes of the previous section , one then colors each grid - point according to whether the numerical solution appears to exhibit blowup ( it is kept blank ) or scattering to zero ( colored red ) for large times .    in this fashion ,",
    "one obtains two - dimensional sections of @xmath17 .",

    "the right - hand image of that figure has very similar features .",
    "in particular , `` spikes '' and a smooth boundary ( we discuss these spikes in more details below ) .",
    "note that in these figures we only consider positive values of  @xmath125 , which suffices by the reflection symmetry about the origin .",
    "the blue @xmath41 region does not intersect the rectangle chosen in the right - hand image of figure  [ fig:1.2 ] , and thus does not appear in there .",
    "a common feature of figures  [ fig:1.1 ] , [ fig:1.2 ] is that the boundary of the red region appears as a union of smooth curves .",

    ", the image on the right - hand side of figure  [ fig:1.4 ] as well as those in figure  [ fig:1.5 ] show three zooms with successively higher resolutions near the round tip of the left - hand image of figure  [ fig:1.4 ] .",
    "with some patience the reader will not only be able to find the filaments that are visible in one scale again at the next finer scale , but also between those and the solid red region a very thin new filament emerging .",
    "note that the green color in the three zooms signifies the  indecisive \" points where the algorithm was not able to decide between blowup and global existence .",
    "it is this indecisive region that gets resolved at the next finer scale , with a new filament emerging from it .",
    "numerical results for @xmath140 and one zoom near the boundary , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.6% ]   numerical results for @xmath140 and one zoom near the boundary , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.6% ]    the zooms were computed on the kraken supercomputer at the nics , which is part of the teragrid .",
    "the coarse appearance of the third zoom , shown on the right - hand side of figure  [ fig:1.4 ] is due to the limitations on the computing time available to the authors .    at this point",
    ", it is completely unclear whether or not infinitely many of these `` bands '' emerge out of the scattering region .",
    "of course , this would imply that @xmath141 is _ not _ a smooth manifold  perhaps a somewhat counter - intuitive assertion .",
    "a very visible common feature of all figures of this section ( excluding of course the zooms ) are the thin `` spikes '' that emanate from the bulk of the red region ( the forward scattering set @xmath22 ) .",
    "even though current theory can not touch such phenomena as these `` spikes '' , we now offer some  admittedly daring  explanations as to why they might appear .",
    "first , let us assume the _ scattering hypothesis _ which states that solutions starting from data that fall _ exactly _ onto the boundary exist globally in forward time and scatter to either @xmath27 or @xmath142 .",
    "in addition to the proof of this hypothesis in  @xcite for energies which are at most slightly larger than that of the ground state , circumstantial evidence gathered by means of the bisection method described in the previous section lends some credence to this conjecture .",
    "however , if there are indeed infinitely many filaments in figures  [ fig:1.3 ] , [ fig:1.4 ] then it is very difficult to guess what the dynamical implications might be ; in particular , it is hard to conjecture ( or simulate for that matter ) what kind of asymptotic states might be associated with such a complicated boundary .    be it as it may ,",
    "let us assume the `` scattering hypothesis '' .",
    "then the boundary splits into two open sets which scatter to either @xmath27 or @xmath142 under the nonlinear flow ( for convenience , let us call these _ positive _ and _ negative _ boundaries , respectively ) .",
    "the openness of these sets is another leap of faith , but a natural one : it simply expresses that the scattering properties should be stable _ relative to small perturbations inside the boundary_. if this is so then these sets will not meet up smoothly but rather avoid each other .",
    "if a two - dimensional section does indeed display smooth boundary curves as in the numerical pictures , then the positive and negative curves can not approach each other within a compact set .",
    "therefore , they have to move off to infinity .",
    "note that this does not exclude that two boundary curves form a `` tube '' of some finite thickness , rather than a spike .",
    "such a tube , however , is extremely unlikely since it would insinuate something like a uniform stability property at larger and larger energies .",
    "two further zooms near the boundary of fig  [ fig:1.4],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.5% ]   two further zooms near the boundary of fig  [ fig:1.4],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.5% ]    in this context , it would be very instructive to consider the schrdinger equation since the soliton manifold in that case is connected ( whereas for the nlkg equation it is discrete : @xmath143 ) .",
    "if the previous explanation has any merit , then one might expect that spikes do not form in the schrdinger case .",
    "some preliminary numerical experiments by the authors appear to confirm that . more precisely , two - dimensional sections of the scattering region for the cubic radial focusing nls equation in @xmath144 appear as round and smooth shapes  at least in the very limited number of examples the authors computed for nls .",
    "we remark that the `` spikes '' should not be confused with the one - dimensional stable and unstable manifolds emanating from @xmath44 ( or rather , neighborhoods thereof ) . indeed",
    ", those manifolds would be only visible in very carefully chosen curved two - dimensional sections passing through @xmath44 , and finding such a section would be a zero probability event in any reasonable sense .",
    "but this contradicts the fact that the spikes appear in each of the numerically computed images ( but not in the zooms , of course ) that the authors produced .",
    "needless to say , it is essentially impossible to hit the boundary exactly just by sampling a grid of data as we do to produce the figures of this section .",
    "nevertheless , one can test the aforementioned scattering hypothesis by means of the `` bisection method '' described in section  [ sec : code ] , see also bizo et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "this refers to taking two data pairs , one from the red region , and another from the white region which are in close proximity of each other .",
    "then one numerically computes the solution starting from the midpoint between these two points , tests for blowup / dispersion , and continues bisecting the interval whose endpoints exhibit opposite behaviors . in this way one obtains data that have a clear tendency of approaching either @xmath27 or @xmath142 for large times , albeit with possible oscillations about these two states , followed by eventual blowup or dispersion .",
    "the aforementioned oscillations are referred to as `` quasinormal ringing '' in the physics literature , see for example bizo et al .    to the authors",
    ", this bisection process also provides a strong check of the accuracy and validity of the numerically computed region @xmath17 . indeed ,",
    "if the initial data pair for the bisection process does not lie close to , and on opposite sides of , the _ actual _ @xmath22  which is what the figures claim  then the bisection process would not converge in the described fashion .",

    "the left - hand image is a planar section as defined above , and it provides ( after the reflection about the origin ) an example with _ six spikes _ rather than two as in the previous examples .",
    "a priori , there seems to be no reason to assume that the number of spikes could not be arbitrarily large .",
    "the image on the right - hand side of figure  [ fig:1.5 ] is different from all those previously considered in so far as _ it is not planar_. more specifically , it shows a section produced by @xmath146 with @xmath147 .     a series of sections as in with increasing @xmath148,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.5% ]   a series of sections as in with increasing @xmath148,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.5% ]   a series of sections as in with increasing @xmath148,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.5% ]   a series of sections as in with increasing @xmath148,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.5% ]   a series of sections as in with increasing @xmath148,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.5% ]   a series of sections as in with increasing @xmath148,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.5% ]    the final series of numerical experiments which we present here concerns _ three - parameter families_. this refers to data of the form @xmath149 , say , where @xmath150 are parameters which are chosen in some finite range .",
    "for fixed @xmath148 these data generate a two - dimensional section as shown in the previous images , but as @xmath148 varies one obtains a whole family of sections which move `` continuously '' ( at least , if @xmath148 changes only by very little ) . the specific data leading to figures  [ fig:1.7 ] , [ fig:1.8 ] are @xmath151 where @xmath148 is in the vicinity of @xmath152 , @xmath153 and up .",

    "a much finer resolution was obtained on the supercomputer kraken at the nics , leading to the sequence of images shown in figure  [ fig:1.8 ] .",
    "they are zoom - ins into the area where the pinching takes place as shown in figure  [ fig:1.7 ] , and depict the process of merging and pulling apart more clearly .",
    "the uneven appearance of some of the upper boundaries in the images of figures  [ fig:1.8 ] is due to the fact that in most computations the so - called wall - time was reached which then leads to termination .",
    "interpreting these images is a delicate issue , as they are two - dimensional sections of an infinite - dimensional object , namely @xmath17 .",
    "note carefully that they certainly _ do not _ imply singularity formation of the actual boundary @xmath22 as can be seen from the example of the one - sheeted hyperboloid in @xmath144 , say with rotation axis given by the @xmath154-coordinate direction .",
    "then as the planes @xmath155 slice through this hyperboloid they will produce an image given by @xmath156 at the moment of tangency to the waist line .",
    "this is what seems to happen between the fourth and fifth image of figure  [ fig:1.8 ] .",
    "the authors hope that this note will encourage further numerical , or analytical , investigations of the set @xmath17 , both for the nlkg equation in various dimensions and with various powers in the nonlinearity , as well as other nonlinear dispersive equations such as the nonlinear schrdinger equation",
    ". it would be highly desirable to employ different , and possibly more sophisticated , numerical algorithms .",
    "for example , one could try the symplectic difference schemes developed by duncan  @xcite and reich  @xcite , or a different approach altogether .",
    "the most important problem arising in this context is to decide whether or not the boundary of the forward scattering region can indeed become singular at larger energies . and",
    "if so , in what ways the boundary may degenerate . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the only evidence we have found that points towards the possibility of some sort of singular behavior is the emergence of more and more filaments from the scattering region .",
    "the next step would then be to see if any possible degeneration of the boundary is reflected by anomalies in the _ actual wave dynamics_. upon request the authors will email all numerical data which they have produced in the course of this work ( which is considerably larger than that presented here ) .",
    "however , hopefully other researchers will carry out their experiments with data and numerical solvers of their own choosing .",
    "it seems most important to conduct a systematic and exhaustive study of the boundary of @xmath17 by means of the bisection method which we discussed above in order to test the `` scattering hypothesis '' . in the process",
    "one can also test the accuracy of the numerically computed two - dimensional sections , particularly if a different solver is employed for the bisection than the one used for the computation of the two - dimensional slices of  @xmath17 .",
    "more work needs to be done on three - parameter families .",
    "in particular , it would be of interest to study how the `` bubbles '' in figure  [ fig:1.3 ] evolve as a third parameter is being changed .",
    "furthermore , one could use such a three parameter family to obtain a two - dimensional section of _ constant energy_. and thirdly , it would be very appealing to produce three - dimensional images of the intersections of @xmath17 with a cube in @xmath144 ( this requires substantial computational resources ) .",
    "the issue here is not so much to produce more pictures , but to pinpoint various phenomena relating to the topology of @xmath22 and _ then to connect them to the actual wave dynamics_. an example of this is the aforementioned _ scattering hypothesis _ but one can also ask about the dynamical implications ( if any ) of the filaments as they appear in figures  [ fig:1.4 ] and  [ fig:1.5 ] .",
    "finally , it would be interesting  as well as challenging  to consider the same questions that we pursue here for other equations , such as the one - dimensional nlkg , the schrdinger , as well as the energy critical wave equations ( i.e. , with @xmath157 nonlinearity ) in @xmath144 .",
    "the one - dimensional equation has considerably less dispersion than the three - dimensional one , so it is perhaps somewhat more delicate to rely on the numerics in that case . in this context , one can also investigate the dependence on the power of the nonlinearity , see bizon  @xcite for such considerations in connection with the aforementioned `` quasi - periodic ringing '' and the emergence of a threshold resonance at power @xmath158 .",
    "it is natural to consider even data as in  @xcite , but general data are also important , of course , and considerably more challenging numerically . as for the schrdinger and critical wave equations , these are numerically ( as well as analytically ) harder and the authors have done only preliminary exploratory work on them as far as the numerics is concerned .",
