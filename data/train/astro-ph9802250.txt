    "clusters of galaxies have been extensively observed in radio , optical and x  ray bands .",
    "furthermore recent and future observational facilities in mm and submm bands , such as the scuba ( submillimeter common - user bolometer array ) , the japanese lmsa ( large millimeter and submillimeter array ) project and the european planck mission are expected to open the submm window to observe clusters of galaxies via the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich ( sz ) effect ( sunyaev , zeldovich 1972 ) in addition to the rayleigh - jeans region of the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) where the sz temperature decrement is reported for about a dozen of clusters ( e.g. , rephaeli 1995 ; kobayashi , sasaki , suto 1996 ) .",
    "since the intensity of the sz effect does not suffer from the @xmath10 diminishing factor unlike x  ray surface brightness , observations in mm and submm bands are much more advantageous for clusters , especially at high @xmath11 , than those in optical and x - ray bands ( barbosa et al .",
    "1996 ; silverberg et al . 1997 ; kitayama , sasaki , suto 1998 ) .",
    "as extensively discussed in previous literatures ( silk , white 1978 ; sunyaev , zeldovich 1980 ; birkinshaw , hughes , arnaud 1991 ; rephaeli , lahav 1991 ; inagaki , suginohara , suto 1995 ; kobayashi , sasaki , suto 1996 ; holzapfel et al .",
    "1997 ; kitayama , sasaki , suto 1998 ) , one can then combine these multi - band observations of high@xmath11 clusters to determine the cosmological parameters and the peculiar velocity of clusters . these procedures , however , usually assume that the gas of clusters is isothermal and spherical , while all the observed clusters do exhibit a departure from the assumption to some extent",
    ". the departure would hamper the reliable estimates of , for instance , the hubble constant @xmath3 and the peculiar velocity @xmath4 . to address the question quantitatively",
    ", we carry out a series of numerical simulations of clusters .",
    "we extract simulated clusters both at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and perform the `` simulated '' observations in x  ray , mm and submm bands .",
    "finally we combine the multi - band information to evaluate the statistical and possible systematic errors of the estimates of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "our present work extends the previous studies of this methodology ( inagaki , suginohara , suto 1995 ; roettiger , stone , mushotzky 1997 ) for @xmath3 and examines uncertainties of the peculiar velocity field as well , paying attention to the projection effect and the evolution of clusters .",
    "as a representative cosmological model , we consider a cold dark matter cosmogony with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the density parameter , @xmath21 is the cosmological constant , @xmath22 is @xmath3 in units of 100km / s / mpc , @xmath23 is the amplitude of the density fluctuation , @xmath24 is the spectral index of the primordial fluctuations , and @xmath25 is the baryon density parameter .",
    "this model satisfies both the cobe normalization and the cluster abundance ( white , efstathiou , frenk 1993 ; kitayama , suto 1997 ) , and also is consistent with the recent indications of no significant evolution of galaxy clusters ( see kitayama , sasaki , suto 1998 for details ) .",
    "the initial conditions of our simulations are generated using the cosmics package by e. bertschinger and the resulting gas and dark matter particle distributions are evolved with the publicly available ap@xmath26m  sph code ( _ hydra _ ) by couchman et al .",
    "the effects of radiative cooling and heating are neglected .",
    "we use the ideal gas equation of state with an adiabatic index @xmath27 .",
    "gravitational forces are softened with a physical softening length of @xmath28kpc .",
    "our simulations proceed in two steps ; first we carry out three low  resolution simulations with @xmath29 particles each for gas and dark matter in a comoving periodic cubic of @xmath30 100 ( one realization ) and 200 ( two realizations ) .",
    "then we identify clusters at @xmath31 using the friend  of  friend algorithm with a bonding length of 0.2 times the mean particle separation .",
    "the virial mass of clusters is computed from all the particles within the virial radius , @xmath32 , from the center of each cluster .",
    "the latter is defined so that the mean density inside becomes @xmath33 , the virialized density at @xmath11 predicted in the spherical non  linear model ( e.g. , white , efstathiou , frenk 1993 ; kitayama , suto 1996 ) , where @xmath34 is the critical density of the universe at redshift of @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting mass function for the identified clusters from the low  resolution simulations is consistent , within a factor of two , with the theoretical press ",
    "schechter mass function ( press , schechter 1974 ) .",
    "considering a somewhat simplified identification scheme adopted here , the agreement is satisfactory and implies that our low ",
    "resolution simulations provide fairly homogeneous and unbiased catalogues of clusters .    from the cluster catalogues constructed by the three low  resolution simulations , we select nine clusters with mass greater than @xmath35",
    ". then we set a box of side 25 ( 5 clusters ) , 50 ( 3 clusters ) or 100 ( 1 cluster ) at the center of each cluster and fill the box with @xmath29 particles each for gas and dark matter which are assigned the same amplitude and phases of perturbation waves as in the initial condition of the low  resolution simulation at @xmath36 .",
    "the nine initial conditions for high  resolution simulations are evolved again with the periodic boundary condition .",
    "the observable quantities of clusters which we consider in this letter are the x  ray surface brightness and the spectral intensities due to the thermal and kinematic sz effect at mm and submm bands .",
    "the x  ray surface brightness of clusters between the frequency bands @xmath37 and @xmath38 for clusters located at @xmath11 is given by the following integral along the line  of  sight ( e.g. , rybicki , lightman 1979 ) : @xmath39\\,n_e^2\\,dl,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 $ ] is the x  ray emissivity in the corresponding frequency band , @xmath41 is the temperature of electron gas and @xmath42 is the number density of electrons . in practice",
    "we adopt the masai model ( masai 1984 ) for @xmath40 $ ] and thus include both metal line emissions and the thermal bremsstrahlung ; the former becomes important for low temperature clusters .    the spectral intensity due to the thermal sz effect",
    "is written as ( e.g. , rephaeli 1995 ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the compton @xmath45parameter : @xmath46 and @xmath47 is a function of @xmath48 : @xmath49.\\ ] ] in the above expressions , @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the boltzmann constant , the electron mass , the thomson cross section , the velocity of light , the planck constant , and the temperature of the cmb , respectively .",
    "the corresponding change of the cmb temperature due to the thermal sz effect is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is given by @xmath58.\\ ] ] the peculiar velocity of a cluster along the line  of  sight , @xmath4 , relative to the cmb rest frame ( defined to be positive for a receding cluster ) produces a kinematic sz effect ( sunyaev , zeldovich 1980 ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is an optical depth of the cluster , and @xmath61 note that the last equality of equation ( [ eqn : dikin ] ) assumes that the temperature profile of the cluster is isothermal , the validity of which we will discuss further in  4.2 .",
    ".physical quantities characterizing the simulated clusters a and b at @xmath62 and @xmath63 : the virial radius in physical lengths ( @xmath64 ) , the total mass within the virial radius ( @xmath65 ) , the number of gas and dark matter particle within the virial radius ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) , the x  ray luminosity in 210 kev band ( @xmath68 ) , the x - ray emission weighted temperature ( @xmath69 ) , the 1dimensional velocity dispersion of dark matter ( @xmath70 ) , @xmath71parameter defined by @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the comoving size of the simulation box .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from the nine simulated clusters in total , we trace their progenitors at @xmath63 .",
    "we choose two clusters , a and b , so as to represent rich and poor clusters in our simulated sample , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] summarizes their properties at @xmath31 and @xmath63 , in which the x  ray emission weighted temperature is defined as @xmath74 n_{e}^2(r ) r^2dr }    { \\displaystyle \\int_0^{r_{\\rm vir } } \\alpha[t_e ] n_{e}^2(r ) r^2dr}.\\ ] ] figure [ fig:2dprofile ] shows the projected profiles of the x - ray surface brightness , temperature decrement , and submm surface brightness at @xmath75 and @xmath63 for the two clusters , and dash - dotted lines show the @xmath71model profiles adopting their fitted parameters .",
    "the energy bands adopted in figure [ fig:2dprofile ] correspond to those of asca ( 2 - 10kev ) in x  ray , noba ( nobeyama bolometer array ; 150ghz ) in mm , and scuba ( 350ghz ) in submm .",
    "note that we are mainly interested in quantifying the _ fractional _ uncertainties in the measurements of @xmath3 and the peculiar velocities . in this sense ,",
    "the absolute magnitude of the value of the @xmath45-parameter is not important ; since our simulations did not include radiative cooling and other scale - dependent physical processes , the results are almost scalable and it seems unlikely that our results presented here change drastically for much larger clusters which have the @xmath45-parameter large enough to be observable in practice .",
    "we plan to come back to the issue with much larger simulations including various scale - dependent physical processes in due course .",
    "if the cluster gas strictly obeys the isothermal @xmath71model : @xmath76^{-3\\beta/2},\\ ] ] then x  ray surface brightness ( eq.[[eqn : x - ray ] ] ) and y - parameter ( eq.[[eqn : yint ] ] ) should be given by @xmath77}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}(1+z)^4 }    \\frac{\\gamma(3\\beta-1/2)}{\\gamma(3\\beta)}n_{\\rm e0}^2\\,r_{\\rm c}\\ ,    \\left[1+\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{r_{\\rm c}/d_{\\rm a}(z)}\\right)^2\\right ]    ^{-3\\beta+\\frac{1}{2}},\\ ] ] and @xmath78^{3\\beta/2 - 1/2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the core radius of the cluster ( in physical lengths ) , @xmath80 is the angular diameter distance to the redshift @xmath11 ( e.g. , birkinshaw , hughes , arnaud 1991 ; kobayashi , sasaki , suto 1996 ) . therefore we attempt the following fits to the projected profiles of clusters a and b : @xmath81^{-3\\beta_{\\rm x}+1/2 } , \\qquad y(\\theta ) \\propto   [ 1 + ( \\theta/\\theta_{\\rm c , y})^2]^{-3\\beta_{\\rm y}/2 + 1/2}.\\ ] ] the results of the fits to equations ( [ eqn : betamodel ] ) and ( [ eqn : betafit ] ) are summarized in figure  [ fig : rcbeta ] , and also plotted in figure [ fig:2dprofile ] ( thick solid and thin dashed lines for cluster a and b , respectively ) . the fits are performed in the range of @xmath82 for equation ( [ eqn : betamodel ] ) , and of @xmath83 for equation ( [ eqn : betafit ] ) . note that the core radii of both clusters decrease with redshift indicating that the clusters are still contracting from @xmath84 to @xmath31 and thus are not in equilibrium at @xmath84 .    while figure [ fig:2dprofile ] clearly illustrates that the separate fits to the @xmath71-model predictions ( eqs.[[eqn : betamodel ] ] and [ [ eqn : betafit ] ] ) are quite successful , the best - fitted values of @xmath79 ( or @xmath85 ) and @xmath71 change substantially depending on whether one uses @xmath86 , @xmath87 , or @xmath88 for the fit .",
    "this should be ascribed to non ",
    "isothermality , asphericity and local clumpiness of clusters . a closer look at figure  [ fig : rcbeta ] implies that the former is more important for clusters at @xmath31 ( because the result is almost insensitive to the line - of - sight directions ) while asphericity and local clumpiness dominate for clusters at @xmath84 .    to understand the above",
    ", we plot the three dimensional profiles both for @xmath89 and @xmath90 in figure [ fig:3dprofile ] .",
    "the integrand of @xmath45 is proportional to @xmath91 ( eq.[[eqn : yint ] ] ) while @xmath92 is more weakly dependent on @xmath93 .",
    "recall that the bolometric emissivity of the thermal bremsstrahlung is proportional to @xmath94 and the inclusion of line emission makes the dependence on @xmath93 even weaker for lower temperature clusters .",
    "thus the gas temperature drop in the central regions , as shown in figure [ fig:3dprofile ] , should increase both @xmath79 and @xmath71 fitted to @xmath87 , and to a lesser extent to @xmath88 compared with those fitted to @xmath86 , which is consistent with the systematic trends for clusters at @xmath31 . in figure [ fig:3dprofile ]",
    "different line - of - sight projections yield a large scatter of @xmath79 and @xmath71 for clusters at @xmath84 indicating that asphericity and clumpiness are more appreciable .",
    "figure [ fig : xsubcont6 ] displays the contours of @xmath95 ( eq.[[eqn : dith ] ] at 150 ghz ) , @xmath96 ( eq.[[eqn : dith ] ] at 350 ghz ) , @xmath92 ( eq.[[eqn : x - ray ] ] at 2  10 kev band ) , and the x - ray emission weighted temperature for clusters a and b. apparently the contours of @xmath97 and @xmath96 are more extended than that of @xmath92 , reflecting that the formers are essentially line - of - sight integrals of @xmath86 rather than of @xmath98 for @xmath92 . also they clearly exhibit that @xmath99 and @xmath96 do not suffer from @xmath10 diminishing effect , which is quite suitable for cluster surveys at high redshifts compared with those in optical and x - rays .",
    "the determination of the hubble constant from cluster observation relies on the prediction of core radius of clusters of galaxies from the @xmath71model fit combining the sz and x  ray fluxes ( eqs.[[eqn : dtovert ] ] , [ [ eqn : sx ] ] and [ [ eqn : betay ] ] ) : @xmath100",

    "the reliability of the estimated hubble constant crucially depends on the relevance of the isothermal @xmath71model . following inagaki , suginohara & suto ( 1995 )",
    ", we examine the distribution of the parameter : @xmath101 for all of the simulated clusters from three orthogonal directions at @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are computed by fitting to the profile of @xmath88 ( eq.[[eqn : sx ] ] ) . the second equality in equation ( [ eqn : fh2d ] ) holds if the isothermal @xmath71-model is exact and the angular diameter distance is approximated as @xmath104 . for comparison , we also compute the similar quantity : @xmath105 using @xmath106 and @xmath107 fitted to the three - dimensional ( spherically averaged ) gas profile ( [ eqn : betamodel ] ) . note that @xmath108 , rather than @xmath109 , should be considered as a measure of the observational uncertainties of @xmath3 since only @xmath102 and @xmath103 are directly estimated from the x - ray observations .",
    "panels ( a ) to ( d ) in figure [ fig : allhist ] show the histograms of @xmath108 and @xmath109 for the nine clusters at @xmath75 and @xmath63 .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is no significant systematic bias for @xmath108 at @xmath31 even though the values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 are fairly different from @xmath106 and @xmath107 . in fact , the mean values of @xmath108 and @xmath109 are close to unity well within the 1@xmath110 statistical errors .",
    "as first discussed by inagaki , suginohara , & suto ( 1995 ) , any temperature structure could bias the value of @xmath3 estimated on the basis of equation ( [ eqn : rcore ] ) .",
    "although our simulated clusters do show some temperature structure , they do not seem to be strong enough to cause significant systematics . on the other hand , clusters at @xmath63 exhibit the systematic underestimate bias of @xmath3 by @xmath5% .",
    "this underestimate would result from the asphericity of the clusters because the values for the same clusters from three line  of  sight directions are significantly different .",
    "the observed sz flux @xmath111 is contributed from both the thermal and kinematic sz effects ( eqs.[[eqn : dith ] ] and [ [ eqn : dikin ] ] ) . by using the different spectral dependence of these effects",
    ", we can estimate the peculiar velocity of the cluster ( sunyaev , zeldovich 1980 ; rephaeli , lahav 1991 ) .",
    "denote the total sz flux in two bands , say @xmath112 and @xmath38 , by @xmath113 , ~(j=1 ~\\mbox{and}~ 2),\\ ] ] where @xmath114 . while the @xmath45-parameter is observable",
    ", @xmath60 is not unless the three - dimensional temperature profile is known independently .",
    "so one may estimate the peculiar velocity using the x - ray emission weighted temperature along the line  of  sight : @xmath115 n_{e}^2(r ) dl } { \\displaystyle \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\alpha[t_e ] n_{e}^2(r ) dl},\\ ] ] as follows : @xmath116 if clusters are isothermal , then @xmath117 and @xmath118 is identical to @xmath4 in equation ( [ eqn : ditotal ] ) . for real clusters , however , the temperature profile is not strictly isothermal and estimates from equation ( [ eqn : pecvel ] ) should be different from @xmath119 depending on the degree of non  isothermality .",
    "if we introduce a quantify the degree of non  isothermality of our simulated clusters : @xmath120 then @xmath121 so @xmath122 can be regarded as a correction factor which relates @xmath123 to the correct peculiar velocity :    we compute @xmath122 for all simulated clusters at @xmath75 and @xmath84 from three orthogonal line  of  sight directions ( figs .",
    "[ fig : allhist]e and f ) . compared with the histograms of @xmath108 and @xmath109 , that of @xmath122 is more centrally concentrated .",
    "this is because @xmath122 is sensitive only to the non  isothermal structure along the line - of - sight while largely free from either the existence of local clumpiness or asphericity unlike @xmath108 and @xmath109",
    ". since @xmath124 has more weights on the high - density central regions , @xmath122 should be less than unity for clusters with central temperature drop as in our simulated ones .",
    "panels ( e ) and ( f ) in figure [ fig : allhist ] indicates that this is the case . in summary ,",
    "the estimates of @xmath4 are fairly reliable with overall fractional uncertainties @xmath125% at @xmath7 and @xmath5% at @xmath84",
    "we have performed a series of numerical simulations with particular attention to the feasibility of estimating the hubble constant @xmath3 and the cluster peculiar velocity @xmath4 via multi - band observations .",
    "let us briefly summarize our conclusions here .",
    "\\(i ) a conventional isothermal @xmath71-model describes well our simulated clusters both in projected x - ray surface brightness and the sz flux ( fig.[fig:2dprofile ] ) as well as the three - dimensional gas density profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3dprofile ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the analytical ( makino , sasaki , suto 1998 ) and numerical work ( eke , navarro , frenk 1998 ) on the basis of the universal density profile of dark matter halo ( navarro , frenk , white 1997 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the best - fit values for the core radius and @xmath71-parameter change significantly depending on whether one attempts to fit the x - ray surface brightness , the sz flux or the gas density ( fig.[fig : rcbeta ] ) .",
    "this reflects the non - isothermal temperature profile , local clumpiness and aspherical gas structure .",
    "\\(iii ) provided that our simulated clusters constitute a representative sample of the observed clusters , the systematic and statistical errors in the estimates of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are relatively small ( fig.[fig : allhist ] ) ; fractional uncertainties of the estimates of @xmath3 amount to @xmath5% mainly due to the departure from the isothermal and spherical gas density distribution .",
    "those of @xmath4 range @xmath125% at @xmath7 and @xmath5% at @xmath84 .",
    "since the three - dimensional temperature structure is very difficult to reconstruct from the projected temperature map ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig:3dprofile ] and [ fig : xsubcont6 ] ) , the correction for the non - isothermality is not easy .",
    "the similar temperature drop in the clusters discussed here was found earlier in simulations by evrard ( 1990 ) and also reported in some observed clusters ( e.g. , ikebe et al .",
    "evrard ( 1990 ) ascribed this to the fact that earlier collapsed gas is only mildly shocked relative to the subsequent infalling gas .",
    "although this is one reasonable interpretation , it could result simply from the shape of gravitational potential ( navarro , frenk , white 1997 ; makino , sasaki , suto 1998 ) or even from the lack of spatial resolution of simulations to represent the shock in the core regions .",
    "therefore results from improved simulations are clearly needed ; a larger number of gas and dark matter particles , @xmath126 and even @xmath127 , is necessary to resolve the cluster core reliably .",
    "then it makes sense to incorporate effects of cooling and heating which have been neglected here mainly because they are not so important with the mass resolutions of our present simulations .",
    "we have considered only one fairly specific cosmological model , and it is interesting to examine the cosmological model dependence of the results . nevertheless we hope that our current results have highlighted several potentially important implications for the future cluster observations in the x  ray , mm , and submm bands .",
    "we thank tetsu kitayama and yi - peng jing for useful discussions and an anonymous referee for several constructive comments .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the use of two publicly available numerical packages , hydra by h.m.p.couchman , p.a.thomas and f.r.pearce , and cosmics by e.bertschinger , for the present simulations .",
    "numerical computations were carried out on vpp300/16r and vx/4r at the astronomical data analysis center of the national astronomical observatory , japan , as well as at resceu ( research center for the early universe , university of tokyo ) and kek ( national laboratory for high energy physics , japan ) .",

    "<S> our simulations indicate that fractional uncertainties of the estimates of @xmath3 amount to @xmath5% mainly due to the departure from the isothermal and spherical gas density distribution . we find a systematic underestimate bias of @xmath3 by @xmath5% for clusters @xmath6 , but not at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the gas temperature drop in the central regions of our simulated clusters leads to the underestimate bias of @xmath4 by @xmath8% at @xmath7 and by @xmath9% at @xmath6 in addition to the statistical errors of the comparable amount due to the non - spherical gas profile .    </S>",
