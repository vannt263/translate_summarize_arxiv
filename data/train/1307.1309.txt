    "radio - emitting jets are common in accreting black - hole binaries . in their hard spectral state ( see ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) , the jet is approximately steady and characterized by a flat , @xmath0 , radio spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this property is well explained by the particle flux of the radio - emitting electrons ( non - thermal with a power - law distribution ) being maintained along the jet together with conservation of magnetic energy flux @xcite .",
    "given the presence of substantial adiabatic and radiative losses , the observation of a flat radio spectrum appears to require a distributed dissipation along the jet .    in accreting binaries with a high - mass donor ( e.g. , cyg x-1 and cyg x-3 ) ,",
    "the jet is also irradiated by a strong flux of blackbody photons from the donor .",
    "the relativistic electrons compton upscatter those photons at a rate proportional to the product of the electron number and the irradiating flux , which is approximately constant per unit length up to the height of the order of the binary separation .",
    "observationally , hard state jets extend , on one hand , to radii much above the binary separation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the radio - emitting relativistic electrons are present in the jet at least down to the height of the order of the binary separation , as implied by the strong orbital modulation of the radio emission in the case of cyg x-1 @xcite .",
    "thus , hard - state jets ( unless they are highly relativistic ) can effectively emit compton upscattered blackbody radiation ( hereafter bbc ) over very long lengths .",
    "other optically - thin radiative processes , namely synchrotron , synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) , and upscattering of photons emitted by the accretion flow ( hereafter xc ) may dominate the jet emission close to the jet base . furthermore , jet electrons lose energy adiabatically ( appendix [ adiabatic ] ) .    there have been a large number of models proposed to account for global emission properties of the jets in agn and black hole binaries .",
    "first , ( i ) the radiating part of a jet is approximated as one - zone , even if the shape of the jet and the dependence of the magnetic field on height are sometimes taken into account , e.g. , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "those models have been applied mostly to blazars .",
    "there have been a very large number of studies in this category , some recent papers are @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "then , another category of models consider jets with extended emission . in one class ( ii ) of such models ,",
    "relativistic electrons are assumed to be accelerated exclusively at the jet base , and then their evolution is studied as they move along the jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , reacceleration appears necessary , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "then , another class ( iii ) of models assumes that the electron distribution is maintained along the jet by some unspecified process ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter zls12 ; @xcite ) . in some of these studies ,",
    "the effect of radiative cooling on the distribution is taken into account by including a cooling break in the electron distribution , at the lorentz factor at which the rates of radiative and adiabatic losses are equal .",
    "the importance of cooling breaks in jets of black - hole binaries was pointed out by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the presence of the cooling break is predicted in jets in which electron acceleration occurs in localized regions , which is the case , e.g. , in the internal shock model ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in many models , however ,",
    "several simplifying assumptions , e.g. , the electron cooling break constant being along the jet , are introduced ( e.g. , zls12 ) .",
    "yet another class ( iv ) of models assumes the rate of electron acceleration as a function of the height and lorentz factor , and solves for the electron steady state distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly to the models ( ii ) , the equation governing that evolution includes radiative cooling together with advection along the jet .",
    "the present work belongs to the class ( iv ) .",
    "different than the above studies ( iv ) , we take into account the bbc and xc cooling and emission .",
    "generally , the rate of radiative losses strongly varies along the jet , and in high - mass binaries , this dependence is further complicated by the presence of the bbc losses .",
    "the relative importance of radiative cooling decreases with the jet height , which effect increases the number of relativistic electrons at high - energies with respect to that in models without a cooling break or with a uniform electron break lorentz factor .",
    "this effect can strongly increase the bbc flux above the mev energies .    here",
    ", we present a jet model addressing the above issues in detail .",
    "we assume the rate of the electron acceleration to be a power - law function of the electron energy , with both low and high - energy cutoffs .",
    "we also anticipate power - law scaling of the dissipation rate and of the magnetic field strength with the jet height . in most of the calculations ,",
    "we make a simplifying assumption that the jet above certain height is conical and has a constant velocity .",
    "we formulate a kinetic equation for the electron distribution at each height taking into account the adiabatic and radiative losses and advection , and a radiative transfer equation taking into account the synchrotron and compton processes . for both electron distribution and emission spectra",
    ", we take into account the effect of synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "we solve the resulting equations self - consistently taking into account the ssc , bbc and xc processes and photon - photon pair absorption of @xmath1-ray photons . in the case of adiabatic , optically - thin synchrotron and thomson losses and advection",
    ", we find the analytical solution to the electron kinetic equation .",
    "we also introduce some approximate analytical solutions in appendices [ thomson][compton_loss ] , and present a method of calculating the opacity to photon - photon pair production in the field of a star in appendix [ taupair ] .",
    "we assume no efficient acceleration of ions , which process would lead to hadronic radiative processes , taken into account by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also neglect bremsstrahlung , which is usually inefficient in jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our model is intended to account for the jet contributions to broad - band spectra of accreting sources , from radio to high and very high energy @xmath1-rays .",
    "radio emission is common in accreting x - ray binaries , but so far the only firm case of high - energy @xmath1-ray emission detected from such systems is that of cyg x-3 , which has been detected by _",
    "fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite and by _ agile _",
    "this emission has been well explained by compton upscattering of the donor blackbody photons by relativistic electrons in a localized region of the jet @xcite .",
    "this appears to be the only proposed explanation of the @xmath1-ray emission that accounts for the observed @xcite strong orbital modulation of the @xmath1-rays .",
    "it demonstrates that compton upscattering of stellar blackbody photons by a jet in a high - mass x - ray binary is an observable process . in the soft state of cyg x-3 ,",
    "electron acceleration in the inner parts of the jet occurs intermittently . on the other hand ,",
    "radio data for high - mass black - hole binaries in hard states reveal persistent acceleration along the entire jet body .",
    "then , not only a detection but also upper limits on the @xmath1-ray emission can constrain relativistic electron spectra in hard - state jets .    the second case of reported high and very high @xmath1-ray emission from an accreting binary",
    "is that of cyg x-1 .",
    "a single short flare of the source has been reported in the tev range @xcite .",
    "recently , upper limits at @xmath2 mev and a tentative detection of a steady 0.110 gev emission component in the hard state of cyg x-1 have been found in the most recent accumulation of the _ fermi _ lat data @xcite .",
    "no emission has been found in the soft state .",
    "the presence of @xmath1-ray emission in the hard - state has been independently confirmed by @xcite , who reported 21 ( low - significance ) detections of cyg x-1 by _ fermi _ lat on a daily time scale . out of those ,",
    "15 were in the hard state , five in an intermediate state , and only one event was in the soft state , in spite of a substantial exposure in that state .",
    "it is then highly unlikely that the hard / intermediate state detections were statistical fluctuations .",
    "this confirms the results of @xcite .",
    ".the main symbols used in this work . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ symbols ]    zls12 have developed a global jet emission model applied to cyg x-1 . here , we extend this work by considering additional effects and processes , listed below : ( i ) compton upscattering of stellar photons ( bbc ) by the jet .",
    "as discussed in section [ intro ] , upscattering of blackbody photons is important in high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "( ii ) compton upscattering of accretion - flow photons ( xc ) .",
    "only some general energetic constraints were given in zls12 for these two effects .",
    "( iii ) the dependence of the shape of the electron distribution on the height along the jet , @xmath3 , which was neglected in zls12 .",
    "also , the ssc process was considered by zls12 in a one - zone approximation only .",
    "( iv ) advection of electrons along the jet , which was neglected in zls12 .",
    "the effects ( i  ii ) have been included in jet models of cyg x-1 of @xcite .",
    "the effects ( ii  iv ) may be important in both low and high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "table [ symbols ] lists the main symbols used in this work .",
    "in particular , we define the differential energy flux , @xmath4 , as having the energy unit in @xmath5 the same as the unit of @xmath6 .",
    "as the two energy units cancel each other , the unit of @xmath7 is @xmath8 s@xmath9 .",
    "this convention , adopted hereafter , simplifies substantially all the radiative formulae introduced in the paper .",
    "the integrated energy flux has then the unit of energy ( either erg or kev ) times @xmath8 s@xmath9 .",
    "we express the height along the jet in units of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , where @xmath10 is at the height of the onset of dissipation and emission .",
    "we then specify the coordinate system , which is needed to account for the anisotropy effects in the bbc , xc and pair - absorption processes in binaries .",
    "we assume the jet and counterjet are perpendicular to the binary plane , i.e. , along the @xmath3 axis , the orbit to be circular , the superior conjunction ( compact object behind the star ) corresponds to the orbital phase (= polar angle ) of @xmath12 , and the @xmath13 axis points away from the star to the direction of the compact object at the superior conjunction .",
    "then , the unit vectors pointing towards the observer , from the stellar centre to the compact object , along the jet and counterjet , from the stellar centre to the emission location along the jet at the height @xmath14 , and from a point on the accretion disc distant from the centre by @xmath15 and with the azimuth @xmath16 are , respectively , @xmath17^{1/2},\\nonumber}\\\\ \\lefteqn{r_{\\rm dj}=\\left[r_{\\rm d}^2+(\\xi z_{\\rm m})^2\\right]^{1/2},\\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath18 and @xmath19 sign is for the jet and counterjet , respectively , and @xmath20 is the distance from the stellar centre to the emission location .",
    "we define a dimensionless photon energy in the jet / counterjet frame and the jet and counterjet doppler factors ( for perpendicular jets ) , @xmath21 where @xmath6 is the observed dimensional photon energy , the @xmath19 and @xmath18 sign is for the jet and counterjet , respectively , @xmath22 is the jet bulk velocity , and @xmath23 is the corresponding lorentz factor .",
    "we assume the entire jet motion is along its axis , which is a sufficient approximation for narrow jets .",
    "we also define a doppler factor of the stellar radiation ( at @xmath24 ) seen in the jet frame ( at @xmath25 ) , @xmath26^{1/2}\\right\\}},\\quad \\epsilon_0={e_0\\over { \\cal d}_*(\\xi ) m_{\\rm e } c^2 } , \\label{dstar}\\ ] ] which @xmath27 approximates the star as a point source , and is the same for the jet and counterjet in the perpendicular case assumed here .",
    "analogously , the jet - frame doppler factor of emission from a point distant by @xmath15 from the jet axis on the plane at @xmath28 ( e.g. , of an accretion disc ) is , @xmath29^{1/2}\\right\\ } } .",
    "\\label{dx}\\ ] ] the relationship between photon energy in the jet frame to that in the system frame is the same as above .",
    "we consider jets of an arbitrary shape , given by the dependence of the radius on height , @xmath30 , the magnetic field dependence , @xmath31 , the normalization of the dissipation rate per unit volume , @xmath32 , and the velocity , @xmath33 .",
    "however , we analyze in detail only conical jets with conserved magnetic energy flux and the dissipation rate ( at a given @xmath1 ) constant per @xmath34 , and constant velocity , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the opening angle , @xmath37 is the field strength at the jet base , and @xmath38 is a constant ( see below ) .",
    "we assume continuous energy dissipation along the jet .",
    "we also assume that the outflow is composed of two types of regions , one characterized by efficient dissipation of the jet energy and conversion of it into electron acceleration , and the other dominated by electron energy loss processes ( as , e.g. , in the model of @xcite ) . in the former regions , which we assume to occupy only a small part of the jet , electrons undergo a diffusive acceleration / escape process limited solely by radiative losses .",
    "we discuss possible forms of the acceleration .",
    "then we consider in detail the emission regions , taking into account injection of the accelerated electrons , electron energy losses and advection of electrons along the jet .",
    "the jet is launched at some height , @xmath39 , and it is then accelerated .",
    "the dissipation is assumed to begin at some height @xmath40 , and to end at @xmath41 . above @xmath42 ,",
    "the jet continues to propagate , and we follow the electron evolution until the electrons lose all their energies .",
    "@xcite for @xmath43 and 2.2 ( red and blue solid curves , respectively ) and @xmath44 , compared with the corresponding e - folded power - law distributions ( dashed curves ) .",
    "we see that the e - folded power laws strongly underestimate the actual rates around the cutoff .",
    "the normalization is to unity at @xmath45 . ]",
    "physical mechanisms resulting in the efficient electron acceleration within relativistic outflows are still hardly known , being subjected to the ongoing debate .",
    "it could be diffusive shock acceleration ( e.g. , @xcite ) , stochastic acceleration by turbulent magnetic field ( e.g. , @xcite ) or direct electron energization within magnetic reconnection sites ( e.g. , @xcite ) . given this lack of knowledge , we assume the distribution of accelerated electrons forms a power law , @xmath46 , between low and high - energy cutoffs , and we take @xmath47 to be a free parameter .",
    "we note that the non - thermal tails in the particle spectra formed due to diffusive shock acceleration in the case of relativistic outflows are expected to be approximately of a power - law form , with the energy index @xmath48 depending on the shock velocity , magnetic field orientation ( with respect to the shock normal ) , and the turbulence conditions in the vicinity of a shock ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the high - energy cutoff of the distribution , @xmath49 , is , most likely , related to the acceleration rate balanced by radiative losses within the acceleration region .",
    "the acceleration rate in the high - efficiency limit can be parameterized as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the electron mass and charge , respectively , and @xmath53 is an efficiency factor , which has to be @xmath54 unless the electric field is @xmath55 .",
    "we then balance this rate by that of synchrotron losses ( though we check the effect of inclusion of other losses ) .",
    "this gives @xmath49 and the corresponding cutoff synchrotron photon energy , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath58 is the critical magnetic field , see table [ symbols ] , and @xmath59 is the planck constant .",
    "we note @xmath60 is independent of @xmath61 @xcite . for conserved magnetic energy flux in a conical jet , equation ( [ conical ] ) , @xmath62 .",
    "we note several caveats to the above relatively standard assumption .",
    "electric field @xmath55 seems to occur occasionally in the crab nebula , and thus @xmath53 can be @xmath63 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the rate of the diffusive ( and , in particular , the diffusive shock ) acceleration is limited by the larmor period , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the larmor radius , which constraint corresponds to @xmath66 .",
    "( this factor of @xmath67 was included in the definition of @xmath53 in zls12 . ) then , the larmor radius has to be less than the size of a single acceleration region , @xmath68 , which imposes an independent constraint of @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , the acceleration process can be purely stochastic in nature , with the acceleration rate depending on the scale distribution of the turbulence energy density , usually parameterized by its power - law index , @xmath71 . in the bohm limit of @xmath72 , @xmath49",
    "is given approximately by equation ( [ gemax ] ) , but the steady - state spectrum of the accelerated particles is expected to be flat , with @xmath73 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , a range of @xmath74 can be obtained in the hard - sphere limit of @xmath75 @xcite , but then the acceleration time scale is approximately constant , which implies @xmath76 ( though still limited by the overall maximum of equation [ gemax ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath77 .",
    "finally , we note that the values of @xmath61 in the acceleration and energy loss regions can be different .",
    "since we do not know which acceleration process operates in jets , we can not uniquely specify the shape of the high - energy cutoff in the acceleration rate .",
    "for example , in the stochastic case with @xmath75 , it is given by equation ( 8) in @xcite .",
    "[ acc ] shows a comparison of that solution to an e - folded power law for two values of @xmath47 .",
    "we see e - folded spectrum strongly underestimates the solution .",
    "thus , we introduce a symbolic function , @xmath78 , to denote the cutoff in the spectrum of the accelerated particles .",
    "however , since we use here a @xmath79-function approximation to the synchrotron emissivity , finding the accurate form of the electron cutoff is out of scope of this paper .    at low energies",
    ", we also expect a cutoff at @xmath80 , likely at @xmath81 .",
    "e.g. , a quasi - maxwellian electron distribution with @xmath82 has been found in particle - in - cell simulations of collisionless shocks @xcite . in those simulations , an approximate energy equipartition between quasi - thermal electrons and ions",
    "is often observed , namely @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the average lorentz factor of the ions and @xmath85 is the ion mass .",
    "acceleration then proceeds only from this distribution . here , we approximate this situation by a sharp low - energy cutoff at @xmath86 .",
    "this differs , e.g. , from the approach of @xcite , who assumed a hard injection below @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the form of the electron acceleration we use is @xmath88 when @xmath89 , equation ( [ conical ] ) , we have a constant injected power per unit @xmath1 per unit logarithmic interval of the height of a conical jet .",
    "together with the conserved magnetic energy flux , this leads to the spectral index @xmath90 in the partially self - absorbed segment of the synchrotron spectrum independently of the value of the electron power - law index , @xmath47 @xcite , which is approximately satisfied in the hard state of black - hole binaries , in particular in cyg x-1 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite assumed @xmath91 const , which corresponds to the power per unit @xmath92 being @xmath93 , i.e. , most of it injected around @xmath42 , which appears to us rather unlikely .",
    "we note that the condition of @xmath94 is somewhat different from the corresponding condition for the integrated power per @xmath95 , @xmath96 , especially for @xmath97 due to the dependence of @xmath62 in conical jets with conserved magnetic energy flux , implying the integrated power is @xmath98 . in this case , it is possible that @xmath49 is limited not by synchrotron losses but by the available injected power , and thus @xmath49 could be constant with @xmath99 . however , given theoretical uncertainties about the dissipation rate and the acceleration mechanism , we keep below the relation of equation ( [ gemax ] ) . for @xmath100 ,",
    "the leading dependence is on @xmath87 , which is likely to be constant with height . in that case ,",
    "the dependencies of @xmath101 and @xmath102 on @xmath99 are almost the same .",
    "the electron energy loss rate , @xmath103 , in an expanding jet irradiated by a companion star and an accretion flow has in general five components .",
    "these are due to the adiabatic , synchrotron , bbc , ssc and xc processes , with the corresponding rates denoted below by @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "the adiabatic loss rate ( see also appendix [ adiabatic ] ) is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is time in the comoving frame . in a conical jet , @xmath111    the synchrotron loss rate",
    "can be written as @xmath112\\over \\tau_\\perp(\\gamma,\\xi ) } , \\label{gdot_syn}}\\\\ \\lefteqn { \\tau_\\perp(\\gamma,\\xi)\\equiv \\alpha_{\\rm s}(\\gamma,\\xi)z_{\\rm m}\\xi\\tan\\theta_{\\rm j } ,   \\label{tau_syn}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 is the radial ( perpendicular to the jet axis ) self - absorption optical depth , the absorption coefficient , @xmath114 , is given by equation ( [ alphas ] ) below , and we relate the synchrotron @xmath115 and @xmath1 by the delta - function approximation , @xmath116 .",
    "the term involving @xmath113 follows from the equation of radiative transfer and the relation between @xmath117 and the corresponding emissivity .",
    "the optical depth here should have been averaged over the jet cross section and all directions , but here we use @xmath118 for simplicity . the second term above can also be approximated in a simpler form as @xmath119 . for @xmath120 , equation ( [ conical ] ) ,",
    "we therefore rewrite the synchrotron energy loss rate as @xmath121 } , \\quad a_{\\rm s}\\equiv{\\sigma_{\\rm t } b_0 ^ 2\\over 6\\upi m_{\\rm e } c}. \\label{gdot_syn0}\\ ] ]    the loss rate due to compton scattering of stellar blackbody photons is @xmath122 ^ 2,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is the klein - nishina ( kn ) correction factor ( @xmath124 in the thomson limit ) , and @xmath125 is the thomson cross section .",
    "this formulation of bbc losses uses @xmath103 averaged over all the directions of electrons , assuming the efficient particle isotropization ( note that the electrons moving towards the star lose the energy faster than the ones moving in the opposite direction ) .",
    "we note here that @xmath126 , rather than being a constant , includes the dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath99 .",
    "however , this dependence is monotonic , and weak as long as @xmath127 is not close to 1 , @xmath128 thus , it does not affect dominant functional dependence of @xmath129 .",
    "also , @xmath126 includes the factor @xmath123 , which depends on @xmath99 and @xmath1 outside the thomson regime .",

    "we calculate the effect of pair absorption exactly , integrating the attenuated bbc emission over both the height and phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the ssc and xc fluxes are independent of the orbital phase .",
    "then , the ssc emission for @xmath392 and the xc radiation are emitted mostly at @xmath393 , and thus it can be calculated at the jet base , neglecting the dependence of @xmath394 .",
    "we note that the absorbed @xmath1-rays will produce pairs , which , in turn , may compton upscatter the stellar radiation , thus initiating a spatially - extended pair cascade , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite",
    ". this will give rise to emission at energies lower than those of the absorbed @xmath1-rays .",
    "however , for magnetic fields expected around a supergiant , the pairs may predominantly emit synchrotron ( rather than compton ) emission @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron emission of the pairs is then negligible compared to other emission of the system .",
    "we neglect this effect in our treatment of pair absorption .",
    "we have provided a set of equations allowing us to calculate emission of an extended jet with specified shape , magnetic field strength vs.  height , and the rate of acceleration of relativistic electrons as a function of the lorentz factor and height .",
    "some of our results are general , but most follow the assumptions given in equation ( [ conical ] ) , i.e. , the jet is conical , has a constant speed , the magnetic energy flux is conserved , and the power injected per unit logarithmic height is constant .",
    "also , following equation ( [ q_inj ] ) , the electrons are accelerated with a power - law distribution above some minimum lorentz factor and with a high - energy cutoff given by the balance of acceleration and synchrotron losses , equation ( [ gemax ] ) .",
    "if we accept those assumptions , we can choose the parameters based on observational ( e.g. , radio maps , studies of binary parameters ) and theoretical arguments : @xmath36 , @xmath127 , @xmath42 , @xmath395 and @xmath396 .",
    "the six free parameters of a model are then @xmath53 , @xmath38 , @xmath47 , @xmath10 , @xmath37 , and @xmath87 , which can be fitted to an observed spectrum . a value of @xmath87 can be chosen within some limits on the basis of theoretical considerations , see section [ acceleration ] .",
    "if we have a broad - band spectrum of a jet , we can find the best fit of the parameters , and see how well the model describes the data .",
    "on the other hand , we need a minimum of five observables to determine the remaining five free parameters . as an example",
    ", we can take them as the flux in the self - absorbed part of the synchrotron spectrum , @xmath397 , the turnover energy , @xmath342 , the energy of the high - energy cutoff in the optically - thin synchrotron spectrum , @xmath398 , an optically - thin synchrotron flux , @xmath399 , and the flux at a @xmath1-ray high energy , @xmath400 .",
    "the solution can then be obtained using the following main relations .",
    "1 .   equation ( [ gemax ] ) , which relates @xmath53 to @xmath398 ; 2 .",
    "equation ( [ eturn ] ) at @xmath342 , requiring @xmath401 ; 3 .",
    "equation ( [ thin_thick ] ) for the synchrotron flux at @xmath402 , requiring it equals @xmath403 ; 4 .   equation ( [ jet_f ] ) for the flux at @xmath404 , requiring it equals @xmath405 ; 5 .   equations ( [ synsc][compton_aniso ] ) at @xmath406 , requiring the sum of the bbc , ssc and xc fluxes averaged over the orbital phase and photon - photon pair - absorbed equals @xmath407 .",
    "we can solve these equations simultaneously or by iteration .",
    "generally , the relation ( i ) yields @xmath53 , ( ii ) gives an estimate of @xmath38 , ( iii ) relates @xmath37 to @xmath10 , ( iv ) @xmath405 strongly depends on @xmath47 , and ( v ) @xmath407 is strongly anti - correlated with @xmath37 . in the absence of one of the observables",
    ", we can assume some form of equipartition , either @xmath408 or @xmath409 .",
    "we can either use the exact formalism including electron advection , section [ kinetic ] , or approximate @xmath362 by its local form , equation ( [ n_cool ] ) .",
    "if we have a solution , we can calculate its implied values of the equipartition parameters , @xmath283 and @xmath294 .",
    "these parameters define three regimes : ( i ) @xmath410 , electron pressure dominates over that of the magnetic field , ( ii ) @xmath411 and @xmath412 , magnetic pressure dominates over that of the electrons but is not important for the jet dynamics , and ( iii ) @xmath413 , the magnetic field dominates the dynamics .",
    "any efficient diffusive shock acceleration is expected to take place in the weak - magnetization regime , @xmath414 .",
    "given the components of the jet power , section [ eq_power ] , we check their physical self - consistency .",
    "for example , our assumption of a constant jet speed requires that the power injected in relativistic electrons , @xmath415 ( approximately equal to the total radiated power ) , is @xmath416 the jet power in particles and magnetic field , @xmath417 .",
    "the radiated power can be at the expense of the power in ions , and can be dissipated by shock acceleration , or at the expense of the magnetic field , dissipated by reconnection .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "we have formulated a detailed model of a jet emitting in an extended height range , taking into account continuous electron acceleration along the outflow .",
    "extended jets with distributed energy dissipation are likely to be present in the hard spectral state of black - hole binaries .",
    "the synchrotron spectra from various heights are partially self - absorbed , and the superposition of them yields a radio spectrum with @xmath418 .    assuming power - law scaling of the electron acceleration rate , we derive the steady - state electron distribution along the jet , taking into account acceleration , adiabatic , synchrotron and compton energy losses and advection . in the case of compton losses being in the thomson limit",
    ", we find the solution with advection in a form of a single integral , and we find an analytical solution for the radiative losses dominated by optically - thin synchrotron . for our general solution , we take into account the compton losses with the klein - nishina cross section and blackbody , synchrotron and accretion - flow seed photons .",
    "we then derive self - consistently formulae for the photon spectra emitted locally by given steady - state electron distributions .",
    "the synchrotron spectra are calculated from the equation of radiative transfer , which gives the results valid from the self - absorbed to optically thin regimes .",
    "the condition of @xmath419 together with the condition of emitting the flux as observed at the turnover energy relates the height and the magnetic field strength at the place of the onset of the jet emission .",
    "compton scattering in jets is usually in the optically - thin regime , i.e. , only single scattering is important .",
    "compton spectra are derived for blackbody , synchrotron and accretion - flow seed photons . at high energies ,",
    "the locally emitted spectra are attenuated by photon - photon pair production on stellar photons , taking into account the finite extent of the star .",
    "we then integrate the spectra over the jet height .",
    "both compton scattering on stellar photons and pair absorption depend on the orbital phase . to derive the orbit - average flux ,",
    "the spectra need to be integrated over the phase .",
    "compton scattering of stellar blackbody photons by jets in the hard state of black - hole binaries with a high - mass companion was found to be important by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "those jets are extended , and all the electrons in the jet at least up to the height of the order of the binary separation can efficiently up - scatter stellar blackbody photons .",
    "this situation is different from that for synchrotron seed photons , which emission is often dominated by the jet base .",
    "thus , the flux from compton upscattering of stellar photons can be quite high , and is likely to dominate the ssc flux . for standard estimates of the jet magnetic field and acceleration limited by radiative losses ,",
    "this process is predicted to give substantial flux above the mev range .",
    "we also find that klein - nishina effects substantially modify the electron distribution .",
    "we also present details of the treatment of @xcite of the optical depth due to photon - photon pair production in the field of a star , taking into account its finite extent .",
    "this calculation allows us to express it as a triple integral , compared to a quadruple one previously calculated .",
    "the formalism developed in this work is applied to the hard state of cyg x-1 in @xcite .",
    "we present there detailed spectra , electron distributions and cooling rates as functions of the jet height and the spectra integrated over the jet .",

    "the presence of an external medium is often claimed to be required for adiabatic energy losses of an expanding plasma to occur .",

    "the energy lost adiabatically increases the flow bulk motion , or , in an inflow , the adiabatic heating is at the cost of the bulk motion .",
    "microscopically , when isotropically moving particles migrate into a larger volume , a part of their random velocities change into directed ones along the outflow .    in the framework of the model considered here ,",
    "the jet energy flux consists predominantly of the electron internal energy , equation ( [ pe ] ) , and of the bulk motion dominated by ions , equation ( [ pp ] ) . neglecting for simplicity radiative losses and the dynamic part of magnetic field ,",
    "the sum of these two terms is conserved . when the electrons move up , increasing the volume per electron , their isotropic part of the energy decreases , equation ( [ gdot_ad ] ) , and they gain a velocity component along the jet .",

    "this yields @xmath449 at photon energies satisfying @xmath450 , the contribution of the upper boundary of the upper region is negligible .",
    "then , due to @xmath219 changing with height , the spectral steepening of the synchrotron spectrum due to radiative cooling is from @xmath451 to @xmath452 at @xmath453 , and the usual one from @xmath451 to @xmath454 occurs only for @xmath455 .",

    "the maximum lorentz factor of the accelerated electrons , @xmath49 , is only weakly affected by compton scattering of blackbody photons .",
