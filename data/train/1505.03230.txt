    "multiscale is one of the most important features commonly existing in complex systems , where a large range of spatial / temporal scales coexist and interact with each other .",
    "typically such interaction generates scaling relations in the respective scale ranges . to understand",
    "the multiscale statistical behavior has been remaining as the research focus in various areas , such as fluid turbulence  @xcite , financial market analysis @xcite , environmental science  @xcite and population dynamics @xcite , to list a few . among a number of existing analysis approaches for such problems ,",
    "the standard and most cited one is structure - function ( sf ) , which is first introduced by kolmogorov in his famous homogeneous and isotropic turbulence theory in 1941  @xcite .",
    "however , the average operation in sf mixes regions with different correlations  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , sf acts as a filter with a weight function of @xmath0 , in which @xmath1 is the wavenumber and @xmath2 is the separation scale @xcite .",
    "it thus makes the statistics at different scale @xmath2 strongly mixed , resulting in the so - called infrared and ultraviolet effects , respectively for large - scale and small - scale contamination  @xcite .",
    "the situation will be more serious when an energetic structure presents , e.g. , annual cycle in collected geoscience data @xcite , large - scale circulations in rayleigh - bnard convection , vortex trapping events in lagrangian turbulence @xcite .",
    "fourier analysis in the frequency domain has the similar deficiency as sf , i.e. any local event will propagate the influence over the entire analyzed domain , especially for the nonlinear and nonstationary turbulent structures  @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed that a localized expansion should be preferred over unbounded trigonometric functions used in fourier analysis , because it is believed that trigonometric functions are at risk of misinterpreting the characters of field phenomena .",
    "an alternative approach , namely wavelet transform is then proposed to overcome the possible shortcoming of the fourier transform with local capability  @xcite .    to overcome the potential weaknesses of sf or fourier analysis ,",
    "several methodologies have been proposed in recent years to emphasize the local geometrical features , such as detrended fluctuation analysis @xcite , detrended structure - function @xcite , scaling of maximum probability density function of increments @xcite , and hilbert spectral analysis @xcite , to name a few .",
    "note that different approaches may have different performances , and their own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "for example , the detrended structure - function can constrain the influence of the large - scale structure , using the detrending procedure to remove the scales larger than the separation distance @xmath2 . in practice , the famous @xmath3-law",
    "can then be more clearly retrieved than the classical sf @xcite .",
    "however , this method is still biased with the vortex trapping event in lagrangian turbulence , which typically possesses a time scale around @xmath4 in the dissipative range @xcite .",
    "the scaling of maximum probability density function of increments helps to quantify the background fluctuation of turbulent fields .",
    "compared with sf , it can efficiently extract the first - order scaling relations @xcite ; however , it is difficult to extend to higher @xmath5th - order cases .",
    "a new view on the field structure is based on the topological features of the extremal points . in principle",
    ", physical systems may assume different complexity and interpretability in different spaces , such as physical or fourier  @xcite .",
    "the extremal point structure in physical space has the straightforward advantage in defining characteristic parameters .",
    "considering a fluctuating quantity , turbulence disturbs the flow field to generate the local extrema , while viscous diffusion will smooth the field to annihilate the extremal points . by nature",
    "the statistics of local extremal points inherits the process physics .",
    "based on this idea , wang , peters and other collaborators have studied passive scalar turbulence via dissipation element analysis  @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the lagrangian velocity by defining the trajectory segment structure from the extrema of particles local acceleration .",
    "such diagnosis verifies successfully the kolmogorov scaling relation , which has been argued controversially for a long time @xcite .",
    "however , under some circumstances the extremal points may largely be contaminated by noise , thus partly be spurious . in other words",
    "extremal points are sensitive to noise perturbation .",
    "although data smoothing can relieve this problem , some artificial arbitrariness will inevitably be introduced ; moreover it may not be easy to design reliable smoothing algorithms from case to case . in this regard",
    "the extrema - based analyses are not generally applicable , e.g. with noises from measurement inaccuracy , interpolation error or external perturbations .    in this paper",
    "a new method , multi - level segment analysis ( msa ) , has been developed .",
    "the key idea hereof is based on the observation that local extrema are conditionally valid , indicating a kind of multi - level structure .",
    "compared with the aforementioned extrema - based analyses , this new method is a reasonable extension with more applicability .",
    "details in algorithm definition , verification and applications will be introduced in the following .",
    "considering any function @xmath6 in some physical process , where @xmath7 is the independent variable , e.g. , the spatial or temporal coordinates , @xmath8 is a local extremal point with respect to scale @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 ( minimum ) , or @xmath11 ( maximum ) .",
    "extrema are conditionally valid . for instance , if @xmath8 is extremal at scale @xmath9 , it may not be extremal at a larger scale @xmath12 . figure  [ level ] illustrates that for an artificially generated signal , at different @xmath9 levels both the number density and the fluctuation amplitude of the extremal points will change accordingly . under some special conditions",
    "extremal points have simple but interesting properties .",
    "for instance , for a monotonous function , there is no extrema for any @xmath9 ; for a single harmonic wave function with a period of @xmath13 , the number of extremal point remains constant . for real complex multiscale systems as turbulence , variation of extremal point is continuously dependant on @xmath9 .",
    "levels : a ) @xmath14 , and b ) @xmath15 .",
    "the local maxima and minima are demonstrated respectively by @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the vertical line indicates the window size @xmath9 . ]    at a specific @xmath9 level , denote the corresponding extremal point set as @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( along the coordinate increasing direction ) .",
    "numerical tests show that typically these points are @xmath20 alternated for small @xmath9 , while when @xmath9 increases @xmath21 or @xmath22 events may also appear but with low probability ( e.g. , @xmath23 ) , depending on the @xmath6 structure and the process physics .",
    "the segment is defined as the part of @xmath6 between two adjacent extremal points .",
    "the characteristic parameters to describe the structure skeleton are the function difference , i.e. , @xmath24 and the length scale , i.e. , @xmath25 . by varying the @xmath9 value , different extremal point sets , and thus different segment sets ,",
    "can be obtained . in this sense",
    "this procedure is named as multi - level segment analysis ( msa ) ; while the existing approaches based on local extremal points  @xcite calculate extrema from the dns data ; thus can be understood as single - level . compared with the conventional sf , in msa",
    "the segment length scale is not an independent input , but determined by @xmath6 .    .",
    "in terms of structure function , the mathematical expression is ( for the @xmath5th order case ) @xmath26^{q}\\vert { x_{s , i}-x_{s , i-1}=\\ell}\\rangle_{s } , \\label{newsf}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 denotes sampling over different @xmath9 . if any scaling relation exists , one may expect a power - law behavior as @xmath28 in which @xmath29 is the msa scaling exponent .",
    "as shown in the rest of this paper , for simple cases , msa and the classic methods show pretty identical results ; while for complex analyses as turbulence , because of the algorithmic principle to depict the function structure , the former one is more effective and efficient .",
    "some additional comments are stated as follows .",
    "first , msa can be considered as a dynamic - based approach without any basis assumption _ a priori_. since local extrema imply the change of the sign of @xmath30 across @xmath18 . assuming that @xmath6 represents a velocity signal , @xmath30 is then the acceleration , i.e. a dynamical variable .",
    "second , msa shares the spirit of the wavelet - transform - modulus - maxima ( wtmm ) @xcite , in which only the maximum modulus of the wavelet coefficient is considered . however , as argued in several refs.@xcite , if the shape of the chosen mother wavelet is different with the specific turbulent structure , e.g. , ramp - cliff in the passive scalar field , .",
    "in this aspect msa can be considered as a data - driven type of wtmm without any transform .",
