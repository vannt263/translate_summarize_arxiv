    ". this sign can be obtained from the number of negative real eigenmodes @xcite .",
    "the computation of the reweighting for one - flavor qcd and @xmath0 super yang - mills theory was the main purpose of our investigations of the spectrum of @xmath1 .    on small lattices ,",

    "[ fig : completespec1 ] shows that the spectrum of @xmath1 contains large regions with a high eigenvalue density and a nonzero imaginary part . for an efficient calculation of the real eigenvalues , it is crucial to exclude these regions and focus the computation on the eigenvalues in @xmath17 .",

    "it calculates the eigenvalues in the region @xmath19}>{x^{(d_w)}_\\text{ar}}\\}$ ] , where @xmath20 depends on the parameters of the algorithm and the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath1 .",
    "hence , a direct computation does not focus efficiently enough on @xmath17 since a lot of unwanted eigenvalues are calculated .",

    "based on these observations , we propose here the `` peeling transformation '' as an iteration of the power transformation .",
