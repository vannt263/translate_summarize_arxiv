    "the study of galactic models and parameters have long history .",
    "@xcite fitted observations to two - component galactic model , namely disc and halo , while @xcite successfully fit their observations to a galactic model introducing a third component , i.e. the thick disc .",
    "it should be noted that the third component was a rediscovery of the  intermediate population ii \" first described in the vatican proceedings review of @xcite . due to their importance , galactic models have been primary concern and research topic for many research centers : as they can be used as a tool in order to understand the formation and evolution of the galaxy .",
    "different research groups have been using different methods to determine galactic model parameters ( table 1 ) .",
    "for example , @xcite and give 6.5 - 13 and 6 - 10 per cent , respectively , for the relative local space density of the thick disc . however , we think that an appropriate procedure would lead us to expect a smaller range and/or a unique value with a small error .    in the previous studies @xcite we estimated galactic model parameters for stars of different galactic populations and absolute magnitude intervals and we found that the range of these models are rather small relative to the ones appeared in the literature .",
    "it gives the indication that this procedure refines the galactic model parameters .",
    "however such a result may not be considered in the model estimation due to the contamination introduced by the other populations . in the present study we estimated the galactic model parameters only for the thin disc and our previous results",
    "are confirmed .",
    "also , we showed ( section 5.1 ) that the contamination of the thick disc is rather small .",
    "additionally we discussed the dependence of the galactic model parameters on the galactic longitude .",
    "for this , we used the homogeneous @xmath0 data for stars in six intermediate galactic latitude fields in the first galactic quadrant .",
    "the range of the latitudes of the fields is comparatively small , @xmath13 , whereas the longitudes of the fields lie between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "hence , any significant difference between the values of a given galactic model parameters derived for stars in the same absolute magnitude interval for two fields could be attributed to the effect of the galactic longitude , under the condition that our data are not contaminated by other populations , i.e. thick disc .",
    "the sample stars are at distances less than @xmath16 kpc relative to the sun , and as stated above , the thick disc contamination is rather small .",
    "thus , we can say that galactic model parameters are longitude dependent , at least for the six fields investigated in the present study .    in section 2",
    "we describe the data and reductions , in section 3 we introduce the density laws adopted in the present study .",
    "section 4 provides the absolute magnitude determination , and the evaluation of the density functions for thin disc of six fields . in section 5",
    "we estimate the galactic model parameters , and the final conclusion is presented in section 6 .",
    "the data were taken from @xmath0 , data release 3 ( dr3 ) , on the web of six fields with intermediate galactic latitude ( @xmath13 ) in the first galactic quadrant ( table 2 ) .",
    "@xmath0 magnitudes @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 were used for totally 113 380 stars in six fields equal in size ( 10 deg@xmath6 ) except field f6 ( 20 deg@xmath6 ) , down to the limiting magnitude of @xmath22 .",
    "the mean @xmath23 colour excess for each field is less than 0.06 except for the field f1 , @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath23 colour excesses were individually evaluated for each sample source making use of the maps of @xcite through @xmath0 query server and this was reduced to total absorption @xmath25 via equation ( 1 ) .",
    "@xmath26    in order to determine total absorptions , @xmath27 , for the @xmath0 bands , we used @xmath28 data given by @xcite , i.e. 1.593 , 1.199 , 0.858 , 0.639 and 0.459 for @xmath29=@xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "thus , the de - reddened magnitudes , with subscript 0 , are    @xmath30    all the colours and magnitudes mentioned hereafter will be de - reddened ones .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the distribution of stars in the apparent magnitude - colour diagram , @xmath31 , can be classified as follows .",
    "the blue stars in the range @xmath32 are dominated by thick - disc stars with turn - off at @xmath33 , and for @xmath34 the galactic halo stars , with turn - off at @xmath35 , become significant .",
    "red stars , @xmath36 , are dominated by thin disc stars at all apparent magnitudes .",
    "however , the apparent magnitude  colour diagram and the three two - colour diagrams for all objects ( due shortage of space large amount of data not presented here ) indicate that the stellar distributions are contaminated by extragalactic objects as claimed by @xcite .",
    "distinction between star / galaxy was obtained using command probpsf@xmath37 given in dr3 web page . there 1 or 0 is designated for the probability of object being a star or galaxy .",
    "needless to say , separation of 1 or 0 strongly depends on seeing and sky brightness .",
    "apart from the above mentioned work , simulations of @xcite were carefully adopted in order to remove the extragalactic objects in our field .",
    "this is similar to the procedure of @xcite who defined locus points and drew several isodensity contours in the @xmath38-@xmath39 two colour diagrams and rejected stars on the contours at distances larger than 0.3 mag relative to the corresponding locus ( fig .",
    "the colour - magnitude diagram @xmath40-@xmath3 for the final sample ( stars ) are given in fig .",
    "2 . the limiting magnitude for the survey stars in fig .",
    "2 can be read off as @xmath41 . however , the colour and magnitude errors for fainter magnitudes are larger , i.e. ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) for @xmath22 , and ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) for @xmath41 hence we adopted @xmath22 as the limiting magnitude in our work for the evaluation of more reliable galactic model parameters .",
    "disc structures are usually parametrized in cylindrical coordinates by radial and vertical exponentials , @xmath50 where @xmath21 is the distance from the galactic plane , @xmath51 is the planar distance from the galactic centre , @xmath52 is the solar distance from the galactic centre ( 8.6 kpc , @xcite ) , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the scaleheight and scalelength , respectively , and @xmath55 is the normalized density at the solar radius .",
    "the suffix @xmath20 takes the values 1 and 2 as long as the thin and thick discs are considered .",
    "a similar form uses the sech@xmath6 or sech function to parameterize the vertical distribution of the thin disc . as",
    "the secans hyperbolicus is the sum of the two exponentials , the scaleheight corresponding to the sech@xmath6 and sech has to be multiplied by 1.08504 and 1.65745 , respectively ( see appendix a and @xcite ) , for its reduction to the equivalent exponential appendix .    here , we compare the density laws and the derived densities only for the thin disc .",
    "hence , only the corresponding laws and parameters are considered .",
    "contrary to the thick disc and halo stars which overlap in the apparent magnitude  colour diagram , the position of the late - type thin disc stars is very conspicuous in the diagram .",
    "in fact , the @xmath38 histogram for all stars in six fields show a bimodal distribution , one at @xmath56 and another one at @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "the gaussian fit shows that @xmath58 can be adopted as the border separating the late - type thin disc stars from the thick disc and halo couple .",
    "thus , totally 14 940 stars with @xmath59 included into our programme as thin - disc stars ( details are given in section 5.1 ) .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the programme stars were evaluated using the following calibration @xcite    @xmath60    combination of the absolute magnitude @xmath61 and the apparent magnitude @xmath62 of a star gives its distance @xmath19 relative to the sun , i.e. ,    @xmath63_{0}=5\\log r-5.\\ ] ]    for the six fields , the logarithmic space density functions were evaluated for different absolute magnitude intervals however , only the one for the field f4 is given in table 3 ( due to shortage of space ) , but all of them are shown in fig .",
    "4 as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 ; @xmath66 ; @xmath67 denotes the size of the field ( deg@xmath6 ) in question ; @xmath68 and @xmath69 denote the lower and upper limiting distance of the volume @xmath70 ; @xmath71 is the number of stars ; @xmath72^{1/3}$ ] is the centroid distance of the volume @xmath70 ; and @xmath73 , @xmath74 being the galactic latitude of the field center in question .",
    "the thick horizontal lines in table 3 correspond to the limiting distance of completeness , @xmath75 , which are calculated from the following equations :    @xmath63_{0}=5 \\log r_{l}-5,\\\\\\ ] ]    @xmath76    where @xmath62 is the limiting apparent magnitude ( 16 and 21 , for the bright and faint stars , respectively ) , @xmath77 is the limiting distance of completeness , and @xmath61 is the corresponding absolute magnitude in the interval ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) .",
    "a @xmath80 method was employed to fit the analytical density laws given in section 3 for thin disc to the observation - based space densities with the additional constraint of producing local densities consistent with those derived from hipparcos @xcite .",
    "this procedure was applied in our previous papers ( kbh , bkg ) .",
    "one must be certain that our space density functions should belong to stars of the thin disc before discussing the galactic model parameters , evaluated by the comparison mentioned above .",
    "our strong argument is about the distance of stars relative to the sun : all stars are at distances less that @xmath81 kpc , and most of them at distances shorter than 1.5 kpc ( fig .",
    "25 stars with distances @xmath82 kpc relative to the sun ( table 3 ) are beyond the limiting distance of completeness which are not included into the statistics . however , fitting the observed data to the galactic model for the field f4 , as example , in fig .",
    "5 shows that there is a slight excess in the observational based number of stars in the distances near to the galactic plane @xmath83 kpc .",
    "this means some contamination of the thick disc .",
    "comparison of the observational based data for the field f4 with the galactic model of @xcite for two extreme scaleheights and solar normalizations of the thick disc , i.e. @xmath84 pc ; @xmath85 per cent , and @xmath86 pc ; @xmath87 per cent ( figs . 6 and 7 ) confirms this suggestion .",
    "now , the question is to find out the amount of this contamination .",
    "the locus of stars estimated in our work for absolute magnitude intervals @xmath4 and @xmath5 are below the model curve of thin disc of @xcite . whereas for the intervals @xmath7 and @xmath8 there is an excess in number of stars for the distance intervals @xmath88 pc relative to the model curve thin disc , indicating some contamination of the thick disc in our work .",
    "we reduced the excess number of observed stars in fig .",
    "6 ( figs . 6 and 7 are rather similar ) such as to fit to the predicted ones for the thin disc in the galactic model of @xcite , and we re - estimated the galactic model parameters for the field f4 .",
    "the contamination of the thick disc in number of stars are 7 , 14 , and 16 per cent for the absolute magnitude intervals @xmath4 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the differences between three sets of parameters , for the previous galactic model and the one with re - estimated parameters are as follows : @xmath89 , @xmath90 pc , @xmath91 pc for the absolute magnitude intervals in the order given above .",
    "these small amounts show that the contamination of the thick disc is rather small . the galactic model with the re - estimated parameters mentioned above fit to the observational based data ( fig .",
    "hence our results stated in the following sections can be attributed to as the properties of the thin disc .",
    "it turned out that the exponential law fitted better for the brightest and faintest intervals , i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath5 , whereas sech and sech@xmath92 laws are appropriate for the intermediate intervals , i.e. @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the numerical values for @xmath93 given in table 4 , of the columns 7 and 12 substantiate our suggestion .",
    "the resulting galactic model parameters are summarized in table 4 .",
    "the scaleheights for the sech and sech@xmath6 laws are reduced in accordance with the exponential law by multiplying them with 1.65745 and 1.08504 , respectively .",
    "hence , the symbol @xmath94 in table 4 corresponds to the exponential law .",
    "it is seen that the parameters are absolute magnitude - dependent for six fields .",
    "for example , the scaleheight is shorter for the brightest and faintest intervals with respect to one for the intermediate intervals .",
    "also , the scalelength changes from one absolute magnitude interval to the other , without following any rule or pattern .    here",
    "we present a question : is it possible to claim that the scales substantially change with galactic longitude ?",
    "the answer of this question can be obtained by fitting one disc model to the stars in a given absolute magnitude range for six fields at the same time . fig .",
    "9 compares the derived logarithmic space densities for the absolute magnitude interval @xmath8 for six fields with the thin disc model of @xcite .",
    "the corresponding scaleheight and scalelength of the model are @xmath94=330 pc and @xmath95=2250 pc , respectively . the agreement between the derived data and",
    "the model is rather low .",
    "additionally , the standard deviations are large and the resulting solar space densities for six fields are different than the hipparcos @xcite one for the same absolute magnitude interval ( table 5 ) .",
    "the disagreement mentioned above indicates that the claim related to the scales change with galactic longitude is valid .",
    "all error estimates in table 4 were obtained by changing galactic model parameters until an increase or decrease by 1 in @xmath80 was achieved @xcite .",
    "the parameters were tested against the luminosity function given in table 4 ( last column ) and fig .",
    "10 , where @xmath96 is the local space density for thin disc .",
    "the absence of the local space densities for thick disc and halo , which is limited to @xmath9710 per cent of the total local space density , did not affect the smooth agreement between the luminosity function and the derived from hipparcos data @xcite .",
    "an interesting result can be deduced from table 4 where the dependence of the scaleheight ( @xmath94 ) , and scalelength ( @xmath95 ) , on the galactic longitude ( @xmath98 ) , for each absolute magnitude interval is seen .",
    "in fact , table 6 , fig .",
    "11 and fig .",
    "12 show that @xmath94 and @xmath95 change linearly from one interval to the other i.e. @xmath99 @xmath100 where the coefficients @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( @xmath20=1 , 2 ) are given in table 7 .",
    "the correlation is higher for the scaleheight than for the scalelength and the correlation coefficient for the scaleheight decreases from the bright absolute magnitude intervals to the faint ones , contrary to the one for scalelength .",
    "the correlation coefficient of @xmath94 for the interval @xmath5 is rather small , @xmath103 , and the slope coefficient is negative , i.e. @xmath104 , in contradiction with the others .",
    "the dependence of the scaleheight and scalelength on the galactic longitude has so far not been claimed anywhere in the literature .",
    "hence it is a novelty .",
    "in the present study , we used the homogeneous @xmath0 data for stars in six intermediate galactic latitude fields in the first galactic quadrant and derived galactic model parameters for the thin disc .",
    "star / galaxy separation was performed by utilizing the command probpsf@xmath37 in dr3 web page to provide each object s probability of being a star in each filter .",
    "as the quality of this separation strongly depends on the seeing and sky brightness , we adopted also the simulation of @xcite in order to remove the extragalactic objects from our sample .",
    "this is similar to the procedure of @xcite who define locus points and draw several isodensity contours in the @xmath2 two colour diagram and reject stars on the contours at distances larger than 0.3 mag relative to the corresponding locus .",
    "thin disc stars were separated from the thick disc and halo stars by the bimodal distribution of stars in the @xmath38 histogram .",
    "comparison of the observational based space density functions with the galactic model of @xcite revealed that there is a slight contamination , i.e. 7 , 14 , and 16 per cent for the absolute magnitude intervals @xmath4 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , respectively , of the thick disc which does not affect the resulting galactic model parameters considerably .",
    "thus , we obtained a sample of 14 940 thin disc stars with apparent magnitude @xmath105 and colour indice @xmath59 .",
    "the absolute magnitudes were evaluated according to the new calibration appeared in one of our papers @xcite .",
    "the range of the galactic model parameters estimated for different absolute magnitude intervals , i.e. @xmath4 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath5 , is rather small relative to the ones appeared in the literature .",
    "hence , our previous results ( kbh and bkg ) are confirmed .    as in our previous works , we added the constraint of producing densities at the solar radius consistent with those derived from @xmath106 @xcite , and showed that the exponential density law fits better to the density functions for the brightest and faintest intervals , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , whereas sech and sech@xmath6 are more suitable for intermediate intervals , i.e. @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "thus , we confirmed the work of @xcite who showed that the observational based density functions for thin disc fit to two density laws , sech and exponential .",
    "comparison of the scaleheights and scalelengths of six fields , for the same absolute magnitude intervals , with their longitudes indicate that these parameters are longitude dependent",
    ". however , the correlation for the scalelength is not as high as for the scaleheight one . additionally the errors for the scalelength are larger than the errors for the scaleheight .",
    "alternatively , one may argue that tendency of the scaleheight and scalelength may due to the effect of the thick disc and/or halo stars at different distances from the galactic center at different longitudes . however , as we mentioned above ( section 5.1 ) the contamination of the thick disc is rather small .",
    "hence this argument is out of question in our work .",
    "it is worthwhile to remind that our sample stars in a field are at distances less than @xmath16 kpc relative to the sun , hence their distances from the galactic center do not differ considerably from each other .",
    "one may think that the argument stated in the former paragraph is in contradiction with the double exponential structure of the thin disc . whereas we think in a different way .",
    "we do not reject the double exponential structure of the thin disc .",
    "however , we argue that additional constraints should be added for the refinement of scaleheight and scalelength of the thin disc ( and the thick disc ) .    finally , we compare scaleheights and scalelengths with the ones of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors give larger scaleheights than the mean scaleheight , @xmath107 pc , in our work for fields with larger galactic longitudes , i.e. @xcite : @xmath108 pc , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ; @xcite : @xmath111 pc , @xmath112 ; and @xcite : @xmath113 pc , @xmath114 . according to the relation between the scaleheight and the galactic longitude given in this work we expect larger scaleheights for larger galactic longitudes .",
    "hence , the scaleheights presented in this work are in agreement with those appeared recently .",
    "the difference between our work and the others is that we argue and show the dependence of the scaleheight on the galactic longitude .    the mean scalelength in our work , @xmath115 pc , is close to the ones adopted by @xcite , @xmath116 pc , and @xcite , @xmath117 pc for estimation of the scaleheights in their work .",
    "this work was supported by the research fund of the university of istanbul .",
    "project number : byp 706/07062005 .",

    "the solution of this equation produces @xmath129 .",
    "the standard local space densities of hipparcos @xcite were reduced to the @xmath0 photometry , where the relation between @xmath130 and @xmath131 derived for the main - sequence stars within 10 pc of the sun by @xcite , were used in order to transform @xmath131 absolute magnitudes of the yale parallax catalog @xcite and the hipparcos mission @xcite to the @xmath130 colour indices , i.e.                                                                                              -distances for stars in four absolute magnitude intervals for the field f4 with a curve of single mode indicating the thin disc .",
