    "the evaluation of the thermodynamical , transport and optical properties of non - ideal plasmas is of great interest to characterize the behavior of the matter at different physical conditions .",
    "it has many applications in material sciences , geophysics and astrophysics .",
    "in particular , the equations of state provide the basic thermodynamic quantities needed to determine the physical properties of stellar envelopes and interiors .",
    "models of gases must also provide detailed atomic and molecular populations required to obtain the monochromatic opacity , a quantity which is essential to calculate realistic spectra emitted from astrophysical objects .",
    "our study is motivated by current difficulties of evaluation of gas opacities in envelopes of white dwarf stars ( wds ) .    while non - ideal effects on equations of state ( e.g. , departures from the ideal @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 relationship )",
    "become present at densities near to ionization pressure ( which occurs above @xmath4 g @xmath5 for a pure hydrogen plasma @xcite ) , signatures of non - ideal effects ( i.e. , particle interactions ) are evident in spectra emitted by gases at very low densities .",
    "as it is well - known since the earliest days of the quantum theory , interparticle perturbations are responsable for the reduction of the ionization energies , shifts of lines and modifications of their profiles @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the ionization potential along with the line merging , yields the advance of the series limits in the spectrum and forms ` pseudocontinuums ' , which resemble extensions of the bound - free adsorptions toward longer wavelength @xcite .",
    "pseudocontinuum opacities may produce strong modifications in the spectra of cool wds with rich - hydrogen envelopes @xcite .",
    "however , so far , the model atmospheres fail to reproduce in detail the photometric observations of wds with effective temperatures below @xmath6 k , and the source of discrepancies likely lies in the computation of gas opacities which are affected by non - ideal effects @xcite .",
    "current optical simulations @xcite , commonly used in the evaluation of wd spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) , are based on the occupation probability formalism elaborated by hummer and mihalas ( hm ) @xcite . on the basis of earlier works @xcite and the implementation of the technique of free energy minimization",
    ", the hm formalism assigns to each atomic state @xmath7 a probability @xmath8 of finding the atom in this state relative to that of finding it in a similar ensemble of non - iteracting particles . for the computation of optical properties , the quantity @xmath8 is considered as an estimate of the number of states of type @xmath7 that are available to be occupied ( _ bound level _ ) , whereas @xmath9 is a measure of the fraction of @xmath7-states that are severely perturbed by plasma interactions , such that an atom in this fraction is actually unbounded ( _ dissolved level _ ) @xcite . in this heuristic scheme ,",
    "a radiative excitation of an atom from a bound level to a dissolved level constitutes a pseudo - continuum absorption .",
    "althought this proposal seems intuitively right , we have recently showed that it is not self - consistent with the hm formalism @xcite .",
    "briefly , the optical simulations assume the existence of a fraction of atoms with perturbed electronic energies ( values shifted relative to the continuum ) , whereas the occupation hm formalism has been developed for particles species which have unperturbed energies ( ionization potential of isolated atom ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the atomic population which contributes to a pseudocontinuum absorption is overvaluated , because the abundances of perturbed atoms are calculated with lower bound energies than those assumed in their transitions to dissolved states .",
    "this may explain why such optical simulations yield a huge ( unphysical ) pseudocontinuum - lyman opacity for cool wds @xcite .",
    "since the starting level of these processes is the fundamental state , the overevaluation of the lyman pseudocontinuum is more severe than those of balmer and paschen .    while a group of gas properties ( equations of state and response functions , e.g. , specific heats ) may be calculated directly from the global distribution of particles ( mean densities ) , others , such as emissivities and opacities in general depend on particular population subsets . as an appropriate example , we mention the point of view adopted by the statistical theory of line broadening by pressure effects . there",
    ", the spectrum of a broadened line is determinated from a statistical sum , where the contribution of each radiating atom depends on the configuration of its surrounding particles @xcite .",
    "this picture can be also applied to continuum transitions .",
    "thus , an appropriate treatment of pseudo - continnum opacities could be developed on the basis of a formalism able to distinguish groups of atoms which , at a given instant , experiment different degrees of interparticle perturbation .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we believe it is physically significant and useful to develop a statistical mechanical formalism for gases based on the distribution of the physical space among the particles .",
    "the central idea is that to each particle is assigned a space region @xmath0 nearly related with the closeness of particle neighbors , and which is treated as a configurational parameter in the thermostatistical description of the gas .",
    "a particle with small space @xmath0 will have very near neighbors and , therefore , it will be subjected on the average to high perturbations , while a particle will be roughly isolated if it has a huge space @xmath0 assigned .",
    "this description offers an appropriate framework for the study of optical properties of gases .",
    "so far , the application of statistical mechanics in the analysis of space partition into a set of volumes has been circumscribed to some particular systems such as cristals @xcite .",

    "as a first step , the formalism developed in this paper is devoted to one - component gases at the limit of low densities .",
    "we formulate the theory in terms of the widely used _ free - energy minimization method _ @xcite .",
    "our aim is therefore to develop a helmholtz free - energy model for gases which contains a notion of space per particle , and to find the statistical equilibrium state and the thermodynamic properties of the system from the energy minimization with respect to the particle number density , subjected to specific conditions . since the present work concerns gases at low densities , we assume factorization of the free energy into configurational , translational and particle - interaction contributions .    the paper is organized as follows . sec .",

    "one of the most basic properties of a collection of objects is the division of space among them . the partition of space is commonly associated to processes that create random geometries .",
    "there is a considerable variety of physical systems which show stochastic structures .",
    "for example : biological tissues @xcite ; landscape geometries in agriculture and forestry @xcite ; territoriality zoology @xcite ; grains in foams and metallurgial aggregates @xcite ; intermolecular cavities in fluids @xcite ; solar granulation @xcite ; fragmentation of interestellar clouds @xcite ; stellar populations @xcite ; matter and void distributions in the large - scale structure of the universe @xcite .",
    "most of these systems have often been studied with computer simulation of stochastic , space - filling structures .",
    "a variety of geometric constructions have been applied in these analyses @xcite .",
    "gases in thermodynamic equilibrium are also typical disordered systems . in fact , althougth macroscopically homogeneous in the absence of external fields , these systems have spatial inhomogeneities at microscopic levels .",
    "the particles of a fluid move continuously and the instantaneous spatial concentration of material is non - uniform and fluctuating at different scales .    fig .",
    "[ f.f2d ] ( above on the left ) shows a group of objects random distributed in a surface , which represents a typical configuration of a two - dimensional ideal gas at a certain instant .",
    "we note that some particles are close enough among them while others are separated from their nearest neighbors by larger distances .",
    "one can then imagine a division of the space into a set of regions , one region per particle taking into account the closeness of its neighbors .",
    "the most likely well - known partition of space is given by the vorono tesselation @xcite .",
    "the _ vorono region _ of a given object is the collection of points in space nearer to that object than to any other .",
    "the complete set of vorono regions form the so - called vorono diagram of the system .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ f.f2d ] ( above on the right ) .",
    "there are , however , many other types of space divisions ( e.g. , generalizations of the vorono tesselations @xcite ) .",
    "it should be also observed that while the particle distribution of a perfect gas corresponds to a poisson distribution of points in the space , gases formed by interacting particles are characterized by other different distributions .",
    "thus , for example , the well - known one component plasma ( model of discrete positive charges in a continuous negatively charged background @xcite ) shows a long - range ordered ( or ` superhomogenous ' ) arrangement of particles , which can be appreciated from the analysis of the so - called power spectrum of the particle distribution @xcite .",
    "also the hard - body fluids show particular spatial patterns which have been studied extensively @xcite . as an example , the lower panels in fig .",
    "[ f.f2d ] show typical configurations of hard - disc fluids .",
    "it is evident that the density fluctuations of a gas in equilibrium depend on the type of interactions among the particles .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that the microscopical spatial structure of a gas in equilibrium corresponds to the most probable one according to the principles of the statistical mechanics .",
    "the present work is based on the assumption that the microscopical structure of a gas can be described by some class of partition of space among the particles , and that the most probable partition can be inferred using the formalism of the classical statistical mechanics .",
    "the region assigned to a particle , denoted @xmath0 , will be called the _ available volume _ of the particle because it gives a notion of the size of the particle - free space which surrounds it @xcite .",
    "we have mentioned that the division of the space occupied by the gas is not unique and , therefore , an exact definition of @xmath0 is non - trivial in advance .",
    "however , it is possible to establish a statistical formalism of the space partition in a gas without an explicit description of the volume @xmath0 .",
    "the application of the theory to the ideal gas allows us to identify the available volume in this simple system .",
    "this solution will provide a reference for understanding more complex systems composed by interacting particles .",
    "we consider a gas composed of @xmath10 particles in a @xmath11-dimensional container of size @xmath12 .",
    "the region @xmath12 is a segment , a surface or a volume for @xmath13 , 2 or 3 , respectively , although it will be called generically a volume . at low densities",
    "the state of the gas can be described using one - particle states .",
    "since we are specially interested in the configurational state of the gas , the translational description is here omitted and its well - known contribution to the fluid free - energy will be added later .",
    "the physical space occupied by the gas at a given instant is distributed among the @xmath10 particles . to each particle a certain volume @xmath0 is assigned ( so - called the available volume , see  [ s.sp_st ] ) of the total space @xmath12 .",
    "the statistical study of space partition can be performed based only on the constrains of normalization ( there is a volume @xmath0 per particle ) and space - filling ( the sum of all of them equals the total gas volume ) , without an exact specification of @xmath0 in advance .",
    "we represent the configurational state of the gas by an occupation number distribution @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of particles with available volumes between @xmath0 and @xmath16 .",
    "the physically allowed distributions must satisfy the following conditions @xmath17 @xmath18    _ configurational entropy . _",
    "the configurational entropy of the gas is represented by the boltzmann - planck expression @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath21 the number of configurational microstates of the gas which reproduce a specific state @xmath14 . following the usual procedure",

    "classical statistics of gases in equilibrium has been extended taking into account a new one - particle variable which assigns a space @xmath0 to each particle .",
    "we call this variable the available volume per particle since it roughly represents the free space around it .",
    "we develop the theory in terms of a helmholtz free - energy model for one - component gases at low densities where the particle interactions are assumed to be binary .",
    "the equilibrium state is calculated from the energy minimization with respect to the occupation number @xmath14 of @xmath0-states , subjected to particle number and volume constrains .",
    "the volume - closure introduces a lagrange s multiplier , here called @xmath76 , which regulates the space partition ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) and is equivalent to the pressure minus the density of interaction energy in the gas . a universal expression [ eq .",
    "( [ e.nv ] ) ] gives the occupation number @xmath14 for dilute gases at equilibrium .",
    "when the pair potential is specified , @xmath14 contains both thermodynamics and structure information of the fluid .",
    "we have illustrated the application of the theory to the perfect gas and to fluids with infinitely repulsive interactions , for one , two and three dimensions .",
    "all thermodynamic and geometric - structure properties such as the nearest neihgbor distribution function of these systems have been correctly reproduced .",
    "for hard bodies in two and three dimensions , the results are valid at low densities .",
    "it was also shown that the van der waals model can be derived from general kc potentials in a straighforward way .",
    "the identification of @xmath0 has been perfomed from the application of the theory to specific cases . for noninteracting particles",
    "the available volume is equivalent to the spherical volume enclosed by the distance between the centers of the particle and its nearest neighbor .",
    "in hard - body fluids , the core - repulsions reduce the value of @xmath0 with respect to that for fully penetrable particles . at the limit of low densities , the explicit form of @xmath0 for hard bodies",
    "is derived from the virial theorem .",
    "hard particles provide a guidance for the treatment of soft - cores present in realistic fluids . in these systems",
    ", we expect that the allowed values of @xmath0 will be a compromise between values associated with noninteracting particles and those corresponding to hard particles .",
    "additional work should be done on this topic . on the other hand ,",
    "there is no evidence that the identification of @xmath0 can be modified by attractive interactions .",
    "this is reasonable because attractive forces do not restrict the accessible space to a particle .    for non - interacting particles @xmath14 follows an exponentially decreasing law , such that most particles ( a fraction @xmath262 ) have spaces @xmath0 lower than the mean volume per particle ( @xmath263 ) . in conexion with the structure of fluids",
    ", we have showed that the double density @xmath106 could be a useful tool to characterize the order in fluids , particularly , through the standard deviation of the available volume @xmath0 .",
    "the main application of the formalism concerns with the atomic component of a partially ionized hydrogen gas .",
    "we found a statistically coherent and detailed evaluation of populations and internal energy changes of atoms as a function of the available volume per particle .",
    "preliminary calculations show that the distinction of atoms under different plasma - perturbations emerges naturally from the theory .",
    "this finding provides sufficient confidence for further extension of the formalism to consider a complete description of gaseous mixtures , where non - ideal effects on optical properties may be investigated .",
