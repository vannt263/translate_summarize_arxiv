    "laser control of molecular rotation , alignment and orientation has received significant attention in recent years ( for a review , see e.  g.  @xcite ) .",
    "interest in the field has increased , mainly due to the improved capabilities to manipulate the characteristics of the laser pulses ( such as time duration and temporal shape ) , which in turn leads to potential applications offered by controlling the angular distribution of molecules . since the typical rotational time scale is long ( @xmath0 ) compared to the typical short pulse duration ( @xmath1 ) , effective rotational control and manipulation are in reach . during the last decade ,",
    "coherent rotational dynamics of pulse - excited molecules was studied @xcite , and multiple pulse sequences giving rise to the enhanced alignment were suggested @xcite , and realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "further manipulations , such as optical molecular centrifuge and alignment - dependent strong field ionization of molecules , were demonstrated @xcite .",
    "selective rotational excitation in bimolecular mixtures was suggested and demonstrated in the mixtures of molecular isotopes @xcite and molecular spin isomers @xcite .",
    "these new methods for manipulation of molecular rotation can also be used to modify the motion of molecules in inhomogeneous fields , such as focused laser beams @xcite , or static electric @xcite and magnetic @xcite fields .",
    "a molecule near a solid surface can be also considered as a particle in a complicated inhomogeneous field .",
    "although the potential energy of a molecule near a solid surface is quite complicated in all its details , there are cases when simple potential models can be used .",
    "we treat below the molecule as a rigid rotor @xcite , while the surface is considered flat and is described by a hard cube model @xcite .",
    "this model was used and gave qualitatively correct results for @xmath2 or @xmath3 molecules incident with thermal velocities on close - packed surfaces , such as @xmath4 ( see reference @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "modification of the molecule - surface scattering and molecule - surface reactions by external fields of different nature is a long - standing research problem . in particular ,",
    "the effect of molecular orientation by a static electric hexapole field on the scattering process was investigated in detail @xcite .",
    "laser control of the gas - surface scattering was achieved using multiphoton ionization of the impinging molecules by long laser pulses of variable polarization @xcite , and possibility of controlling molecular adsorption on solid surfaces using ultrashort laser pulses was discussed @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the prospects of modifying and controlling the process of molecular scattering from solid surfaces by using ultrashort laser pulses that align molecules before they hit the surface .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the molecule - surface collision model is presented in sec .",
    "ii . next , in sec .",
    "iii , the model for the interaction of a molecule with an ultrashort laser pulse is briefly explained .",
    "then , we suggest two schemes for laser control of the molecular scattering process . in the first one , explained in sec .",
    "iv , a single laser pulse is applied to a molecular beam in order to cause the molecules to rotate with a chosen sense of rotation ( clockwise or counterclockwise ) after the scattering from the surface . in",
    "the second suggested scheme , explained in sec .",
    "v , two properly delayed laser pulses are applied to a molecular beam composed of two chemically close molecular species ( isotopes , or nuclear spin isomers ) . as a result of the double pulse excitation ,",
    "the subspecular scattering angles become enriched in one of these species after the scattering from the surface . in sec .  vi we summarize and conclude .",
    "in this paper , we use a model in which molecule is treated as a rigid dumbbell @xcite .",
    "this dumbbell collides with a flat frictionless hard cube , that represents one of the surface atoms @xcite .",
    "we assume that the cube has some velocity that is distributed according to the surface temperature .",
    "this hard cube model provides a simple way of adding surface phonons to the molecule - surface collision process . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we also assume that the cube is much heavier than the molecule , so that its velocity does not change as a result of the collision . in this case , by moving to the frame attached to the cube , one reduces the problem to the molecular collision with a motionless hard wall . in the moving coordinate system ,",
    "the molecular total energy ( translational+rotational ) is conserved , but it can be redistributed between these two parts as a result of the collision .    what about the translational linear momentum of the molecule in the moving coordinate system ?",
    "the component perpendicular to the surface is not conserved , because the surface exerts forces on the molecule in this direction during the collision . on the other hand , there are no forces applied in the direction _",
    "parallel _ to the frictionless surface , and therefore the linear momentum parallel to the surface is conserved .",
    "this is the reason why we can simplify the problem and consider a colliding molecule that has only a translational velocity component perpendicular to the surface .",
    "notice that this can not be done if the surface is corrugated .    using energy and angular momentum conservation laws ( as explained below ) , we find analytic expressions for the translational and the rotational velocities of the dumbbell molecule after the collision .",
    "these velocities depend on the velocities before the collision , and on the angle between the dumbbell and the surface of the cube at the moment of collision .",
    "finally , we transform the velocities back to the laboratory coordinate frame .    in the next subsections",
    ", we treat a simple case of a homonuclear molecule rotating in a plane and colliding with a heavy hard cube .",
    "next , we extend the treatment to a 3-dimensional rotation of a heteronuclear molecule . in the last subsection",
    ", we consider the effects of the surface cube vibration on the collision .",
    "we treat a homonuclear diatomic molecule as a massless stick of length @xmath5 , with two atoms , each of mass @xmath6 , attached to its ends .",

    "the total energy conservation for the molecule is : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the moment of inertia , and the subscripts @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the velocities before and after the collision , respectively . simplifying the above expression",
    "we obtain : @xmath18 or : @xmath19    * angular momentum conservation . *",
    "the angular momentum of this system of two particles depends on the choice of the coordinate system .",
    "we choose it such that at the moment of collision the origin is at the position of the colliding atom .",
    "thus , the other atom is the only one contributing to the angular momentum of the system .",
    "moreover , the torque exerted by the wall is zero for this choice of the coordinate system .",

    "the angles @xmath38 or @xmath39 are unique and are excluded from the equations above .",
    "the reason is that the treatment above is incorrect for this angle of incidence , because both atoms hit the surface at the same time , and the law of conservation of angular momentum , as applied above , can not be applied in this specific case .",

    "the reason is that for a flat and frictionless cube only the vertical velocity component can transfer energy to the impinging molecule",

    "the second species , that are rotationally cold ( and isotropically oriented ) , represented by dumbbells with square ends ( blue ) in fig .",
    "[ isotope_scheme ] , have a high probability to transfer their translational energy to the rotational energy , and they are mainly scattered to angles larger than the specular angle . as a result of the scattering process , the molecular mixture that arrives to the region of subspecular angles is highly enriched with the `` circular atom '' ( red ) species . at finite temperature of the surface ,",
    "the effect is somehow reduced .",
    "the reason is that even a non - rotating molecule can acquire translational energy from a vibrating surface atom moving towards it , and scatter to subspecular angles .",
    "however , for a strong enough laser pulse , a sizable effect is expected even for surfaces at room temperature .    to estimate the magnitude of the effect at typical experimental conditions , we consider scattering of a beam consisting of a 1:1 mixture of two nitrogen isotopes discussed above .",
    "the beam has initial translational velocity of @xmath112 , rotational temperature of @xmath113 , and it propagates at @xmath104 with respect to the surface .",
    "the surface consists of silver atoms , and the surface temperature is @xmath121 . before hitting the surface ,",
    "the molecules are excited by a pair of laser pulses of @xmath136 that are polarized along @xmath143 direction .",
    "the timing between the pulses is chosen such that one of the species remains rotationally unexcited , while the other one experiences an efficient kick of @xmath114 from the double pulse . in fig .",
    "[ isotope_hardwall ] we plot the distribution of the scattering angle for the two molecular isotopes .",
    "the upper panel of the figure corresponds to the unexcited component of the molecular beam , the lower panel corresponds to the selectively excited isotope . in both parts of the figure ,",
    "the distributions are peaked around @xmath144 .",
    "this peak comes from the translational energy delivered to the molecules by the thermally oscillating surface atoms .",
    "it is easy to understand the appearance of the maximum around @xmath144 by using the following simple arguments .",
    "consider a ball with velocity @xmath11 , colliding with a heavy cube moving towards it with velocity @xmath76 .",
    "this ball is reflected from the cube with velocity @xmath145 . treating the molecule as a ball , and keeping in mind that it hits the cube at angle of @xmath104",
    ", we arrive at a scattering angle of @xmath146 . using a typical value of @xmath147 for the velocity @xmath76 , and the incident velocity @xmath11 of @xmath112 we estimate the scattering angle as @xmath148 , which is consistent with the distribution maxima seen in fig .",
    "[ isotope_hardwall ] .    analyzing the distribution functions of fig .",
    "[ isotope_hardwall ] , we find that @xmath138 of the rotationally hot species are scattered to the subspecular angles , while only @xmath137 of the rotationally cold species are scattered to these angles , which means almost @xmath139 enrichment in the selectively excited isotope .",
    "this figure is remarkable by itself , however it becomes even more impressive at lower surface temperature . in fig .",
    "[ percent_temp ] we plot the percentage of the subspecularly scattered molecules for the rotationally cold species ( dashed blue line ) , and for the rotationally hot species ( solid red line ) as a function of the surface temperature .",
    "we observe that for any temperature between zero and the room temperature , there are more laser - excited molecules scattered to the subspecular angles , than there are the unexcited ones .",
    "the effect is enhanced dramatically for surface temperature below @xmath149 , and the ratio between the two isotopes asymptotically tends to the impressive value of 70 at zero surface temperature !",
    "this suggests that cooling the solid surface increases the effect to a large extent .",
    "we also explored the dependence of scattering on the laser polarization direction @xmath130 defined at the end of section iv . in fig .",
    "[ dependence_on_gamma ] we plot by the solid ( blue ) line the percentage of the rotationally hot molecules scattered towards subspecular angles as a function of the angle @xmath130 .",
    "we find that the percentage varies slightly with the polarization direction and that the maximal percentage is obtained for pulses polarized at @xmath131 .",

    "we developed a simple classical model , based on the hard cube model , for the description of the molecule - surface scattering process . using it and the classical model for interaction of molecules with ultrashort laser pulses",
    ", we suggested and investigated theoretically two possible schemes for modifying the process of molecule - surface scattering .    in the first scheme",
    ", we proposed a way to exciting unidirectional rotation of molecules .",
    "first , the molecules in the molecular beam are aligned by a laser pulse in the direction at some angle with respect to the surface .",
    "then , after the surface scattering , they were shown to rotate preferentially in a direction determined by the laser polarization vector and the surface normal .",
    "this anisotropy of the angular momentum of the scattered molecules can be detected , for example , by using the rempi spectroscopy @xcite .    in the second scheme",
    ", we suggested exciting a molecular beam consisting of two molecular species by two properly delayed laser pulses , in order to provide selective rotational excitation of one of the species ( similar to @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown , that these two species are scattered differently from a solid surface , in a way that allows for the enrichment of the scattered beam in one of these species for subspecular scattering angles .",
