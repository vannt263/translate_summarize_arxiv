    "it is considered that the results coming from atmospheric neutrino experiments  @xcite , as well as solar neutrino experiments  @xcite , are strong evidence of neutrino oscillation indicating the presence neutrino mass and flavor mixing . however , several alternative explanations to these results , which do not invoke neutrino mass and/or mixing , exist and are not yet excluded  @xcite . the interesting idea that gravitational forces may induce neutrino mixing and flavour oscillations , if the weak equivalence principle of general relativity is violated ,",
    "was proposed about a decade ago  @xcite , and thereafter , many works have been performed on this subject  @xcite .",
    "many authors have investigated the possibility of solving the solar neutrino problem ( snp ) by such gravitationally induced neutrino oscillations  @xcite , generally finding it necessary , in this context , to invoke the msw like resonance  @xcite in order reduce appropriately the solar neutrino fluxes with the specific energy dependence , required to explain the data .",
    "nevertheless we have demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that all the recent solar neutrino data coming from gallium , chlorine and water cherenkov detectors can be well accounted for also by long - wavelength neutrino oscillations induced by a violation of the equivalence principle ( vep ) . in this talk , we present updated fit of such gravitationally induced long - wavelength oscillation solution  @xcite to the most recent solar neutrino data which include the first gno measurement  @xcite .",
    "we follow the framework proposed in refs .  @xcite . in the presence of violation of equivalence principle ,",
    "neutrino mixing and oscillation can occur even if neutrinos are massless . in this work",
    "we assume oscillations only between two species of neutrinos , which are massless ( or degenerate in mass ) , either between active and active ( @xmath0 ) or active and sterile ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 being an electroweak singlet ) neutrinos .",
    "to describe the vep induced massless neutrino oscillation mechanism , phenomenologically , we can simply do the following replacement in the usual mass induced oscillation formula : @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mass squared difference , @xmath6 is the gravitational potential which is assume to be constant in our work , @xmath7 is the usual mixing angle which relate weak and mass eigenstates and @xmath8 is the mixing which relates weak and gravitational eigenstates , and @xmath9 is the quantity which measures the magnitude of vep .",
    "the survival probability of @xmath10 produced in the sun after traveling the distance @xmath11 to the earth is given by , @xmath12 where the oscillation wavelength @xmath13 for a neutrino with energy @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 \\left[\\frac{10^{-15 } } { |\\phi \\delta \\gamma|}\\right ] \\left[\\frac { { \\mbox{mev}}}{e}\\right ] , \\label{wavelength}\\ ] ] which in contrast to the wavelength for mass induced neutrino oscillations in vacuum , is inversely proportional to the neutrino energy .",
    "this energy dependence is very crucial in obtaining a good fit to the total rates without causing any problem with the sk spectrum  @xcite .",
    "we present here the results of our analysis only for active to active conversion since the results are qualitatively similar for active to sterile one  @xcite .",
    "-1.4 cm -0.7 cm -2.3 cm fig.1 : parameter region of @xmath16 and @xmath17 allowed by the total rates only for @xmath18 .",
    "the best fit point is indicated by the filled circle .",
    "[ fig1 ] 0.3 cm we performed the same statistical analysis as we did for three flavor vaccum oscillation solution to the snp in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is slightly different from our analysis in ref .",
    "we fit vep parameters @xmath17 and @xmath8 , and an extra normalization factor @xmath19 for the @xmath20b neutrino flux , to the most recent experimental results coming from homestake  @xcite , sage  @xcite , gallex  @xcite and gno  @xcite combined , and super - kamiokande ( sk )  @xcite .",
    "we present in fig .  1 the allowed region determined only by the total rates for fixed @xmath20b flux .",
    "we then present in fig .",
    "2 the result for spectral shape analysis fitting only the @xmath20b spectrum measured by sk  @xcite in the same way as we did in ref .  @xcite .",
    "finally , we perform a combined fit of the rates and the spectrum obtaining the allowed region presented in fig .  3 .",
    "the combined allowed region is essentially the same as the one obtained by the rates alone .",
