    "together with other surveys performed from the ground ( e.g. with scuba and mambo ) , our view about galaxy evolution in the infrared , submillimeter and millimeter range became more accurate .    with the information extracted from these cosmological surveys , and in particular from the source counts , the redshift distribution of the sources , the spectral energy distribution of the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) , and the analysis of the cib fluctuations , it is possible to build a coherent view of galaxy evolution and formation in the infrared and submillimeter range by developing models that fit all the available data .",

    "the availability of new space facilities in the coming years , such as the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) in early 2003 , astro - f , and later in the decade planck and herschel , and on the ground with the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , opens new perspectives to study in detail the population of infrared galaxies beyond z=1 .",
    "which galaxy populations these facilities will be able to detect ?",
    "what fraction of the cib will be resolved into sources ?",

    "it is a phenomenological model based on two galaxy populations : the ir emission of normal spirals where optical output dominates and a starburst population .",
    "each population is characterized by an sed family and an evolving luminosity function , described by a small number of parameters .",
    "the predictions of this model thus cover well the observed wavelength range from 8 @xmath2 to 3 mm .",
    "it does not include source clustering .",
    "the confusion is computed for the poisson contribution , and the clustering might slightly change the confusion limits ; this will be investigated in forthcoming papers @xcite .",
    "the model outputs as well as some programs are publicly available on our web pages .",
    "one of the applications of the model of @xcite to plan future observations , is the creation of simulated maps of the infrared and submillimeter sky .",
    "the main purposes of the simulations are : 1 ) to test the calibration and map making algorithms , 2 ) to test and validate the source extraction and photometry procedures , check the completeness , and 3 ) to test other algorithms , such as hires or band merging procedures , to improve source detections in the fir range .",

    "the maps , available for public use upon request , are sampled with 2 \" pixels and have sizes ranging from @xmath35 to @xmath36 ( 0.32 to 5 sq .",
    "the simulated maps contain three components : an extragalactic component ( ir galaxies ) , a galactic foreground component ( cirrus ) , and a zodiacal light component .",
    "the following is a brief description of each component .",
    "the @xcite model evolving luminosity functions are used to create the extragalactic component in simulated maps over a wide range of wavelengths relevant to today and future studies ( mainly for iso , sirtf , astro - f , planck , herschel , scuba , mambo , alma ) . for computational efficiency , we add in the maps sources only in the redshift range 0 to 5 .    the galactic foreground component , the cirrus , is build as follows : the spatial structure is taken from an actual 100 @xmath2 cirrus in the iras recalibrated maps of @xcite , and the scale extrapolation to smaller scales uses the properties of the cirrus power spectrum from @xcite .",
    "we then use the cirrus spectrum of @xcite to compute this component at other wavelengths .",
    "the zodiacal light component is a constant value in our maps , taken from tab.4 of @xcite for high ecliptic and galactic latitude fields .",
    "numerous authors @xcite have described the effect of the fluctuations due to the presence of point sources in a beam . for technological reasons limiting the telescope diameter compared to the wavelength",
    ", these fluctuations play an important ( if not dominant ) role in the measurements noise budget in the mid- and far - infrared , submillimeter and centimeter range for extragalactic surveys .    through the rest of the paper",
    ", we will use the term _ confusion limit _ for _ confusion limit due to extragalactic sources_. there are two different criteria to derive the confusion noise . the widely - used * photometric criterion * ( sect .",
    "[ photometriccriterion ] ) is derived from the fluctuations of the signal due to the sources below the detection threshold @xmath37 in the beam ; it was well adapted for the first generations of space ir telescopes ( iras , cobe , iso ) .",
    "the * source density criterion * ( sect .",
    "[ sourcedensitycriterion ] ) is derived from a completeness criterion and evaluates the density of the sources detected above the detection threshold @xmath37 , such that only a small fraction of sources is missed because they can not be separated from their nearest neighbor .",
    "we will show that with sirtf ( or other planned telescopes ) , we need in general ( regardless of the model used ) to compare the confusion noise given by the two criteria , in order not to artificially underestimate the derived confusion noise . in the frame of the @xcite model , we ll give our estimates for the confusion .      at a given frequency @xmath38 (",
    "hereafter the subscript @xmath38 will be omitted ) , let @xmath39 be the two - dimensional beam profile ( peak normalized to unity ) ; let @xmath40 be the source flux density ( hereafter flux ) in jy ; let @xmath41 be the differential source counts in @xmath42 .",

    "this can be rewritten as : @xmath55 we call @xmath56 the _ confusion noise _ , and @xmath37 the _ confusion limit_. there are different ways of deriving @xmath37 , and they will be investigated in sect .  [ photometriccriterion ] and [ sourcedensitycriterion ] . note that using eq .  [ eq : sigma_slim ] to determine the confusion limit is an approximation .",
    "a first refinement would be to use the limiting deflection @xmath57 rather than @xmath37 , as explained by e.g. @xcite , and then introducing the effective beam . for mips , this changes the confusion level by less than 10% .",
    "nevertheless , this refinement is not enough since it does not take into account other important parameters , related to the observational strategy and the analysis scheme , like the sky sampling , the pixelization ( or psf sampling ) , and the source extraction process , that also impact the confusion limit .",
    "only complete realistic simulations would allow to predict accurately the confusion level ; this next step will be addressed in a forthcoming paper using our simulations ( sect .",
    "[ sect : mapsimus ] ) .",
    "the method presented here aims at providing a theoretical prediction , which can be considered as a lower limit .",
    "before we obtain measurements of the telescope psf ( point spread function ) in flight , we need to use models of the beam profiles for the predictions of the confusion noise .",
    "a popular approximation is to use a gaussian profile with the same fwhm than the expected psf , although for sirtf an airy function should be more appropriate .",
    "the gaussian profile is useful for analytical derivations of the confusion level as a function of the beam size @xcite .",
    "we want here to address the question of accuracy using the gaussian approximation , the airy approximation , or the modeled profile .",
    "we compare the integral of the gaussian profile ( as written in eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma_slim ] ) with the simulated profile obtained by stinytim ( sect .",
    "[ sect : mips ] ) : this leads to a small error in the first integral in eq .  [ eq : sigma_slim ] at the order of 2 to 10% depending on the mips wavelength ; the difference is larger on the integral of the profile , about 30% .",
    "the gaussian profile is thus a good approximation for computing analytically the confusion noise , but not for source extraction simulations .",
    "using an airy profile gives better results for the profile integral , with a difference of less than 20% ; the difference on the profile integrated according to eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma_slim ] is worse , at the order of 10 to 35% .",
    "the airy profile is thus better suited for source extraction simulations than for confusion noise estimates .",
    "the use of the simulated stinytim profiles ( see tab .  [ tab : mips_psf ] ) is at present our best approximation of the flight profiles .",
    "indeed , @xcite have shown in the case of isophot that the theoretical profile is in good agreement with the actual profile .",
    "the * photometric criterion * is defined by choosing the signal to noise ratio @xmath58 between the faintest source of flux @xmath37 , and the rms noise @xmath56 due to fluctuations from beam to beam ( due to sources fainter than @xmath37 ) , as described in eq .",

    "notice that @xmath60 increases with @xmath58 , as given in the upper part of tab .",
    "[ tab : confusionmips ] . as a guideline ,",
    "if one assumes a power law for the shape of the differential source counts ( @xmath61 , with @xmath62 ) , then @xmath63 varies with @xmath58 like @xmath64 .",
    "this can be used in the euclidean regime ( @xmath65 ) .",

    "a second criterion for the confusion can be defined by setting the minimum completeness of the detection of sources above @xmath37 , which is driven by the fraction of sources lost in the detection process because the nearest neighbor with flux above @xmath37 is too close to be separated . for a given source density @xmath74 ( poisson distribution ) corresponding to sources with fluxes above @xmath37 ,",
    "the probability p to have the nearest source of flux greater or equal to @xmath37 located closer than the distance @xmath75 is : @xmath76 using @xmath77 , the full width at half maximum of the beam profile and @xmath78 , we parameterize @xmath75 as : @xmath79 fixing a value of the probability @xmath80 gives a corresponding density of sources , @xmath81 ( sdc stands for source density criterion ) : @xmath82 at a given wavelength , there is a one - to - one relationship between the source density and the flux , given by the source counts ; thus @xmath83 is determined with @xmath81 with our source count model .",

    "confusion becomes important for a source density corresponding to one source per 30 independent instrumental beams . on the other hand ,",

    "<S> we make predictions for the cosmological surveys to be conducted by the multiband imaging photometer for sirtf ( mips ) at 24 , 70 and 160 microns , for the guaranteed time observations and the legacy programs , using the latest knowledge of the instrument . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the detector noise and the cirrus confusion noise , we discuss in detail the derivation of the confusion noise due to extragalactic sources , that depends strongly on the shape of the source counts at a given wavelength and on the telescope and detector pixel sizes . we show that it is wise in general to compare the classical photometric criterion , used for decades , and the so called source density criterion to predict the confusion levels . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain , using the model of lagache , dole , & puget ( 2002 ) limiting fluxes of 50 @xmath0jy , 3.2 mjy and 36 mjy at 24 , 70 and 160 microns respectively . after taking into account other known sources of noise that will limit the surveys sensitivities , we compute the redshift distributions of the detected sources at each wavelength , and show that they extend up to z @xmath1 2.7 at 24 @xmath2 and up to z @xmath1 2.5 at 70 and 160 @xmath2 , leading to resolve at most 69 , 54 and 24% of the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) at 24 , 70 and 160 microns respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate which galaxy populations will be used to derive the luminosity function evolution with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we also give the redshift distributions of the unresolved sources in the fir range , that dominates the fluctuations of the cib , and a predicted power spectrum showing the feasibility of fluctuations ( both due to poissonian and clustered source distributions ) measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the main conclusion is that mips ( and sirtf in general ) cosmological surveys will greatly improve our understanding of galaxy evolution by giving data with unprecedented accuracy in the mid and far infrared range . </S>"
