    "over the past six decades the world went through a period of quick and remarkable urbanization . according to the united nations  @xcite in the year of 2007 , for the first time , the world urban population has surpassed the rural one and , if this process persists , two - thirds of the world population are expected to be living in urban areas by 2050 . on one hand ,",
    "cities are usually associated with higher levels of literacy , health care and better opportunities ; on the other hand , unplanned urbanization and bad political decisions also lead to pollution , environmental degradation , growth of crime , unequal opportunities and the increase in the number of people living in substandard conditions . in this sense",
    ", there is a vast necessity for finding patterns , quantifying and predicting the evolution of urban indicators , since these investigations may provide guidance for better political decisions and resources allocation .    fostered by this need and also due the availability of an unprecedented amount of data at city level ,",
    "several researchers have recently promoted an impressive progress into what has been called _ science of cities _  @xcite .",
    "these new data allowed researchers to probe patterns of the cities to a degree not before possible and one of the most striking and universal finding of these studies was the discovery of robust allometric scaling laws between several urban indicators and the population size . patents , gasoline stations , gross domestic product  @xcite , crime  @xcite , indicators of education  @xcite , suicides  @xcite , number of election candidates  @xcite , transportation networks  @xcite , employees from several sectors  @xcite , measures of social interaction  @xcite are just a few examples where robust scaling laws have been found . despite these intrinsic nonlinear relationships it is common to find works that try unveiling relationships between population size and urban indicators by employing linear regressions in the raw data ; also , per capita indicators ( that is , divided by population size ) are ubiquitous in reports of government agencies and are often used as a guide for public policies when analyzing the temporal evolution of a given city or for comparing / ranking the performance of cities with different population sizes .",
    "however , these linear regressions may result in misguided / controversial relationships  @xcite and per capita indicators are oblivious to the allometric scaling laws that make city a complex agglomeration that can not be modeled as a linear combination of its individual components  @xcite . in this sense",
    ", there is a paucity of alternative metrics for urban indicators that may overcome the foregoing problems and provide a fairer comparison between cities of different sizes as well as a better understanding of the city evolution .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have recently proposed a simple alternative to overcome these nonlinearities by evaluating the difference between the actual value of the urban indicators and the value expected by the allometries with the population size ( that is , the residuals in the allometric relationships ) .",
    "this scale - adjusted metric explicitly considers the allometric relationships and already have proved to be useful in the economic context  @xcite and for unveiling relationships between crime and urban metrics that are not properly carried out by regression analysis  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we follow the evolution of this relative metric for eight urban indicators from brazilian cities in three years ( 1991 , 2000 and 2010 ) in which the national census took place . by grouping cities in above and below the allometric laws",
    ", we argue that the average of this scale - adjusted metric provides a more appropriate / informative summary of the evolution of the urban indicators when compared with the per capita values ; it also reveals patterns that do not appear when analyzing only the evolution of the per capita values .",
    "for instance , while the per capita values of homicides have systematically increased over the last three decades , both the average of the scale - adjusted metric for cities above and below the allometric law are approaching zero , that is , cities where the number of homicides is above the expected by the allometry have managed to reduce this crime , whereas this crime has been increased in those cities where number of homicides is below the allometry .",
    "we argue that the nonlinearities may affect the per capita indicators by creating a bias towards large cities for superlinear allometries and a bias towards small cities for sublinear allometries .",
    "we further show that these scale - adjusted metrics are strongly correlated with their past values by a linear correspondence , making them particularly good for predicting future values of urban indicators through linear regressions .",
    "we have tested this hypothesis via a linear model where the scale - adjusted metric for one indicator in a given census was predicted by a linear combination of all eight metrics evaluated from the preceding census .",
    "these simple models account for 31%-97% of the observed variance in data and correctly reproduce the average value of the scaled - adjusted metric when grouping the cities in above and below the allometric laws .",
    "motivated by these good agreements , we present a prediction for the values of urban indicators in the year of 2020 by assuming the linear coefficients constants over time . by visualizing the predicted changes , we verify the emergence of spatial clusters characterized by regions of the brazilian territory where the model predicts an increase or a decrease in the values of urban indicators .",
    "we further report a list containing all the scale - adjusted metrics as well as the predictions for each city in the hope that government agencies find these informations useful ( ) .",
    "we start by considering the average of the per capita values for eight urban indicators described in the .",
    "this is a common practice of government agencies for tracking the evolution of a particular city or for comparing a group of cities with different populations .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] that almost all per capita indicators show a clear temporal trend : elderly population , female population , homicides and family income have increased over the years ; whereas child labor , illiteracy and male population have decreased ( the unemployment rates have evolved in a more complex manner , exhibiting no clear tendency ) .",
    "we could also list the cities in which these indicators have considerably changed or rank the cities that have made more progress in reducing , for instance , the homicide or illiteracy rates .",
    "-2.25in0 in        one of the main problems with this analysis is that it completely ignores the hypothesis that most urban indicators @xmath0 displays allometric relationships ( or scale invariance ) with the population @xmath1 , that is , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a constant , @xmath4 is the allometric ( or scaling ) exponent and @xmath5 stands for time .",
    "this simple relationship summarizes the ( average ) effects of increasing the population size on the urban indicators ; it states that cities are self - similar in terms of their population , in the sense that average properties of a given city can be inferred only by knowledge of its population .",
    "urban indicators are thus expected to display a deterministic component emerging from very few and general properties of the urban networks related to social and infrastructure aspects of cities  @xcite .",
    "when analyzing per capita values , it is implicitly assumed that the value of an urban indicator is proportional to the population size ( @xmath6 ) or , in other words , that cities are extensive systems .",
    "this idea is opposed to the complex systems approach of cities : complex systems are non - extensive ( @xmath7 ) , meaning that its isolated parts do not behave in the same manner as when they are interacting .",
    "cities have similar properties and only make sense as an entire `` organism '' and , in fact , there is robust evidence favoring the non - extensive and universal nature of cities ( that is , the urban scaling hypothesis ) across different cultures and historical periods  @xcite .",
    "thus , several properties of a city of a given size can not be linearly scaled for another city with larger or smaller population size .",
    "the dynamical processes mediated by the urban networks make the scale operation a nonlinear transformation for several urban indicators , often resulting in per capita savings of material infrastructure and in gain of socio - economic productivity  @xcite . from a more technical point of view , whenever the allometric exponent @xmath4 is different from one , there is a remaining component related to the population size when evaluating the per capita values of these urban indicators , that is , @xmath8 , which creates a bias towards large cities for @xmath9 and towards small cities for @xmath10 ; per capita measures are only efficient in correctly removing the effect of the population size in an urban indicator for @xmath6 . for our data , a complete description of the allometric relationships between the eight urban indicators and the population",
    "is presented in the , where we have confirmed the presence of allometries in our data as summarized in table  [ tab : allometric ] ( see also and ) .    .",
    "* allometric relationships between urban indicators and population size .",
    "* values of parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 obtained via orthogonal distance regression on the relationship between @xmath11 and @xmath12 for each urban indicator in the year @xmath5 ( see ) .",
    "the values inside the brackets are the standard errors ( se ) in the last decimal of the estimated parameters .",
    "the last column shows the values of the pearson linear correlation coefficient @xmath13 for each allometry in log - log scale . [ cols=\"<,^,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:2 ]      in addition of being autocorrelated with their past values , @xmath29 for the urban indicator @xmath30 also displays statistically significant crosscorrelations with @xmath31 for other indicators @xmath32 ( ) .",
    "these memory effects and also the fact that the residuals surrounding the relationships @xmath29 versus @xmath19 are very close to gaussian distributions ( ) with standard deviations across windows practically constant ( ) make these scale - adjusted metrics particularly good for being used in linear regressions aiming forecasts .",
    "we have thus adjusted the linear model ( via ordinary least - squares method ) @xmath33 by considering the relationships @xmath34 versus @xmath35 and @xmath36 versus @xmath37 . in eq .",
    "[ eq : glinmodel ] , @xmath38 is the linear coefficient quantifying the predictive power of @xmath39 on @xmath29 ( @xmath40 is the intercept coefficient ) and @xmath41 is the noise term accounting for the effect of unmeasurable factors . the results exhibiting the linear coefficients of each linear regression for the two combinations of years are shown in .",
    "we note that these simple models account for 31%97% of the observed variance in @xmath29 and that they correctly reproduce the average values of the scale - adjusted metric above and below the allometric laws for the years 2000 and 2010 only using data from the years 1991 and 2000 , respectively ( see ) .",
    "we have further compared the distributions of the empirical values of @xmath42 with the predictions of these linear models and observed that the agreement is remarkable good for the indicators elderly , female and male population as well as for illiteracy and income ( and ) .",
    "motivated by these good agreements , we proposed to forecast the values of @xmath29 in the year of 2020 ( next brazilian national census ) . in order to do so",
    ", we have considered that the linear coefficients @xmath38 are constant over time and employed the average value of @xmath38 over the two combinations of years used in eq .",
    "[ eq : glinmodel ] for predicting the values of @xmath29 .",
    "it is worth noting that by assuming @xmath38 constant , we are ignoring the evolution of socio - economic and policy factors . in an ideal scenario",
    ", one could track the evolution of the values of @xmath38 for achieving more reliable predictions .",
    "however , our data ( that is , the two values for @xmath38 ) do not enable us to probe possible evolutionary behaviors in the values of @xmath38 .",
    "even so , as pointed by bettencourt  @xcite , the dynamics of the urban metrics seems to be dominated by long timescales ( @xmath4330 years ) , and thus the approach of constant coefficients should be seen as a first approximation .",
    "the grays bars in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] show the averages @xmath44 after grouping the cities with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we observe that predictions for the average values basically keep the trends presented in the previous years ; for unemployment , in which the trend was not very clear , the predictions put this indicator together with most indicators , where the average @xmath19 has been decreasing for cities initially above the allometric law and increasing for those initially below .    in order to gain further information on the predictions ,",

    "each circle represents a city and the radius of the circle is proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "we color the circles according to the difference between @xmath44 and @xmath51 : shades of azure indicate that we expect a decrease in the values of @xmath44 , whereas shades of red show the cities where we expect an increase in the values of @xmath44 .",
    "the labeled cities are the capitals of the twenty - seven federal units of brazil ( the brazilian states and the federal district ) .",
    "the forecast for the values of @xmath44 were obtained through the linear model of eq .",
    "[ eq : glinmodel ] , where the linear coefficient @xmath38 were averaged over the two combinations of years @xmath52@xmath53 and @xmath54@xmath52 .",
    "we note that the changes in @xmath19 appear spatially clustered for most indicators , forming regions where most cities are expected to increase or decrease the value of the scale - adjusted metric . ]    for child labour , @xmath19 is expected to increase around three of the most densely populated regions that contain the metropolitan areas of so paulo , rio de janeiro and the metropolitan areas of almost all northeast capitals ; we further observe that a decrease in child labour cases is expected in mostly of the inner and southern cities .",
    "for the indicators elderly , female and male populations the clustering of the changes in @xmath19 is quite evident : elderly and female populations are foreseen to decrease in mostly of the northeast cities and display an increasing tendency in large part of the other regions ( male population behaves anti - symmetrically to the female population ) . in the case of homicides , our model predicts a decrease in @xmath19 for the vast majority of southern cities and we further observe a stripe near the east coast where @xmath19 is expected to decrease for mostly of cities ( both densely populated areas ) ; on the other hand , inner cities ( specially inner cities from the state of so paulo and northeastern region ) are expected to increase @xmath19 , suggesting that this violent crime may be `` moving '' towards less populated areas of the interior of brazil .    for illiteracy , again",
    ", the clustering of the changes is easily perceptible : we expect an increase in @xmath19 for mostly of the northeast and northernmost cities , while a decrease is predicted for the majority of the cities from other regions ( excluding several inner cities of southernmost region ) . for family income",
    ", we also observe a clustering in the changes where most northern cities are expected to increase the value of @xmath19 ( specially the inner cities of these regions ) , while for most cites in the central part of brazil are expected to decrease the value of @xmath19 ; these expected changes may be ( at least in part ) related to the `` bolsa famlia '' ( family allowance ) program  a large scale social welfare program of the brazilian government ( more than 14 million families were beneficiaries in 2013 ) for providing financial aid to poor families via direct cash transfer  because large part of the families receiving this aid are from the north and northeast regions .",
    "it is worth noting that for participating in the program , families must insure that their children attend to school and thus one would expect a reduction in @xmath19 for illiteracy in same regions that concentrate the beneficiaries of the program , which was not predicted by the model .",
    "this result suggest that simply enforce school attendance may not be efficient for reducing illiteracy , which can also be explained by common observed poor conditions of the public school system of those regions .",
    "finally , for unemployment , there is no clear clustering of the changes in @xmath19 , but instead we expect a decrease in @xmath19 widespread throughout the brazilian territory ( except in the southernmost region , where we note the prevalence of light shades of red ) .",
    "our article discusses that despite being widely used in government reports and also in academic works , per capita indicators completely ignore the universal allometric laws that appear ruling the growth dynamics of cities .",
    "we discuss that per capita indicators can be biased towards small or large cities depending on whether we have sub or superlinear allometries with the population size .",
    "we thus employed a scale - adjusted metric by evaluating the difference between the actual values of urban indicators and the ones that are expected by the allometric relationships . when investigating the evolution of the scale - adjusted metrics , we have reported patterns that do not appear in the per capita indicators .",
    "the scale - adjusted metrics also display a linear correspondence with their past values , a feature that facilitates the use of linear regressions for modeling the urban indicators . by employing simple linear models for describing the scale - adjusted metrics based on their past values",
    ", we verified that these models account for 31%97% of the observed variance and correctly reproduce the average values of the scale - adjusted metric . assuming the linear coefficients constant over time",
    ", we present predictions for the values of the scale - adjusted metrics in year of 2020 , when the next brazilian census will happen .",
    "we observe that the predicted changes for the urban indicators appear ( for most cases ) spatially clustered , that is , forming regions where most cities are expected to increase or decrease the value of the scale - adjusted metric . apart from this visualization of the predicted changes , we also provide a table ( ) with the values of the scale - adjusted metrics for the three past census data as well as the predictions for the next one in the supplementary materials .",
    "we believe that our analysis may find potential applications on development of new policies and resources allocation in the context of urban planing .",
    "finally , we note that the methods worked out here can also be directly applied in other contexts where allometries are present such as for economic indexes and biological quantities .",
    "the data we analyzed consist of the population size @xmath1 and eight urban indicators @xmath0 for each brazilian city in the years @xmath35 , @xmath52 and @xmath54 in which the national census took place .",
    "we filter these data by selecting the 1605 cities for which all the eight urban indicators were available , this corresponds to 28.8% of the total number of brazilian cities but account for 76.5% of the total population of brazil .",
    "these data are maintained and made freely available by the department of informatics of the brazilian public health system  datasus  @xcite .",
    "the eight urban metrics are defined as follows : _ child labour : _ the proportion of the population aged 10 to 15 years who is working or looking for work during the reference week , in a given geographic area , in the current year ; _ elderly population : _ the number of inhabitant of a given city aged 60 years or older ; _ female population : _ the number of inhabitant of a given city that is female ; _ homicides : _ injuries inflicted by another person with intent to injure or kill , by any means . _",
    "illiteracy : _ it gives the number of inhabitants in a given geographic area , in the current year , aged 15 years or older , who can not read and write at least a single ticket in the language they know ; _ family income : _ this indicator gives the average household incomes of residents in a given geographic area , in the current year .",
    "it was considered as family income the sum of the monthly income of the household , in reals ( brazilian currency ) divided by the number of its residents ; _ male population : _ the number of inhabitant of a given city that is male ; _ unemployment : _ it gives the number of inhabitant aged 16 years or older who is without working or looking for work during the reference week , in a given geographic area , in the current year . despite there being other definitions  @xcite ,",
    "the results presented here have been obtained by considering that cities are the smallest administrative units with a local government ( municipalities or _",
    "municpios _ ) .",
    "the other commonly employed definition is the metropolitan area , which is composed of more than one municipality and its is usually associated with the coalescence of several municipalities . as discussed by bettencourt _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the choice of the `` unit of analysis '' is crucial when studying properties of cities . regarding the scaling analysis :",
    "on one hand , the disaggregation of the correct urban definition can introduce a bias in the value of the scaling exponent ( either by reducing or increasing its expectation value ) ; on the other hand , the aggregation of the correct urban definition usually make the allometry more linear  @xcite .",
    "in fact , changes in the scaling exponents have been reported when choosing different definitions of city  @xcite .",
    "however , there is no fail - safe procedure for defining the correct boundaries of a city , also some urban indicators are actually more spatially restricted than others ( for instance , homicides versus family income ) .",
    "we have also analyzed our data after considering simultaneously the municipalities that do not belong to any metropolitan area and by aggregating the municipalities of the 39 metropolitan areas existing in brazil . despite the observation of relatively small changes in the scaling exponents ,",
    "our conclusions remain unaltered under this scenario .",
    "as we previously mentioned , several works have reported the existence of robust allometric relationships between several urban indicators and the population size .",
    "regarding brazilian cities , scaling laws already have been identified for several urban indicators  @xcite , mainly because of the existence of reliable data made freely available by brazilian agencies ( datasus and ibge ) . here , we want to confirm that the urban scaling hypothesis holds for all our urban indicators and if these allometries have been changed over time .",
    "specifically , we test the hypothesis that an urban indicator can be described by a power - law function of the population size , that is , @xmath55 , where @xmath4 is the allometric ( or scaling ) exponent and @xmath3 is constant . in order to do so",
    ", we have plotted the logarithm of each urban indicator against the logarithm of the population and adjusted a linear model via orthogonal distance regression ( as implement in the package ` scipy.odr ` of the python library scipy  @xcite ) to all these relationships .",
    "although the empirical relationships present different scattering degrees , they all display good quality linear relationships ( pearson correlation ranging from @xmath56 to @xmath57  see table  [ tab : allometric ] ) which are well described by linear models in log - log scale ( see fig  [ fig:2 ] and and ) . from table  [",
    "tab : allometric ] , we further note that the values of @xmath4 for illiteracy , family income and unemployment display a weak decreasing tendency over the years , while the other indicators show only small fluctuations ( no clear evolutive tendency ) .",
    "a weak decreasing tendency for unemployment also appears in the work of ignazzi  @xcite on the same data from the years of 2000 and 2010 .",
    "the values of @xmath4 thus classify our indicators in two groups : female population , homicides and unemployment have superlinear relationships with the population ( @xmath58 ) ; while child labor , elderly population , illiteracy , family income and male population have sublinear ones ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that despite the allometric exponents @xmath4 be close to one for elderly , female and male populations , the allometries between these indicators and total population are almost perfectly correlated , producing values of @xmath4 very close but statistically different from one .",
    "we further observe that the values of the allometric exponents @xmath4 reported here may slightly differ from previous - reported one due the different fitting procedures as well as different urban definitions ; however , these discrepancies are often very small ( for instance , by considering generalized least squares via the cochrane - orcutt procedure and another definition of city , ignazzi  @xcite have found @xmath60 and @xmath61 for unemployment , respectively in years of 2000 and 2010 ) .",

    "the scatter plots show the allometric relationships between the urban indicators ( from top to bottom : child labor , elderly population , female population and homicides ) and population size for the years @xmath35 ( red dots ) , @xmath52 ( blue dots ) and @xmath54 ( green dots ) in log - log scale .",

    "the matrix plot on left shows the values of the pearson correlation coefficient between the scale - adjusted metric @xmath19 for a given indicator ( one indicator per row ) in the year @xmath37 and all the other indicators in the year @xmath35 ( one indicator per column ) .",
    "the right panel does the same for the years @xmath47 and @xmath37 .",

    "we have calculated the average @xmath19 for the predictions ( gray bars ) after grouping the cities in above ( a ) and below ( b ) the allometric laws ( in that year ) and compared these results with the same averages evaluated using the empirical data ( blue bars for year of 2000 and green bars for the year of 2010 ) .",

    "<S> more than a half of world population is now living in cities and this number is expected to be two - thirds by 2050 . fostered by the relevancy of a scientific characterization of cities and for the availability of an unprecedented amount of data , academics have recently immersed in this topic and one of the most striking and universal finding was the discovery of robust allometric scaling laws between several urban indicators and the population size . despite that </S>",
    "<S> , most governmental reports and several academic works still ignore these nonlinearities by often analyzing the raw or the per capita value of urban indicators , a practice that actually makes the urban metrics biased towards small or large cities depending on whether we have super or sublinear allometries . by following the ideas of bettencourt _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> [ plos one 5 ( 2010 ) e13541 ] , we account for this bias by evaluating the difference between the actual value of an urban indicator and the value expected by the allometry with the population size . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this scale - adjusted metric provides a more appropriate / informative summary of the evolution of urban indicators and reveals patterns that do not appear in the evolution of per capita values of indicators obtained from brazilian cities . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that these scale - adjusted metrics are strongly correlated with their past values by a linear correspondence and that they also display crosscorrelations among themselves . </S>",
    "<S> simple linear models account for 31%-97% of the observed variance in data and correctly reproduce the average of the scale - adjusted metric when grouping the cities in above and below the allometric laws . </S>",
    "<S> we further employ these models to forecast future values of urban indicators and , by visualizing the predicted changes , we verify the emergence of spatial clusters characterized by regions of the brazilian territory where we expect an increase or a decrease in the values of urban indicators . </S>"
