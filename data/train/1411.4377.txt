    "although the nature is still not fully understood at present , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are widely believed to co - evolve with their host galaxies ( see kormendy & ho 2013 for a recent review ) .",
    "the concept of co - evolution mainly stems from two observational facts : 1 ) the tight correlations between the mass of the central supermassive blackhole ( smbh ) and several properties of the bulge of the host galaxy , including the velocity dispersion , luminosity and mass of the bulge ( e.g. , magorrian et al . 1998 ; gebhardt et al .",

    "( 2011 ) indicate a trend that agns with stronger blue asymmetries tend to be associated with younger stellar populations .",

    "the broad component is automatically selected by the criterion @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the specific flux of the line wing averaged within the wavelength range from 6500 to 6350  in the rest frame and @xmath24 the standard deviation of the continuum flux within the emission - line - free region ranging from @xmath15980 to @xmath16020 .",
    "the 1-dimensional spectra of the partially obscured agns are analyzed by the iraf package .",
    "the spectral analysis includes galactic extinction correction , transformation to the rest frame , starlight component removal and emission line profile measurement .",
    "the galactic extinction is corrected for each spectrum by the color excess @xmath25 taken from the schlegel , finkbeiner , and davies galactic reddening map ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , by assuming an @xmath26 extinction law of the milkyway ( cardelli et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the spectrum is then * shifted to the rest frame using the redshift provided by the sdss pipelines . the reduced spectrum in the rest - frame of a partially obscured agn sdssj095156.71 + 023602.0 is shown in figure 1 as an illustration . *      the continuum of the partially obscured agns is dominated by the starlight component emitted from the host galaxies .",

    "the leaking powerlaw continuum impacts the spectral shape at the blue end , which always results in an underestimate of @xmath3 index , and consequently a relatively younger stellar population if the contamination is ignored ( e.g. , cid fernandes & terlevich 1995 ; storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "2000 ; cid fernandes et al .",
    "2004 ; wang et al .",
    "2013 ) . strictly speaking , the best way to remove",
    "the underlying agn s continuum is to model the observed continuum by a linear combination of a power - law continuum and the used eigenspectra .",
    "this is , however , a hard task according to our experiments because of the strong degeneracy between the agn s continuum and the blue spectra of hot stars .",
    "the degeneracy typically results in a significant overestimate of the amplitude of the powerlaw component ( e.g. , cid fernandes et al .",

    "an alternative approach is adopted here to remove the underlying agn s continuum .",
    "a scaled powerlaw ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) is subtracted from each modeled starlight spectrum that is dereddened by the modeled local extinction in advance .",
    "the amplitude of the powerlaw is estimated from the tight @xmath32-@xmath33 relation ( eq .",
    "the relation finally yields a specific flux of the powerlaw at 5100 : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the measured line flux of broad h@xmath2 emission , and @xmath14 accounts for the effect on the flux due to reddening .",
    "we at first checked the effect of different powerlaw index @xmath2 on the measured @xmath3 value .",
    "the variation of powerlaw shape accounts for not only the intrinsic scatter of @xmath2 around its typical value of 1.7 ( e.g. , vanden berk et al . 2001 and references therein ) , but also the uncertainty due to reddening of agn s continuum .",
    "when @xmath2 varies from 1.5 to 1.9 , a tiny change @xmath36 can be obtained for @xmath3 , which is significantly smaller than the dynamical range ( @xmath37 ) of the measured @xmath3 .",
    "this result is not unreasonable because the specific flux ratio between the two powerlaws with @xmath38 and 1.9 has a shape @xmath39 , which is very close to a flat spectrum within the narrow wavelength ranges defining @xmath3 .",
    "the left panel in figure 2 compares the @xmath29 index measured with the powerlaw correction ( @xmath40=[1.7,1.0]$ ] ) with that without the correction .",
    "one can see clearly from the comparison : 1 ) as expected , an enhancement of @xmath29 value after the correction of powerlaw ; 2 ) the enhancement moderately increases with the measured @xmath29 .",
    "the increase could be understood as follows . in a spectrum with larger 4000  break ,",
    "the relative flux level contributed by a powerlaw has a more significant difference between the wavelength ranges blueward and redward of 4000 .",
    "the right panel shows the same comparison but in the case of @xmath40=[1.7,2.0]$ ] is used by taking into account of the factor of @xmath41 obtained in wang & wei ( 2008 ) .",

    "as expected , a stronger agn s continuum results in a larger @xmath3 enhancement and a more significant increasing of the enhancement with @xmath3 value .",
    "moreover , a larger scatter could be seen from the comparison for a stronger agn s continuum .    without a further statement ,",
    "the @xmath3 value measured after the powerlaw correction with @xmath40=[1.7,1.0]$ ] is used throughout the subsequent analysis . the effect on the results by different powerlaw level",
    "is discussed in section 5.2 .      after the removal of the starlight component , the emission - line profiles are at first modeled by the specfit task ( kriss 1994 ) in the iraf package in the emission - line isolated spectra for both h@xmath2 and h@xmath14 regions component is required to be separated from the observed line profile for the estimation of both smbh accretion properties and level of the underlying agn s continuum . ] .",

    "as discussed in wang & wei ( 2008 ) , although @xmath70 is an acceptable measurement of the accretion power in partially obscured agns , a systematical underestimate of @xmath4 and @xmath66 can not be avoided both because of the obscuration of the torus and because of the reddening in the broad - line region .",
    "our previous study obtained an upper limit of underestimate of @xmath91 for @xmath4 and @xmath92 for @xmath66 .",
    "the underestimate of @xmath70 could be learned in the left panel of figure 9 , which compares the distribution of @xmath70 between the used partially obscured agns and typical type i agns in greene & ho ( 2007 ) .",
    "the difference between the peaks of the two distributions is about 0.5dex .",
    "this difference is likely caused by the reddening and obscuration of the broad h@xmath2 emission .",
    "the middle panel compares the calculated @xmath66 between the two samples .",
    "a strong bias against small @xmath66 could be identified in the comparison .",
    "the bias is caused by our broad h@xmath2 selection .",
    "the selection is based on the high velocity h@xmath2 line wing over the wavelength range from 6500 to 6530  ( i.e. , blueward of [ nii]@xmath93 line ) in the rest frame , which naturally results in a significant loss of the objects with small @xmath94 .",
    "a similar comparison is shown in the right panel for the calculated @xmath4 .",
    "compared with the type i agns , the @xmath4 distribution of the partially obscured agns is systematically shifted to low @xmath4 end by an amount of @xmath951.0dex , although both distributions have roughly identical dynamical range of @xmath952.0dex . this systematical shift could be explained by the combination of the underestimate of @xmath70 and the selection bias of broad h@xmath2 line width .",
    "comparing with our previous studies , the current measurement of @xmath3 index is improved by subtracting an underlying agn s continuum from the observed spectrum according to the broad h@xmath2 emission . as stated in section 3.1 , there is an uncertainty for the moved powerlaw continuum due to the uncertainties of reddening and obscuration and the intrinsic scatter of the powerlaw index .",
    "we have demonstrated that the measured @xmath3 is more sensitive to reddening factor @xmath14 than to powerlaw index . a monte - carlo simulation with 1,000 random experiments",
    "is then performed to quantitatively examine the effect on the @xmath4-@xmath3 correlation caused by the uncertainty of removed powerlaw continuum level . for each object , a random @xmath3",
    "is produced by a random sampling of @xmath14 in the range from 1 to 2 .",
    "a spearman rank - order test is then performed for each of the 1,000 random samples .",
    "figure 10 displays the distribution of the simulated correlation coefficient @xmath96 .",
    "the distribution has a mean value of @xmath97 and a standard deviation of @xmath98 .",
    "the simulation indicates that the relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath3 is not sensitive to the uncertainty of the amplitude of the used powerlaw .",
    "] , although the relationship can be slightly degraded by the uncertainty of the level of the removed powerlaw continuum .",
    "the relationship between @xmath4 and stellar population age of host galaxy has been established by different approaches in past decade .",
    "this relationship allows us to establish a co - evolution scenario in which agns evolve from a high-@xmath4 state to a low-@xmath4 state as the circumnuclear stellar population continually ages . in a wide range of smbh masses",
    ", the majority of local smbh growth is found to occur not only in the high accretion phase but also in the galaxies with young stellar populations and with ongoing or recent star formations ( goulding et al .",
    "2010 ; heckman & kauffmann 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "wang et al . ( 2006 ) reported a relation between the ei space and middle - far - infrared color @xmath99 by performing a pca analysis on a sample of _ iras - selected seyfert 1.5 galaxies .",
    "this relation naturally indicates a relation between @xmath4 and host galaxy stellar population , both because the ei space is commonly accepted to be driven by @xmath4 ( e.g. , boroson 2002 ) and because the color @xmath99 addresses the relative importance of agn activity and starburst activity .",
    "a direct correlation between @xmath4 and host stellar population age is established either by using @xmath13})/\\sigma_*^4 $ ] as a proxy of @xmath4 in type ii agns ( e.g. , kewley et al . 2006 ; wild et al . 2007 ; kauffmann et al . 2007 ) or by estimating @xmath4 directly from the balmer broad lines in partially obscured agns ( wang et al . 2008 , 2010 , and this paper ) .",
    "the role of @xmath4 in the coevolution issue is additionally revealed from agn s hard x - ray emission , basing upon an identified correlation between agn s hard x - ray spectral index and stellar population age of the host galaxy ( wang et al .",
    "_    the evolutionary scenario mentioned above describes how agns ( strictly speaking , which parameters of agns ) co - evolve with their host galaxies .",
    "this phenomenological scenario , however , does not involve the background physical process that produces a self - regulated growth of smbh mass and host galaxy star formation .",
    "one can see from our statistical study that the feedback is a potential `` bridge '' that links and regulates the growth of smbh and host galaxy star formation . according to the aforementioned results ,",
    "a strong agn - driven feedback is required for an agn in its early gas - rich phase with both rapid smbh growth ( i.e. , high @xmath4 ) and young host stellar population , although the physical process that drives the outflow is still an open question .",
    "in contrast , a weak feedback is sufficient to regulate smbh mass growth and host star formation in the late gas - poor phase .",
    "the available models include agn s wind ( e.g. , crenshaw et al .",

    "in the current sample , the non - detection of the connection between radio emission and [ oiii ] line profile ( see section 5.4 ) allows us to believe that the radiation pressure is probably the initial driver of the outflows .",
    "matsuoka ( 2012 ) recently identified a deficit of extended emission - line region in the agns with high @xmath4 .",
    "the deficit could be explained by the agn s feedback that blows the gas around smbh away .",
    "moreover , the spectroscopic observations using integral - field unit suggest the similar signatures of outflow in high - redshift galaxies / quasars ( e.g. , nesvadba et al . 2008 ; cano - diaz et al .",
    "2012 ; harrison et al .",
    "2012 ) , where the outflow from agn is predicted to be much stronger than in local universe according to the model of cosmic galaxy formation ( see a more extended discussion on this issue at the end of this subsection ) .",
    "the revealed dependence between feedback and agn - host co - evolution provides an evidence that supports the hypothesis that the host star formation is regulated by smbh growth through the information provided by agn - driven feedback . both agn - suppressed and agn - induced host star formation have been proposed in past decades , although we can not say which one occurs in agns based on our current results .",
    "a commonly accepted mechanism that the feedback works is that the feedback from central agn sweeps out circumnuclear gas , which suppresses star formation and results in a self - regulated smbh growth and host star formation in both galaxies merger and secular evolution scenarios ( e.g. , alexander & hickox 2012 ; fabian 2012 ; kormendy & ho 2012 ; ) . in the color versus absolute magnitude diagram",

    "the excess implies that agns are at a transition from the blue cloud to the red sequence , which is likely resulted from a suppression of star formation due to the feedback from agns emission line and infrared emission indicate that these agns are in reddened star - forming galaxies , rather than in a transition phase ( e.g. , silverman et al .",
