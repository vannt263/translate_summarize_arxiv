    "the black hole x - ray transient ( bhxrt ) xtej1118 + 480  has proven to be a crucial object for understanding the class .",
    "it is one of the best objects for multiwavelength study as it suffers an exceptionally low interstellar extinction , allowing broad - band observations encompassing even the extreme - uv region ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it also stands out in possessing the shortest period yet known among objects with black hole primaries ( 4.1hr ) and has exhibited only low luminosity hard state outbursts , reaching just @xmath4ergs@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the increasingly dominant paradigm for understanding the emission from xtej1118 + 480 , and from hard state bhxrts in general , is that it ( usually ) involves an evaporated hot inner disk launching a compact jet ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the jet is responsible for not only radio emission , but also much of the ir , optical , and possibly even some uv emission .",
    "the properties of the unusual uv , optical , and ir ( uvoir ) variability also point to synchrotron emission rather than reprocessing of x - rays by a disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact it has even been proposed that the x - ray emission seen in the hard state could arise from synchrotron emission @xcite , although this is not widely accepted and may be overwhelmed by a larger comptonized x - ray component @xcite .",
    "part of the difficulty in bridging from the uvoir region to x - rays is that the former is likely a mixture of jet and disk emission , with the disk emission masking the break from flat - spectrum to optically thin synchrotron .",
    "consequently the position of the break , and slope of the optically thin component are not directly observable , increasing the uncertainty in extrapolating to x - rays .",
    "the variability may provide the key to disentangling these components . to test this possibility",
    ", we have assembled serendipitous multiwavelength observations of xtej1118 + 480  during the 2005 january outburst .",
    "the 2005 outburst was a much shorter and somewhat weaker event than that seen in 2000 .",
    "it was discovered optically by @xcite , with the first high points seen on 2005 january 9 .",
    "the outburst was also detected at x - ray and radio wavelengths ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the outburst faded rapidly , reaching near quiescence by late february @xcite . for a discussion of the outburst properties and longterm lightcurves",
    "see @xcite .",
    "xtej1118 + 480  was observed using the sara 0.9-m telescope located at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "observations used an apogee ap7p ccd camera with an @xmath6 filter .",
    "exposure times were 10s , with approximately 7s intervening dead - time .",
    "the raw data frames were bias- , dark- , and flat field - corrected using standard iraf routines . once the data frames were calibrated , we extracted time series aperture photometry using the external iraf package ccd_hsp written by antonio kanaan ( u. federal santa catarina , brazil ) .",
    "ccd_hsp automates the field alignment and photometry extraction for time - series ccd data .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     as a consistency check , we can insert the condition that material be optically thin ( @xmath7 ) into ( [ eqn : fluxthin ] ) .",
    "this gives us , @xmath8 using @xmath9  kpc , @xmath10  k and @xmath11  mjy .",
    "unfortunately then , while the thermal models do manage to reproduce the data equally as well as a power law , they require an emiting region comparable in size to the entire binary ( @xmath12 m ) .",
    "it is hard to envisage how this could arise from material within the primary s roche lobe .",
    "this difficulty suggests that , despite the attractiveness of the fit , the emission mechanism , in this case , is not thermal in origin , and hence that our original power - law fits are probably most meaningful .",
    "the properties of the variability we observe are very similar to those seen during the 2000 outburst , for example the prompt correlation with x - rays , the shape of the psd , and the increasing variability at longer wavelengths .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite concluded that synchrotron emission was the most likely origin of the variability .",
    "our multicolor observations provide strong support for this interpretation .",
    "we have argued that a thermal model , whether optically thick or thin , can not adequately explain the combination of spectral shape , luminosity , and variability timescales observed . the inferred ir spectral slope , @xmath13 is , on the other hand , quite appropriate for optically thin synchrotron emission .    in the context of the jet model for the broad - band sed of xtej1118 + 480presented by @xcite",
    ", this implies that the ir variability , and probably also the optical and some uv , originate from the `` optically thin post - shock jet '' component .",
    "this may indicate a difference from the models of @xcite in which the near - ir exhibits a flat spectrum , as this implies that the break between optically thin and partially self - absorbed synchrotron occurs at longer wavelengths than the near - ir .",
    "the slope we derive , however , @xmath13 , appears in good agreement with these models .",
    "our observations therefore provide new tests of these models , allowing isolation of the optically thin jet emission from contamination by the disk .",
    "@xcite consider a coupled accretion - jet model . in this model ,",
    "the ir emission is mostly due to radiation from the jets , although the contribution from hot accretion flows might not be negligible .",
    "the jet contribution is associated with synchrotron emission from electrons that are accelerated by internal shocks in the jets .",
    "the spectral distribution of the electrons is assumed to be of power - law shape , @xmath14 for @xmath15 , where @xmath16 . for optically thin synchrotron emission one",
    "then expects that the spectrum of the radiation is also of power - law shape , for the most part , with a spectral slope @xmath17 , which is already rather close to that which we observe .",
    "moreover , for xtej1118 + 480 , the ir emission may be associated with electrons near @xmath18 , so its spectrum deviates from the power law and is steeper @xcite .",
    "we have performed optical , ir , and x - ray observations of rapid variability in xtej1118 + 480  during its 2005 outburst .",
    "many characteristics are similar to the 2000 outburst , although there are a few key differences .",
    "superhumps , if present , are weaker than in 2000 .",
    "the variability also seems concentrated to higher frequencies .",
    "our major novel result is simultaneous @xmath19 photometry allowing us to isolate the sed of the ir variability .",
    "we find this is red , and can be well fitted by a power - law , @xmath20 , where @xmath2 .",
    "this result is consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission but hard to explain with thermal emission .",
    "we consider this to be strong evidence in favor of the interpretation of the variability as arising in synchrotron emission , most likely from a jet .",
    "unlike attempts to model the average spectral energy distribution ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , the variability isolates the synchrotron emission from the disk emission allowing us to measure of the slope of the optically thin component directly and show that the spectral break to self - absorbed emission must occur at longer wavelengths than the near - ir , at least at the time our observations were made .",
