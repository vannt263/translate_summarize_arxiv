    "`` _ can one hear the shape of a drum ? _ '' is a famous question posed by mark kac in 1966 @xcite , where to `` hear '' the shape of a drum is to infer information about the shape of the drumhead from the sound it makes .",
    "such a question can be traced back to hermann weyl @xcite .",
    "now , it is interesting to pose a gravitational - wave _ inverse _ problem for the forthcoming gravitational - wave astronomy by ground - based or space - borne detectors @xcite .",
    "to `` hear '' a source through gravitational - wave observations is to extract the information about the source from the gravitational waves it makes .",
    "it is of general interest to ask `` _ can one tell how many apples are falling in the dark of night ? _ ''",
    "one simpler question is how and whether two - body and three - body gravitating systems can be distinguished through observations of gravitational waves that are made by these sources .",
    "recently , this issue has been addressed @xcite .",
    "they found that there is a case that quadrupole wave forms for two - body and three - body gravitating systems ( in a particular configuration ) can not be distinguished even with observing the chirp , though different numbers of self - gravitating particles ( in different types of periodic motion ) are most likely to generate very different shapes of gravitational waves . in order to break this degeneracy between two - body and three - body sources in the particular configuration for the quadrupolar wave ( even with observing frequency sweep )",
    ", they suggested that higher multipolar wave forms ( octupole for their cases ) are needed .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate gravitational wave forms for a three - body system in the particular configuration ( as lagrange s orbit ) in more detail , especially in analytic manners up to the mass octupole and current quadrupole orders . in particular , we shall discuss whether and how the source parameters ( three masses , a distance of the sources to an observer , and their orbital inclination angle to the line of sight ) can be determined through observations of the gravitational waveforms alone .",
    "inspiraling and finally merging binary compact stars are most likely astrophysical sources for the forthcoming direct detections of gravitational ripples ( and consequently gravitational waves astronomy ) by a lot of efforts by the on - going or designed detectors @xcite . merging neutron stars and black holes",
    "have been successfully simulated by numerical relativity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , analytic methods also have provided accurate waveform templates for inspiraling compact binaries , by post - newtonian approaches ( see @xcite for reviews ) and also by black hole perturbation techniques especially at the linear order in mass ratio ( see also @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "bridges between the inspiraling stage and final merging phase are currently under construction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a growing interest in potential astrophysical sources of gravitational waves involving 3-body interactions ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . even the classical three - body ( or n - body ) problem in newtonian gravity admits an infinite number of solutions , some of which express regular orbits and the others are chaotic , and in fact an increasing number of periodic orbits are found @xcite . for the sake of simplicity , we focus on lagrange s equilateral triangle solution , mostly because it offers a nice model tractable completely by hand ( see below for more details ) .",
    "the linear perturbation analysis in newton gravity @xcite shows that lagrange triangular points @xmath0 and @xmath1 to the restricted three - body problem , in which one of three bodies is assumed as a test mass ( e.g. , an asteroid in the solar system ) , is stable if the mass ratio of the remaining two bodies is less than 0.0385 , though relativistic corrections to stability of the system are poorly understood .",
    "indeed , the ratio of the jovian mass to the solar mass is @xmath2 .    here",
    ", it is worthwhile to mention previous works .",
    "nakamura and oohara @xcite studied numerically the luminosity of gravitational radiation by n test particles orbiting around a schwarzschild black hole , as an extension of detweiler s analysis of the @xmath3 case @xcite by using teukolsky equation @xcite , in order to show the phase cancellation effect , which had been pointed out by nakamura and sasaki @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that their n particles are test masses but not self - gravitating .",
    "the aim and setting of the present paper are different from those previous works .    in this paper",
    ", we shall present an expression of gravitational waves for a three - body system in lagrange s orbit , especially as a function of mass ratios .",
    "in addition , we shall discuss how to determine the source parameters ( three masses , a distance of the source to an observer , and the orbital inclination angle to the line of sight ) through observations of the gravitational waveforms alone .",
    "we also discuss a possible test ; which source is a binary , a three - body system in lagrange s orbit or others ?    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we shall briefly summarize a notation and formulation for describing a three - body system in lagrange s orbit and its gravitational waves .",
    "wave forms at the mass quadrupole , mass octupole and current quadrupole orders are obtained in an analytic method . in section 3 , we discuss a method of determining the source parameters from gravitational - wave observations alone . a binary source test is also discussed .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the conclusion . in appendix , we shall present calculations for the chirp mass and some useful relations . throughout this paper , we take the units of @xmath4 .",
    "latin indices take 1 , 2 , 3 , except for @xmath5 which labels each body .",
    "for a wave propagation direction denoted by a unit vector @xmath6 , we define the transverse - traceless projection operator as @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the kronecker s delta symbol .",
