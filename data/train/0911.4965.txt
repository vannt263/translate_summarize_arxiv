    "the study of collective modes is a major tool to characterize and unravel the effects of interparticle interactions in a broad range of physical systems and in particular in experiments of ultracold atoms , where the scattering length can be tuned through feshbach resonances @xcite . for ultracold bosons the collective oscillation frequencies in single - component gases depend on the interaction energy and in multi - component gases they depend on both intra- and inter - species interactions ; for ultracold fermions the @xmath0-wave intra - species scattering length vanishes due to pauli principle and",
    "the collective modes depend on the interactions between the different components , so that their study is crucial in multi - component fermionic mixtures .    in the last decade ,",
    "the impressive experimental progresses in trapping and controlling fermi gases @xcite allowed their study in highly controllable setups : it became possible to lower the temperature to reveal degeneracy effects @xcite , tune the interactions to explore the bec - bcs crossover @xcite , superimpose optical lattices @xcite and polarize two - component fermi mixtures @xcite .",
    "collective modes in two - component mixtures have also been experimentally studied @xcite .    among these progresses , it recently became experimentally manageable to study three - component fermionic mixtures of @xmath1 @xcite and of @xmath2 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a degenerate fermi gas consisting of three different hyperfine states of @xmath1 was created : the three scattering lengths @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are different and tunable ; the collisional stability of the gas has been studied , showing rather long lifetimes when one scattering length is close to the unitary limit and the other two are small @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the interspecies feshbach resonances of a mixture of @xmath1 and @xmath6 were studied : the collisional stability has been recently determined @xcite , showing that a small sample of @xmath6 immersed in a two - component @xmath7 mixture is stable with very low loss rates for large negative scattering lengths between the two @xmath7 .",
    "these systems are particularly promising for several reasons : they offer a way to investigate new strongly interacting fermi systems ; thanks to their enlarged parameter space , they could present novel phases related to the formation of unconventional pairing and stability of trions @xcite ; moreover , the possibility of having many components with tunable interactions can be used to study mechanisms of color superconductivity @xcite and , in perspective , to simulate parts of the qcd phase diagram @xcite .    a natural way to characterize multi - component fermionic mixtures is provided by the study of their modes . for two - component fermi mixtures , collective oscillations have been investigated in several situations of experimental relevance @xcite ( see more references in the reviews @xcite ) and their behaviour studied when different parameters are varied : temperature , scattering length , polarization ( i.e. , the relative number of atoms of the components ) and mass ratio . the variety of possible dynamical regimes grows when the number of components increases : quantized vortices of three - component fermi mixtures with attractive interactions have been recently studied @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to discuss a simple way to characterize the properties of the collective oscillations of a general multi - component mixture . restricting to temperatures larger than the superfluid critical temperature ( see discussion in section ii )",
    ", we will describe the fermi gas mixture using the boltzmann equation , with no intra - species interaction . introducing a gaussian ansatz for the distribution function ,",
    "the equations for the small oscillations are determined : a convenient way to classify the different regimes in the parameter space is based on the study of the eigenvalues of the small oscillations matrix",
    ". once that the eigenvalues are found , the experimental quantities ( like the center of mass positions for dipole oscillations ) can be determined .",
    "the real part of the eigenvalues determines the damping of the quantities , while the imaginary part is related to the oscillations : we show that the number of peaks of the analytical continuation of the laplace transform of the physical quantities gives the number of real solutions ( at variance , the peaks of the fourier transform do not give the number of complex solutions ) .",
    "one can then classify the solutions of the linearized boltzmann equation through the number of real eigenvalues of the small oscillations matrix .",
    "a real root corresponds to an overdamped eigenmode , whereas complex ones correspond to oscillatory modes and purely imaginary to undamped oscillatory modes .",
    "the small oscillation matrix is real , therefore complex eigenvalues appear in pairs of complex conjugates and the number of oscillation frequencies is simply the number of pairs of complex roots . counting the overdamped eigenmodes ( i.e. the real roots ) ,",
    "one has a measure of the degree of collectivity of the system : the larger this number , the stronger the effect of interactions and trap confinement in reducing the degrees of freedom of the mixture .",
    "we will show that this approach is complementary to the study of the oscillatory frequencies , and convenient to classify the properties of the small oscillations solutions .",
    "we will focus on the case of dipole oscillations ( i.e , one - dimensional out - of - phase motion of the centers of mass of the various components ) , but the proposed classification works for general collective modes of multi - component fermionic mixtures .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in the next section we review the formalism of the boltzmann equation and the method of averages , applying it to a multi - component fermionic mixture and deriving the equations of motion for the centers of mass of the components . in section iii",
    "we study the dipole oscillations of a two - component mixture in harmonic potentials having different trapping frequencies : indeed , when the trapping frequencies are equal , two of the eigenvalues of the @xmath8 small oscillation matrix are purely imaginary due to the kohn theorem @xcite , while for different trapping frequencies one can have either @xmath9 or @xmath10 or @xmath11 real solutions , similarly to what happens for a three - component mixture with equal frequencies . in section iii",
    "we also recall that a convenient way to count the number of real eigenvalues is based on the sturm theorem and we discuss how to characterize the different solutions starting from the experimental quantities . in section",
    "iv we study dipole oscillations in three - component mixtures , presenting results for a mixture of three hyperfine levels of @xmath1 and for a mixture of two hyperfine levels of @xmath1 and one of @xmath6 , like in the recently reported experimental results @xcite . in sec .",
    "v we draw our conclusions and discuss possible further developments , whereas in the appendices additional material is presented .",
    "in this section we discuss the main properties of the boltzmann equation for a trapped multi - component fermionic mixture .",
    "consider a trapped balanced two - component fermi gas ; when the temperature @xmath12 is significantly larger than the fermi temperature @xmath13 , the gas behaves classically and is in the collisionless regime .",
    "decreasing @xmath12 , the frequency of collisions increases leading to a hydrodynamical behaviour . further decreasing the temperature @xmath12 ( but with @xmath12 larger than the superfluid critical temperature )",
    ", degeneracy effects become strong and one would expect the mixture to be collisionless again . for weak ( inter - species ) interactions , this sequence collisionless - hydrodynamical - collisionless actually occurs as @xmath14 decreases from values larger than one towards smaller ones . however ,",
    "if the interactions are strong ( i.e. , close to the unitary limit ) the sequence found in the experiments @xcite is collisionless - hydrodynamical as it would be in a classical gas ( i.e , without degeneracy effects ) : the gas remains hydrodynamical .",
    "this finding can be explained by taking into account in - medium effects : the in - medium enhancement of the cross - section compensates pauli blocking at low temperature leading to a hydrodynamical behaviour @xcite .",
    "in other words , classical statistics seems to work well when interactions are strong because pauli blocking and in - medium effects almost cancel each other . in summary , depending on the interaction strength , either degeneracy dominates or is compensated by medium effects and the low temperature behaviour is different in the two cases ; however , whatever the interaction strength is , for temperatures above @xmath15 the boltzmann equation framework with no intra - species interactions and classical collision term with no medium - effects for the inter - species interactions is found to work quite well , not only qualitatively , in reproducing the collective modes @xcite .",
    "we will take advantage of this finding , and describe the fermi nature of the particles simply by forbidding intra - species interactions . in multi - component",
    "imbalanced mixtures each component has its own fermi temperature @xmath16 , therefore we expect our scheme to work well above @xmath17 .    if we restrict ourselves to the normal phase ( that is , for temperatures above the critical temperature for superfluidity ) , each component of the mixture can be described by a semiclassical distribution function @xmath18 obeying the boltzmann equation @xcite .",

    "in this paper we used the boltzmann equation to study dipole oscillations in a general fermionic mixture : to discuss and classify the different solutions in the parameter space through it , we used the number of real eigenvalues of the small oscillations matrix , discussing how this number is related to the laplace transform of the experimental quantities .",
    "the small oscillation matrix for a @xmath19-component mixture has @xmath71 eigenvalues and the complex ones appear in pairs of complex conjugates : the number of independent collective mode frequencies is therefore given by @xmath260 .",
    "counting the real roots ( overdamped modes ) and the complex ones ( oscillatory ones ) are complementary descriptions .",
    "the reason why we chose the first one is to take advantage of sturm algorithm and laplace transform properties .    after deriving the equations of motion for the centers of mass of the components and discussing as a simple example the case of two components in harmonic potentials having different trapping frequencies",
    ", we studied dipole oscillations in three - component mixtures .    a @xmath19-component mixture where each component experiences a different trapping has a maximum of @xmath19 independent oscillation frequencies .",

    "on the contrary , if the trap frequencies are different , there is no purely oscillatory mode",
    ". the number of damped oscillatory modes can be at most @xmath19 and can be reduced down to @xmath9 : it is possible that there is no collective dipole oscillatory mode at all in the mixture .    in explicit computations we used the boltzmann equation with classical collision terms and without intra - species interactions",
    ": this gives , for strong inter - species interactions , results very close to the findings obtained including fermi statistics and in - medium effects thanks to a compensation of effects @xcite . using the classical boltzmann equation without intra - species interactions",
    "is expected to be a good approximation ( also far from the unitary limit ) at temperatures above @xmath17 , where @xmath16 is the fermi temperature of the component @xmath21 : for two components , e.g. , it well reproduces the experimental results for the scissor mode for these temperatures @xcite .",
    "we also observe that the explicit inclusion of the fermi statistics modifies the dependence of the relaxation times upon the system parameters , but not the dynamical equations for the centers of mass and their momenta and then the subsequent analysis based on the sturm theorem would proceed in the same way .",
    "the focus of this paper has been on the study of dipole oscillations , however we point out that a similar study can be done for different ( and more complicated ) collective modes : one has to write the small oscillations equations , and determine the number of real roots of the small oscillations matrix .    to conclude , we observe that multi - component mixtures are promising to study mechanisms of color superconductivity @xcite due to the possibility of having many components with tunable interactions : from this point of view , to study the collective oscillations ( and follow the modifications and the fate of the regions in the parameter space discussed in this paper ) when the temperature is lowered until the superfluid critical temperature can provide useful informations on possible intermediate , new strongly correlated phases .",
