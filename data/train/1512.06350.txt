    "statistical homogeneity and isotropy of the universe on sufficiently large scales is a crucial assumption which simplifies the study of large scale structure of the universe and cosmology as a whole .",
    "this assumption which is known as the cosmological principle is one of the fundamental pillars of modern cosmology .",
    "one can not derive this principle in a strictly mathematical sense and can only verify this by analyzing various cosmological observations and comparing them with the theoretical predictions based on it .",
    "so far the most compelling evidence of isotropy comes from the near uniform temperature of the cmbr over the full sky @xcite .",
    "this is further supported by multitude of evidences such as the isotropy in angular distributions of radio sources @xcite , isotropy in the x - ray background @xcite , isotropy of gamma - ray bursts @xcite , isotropy in the distribution of galaxies @xcite , isotropy in the distribution of supernovae @xcite and isotropy in the distribution of neutral hydrogen @xcite . but merely having isotropy around us does not guarantee homogeneity of the universe .",
    "one can infer homogeneity from isotropy only when it is assured around each and every point with the hypothesis that the matter distribution is a smooth function of position @xcite .",
    "unfortunately even the isotropy of the universe around us is not certain as there are mounting evidences in favour of significant anisotropy in the universe .",
    "the cmbr which is considered to be the best supporting evidence for isotropy is not completely isotropic . over the years",
    "many studies have reported power asymmetries and unlikely alignments of low multipoles @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite reported a @xmath4 deviations from isotropy in the planck data .",
    "there are other studies such as the hemispherical asymmetry of cosmological parameters @xcite , shape of the luminosity function of galaxies @xcite , hubble diagram of type ia supernovae @xcite , redshift - magnitude relation of type ia supernovae @xcite which find significant evidence for anisotropy . as a result",
    "it is not straightforward to infer homogeneity of the universe by combining isotropy with the copernican principle .",
    "most statistical tests to identify the transition scale to homogeneity rely on the number counts @xmath5 in spheres of radius @xmath6 and its scaling with @xmath6 which is expected to scale as @xmath7 for a homogeneous distribution . the conditional density @xcite measures the average density in these spheres which is expected to flatten out beyond the scale of homogeneity .",
    "the multifractal analysis @xcite uses the scaling of different moments of @xmath5 to characterize the scale of homogeneity .",
    "some of the studies carried out so far with these methods on different galaxy surveys claim to have found a transition to homogeneity on sufficiently large scales @xmath8 @xcite whereas some studies claim the absence of any such transition out to scale of the survey @xcite .",
    "bulk flow measurements on large scales provide another important test for the large scale homogeneity .",
    "the galaxy distribution as revealed by different galaxy redshift surveys ( sdss , @xcite ; 2dfgrs , @xcite ) indicates that the universe is highly inhomogeneous and anisotropic on small scales . the observed deviations from homogeneity and isotropy arise from peculiar velocities resulting from density perturbations .",
    "any form of bulk flows are expected to disappear on sufficiently large scales where the density fluctuations are very small .",
    "analysis of a large number of peculiar velocity surveys indicate statistically significant large cosmic flows on scales of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "combined studies with the wmap data and x - ray cluster catalog indicates strong and coherent bulk flow out to @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "contrary to these claims a recent study of low - redshift type - ia supernovae suggest no excess bulk flow on top of what is expected in @xmath11cdm model @xcite .",
    "if large scale bulk motions really exist then they indicate that there are significant density fluctuations on very large scales .",
    "the results from these studies clearly indicate that there is no clear consensus in this issue yet .",
    "the presence of inhomogeneities on very large scales has several important consequences .",
    "inhomogeneities , through the backreaction mechanism can provide an alternate explanation of a global cosmic acceleration without requiring any additional dark energy component @xcite .",
    "spherically symmetric radially inhomogeneous lemaitre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) models can account for the distant supernova data in a dust universe without requiring any dark energy @xcite .",
    "a large void can also mimic an apparent acceleration of expansion @xcite .",
    "fortunately such models can be constrained with observations such as sne , cmb , bao and measurements of angular diameter distance and hubble parameter @xcite",
    ". there would be a major paradigm shift in cosmology if the assumption of cosmic homogeneity is ruled out with high statistical significance by multiple data sets and it is important to test the assumption of homogeneity on multiple datasets with different statistical tools .",
    "@xcite introduce a method based on shannon entropy @xcite for characterizing inhomogeneities and applied the method on some monte carlo simulations of inhomogeneous distributions and n - body simulations which show that the proposed method has great potential for testing the large scale homogeneity in galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "@xcite applied this method to galaxy distributions from sdss dr12 @xcite and find that the inhomogeneities in the galaxy distributions persist at least upto a length scale of @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite show that the methods for testing homogeneity based on the number counts are contaminated by confinement and overlapping biases which result from the systematic migration and overlap between the spheres with increasing radii .",
    "these biases which are inevitable in any finite volume sample , artificially suppress inhomogeneities at each scale and particularly on large scales .",
    "recently @xcite use the count in cells method in dark sky simulations @xcite to show the spurious effects in the measurement of correlation dimension due to the confinement and overlapping biases .",
    "one can circumvent these biases by using number counts in independent spheres but the availability of only a very small number of independent spheres at increasing radii makes the statistics too noisy for most galaxy samples available including the sdss main galaxy sample . using count in cells method as well as new methods based on anomalous diffusion and random walks @xcite",
    "show that the millennium run simulation @xcite volume is too small and prone to bias to reliably identify the onset of homogeneity .",
    "we require galaxy distributions covering very large volume to serve the purpose .",
    "the luminous red galaxy distribution ( lrg ) @xcite extends to a much deeper region of the universe as compared to the sdss main galaxy sample as they can be observed to greater distances as compared to normal @xmath13 galaxies for a given magnitude limit .",
    "their stable colors also make them relatively easy to pick out from the rest of the galaxies using the sdss multi - band photometry .",
    "the enormous volume covered by the sdss lrg distribution provides us an unique opportunity to test the assumption of homogeneity on large scales with unprecedented confidence .",
    "we modify our method @xcite so as to carry out the analysis with non - overlapping independent regions upto sufficiently large length scales .",
    "we also analyze the lrg data with overlapping spheres and compare the findings with that obtained using independent regions to asses the suppression of inhomogeneities on different length scales due to overlapping and confinement biases .    beside analyzing the issue of cosmic homogeneity using the lrg distribution",
    "we also address another important issue in the present work . some studies reported to have found periodicity in the observed distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite find an apparent regularity in the galaxy distribution at a characteristic length scale of @xmath14 .",
    "it has been suggested that in an oscillating universe the oscillation of the hubble parameter can cause such periodicity in the density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "@xcite use the oscillations in the cluster correlation function to quantify such pictures of regularity in the galaxy distribution .",
    "the correlation function being an isotropic statistics smooths out the anisotropic signal and may not be the best statistics to describe such anisotropic structures .",

    "these studies suggest that there may be a characteristic scale present in the galaxy distribution other than the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) feature observed at @xmath9 @xcite . in an earlier study @xcite find that the inhomogeneities in the sdss main galaxy distribution persist at least upto a length scales of @xmath18 and we would like to test if the inhomogeneities in the lrg distribution exhibit any regularity on even larger scales .    throughout our work",

    "the contribution of poisson noise to the measured inhomogeneity decreases with increasing grid sizes due to the increase in the number counts inside them and becomes increasingly irrelevant on larger scales .",

    "we see that the periodic distributions and homogeneous poisson distributions both show inhomogeneity on small scales which decrease with increasing length scales .",

    "we get @xmath47 when the grid size is @xmath111 which also is the periodicity of the distributions .",
    "the inhomogeneity reappears again as the grid size exceeds @xmath112 and decreases once again and disappears exactly at @xmath113 and so on .",
    "this can be easily explained from the fact that these periodic distributions are highly inhomogeneous below the scale of their periodicity and become homogeneous at the scale at which they are repeated .",
    "once the grid size surpass this scale the distribution would again appear inhomogeneous by partial inclusion of the repeated patterns by the voxels .",
    "this behaviour of @xmath43 continues with increasing grid sizes and we get successive minima at repeated intervals of @xmath112 showing precise homogeneity on those length scales .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the inhomogeneity decreases in successive oscillations due to the decrease in the poisson noise with increasing grid sizes .",
    "the error - bars shown here are the @xmath114 variations from the @xmath1 monte carlo realizations used in each case .",
    "the extremely small size of the errorbars on the measured inhomogeneity at each node clearly indicates the presence of a periodicity in the distributions .",
    "this characteristic behaviour of inhomogeneity in periodic distributions is markedly different from the smooth decrease of inhomogeneity with increasing length scales in the homogeneous poisson distributions .",

    "the variations of @xmath43 as a function of grid size for periodic distributions with periodicity of @xmath115 and @xmath116 are shown in the top right and bottom panels respectively .",
    "we see similar periodic variations in the measured inhomogeneity at repeated intervals of @xmath117 and @xmath116 in the respective panels which clearly demonstrate the presence of periodicity in the distributions on those scales .",
    "this shows that our method can identify the presence of any regularity in a spatial distribution and quantify the scale over which the patterns are repeated .",
    "we show the inhomogeneity @xmath43 in the lrg distribution and a homogeneous poisson distribution as a function of length scales in the top left panel of when the data is analyzed with independent voxels .",
    "we find that both distributions show inhomogeneity on small scales but the degree of inhomogeneity observed in the lrg distribution is higher than that of a homogeneous poisson distribution at each length scales .",
    "this indicates that the lrgs are not distributed randomly and the amount of information encoded in the lrg distribution is higher as compared to a homogeneous poisson distribution at each scale .",
    "the degree of inhomogeneity in both the lrg and poisson distribution decrease with increasing length scales but the inhomogeneity in the poisson distribution decays much faster as compared to the lrg distribution .",
    "this can be explained from the fact that the information in the lrg distribution is sourced by the gravitational clustering and poisson noise whereas for the poisson distribution the contribution solely comes from the shot noise which becomes increasingly less important on larger length scales . in the top right panel",
    "of we show the inhomogeneity @xmath118 in the lrg distribution as a function of length scales when the analysis is carried out with overlapping spheres .",
    "we find that the distribution appears to be homogeneous on small scales .",
    "the degree of inhomogeneity suddenly rises at a certain length scale after which it gradually decreases with increasing length scales as seen earlier in the top left panel of .",
    "this characteristic behaviour giving rise to a bump in the inhomogeneity at a given scale arise due to the near uniformity in the distribution on length scale below its mean inter particle separation .",
    "it may be noted that the peak of the bump is located at @xmath119 which is the mean intergalactic separation in our lrg sample .",
    "a poisson distribution is expected to become homogeneous on a scale of the average size of voids in the distribution @xcite .",
    "this is closely related to the mean inter - particle separation and one would expect a poisson distribution to become homogeneous above this length scale .",
    "but we find a large degree of inhomogeneity in the lrg distribution on these length scales .",
    "further we notice that the degree of inhomogeneity in the top right panel is smaller than that in the top left panel at each length scales .",
    "these differences are caused by the suppression of inhomogeneities due to confinement and overlapping biases @xcite which result from the finite volume and progressive overlaps between the measuring spheres with increasing radii . in the bottom left panel of",
    "we show the ratio of inhomogeneities measured at different length scales using independent voxels and overlapping spheres .",
    "we find that the inhomogeneities are suppressed by a factor of @xmath120 upto @xmath121 and by a factor of @xmath1 on even larger scales in the overlapping measurements .",
    "the ratio shows a sudden drop at @xmath122 due to the unavailability of sufficient independent voxels beyond this length scale .",
    "the results clearly demonstrate the suppression of inhomogeneities on larger length scales when the measuring spheres are allowed to overlap .",
    "all the methods for testing homogeneity which are based on the number counts @xmath5 in spheres of radius @xmath6 are equally affected by these biases .",
    "therefore these biases should be properly taken into account in their applications .    in the left panel of we show how the number of available voxels vary with length scales when independent voxels are used for the analysis .",
    "clearly the number of voxels decreases with increasing grid sizes due to the finite volume of the survey region .",
    "we see that the number of independent voxels drops below @xmath1 around @xmath123 and we decide not to consider the scales beyond this in our analysis .",
    "the right panel of show the number of available centres as a function of the radius of the spheres when overlapping spheres are used for the analysis .",
    "clearly in this method one can go upto a larger length scales albeit by compromising with larger degree of overlaps between the measuring spheres resulting into a greater degree of suppression in inhomogeneity .",
    "we see that one can extend this analysis upto @xmath124 requiring at least @xmath125 overlapping spheres .",
    "it may be noted in the top right panel of that @xmath118 decreases to @xmath126 at @xmath116 and show very little variation thereafter despite the increasing degree of overlaps between the measuring spheres .",
    "the value of @xmath43 in the top left panel of also exhibit a quite similar behaviour where its value decreases to @xmath127 at @xmath116 and show a flattening which abruptly drops to @xmath128 at @xmath129 .",
    "we do not attach any statistical significance to this sudden drop due to the non availability of sufficient number of voxels on that scale .",
    "the degree of inhomogeneity at the plateau is somewhat different in the two methods .",
    "this difference could be attributed to the fact that inhomogeneities are suppressed by a factor of @xmath120 at @xmath130 when overlapping spheres are used ( ) .",
    "we note that @xmath125 independent voxels and @xmath131 centers of overlapping spheres are available at @xmath130 which trace a very small degree of inhomogeneity present on that scale",
    ". the minuscule degree of inhomogeneity measured with a large number of voxels or spheres at the plateau indicates that the lrg distribution is nearly homogeneous on these length scales .",
    "the lrg distribution is known to have a linear bias of @xmath132 on large scales @xcite and may have a larger variations in @xmath43 as compared to the homogeneous poisson distributions .",
    "currently we do not have any estimates for the variations in @xmath43 as we have only one distribution for the lrgs . keeping this in mind",
    "we conclude that the lrg distribution becomes homogeneous on scales of @xmath133 and beyond .",
    "our results are consistent with the earlier findings that the distribution of galaxies in the sdss main sample becomes homogeneous on and above a scale of @xmath134 @xcite . in the bottom right panel of we show the kullback - leibler(kl ) divergence or the information divergence for the lrg distribution with respect to a homogeneous poisson distribution on different length scales when the measurements are done with independent voxels .",
    "the definition and the significance of this measure is discussed in section 2 and this can be regarded as an alternative measure of inhomogeneity .",
    "it is interesting to note that the kl divergence also decreases with increasing grid sizes which is quite similar to the decrease in @xmath43 and @xmath118 with increasing length scales and a similar flattening is observed at @xmath135 .",
    "an important caveat to the present analyses arises due the fact that the comoving number density of lrgs varies with redshift and the lrg sample is considered to be only quasi volume limited @xcite .",
    "these variations could result from both the intrinsic fluctuations in the galaxy density field and the observational selection effects @xcite .",
    "we test how the presence of such fluctuations in number - redshift relation affect the scale of homogeneity inferred with our method . to test this",
    "we construct @xmath1 mock lrg samples each from homogeneous and inhomogeneous poisson distributions and randomly exclude points from them so as to finally have the same comoving number density @xmath136 in them as the actual lrg sample .",
    "the results for these analyses are shown in . in two panels",
    "of we see a small increase in the degree of inhomogeneity when an lrg - like number - redshift relation is enforced in the homogeneous and inhomogeneous poisson distributions .",
    "but we note that the variations of inhomogeneity with length scales in both cases still reflect the characteristics of the underlying distributions and the respective scales of transition to homogeneity in these distributions are not altered by the presence of such a number - redshift relation",
    ". however it may be worth mentioning that this test and its outcome rely on a smooth variation in the radial density due to either selection effects or intrinsic fluctuations in the galaxy density field and it is in general difficult to test for any other sources of such fluctuations in the number - redshift relation of lrgs .",
    "we do not see any periodic variation in the measured inhomogeneity @xmath43 of the lrg distribution ( ) in the range of length scales explored .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the variations observed in for periodic distributions .",
    "this indicates that there are no underlying regularities in the distribution of the luminous red galaxies at least within the length scales probed in the present work .",
    "one can extend this analysis to the lrg sample from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey of sdss - iii @xcite and future lrg sample such as from the eboss of sdss - iv @xcite to search for any periodic variation in inhomogeneity on even larger scales .",
