    "[ relay - channel ] .",
    "relay channels were introduced in @xcite and upper bounds on their capacity were derived in @xcite .",
    "full - duplex relay channels were first analyzed from an information - theoretic perspective in @xcite , where inner and outer bounds were derived and exact capacity expressions were obtained for special cases such as the physically degraded and gaussian degraded relay channels .",
    "the information - theoretic analysis in @xcite relied on cooperation between the transmitter and the relay induced by block - markov encoding .",
    "achievable rates in relay channels can be further improved via multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) technology @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the capacity of a mimo channel can scale linearly as the minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas @xcite .",
    "this encouraging result has led to research on multiuser mimo channels such as gaussian multiple access ( mac ) @xcite and broadcast ( bc ) @xcite channels .",
    "although discrete memoryless relay channels were analyzed decades ago , mimo relay channels have only recently been studied @xcite . as mimo is an integral aspect of industry standards such as ieee 802.16e @xcite , and relaying",
    "is also being considered for practical implementation @xcite , it is natural to consider the performance limits of mimo relaying . in particular ,",
    "mimo relaying has gained increasing attention recently , and results have been obtained in terms of capacity scaling laws in large networks @xcite , capacity scaling laws for two - way relaying @xcite and optimal precoder design @xcite .    in @xcite , a gaussian relay channel with multiple antennas at each terminal",
    "is considered .",
    "upper and lower bounds on capacity are shown for both deterministic and rayleigh fading channels .",
    "the lower bounds for the case of fixed channels in @xcite arise from a non - cooperative transmit strategy .",
    "higher achievable rates than those yielded by the non - cooperative approach in @xcite can be obtained by observing that mimo relay channels inherently contain more degrees of freedom than single - input single - output ( siso ) relay channels , where each terminal employs only a single antenna .",
    "we assume that the relay performs partial decode - and - forward operations , where the relay decodes a portion of the transmitter s codeword , encodes the decoded message using its own codebook , and sends the encoded message to the receiver . in a mimo relay channel",
    ", the channel eigenmodes can be exploited to optimize the cooperative role of the relay .",
    "thus , coding strategies such as transmit - side message splitting @xcite can increase the achievable rate for mimo relay channels .    in section v we consider a simple numerical example that illustrates the role that the channel eigenmodes play in optimizing the cooperative role of the relay for the mimo case .",
    "one scenario that we consider in section v involves the transmitter - to - relay vector channel being orthogonal to the vector direct link . in particular , this notion of orthogonality is a special case of the orthogonal relay channel considered in @xcite , where the general partial decode - and - forward strategy in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7 ) is shown to be capacity - achieving for both discrete - memoryless and gaussian cases .",
    "for the gaussian case , the cooperative role of the relay is optimized by power allocation over both components of the transmitter s codeword , which is analogous to power allocation over the channel eigenmodes for the mimo case .",
    "we present transmission strategies that rely on message splitting to support varying levels of cooperation between the transmitter and the relay in a mimo relay channel . in this policy ,",
    "the transmitter has two messages and chooses its codeword as a function of both of them ; the relay , though , only has to decode one of these messages .",
    "the key intuition behind the application of message splitting to mimo relaying is as follows : for the gaussian siso relay channel , while message splitting increases the average throughput @xcite , it is not a capacity - achieving strategy .",
    "this is based on the fact that in a gaussian siso relay channel , the received signals at the relay and the receiver can be statistically ordered . on the other hand ,",
    "the received signals in a gaussian mimo relay channel can not be statistically ordered . in particular",
    ", the channel eigenmodes determine the optimal level of cooperation between the transmitter and the relay in a mimo relay channel , which is measured by how the transmitter chooses its codeword as a function of both messages .",
    "we stress that our message splitting strategies are special cases of the partial cooperation approach in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7 ) . since a direct application of the general coding strategy in (",
    "* theorem 7 ) to gaussian mimo relay channels would require a computationally intensive optimization over several auxiliary random variables , we consider simplified coding approaches and obtain closed - form achievable rate expressions .",
    "we propose lower bounds on the capacity of the mimo relay channel by utilizing transmit - side message splitting . in particular , we consider both superposition coding and precoding at the transmitter . for the case of precoding in a gaussian mimo relay channel , dirty - paper coding @xcite is employed at the transmitter .",
    "our proposed lower bounds obtained via a combination of transmit - side message splitting and block - markov encoding improve on the lower bounds from @xcite that are obtained by a non - cooperative transmit strategy that does not employ block - markov encoding .",
    "the block - markov encoding that we employ differs from the approach in @xcite in that the relay cooperates with the transmitter over two consecutive transmission blocks to transmit only one of the transmitter s two messages .",
    "the non - cooperative approach in @xcite is actually a special case of our proposed strategies .",
    "we also perform a simple numerical analysis that illustrates how the achievable rate from our precoding approaches depends on the exact channel state and not just on the channel norms .    the rate bounds in this paper along with an initial version of the numerical results in fig .",
