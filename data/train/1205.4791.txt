    "there has been a wealth of history in analyzing periodicities in time - series data , particularly for variable stars .",
    "determination of periods in variable stars is a very fundamental issue in that they are used in many applications , including classification of variable stars , calibration of the period - luminosity relations , determination of the pulsation modes , detection of stellar rotation , detection of exoplanet transits and determination of the precession mode and frequency in accretion disks .",
    "these time - series data in practical astronomy are not usually sampled evenly in the time domain , and it is difficult to apply fast fourier transform ( fft ) directly as in other fields of science . alternatively , there have been well - established methods based on discrete fourier transform @xcite and on least - squares fit of sinusoids for unevenly spaced data ( lomb - scargle periodogram , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this type of method has been extended to extract finite numbers of signals by subsequently subtracting the strongest signals ( clean ; @xcite ) .",
    "another class of approach has been taken by evaluating dispersions either in sum of lengths between phase - sorted data @xcite or sum of dispersions in phased bins against trial periods .",
    "this class of approach includes @xcite , well - used phase dispersion minimization ( pdm , @xcite ) and analysis of variance ( aov , @xcite ) .",
    "yet another class of approach to estimate the power spectrum is by assuming a sum of @xmath0-function - like poles on a frequency space extended to the full complex space ( @xcite , chap . 2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this approach is generally referred to as maximum entropy method ( mem ) or autoregressive model ( ar ) .",
    "although this approach is potentially very powerful in detecting a small number of sharp signals in the power spectrum , the usage in practical astronomical data has been limited because the well - known quick algorithm ( burg algorithm ) using a recursive technique can only be applied to evenly spaced data @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there has been a remarkable progress in the field of compressed sensing , which deals with a class of problems in restoring or estimating sparsely scattered , finite number of parameters in a huge dimension .",
    "we present an application of this method to period analysis .",
    "the following description basically follows the mathematical formulation reviewed in @xcite . [ for a review of compressed sensing , see @xcite ] .",
    "we assume a time - series data @xmath1 with unevenly spaced times of observations at @xmath2 .",
    "the data are assumed to be subtracted for their average , and the mean of @xmath3 is zero .",
    "the observation can be expressed as a sum of signal ( @xmath4 ) and random errors ( @xmath5 ) : @xmath6 we assume that the signal is composed of a sum of strictly periodic functions . using sine and cosine fourier components , @xmath4 can be expressed as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are frequencies and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are amplitudes .",
    "the problem can be set to estimate @xmath9 and @xmath10 from @xmath3 .",
    "if the number of different @xmath8 is larger than the half number of observations , the equation can not be solved uniquely . rewriting @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are number of observations and number of different @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "we can rewrite a set of equations [ equ : obserror ] and [ equ : fouriersum ] as a form of @xmath15 using a @xmath16 observation matrix @xmath17 composed of @xmath18 we define @xmath19 as the vector to be estimated .",
    "the problem is to estimate sparse @xmath19 , i.e. , with only small number of non - zero elements , under the restriction of @xmath20 , if the time - series data is expected to have only a few periodic components , which is often the case with period analysis .",
    "we define `` 0-norm '' @xmath21 as the number of non - zero elements in @xmath19 .",
    "the problem can be then formalized to choose @xmath19 : @xmath22 this estimate is called @xmath23 regularization , and is known to be very robust in this problem setting .",
    "the problem , however , is that @xmath23 regularization is computationally difficult , and is known to be an np - hard problem @xcite .    in order to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "the following alternative @xmath24-norms are usually employed : @xmath25 in particular , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) regularization has an advantage in that it can be solved by conventional ways : by introducing a vector @xmath28 composed of non - negative elements , the equation becomes @xmath29 and it is a well - known linear programming ( lp ) .",
    "most notably , it has been recently demonstrated that this @xmath27 regularization is also the sparsest solution ( @xmath23 regularization ) in most large underdetermined systems ( see e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there have been a number of methods using this @xmath27 constrained estimations . among them",
    ", @xcite presented a concept of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( lasso ) .",
    "this estimation has become well - known after the development of a fast algorithm , known as least angle regression ( lar ) by @xcite .",
    "the lasso is defined as : , @xmath30 , for @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "we here introduce a conceptual formula and avoided complicated use of normalization factors .",
    "the * glmnet * package in r automatically performs this normalization and we usually do not need to consider the normalization . ]",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath27-norm penalty function with a parameter @xmath34 having a value of @xmath35 .",
    "this estimate becomes identical with a least - squares estimation at @xmath36 .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath34 may be chosen by using the cross - validation technique : after breaking the data into two groups , use the one group for lasso analysis and use the rest of data for evaluation of residuals . mean squared errors ( mse ) were evaluated using several randomly chosen different partitioning of data .",
    "one can then estimate @xmath34 giving the smallest mse . in application to analysis of actual time - series data",
    ", it might be helpful to survey the response of lasso using different @xmath34 values , rather than fixing at @xmath34 giving the smallest mse , since the derived periods are not very different between different @xmath34 values , and since smaller @xmath34 gives smaller number of false signals , which is profitable when it is already known that only small number of signals are present in the data .",
    "an example of cross - validation diagram is shown in subsection [ sec : deltacep ] ( figure [ fig : cepdeltacv ] ) .",
    "we must note that the present application of @xmath27 regularization using sinusoidal functions is not unprecedented in astronomy , but that there was at least one in the pre - lar era in analyzing radial - velocity data @xcite based on the same scheme .",
    "we introduce the present method because time - series data in variable stars are commonly met in practical astronomy and are very suitable targets for the present analysis , either in detection of multiple periods or precise determination of the periods .",
    "furthermore , the development of lar algorithm and its public availability on a popular platform has enabled an application of the compressed sensing far easier to reach than in the time of @xcite .",
    "this lar algorithm has been implemented as the package * lars * in r softwarehttp://cran.r - project.org/@xmath37 . ] and we used this package combined with * glmnet * ( generalized linear model via penalized maximum likelihood ) as a wrapper , which also provides cross - validation results . see appendix for a sample code .",
    "we examined the response of this analysis to the artificial data . in order to reflect typical astronomical time - series observations , we used observations of @xmath0 cep by variable star observers league in japan ( vsolj ) , spanning 1906 through 2001 , with a total number of 2955 visual estimates having large gaps ( 19111944 , 19461955 ) and inhomogeneous density of observations ( figure [ fig : deltacep ] ) .",
    "we presented response to different @xmath34 values , we used natural logarithms throughout the paper . ] as well as the model at the smallest mse .",
    "( 88mm,50mm)fig1.eps    we used the times of these observations and replaced the magnitudes with artificial data .",
    "the first one ( figure [ fig : artdata ] ) is a pure sine wave with a period of 10 d with gaussian noises whose @xmath38 is the same as the amplitude of the wave . in this case , the true period was always reproduced within errors of @xmath39 d. only small noises appear when @xmath34 is very small .",
    "( 60mm,120mm)fig2.eps    the second case is with gaussian noises five times larger than the amplitude of the wave ( figure [ fig : artdata2 ] ) .",
    "( 60mm,120mm)fig3.eps    in this case , the signal was completely lost when @xmath34 is small ( over - expression of the noises by fourier components ) .",
    "this result indicates that we need to choose adequate @xmath34 depending on the signal - to - noise ratio of the data . the model with the smallest mse",
    "is found to be an adequate solution in this case .",
    "the third case is the asymmetric waveform .",
    "we added second overtone ( a period of 5 d ) having a half amplitude of the primary wave .",
    "the noises were as in the first case ( figure [ fig : artdata3 ] ) .",
    "( 60mm,120mm)fig4.eps    the estimates of the period were observed to slightly deviate from the correct value ( typically 2 10@xmath40 d ) , and the deviation depends on @xmath34 .",
    "( 60mm,120mm)fig5.eps    we allowed two spectral windows 9.910.1 d and 4.955.05 d and obtained figure [ fig : artdata4 ] . after allowing the second window ,",
    "the main period was more clearly detected .",
    "if cycle numbers are sufficient as in this case , asymmetric profiles did not significantly affect the results .",
    "we then examined the ability of this lasso estimate for identifying very closely separated signals .",
    "we analyzed a combination of two periods of 10 d and 10.005 d and they were always detected as separate signals regardless of the different sequence of random numbers used to add noises ( figure [ fig : artdata5 ] ) .",
    "assuming an effective baseline of 15000 d , these two periods correspond to a difference of 0.75 cycle between the limits of the baseline . in a case of 10 d and 10.001 d , we could resolve the signals in about half trials .",
    "it was impossible to resolve a combination of 10 d and 10.0005 d. this degree of resolution is , naturally , far beyond the reach of conventional techniques , such as pdm and fourier - type analysis .",
    "( 60mm,120mm)fig6.eps      we performed an analysis of @xmath0 cep itself .",
    "the examined periods were 1000 equally spaced bins between 5.36 and 5.37 d. since the peaks were very sharp , we enlarged the figure to show the profile ( figure [ fig : cepdeltaper ] ) .",
    "the cross - validation diagram is shown in figure [ fig : cepdeltacv ] , which indicates that a combination of 540 frequencies best describes the data .",
    "the resultant ( strongest ) period was 5.366326 d ( in actual calculation , we used ten times smaller bins to obtain this precision ) .",
    "the period in general catalog of variable stars @xcite is 5.366341 d. the period obtained by pdm was 5.36629(4 ) d ( the error was estimated by the methods of @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "since lasso estimate is highly nonlinear as in mem , it is difficult to estimate the error of the obtained period .",
    "we alternatively performed delete - half jackknifing with random subsampling @xcite : randomly selected 50 % of observations and obtained periods from 10 different sets .",
    "the resultant 1-@xmath38 standard deviation was 0.000016 d. the estimate of the error appears to be consistent with the difference between our result and the gcvs period , and lasso estimate is several times more accurate than with the pdm in the present case .",
    "an addition of random typical errors ( 0.1 mag ) of visual observations did not affect the result , indicating that lasso estimate is very robust in detecting strictly periodic signal under the presence of large errors .",
    "( 60mm,120mm)fig7.eps    ( 88mm,50mm)fig8.eps      r sct is a well - known rv tau - type variable star , characterized by the presence of alternating deep and shallow minima .",
    "many rv tau - type variables exhibit irregularities and the regular alternations of minima are often disturbed .",
    "r sct is notable in its irregular behavior among rv tau stars ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported that fourier decomposition reasonably well expresses the observed features of the light curve , but that its predictive power is limited .",
    "since their fourier decomposition was not based on @xmath27 regularization , it would be interesting to see whether the periods selected by @xmath27 regularization equally well describe the light curve and whether the model based on these periods has a better predictive power .    the data used were vsolj observations between 1906 and 2001 ( 16767 points ) .",
    "we used two windows of periods 6080 d and 120160 d. the strongest signals were at 143.8 d and 70.9 d , associated with weaker signals ( figure [ fig : rsctpow ] ) .",
    "we used @xmath41 , which is the most regularized model with a cross - validation error within one standard deviation of the minimum .",
    "although the minimum mse was reached by @xmath42 , we did not adopt it because it was dominated by false signals and because it is physically less likely that such a large number of pulsation modes coexist in a radially pulsating star .",
    "it is noteworthy that the longer period is not the twice of the shorter period , in contrast to fourier analysis @xcite or our own analysis with the pdm ( 142.1 d and 71.0 d ) .",
    "these periods may represent fundamental and first - overtone periods close to the 2:1 , but slightly different , resonance which is expected to explain the rv tau - type phenomenon @xcite .",
    "( 88mm,50mm)fig9.eps    the lasso model seems to adequately express observations ( figure [ fig : rsctfit ] ) , indicating that varying amplitudes are basically a result of a combination of waves with periods close to the 2:1 , but slightly different , resonance .",
    "it would be noteworthy that interval with very low amplitudes ( e.g. jd 24510002451600 ) is well expressed by this model .",
    "figure [ fig : rsctexp ] presents an example of lasso predictions .",
    "the model soon lost the predictive ability after the end of the epoch ( jd 2452240 ) used for modeling .",
    "we also obtained a model to the same data restricted to jd before 2451000 .",
    "although the model well describes the observations used in the fit , it again loses the ability after the end of the epoch used for modeling ( figure [ fig : rsctfit2 ] ) .",
    "these results are similar to that in @xcite , and it is likely that a simple combination of multiple sinusoidal waves is not an adequate model for expressing the behavior of this object .",
    "this is probably caused by the chaotic nature of the pulsations in this star .",
    "( 88mm,176mm)fig10.eps    ( 88mm,176mm)fig11.eps    ( 88mm,176mm)fig12.eps      although equation ( [ equ : fouriercomp])-type bases are mathematically sufficient for ordinary fourier analysis , and this formulation for lasso analysis is adequate for many cases ( with sufficient number of data and length of time - series ) , the lasso response to even a simple cyclic function can yield split signals due to the lasso s characteristics of its norm .",
    "this is problematic because it results in erroneous estimation of periods .",
    "whereas we did not observe the problem in the examples presented so far , the problem can arise in certain applications of lasso - based methods to period analysis , and is therefore potentially harmful .",
    "we therefore discuss in this subsection what precisely the problem is , and then propose a means to circumvent it .",
    "this situation can be understood by a simple example .",
    "if observed data has a form of @xmath43 , the lasso result has an expected form of @xmath44 , unless @xmath34 is too small .",

    "if the observed data , however , has a form @xmath46 there are different solutions with equally acceptable squared residuals in a form of @xmath47 and @xmath48 which is preferred by lasso , and the result is observed as two signals at @xmath49 and @xmath50 around the expected signal @xmath8 . for a numerical example , a lasso application to the generated data for @xmath51 and @xmath52 in equation ( [ equ : sinandcos ] ) yields @xmath53 and @xmath54 for any @xmath34 in @xmath55 .",

    "@xmath60 were chosen to minimize @xmath61 in order to best illustrate the problem .",
    "the actual values of @xmath62 and @xmath60 selected by lasso are dependent on @xmath34 .",
    "for example , @xmath63 yields @xmath64 and @xmath65 , giving @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in this case ,",

    ". for @xmath34 larger than 0.008 , the former set of parameters ( with split signals ) gives a smaller @xmath72 .",
    "although a very small @xmath34 might improve the situation , such a small @xmath34 will spoil the advantage of @xmath27 regularization .",
    "although this difficulty can be avoided by introducing complex coefficients and @xmath73-type basis ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , this type of @xmath27 regularization can not be achieved by * lars * package . as an alternative ,",
    "practical approach to reduce this false splitting of signals , we have introduced an @xmath74 matrix in the following form : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the number of phase bins and @xmath77 .",
    "although the equation ( [ equ : fourierandphase])-type basis is not mathematically independent ( it is an `` over - complete '' basis or a `` frame '' ) , the non - linear response of lasso , caused by the characteristics of @xmath27-norm , enables us to detect an adequate frequency and phase at the same time .",

    "the effect of different @xmath76 on this artificial data is shown in figure [ fig : nk ] .",
    "since our present aim is to determine the single period precisely , we did not employ cross - validation , which increases the number of detected signals , but used a fixed @xmath84 . in the case of @xmath78 ,",
    "the reproduced signals are located on the upper and lower limits of the tested range . in the case of @xmath85 ,",
    "the separation between split peaks became smaller , and we could obtain a merged signal with @xmath80 . with an even larger @xmath76 , false peaks were more prone to appear .",
    "( 60mm,120mm)fig13.eps    using @xmath86 , which corresponds to the example in equation [ equ : sinandcos ] , we could obtain a reasonable result ( single signal ) with @xmath85 .",
    "the experiment suggests that false splitting of signals is expected to be avoided with @xmath76 up to 40 , even in the worst cases .",
    "we introduced lasso in obtaining periodic signals in unevenly spaced time - series data .",
    "a very simple formulation with a combination of a large set of sine and cosine functions has been shown to work very well , and the peaks in the resultant power spectra were very sharp .",
    "we studied the response of lasso to low signal - to - noise data , asymmetric signals and very closely separated multiple signals . when the length of the observation is sufficiently long , all of them were not serious obstacles to lasso .",
    "we analyzed the 100-year visual observations of @xmath0 cep , and obtained a very accurate period of 5.366326(16 ) d. the error in period estimation was several times smaller than in pdm .",
    "we also modeled the historical data of r sct , and obtained a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "the main two periods ( 143.8 d and 70.9 d ) were not exactly in a 2:1 ratio . the model , however , lost its predictive ability soon after the end of the data used for modeling , which is probably a result of chaotic nature of the pulsations of this star .",
