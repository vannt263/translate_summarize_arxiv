    "several theories of particle physics as well as cosmology predict the existence of at least one sub ",
    "ev scalar , that is , spin - zero , boson @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , many theories of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) can accommodate scalars with very small masses and feeble couplings to sm fields @xcite .",
    "an intriguing possibility in astrophysics and cosmology is that these weakly interacting , sub  ev particles ( wisps ) may constitute at least some component of the cold dark matter in the universe @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that these arguments apply for both pseudoscalar , namely axion  @xcite , and scalar  @xcite wisps , e.g. axion  like particles ( alps ) that couple to two photons .",
    "the current experimental programs that explore the parameter space of weakly interacting , light , spin - zero bosons include sensitive searches that make use of resonant cavities @xcite .",
    "scalar alps may be detected by stimulation of the conversion to photons in a magnetic field , similar to the way that axion conversion may take place @xcite .",
    "this conversion can occur in a suitable cavity that is properly tuned to the mass of the alp .",
    "while it should be noted that scalar couplings to two photons are strongly excluded by fifth force experiments  @xcite , it is possible that a low energy form factor could relax these constraints in some models  @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian that describes the coupling of a light scalar particle to two photons in the presence of an external magnetic field takes the form :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor , @xmath5 is the strength of the coupling between the scalar particle @xmath6 and two photons , @xmath7 is the magnetic field of the incident photon , and @xmath8 is the external magnetic field . from this lagrangian ,",
    "the equations of motion that result may be used to write the power @xmath9 that results from axion to photon conversion on resonance in the microwave cavity as  @xcite @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the cavity volume , @xmath12 is the form factor associated with the cavity mode , @xmath13 is the quality factor of the cavity , and @xmath14 is the assumed scalar alp density .",
    "the results presented here are the first from a search for primordial scalar particles coupling to a strong external magnetic field using resonant cavities in the mass range of 0.14 mev corresponding to 34 ghz frequency .",
    "the apparatus  @xcite consists of a tunable , 34  ghz resonant cavity ( q@xmath1510@xmath16 ) made from oxygen - free copper and a high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) cryogenic amplifier  @xcite located at the bottom of a cold gas cryostat that is oriented vertically and cooled to approximately 4  k. the cavity and cryogenic amplifier are coupled by approximately 10  cm of wr28 waveguide .",
    "the cryostat rests inside the vertical bore of a 7  t cryomagnet .",
    "the temperature inside the cryostat is monitored at multiple locations with cryogenic thin film resistance temperature sensors .",
    "the resonant cavity has one critically coupled and one weakly coupled port , each connected to wr28 waveguide .",
    "the critically coupled waveguide terminates at the input to the hemt amplifier , after which both waveguides feed out of the cryostat .",
    "the air in the cavity is pumped out through the weakly coupled waveguide .",
    "the q of the cavity is measured prior to each data run using a network analyzer connected to both waveguides .    the cavity is tuned with an adjustable plunger that is vacuum tight at 4  k. a fiberglass g-10 rod is threaded through the top of the cryostat and fastened to the tuning plunger with a horizontal lever .",
    "when the g-10 rod is turned , the plunger moves vertically .",
    "the range of tuning in the cavity is @xmath175  mm which corresponds to approximately @xmath170.8 ghz .",
    "the signal from the cryogenic amplifier terminates outside the cryostat at a waveguide  to  coaxial adapter and triple heterodyne microwave receiver  @xcite . after the receiver the voltages from the in  phase and quadrature components",
    "are digitized for the complex fast fourier transform ( fft ) and further analysis offline .",
    "the sensitivity of the experiment is limited by the system noise temperature @xmath18 according to the dicke radiometer equation  @xcite . @xmath19",
    "typical power spectra measured with the cryogenic amplifier held at 6 k are shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : results ] .",
    "the resonance of the cavity appears as a dip in the spectrum .",
    "this dip is qualitatively consistent with the combination of two effects : a frequency - dependent reflection of noise power coming from the input of the hemt , and a change in the gain of the hemt as the impedance of the source decreases ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the width of the dip is approximately 3 - 4 mhz which is in accordance with the cavity s q of 10@xmath16 .",
    "coupling from data similar to those shown in the left panel . in this",
    "initial result the measurements are centered at 34.29  ghz ( 0.142 mev ) and span across the width of the last bandpass filter ( 30  mhz ) .",
    "the gap in the center of the plot corresponds to frequencies at or near 0  hz in the baseband and have been excluded from this analysis.[fig : results],title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]   coupling from data similar to those shown in the left panel . in this initial",
    "result the measurements are centered at 34.29  ghz ( 0.142 mev ) and span across the width of the last bandpass filter ( 30  mhz ) .",
    "the gap in the center of the plot corresponds to frequencies at or near 0  hz in the baseband and have been excluded from this analysis.[fig : results],title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    the expected power from couplings between a scalar alp and 2 photons is given in equation  [ eq : power ]  @xcite .",
    "the cavity form factor @xmath12 , adapted from @xcite for the case of a scalar alp , is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the oscillating magnetic field in the cavity , @xmath22 is the static magnetic field , and @xmath23 is the magnetic permeability . for the configuration used in these measurements",
    "@xmath12=10@xmath24 is lower than would be desirable , but the cavity geometry was dictated by the constraints of a different experiment  @xcite . using a limited set of measurements similar to those in the left panel of figure  [ fig : results ] and assuming a primordial alp density @xmath14 of 10@xmath25/@xmath26  @xcite",
    ", the right panel shows that we exclude couplings with g@xmath010@xmath1/gev between 0.14 mev scalar particles and two photons with 5@xmath2 confidence .",
    "although the sensitivity of the present measurement does not exceed model - dependent limits on g@xmath27 set in previous searches for solar alps  @xcite , by astrophysical observations  @xcite , and by fifth force experiments  @xcite , it is the first glimpse into this energy regime with a technique that has mass resolution .",
    "it is also the first direct search for alps as cold dark matter at 0.1 mev .",
    "immediate plans for the experiment include a cavity in a transverse magnetic mode which will allow coupling to pseudoscalar alps and will be 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive than the present measurement .",
    "a wider mass range will also be searched by tuning the receiver . in conclusion",
    "although this measurement is primarily a first step toward the goal of a more sensitive experiment , it is still an unprecedented , narrow band test of @xmath28 coupling limits that are otherwise model - dependent .",
