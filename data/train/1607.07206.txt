    "if , in addition , the injection is continuous and constant ( @xmath31 ) , then our generalized solution becomes the same as in @xcite .",
    "the time dependence of the injection efficiency is an important factor in formation of the shape of the particle spectrum at all momenta .",
    "the high - energy end of the accelerated particle spectrum is formed by particles injected at the very beginning .",

    "the stationary solution of the shock particle acceleration predicts that the power - law index of the cosmic ray distribution @xmath229 is determined by the shock compression only .",
    "in contrast , in young snrs where acceleration is not presumably steady - state , this index ( let s call it @xmath327 to distinguish from the stationary index @xmath229 ) depends also on the indexes @xmath4 and @xmath62 in the approximate expressions for the diffusion coefficient @xmath3 and for the temporal evolution of the injection efficiency @xmath321 .",
