    "the focus of this paper is on the large - amplitude , or mira , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) variables .",
    "because of their high luminosity , and particularly their high _ infrared _ luminosity , stars in this group have huge potential as extragalactic distance indicators .",
    "i briefly describe what we know about the mira period  luminosity ( pl ) relationship , before going on to review recent work on miras in local group galaxies , contrasting those found in dwarf spheroidals with those in the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc6822 .",
    "miras are very large - amplitude ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 mag ) , long - period ( @xmath2 days ) variables .",
    "they are close to the maximum bolometric luminosity that they will ever achieve and they are cool , with spectra dominated by molecular absorption .",
    "stars with initial masses in the range from 0.8 to 8 m@xmath3 , possibly higher , are thought to go through the mira evolutionary phase . for most of their agb lifetime ,",
    "their nuclear energy comes from burning of the hydrogen shell .",
    "however , from time to time stars on the upper agb experience helium - shell flashes with far - reaching consequences for the stellar atmospheres .",
    "it is following these flashes that dredge - up can occur , bringing material from the core into the convective regime , and the atmospheric abundance can change from oxygen ( o)- to carbon ( c)-rich . in relatively high - mass agb stars , hot - bottom burning can also affect abundances , turning carbon to nitrogen and producing lithium , among other things .",
    "the relative fraction of o- and c - rich miras in any population is a function of both age and metallicity .",
    "early work on the mira pl relation ( e.g. , at @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) was published by feast et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and hughes et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . however , our understanding of this was greatly advanced when wood ( 2000 ) demonstrated that most agb and upper - giant - branch variables followed various parallel pl sequences . the mira pl relation , which had been known for some while , was just one of them .",
    "wood showed that the mira sequence corresponds to fundamental pulsation and includes most of the large - amplitude variables as well as a few of the low - amplitude , or semi - regular , variables .",
    "some of the o - rich large - amplitude , long - period ( @xmath6 days ) miras lay above the fundamental sequence , as had also been known for some while .",
    "the early studies of the multiple sequences used periods determined from microlensing studies , e.g. , from macho and ogle at @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and these results are now being refined as more systematic observations are made at infrared wavelengths . among other things ,",
    "the situation is obviously confused by the fact that many of the miras have circumstellar shells . in some cases these are so thick that they affect the position of the star on the pl(@xmath4 ) relation ( e.g. , ita & matsunaga 2011 ) . in those cases , it is preferable to work with bolometric magnitudes , if they can be reliably estimated , although it is sometimes possible to correct for circumstellar extinction .",
    "the miras which lie above the pl relation are an interesting subgroup that may be experiencing hot - bottom burning ; there is certainly evidence for lithium and other enrichment ( whitelock et al .",
    "2003 ; whitelock 2012 ; and references therein ) .",
    "it also seems possible that they are pulsating in the first overtone ( feast 2009 ) .    from the distance - scale perspective , the multiple pl sequences of the small - amplitude variables are not very useful , since it is unclear which sequence any particular star will be on .",
    "it is therefore only the miras , i.e. , the large - amplitude variables , that we consider useful for distance - scale studies and , where possible , miras with short periods ( @xmath9 days ) and thin dust shells are easier to work with .",
    "whitelock et al . ( 2008 ) discuss the galactic calibration of the pl(@xmath4 ) relation and show that it is consistent with the lmc relation .",
    "rejkuba ( 2004 ) demonstrated that the pl(@xmath4 ) relation for o - rich miras in the lmc also fitted similar stars in ngc5128 .",
    "this , together with recent work on miras in dwarf spheroidals and ngc6822 ( see below ) is consistent with the same pl relation applying everywhere .",
    "it remains possible that there are metallicity effects , but these are unlikely to be significantly greater than 0.1 mag for stars from populations considered so far ( see matsunaga 2012 ) .    )",
    "relation for the miras in the dwarf spheroidals , coded as follows : fornax ( cyan ) , leo  i ( magenta ) , sculptor ( green ) , phoenix ( black ) .",
    "the line is at the slope of the lmc pl relation and assumes a distance modulus to the lmc of 18.39 mag ( changing this distance modulus will not alter the loci of the points and the line , only their place relative to the magnitude scale).,width=326 ]",
    "for most purposes at the present time it is preferable to work with the pl(@xmath4 ) relation , primarily because the @xmath4 magnitude is easy to measure , the pulsation amplitude at @xmath4 is lower than at shorter wavelengths and @xmath4 is not often severely affected by circumstellar emission or absorption .",
    "however , pulsation drives mass loss , and there are miras with thick shells and severe circumstellar reddening .",
    "this is particularly true of the very long - period o - rich miras , known as oh / ir stars , but it is also the case for a variety of c - rich stars .    in principle",
    "using bolometric magnitudes avoids the problem with circumstellar extinction and there are three related ways of deriving such magnitudes , all of which have drawbacks :    1 .   ideally , one obtains bolometric magnitudes derived from multi - epoch measurements across a wide wavelength range extending at least into the mid - infrared regime .",
    "such data are rarely available for many stars .",
    "an alternative approach uses well - calibrated colour - dependent ( e.g. , @xmath10 ) bolometric corrections , derived for stars that are similar to those of interest , and for which multi - wavelength observations are available .",
    "a potential problem is that the observed colour is a combination of the intrinsic colour of the star and the reddening .",
    "the same @xmath11 colour can be due to different combinations of these two effects .",
    "thus , @xmath11 may not necessarily be uniquely related to the true bolometric correction .",
    "it is sometimes possible to make a correction for the circumstellar reddening ( e.g. , matsunaga et al . 2009 ) , which is similar to applying a colour - dependent bolometric correction .",
    "the weakness of this is that it requires adoption of an intrinsic colour for the star and we have little evidence of the way this colour correlates with period , particularly for long - period stars , almost all of which have shells .",
    "of course , non - uniform shells , which are the obvious consequence of non - uniform mass loss , present obvious problems to any method for estimating the bolometric magnitude .",
    "different methods of calculating the bolometric magnitude give very significantly different results .",
    "for example , groenewegen et al . ( 2007 ) and kamath et al . (",
    "2010 ) derive bolometric magnitudes for several pulsating stars in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) cluster ngc419 using slightly different @xmath12 values but the same _ spitzer _ data .",
    "their bolometric magnitudes differ by amounts that range from @xmath13 to 0.4 mag for the same star ( see also kerschbaum et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "noting the challenge of determining accurate bolometric magnitudes , estimated values can still provide useful distances , provided a very systematic approach is followed . in practice , this means determining the bolometric magnitude of the star for which the distance is required in _ exactly _ the same way as for the calibrators used to define the pl relation .",
    "matsunaga ( 2006 ) discovered a mira variable , v1 , in lyng  7 ( an old , metal - rich galactic bulge cluster ) with a period of 551 days , a large amplitude , @xmath14 mag , and red colour , @xmath15 mag .",
    "sloan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) showed , based on a _",
    "spectrum , that it is carbon - rich and feast et al .",
    "( 2012a ) used a spectrum from the southern african large telescope ( _ salt _ ) to demonstrate that v1 is a radial - velocity member of the cluster .    assuming a distance modulus of 14.55 mag ( sarajedini et al .",
    "2007 ) , this mira has @xmath16 mag , in agreement with the pl - relation value of @xmath17 mag .",
    "such a luminous star must have had an initial mass @xmath18 and can not be a normal member of the cluster .",
    "it therefore must have formed from a stellar merger .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first ever demonstration of a star that was produced by the merger of two others , but that nevertheless obeys a pl relation .",
    "it is an interesting result and we might well expect there to be remnants of other mergers in the dense environment of the galactic bulge .",
    "a group of us from south africa and japan have used the infrared survey facility ( _ irsf _ ) at the south african astronomical observatory to survey a variety of local group galaxies for agb variables .",
    "the several - year survey uses observations made with the _ sirius _ camera , which simultaneously gives @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 photometry over a @xmath22 arcmin@xmath23 field .",
    "results so far have been published for a total of 17 miras from fornax , leo  i , sculptor and phoenix ( menzies et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 , 2011 ; whitelock et al .",
    "where spectral types are available for these stars , they show them to be c - rich and we assume that they are all c - type stars .",
    "1 shows the absolute @xmath4 magnitudes on a pl(@xmath4 ) relation for all the miras in dwarf spheroidals .",
    "the large scatter is very striking and the distance below the lmc s pl(@xmath4 ) relation is a function of the @xmath11 colour , indicating that the stars below the line are there because of their thick circumstellar shells .",
    "bolometric magnitudes can be estimated using a @xmath11-dependent bolometric correction ( whitelock et al .",
    "2009 ) and the results are shown in a pl relation in fig .  2 .",
    "the scatter is vastly reduced , although there are still two stars which lie well below the mean relation .",
    "two possible explanations have been offered for these faint points .",
    "it may be that the bolometric correction does not apply to these intrinsically relatively blue , short - period , stars ( see point [ _ b _ ] in sect .",
    "3 ) , since it was derived for significantly longer - period stars . alternatively",
    ", they are undergoing obscuration events of the type that are common among c - rich miras in the galaxy and the lmc ( e.g. , whitelock et al .",
    "2006 ) and have non - uniform shells .",
    "ngc6822 is an isolated barred dwarf galaxy , similar to the smc , but with slightly higher metallicity .",
    "it has been examined for agb variables in the same way as the dwarf spheroidals over 3.5 years and has had numerous miras catalogued ( whitelock et al .",
    "2012 ; see also battinelli & demers 2011 ) .",
    "3 shows the variables in a colour  magnitude diagram .",
    "spectral types are available for only very few stars and the split into o- and c - rich assumes that all very red stars are c - rich .",
    "several of the large - amplitude stars without measured periods are probably also miras and all very red stars are variable .    )",
    "relation for ngc6822 showing o - rich ( open circles ) and c - rich miras .",
    "the line has the slope of the lmc pl(@xmath4 ) relation and has been fit to the four short - period o - rich miras .",
    ", width=326 ]    fig .",
    "4 shows the ngc6822 miras on a pl(@xmath4 ) relation .",
    "most of the longer - period o - rich stars fall above the pl relation and are probably similar to the stars in the lmc ( mentioned above ) that may be hot - bottom burning ( whitelock et al .",
    "feast ( 2009 ) suggested that these stars may be pulsating in the first overtone .",
    "many of the c - rich miras fall well below the line as the result of thick circumstellar shells .",
    "5 shows the same stars on a bolometric pl relation , and we see that the c stars scatter around a relation that is very similar to the one obeyed by lmc miras .",
    "the slope is almost identical to the slope of the lmc line , within the uncertainties .    using an lmc distance modulus of 18.5 mag , we determine from the c - rich miras that @xmath24 mag for ngc6822 .",
    "this may be compared to @xmath25 mag derived from cepheid variables ( feast et al .",
    "2012b ) and @xmath26 mag from rr lyrae variables ( clementini et al . 2003 ) .",
    "note that all errors quoted here are internal , but there are systematic uncertainties in all of the measurements .",
    "the agreement is reasonable and certainly shows that miras offer a viable alternative to the more conventional distance indicators .",
    "however , i should note that there remain challenges in using miras as distance indicators .",
    "one of the most serious of these is ensuring that measurements made with different photometric systems give the same result .",
    "battinelli & demers ( 2011 ) have 16 large - amplitude variables in common with whitelock et al .",
    "( 2012 ) in ngc6822 .",
    "the periods determined for these agree well , but the mean magnitudes differ by @xmath27 mag .",
    "both groups know that their photometry of normal stars , i.e. , those with @xmath28 mag , is on the 2mass system .",
    "dealing with very red stars , of which there are no non - variable examples , will require considerably more effort",
    ".    it also remains possible that we will find metallicity effects as the pl relationships become better defined .",
    "cepheids have long provided a vital step on the distance - scale ladder linking the galaxy to distant supernovae . however , mira variables offer a viable alternative which may well be preferable for the following reasons :    * miras are of comparable brightness to cepheids at @xmath4 and brighter at longer wavelengths ( see table  1 and whitelock 2012 ) . *",
    "miras are found in galaxies which do not host cepheids , such as dwarf spheroidals , and will be found in ellipticals . *",
    "miras are found in the haloes of spiral galaxies , where they may be less confused , and therefore more easily observable at large distances , than stars in the spiral arms . *",
    "miras are best observed in the infrared and are therefore not severely affected by interstellar extinction . *",
    "the next generation of space telescopes , as well as large ground - based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics , will primarily work in the infrared .",
    "they will be ideally suited to observing distant mira variables .",
