    "mobile users are evolving : while in the recent past people used their mobile devices just for `` simple '' tasks such as checking e - mail or browsing the web , the rise of novel social applications fosters a massive use of ubiquitous services .",
    "current operating systems for mobile devices ( e.g. ,  android , ios ) allow the execution of applications that , for instance , publish user s geographical position and other context - aware information on social networking services .",
    "however , these forms of interaction are usually based on the classic client - server approach , i.e. ,  the mobile device connects to a central service through its own internet connection .",
    "the proliferation of heterogeneous devices with different capabilities ( computation , communication , data storage , sensors and actuators ) gives rise to new scenarios that promote the cooperation among individuals in order to guarantee the provision of `` always on '' services  @xcite .",
    "as an example , consider a medical doctor who receives an urgent call while attending a meeting with other colleagues .",
    "he needs to check some medical data to diagnose a particular illness ; unfortunately , the tablet pc he carried with him has not enough memory and computational power to execute the job .",
    "therefore , he `` rents '' cpu power from one of his colleagues high - end laptop to carry on the analysis .    as another example , consider a user that wants to upload some pictures made with her smart - phone / camera on flickr or on the wall of her social web application , but she is not provided with network connectivity . hence she exploits the 3 g mobile connection of a neighboring friend using that as a gateway to the net via an ad - hoc short range connection ( e.g. ,  bluetooth ) .    in general , mobile users",
    "have many different devices in their pockets and suitcase , each of them with specific hardware and software characteristics . quite often such devices are not enabled for seamless interaction with other devices belonging to the same owner ; sharing resources among different people is even more challenging . the possibility for a user to exploit , in a   and altruistic way",
    ", computing facilities owned by ( known and trusted ) neighbors requires mechanisms for automatic service discovery and negotiation , and for access control .",
    "a system architecture supporting the scenarios above has been recently proposed  @xcite .",
    "each mobile user is considered as a `` digital organism '' ( do ) , composed by many different devices belonging to the same human being .",
    "each do may share resources with peer dos using auto - configuration strategies . then",
    ", a community of interacting dos can be thought of as a `` digital ecosystem '' .",
    "each do in the ecosystem contributes by providing its own unused resources to its ( friend / trusted ) neighbors .",
    "therefore , the community of dos exploits self - organization protocols and   strategies to create a cooperating , altruistic ecosystem .    of course , privacy and security issues should be carefully considered , especially if data are to be distributed to other users .",
    "addressing these issues in a mobile environment is highly nontrivial , especially when the remote nodes are completely untrusted .",
    "therefore , we assume that each do will preferably connect to other dos towards which there is explicit trust ( e.g. , because users know each other ) .",
    "for example , a user traveling by train shall be willing to share a network connection with some ( known and trusted ) traveling companions .    in this paper",
    "we address the problem of optimizing the allocation of resources in a digital ecosystem , by matching resource requests and offers .",
    "we consider a   overlay which connects dos ; each do may offer and/or require resources , which are traded with neighboring dos .",
    "we present a fully distributed scheme that can match demands and offers , allowing resources to be provisioned efficiently and fairly . we use a market - based approach in which requests are handled through ascending clock auctions  @xcite .",
    "we assume that each do can use some form of `` virtual currency '' ( tokens ) as a form of payment for resources usage : this allows a fair allocation that balances supply and demand  @xcite .",
    "first , we describe a distributed algorithm to carry on the auction ; then , we formulate the resource allocation problem as a   optimization problem , which is used to compute the maximum number of requests that can be matched .",
    "we compare the optimal allocation with the one provided by our our cheap , local strategy .",
    "results show that our approach produces good allocations and requires low computational cost : this makes the auction - based allocation strategy particularly appropriate for sharing resources among devices with very limited computational power .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : formulation ] we give a precise formulation of the problem we are addressing .",
    "section  [ sec : auction ] presents our auction - based resource allocation scheme . in section  [ sec : exp ] we discuss numerical results obtained from a set of synthetic simulation experiments . in section  [ sec : related ] we revise the literature and contrast our approach with some related work . finally , concluding remarks are provided in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "additional details on the auction algorithm , and the   formulation of the optimization problem , are given in the appendix .",
    "we consider a set @xmath0 of @xmath1 different resource types ( e.g. , network connectivity , processing power , storage , and so on ) .",
    "@xmath2 denotes a set of @xmath3 users trading these resources : each user can be either a _ buyer _ ( if he requests resources ) or a _ seller _ ( if he offers resources ) . the same user may play the role of buyer and seller at the same time , offering surplus resources while buying those he needs .    for each user @xmath4 ,",
    "we denote with @xmath5 the amount of type @xmath6 resource requested by @xmath7 ; for each @xmath8 , we denote with @xmath9 the amount of type @xmath6 resource offered by @xmath10 ; quantities are not restricted to be integer .",
    "the vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 are called _ _ resource bundles _ _ as a shortcut to denote a slice of a multi - dimensional vector ; therefore , @xmath11 denotes the slice @xmath13 .    as an example , if there are two resource types ( `` cpu '' and `` network bandwidth '' ) , then a resource bundle @xmath14 can be interpreted as a request ( or an offer ) for @xmath15 mips of cpu power and @xmath16 @xmath17 of network bandwidth .",
    "unit of measures will be omitted in the following .",
    "we assume that each user ( node ) is equipped with some form of wireless connectivity which enables short range interaction with a set of neighbors using an ad - hoc network topology .",
    "we model this with an @xmath18 adjacency matrix @xmath19 , where users @xmath7 and @xmath10 can interact iff @xmath20 ; matrix @xmath19 is symmetric , so that interactions are always bidirectional .",
    "each user can get resources from , or provide resources to , one of his direct neighbors ; multi - hop interactions are not allowed .",
    "multi - hop interactions would be much harder to handle , since appropriate routing strategies should be employed to ensure connectivity in spite of individual users moving and losing contact with neighbors .",
    "we introduce the binary decision variable @xmath21 which equals @xmath22 iff user @xmath7 obtains resource @xmath6 from user @xmath10 . if @xmath23 , then @xmath7 must obtain exactly @xmath5 items of resource @xmath6 from @xmath10 .",
    "the allocation @xmath21 must satisfy the following constraints :    1 .",
    "each buyer @xmath7 must obtain the requested quantities @xmath5 of all resources @xmath6 in his bundle , or none at all .",
    "partially fulfilled requests are not allowed .",
    "2 .   for each @xmath6",
    ", the requested quantity @xmath5 must be provided by a single seller @xmath10 ( if the request is satisfied at all ) .",
    "3 .   for each @xmath6",
    ", the offered quantity @xmath9 can be fractioned across multiple buyers ( i.e. , a seller is not forced to provide all items of resource @xmath6 to a single buyer ) .",
    "4 .   if user @xmath7 gets resource @xmath6 from @xmath10 , then the amount requested by @xmath7 must not exceed the amount offered by @xmath10 : @xmath24 .",
    "5 .   for all @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where the left - hand side represents the total amount of resource @xmath6 provided by seller @xmath10 .",
    "this means that the total amount of resource @xmath6 provided by @xmath10 to all buyers must not exceed his capacity .",
    "@xmath21 can be @xmath22 only if @xmath27 : interactions are only allowed between neighbors .",
    ".notation used in this paper [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     , @xmath28    the raw data is shown in table  [ tab : densities ] . as the connection density increases ,",
    "each buyer can interact with more sellers , since each node has more neighbors .",
    "therefore , we expect that the total number of matches increases because a buyer has more chances to find a seller with enough resources to match his demand .",
    "as we can see from figure  [ fig : hist_densities ] , the maximum number of matches indeed increases as @xmath29 becomes larger .",
    "however , the total number of matches obtained from the auction has a maximum at about @xmath30 $ ] , and starts decreasing afterwards .",
    "the bad behavior of the auction - based allocation can be explained by the fact that for large values of @xmath29 , many buyers are likely to share the same neighboring sellers .",
    "therefore , many buyers are likely also to share with other buyers the seller offering the lowest price : given that all buyers will bid the best ( lowest ) price , this will cause contention to the `` best '' seller .        to substantiate this claim , we show in figure  [ fig : prices ] the average price for a single resource item , and the average number of rounds which are necessary for the auction to settle to the final prices .",
    "we observe that both the average resource price and the number of rounds increases as the connection density @xmath29 becomes larger . for @xmath31 ,",
    "about 60 rounds are requested to conclude the auctions , resulting in higher unitary prices on average .",
    "several strategies can be used to mitigate the problem below : raising the prices by a quantity proportional to the excess demand or adding randomization in the choice of sellers ( such that a buyer may occasionally bid to sub - optimal sellers ) are possible extensions which are currently under investigation .",
    "however , we remark that large connection densities are somewhat unlikely in the scenario we are considering , as it would require a large number of people sharing resources within a limited area . and",
    "furthermore , in such environments short - range communication technologies are preferred for their transmission power efficiency .",
    "the development of interaction mechanisms among wireless devices is a well studied area .",
    "for instance , the project `` seamless computing ''  @xcite proposed by microsoft in 2003 , and jini , which is a part of the java technology originally developed by sun microsystems , have addressed issues related to the definition and implementation of ubiquitous computing paradigms .",
    "today , the notion of `` digital ecosystem '' is generally used to refer to any distributed system with properties of adaptability , self - organization , scalability and sustainability  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use this term in a slightly different acceptation , since we give more emphasis to issues concerned with mobile networks and interaction among constrained devices  @xcite .",
    "according to our view , there are two kinds of problems which need to be considered .",
    "the first one refers to the distributed resource utilization . in this sense ,",
    "several works related to resource discovery , allocation and organization ( mostly in ad - hoc fashion ) are available in the literature , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "another main problem is concerned with optimizing the communication capabilities of a do . in general , this issue turns to allow a mobile node , having multiple wireless network interfaces , to change network points of attachment ( handover ) without disrupting existing connections , combined with the ability to disseminate messages in multi - hop transmissions ( i.e. ,  communication in a manet ) .",
    "examples of works on seamless host mobility are  @xcite    as to the use of auctioning systems to allocate discrete computational resources , works have been already proposed , but usually employed on different use case scenarios , such as cluster and classic distributed systems  @xcite .",
    "other works employ auction - based mechanisms in wireless networks ; however , usually these are schemes that allow users to dynamically negotiate their agreed service levels with their service provider  @xcite , to define an optimal channel allocation or for scheduling .",
    "hence , it is something very different from the   dynamic resource allocation we are considering in this work .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , auction mechanisms are proposed to distributively coordinate and determine which nodes in a wireless network must act as relay nodes .",
    "in this paper we presented a fully distributed algorithm for resource allocation between dos .",
    "our algorithm is based on ascending clock auctions , and allows users to trade resources in exchange for some form of digital currency .",
    "numerical results show that this approach represents a viable and effective strategy promoting sharing of resources , thus providing dos with the means to form an altruistic digital ecosystem .    as concerns the general deployment of the proposed scheme in a real distributed system , there are some open problems that require further investigation .",
    "security issues are particularly important : for instance , authentication must be enforced in order to verify the identity of users that try to utilize resources of other dos .",
    "we will also consider more general notations to describe requests for resources , e.g. , resource bundles as intervals rather than single values .",
