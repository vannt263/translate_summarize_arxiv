    "it is well known that external electric , magnetic or light fields may produce deformations of liquid crystal ( lc ) orientational structures initially stabilized by anisotropic boundary surfaces ( substrates ) .",
    "there is a variety of related fredericksz - type effects that are at the heart of operation of the vast majority of modern liquid crystal devices  @xcite .    among the key factors that have a profound effect on behavior of the field induced orientational transitions are the boundary conditions at the substrates .",
    "these conditions are determined by the anchoring characteristics such as the anchoring energy strengths and the _ easy axis _ , @xmath3 , giving the direction of preferential orientation of lc molecules at the surface .",
    "in contrast to the traditional description of fredericksz - type transitions , it turned out that reorientation processes induced by external fields may additionally involve slow rotation of the easy axis . over the past few decades this slow motion",
    "  the so - called _ easy axis gliding _    has received much attention as a widespread phenomenon observed in a variety of liquid crystals on amorphous glass  @xcite , polymer  @xcite and solid  @xcite substrates .",
    "slow reorientation of the easy axis also takes place on the photosensitive layers prepared using the photoalignment ( pa ) technique .",
    "these include poly-(vinyl)-alcohol ( pva ) coatings with embedded azo - dye molecules  @xcite , polymer compound poly ( vinyl methoxycinnamate )  @xcite , and the azo - dye films  @xcite .",
    "the pa technique is employed in the manufacturing process of liquid crystal displays for fabricating high quality aligning substrates and uses linearly polarized ultraviolet ( lpuv ) light to induce anisotropy of the angular distribution of molecules in azo - dye containing photosensitive films  @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the easy axis is determined by the polarization azimuth of the pumping lpuv light , whereas the azimuthal and polar anchoring strengths may depend on a number of the governing parameters such as the wavelength and the irradiation dose  @xcite .",
    "so , in a lc cell with the initially irradiated layer , subsequent illumination with reorienting light which polarization differs from the one used to prepare the layer can trigger the light - induced easy axis gliding .",
    "such gliding may be of considerable interest for applications such as lc rewritable devices  @xcite and the effects of the _ polarization azimuth _",
    ", @xmath0 , that characterizes orientation of the polarization vector of reorienting lpuv light , @xmath4 will be of our primary concern .    more specifically",
    ", we consider how the polarization azimuth affects the reorientational dynamics of the electrically assisted light - induced azimuthal gliding of the easy axis that takes place on photoaligned azo - dye layers when irradiation of nematic lc ( nlc ) cells with lpuv light is combined with the application of ac in - plane electric field  @xcite . it was observed that , at certain combinations of the parameters such as the amplitude of electric field @xmath5 , the light intensity , @xmath6 , the exposure time , @xmath7 , and the doze of the initial uv irradiation , @xmath8 , the switching off relaxation considerably slows down up to few months .",
    "the switching on dynamics of the gliding for both the linearly polarized and the nonpolarized reorienting light was studied in  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the results of the papers  @xcite demonstrate that the combined effect may be used as a tool to tune technical parameters of lc memory devices .",
    "so , as compared to the case of purely light - induced reorientation of the easy axis governed by the effect of photoinduced ordering in azo - dye layers , the dynamics of the electrically assisted light - induced gliding can be additionally influenced by the electric field , @xmath5 .    in previous studies",
    "@xcite , the reorienting light was linearly polarized along the initial easy axis . in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to study how the polarization azimuth influences the surface mediated reorientation processes that occur in nlc cells under the combined action of lpuv light and in - plane electric field .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : torque ] , we formulate our phenomenological torque balance model of electrically assisted photoinduced easy axis reorientation that takes into account the effects due to the polarization azimuth .",
    "then , for the dynamical system representing the model , the regime of photosaturation is studied by analyzing the bifurcations of equilibria at different values of the polarization azimuth .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] , after short description of the experimental procedure used to measure the azimuthal easy axis angle as a function of irradiation time , the theoretical curves computed from the model are compared with the experimental data measured at various values of the polarization azimuth .    finally , in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusion ] we discuss the results and make some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we carry out a theoretical investigation into the effects of the reorienting light polarization by using a generalized version of the phenomenological model formulated in refs .",
    "@xcite to describe the effect of electrically assisted light - induced azimuthal gliding .",
    "according to this model , the anchoring characteristics of the photoaligned layer such as the easy axis , @xmath9 , are determined by orientational order of lc molecules adsorbed by the azo - dye film .    initially , after pa treatment made before the cell is filled with lc , ordering of the adsorbed molecules is dictated by the orientational order parameter of the azo dye layer induced by the initial irradiation with linearly polarized uv light , @xmath10 .",
    "the initial direction of preferential orientation at the surface @xmath11 is typically normal to the principal axis of the photoinduced anisotropy defined by the polarization vector @xmath10 .    when the cell filled with lc is subsequently irradiated by the linearly polarized reorienting light @xmath12 with the polarization azimuth which differs from the one used at the preparation stage for pa treatment of the azo - dye layer , absorbed lc molecules undergo light - induced transitions .",
    "these transitions occur due to reorientation of azo - dye molecules interacting with the adsorbed lc layer .",
    "thus this is the dynamics of photoinduced reordering of azo - dye molecules that underlies the effect of the reorienting light on the anchoring properties of the photoaligned layer  @xcite .",
    "the easy axis can also be influenced by applying an in - plane electric field @xmath13 in the direction perpendicular to @xmath11 .",
    "this can be explained in terms of adsorption - desorption processes taking place in the near - surface layer .",
    "initially , in the absence of electric field , the surface director @xmath14 characterizing average orientation of lc molecules in the near - surface layer is directed along the easy axis @xmath11 .",
    "so , the adsorption - desorption processes do not influence the undisturbed angular distributions of lc molecules in the absorbed and near - surface layers which are initially identical .    an electric field @xmath13 produces a twist deformation on the distance @xmath15 defined as the _ electric coherence length _",
    ": @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the electric permittivity anisotropy , @xmath18 is the effective frank elastic constant for the twist deformation . at @xmath19 , under this electric - field - induced deformation , the surface director , @xmath14 , inclines towards the electric field @xmath20 .",
    "the absorption - desorption processes involving exchange of molecules between the differently aligned ( absorbed and near - surface ) layers will result in reorientation of absorbed molecules .",
    "note that , owing to low probability of adsorption - desorption events , noticeable changes may require very long periods of time .    in the phenomenological model",

    "for the surface director @xmath14 with the azimuthal angle @xmath23 , the analogues balance involves the torque arising due to deviation of the surface director from the easy axes ( it is proportional to the surface anchoring energy strength @xmath24 ) , the torque transmitted from the bulk and the viscous torque proportional to the _ surface viscosity _ @xmath25 .    the resulting system of balance torque equations for the easy axis and surface director azimuthal angles",

    "an important additional parameter is the phase shift @xmath30 that enters the second term on the right - hand side of eq .   and depends on the polarization azimuth of the reorienting light . in the field - free regime with @xmath31 and @xmath32 ,",

    "interestingly , in our recent paper  @xcite , it was shown that , under certain assumptions , equation   can be derived from the diffusion model of photoinduced reordering in azo - dye films . in this case , it turned out that the phase shift @xmath30 equals the angle between the polarization vector of the reorienting light , @xmath12 , and the axis directed along the normal to @xmath40 .",

    "+      before making comparison between the model and experiment , we shall dwell briefly on the general properties of the dynamical system   which can be conveniently recast into the following dimensionless form :    [ eq : torq - system ] @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the characteristic time of easy axis reorientation ; @xmath45 is the viscosity ratio ; @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the dimensionless anchoring parameters .",
    "the two symmetry relations    [ eq : torq - symm ] @xmath48    describe how the system   transforms when the phase shift is translated by @xmath49 ( the polarization vector is rotated by @xmath49 around the @xmath50 axis which is normal to the layer ) and the phase shift changes its sign ( the polarization vector is reflected with respect to the @xmath51 axis ) .",

    "equations for the stationary solutions of the system   can be written in the following form : @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the indices numbering four different branches of the stationary states .",

    "we now pass on to the stability analysis of the stationary states . following the standard approach  @xcite ,",
    "the criteria of linearized stability are formulated in terms of the linearization matrix of the system  , in the neighborhood of the fixed point @xmath69 @xmath70 so that , in the case of two - dimensional systems , the stability conditions are given by @xmath71 the expression for the matrix @xmath72 evaluated for the branch of stationary points @xmath64 @xmath73 can be derived with the help of equations  .",

    "the light propagating along the normal to the substrates ( the @xmath50 axis ) was selected by an interference filter .",

    "<S> the phenomenological torque balance model previously introduced to describe the electrically assisted light - induced gliding is generalized to study the reorientation dynamics of the nematic liquid crystal easy axis at photoaligned azo - dye films under the combined action of in - plane electric field and reorienting uv light linearly polarized at varying polarization azimuth , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we systematically examine the general properties of the torque balance model by performing analysis of the bifurcations of equilibria at different values of the polarization azimuth and apply the model to interpret the experimental results . in our experiments , it is found that , in contrast to the case where @xmath1 and the light polarization vector is parallel to the initial easy axis , at @xmath2 , the pronounced purely photoinduced reorientation is observed outside the interelectrode gaps . </S>",
    "<S> it is also observed that , in the regions between electrodes with non - zero electric field , the dynamics of reorientation slows down with @xmath0 and the sense of easy axis rotation is independent of the sign of @xmath0 . </S>"
