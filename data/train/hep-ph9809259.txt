    ", the top - squark ( stop ) eigenstate @xmath8 is expected to be the lightest particle @xcite .",
    "stop and gaugino pair production are therefore among the most promising reactions for supersymmetric particle searches at the tevatron and will be focussed upon in the following .",
    "at hadron colliders , the lowest order qcd processes for the production of @xmath8 pairs are quark  antiquark annihilation and gluon  gluon fusion @xmath9 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stop - diag ] .",
    "= 17.cm = 12.cm    the hadronic @xmath10 cross sections are obtained by folding the partonic cross sections with the @xmath11 and @xmath12 luminosities . at the tevatron",

    "the fraction of @xmath11 initiated events rises from 50 to 80% , if the @xmath8 mass is increased from 100 to 200  gev . at the lhc",
    "the gluon - fusion mechanism plays a more prominent role . for a @xmath8 mass below 200  gev , more than 90% of the events",
    "are generated by @xmath12 fusion .",
    "the lowest order cross section depends strongly on the renormalization and factorization scales . as a result ,",
    "the theoretical predictions are uncertain within factors of two . including the susy - qcd corrections @xcite , this scale dependence is reduced significantly , as shown in fig .",

    "the relatively large mass dependence of the @xmath15 factor for @xmath17 production at the tevatron can therefore be attributed to the fact that the @xmath12 initial state is important for small @xmath18 , whereas the @xmath11 initial state dominates for large @xmath18 .",
    "= 7.0 cm = 7.8 cm    the cross section for @xmath8-pair production depends essentially only on the stop mass @xmath18 . the dependence of the cross section on the other susy parameters , _",

    "the squark and gluino contributions in virtual loops are essentially decoupled for canonical susy masses and the general behaviour of the higher - order corrections is determined by ordinary qcd gluon radiation .",
    "bounds on the @xmath17 production cross section can therefore easily be translated into lower bounds on the lightest stop mass without reference to other supersymmetric parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "if stop particles were to be discovered , the cross section can be exploited directly to determine the stop mass @xmath18 .",
    "the impact of the susy - qcd corrections on the experimental mass bounds for @xmath8 will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : mass - bounds ] .",
    "in many supersymmetric models , the light neutralinos and charginos are significantly lighter than squarks or gluinos , and may therefore be the only supersymmetric particles directly accessible at the tevatron . because of the low sm background , the production of @xmath19 followed by the decays @xmath20 and @xmath21 is one of the gold - plated trilepton susy signatures at colliders .",
