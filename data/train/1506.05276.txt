    "the human brain is very skilled at detecting patterns and recognising order in a structure , and ordered structures permeate cultural achievements of human civilisations , be it in the arts , architecture or music .",
    "the ability to detect and describe patterns is also at the basis of all scientific enquiry ; see mumford & desolneux ( 2010 ) for more on pattern theory .",
    "it may thus be surprising that a concept as fundamental as _ order _ does not have any well - defined precise meaning , and that it appears to be rather challenging to come up with a proper definition of what constitutes order in a structure . as a consequence",
    ", there currently is no satisfactory measure to quantify order in any given spatial structure .",
    "there are two common approaches to tackle this issue .",
    "one is to employ diffraction , which effectively measures two - point correlations in the structure ; see cowley ( 1995 ) for background . for kinematic diffraction , in the far - field approximation , the diffraction measure is the fourier transform of the autocorrelation ( or patterson ) function .",
    "diffraction is the approach taken to characterise crystalline materials .",
    "the current definition of a crystal , which is based on its diffraction , derives from a definition which first appeared in the terms of reference of the iucr commission on aperiodic crystals , published in the 1991 report of the iucr executive committee ( international union of crystallography , 1992 , p.  928 ) ; in fact , it is less general than what the commission proposed .",
    "the following quotes the more specific definition given in authier and chapuis ( 2014 ) , and used in the iucr online dictionary of crystallography .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a material is a crystal if it has * essentially * a sharp diffraction pattern .",
    "the word * essentially * means that most of the intensity of the diffraction is concentrated in relatively sharp * bragg peaks * , besides the always present diffuse scattering . in all cases ,",
    "the positions of the diffraction peaks can be expressed by @xmath0 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the basis vectors of the reciprocal lattice and integer coefficients respectively and the number @xmath3 is the minimum for which the positions of the peaks can be described with integer coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "the conventional crystals are a special class , though very large , for which @xmath4 .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the prominent role of the word _ essentially _ shows that this is a humble definition , in the sense that it reflects our limited knowledge of the structures we may potentially encounter in nature .",
    "the interpretation given in the definition that ` essentially ' means that most of the intensity is concentrated in bragg peaks means that the integrated contribution from the background must be weak compared to the bragg diffraction , which is rather arbitrary , as any bragg diffraction indicates order . by allowing the integer @xmath3 to be larger than the three space dimensions we live in , aperiodic crystals",
    "are included in this definition , and conventional ( periodic ) crystals have become a special class ( for which @xmath4 ) .",
    "note that @xmath3 is restricted to be _ finite _ here , so this particular form of the definition excludes pure point diffractive systems with non - finitely generated fourier modules ( over integer coefficients ) ; the definition stipulates that bragg peaks in crystals can be indexed by a finite number of integer coefficients .",
    "note that the definition originally proposed in 1991 did not include this restriction ( international union of crystallography , 1992 , p.  928 ) .    because the inverse problem of diffraction is inherently difficult ( bombieri & taylor , 1986 ) and , in general , not unique ( patterson , 1944 )",
    ", we do not have a complete characterisation of structures that show pure point diffraction ( which means that the diffraction consists of bragg peaks only ) , even in the idealised case of an ideal , perfect structure .",
    "neither do we have a good understanding of what structures with an _ essentially _ pure point spectrum may look like .",
    "the second approach , which is particularly suited to stochastic systems , employs the _ entropy _ of a structure .",
    "entropy takes into account the number of different local configurations of a system , and how this number grows with the system size ; normally you are looking at an exponential growth with the system size , and any sub - exponential growth corresponds to zero entropy .",
    "clearly , entropy can distinguish deterministic from random systems , and looking at different forms of scaling behaviour makes it possible to differentiate , at least to some extent , between different degrees of disorder .",
    "however , any deterministic structure has zero entropy ( as has any sufficiently small deviation from it ) , so entropy is a rather crude measure of order .    in this article ,",
    "the current state of knowledge of mathematical diffraction of structures is summarised and discussed in relation with our notion of crystalline order . the current article attempts to present a broad overview only ; for details on calculations and further background , we refer to recent survey articles ( baake & grimm 2011a , baake & grimm 2012 ) and to the monograph by baake & grimm ( 2013 ) , as well as to references therein . using a number of explicit example structures with different types of diffraction spectrum ,",
    "the range of possibilities is explored , contributing to the ongoing discussion on what order means in crystals and beyond ( van enter & mikisz 1992 , lifshitz 2003 , 2007 , 2011 ) .",
    "in 2014 , we were celebrating the international year of crystallography , and were looking back at a century of rapid developments in crystallography since von laue ( friedrich , knipping & von laue 1912 , von laue 1912 ) and father and son bragg ( bragg & bragg 1913 ) first employed x - ray diffraction to analyse the atomic structure of crystalline materials ; see authier ( 2013 ) for a historical account . in the simplest setting , which is suitable in particular for x - ray diffraction , it is sufficient to describe the kinematic scattering of radiation by the sample , and consider the far - field ( fraunhofer ) limit for the outgoing radiation .",
    "the calculation of the diffraction pattern of a given structure then becomes possible by means of harmonic analysis , while the corresponding inverse problem of determining a structure from its pattern of diffraction intensities is , in general , difficult and non - unique , even in this simplified setting .",
    "this section attempts to present a summary of mathematical diffraction theory , highlighting the ideas and the flavour of the approach without going into technicalities , while trying to explain some of the technical terms by means of simple examples and familiar notions ; for mathematical details , the reader is referred to baake & grimm ( 2013 ) .",
    "a mathematically satisfactory approach to describe extended ( infinite ) systems , such as ideal crystals , is provided by using _",
    "measures _ to describe both the distribution of matter in the scattering medium and the distribution of scattered radiation intensity in space . in mathematics , measures are the natural concept to quantify spatial distributions , and are related to the notion of integration . the general approach to measures in mathematics is rather technical , but there is a simpler way to think of measures ( which is due to a result called the riesz - markov representation theorem ; see reed & simon ( 1980 ) for details ) . indeed , it is possible to regard a measure as a linear functional , which is a linear map that associates a number to each function from an appropriate space .",
    "a familiar example is the integral of a function , which is the example we start with .",
    "a well - known and widely used measure in mathematics is _ lebesgue measure _ , which is commonly used in integration of functions on the real numbers @xmath5 .",
    "we denote lebesgue measure by the letter @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath7 is a function on @xmath5 , the lebesgue measure of @xmath8 is @xmath9 where the usual shorthand @xmath10 is used for integration with respect to lebesgue measure .",
    "so lebesgue measure associates to a function @xmath8 a number , which is its integral .",
    "the lebesgue measure of a set @xmath11 , written as @xmath12 , is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the characteristic function ( or indicator function ) of @xmath15 , which takes the value @xmath16 for all @xmath17 , and @xmath18 otherwise .",
    "the lebesgue measure of a set is what we call the volume ( as in this case we are in one dimension , the volume is a length ) ; for instance , the lebesgue measure of the interval @xmath19 $ ] with @xmath20 is @xmath21 ) = b - a$ ] .",
    "lebesgue measure is the unique translation - invariant measure on @xmath5 ( meaning that @xmath22 for any translation @xmath23 ) that assigns the volume @xmath24 to the unit interval @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "lebesgue measure on @xmath5 generalises in the familiar way to @xmath26-dimensional space @xmath27 , corresponding to @xmath26-dimensional ( multiple ) integrals .",
    "for simplicity , we will mainly consider the case @xmath28 in what follows .",
    "another well - known and important measure is the _ dirac measure _ ( or point measure ) at a point @xmath29 , denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "it describes a localised structure at a point @xmath31 in space , with total measure @xmath24 .",
    "this means that , if @xmath8 is a function on @xmath5 , its point measure at @xmath31 is @xmath32 . in the physics literature , the point measure is often written like a function @xmath33 ( which can be considered a generalised function or _",
    "distribution _ obtained as a limit of functions , for instance of a sequence of gaussian functions of integral @xmath24 , centred at the origin , and with a decreasing width , which then become increasingly sharper ) , with the suggestive notation @xmath34 this notation can be used consistently as long as one remembers that dirac s @xmath35 is not a function in the usual sense .",
    "as above , one can also define the point measure of a set @xmath11 , which is @xmath36 , so @xmath37 if @xmath38 and @xmath39 otherwise .",
    "point measures are often used to describe a set of localised scatterers in space . given a set of scatterers located at points in a subset @xmath40 ( which we usually assume to be a _",
    "delone set _ , which means that it neither contains points that are arbitrarily close to each other nor holes of arbitrary size )",
    ", we can associate a measure @xmath41 which we call the _ dirac comb _ ( a term coined by de bruijn ( 1986 ) ; see also crdoba ( 1989 ) ) of @xmath42 .",
    "an example of such a dirac comb is @xmath43 , which is the uniform dirac comb on the integer lattice .    by introducing scattering weights @xmath44 at position @xmath29 ( which in general can be complex numbers , but we will assume to be real for the purpose of this exposition ) , we arrive at a _ weighted dirac comb _ @xmath45 which can serve as a model representing a scattering medium containing different types of scatterers .",
    "any measure of this type , consisting of a ( weighted ) sum of point measures , is called a _ pure point measure _ ( with respect to lebesgue measure ) .",
    "it is possible to include realistic scattering profiles by considering convolutions with appropriate motives , so this approach is not as restrictive as it may seem . a schematic representation of an example , the weighted ( periodic ) dirac comb @xmath46 is shown in figure  [ fig : comb ] .     of eq .",
    "point measures @xmath47 are represented as columns at position @xmath31 of height proportional to their weight @xmath48.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    attaching scattering profiles to a dirac comb is one way to represent a continuous scattering intensity in space . of course",
    ", there is a more direct approach if the scattering intensity is described by a continuous distribution is space . if @xmath49 is a such a continuous ( or , at least , locally integrable ) function on @xmath5 , it defines a measure @xmath50 on @xmath5 via @xmath51 in this case @xmath49 is called the _ density _ of the measure @xmath50 .",
    "any measure @xmath50 that can be written in this form is called an _ absolutely continuous measure _ ( with respect to lebesgue measure ) .",
    "the measures we are interested in are those which describe distributions ( of scatterers or scattering intensity ) in space , and one physical restriction we would like to impose is that any finite region of space can only contain a finite total scattering strength or finite intensity .",
    "the measures that satisfy this property are called _ translation bounded _ measures . a dirac comb @xmath52 of a delone set",
    "@xmath40 is always translation bounded , because there can be only finitely many points in any finite region of space , due to the minimum distance between points .",
    "the same is true for a weighted dirac comb provided that the weight function @xmath44 is bounded .",
    "an examples of a measure that is not translation bounded would be a dirac comb of a point set with an accumulation point , for instance @xmath53 .",
    "for this measure , any interval containing the origin contains infinitely many point measures , and thus has infinite measure .",
    "a central result in measure theory is lebesgue s decomposition theorem .",
    "it states that any measure can be written as a sum of three components in a unique way ( with respect to a reference measure , which is our case will always be lebesgue measure ) .",
    "if @xmath50 is a measure on @xmath5 , the three components are denoted as @xmath54 and are called the _ pure point _",
    "component @xmath55 , the _ singular continuous _ component @xmath56 and the _ absolutely continuous _ component @xmath57 .",
    "we have met typical examples of pure point and absolutely continuous measures above , so the obvious question is what a singular continuous measure looks like .",
    "as it is defined , it is all that is ` left ' if you remove the pure point part ( consisting of a sum of weighted point measures ) and the absolutely continuous part ( which is described by a locally integrable density function )  but this does not really help to gain an understanding of what such a measure represents .",
    "singular continuous measures are rather weird objects indeed ; they do not give weight to any single point in space ( because otherwise it would have a pure point component ) , but are concentrated on sets of vanishing volume ( because otherwise you could describe part of it by a density function ) .     of the corresponding singular continuous measure.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the best - known example of a singular continuous measure is provided by the classic middle - thirds cantor set ; see figure  [ fig : cantor ] .",
    "starting from the unit interval , the cantor set is constructed by removing the middle third of it , then removing the middle thirds of the two resulting intervals , and iterating this procedure _",
    "ad infinitum_. the corresponding cantor measure is constructed by starting from the lebesgue measure on the interval , so we have total measure @xmath24 , and at each step distributing the mass equally onto the constituent intervals .",
    "in the limit , the total measure is thus still @xmath24 , but there is neither any isolated point that carries a finite measure ( since the measure of each interval in the @xmath3th step is @xmath58 , so it vanishes in the limit ) nor any interval of finite length that is in the support of the measure ( meaning that the measure does not vanish on it ) .",
    "the measure constructed in this way is thus singularly continuous , and can be described in terms of a distribution function which is a ` devil s staircase ' .",
    "this function is constant almost everywhere , and displays a hierarchy of plateaux in its graph ( see figure  [ fig : cantor ] ) which reflect the hierarchy of gaps produced by the excision steps in the cantor construction .",
    "this function plays the role of the integrated density for the singular continuous measure .",
    "lebesgue s decomposition provides a rigorous way to separate the diffraction measure of a structure into its pure point ( bragg ) part and its singular and absolutely continuous components .",
    "however , using this as the definition really only makes sense if one works with infinite systems ( because finite systems will always have absolutely continuous diffraction ) .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the definition of a phase transition in materials ( as a discontinuity in a thermodynamic potential ) , which again only applies in the mathematically rigorous sense to an infinite system ( because for finite systems these potentials are smooth functions ) .",
    "nevertheless , these concepts have proved useful for applications to macroscopically large ( albeit finite ) systems .",
    "a key quantity in diffraction theory is the _ autocorrelation _ , which quantifies the two - point correlation of a structure . in crystallography , this is often called the _",
    "patterson function_. if the material is described by a ( real ) density function @xmath49 on @xmath5 ( so we deal with an absolutely continuous distribution ) , the autocorrelation is an absolutely continuous measure whose density is the familiar convolution @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the function defined by @xmath61 .    in the case",
    "that the material is described by a one - dimensional weighted dirac comb @xmath62 of the form given in eq .",
    "( with real weight function @xmath44 ) , the autocorrelation is a pure point measure @xmath63 with non - vanishing contributions only at distances @xmath64 in the difference set @xmath65 ( which you may interpret as the set of interatomic distances ) .",
    "the point masses for interatomic distances @xmath64 are weighted by the _ autocorrelation coefficients _",
    "@xmath66 , which are given by @xmath67 provided that these limits exist .",
    "note that @xmath68 is the length of the interval @xmath69 , so the autocorrelation coefficient @xmath66 is precisely the volume - averaged two - point correlation for the interatomic distance @xmath64 .",
    "using the language of measures , these equations can be neatly summarised as follows .",
    "given a ( translation bounded ) real measure @xmath62 , again for simplicity in one dimension , its _ autocorrelation measure _ @xmath70 is defined as @xmath71 provided the limit exists . here , @xmath72 denotes the restriction of @xmath62 to the interval @xmath69 , and @xmath73 is defined via @xmath74 with @xmath75 as above .",
    "finally , @xmath76 denotes the standard _",
    "convolution _ of measures , which is the appropriate generalisation of the convolution of functions .",
    "the autocorrelation of @xmath62 is thus the volume - averaged convolution @xmath77 ( also called the _ eberlein convolution _ ) of @xmath62 with its ` flipped - over ' version @xmath78 , and thus picks out the two - point correlations in the structure described by @xmath62 .",
    "this approach to mathematical diffraction was pioneered by hof ( 1995 ) .",
    "the _ diffraction measure _ is then the fourier transform @xmath79 of the autocorrelation , so essentially it provides a spectral analysis for the two - point correlations in the original structure .",
    "it is a translation bounded , positive measure , which quantifies how much of the kinematic scattering intensity reaches a given volume in space .",
    "lebesgue s decomposition @xmath80 into its pure point part ( the bragg peaks , of which there are at most countably many ) , its absolutely continuous part ( the diffuse background scattering , described by a locally integrable density function ) and its singular continuous part ( which encompasses anything that remains ) provides a mathematically rigorous definition of the different types of diffraction . for the definition of a crystal",
    "cited above , it is the pure point part @xmath81 that matters  a crystal is a structure where this part represents the majority of the diffracted intensity ( there will always be some continuous diffraction in practice ) , though this alone does not guarantee that the _ positions _ of bragg peaks can be indexed by a finite number of integers .",
    "indeed , there are examples of systems that are pure point diffractive , meaning that @xmath82 , where this is not the case ; we shall meet an example below .",
    "a conventional , periodic crystal is described as a lattice - periodic structure , corresponding to an ideal infinite crystal without defects or surfaces",
    ". a periodic crystal is characterised by its periods ( translations that keep the crystal invariant ) , which form a lattice @xmath83 ( because any linear combinations of periods are also periods ) , and by the distribution of scatterers in a unit cell ( fundamental domain ) of this lattice . here , a lattice @xmath83 in @xmath26-dimensional space ;",
    "see also the examples below . ]",
    "is the set of integer linear combinations of @xmath26 linearly independent basis vectors , so it can be written in the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 , for @xmath86 , are linearly independent vectors in @xmath87 .",
    "familiar examples are the integer lattice @xmath88 in one dimension , the square lattice @xmath89 in two dimensions and the simple ( primitive ) cubic lattice @xmath90 in three dimensions .",
    "if the scattering medium has a ( periodic ) crystal structure described by a lattice @xmath83 , it can always be represented as a measure @xmath91 where @xmath50 can be chosen as a finite measure which describes the decoration of the fundamental domain , while the dirac comb @xmath92 ensures lattice periodicity .",
    "the corresponding autocorrelation measure is a @xmath83-periodic measure that can be calculated from the appropriate generalisation of eq .   as @xmath93 using @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 denotes the density ( per unit volume ) of the lattice @xmath83 .",
    "the diffraction measure @xmath79 is then given by , where @xmath97 denotes the dual ( or reciprocal ) lattice of @xmath83 ; see baake & grimm ( 2013 ) for details . ]",
    "@xmath98 this provides the familiar result for periodic crystals : any perfect periodic crystal with lattice of periods @xmath83 shows pure point diffraction with bragg peaks located on the reciprocal lattice as @xmath99 . due to the factor @xmath100 in the exponent , one avoids the appearance of such factors in the definition of the reciprocal lattice . ] @xmath97 , and the intensity of the bragg peak is determined by the density of the crystal lattice @xmath83 and by the continuous function @xmath101 , which depends on the distribution of scatterers in a fundamental domain of @xmath83 . by expressing the reciprocal lattice positions as linear combinations of basis vectors of the reciprocal lattice @xmath97 , this can be cast in the form of eq .   with @xmath102 .",

    "can equivalently be written as @xmath157 sets of this form are called cut and project sets or model sets .",
    "the condition that @xmath158 selects a discrete subset of the dense set point set @xmath142 , in fact , a very special discrete subset where points are separated either by intervals of length @xmath24 ( for short intervals @xmath159 ) or by intervals of length @xmath144 ( for long intervals @xmath160 ) .",
    "as it turns out , this projection yields the famous fibonacci sequence @xmath161 of long ( @xmath160 ) and short ( @xmath159 ) intervals , which can be generated by the two - letter substitution rule @xmath162 , @xmath163 .",

    "hence the set of left endpoints of short or of long intervals separately are model sets with windows @xmath167 and @xmath168 , respectively , while the set of all left interval endpoints is a model set with window @xmath169 ; compare figure  [ fig : fiboproj ] .     and @xmath132.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "as mentioned above , this construction can be generalised to physical and internal spaces of any dimension . the general _ cut and project scheme _ ( cps ) for euclidean model sets",

    "we assume that the point set @xmath175 , which is the projection of the lattice points into the physical space , is a bijective image of @xmath130 , which means that no two lattice points in @xmath130 project onto the same point in @xmath142 .",
    "in other words , each point in @xmath142 can be ` lifted ' to a unique lattice point in @xmath130 , and the inverse map @xmath176 is well - defined on all elements of @xmath142 .",
    "this ensures that the star - map @xmath177 is well - defined on @xmath142 , so each point in @xmath142 has a unique associate in internal space ; see moody ( 2000 ) for details .",
    "finally , we assume that the corresponding set @xmath178 in internal space is dense .    given a cps ,",
    "the second ingredient in the definition of a cut and project set is the _ window _ ( sometimes also called an acceptance domain ) @xmath179 , which is assumed to be a sufficiently nice subset of @xmath128 ( technically , a relatively compact subset with non - empty interior ) .",
    "a cut and project set is then defined by selecting all points @xmath31 in the projected lattice @xmath142 whose companion @xmath180 in internal space falls inside the window @xmath152 . expressed as an equation , this means that any set of the form @xmath181 or indeed any translate of such a set , is what we call a _ model set_. the technical conditions on the window @xmath152 ensure that @xmath42 is a meyer set ( meyer 1972 , moody 2000 ) , which means that the difference set @xmath182 is uniformly discrete ( so different distances between point in the structure differ by at least a fixed amount ) and that the set @xmath42 is relatively dense ( which means that there are no arbitrarily large ` holes ' in the point set ) . if the boundary @xmath183 of the window @xmath152 is nice in the sense that it has zero volume ( in the sense of lebesgue measure ) , we refer to @xmath42 as a _ regular model set_. the setting of eq .",

    "it is worth mentioning that there are various equivalent ways of interpreting the cut and project construction .",
    "one commonly used approach attaches an inverted copy of the window as a ` target ' to each lattice point , and projected points are then obtained as the intersection of these targets with the physical space ; see figure  [ fig : fibotarget ] for an illustration of the fibonacci case .",
    "albeit equivalent , this description offers a simpler way of interpreting experimental data , and is therefore the preferred presentation of the cut and project approach in experimental research papers , where it is often referred to as the _ section method_. apart from providing an intuitive meaning for the targets as ` atomic surfaces ' , this approach allows for additional variation ( by deformations of the targets ) that can be exploited , for instance in the description of modulated phases . for further variants of the cut and project method ,",
    "the reader is referred to chapter  7.5 in baake & grimm ( 2013 ) .",
    "familiar examples of model sets are some one - dimensional substitution - based structures such as the fibonacci chain discussed above , and some of its generalisations .",
    "planar examples include the penrose tiling and the tbingen triangle tiling with decagonal symmetry , the ammann - beenker tiling with octagonal symmetry and the shield tiling with dodecagonal symmetry , which can all be obtained by projection from four - dimensional lattices .",

    "these examples have direct application to the crystallography of quasicrystals , and serve as models for the structure of decagonal , octagonal , dodecagonal and icosahedral quasicrystals , respectively ; compare steurer & deloudi ( 2009 ) for details .",
    "realisations of model sets with other symmetries , such as planar sevenfold symmetry for instance , have as yet not been observed in nature , and the same is true for model sets where the internal space is not euclidean .",
    "nevertheless , such systems share many properties with the familiar quasicrystalline cases , and should not be excluded _ a priori_.",
    "even if it may prove impossible to realise such structures in self - assembled systems , we may be able to produce these in purpose - made manufactured structures at various length scales , from macroscopic to nanometre and atomic scales .",
    "arguably the most important result in the theory of model sets , in the context of mathematical diffraction theory , is the proof that regular model sets have _ pure point diffraction_. three different approaches have been used to prove this statement .",
    "the first proof using methods of dynamical systems theory was completed by schlottmann ( 2000 ) , employing an argument by dworkin ( 1993 ) and the mathematical diffraction approach of hof ( 1995 ) ; see also lenz & strungaru ( 2009 ) for further developments .",
    "an alternative approach employs the theory of almost periodic measures ( baake & moody 2004 , moody & strungaru 2004 , strungaru 2005 ) .",
    "following a suggestion by lagarias , baake & grimm ( 2013 ) present a proof based on poisson s summation formula for the embedding lattice in conjunction with weyl s lemma on uniform distribution , which exploits the uniform distribution of projected lattice points in internal space .",

    ".   gives the result for euclidean model sets , the only difference for the general case is that the volume ( with respect to lebesgue measure in euclidean space ) is replaced by the suitable invariant measure ( haar measure ) on the locally compact abelian group .",
    "the current definition of crystals thus covers conventional periodic crystals , incommensurate crystals and quasicrystals , and hence all currently known realisations of perfectly ordered structures in nature . while the question asked by bombieri & taylor ( 1986 ) has not yet been satisfactorily answered ,",
    "it is clear that pure point diffraction is a severe constraint on the possible structure ( baake , lenz & richard 1997 ) , and recent results by lenz & moody ( 2009 , 2011 ) indicate that model sets play a major role in a potential abstract parametrisation of the inverse problem . however , there are clearly well - ordered structures that do not possess this property , and this section will discuss a few characteristic examples . but first , we start with an example of a pure point diffractive system with non - finitely generated fourier module , which thus possesses a diffraction pattern where bragg peaks can not be indexed by a finite number of integers .      well - known examples of systems with non - euclidean internal spaces are limit - periodic structures .",

    "we thus can continuously interpolate between the rudin  shapiro chain with entropy @xmath39 and the @xmath301 bernoulli chain with entropy @xmath303 , with all systems sharing the same absolutely continuous diffraction .",
    "it is interesting to note that the rudin  shapiro chain , like the generalised thue ",
    "morse chains above , possesses a ` hidden ' limit - periodic order that is revealed when looking at an appropriate dynamical factor . using the same sliding block map @xmath275 as above , one obtains once more a factor with pure point diffraction spectrum , in this case supported on @xmath305 $ ] , as for the period doubling case ; see baake & grimm ( 2013 ) for details .",
    "clearly , this does not happen for the stochastic chain , which does not have any ` hidden ' order .      an interesting ( and still somewhat mysterious ) class of structures is provided by discrete systems which possess a continuous symmetry . the paradigm for such a structure is the conway ",
    "radin pinwheel tiling ( radin 1994 ) .",
    "it is an inflation tiling based on a single triangular prototile of edge lengths @xmath24 , @xmath230 and @xmath306 together with its reflected version .",
    "the inflation rule is shown in figure  [ fig : pininf ] ; it consists of a linear rescaling by the inflation factor @xmath306 ( first step ) and the dissection of the inflated triangle into five copies of the original prototile ( second step ) , where both orientations occur .",
    "the reflected rule applies to the reflected triangle , and hence the tiling is reflection symmetric .",
    "a realisation of the tiling is shown in figure  [ fig : melb ] .",
    "what makes this inflation rule special is the rotation it introduces between copies of the prototiles .",
    "this rotation by an angle @xmath307 is incommensurate with @xmath137 , and as a result introduces new , independent directions under inflation .",
    "iteration of the inflation rule on an initial patch thus leads to patches comprising an exponentially increasing number of triangles occurring in a linearly growing number of independent directions . in the limit of an infinite tiling",
    ", triangles appear in infinitely many different orientations . while for the familiar cases of penrose - type tilings inflation rules produce tilings with discrete ( in the penrose case decagonal ) symmetry ( in the sense that the tiling space defined by the fixed point tilings has decagonal symmetry ; see baake & grimm ( 2013 ) for details ) , the pinwheel inflation produces a tiling space with complete circular symmetry ( radin 1994 , radin 1997 , moody , postnikoff & strungaru 2006 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "its diffraction is circularly symmetric as well , and hence can not have any pure point component apart from the trivial bragg peak at the origin .",
    "in fact , the rotation is rather special , because it is a coincidence rotation for the planar square lattice , as @xmath308 is rational ; see baake ( 1997 ) for background .",
    "this property is behind the observation that the point set of pinwheel reference points can either be seen as a subset of rotated square lattices or a subset of scaled square lattices , with scaling by inverse powers of @xmath309 ( baake , frettlh & grimm 2007a ) , which makes it possible to draw conclusions on the diffraction spectrum by using a radial version of poisson s summation formula .",
    "this provides evidence that the diffraction consists of sharp rings , and that it is surprisingly similar to a toy model of powder diffraction of square lattice structures ( baake , frettlh & grimm 2007a , 2007b ) .",
    "a diffraction measure supported on sharp rings in the plane is singular continuous , and it is clear that the diffraction of the pinwheel tiling contains singular continuous components of this type ; however , to date there is no complete characterisation of the diffraction spectrum of this example .",
    "results of numerical investigations suggest that an absolutely continuous component may also be present .",
    "an approximation of the radially averaged diffraction is shown in figure  [ fig : pinsq ] .",
    "for the pinwheel diffraction ( black line ) , based on data from a finite system .",
    "the grey columns indicate the sharp rings observed in a toy model of powder diffraction from a planar square - lattice structure , with the relative scale adjusted according to the first main peak ; see baake , frettlh & grimm ( 2007a , 2007b ) for details . ]    while the pinwheel tiling may seem a rather exotic structure , it is generated by a quite simple inflation rule with only a single shape up to congruency .",
    "there are many other structures of this type ; see frettlh ( 2008 ) for some examples .",
    "the examples of the thue  morse and rudin  shapiro systems show that systems can possess ` hidden ' order that does not manifest itself by a pure point component in the diffraction pattern .",
    "however , this order can show up in the dynamical spectrum , which is related to the analysis of the translation action on the structure .",
    "there is a close relationship between these two spectral quantities  indeed , the first proofs of the pure point diffractivity of model sets employed the link to dynamical spectra , using the results that the diffraction spectrum is pure point if and only if the dynamical spectrum is . in general",
    ", however , the dynamical spectrum can be richer ( van enter & mikisz 1992 ) , and the thue  morse and rudin  shapiro systems are examples ; in both cases , the dynamical spectrum contains the pure point component @xmath305 $ ] which arises because both examples stem from primitive substitutions of constant length @xmath230 ( in the rudin ",
    "shapiro case , the underlying substitution employs four different letters , and the binary system is derived from this by identifying pairs of letters ; see baake & grimm ( 2013 ) for details ) .",
    "a particularly simple yet striking example , originally suggested by van enter , is discussed in baake & van enter ( 2011 ) .",
    "it considers the set of certain configurations of @xmath284 on the integer lattice @xmath88 .",
    "the allowed configurations @xmath296 are obtained by partitioning the lattice into pairs of neighbouring points ( there are two ways to do this ) , and then randomly assigning to each pair either the values @xmath310 or @xmath311 . turning a configuration @xmath218 into a signed dirac comb with weights @xmath312 , it is easy to show , by an application of the strong law of large numbers , that the autocorrelation is ( almost surely ) given by @xmath313 .",
    "the corresponding diffraction measure is then @xmath314 and hence purely absolutely continuous , where the radon - nikodym density relative to @xmath6 is written as a function of @xmath192 .",
    "however , the dynamical spectrum of this system contains eigenvalues ( hence a pure point part ) , reflecting the order in the system imposed by the ` dimer ' condition on pairs .",
    "this can be revealed by considering a block map similar to to the map @xmath275 used above .",
    "explicitly , setting @xmath315 for @xmath209 maps @xmath218 to a new sequence @xmath316 , which ( almost surely ) has the diffraction measure @xmath317 see baake & van enter ( 2011 ) for details .",
    "the ` dimer ' structure is reflected in the presence of the pure point part supported on @xmath318 , which also is the entire point part of the dynamical spectrum .",
    "this example again shows that the ` hidden ' order can also be seen in diffraction , but not in the original system .",
    "note that simply changing the weights of the scatterers will not achieve this , although it may contribute a trivial bragg part .",
    "however , choosing a suitable factor ( or a family of factors ) as an image of a continuous map such as the sliding block map @xmath275 used above , makes it possible to detect the ` hidden ' order via its diffraction . that this is a general property of the relation between dynamical and diffraction spectrum",
    "is a recent non - trivial insight ; see baake , lenz & van enter ( 2013 ) for the latest developments in this direction .",
    "the discoveries of incommensurately modulated and aperiodically ordered solids in the twentieth century ( de wolff 1974 , janner & janssen 1977 , shechtman , blech , gratias & cahn 1984 , ishimasa , nissen & fukano 1985 ) have changed our view of crystallography .",
    "crystallography is no longer restricted to the analysis of lattice periodic arrangements of atoms or molecules , but takes a broader view which includes certain aperiodically ordered structures , such as incommensurate crystals and quasicrystals .",
    "the definition of a crystal has been amended to reflect this broader view .",
    "the definition of a crystal is based on the currently known catalogue of periodic and aperiodic crystals .",
    "we presently do not know of any materials that have aperiodically ordered structures beyond incommensurate crystals ( including composite structures ) and quasicrystals .",
    "for the latter , so far only symmetries corresponding to the smallest embedding dimension ( in the sense of model sets ) have been observed , with octogonal , decagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystal planes corresponding to projections from four - dimensional periodic structures , and icosahedral quasicrystals being described by projection from six - dimensional lattices . however , there is no _ a priori _ reason that excludes other symmetries completely , or indeed aperiodically ordered structures that are not described by model sets obtained from projections of a lattice in a finite - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the definition of a crystal also reflects the current lack of understanding of what constitutes order in matter ( and more generally ) , and in this sense should be seen as a working definition that may well need to be revised in the future . in crystallography , order is linked to diffraction , which makes sense because diffraction is the method of choice to experimentally determine the structure of a solid .",
    "the examples discussed above demonstrate that there are ordered structures which are not captured by the current definition , either because their pure point diffraction fails to be finitely generated , or because they do not have any non - trivial point component in their diffraction . while we do not know whether such structures are realised in nature , it should become possible to manufacture such materials with purpose - designed structures and properties . in this sense , these structures are relevant and should be considered to be within the realm of crystallography .    from a mathematical point of view , a more satisfying attempt at defining order might employ the dynamical spectrum , which is a generalisation of the diffraction spectrum .",
    "the results above are in line with the intuition by van enter & mikisz ( 1992 ) that an apparent disorder at an ` atomic ' scale could be accompanied by order at a ` molecular ' scale , with diffraction of derived factor structures probing the latter . while diffraction itself only measures the averaged two - point correlations in a structure , the dynamical spectrum probes the repetitivity of a structure under translations , and hence also higher - order correlations , which generally can distinguish homometric systems ( grnbaum & moore 1995 ) .",
    "while these are not necessarily directly accessible by experiment , the additional information contained in the dynamical spectrum is , in principle , encoded in diffraction spectra of derived systems ; see baake , lenz & van enter ( 2013 ) for recent developments on establishing this connection .",
    "defining order via a non - trivial pure point component of the dynamical spectrum would include structures such as the thue  morse and rudin  shapiro systems , though presumably examples of pinwheel type ( for which the dynamical spectrum is not known ) would be excluded . in this sense , it probably is still not completely satisfactory to capture all possible manifestations of order , but it may provide a first step towards a better understanding .    in this paper ,",
    "the discussion was limited to deterministic systems , apart from the brief excursion on the bernoulli chain .",
    "clearly , moving to partially ordered systems , which contain an element of stochastic disorder , is relevant as well .",
    "not only does even the most perfect crystal contain some amount of disorder , but there are also entropically stabilised structures with intrinsic configurational disorder , among them many quasicrystalline phases . in this context",
    ", the notion of ` entropic order ' is relevant , which has been investigated in statistical physics , in particular with respect to the physics of glasses ; see , for instance , kurchan & levine ( 2011 ) , sasa ( 2012a , 2012b ) and wolff & levine ( 2014 ) for recent work along these lines .",
    "although the importance of random tiling structures was pointed out early on ( elser 1985 ) , and while there is some good heuristic information from scaling considerations ( henley 1999 ) , there are as yet very few mathematically rigorous results for non - trivial random tiling structures in two or more dimensions , the only examples known being related to solvable models of lattice statistical mechanics ( baake & hffe 2000 ) .",
    "we refer to baake , birkner & grimm ( 2015 ) for a recent review on what is known about the diffraction of partially ordered and stochastic systems .",
