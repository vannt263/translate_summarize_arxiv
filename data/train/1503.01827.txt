    "it is estimated that 70 - 90 % of stars in the galaxy are born in clusters ( lada & lada , 2003 ) . since molecular clumps ( size @xmath7 0.1",
    "pc , mass @xmath7 several 10 @xmath8 ) are the birth places of clusters , understanding star formation in clumps is an important issue for astronomy . toward this goal ,",
    "it is essential to investigate the initial physical conditions before the onset of cluster formation . deuterium fractionation ratios could be useful for probing such past physical conditions of star - forming clumps in their starless phase .    in cold molecular clouds , the observed d / h abundance ratios in molecules ( 0.001 - 0.1 ; e.g. , watson 1974 ; van dishoeck et al . 1995 ; bergin & tafalla , 2007 ; ceccarelli et al .",
    "2014 ) is known to be much grater than the cosmic d / h ratio ( @xmath610@xmath9 ) .",
    "this is due to the exothermic isotope - exchange reactions , such as @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 since their backward reactions are endothermic , the equilibrium deuterium fractionation ratios of molecules depend on temperature , where lower temperatures lead to higher deuterium fractionation ratios .",
    "in addition , depletion of co onto dust grains accelerates the deuterium fractionation below @xmath620 k , because it extends the lifetime of h@xmath13 and h@xmath2d@xmath3 .",
    "in fact , high deuterium fractionation has been reported in evolved low - mass prestellar cores ( e.g. , caselli et al .",
    "1999 ; hirota et al .",
    "ortho - to - para ratio of h@xmath2 also affects the molecular d / h ratio .",
    "the lowest state of ortho - h@xmath2 lies @xmath6170 k above the ground state of para - h@xmath2 , which helps to overcome the endothermicity of the backward reaction of ( 1 )  ( flower et al .",
    "2006 ; pagani et al . 2011 ) .",
    "after the birth of a protostar , deuterium fractionation ratios start to decrease toward the equilibrium values at the elevated temperature .",
    "the timescale for this change depends on the molecular species , and is different between ionic and neutral species .",
    "for example , the main destruction pathways for dnc are reactions with molecular ions , such as dnc @xmath14 hco@xmath3 @xmath15 dnch@xmath3 @xmath14 co and dnc @xmath14 h@xmath13 @xmath15 dnch@xmath3 @xmath14 h@xmath2 . then the dissociative recombination produces cn , although some fraction of dnch@xmath3 goes back to dnc .",
    "the timescale for these reactions is typically 10@xmath16 yr . thus the initial dnc / hnc abundance ratio is almost conserved for this timescale after the onset of star formation .",
    "this is in contrast to the ionic species , which are destroyed by electron recombination in a relatively short timescales ( @xmath17100 yr ) . for n@xmath2d@xmath3 ( n@xmath2h@xmath3 as well ) ,",
    "the reaction with co is the main destruction process above the sublimation temperature of co ( @xmath620 k ) , whose timescale is 1 - 10 yr .",
    "the behavior of the deuterium fractionation in high temperature regions was discussed by many authors ( plambeck & wright 1987 ; rodgers & miller 1996 ; charnley et al .",
    "1997 ; albertsson et al . 2013",
    "; taquet et al .",
    "aikawa et al . ( 2012 ) , for example , investigated in detail the evolutionary change in the deuterium fractionation ratios from low - mass prestellar cores to protostellar cores , confirming the behavior of the neutral and ionic species .",
    "thus , for the neutral species , the deuterium fractionation ratios of active star forming regions reflect those of their starless phase just before the onset of star formation .",
    "therefore , we can extract information of a cold `` starless '' phase from observations of `` star - forming '' regions .    with the above motivation in mind , sakai et al .",

    "they found that the dnc / hnc ratio of the high - mass sources is lower than that of the low - mass sources , and that the dnc / hnc ratio of some irdcs is lower than that of the hmpos .",

    "we suggested that this emission may be related to past star formation activity in the clump .",

    "this discrepancy will be discussed later .    in figures 4c and 4d ,",
    "we present the dnc and hn@xmath1c spectra toward the dnc and hn@xmath1c peaks , respectively .",

    "the dnc peak is about 0@xmath4.8 offset from the hn@xmath1c peak . toward the dnc peak ,",
    "the dnc emission is stronger than the hn@xmath1c emission .",
    "the dnc spectrum shows a double peak , while the hn@xmath1c spectrum shows a single peak .",

    "the hn@xmath1c emission is stronger and broader than the dnc emission .",
    "in addition , the peak velocity of the hn@xmath1c line is offset from that of the dnc line .",
    "since there are no other detectable molecular lines in this frequency range , except for the ( ch@xmath20)@xmath2o lines seen around 75 km s@xmath26 ( figure 4d ) , the broad emission is only due to the hn@xmath1c emission . as mentioned above , the hn@xmath1c peak almost coincides with the hot core position . in figure 4d",
    ", we also plot the ch@xmath20oh @xmath29=@xmath31@xmath32 @xmath30 spectrum ( paper i ) .",
    "the velocity range of the hn@xmath1c emission is covered by that of the ch@xmath20oh @xmath29=@xmath31@xmath32 @xmath30 emission .",
    "thus , the broad hn@xmath1c emission is likely tracing the hot core . since the dnc emission is narrow toward the hot core position , it is likely that the dnc emission comes from a colder envelope rather than the hot core .",
    "the emitting region of n@xmath2h@xmath3 is found to be quite different from that of dnc .",
    "this suggests that these molecules trace different physical conditions .",
    "it is known that n@xmath2h@xmath3 is less abundant in warm gas without co depletion , because it is destroyed by reactions with co. thus , the weak n@xmath2h@xmath3 emission near the hot core and the outflow indicates that the temperature is higher than the sublimation temperature of co ( @xmath620 k ) .",
    "in contrast , the n@xmath2h@xmath3 emitting regions should be rather cold .",
    "as for dnc , the main destruction mechanism is reactions with hco@xmath3 or h@xmath13 , and consequently , the destruction timescale of dnc is much longer than that of n@xmath2h@xmath3 , as mentioned in section 1 .",
    "therefore , the dnc molecule is expected to survive at temperatures above 20 k for @xmath610@xmath16 yr .",
    "since the n@xmath2h@xmath3 emission is weak toward the dnc emitting regions , the dnc emission seems to trace relatively warm regions .",
    "in addition , dnc may be formed on grain surfaces during the cold starless phase .",
    "the sublimation temperature of dnc and hnc is estimated to be about 80 k , if their binding energy is assumed to be the same as hcn ( @xmath33/@xmath34=4170 k ) reported in yamamoto et al .",
    "thus , the abundances of hnc and dnc could increase in hot regions by sublimation from icy dust mantles .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , the dnc peak is offset from the hot core , and no heating source is probably associated with the dnc peak .",
    "the gas temperature of the dnc peak is therefore thought to be lower than that of the hot core .",
    "if the dnc abundance is enhanced due to sublimation , the hn@xmath1c abundance should be also enhanced .",
    "however , the hn@xmath1c emission is faint toward the dnc peak .",
    "thus , it is most likely that the large dnc abundance toward the dnc peak does not originate from the sublimation of icy dust mantles .",
    "the temperature of the dnc emitting regions , except for the hot core , would be in a range from 20 k to 80 k.      we derive the dnc / hnc abundance ratio from the spectra shown in figures 4b - d .",
    "we obtain the abundance ratio by taking the ratio between the dnc column density , @xmath35(dnc ) , and the hnc column density , @xmath35(hnc ) .",
    "the column densities were derived by assuming optically thin emission under local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions . for simplicity , we assume the same excitation temperature for dnc and hn@xmath1c .",
    "we calculate the column densities in the range previously defined : 20 - 80 k at the dnc peak and 20 - 130 k at the hn@xmath1c peak position .    in order to estimate @xmath35(hnc ) from @xmath35(hn@xmath1c ) , sakai et al .",
    "( 2012 ) used the @xmath36c/@xmath1c ratio of 62 , which is estimated from the co and h@xmath2co data by wilson & rood ( 1994 ) .",

    "( 2011 ) , the hn@xmath36c / hn@xmath1c ratio could be higher by a factor of 2 than the @xmath36co/@xmath1co ratio in dense ( @xmath37@xmath710@xmath38 @xmath39 ) regions .",
    "hence , we assume the hn@xmath36c / hn@xmath1c ratio to be 60 - 80 .",
    "the derived dnc / hnc abundance ratios are listed in table 2 .",
    "the dnc / hnc abundance ratio derived from the averaged spectra is higher than 0.06 .",
    "this is much higher than that obtained from the single - dish observations ( 0.003@xmath400.001 : sakai et al .",
    "the dnc / hnc ratio toward the dnc peak ( 0.03 - 0.08 ) is also higher than that of the single - dish observation .",

    "the derived dnc / hnc abundance ratio is 0.001 - 0.004 .",
    "this ratio is comparable to that of the single - dish observation .",
    "however , the emission from the hot core is not the main component producing the emission detected with the single - dish telescope , because the hot core is compact and the spectral shape toward the hn@xmath1c peak is different from that of the single - dish observation ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the dnc / hnc ratio is different between the single - dish and alma observations .",
    "one possibility for the weak hn@xmath1c emission is that the hn@xmath1c emission is so extended that its most part is resolved out in the alma observations .",

    "moreover , the critical density of the hn@xmath1c @xmath0=32 emission is as high as @xmath610@xmath41 @xmath39 , and it is unlikely that such high density regions are extended throughout the clump .",
    "therefore , we do not think that the resolved - out problem is the main reason for the weak hn@xmath1c @xmath0=32 emission in this alma observation .",
    "the most probable explanation for the different dnc / hnc ratios is that the hn@xmath1c emission traces different density regions between the single - dish and alma observations . in the single - dish observations",

    "in addition , higher initial o / p ratio of h@xmath2 molecules leads to lower d / h ratio , as seen in figure 6 . the o / p ratio may be higher in less dense regions ( pagani et al .",
    "2011 ) , which may contribute to relatively low deuterium fractionation in the low density regions .",
    "thus , the low dnc / hnc ratio measured by using single - dish observations is likely due to low density gas traced by the @xmath0=10 lines .    in figure 6a , we can see that the dnc / hnc ratio observed toward the dnc peak is reproduced at @xmath49@xmath610@xmath42 - 10@xmath38 yr at temperature of @xmath50@xmath1730 k , while the dnc / hnc ratio at the hn@xmath1c peak is consistent with the model with @xmath50@xmath6100 k. the constant temperature model , however , would be unrealistic ; the gas should have been cold initially , and then heated by the star formation .",
    "thus , we next consider a sudden temperature rise from 10 k to a given temperature at the time of 3@xmath510@xmath42 yr or 10@xmath38 yr , which simulates the birth of a protostar .",
    "figures 7b and 7c show the temporal variation of the d / h ratio after the temperature - rise with a gas density of 10@xmath46 @xmath39 and the initial o / p ratio of 0.01 ; @xmath49=0 yr is defined as the time of the temperature - rise .    in figure 7b",
    ", we can see that the dnc / hnc ratio does not decrease rapidly after the temperature rise , so that the dnc / hnc ratio toward the dnc peak could be reproduced with relatively high temperature ( 20 - 80 k ) in the temperature - rise model .",
    "after the temperature - rise , the main formation reaction of dnc is dissociative recombination of hcnd@xmath3 , which is formed via dco@xmath3 + hcn .",
    "the dco@xmath3/hco@xmath3 ratio at warm temperature is enhanced by hco@xmath3 + d @xmath15 dco@xmath3 + h in our model calculations . although deuterium enrichment of hnc via ch@xmath2d@xmath3 ( e.g. roueff et al .",
    "2007 ) works in the early time of our constant temperature models , those reactions are negligible in the warm phase of the temperature - rise models ; most of the carbon is already locked into co at the time of temperature - rise and ch@xmath2d@xmath3 is not abundant .",
    "we compare the observed dnc / hnc ratio at the hn@xmath1c peak with the model results at t@xmath610@xmath51 yr , which is the dynamical timescale of the outflow ( paper i ) . in figure 7",
    ", we can see that the dnc / hnc ratio depends on the ratio at the temperature - rise .",
    "if the temperature is raised at 1@xmath510@xmath38 yr , the dnc / hnc ratio after the temperature rise is much higher than observed ( figure 7b ) .",
    "the observed value toward the hn@xmath1c peak is reproduced by the high temperature ( @xmath790 k ) cases with the early temperature - rise ( @xmath173@xmath510@xmath42 yr ) .",
    "thus , the low dnc / hnc ratio toward the hn@xmath1c peak suggests that the temperature toward the hn@xmath1c peak have risen in relatively early time , so that the d / h ratio in the gas and ice ( see below ) at @xmath49=0 is not too high .    in the model calculations , the low dnc / hnc ratio above 90 k originates from sublimation of grain surface molecules , whose dnc / hnc ratio at the cold phase ( 10 k ) is lower than that in the gas phase , as seen in figure 7a .",
    "figure 8a shows the dnc and hnc abundances in the ice mantle and in the gas phase for the constant temperature model ( 10 k ) , and figure 8b for the temperature - rise models ( from 10 k to 60 k or 100 k ) ; the data plotted in figures 8a and 8b are the same as those used in figures 7a and 7c , respectively . in figure 8b , we can see that both hnc and dnc abundances in the gas phase are enhanced by more than one order of magnitude after the temperature rises to 100 k , and remain abundant for @xmath710@xmath51 yr .",
    "if both hnc and dnc were sublimated from dust grains efficiently in the hot core , both hnc and dnc abundances should be peaked toward the hot core in the clump . as mentioned before , this is not the case ; the dnc peak is offset from the hot core .",
    "one possibility to solve this contradiction is a low beam filling factor of the hot core ( hn@xmath1c peak ) ; we proposed in paper i that the hot core consists of a few unresolved substructures .",
    "since dnc / hnc ratio in grain mantle is lower in that in the gas phase , dnc is not significantly enhanced toward the hot core unlike hn@xmath1c .",
    "this enhancement is further diluted by the beam filling factor in the observation .",
    "thus , the enhancement of dnc is hardly recognizable in comparison with the overwhelming dnc emission around the nearby dnc peak . in order to investigate the low dnc abundance toward the hot core in more detail",
    ", higher angular resolution observations would be necessary .",
    "in addition , observations of dnc and hn@xmath1c toward other hot cores would be also necessary for a full understanding .      in this study",
    ", we have shown that the dnc / hnc abundance ratio is relatively high in the densest regions , while it is low in the diffuse envelope .",
    "taking these results into account , we give another possible interpretation of the single - dish survey made by sakai et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "sakai et al . ( 2012 ) reported that the dnc / hnc ratio in high - mass sources is lower than that in low - mass sources .",
    "one possible explanation is that the filling factor of the high density regions is different between observations of low - mass and high - mass objects .",
    "since the low - mass sources are typically much closer to earth than the high - mass sources , the filling factor of the high - density regions may be higher in the low - mass sources than in the high - mass sources .",
    "in addition , it may also be possible that the dnc / hnc ratio of the high - mass sources is lower than that of the low - mass sources for a given density region ( 10@xmath42 @xmath39 ) traced by the @xmath0=10 lines of hnc and dnc , for instance , due to higher temperature . in order to investigate the difference between the low - mass and high - mass sources in more detail , multi - transition line observations with high angular resolution are therefore crucial .",
    "sakai et al . ( 2012 ) also reported that there is a diversity of the dnc / hnc ratio in the high - mass sources , where the dnc / hnc ratio is different even among the objects with similar evolutionary stages .",
    "note that there is no correlation between the dnc / hnc ratio and the distance .",
    "a possible origin of this diversity is variation of the filling factor of high density regions ; the objects with higher dnc / hnc ratio might contain more dense cores .",
    "another possibility is that the dnc / hnc ratio of the densest regions differs from source to source . in this case , the ages of dense regions would be different from source to source . in either case , the diversity of the dnc / hnc ratio could reflect the difference in the history of cluster formations .",
    "observations of the dnc / hnc ratio at a high spatial resolution have a high potential for elucidating the history of cluster formation .",
    "we have determined the dnc , hn@xmath1c and n@xmath2h@xmath3 distributions toward the irdc clump g34.43 + 00.24 mm3 at high - angular resolution with alma .",
    "the results are summarized below .    *",
    "the n@xmath2h@xmath3 emission is anti - correlated with the cs emission .",
    "since n@xmath2h@xmath3 is destroyed by co in warm gas , this anti - correlation indicates that the outflow , which is traced by cs , is interacting with the cold ambient gas . *",
    "the dnc and hn@xmath1c emission is found to be distributed around the hot core .",
    "this suggests that both dnc and hn@xmath1c emission comes from relatively warm regions ( @xmath7 20 k ) .",
    "* the dnc emission is stronger than the hn@xmath1c emission toward many parts of this clump .",
    "the dnc / hnc ratio averaged within a 15@xmath4@xmath515@xmath4 area around the phase center is higher than 0.06 .",
    "this ratio is much higher than that in the previous single - dish observation ( @xmath60.003 ) .",
    "this discrepancy may result from the fact that the dnc / hnc ratio obtained by alma arises from relatively dense regions , which have only a small filling factor in the single dish observations .",
    "* we have compared the observations with simulations with the chemical model .",
    "we confirm that the dnc / hnc ratio depends strongly on the density .",
    "in addition , we suggest that the dnc / hnc ratio after the temperature - rise depends on the dnc / hnc ratio at the temperature - rise . * taking the observational results into account",
    ", we give another interpretation of the single - dish results previously reported by sakai et al .",
    ". the low dnc / hnc ratio in the high - mass sources obtained by single - dish observations are due , at least in part , to the low filling factor of the high density regions .",
    "in addition , the diversity of the dnc / hnc ratio obtained by the single - dish observations among the high - mass sources may be due to the difference in the filling factor of high density regions or the evolutionary states of dense regions .",
