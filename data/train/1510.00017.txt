    "we compare the pressure profiles of a1750 with the universal profiles of a10 and planck13 in the right panel of figure [ fig : deprojentropress ] . while the pressure profile along the filament direction to the north agrees with the universal profile , the profile along the off - filament direction is higher and the profile to the south is lower than the expectation within @xmath1 0.2@xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the profile in the filament direction to the south and to the north is consistent with the a10 and planck13 universal profiles at large radii ( @xmath15@xmath2 ) at the 2.7@xmath20 level .",
    "the pressure to the southeast exceeds the universal models at all radii .",
    "pressure excesses at large radii have been previously reported in other relaxed clusters , e.g. pks 0745 - 191 @xcite , the centaurus cluster @xcite , and the fossil group rx j1159 + 5531 @xcite , and were attributed to gas clumping .",
    "figure [ fig : deprojprof ] indicates that the excess in the pressure along the southeast direction compared to the north or south directions in a1750 is due to high temperature ( not high density ) . on the contrary , clumping ( if it existed in this system ) would bias the density measurements high , leading to an excess in pressure and a decrement in entropy in the outskirts .",
    "therefore , the deviation from the universal profile in a1750 is unlikely to be due to clumpy gas , since other evidence for clumping , e.g. entropy flattening and an excess in gas mass fraction ( see section [ sec : mass ] ) , are not observed in this system .",
    "we note that @xcite reported the detection of a weak @xmath251 , shock resulting from a merger event intrinsic to a1750c along the southeast direction .",
    "this merger event may elevate the temperature and cause deviations from the universal profile . in any event ,",
    "given the large dispersion among pressure profiles of clusters in the a10 and planck13 samples , we do not expect the pressure profiles derived in a1750 in perfect agreement with their results .",
    "the cool @xmath15 1 kev gas detected in regions n@xmath112 and n@xmath113 ( see figure [ fig : nn3 ] ) may be 1 ) the hot dense whim connecting a1750n to the large - scale filament , 2 ) stripped icm gas formed as a result of infalling groups , or 3 ) gas stripped from a1750n itself , as it interacts with filament gas or with a1750c . the feature is relatively extended with an observed radial range of @xmath17 0.62 mpc . assuming a geometry for the merger system",
    ", the mass of the feature can be calculated ( see section [ sec : dynamics ] for the detailed calculation ) .",
    "assuming that the density of the feature is constant within each region ( 5.56 @xmath252 @xmath165 ) , and can be described as a cylinder that extends to 1.2 mpc with a line - of - sight depth of the structure ( _ l _ ) , we obtain a gas mass of 4.13 @xmath253 .",
    "the observed flux of the feature ( 1 @xmath254 erg @xmath29 s@xmath8 arcmin@xmath41 ) , density , and temperature ( @xmath150.8 kev ) are consistent with the expected surface brightness and temperature of the dense portion of the whim , where the large - scale structure interacts with the cluster s icm @xcite .",
    "such a filamentary feature also may be due to an additional small subcluster infalling into a1750n which is being disrupted as it interacts with the main cluster . the bulk of the halo gas lags behind the infalling groups , and is stripped by the ram pressure of the ambient icm .",
    "such halos are expected to have an average temperature of @xmath151 kev with a typical halo mass of 3@xmath255 @xcite .",
    "bright , large - scale ( @xmath15 700 kpc ) stripped tails have been observed in the outskirts of galaxy clusters , e.g. the virgo cluster @xcite , a85 @xcite , and a2142 @xcite .",
    "the stripped gas from infalling halos may seed gas inhomogeneities ( i.e. clumping ) , which suppress the average entropy inferred at large radii . in such systems , a flattening of the entropy profile , as well as an excess in the gas mass fraction as compared with the cosmic value , have often been observed in cluster outskirts . in the case of a1750 , the entropy profile remains consistent with the self - similar prediction out to @xmath2 , and the gas mass fraction is consistent with the cosmic value ( see section [ sec : mass ] ) , implying that the observed cool gas could indeed be the densest and hottest parts of the warm - hot intergalactic medium .",
    "in addition , dense and cool clumps in the outer cluster regions are expected to lead to more entropy flattening since they will lower the average temperature , and , more importantly raise the average density @xcite . along the north direction of a1750n , there is sufficient cool gas to be detected , but it does not cause the dramatic entropy flattening seen in some other clusters , suggesting that its density can not be too high . completely ruling out the ram pressure - stripping scenario for this cool gas",
    "requires deeper _ chandra _ observations with good angular resolution .",
    "the whim interpretation of this feature can not be firmly established based on the _ suzaku _ data .",
    "we present an analysis of the strongly merging cluster a1750 using _ suzaku _ and _ chandra _ x - ray observations , and _ mmt _ optical observations out to the cluster s virial radius .",
    "the deep _ suzaku _ observations allow us to constrain the entropy , pressure , and mass profiles at the outskirts , both along and perpendicular to the large - scale filament .",
    "we use optical observations to constrain the dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "our major results are :    1 .",
    "a1750n and a1750c have a 78% chance of being bound .",
    "there is an apparent hot region with a temperature of 5.49 @xmath24 0.59 kev in between these subclusters implying an interaction .",
    "the red galaxy distribution and the velocity dispersion data prefer a pre - merger scenario . in an early pre - merger scenario ,",
    "one expects the outer icm atmospheres of the subclusters to interact subsonically , driving shocks , and ultimately creating a heated icm region between the subclusters , e.g. , n7619 and n7626 @xcite .",
    "we find overall a good agreement between the measured entropy profiles and the self - similar expectation predicted by gravitational collapse near @xmath2 both along and perpendicular to the putative large - scale structure filament . unlike some other clusters , the entropy profiles at large radii , both perpendicular and along the filamentary directions , are consistent with each other .",
    "agreement of the entropy with the self - similar expectation at @xmath2 in this massive and dynamically young system suggests that a1750 exhibits little gas clumping at large radii .",
    "the gas mass fractions in both the filament and off - filament directions are consistent with the cosmic baryon fraction at @xmath2 .",
    "this may indicate that gas clumping may be less common in such smaller , lower temperature ( @xmath256  4 kev ) systems ( with a few exceptions , e.g. the virgo cluster , * ? ? ?",
    "cluster mass may therefore play a more important role in gas clumping than dynamical state .",
    "4 .   an extended gas ( @xmath17 0.62 mpc )",
    "is observed to the north of the a1750n subcluster along the large scale structure , where one would expect to detect the densest part of the whim in a filament , near a massive cluster . the measured temperature ( 0.8 @xmath51 kev ) , density , and radial extent of this cool gas is consistent with the whim emission .",
    "the thermodynamical state of the gas at that radius ( i.e. self - similar like entropy profile , and gas mass fraction consistent with the cosmic value ) favors the whim emission interpretation .",
    "however , a deeper observation with _",
    "resolution is required to distinguish this diffuse filamentary gas from an infalling substructure , or gas from ram pressure - stripping .",
